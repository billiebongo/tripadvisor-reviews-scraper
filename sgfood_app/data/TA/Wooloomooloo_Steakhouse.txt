Great steaks. Nice wine. Had a very enjoyable evening with attentive services. Quiet restaurant that's a great place for dinner.

Ordered the chope four course menu. Ribeye steak stands out as one of the best i‚Äôve ever had. Service was good but tend to ignore you sometimes D:

My family and I had a birthday celebration at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse last Saturday evening. The ambience was great, the food - fabulous and the service - attentive without being intrusive. We had a wonderful time and a great meal.
5
Though the sirloin is well done but still juicy. The pork chop also juicy... both can eat without any of the sauces though the sauce will make the whole things taste differently..

A chain that started in HK and known for their steaks. We ordered 2 starters , tomahawk to share, and a few sides. Food was was delicious, service was ok. They didnt explain to us what all the various gravy/sauces were for the steak. The steak itself was cook well. A bit too much salt (I would ask them to reduce salt on the steak next time) The decor was a mix between a restaurant or gastro-pub. My only problem with the place was the pricing/cost. Extremely expensive for what it is. For the same price you could eat at Cut-at marina bay sands or other various michelin star restaurants (this place isnt one)Because of the cost/pricing of this place I don't see myself returning here despite the food tasted good. Example: Tomahawk - 1.8kg = 300$ SGD (before 17% tax - 10% service charge, 7% GST)Chocolate lava cake = 30$ SGD (before 17% tax) Tomahawk 2.3kg = 400$ SGD (before tax) A bottle of wine average = 100 SGD (before tax

Had a 200gm grass fed ribeye. Medium rare. It was wonderful, tender and kinda melt in your mouth. Matched with a bottle of red wine. Perfect match.Ambience was good. Serene with good service. Staff was able to introduce and recommended what‚Äôs on the menu with their wine
4
Nice juicy steaks.. good choice between USDA and Australian. Comfortable and pleasant ambience. Steaks had good flavour with a good selection of sauces which weren‚Äôt really needed as the steaks were good on their own. Nice seat and doneness was within range for a medium rare. Good reasonable pricing. Attentive and knowledgeable staff.

It took me 10 minutes to look for the place as I headed to the fairmont hotel, not knowing where Stamford hotel was exactly. Then i recalled that I should access both hotels via the conference halls. Clueless as I was, I sought guidance from the touch screen directory which finally led me to Wooloomooloo. It was lovely inside. Now i was not expecting much from the service staff on Friday evening after having read numerous unfavourable reviews about the lack of service. I was pleasantly surprised as the service for the evening was great! Steak was less than desirable. I ordered the filet Mignon and it was a tad too charred on the outside for my liking. Cutting it up further clears my suspicion of the steak being overcooked. I had requested for medium rare plus. It came a little shy of well done, halfway into it meal, it felt positively tough and dry.My partner ordered a ribeye cut, I took a bite. It was better but I wasn't paying attention as I was trying not to was feel miserable about my expensive yet overcooked steak. Would've enjoyed a $30 steak that I pan-fry myself at home a lot better. And I'm not even being sarcastic.I liked that they had a generous serving of sauces. The largely raved about French onion soup was good for me. The service staff kindly split the soup into 2 servings. However, my partner found it too sweet.Wooloomooloo has a better ambience (interior, and some choices) and view compared to Cut. Cut is a lot pricier but I was well pleased with their steak and the service was far more superior, rightly so.For the given price point, I believe there are better steaks out there. However, I really like the ambience Wooloomooloo provides. Would consider visiting it again during promotional periods but most likely pick something else on the menu

I opted for one of the set menus. Overall, the food had decent flavor. The salad was slightly over-truffled. The steak was so thinly cut I‚Äôm surprised it was cooked to temp, but it was. The cocktail was average. The wine selection was decent with some reasonably priced option. Service was slow, but the staff were super attentive and courteous. Overall, I wish they had put a better foot forward to earn a repeat patron, but I‚Äôm hesitant to return for a solo steak dinner.
5
Kind of came across this restaurant by chance. But very happy we did. The staff were very good. The steaks were cooked to perfection for us and so tasty, didn‚Äôt need the sauces but they were good to try. Very nice touch by Khali (excuse the spelling if incorrect) by topping up our glasses on the balcony for photos. Would certainly go back on our next visit to Singapore.
3
We took the chope set meal.
Food was so-so, very salty. Not worth the price. Service was not fantastic either.
Ambience was great though. Won't return.
4
Decent starters. Steak was good, but the sides were a little salty. Besides that, service was excellent.
4
My friends and I enjoyed our meal in Wooloomooloo. The place is cosy and we were facing the Padang field, what a great view. The food and service was great too
3
We went the night before New Years, wasn't too busy but several items on menu were not available, entree and desert items (hope they restocked for New Years). My main had to be sent back as they had forgot to plate all the sides. My partners steak was advertised as being served with sauces on the side that also didn't arrive. Meals were good but not awesome and they don't come cheap, we've had better in Singapore. They do provide a huge complimentary cob loaf, you would need to be extremely hungry to get through it
4
We made a dinner reservation and informed them that I am allergic to milk and peanut. Upon arrival, I am delighted that they had a special set menu for me. Awesome! Service and food were good. The beef was cooked perfect as what I had requested. The portion was just nice. Enjoyed the dinner very much. Visit Wooloomooloo if you love steak. Price a bit to the high side, but I think worth giving a try
3
Food is good, portions quite small. The service was not very attentive, the mains arrived after a very long wait, one side dish the waiter forgot to order. No one refilled water glasses, and after a long wait with empty plates, had to flag down a waiter to clear the table. At these prices, really unacceptabl
4
We had the 4 course dinner set. The food was excellent and worth the money. The waiters and waitresses showed good attitude but one or two of them need more training. For example, we got the bowl of hot water for heating up my toddler grandson's food only after requesting the 3rd time and 20 min's wait
5
First time dining. Price range of this restaurant is generally high but the ambiance and quality of food makes up for it. There was a set promotion in the month of January 2018 so we booked and tried that. Unlike some restaurants that serves sub-standard food with discounted sets, theirs was of superb quality still! We are definitely coming back to try others. Staff were attentive too
5
Went to Singapore after my nephew's wedding in penang and really fancied a steak... So went here didn't book but thought we would try anyway. They said they was fully booked for at least 1 hour and couldn't get us in....we asked if we could eat in the bar area and kindly said we could.The place looks stunning and you know the food going to be good and boy was it!!..... Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had and I've had some good steaks in some top places... Marcos, Olivers etc.... Owner and staff were very welcomeing and attentive and would like to thank you for a fantastic night and hope to see you soon Anwar.... So if your in Singapore it's a must!
5
We ordered the crab cake to start which was wonderful! Then I had the fillet mignon which as totally cooked to perfection and just melted. Came with 4 different sauces .... Absolutely wonderful. My husband had the steak Wellington which he totally enjoyed .... So tender and cooked to perfection again! The Atmosphere was good and the staff wonderful and jovial !! Would totally recommend and we will be going back before we leave Singapore
5
Excellent service. However, our medium rare steaks (four of us) were not consistent. The brunch menu is value for money.
5
Food was amazing with attentive staffs. Would make an excellent place to have corporate/private fucntions. Memorable night indeed. Woul
5
The restaurant was easy to find, accessible by public transport. The ambience and decoration was so warm and lovely for a Christmas lunch. The staff were friendly and attentive, food was diving and I would definitely come back next holiday!

Strongly recommend this place.
Ambience tasteful, food is fresh, done to perfection n pleasing presentation üëçüèª

I had oyster shells (called kilpatrick), Irish beef (sirloin) and pinot noir red wine. It started really well with delicious onion bread with salted butter, really nice!Red wine was of very good quality too. Then came the food, appetiser - oyster and my suspicion started...that this won't be as good as expected. Oysters were very small, far from those depicted in the menu, just loaded with bacon, huge amount of bacon...killing the taste of anything else. They should call it "a mud of bacon".I had to wait roughly 1 hour for the steak to arrive...ooops. I ordered medium/medium-rare steak, what I get? I super well done, dry piece of cheap looking meat! You can't call it steak, no way! It comes with 4 sauces, with indistinct taste.The main meal felt like bottom range, cheapest piece of meat, almost on the level of a junk food. Oh, almost forgot that we ordered also steamed asparagus, however instead of that they brought grilled (like dark grilled) stuff...with no taste whatsoever.As I was "hangry", I finished it all, paid like in hotel Ritz, for a junk! Please avoid this place

My husband and I came here for our anniversary.We booked a week in advance and got a table. The restaurant wasn't rammed, but had a nice number of other dinners that gave the place a nice buzz. The waiters were also wonderful, very cheerful with a great attitude.We ordered two large glasses of Malbec, a bottle of water, a side of truffle mash potato and steamed broccoli and two of the Australian Angus steaks.They were perfectly cooked, silky in texture and tasted wonderful!The steak also came with five sauces that are all left on your table for you to help yourself to.This was not the cheapest steak I have ever eaten, our bill was around $250, however we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere so much that we thought it was well worth the money.I would highly recommend this restaurant, in particular if it is a special occasion
4
The atmosphere was good. Food was served pretty fast as well. Overall, a good experience. The steak is really up to our expections, really tender with the right amount of fats! Love the Wooloomooloo salad too, especially when it comes with the truffle taste which is so compatible with everything in the bowl!

Wooloomooloo Steakhouse. Located at 2 Stamford Road Level 3 Swissotel the Stamford. This stylish restaurant is elegantly decked out, offers an inviting ambiance. Anyway the restaurant ambience is 5 star , but for service I only can give 2 star .Yes the only good part of the restaurant would be the Ambience ,its lovely , stylish with a nice view of the skyline, But the food is tasteless and service is inactive. Staff seems that they attending a funeral, No one smiled, and no one said thanks for coming we felt invulnerable throughout. To sum up in few words, my dining experience at W STEAKHOUSE ranks one of the basest dining experience in Singapore .Most of the food we ordered, such as their signature, premium steak selections absolutely tasteless, you'd expect way better food when the restaurant bears the name of such a famous celebrity chef the place was a big letdown. This place is VERY expensive and poor value for money definitely overpriced! Maybe our visit was on an unsuitable day

We came back to celebrate Christmas at Wooloomooloo after we had a great christmas meal last year. The whole experience was a bit let down. First, they did not allow their regular menu this year and was restricted to only the set menu. Food was good though. It was served in a timely manner. Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted delicious. We upgraded to the prime steak which cooked to perfection.Restaurant was not full and lacked atmosphere, maybe due to the no regular menu. The music I felt was way too pop for a steakhouse. Service was a bit robotic and lacked warmth like in the past. I will be back during a regular weekend as I still like most of the things about the restaurant and their regular menu which has a good selection
3
Had lunch at Wooloomooloo with my brother on Wednesday. My brother ordered the Wooloomooloo steak - ribeye steak with cajun spices plus a saut√É¬©ed spinach with mushroom and a mushroom soup while I chose the pan seared barramundi and the classic Caesar salad. With Christmas carols playing in the background and the lovely decor, the setting was perfect for a relaxing lunch. However, when the food came, we were somewhat disappointed - the ribeye steak was overwhelmed by the Cajun spices. It was way too salty. As for the fish, it was fresh but the Chef was a bit heavy handed with the salt. Fortunately, the soup, sides, salad and the onion bread that came with the meal were good though the mains did not live up to expectation
5
It's always such a pleasure. Each and every time we go, the entire team takes such good care of us. Needless to say; the food, be it bites or mains, is consistently excellent. Can not recommend visiting as often as possible
4
We went there for dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I had the beef Wellington while hub had beef tenderloin. Enjoyed both our mains!
4
We decided to try the steaks at W Steakhouse after being loyal Morton's customer for years. Cos we got a 30% discount voucher... Arrived punctually for lunch; reception n service thru out the meal was competent but not outstanding or friendly like Morton's. Ordered 3 steaks - Cajun; Sirloin n Rib eye; portion n quality were good.. Accompanying sauces - 4 types were great to compliment the meat. For starters; we had onion soup which was good; crab cake tasty but could be more generous with size n meat. Prawn cocktail was awesome - though only 4 pcs but very fresh; tasty n good size. Overall a good meal; but not exceptional... there's not much of city view to offer cos it's situated at level 3.

I had read all the raving reviews about it before I planned our trip to Singapore. As we were staying the the Fairmont, had decided to do one meal during my visit.Service at best was cold with waiters going about their business with no warm. The host who greeted us was especially rude, who pointed to a table and just dropped the menu. No specials nothing. Then when we started to order were told the 2 things we ordered were not available. Its ok to run out of stuff, but brief us when we sit down. The waiter read out a good 4 or 5 stuff that were not available.Our appetizers took 40 minutes to arrive. Mains took another long wait. They had 4 salts with the steaks which were impressive only for the waiter to drop a spoon full straight on my steak. It was a honest mistake and he was very apologetic, we joked about it, brushed off the salt and that was the only polite conversation we had during the whole meal. Steaks were overly cooked but we just wanted to get over this expensive waste of an effort and left
3
So last nite Dec 19 my partner took me here for my birthday..... first the food and restaurant itself are excellent .... however I found the staff in general a bit stiff n lacking personality .... this started with front of house who behaved like this was the last place on earth she wanted to be ... I have had better welcomes from guard dogs ...... my partner had asked for a window view seat .... just taken to middle of resto with no word n when she asked was simply mumbled back that none available .... ok let‚Äôs no get wound up bout it ..... as I say food itself was excellent ... the ‚Äú moment ‚Äú came when I asked for salt ..... waited came with v nice presentation of 4 salts .... when I asked if any fine salt I was abruptly told no ... ok ... I will have some sea salt .... waiter proceeded to take small spoon to sprinkle salt on my dish .... I asked could he leave to which he replied that was not possible .... ok let‚Äôs no spoil evening .... later manager came to see if all was ok and I asked why cannot leave salt with diners .... ‚Äú oh sir we have an operational difficulty.... I repeat an ‚Äúoperational difficult ‚Äò!!!!!! In that we only have one presentation board for salt .... I just said as in my title above ‚Äú beyond belief ‚Äú .... to be fair he did say he agreed with me fully .... my friends ‚Äú the world is officially gone mad ‚Äú .....

I visited the Wooloomooloo Steakhouse tonight with my wife, mother-in-law and 9 year old daughter. We started off with bread, which was fresh and tasty, however my daughter found a small clump of hair on the bread, we mentioned it to the staff and they were apologetic and replaced the bread in short order. The entr√©e was fantastic, my wife had foie gras, which again came out with a single strand of long black hair, again this was immediately replaced. My daughter and I had the steak tartare which was not too bad and my mother-in-law has the crab lump which she really enjoyed. For the main course my wife had the Beef Wellington which looked like it had Prosciutto ham and included Angus Beef, my wife thought it was over oily and the oil consumed the overall taste, it was not what she expected. My mother-in-law has the Black Angus Filet Mignon which she enjoyed. My daughter and I shared a 16 rump steak which was more than enough for the two of us and cooked to perfection. The sides we chose were baked potato and saut√©ed mushrooms. The baked potato was very large, and we were glade we only had two to share between the four of us and were wonderfully cooked. The saut√©ed mushrooms seemed oily but never the less quite tasty. For desert we shared the apple crumble which wasn‚Äôt too bad, but large enough for three of us to share. We had two bottles of wine with the meal, a light ros√© which was reasonably priced, light and fresh. My wife and I also shared an Australian Grenache which again, for Singapore, was reasonably priced and was quite pleasant. The service was prompt attentive and professional, the team took the time to assist us even though they were a little busy. They did a great job. The only real issue was that there were two different parties also having dinner, one had their young daughter crying for at least a third of the night at a high pitched wail, the son was running around several times throughout the restaurant unsupervised, to both the horror of the staff and other guests. We understand that children cry, however the parents were quite content to let their precious child not ruin their night out but happy to let their children ruin the other guests night. The mother only took the daughter outside to calm her down after the staff politely requested that she might be upsetting other guests. Unfortunately the other child with the second family decided to play duelling crying with the other table just so everyone could enjoy the crying in stereo. The staff seemed to be walking on egg shells all night trying to project a level of harmony between the nonchalant guests and their unwilling victims. The restaurant normally has a great atmosphere however to night it was a SG$1000 a meal cr√®che. This did not ruin the night however it did not make this a memorable experience.

Went for fiancee's birthday dinner. For a place that serves up fare to the tune of SGD$500 for two. (We only had 2 mains and one appetiser and a shared dessert), service was terrible. One male waiter really tried, but even he was not trained at all in fine dining. He tried to re-cork our red wine closed after seemingly over-pouring into our glasses at first serve. no tasing, nothing. Just poured out a breakfast juice glass of wine till my fiancee shouted stop stop. Basic training should have been given.The female manager let a metal curtain fall in my face on the way in. no greeting. Just: "your name? Reservation?" grabbed the menus, led us in and dumped the menus on the table and walked away. It wasnt even rude. She just didnt want to be there. It was completely charmless. We had pre-informed that it was his birthday. Zero mention and they forgot to serve him a free slice of cake that i know is their usual service.Shame. Great ambience, really great kitchen putting out great food. terrible service

If you're tired of Singaporean food and all the delights that the city offers and all you want is a good old-style steakhouse meal, the Wooloomooloo is the place for you. Conveniently located in the heart of Raffles City, you'll forget that you're in the middle of a mall as soon as you walk through the doors. The steak and sides are done just so and please remember to have a glass of wine or a cocktail. The perfect way to end the evening
5
Will like to take this opportunity to thank everyone from Wooloomooloo for a great night. Spend my great 14th wedding anniversary with my wife and kids. This intimate and cozy restaurant is located in the corner of swiss hotel. Always love the warm ambience of the restaurant. This place is so good, that I've always go there for any celebrations or events. Each time we go, we always order the different assortments of appetizers and main. Love my steaks as always! Last but no least will be the strings of desserts that they have. YUM!!!!!You guys have always made it special whenever I am there with my family and friends!Thank you once again Wooloo!!

Went there for dinner with husband as wanted to try out all ‚Äúfamous‚Äù steakhouse in Singapore. However wooloomooloo is the worse ever!! We done our order at 7.50pm, guess what till now (9.30pm) we are still waiting for our main course. The manager told us that there was a bit event as such cos the delay. She offered us more drinks whereby she clearly knew we ordered one bottle of wine. If there‚Äôs a ‚Äúbig event‚Äù going on why the table next to us was not affected at all!!! They came later but their food served first! Just becos they are ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and we are not?? Just becos the event people are all ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and we are not??? After writing so much our food is still not here!!! Really first and last time!!!!! Noisy place with such service plus only so so food. Cut is sooo much better
3
Enjoyed the food here! We had the crab lumps, barramundi, steak and lava cake. They have one of the best lava cake around. Unfortunately, service staff are not very attentive and service was slow
3
Ordered a medium steak that came out well done. Restaurant is priced at the same level as CUT or Mortons but nowhere near the quality.
3
Normally the place is awesome, but my filet mignon was overcooked, my mashed potatoes were room temperature, it took forever for drinks to arrive. I thought I was in a regular Singapore restaurant!
5
From the staff to the steak to the view one of the best steaks in Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyable and would highly recommend if in the area.
2
We wanted to eat well with my wife and we chose this steakhouse for a Singapore dinner on a single evening. When we first came to the restaurant we were well taken care of but left behind.We had to ask the waitress separately to get a drink order.The food was imported at different times with drinks ordered with food and otherwise the waiters were not quite at the level of their duties.I do not recommend this though the main course meat was well prepared and good at this price also need to get good service.The place was a disappointment in price quality in terms of proportion
5
Had a great time celebrating my wife's birthday. I'm no expert on Beef Wellington's but this was better than the previous BW I had at another reputable local hotel. We've had 2 samplings since 2015 and always enjoyed it. There was a great wine selection, so we had a nice SA blend with our dinner. Nice light banter with the service staff, well decorated and partitioned, so even when crowded you never feel the intrusion. We'll be back for sure
5
I chose the sirloin steak at medium and it was good. Had read bad reviews but it turn out everything was good. The service level was quite impressive. We went during weekday lunchtime and the central section of it was full but the attentiveness from the waiters are never lacking. Shared a soup, 2 appetizers, 2 sirloin steak and 2 coffee. No room for desserts. The sirloin steak serving was quite huge. Is 380grams so for steak lovers, you will love it. Paid about $290 for 2 pax.This place is highly recommended for special occasions for the ambience and quality of food
4
Enjoyed the AMEX set menu and food was overall good. Indicated that we are celebrating both bday and anniversay and they prepared an additional choc dessert for us. That was a nice touch. Door host gave no eye contact, no welcome when we arrived and indicated our lunch reservation details - basically we felt that we were disrupting her in the midst of some paper work. Service crew seemed like they were rushing due to shortage of manpower. If you are planning for a special occasion or celebrating, do not expect much from their service. Had gotten better service from similar ranked restaurants or even local steak chain restaurants
3
Came for their 4 and 6 course Amex dinner sets. $150++,$178++ 50% off promotion.Generally the appetizers came in very small portions. The wooloomooloo salad was really small and came with small shreds of beef ($36?) The mushroom soup was nice but v tiny portion too $23. The sauteed prawn was really 1 single prawn in nice sauce ($30?) Angel hair pasta was nice. Ribeye and fillet mignon steaks were nice. Desserts were ok. Lava cake $30. The brownie was warm and soft like a cake. Service was ok. Got 2 of our courses wrong but service recovery by a senior staff was gd so overall I was ok.Requested a quiet table but got seated nearest the kitchen which was noisy and had blocked views. No tablecloth. Casual pop music in the background. Feels like a casual restaurant rather than an anniversary type of restaurant. Though the menu price is more like the latter.Conclusion: nice steaks but overall doesn't justify the regular price. I enjoyed Morton's experience better. Will try Skirt next time.
2
Came here to celebrate a special occasion but was left disappointed. Service was average apart from one attentive male staff. The main course took about 40 minutes to be served after starters, though i do appreciate one of the staff informing us that we had a big group ahead of us about 20 minutes or more into the wait. Ordered a filet oscar medium well, which came out well done and was underwhelming. That said, my partner who ordered the Wooloomooloo steak was happy with his. We will not return
5
If you have an important occasion to celebrate and will like to pamper yourself with a good steak, this is the place to be. The staff are very attentive and super efficient.
3
Went for the weekend lunch set. Good wine pairing
Nice steak and seemingly nice decoration. Service is passable for the price paid.
4
If you're looking for simple (steak) and tasty food in a nicer setting then this is a good place. The menu selection is good - all the comfort food you've been looking for. The staff are all very friendly. Excellent service!
5
A tasted a sirloin from Australia., well done and flowerish of a tasty mushrooms sause , fresh and genuine . The ambient is lovely and romantic with a top view of MBS hotel. The illumination coukd be better ..
5
Great location in Stamford Swissotel, great service as well. Food is very good quality. Suggesting for Couples and Business meetings!
Enjoy!

This can be quite a contradicting review so let me put it out first that I am comparing Singapore 5 stars Restuarant to justify this review.Our family were in the mood for good steak and wanted to try someplace new. I know Wooloomoolooo steakhouse in HK is good so decided to visit the one in Singapore. (We had high expectation)Service staff, 1 Star: they called to inform us they had an event over the weekend but the back ground noise was so loud, neither of us could hear clearly. Throughout the meal, we had to call out to staff several times before we were attended to. Even the bill took time. Between the mains and dessert, our table was not cleaned so we had dirty dishes on the table whilst we wait. We had to call the staff twice to clear the table and this took 2 separate staff to clear a table over 5 minutes. Haiz...feels like having to beg for clean table.Ambience 1 Star: I told them to give me quiet table away from service area. Obviously when I was seated in the middle of the event, I was not happy. Moved us to a table near the kitchen and stove . It was my weekend and I refuse to fuss. Food 2.5 Stars: oysters was served with a dirty spoon, beef tartar was dry and did not come with quail egg, the foe gras not heated properly, taste more like pate it was not melting soft, the pear is tasteless and dry. But(highlight) the Woolomooloo steak was perfect. Rather than the traditional steak, this steak was soaked in their signature Cajun spice and satisfy all our palates. We were even confused if we ever want to go back again. With such strong competitions the food industry, I suggest the re-look at their services. Places I suggest they check out, professional without intruding, at Luke‚Äôs and ME@OUE, all I had to do was to face the service staff and they will be coming. I didn‚Äôt have to call. My table was clean and the experience was fantastic. Even their booking website and calls were professional.Perhaps we go for just the steak and nothing else. The dessert was nothing special but still good.

If you wish to be pampered when u dine in a restaurant it must be Wooloomooloo steakhouse. Jack the General Manager has spoiled us the feeling of being well taken care is simply awesome. Needless to say about their food, its just beyond words we just love it. They surprise the birthday boy with balloons and a cake too that wow us. We had sirloin steak, cod fish, tenderloin, seafood salad and chicken salad. When I desperately wish for calamari which they don‚Äôt have in their menu, you know what Jack made magic for us! Kudos to Jack and their Chef I must really thank them for such great service. Highly recommend Wooloomooloo steakhouse to people who loves to eat beef and not forgetting they have the best dessert my favorite bread and butter pudding. It‚Äôs not the normal stuff it‚Äôs Super tasty that actually I can eat few more of it. The chocolate lava cake taste awesome too so don‚Äôt ever miss these 2 desserts. My friends had Apple crumble and souffl√© comments were very good too. I will sure go back again with my friends who love steaks and good pampering service ‚ù§

~ Introduced by Francis for a company celebration he organized (he knows his food & drink) in 2015Dec, I'd returned for a business lunch in 2017Oct and the place hasn't changed at all~ located in the Swissotel side of Raffles City Shopping Mall, just above the hotels' Kopitiam eatery (not the food court) it's Australian charm starts at the door~ polite hostess & staff are very service oriented and will be accommodating till you ask for the doneness of your steak (it's a steakhouse just order it)... it then comes with their medium and medium rare differences in that the chef likes his medium rare to still have blood red juiciness and if you don't want that (it really is more rare than normal I'd had) you best go for medium or medium well that will turn out the normal medium rare~ I forgot both times and both times years apart I never got to finish my steak, it just came out too bloody for me!!! my bad gotta listen when they tell you seriously~ there is one dish that is SUPER SMASHING consistent that TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE is to die for YUMz x4... once scoop is not enoughSauteed Garlic Prawns both times I'd it was both still too salty so with bread you must!the cr√®me brulee although shallow it's best to share for twosteaks come with minimal garnish & 4 different sauces/gravy standard so it's really a pure cook it good kinda placeall in this is prolly a place for special occasions for the guy on the street who can afford to splurge once in a long while :
5
Amazing location overlooking the Grand Prix circuit with great views from the restaurant and balcony. We were taken there by friends who live in Singapore when we arrived on our holidays and it was so good we went back again before we left! The variety and quality of food was amazing, the steaks are to die for! Jack and his team are a real credit to Wooloomooloo and their genuine hospitality and warmth made our evenings there very memorable. All I can say is "we will be back!
5
I have recently been twice with good friends and i can honestly say they were the best two nights in Singapore. The staff are very warm and welcoming, a real asset to the restaurant (Jack in particular). The food was mouth watering especially the rib eye steak and the chocolate dessert. A big thank you to all of the staff, especially Khali for her superb espresso martinis. Will we be back.... YES definitely
5
We were pleasantly surprised by the service provided to us by the staff on our dinner. Steaks were decent, but what amazed us was their desserts! Would definitely recommend their bread and butter pudding to anyone who visits them.
5
Premium quality steak cooked to perfect doneness, extensive wine selection and beautiful cheeses in town. Highly recommended to try!

I suspect it was another bad night for the kitchen staff. Our oysters kilpatrick was delivered raw without worcestshire sauce. Steak was cooked well but the potato and asparagus side dishes were over cooked (burnt).
5
We went with very good friends who recommended this restaurant for dinner and it surpassed all our expectations. The staff are extremely attentive and catered to all our needs. i would like to give a big thanks to Jack, Darryl, Khali, Nas, Kat,Laurence & Rico and not forgetting Danesh the chef (i hope i spelt your name right). We will definitely be coming back and would not hesitate in recommending this restaurant to anyone who enjoys good food. The duck and the steaks were a particular favorite as was the chocolate dessert. Once again a big thank you to Jack, you made our holiday unforgettable

Went over for a friend's birthday and got served by a friendly and helpful staff named Naz! He was very kind and patient with us being a table of 14. Ordered USDA Ribeye and it got cooked perfectly at Medium Rare with some sides to share. Cheers to the kitchen and floor staff for the good food and excellent service!

Best place in Singapore lots of eating, drinking and generally having a wonderful time in Wooloomooloo, Jack, Darryl, Khali, Nas, Kat,Laurence & Rico and all the team are great, 2 F1's too many Birthdays and way to many Cocktails but all I can say is wonderful.... keep it up guys your simply the best ‚ù§Ô∏è

The staff make the restaurant. The service is absolutely top notch. Special shout out to Mus (moose). From the moment we arrived to when we left, the experience was wonderful. The food was good. The soups (French onion and mushroom) were amazing. The onion loaf was good (not evenly spread) now being picky. The starters were very good as well. The steak was a little fatty and marginally over cooked (they did offer to change it) but I declined as it was marginal. Still tasted good. The deserts were amazing as well to cap off the meal. All in all, a must visit. Not the easiest to find as you have to walk through the mall to get there
4
We took a dinner set comprising a mushroom soup, a tiger prawn in some sauce, main of steak and ending with dessert. The soup and prawn dishes were really quite salty. The serving of bread helps to temper the flavors but still... The steak came late because the original pieces were overdone, so the chef decided to cook a new batch. That‚Äôs what the waiter told us. But it seemed that most customers had to wait. So we were not so sure. It was 75% full on a Friday night. Perhaps the kitchen was short handed? The steaks came out cooked to our requests and was tender, but frankly I didn‚Äôt think they tasted great. Good but not great. Our desserts of cheesecake and lava cake was scrumptious and those saved the night. And the finale was the great service we received when we feed back that the food can be improved. Overall good service and decent food.
5
Jack and his team made this a very memorable evening with great food, superb wine and a very well stocked bar. I loved the atmosphere and the service was perfect, we were all made to feel very special, Jack is the perfect host. I can‚Äôt imagine not going back
1
I took two friends to this restaurant for a get-together as one of them was from out of town. Service was awful! Even from the reconfirm of the reservation, the staff sounded if they didn‚Äôt want me to come. We literally had to beg them to come to get our order. They even walk awfully slow. I was thoroughly embarrassed that I selected this place. First rate prices, fifth rate service and attitude! I will never come again
5
The restaurant has a lovely ambiance with friendly and knowledgeable staff who are always happy to assist. The steaks are second to none in Singapore matched with a great wine list. Pre & Post dinner cocktails are a must with Khali making the best martinis
5
We've been here several times for dinner now, the staff are all super friendly and attentive and the steaks are perfect. Khali makes the most magnificent after-dinner martinis.
5
Excellent and extremely caring servers from the moment we walked into the restaurant.
Food & drinks served are value for money and the servers are knowledgable and good recommendations should you be overwhelmed with the available choices.
3
Been looking forward to going for ages ... sadly food was ok and service was very slow: took an hour from ordering for starter to come so far too Long for a ‚Äúbusiness lunch‚Äù.
5
Excellant attentive service, steaks esp the Tomahawk Wagyu was perfectly done, tender and juicy. Definitely one of THE places in Singapore for a good steak dinner!
5
Great Restaurant , Jack the manager took good care of us and despite setting up for F1 Events that evening made sure we were well taken care of
5
I have always been told by friends and families that this is a 'to go' place and I had always been skeptical about coming because of the price of the food.In the end my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot on my birthday and I can honestly say that this is definitely the 'to go' place as claimed by my friends.Let me start with service - From the exceptionally polite hostess to the professional and friendly wait staff, the restaurant has obviously hired the best people the industry has to offer. Even though it was a busy night, they were all smiles and they never failed to check on us regularly and even found time to make jokes and small talks. Now, I have friends who works in the industry and they have always told me how hard it is to create rapports with guests when it is busy but the service staff here are obviously great at what they do because they are still able to go through the rush hour and still be able to find time to make friends with us and their other guests with ease.Now with food - Being a steakhouse, my girlfriend and I decided to have steaks and my my do they do they have the right to take pride in specializing in steaks. And it's not just their mouth-watering steaks, they have a wide variety of appetizers (try the jumbo crab cake!) and a chocolate lava cake that is simply sensational! And to top it off, they gave us a complimentary slice of cake with a birthday message and a candle specially for my birthday! Not something that you will get in a lot of restaurants. In a nutshell, this is a gem and in a country like Singapore where consistent good service and food is hard to find, this is one restaurant that will undoubtedly provide that. I will definitely recommend this to my friends.To both the kitchen and service team, we will see you soon

I have been going to wooloomooloo on and off for the past 5 years and have always received great service from Jack and his team. There are the usual names Kat, Shafiq, Darrell who have been there and made me feel special every time. I never wrote a review because i had come to expect this, but last night i received the unexpected from Jack.I had just walked into a restaurant in London with my wife, and within a few minutes of sitting down two glasses arrived at my table from the manager. I had not ordered this but soon learnt that it was from Jack who was sitting with his family having dinner on another table. Completely unexpected but remarkable, even on holiday he is still paying attentions.Cheers Jack, you are remarkable.Pete

I booked the restaurant for 2 people and when we arrived at 8:45 it all started very badly with a cold welcoming. Then, and despite the restaurant being only 10% busy, they crammed us between two tables giving us a table for 6 peopleWhen we requested a quieter corner, the waitress told us that that section was already closed. Finally, she proposed that we move to the half booth where we settled.Then, immediately after we ordered we were asked if we had any last order for food, despite the restaurant‚Äôs opening hours are advertised as 11pm.The service was really not up to the mark and we always had to wait for any request we had (additional butter, etc.) which is quite annoying given the price you pay. They also ran out of their signature dish (wooloomooloo steak).On the other hand, the food that we had was really good- Steak tartare as a starter- Rib eye with b√©arnaise- Filet of beef Wellington- Steamed asparagusThe wine list is quite pricey too with most of the red wines starting at SGD 115 and a very limited choice of bottles below SGD 150!Before we were finished eating we were presented the bill - without anyone asking if we wanted more wine (which we then ordered) or coffee etc.. So overall a below par experience for a meal that was nearly SGD 500‚Ä¶ Definitely not up to other peers like Mortons, Luke‚Äôs or Bar Roque

stayed in singapore for the grand prix and stumbled upon this gem. :) ;) :)in sunday the day of the race found a corner of a balcony where had the best view in singapore of the f1 track. they also had a beverage package where you can drink free flow champagne, beer and whiskey and gin. INCREDIBLE, my friends and i had such a great time, the restaurnt also showed the race on a tv so was always uptodate on the race. will be back again next year and the year after and after that too. fur more years
2
The steak was burnt and overcooked. We ordered medium but the steak was nearly well done. The same thing happened to the salmon too. Salmon skin was charcoal black. Had to throw it away, such a pity!
5
Great ambience, restaurant manager made sure that their guests are all well taken care of. Attention to detail made dinner felt a whole new level of service experiences. Recommended.
4
A suitable dining place for couples and families. Both food and service are good, and i love their molten lava cake
5
As a regular here. The service is always excellent and the food is always excellent with quality produce used. Excellent drink menu as well.
3
The food and atmosphere is good, but I expect a better services for this high end restaurant for the price we are paying. Can be better.
4
Steak was done just right and the grand marnier souffle was to die for.
Also thoroughly enjoyed the onion bread which was fresh and warm.
Had good service from our attentive waiter, Lawrence, too.
4
Ordered Sirloins (Australian and Irish) and they were really great! Service is very good although the steaks took around half an hour after ordering.
5
We had a great experience at Wooloomooloo. We weren't expecting the surprise desserts and wine from the steakhouse. Commendable service too! Will definitely be back again. Thank you so much for the effort made, deeply appreciate :)
5
We've spent an evening at this place celebrating my wife's birthday. It was a very pleasant visit - service is very nice, waiters are friendly and helpful. If you are going to this place, you definitely have to try beefsteaks, they are incredibly tasty and well cooked. We would recommend this place for family and friends meetings
3
Celebrated wedding anniversary on Saturday 9 September. However, steak was ordered for medium-rare but came medium-well. Chef recooked another slab, which came back ok but tasted so so. Wife's chicken was so so... Overall, felt that the last time I visited in early 2017 was better. May have been due to a busy Saturday night this time, as acknowledged by our waiter.
4
Venue was nice, with a view to the church. Service was excellent. Over ordered and waitress offered to waive off the order.
4
It was our first time at Wooloomooloo and it was a great experience. Food and service was great. Will definitely be back again.
4
When I went they had only the brunch set menu available but it was really good. Nice balance of food and it was delicious as well. Will come back next time and try their ala carte menu.
5
We ordered to share:-jumbo lump crab cake: full of crab chunks and tasty, but the salad side was quite bitter-cream of mushroom soup: tasty and portion was just right Wooloomooloo salad: absolutely love this dish! The beef was so juicy and tender and the greens w dressing were yummy. -john stone sirloin: ordered due to waiter's recommendation. Best decision ever! The meat was so tender and juicy we chomped down the food-truffle oil mac and cheese: anything truffle won't go wrong and this dish is really good!
5
I've been here many times and it is still my favourite steak house in Singapore. (Closely followed by Bedrock).The service is excellent and Jack is wonderful with his wine selections and attention to detail. The food never fails and it delivers above and beyond. Looking forward to my next visit
3
was disappointed to be told that wooloomooloo steak was run out 30mins after ordering, due to big group of ten people, i had to wait close to an hour for my fillet mignon and rib eye. however, the scallops and foie gras exceeded expectation. i would not come back agai
5
We went for the Promo Menu and what a good experience! It's really value for money and my friend and I enjoyed our dinner very much. We even had complimentary starters "Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare" from the restaurant Manager - so generous of him and you know what wow it's so yummy. I will be back again and I will definitely order "Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare"!
5
We stumbled on this little gem on our first night in Singapore and were lucky to get a table without a reservation. The food is outstanding, foie gras, filet mignon, beef wellington! All in very nice surroundings with friendly and helpful service. Expensive but worth every Singapore dollar
5
We went to Wolloomoollo for brunch. The brunch with free flow champagne at 118sgd++ is a good deal. On top of the champagne (currently Moet&Chandon ), you can also have some other wines. The Tasmanian Pinot Noir and the Chianti classico were good. They are serve chilled, which is good for the Pinot, but a little too cold for the Chianti. The food is very pleasant. That week, it was a small Moroccan ratatouille with a quail egg, then a nice Thai beef said, with chilies and lemongrass. Sirloin meat is good and we enjoyed the toffee pudding. Nice view of the skyline from the window. It was not so crowded for a Sunday brunch, but this place deserves to be better known. If a la carte, the wine list can be expensive but has some good names. A reserve de la Comtesse 2010 at 180sgd for instance is probably one of the best bets. Good selection of half-bottles, like a Tignanello half bottle at 160sgd.
4
I liked it here, good atmosphere and the service was terrific but the steaks were probably just OK.I chose the sirloin and it didn't have than usual depth, you know the NY or Aussie cut that is the mark of a good steak. It was flag and a little gristly at the edges.The sides were great but again $$$$.Wine list is good.Wouldn't hurry back and would try somewhere else next time but it was close, convenient and OK
3
The staff is friendly. The weekend brunch menu change bi-weekly. The steak wasn't really that great but can't expect much for the price paid.
5
Had a good meal today for lunch! Steak was perfect and juicy! Staff was helpful and friendly especially the assistant manager Khali! Thank you for providing such great service!
5
I have truly enjoyed the food here. The steak are done to the correct doneness and the staff is able to recommend and explain the various choices of food variety available there.
5
Had a wonderful experience on a date night. Extremely attentive service staff who made diners feel welcome. Ordered succulent scallops, fresh oysters along with tender porterhouse steak to share. Completed with a rich hot chocolate cake and peppermint tea. Thumbs up!
4
Great steak and lovely evening !!! My husband was celebrating birthday and we received a lovely complimentary cake. Always love coming back for special ocassions
5
I love wooloomooloo steakhouse. And they recently started the mootini nights which comes with their signature selection of martinis and complimentary steak sandwich. Bar scene is really vibrant with super amazing views of the marina, not crowded as the tables are nicely spaced.The staff are very friendly and service is efficient. The English Manager Jack, is a very friendly and takes care of all your needs and entertains you. Will be back soon
5
Wonderful food and amazing service. I first dined at this place when they opened 5 years back and have been a regular since. I have left happy every single time. And when great service and food is a norm you start taking it for granted. Only when you go to some other restaurant in town and have a shocking experience do you realise what an amazing job Wooloomooloo steakhouse has done. It has just about the same team since as long as I can think of. You walk in and see the familiar faces welcoming you and treating you like kings. I have never felt an urge to write a review about any restaurant up till now. I go back to good places and never return to places that I dont like. I am putting up this review as testimonial to the amazing man behind Wooloomooloo, Jack Fraser! He is most charming host and expects nothing but the best from his team. Everyone is on the ball at all the time and they manage to left the roof off every single time. I am a fan
5
We were to celebrate our Anniversary and of course we had high expectations. From the beginning till the end the service we received was impeccable. The Scallops we ordered was so delicious and well prepared that i'm thinking of ordering 2 more plates! There was a slight glitch as the beef wellington was not able to be served to our liking . On the other hand, the service recovery given for that was mind blowing. Before serving our main meal, they apologised for the wait and gave us a complimentary truffle pasta with ikura that has the best explosion of umami flavour! We didn't even realise we waited long as we were really well taken care of. The molten lava cake we had was perfectly oozing. The anniversary dessert was also perfectly smooth with crunchy bits at the bottom. At the end of our meal when we asked for the bill, Mr. Jack Fraser said one sentence that is engraved in our hearts forever. What he said i will not reveal it here as i would like it to be only for us.Be rest assured that you would not be disappointed and will be having the best meal of your life at Wooloomooloo. Dear Jack, we will be back again as promised

The rating I gave is a reflection of the steaks that were served. This is unfortunate as this establishment is supposed to be a steakhouse.We were a party of 11 and 3 of our steaks were so salty that they had to be returned to the kitchen.My Australian ribeye was not rested properly and was damp and overly salty.To be fair, a few in my party liked their steaks.The appetisers and sides were good - most of us likes the lobster bisque.The Malbec - which was the cheapest wine in the wine list was good too.And last but definitely not least, our server was a star who made us felt like we were dining at home
2
Wifey and I ordered 2 starters : one crab cake and the other tuna tartare. The food was OK. Just a 3 rating. But the portion is tiny and you are paying more than $35 each for the starter!! As mains we got usda and the Irish steak and we were advised by the server that the former has the best marbling and the latter is fattier. What we got in the end are two driest steaks that we ever in our life. To be honest even the steak served by the western cuisine stall at my house 's nearby coffee shop taste so much better. Avoid this place at all cost. There are so many other better options out there.
5
Service crew was incredibly attentive and friendly. Needless to say, the steak served was perfectly cooked!
4
Nice place with lovely staff. We ordered two 1kg steaks for a big group, but the steak was extremely rare (we asked for medium rare). Not the best steak i've had, but reasonable value for the portion size.
5
Was there early for MOOtini night, martini was 1 for 1, and the complimentary steak sliders were so yummy! Went in next for dinner and from the steak to the sides, every item was superb!
5
I always love their rib eye steak. The medium rare cooked perfectly. Try their truffle mac and cheese as well.
5
We were here just to enjoy lunch. We ordered a lobster bisque, salad, pasta and steak. All very delicious and good portion. We shared all the food and left this place feeling satisfied. Oh yes, very nice complimentary bread and good service too.
2
We went for a birthday celebration. There was a big table next to us with a group of professionals. They ordered at least 20min later than us. We waited for almost an hour for our steak. The steaks were prioritised to be served to the other big table, despite the fact that they had ordered later than us. We kept asking the restaurant what's going on and they just asked us to wait because they were busy. Finally the steak was served but we already lost our appetite. No one proactively came to explain or apologise. The birthday dinner was ruined and we were so disappointed. The feeling is so strong even it has passed for almost a year.
5
The service provide by Naz, not sure if I got his name right. But the service he provided really made the night for me.We were waiting for the hostess to return from sitting someone to send us to ours seat, he saw us standing there and came to assure us that the hostess is coming. He continually checked up on us thru dinner to make sure everything was going well and we were enjoying our meal.My Beef Wellington came with the puff pastry a tad undercook but everything else was perfect from the soup to the starters. I casually mention it to him when we were getting our checks and he immediately apologise and did service recovery for us.I am really impressed by the service and would definitely go back again.
5
We are regular visitors to Wooloomooloo and we find it necessary to write a review. This steakhouse isn't as well known as some of the others in Singapore but it is definitely just as good. The starters are always excellent - the oysters and lobster bisque are recommended along with the foie gras. The tomahawk steak is always very tender and very tasty - one of the best in Singapore. The service is just as good as the food. If you're a steak lover, this restaurant is a must visit. Highly recommended
4
This is one of those restaurants that you would revisit, for their services and foods.They helped us to make our choices and make good recommendations.Our 3 steaks were very well prepared, although it was a bit too salty for my taste, I enjoyed it.The deserts we had were lemon lime pie which crust was a bit hard, but cream were light and tasty, then bread butter pudding was fantastic and a must-try.It was a S$500+ dinner for 4
4
I chose this restuarant to celebrate my husband's birthday. The food was faultless. My husband had the cajun steak and it was melt in the mouth. I had the sirloin and although very well seasoned and tasted delicious, it was slightly fatty but this more to do with the cut. I would recommend one of the other cuts of meat. The sides are delicious as well as a mouth watering selection of sauces. As it was my husband's birthday the staff made him feel extra special including a complimentary birthday dessert with candle. Definitely a great place to celebrate something special. There will not be any change left in the wallet but well worth it
5
Had went to the restaurant for my 6th year anniversary. They specially decorated my dining table and even take a photo to place it into a card for us. Service is tip top
5
Thank you to the wonderful staff at Wooloomooloo last night for making our evening so special! We will be back!
5
Went there for birthday celebration and the restaurant provided great service with free decorations for table and complimentary cake and photo. Also get to enjoy the fireworks from nearby ndp rehersals!
the food was great too and service was good!
4
Wooloomooloo is my favourite steak restaurant in town. The prime rib eye is the best. The quality is comparable to Cut in MBS but price is only half.
3
Served decent nice steak, ambience is good but noisy restaurant on a Friday night. Was hoping for Panna Cotta for desert but they does not have it in the menu. Might want to spruce up more on the menu, such as serving Tiger Beers, etc.
4
Celebrated my boyfriend's parents' birthday and anniversary. The ambience was great and the food was really good! The staff were really friendly too.
5
Steak was cooked well. With a nice crust and tender juicy centre. The 4 different sauces was a treat! Creamed spinach was excellent!
5
I have been going to chop house @katong over the last year and have always been impressed by the food if not the service and of course its more to my budget. I bought my father to this lovely restaurant on Fathers Day and I think he had the best western dining experience of his life. He has been going on and on about it with all the friends and relatives till today considering its been 2 weeks since the meal. Service was top notch and surprisingly warm and friendly. There is genuine hospitality and servers and managers go out of the way. Food was very very good too. I just wish the staff at chop house could copy a tiny bit of hospitality from you. I wish I could come to Wooloomooloo more often but I will think of no other place when it comes to special occasions
4
The a la carte menu was not available for lunch (only dinner); only the 5-course set lunch was available. The set menu was disappointing. It looked good but failed to live up to expectations. Having a bit of everything (soup, salad, etc.) is a nice idea, but not to be done at the expense of quality. The itsy-bitsy steak main was the real disappointer. I suppose for a real good size steak, one must have dinner and not lunch. Disappointing because the issue is not the price, but rather expectations borne of reputation (and slick marketing)
5
Was happy to return to Wooloomooloo with a group of friends to enjoy the private dining room.It was a great setting, comfortably seating 14 of us and everyone was over to moon with the amazing steak and service.Jack and his team are so professional and attentive. From the planning, to the pre-drinks in the bar, menu selection and assistance with the wines, it was a absolute pleasure to have them look after us.Highly recommend this restaurant and the standards are always extremely high every time I return
4
Great Beef Wellington; worth the wait because freshly cooked but expensive. Enjoy with crab lump salad but the apple crumble is a step too far and not the best I've had.
5
Very nice view, excellent cocktails from Naz. Wonderful service from Khali! Overall a great place for hang-out! Simply love it. Will be back for sure! Excellent service! Thank you for making our girls' night out so splendid!
5
Service was exceptional. They gave us another bowl of lobster to dip bread with when the bread took awhile to come. That was quite a pleasant surprise.
3
We went for the Father's Day brunch, which was pretty underwhelming for the price. Service was good, but not anything to write home about either.
5
Love Wooloomooloo.
Jack and his team are the perfect hosts. Highly recommend it - great cocktails and superb bar
5
The service was impeccable with drinks flowing continuously by friendly and very accommodating staff. I highly recommend this place for small and large groups and look forward to my next visit!
5
3rd time back, Foie Gras and crab cake best in town. Excellent service from Jack (restaurant manager n staff (naz).
We will be back for more great foie gras n steak...
4
Made a reservation for a friend's birthday celebration here and was pleasantly surprised by the meticulous service. The restaurant called to make sure that the reservation was confirmed at least twice before the actual date. The atmosphere was nice and we got seats with a nice view. The lighting I thought could be slightly brighter though. We ordered some drinks and starters to begin with, it would have been good if the one for one deals for Martini are available for diners at the restaurant and not limited for the bar. The foie gra, crab meat,oysters starters were not too bad. Ordered the fillet mignon and wooloomooloo steak for mains and the portions were huge at 8 to 12 ounces. Personally I preferred the fillet mignon as the wooloomooloo steak was preseasoned with Cajun spices. Steaks come with a variety of sauces and mustard. The staff were really attentive and kept checking with us that the food was okay and if it's to our liking. Although I wasn't expecting anything extra, the staff offered a nice birthday dessert for my friend. I really had a good time overall and appreciated how engaging and helpful the staff we're throughout our meal
5
Last time I reviewed Wooloomooloo I was not a happy bunny as they had let me down badly on one prior occasion (and I'm a regular). I'm pleased to report they sorted it and are back up to the expected standard. We had a great night out on Friday, steaks perfect, sides hot, service top notch. thank you

Visited with my family for my father's dinner. Was informed by wait staff that aircon was down- resulting in a tepid environment for the meal. Starters was delicious, but did not expect to pay $23 for a small serving of French Onion Soup. Additionally, the steak, prices from $60+ to $200+), was served only with a small bunch of watercress. Steak was decent, but was slightly undercooked- the medium rare was bloodier than expected. The waiter recommended the Miyazaki A4 Wagyu beef 1-for-1 deal, but the beef that my boyfriend received had quite a fair amount of tendons. Serving portion for the Wagyu was small too.The worst part for me was the desserts. Ordered Raspberry Souffl√©, but the sides of he souffl√© was coated with pure sugar. The souffl√© was overwhelmingly sweet for $24++. There was mouths that I was just eating sugar. As a person who loves dessert, I had to give up halfway. Additionally, the wait staff who was serving desserts just left the desserts on the table without serving it to respective diners. She had to be prompted to tell us which dessert was which. For a restaurant of this value, that was quite appalling. Heard pretty good reviews of this place- but did not expect this standard of food and service. Not once during the meal did anyone came to ask us how did the meal go- this level of attention for this bill does not tally.Hope they'll improve on their service soon
5
Not only does it has a sleek and sexy interior, but most importantly, it offers top-quality Aussie beef.
5
This is a high level place with quality food. I had a lobster bisque and an Australian Angus fillet. Very tasty and well presented. Staff is professional and friendly. It is expensive.
4
This will forever be my go to place to satisfy my steak craving. Great quality of meats. Pound for pound, even better than Mortens I dare say!!
5
Food was good..e 120ounce Wooloomooloo steak is sooo good! The man was smiling fm ear to ear aft first bite! Service staff was nice n frenly...but a lil noisy on a friday lunch time. Overall was excellent!
5
Pricey, but if you accept the cost, food and service were up to par.
Steak was cooked well and wait staff were attentive and polite
3
Food was average and service was bad, bread is only served after we finished our appetizer and soup.......terrible
5
I've always loved the Wooloomooloo brand; it's brought back great memories for their slabs of beautifully grilled steak. I've come here multiple times for the meals but for brunch?! Never before till now. This is in my wife's words, the most "understated brunch ever". We were here for their weekend brunch and chose the S$98++ set which came with free flow wine, spirits and beer, including prosecco. With a solid 5-set course paired with an alcohol selection spanning 6 pages with everything on the menu up for grabs, I could never been left a restaurant in the afternoon feeling higher than a kite and happier than a satisfied customer. With the price and menu on selection, this boozy brunch is absolutely worth it! Give it a try! They rotate their food menu every 2 weeks so you can come by bi-weekly for a new culinary experience!
4
Visited here with business associates, it served several types of Beef steak menu, also, there are choices of pork, lamb and fish. The ambience was great and waiters were attentive ! Good for group or solo. Overlooking to MBS and Marina area from the restaurant was great !
5
We had my husbands 50th birthday lunch here, selecting the lunch menu. The restaurant was quiet..only a few other dinners in, but it still has a nice atmosphere. The service is exceptional..very attentive. There were four adults and my nine year old daughter. We were given the most delicious hot onion bread with salted butter to share..it was so delicious we asked for more! You didn't need a starter! We ordered steak and frites, and my friend had cheek and mashed potatoes. We all thoroughly enjoyed our mains..all cooked perfectly. We chose deserts off the lunch time menu,(much cheaper!) but they let my daughter have the hot chocolate pudding off the main menu,(normally $30!) for free as it was my husbands birthday. His desert came with a candle and "Happy Birthday" written in chocolate! He was suitably embarrassed when we sang Happy Birthday! As it wasn't busy we had a lovely long relaxing lunch. Great service, great food with great company...we'll go again
3
When I arrived at the restaurant at 630pm, it was not too crowded and I was brought to my table pretty soon.Bread and water were served almost immediately after we sat down.After ordering my food, I ordered two mocktails as well. When the mocktails came, one of them looks like it was already drank by someone. How is it that one glass was filled to the brim and the other glass was significantly lesser? The glass with the lesser drink even has the "water mark" near to the brim. Next, we ordered two medium-rare filet mignon but one came out to be almost medium-well and the base was charred. Pretty disappointing for a steakhouse.When my partner was done with his main course while I was still having mine, the manager came to take away his plate and asked if he wants his dessert to be served now. Well, can't you see that I am still having my main course? It made me feel like you are rushing your customers.Generally, there are still many areas to be improved on and for the price given, there are other better steakhouses around
5
Great meal, had to book as it gets busy. Fabulous steaks, wonderful wine. Service is good, staff very helpful. Good views of the city.

Our lunch went slightly over 300 (it was ~306 dollars if I rem correctly), the manager comped the 6 dollars without us asking. Nice gesture.

Steak was good! We enjoyed our dinner experience! Look out to purchase chope vouchers to save some $$

came here for a dinner with pals. service was good. food not fantastic. price was expensive. may not come again

WooLooMooLoo Steakhouse has been my go-to destination for the best steaks and ambiance in Singapore for the past 8 years. It's the best of the best for steakhouses here, and is a totally relaxing environment. Multiple thumbs up!

I went with 7 other friends for dinner on a sunday night. Do make sure that you make a reservation before you go there. Great ambiance, friendly staff. We ordered 2 tomahawk steaks and the waiter brought them out before they cooked the meal. A very interesting experience.Try to get a view to the CBD area, it's really beautiful at night. In the end we spent about $100 per person. But considering the quality of the food, service, and location, it's not a high price to pay. I've tasted the same quality of steak and paid double the amount before, so this is a better choice for me and my friends

Joined for dinner with friends at Wooloomooloo, the service was friendly and attentive. During the evening the person next to me knocked over his glass of wine which flooded my plate. Inn a heart beat the plate was exchanged and the mess was mopped up. I was happy that the food was replaced it was a lovely act, sadly the second dish was awful, i feel this was due to the attitude of the chef who got so angry when the service staff was trying to get it replaced, i watched from the table near the kitchen as the server tried to justify the act to the aggressive chef, it was obvious that the chef did not want to cook my salmon. Again the service staff noticed that we had caught on to the incidednt at the kitchen and they called the manager who came and spoke to us. We ended up having a drink in the bar at the end of the night

Seven of us went to Wooloomooloo for lunch during the Restaurant Week.The appetizers and desserts in the special menu were dull. The main courses that we ordered (braised wagyu beef cheek rigatoni and Australian ribeye) were both salty, especially the rigatoni. We had to ask for water multiple times and we had to wait for at least five to ten minutes for it to be served. After we got our dessert, we also waited for a long time for the spoons. The slow service might be due to the crowd during restaurant week. However, the restaurant was only 70-80% full. I can‚Äôt imagine what it will be like if it‚Äôs a full house
4
Service was much better than the food served. Arrived with much expectations as I had been reading about the restaurant for some time. Was eager to compare the steaks against other steakhouses. As it was a full house, we were politely asked for our understanding on a slightly slower service that evening. It was very much appreciated and the other waiters and waitresses made us feel very welcome. Huge plus on the service aspect.Appetisers were not too bad. However, the mains failed to impress and of the 4 that were ordered (Sirloin, Wooloomooloo, Porterhouse, and Wellington), only the Porterhouse stood out. 1 out of 4 is hardly a job well done.Still, appreciate the service, which saved the evening for us

Very happy evening, very impressed overall. Lisa the hostess is excellent. Her smile is welcoming & her attitude is perfect. Some upmarket restaurant has "atas"'hostess but Lisa is a great service example. She guided me to the bar and introduced Daryl asst manager of restaurant. Daryl has "wow" us the entire evening. His service was friendly n prompt, professional & he is knowledgeable. He can suggest good menu items. The ambience is excellent. The food quality is good. We love the oysters n foei Gras. The wine we chose "Margaux" blown us away. In addition we like to compliment Naz who is friendly & helpful. Restaurant manager was polite too, came to greet us.
5
The staffs are polite and fast respond
Ambience is nice
Food are super delicious, is really worth for the price.

I have actually requested for a cake for my mum's 75th birthday. But the restaurant informed me that they do not serve cake. They said they can write birthday wishes on our desertplate if we ordered set lunch menu, which we did but no message at the end. It will be fantastic if restaurant can cater to special ocaasions with surprises to appeased the customers. Steak is kind of small cut for the price. So it is $$$$ for me
5
Went there for a birthday dinner with my girlfriend and they specially decorated the table, subtle and suffice! They surprised both of us with a birthday chocolate mousse cake, took a picture and had it printed and given to us. Its really the special touch that they gave that makes the place memorable!Highly recommended
5
Went there for our anniversary celebration and they had awesome service and steak! Will definitely go back and recommend others

We ordered set lunches. It would be perfect/complete if coffee/tea was includdd as part of lunch deal :

Planned a birthday dinner for the hubby at this cosy steakhouse as he simply loves steak. We ordered foie grass, jumbo crab cake for starters. They were superb. The steaks were Surprising tender and juicy. We didn't have room for desserts as we were too full. spent about $250. Overall, it's a great experienc
5
Great ambience. Service staff was very attentive and offered to bring us through the menu. Food was excellent, steak was cooked to perfection. Value for money
5
Service staff was really friendly and attentive. Has initiative and polite in answering our questions. Definitely a place I will go back to
4
Family dinner. Order porterhouse steak, oysters, mushroom soup, goose liver and desserts. Good ambience and friendly helpful staff Will definitely patronize again.
5
Good service and food. Nice ambiance but maybe choose a table that is not near the open kitchen. 'Smoke' filled up the section everytimr they Cook a dish
5
We had dinner here and the meal was amazing and the service was so good we were treated like VIP . Nothing was a problem to Jack and his friendly professional staff
4
The staff are very attentive and service was good. We had a good time and the food was delicious. An enjoyable evening with hubby.
3
food was great as usual but service was disappointing. waited long time to be served wine etc. not just 1 staff, several of them were unattentive
4
had to nip out for a call. Came back and was told to wait a while as they had brought my crab cakes back and would be preparing me a fresh crab cake. Pleased with the service.
5
Wooloomooloo is a great steak restaurant. The food was perfectly cooked with very little waiting time. Slightly on the expensive side but the food accompanied with the view was well worth it
4
We had the Executive Set Lunch, which was pretty good. The tuna with Nicoise salad starter was delicious. My companions who had the French onion soup also enjoyed it. Great start.We all ordered the Fillet Mignon for mains. One of us wanted it well-done (I know..), I ordered it medium and the other asked for rare. Only the well-done was not overcooked, which was a pity, because the steaks were well charred on the outside, just the way it should be. It was also the toughest fillet steak I have ever had, for some reason. Even when overcooked, fillet should remain tender. Still, the potatoes fried in duck fat was good, and the caramelised onions were delicious. The watercress seemed like an afterthought, with longish tough stems not trimmed from them, but the dressing was good.The tiramisu looked pretty with the berries garnishing and tasted ok.Overall, for $60 without drinks, it was a reasonably good lunch. Service was good
4
We went there with a group where we had a set menu. The beef cannelloni and slow cooked wagyu cheek was delicious though the service was slo
5
Visited here for really nice brunch post cruise.We were not disappointed. The food was all freshly cooked and nice sized portions. This was very good value for money. Staff all very friendly and helpful.Would definitely recommend this for a good meal and would return if I every visited Singapore again
1
Steak undercooked. Waited one hour and 15 mins for a table. Hostess let others in before even though we were there first. Chef having a tantrum in the kitchen

We went to Wooloomooloo Steakhouse for a 'romantic Valentines dinner'. It was our choice, but i believe its best to go on any other day...There was a set menu for Valentines with choice of three mains. Being it a Steakhouse we opted for the Filet Mignon. What a terrific piece of meat! Perfectly cooked in spite of me ordering 'medium rare' (as it usually comes medium). the rest of the 5 course menu was perfect too, no complaints whatsoever.What makes it a really expensive experience are the drinks...but thats quite normal in Singapore. And lets be honest, if you choose to go to a fancy restaurant like that, you can't complain about that!All in all, a great experience, perfectly prepared food, albeit with steep prices! Will definitely go back on a "normal day" and try √É¬† la carte. The ambience is great and the staff does their utmost to make you feel comfortable
4
Steak was great! Attentive staff, cosy and nice restaurant with fantastic ambience.
Good place to celebrate anniversary and birthdays, be it for couples or with family.
5
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the restaurant. The food was excellent, and the service top-notch. Will definitely go again

1. Reserved table for birthday celebration a week in advance but they gave a table just besides the kitchen, terrible location. 2. Forget to serve the complimentary bread, until we asked after our appetiser alr arrived. 3. Servers couldn't see us maybe due to poor location or short served, had to keep our hands raised for prolonged period of time4. Pre ordered cake to be served after meal but they forgot, I had to go and ask them to serve them which defeats purpose of surprising my hubby with birthday cake5. Disappointed that birthday cake wasn't complimentary. Compared to morton's which had good seats, complimentary birthday cake, Wooloomooloo paled in comparison for a bd celebration
2
This is my fourth visit to the restaurant and the service and food were still excellent except for the quality of the steak, which have deteriorated. The crust on the steak was poorly done and rubbery. For amount paid, I think there are better alternatives around
4
The food was lovely. Service and ambience was pretty good too.Overall, an enjoyable evening for all
3
Steak was good but definitely not a 12oz steak. The steak at best was 9-10oz so I feel cheated. Taste and quality was good. Lamb shanks portion was too small too. Over priced food. Better steak else where.
4
I found the portions quite big, so I'd highly recommend Filet mignon for small eaters and the Ribeye for larger eaters. The ribeye steak was fattier and juicier while the filet mignon was lean.Medium well doneness was slightly disappointing as the steak got a little dry but the medium rare doneness was perfect! HIGHLY recommend their mashed potatoes - cannot describe how smooth it was. Never had any like this one before!Bread and butter pudding was pretty special too! Their chocolate lava cake was really rich, and the rum taste was very strong. They were a little understaffed on a friday night so the service wasn't as good as I expected. A good experience at wooloomooloo overall - great for special occasions

My first review somehow got deleted. I had such a bad time at this place that I am adamant that this review be posted up. I went with friends on a Sunday and was forced to have the brunch menu. The brunch menu has limited options and has one steak option. First up, the eggs Benedict came stone cold. When we asked the waiter about it, he confirmed that the dish was supposed to be cold. Really now, cold eggs? Over some ordinary bread and not even toasted or fresh? It could have been sitting on the kitchen table the whole day and it definitely tasted like it had. The server was not very helpful and did not even try to make things better, even though there were only a few occupied tables that day. The mushroom soup was not bad, had some decent truffle flavour in it although I did not think the cheese shavings were necessary. The salad was doused in olive oil. Not much to say about oily salad but I was not impressed. For the mains I ordered the chicken shepherd's pie, which was chicken ragu topped with mash. The mash was all right, but the ragu was overly salty. I did not finish the pie. Such a shame as I love a good pie. My friends ordered the steak, and here I thought we would at least be satisfied as steak is the main star of the restaurant. We were so very wrong. My friend left his steak unfinished, the texture did not look right therefore the cook on it was poorly executed. Additionally, the crust on the steak was not done well so the steak looked bland and unappetizing. For dessert, I ordered the cheese board while my friends ordered the raspberry meringue. The meringue was an assault of sugar. Nothing else to it, just pure sugar. My cheese board was a shock to me. How does one mess up a cheese board, it is beyond me. The cheese was stale and lacked any flavour and the crackers tasted like cardboard. They must have left the cheese and crackers out for a long time for it to have such little flavour or texture in any of the cheeses and crackers. Even the walnuts tasted stale. Quince jam, which is a favourite of mine, just tasted like a sweetish paste and lacked all the depth and flavour of a proper quince jam. It was our first visit there, and I think I'll never go back. It was such a disappointment as I had heard good things about this place
5
I would like to say it's one of best steak in Singapore. And staff provided prof service with smiling. The temperature of the steak is just nice and juicy. I will come back again for sure.
4
Read the online reviews and true to it, the place offered friendly services and very good huge steaks. Their service is wonderful, as the portion is quite huge, the waiter is able to recommend something smaller off the menu. Cosy ambience but noisy due to the of people around for dinner on a Fri night. Our food were served promptly, medium done as requested, with a nice crust on the outside. Will be back again for sure
5
Food was great. Service was good. Though they served me desserts without asking what we wanted.. service recovery was prompt but we declined as we were really too full..
5
We had beef Wellington and it was very good! The atmosphere was very nice for both couples and family
2
Doing this review live as we wait for our course. Good Ambience and food but the service is a let down. Awaiting for avg. 15- 20 Minutes between course. Not that attentive on a Friday's nite. Load of kids too. So avoid if you want a romantic dinner
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse. Have enjoyed the brunch in a nice atmosphere and great service.
5
Excellent service. Exquisite lunch. My wife and I was very full even before dessert! Will come again next tim
5
Go for set lunch during weekdays. Very worth it!Ambience is good. 2nd time here. I made reservation before going down. First time was hosted by business associates. Staffs are friendly.
5
Awesome value for money. Food was good. Ambience was good. Service was good. All round nice experience.
5
We had a wonderful6 coursed meal which was tasty and priced reasonably. Service was excellent and attentive. What a great countdown we had
4
The steaks are value for money. However the steaks are slightly overdone. Medium rare was more like medium. Still tasty though. A little short of staff when it was crowded. Otherwise, it was a pleasant visi
5
Husband and I came here for Xmas eve dinner. As in pregnant, the staff were extremely accommodating to my dietary needs and even when over and beyond what I had requested for, to make further suggestions for me to consider. I was highly impressed by the service. Food as always was delicious (although slightly salty), ambience fantastic. Always a place I'll consider for special occasions!
5
A very friendly crew and they have very good recommendation. Crew pay very good attention to us, therefore food is service otd.
3
I sent in my SAF on Saturday morning thinking that my request will be fulfilled on Sunday afternoon. When we arrived, I asked about my special request, the staff told me that they know about it, but I didn't get what I've requested.
2
This restaurant had everything going for it, except the food arrived cold. It was cooked perfectly, but it was cold. The service could have been a little better. Overall, it's a nice place but they need to be more aware of the details
4
The food was good as expected. We ordered 2 side dishes, including a baked potato, When the food was served, we realised that one of the main ordered included half a baked potato. That was too much.... we wished that the staff had told us so, as we would likely then have ordered something else. Eventually that half a baked potato was not eaten, and became a 'wasted food'. I would suggest that all serving staff must be familiarised with each and every dish, especially for mains, and advises customers accordingly
3
Decided to order a la carte instead of the set lunch menu. Had to wait much longer than those ordering the set lunch. Strange that they penalize those not ordering the set lunches. The waiting time was at least 40 minutes. Also, waiters were more interested in serving those having the set lunches than us. Coming to the food, the filet mignon seemed overcooked for a medium. The waiter briefly explained the sauces and went off before we could ask questions. The beef wellington was unique and strong in flavour. For the amount paid, quality of food and service I received, I believe that this is a restaurant that I will not recommend to my friends
5
We had a great fun time @ wooloomooloo steakhouse for our company Christmas dinner.Jack was an amazing host and they planned a nice special menu for us. Mushroom soup was yummy with rich flavor of truffles, loved the crispy pork belly. Steaks were delicious and nicely cooked. Shahfiq and Naz were very friendly. Thank you and we enjoyed a lot :)Christmas decoration of restaurant was lovely
1
Food was fine but service was absurd. Caucasian manager was condecending in checking if we have ordered enough food. He was quick to clear our table even before we finished our sides. Restaurant was not even half filled and his action was uncalled for. I will pay more and pick another restaurant any day for better service that is diner focussed. I'll never dine here with my guest again. Utter disgust ....over absurd service
3
I have been going to Wooloomooloo for all my special occassions for a couple of years already. The standard of the staff have decline. Most of the older team had left, except for Jack who is the manager there. He is still very good. Note: there is no more complimentary photo for your special occassion. My husband was looking forward to it because it had been a tradition and collection as we went there every year for our anniversary. He was so disappointed.One of the lady staff was quite rude too But jack was sensitive enough to change a new server for us. Will we go back for our anniversary again? Probably not
4
When I am in Singapore, I often make a trip to WoolooMooloo. The service is top notch, easy to get to (just hop off at the City Hall MRT), brilliant steaks, staff are very attentive. However it does get busy at times especially during dinner. This is where the level of service sometimes drops, and where it needs to improve. Jack, has done a great job transforming it into a vibrant and warm steak house and still has a way to go. I personally like to sit at the high table near the bar. Steak, drinks and good company

I have been to Wooloomoolo at the Stamford Swisshotel a fair number of times over the past four years, as a couple, for business and also for rowdy girls' nights and have almost always had a very positive experience. However, its just fallen off the list of my 'go to' steak places. On my last but one visit, I had to send my streak back as it was completely undercooked and when it came back, the same piece of meat was charred black and tasted bitter. Everyone else had almost finished by that time so I didn't make a fuss. No apology though. Ok, so I forgave them on the back of previous good experiences -anyone can have a bad day. This Saturday, after a gruelling few weeks at work, my husband took me and my son there for dinner as a treat. I was in a good mood and excited by the prospect of a night out at a plush venue. Location looked v festive, seated at just after 7.30pm. The restaurant was only half full. We had to wait absolutely ages for our meal. Starters were late but the mains took at least 30 mins from the time we finished starters. I had ordered the fillet cooked to medium. Easy peasy. It came, I cut into it and it was blue (not even rare). Completely raw inside. The waitress took my plate away without saying anything other than "yes it is" when I pointed out it was undercooked. The nothing.... ten mins later I chased progress, ten mins later same piece of meat returns. The Cut bite size portion was charred black. I cut into the big piece. Still blue! The waiter agrees and goes off to get me a new one. By this time I'm losing hope and my appetite deserts me.. Ten mins later. I chase again for progress. I wait some more. Husband has finished mains. My sides - mash and my fave creamy spinach are cold and congealed. Finally a steak arrives, properly cooked and hot. Yaay! But they did not replace my sides but gave me mushrooms (unasked for and unliked). Overall, the evening was ruined. Yes I did eat finally but by that time, the restaurant was EMPTY, I kid you not. It was a lonely meal. The waiter apologised but really, how can you get steak so wrong in a steak restaurant??. Doesn't the chef check what goes out of his kitchen? Why aren't staff trained in customer care? Its a poor effort when I have to chase my own food. They did take my steak off the bill without my having to ask but they sucked the joy out of the evening with poor cooking and poor service management. I'm done with Wooloomooloo .

Hubby andI shared a 12oz ribeye. It was cooked to perfection. Creamy corn side was superb and four gra just melted in your mouth. The complimentary bread was so soft it was dreamy
5
After a year of Long wait the weekend brunch is back! This is so far the best steak Will keep me wanted to go back! Only setback is the steak I will prefer the old menu but the rest is excellent !
4
Nice ambient, cozy lighting, noise level in the restaurant to the busy side. The Waiter is very attentive and polite and knowledgeable on the products when asked for recommendation on the main course.Starter bread is nice and warm with salted butter however the starter that I ordered is the Jumbo prawn cocktail. Prawns are over done to my liking. Sauce is nice, zesty n refreshingWaiter very attentive and clear our table after we finished our starter in ard 10mins, iced water is refilled accordingly. Service is good in my opinion. For the main we ordered: Aus Filet Mignon, cooked perfectly to my liking of medium rare. Superb cut, loves the sauces provided. (There are 4 types of sauces given, my best liking is the mushroom sauce). Beef Wellington is acceptable but abit to the rare side when we ordered to be medium, puff pastry is delicious and meat is well seasoned. Pricing to me for the quality of the steak and the service is reasonable. Total we spent at: $160++Will definitely come back again
5
Christine at the Ritz Carlton Club recommended this restaurant and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted and superbly looked after by the restaurant general manager, who treated us very well. The food was fantastic which backed up the great service. Steaks were cooked to perfection and side dishes were beautifully cooked. Honestly I felt the food was better than Cut by Wolfgang Puck and 25% cheaper. Outstanding and faultless thanks guys.

Came for dinner at Wooloomooloo on Tuesday night, very suprised to see a beautiful chirstmas tree strewn with wrapped girfts and boxes nad bags. Had a drink in the bar which was covered in fairy iights and then dinner in the restauarnt, again more christmas decorations, there were lovely red flowers on the tables. The restaurant felt very festive with the ocasional christmas song playing in the background. I love christmas but personaly feel that it is to early to do this kind of decorations. But it seems to be the norm these days, traiditionaly on the 1st December please. This is only reason why 4 star rating. Food and service was excelent
4
We had beef Wellington which was sublime. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The table next to us were rather loud though but it's no fault of the restaurant. Service at the bar could be better. Perhaps it was ladies night and an almost full bar; my martini order has to be reminded 3x. Other than that small blip, everything was near to perfection. We will return soon! Thank you
5
We came with high expectations and Wooloomooloo did not disappoint. The waiter Darrell recommended my to try the new sirlion. It was the most juicy, ordered medium and came out pink. The fat nicely caramelised. We ordered a bottle of Malbec to go with it which paired perfectly. The Restaurnt was busy and the staff were moving fast but still had the time to smile. It took a little time to get the bill but was ok it was busy.
1
It was my dad's birthday and he always was a fan of Wooloomooloo and have always gone there frequently. we had the brunch set menu that day which was a 5 course meal. The service was very slow, I had to repeat my orders 3 times to 3 different people in order to get some warm water. The French Onion soup was too salty, same for the teriyaki salmon and lamb pasta. The worst thing, I would believe was that as we placed an order for a steak, the staff did not bother to even ask about how my father preferred the steak's doneness and it was just served. For dessert, they managed to only serve my parents while my desert only arrived when my parent's finished theirs and mind you, my dessert choice was exactly the same. Things have surely gone downhill
5
~ There for lunch on a Monday noon.~ Good Steak and prompt service as expected.~ Special thanks to the Chinese staff that look after our table, he took initiative to request with their Chef on preparing an off menu spaghetti for my son, it is often a little touches like this that make one remember about the place, when you didn't expected it
4
Went on a Saturday dinner with my hubby. Atmosphere was noisy but cosy. Service was friendly. We ordered half a dozen oysters for starters and they were extremely fresh. Wished they were a tad bigger though for the price. We had a 1.6kg Tomahawk steak, cooked right to medium-rare perfection with a bit of char on the outside. It was tasty and tender. Out of the 4 sauces, our favorites were the mushroom and red wine. The black pepper sauce was a little too overpowering to pair with the steak and the last was au jus gravy if I'm not wrong. We ordered sides of asparagus and spinach with mushrooms. The asparagus was big and surprisingly sweet. Spinach with mushrooms was tasty.With a bottle of red wine, the bill came up to over $500 - a very expensive dinner. I think you could get similar quality food for less at other restaurants with a more romantic and personal setting, but it was worth a try
4
Ordered 2 steak and 2 appetizers ( foie gras and scallops) and 1 side. Love the steak, very nicely done. The foie gras was also very gd.
5
Entire dining experience was great as not only the steak was good, the service from the crew was awesome.
5
Came here with my partner for lunch today and had the weekend brunch menu. We had specific dietary restrictions and the staff were very accommodating and patient. Our steaks were succulent and tender and I enjoyed every part of our meal. 10/10 would return. Thank you so much for the wonderful meal.
3
This is a fine dining steakhouse which has great steaks however be warned the dinner menu is very expensive. We ordered 3 mains plus sides and 3 drinks which cost well over S$280. They have an extensive wine menu however for the price I am not sure it was good value. Recommend if you really want good steaks but be prepared to pay
4
We were there for the restaurant week to discover the place. The special menu made us take a 5 course meal including seafood, prawn perfectly cooked and 120 day grain fed beef ribeye, also very good. Service Could be overwhelmed when the crowd is here. Nevertheless, The food is great! A bit too pricey outside of special menu..
3
Having last visited a couple of years back.I decided on Wooloo when the name popped up as one of the offerings for restaurant week. $40 and you get a great value 3 course set lunch with a free shot of lobster bisque thrown in for good measure as the amuse bouche and it's literally a shot. Having washed down the rich bisque and soaked up the remaining drops with the yummy fresh out of the over bread, the beef cheek cannelloni arrived. It was a hearty portion for a starter which I decided not to overindulge in as I was saving my appetite for the steak. The pasta was a trifle salty I thought; thankfully the steak (best had medium) was better executed. Desserts were average; D and I had the brownie which could have been more dense and chocolaty whilst L had the cheesecake which was hmmm. All in it was a nice lunch though expensive after we added up the $50 corkage and the $9/cup coffees.7/1
4
The food here is amazing. Better than other steak houses restaurants in Singapore. The food prices aren't unreasonable, and the food is always fantastic. The steaks were both very tender and really tasty. Very well presented and nice portions too. Seasoned and cooked to perfection.Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I have been here several times and didn't have a bad meal once. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back
4
Had a table for two facing the F1 track, the steak is great. Even though we couldn't order their famous tomahawk (since the smallest size is more than 1kg...), but we tried the Fillet Mignon and the ribeye, which was perfectly done. We love the fact that they gave us all four sauces to dip our steak in, and we can always top up with the one we preferred, so no wrong choice on sauce that will spoil our meat. However if you really want to, come in a bigger group so you can get your hands on the tomahawk... Service is good generally, attentive.
4
Good place, great staff, food was good and average. I was with my young kids, we had a great time, we shared a steak, which was supposed to be medium rare, but came medium well. My onion soup was a disaster - too cold, served in the wrong dish, not enough cheese to top it. My souffle Grand Marnier was delicious, a success. So, what did I like there? The staff! Great people, gentle, smiling, willing to help. That makes all the difference to me
5
Managed to get a last minute reservation here. Great views from the restaurant of Marina Bay Sands lit up in the evening. Great place for a romantic evening. Staff very attentive and knowledgeable about their products.As I knew the main course was going to be big we opted to miss the starters and just order a main course with the hope of having a dessert.Ordered a Rib Eye and a Fillet Mignon, creamed spinach, saut√©ed mushrooms and baked potato.The idea is that you order the steak of your choice which is one price and then add sides which are priced individually. We found that we could have actually ordered less. One baked potato between two people would be plenty as the potato's are huge.Whilst we were waiting for the steaks to arrive the staff took our order for wine and bought us a wooden plank of warm onion bread to eat. The bread was gorgeous.Steaks arrived, both perfect, sides and a selection of warm sauces are left on the table so you can try every sauce with your meal. (peppercorn, madeira, mushroom and jus)To my disgust I was so full from the main meal that I couldn't manage to try the desserts, although looking around the room they looked scrumptious.This is an expensive restaurant, the steaks cost around $SG90 each and the sides are $SG15 each, wine by the bottle starts around $SG150 upwards. that said the food was excellent and enjoyed it immensely
5
Food was great ! The steak is just right and chocolate dessert is out of this world. However the serving time could be improved.
5
We popped in for a Drink and Stayed for Dinner after a few Early Evening Lichee Martinis. The Welcome, Ambience and Food were All Above Standard and a lovely Location if not so Easy to Find in Raffles City above Swissotel on 3rd Floor.
5
The food was really tasty, and every dish definitely met, if not exceeded, our expectations, the price is also pretty reasonable for a restaurant of such quality, the staff were very helpful and made our dining experience a very pleasant one,
5
Was there to celebrate my birthday with my wife and order the set meal. The service staff is attentive and always check on us to make sure that the food is good and we are comfortable. Would return there again for dinning.
5
It was good food and good value as they had SG 51 promotional menu at a special price. Wine is expensive though.
3
For the price we paid and for the standard of the place, the steak was disappointing. I had a sirloin dried aged from Australia. It came not warm enough, with veins making it shewy. I asked for medium rare and i got rare, had to send it back to the kitchen. Side dishes were alright and the sauces as well. Thanks the Lord there was dessert and that saved the bet. Cheese cake and chocolate cake were heavenly.Super friendly service though, waiters apologized for the mistake and have been very nice.

Visited wooloomooloo for the first time, after making a reservation via chope to try out their chope 5-course set menu. It was $69 per pax and even though this was probably way cheaper than the ala-carte price, the service that we received was impeccable. The server was friendly, gave us a good wine recommendation and even joked with us. The star of the meal - the angus steak - was perfectly cooked. Although it was slightly fatty, but overall, we enjoyed the meal very much. Would definitely be back there again. Oh yes, the restaurant offers a very nice view towards the Padang are, so do indicate your preference for a window table if you're there for a date!

Value for money, executive set lunch selection Monday-Friday. Three-course sets range $36-$40++. $36 (main dish pasta), some set offer steak as the main dish. Lunch menu ends 230 pm so reservation is needed. Highly recommended for business lunch as restaurant is classy and service top-notch - 1st time, we experienced server asking how we like the salmon to be done..soft pink, or well done! Bravo

Honestly, I came with my partner with the intention to have some awesome beef, but to my horror, it is really quite the opposite. Service was acceptable but staff training for an establishment like theirs is still far from acceptable. Firstly we ordered medium-rare, but the steak came medium-well, souffle collapsed upon serving to the table. Coming from a culinary background, I am pretty sure a souffle is not supposed to collapse, secondly coming from a service provider, a mere sorry is not going to cut it out especially for a restaurant of their standard. Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. Meal was 370 and it is the worst experience I have ever had. No one should ever have to put up with it

I brought my partner for his birthday dinner at Wooloomooloo and that evening after dinner, we both suffered severe food poisoning which made us both throw up violently throughout the night. Upon calling the restaurant the next day to complain, the GM of the restaurant claimed that all the correct measures were taken in the food preparation and not once did he take any responsibility for the cause of the incident. To instead add insult to injury, we were offered a meal back at the restaurant. Not once did he offer any other compensation nor a refund. Not only did I pay a huge amount for the meal, fallen ill and had it ruin my partners' birthday and the entire day to follow, and subsequently lost a day at work, we would never willingly step foot into that restaurant again. For the amount that was paid, I'd recommend to go to other steak houses where you won't get ill from your meal, or at least get a restaurant that is willing to take responsibility when something goes wrong

I went wooloomooloo stakehouse for lunch with my family.
All of my family members satisfied with Service and food.
Quite expensive but worthy.
I highly recommend this place for an important business meeting or anniversary.
4
The atmosphere is great for a business dinner, which I planned to welcome several of my overseas guest. The colonial house is the attraction, as well as the front yard.
service staff are attentive and friendly, as well as flexible in meeting our needs.
4
Everything was good , except the table was a bit too small for us esp since we ordered two appetizers with two mains plus two side dishes. On top of that, a bottle of red wine. Overall, quite enjoyable experience there.
5
The waiter and waitress are all very professional-looking and rich in knowledge. They are very polite and friendly!
Whole dining experience was awesome! From the service, to the food. Excellent! :D

First time dining at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse. Tried the filet mignon (medium well) and it was delectable. It was served with four different sauces which all went well with the filet mignon. Truffle fries were served in a sizable portion.
4
Somewhat informal, which was nice; a little noisy (one particular table); expensive (of course!) - but the Wagyu stake was really good, served with a selection of sauces. For some odd reason, the waiter knelt by my side and informed me of the cost of the portions without my asking (they are priced by weight) - I wondered if I was not dressed to his satisfaction..
2
Foie gras is my must have started, when served, was burnt the first round, 2nd round same issue but the manager-in-charge was honest enough to announce that before the plate arrive. The next best he recommended was crab cake. Frankly, we thought the searing of the crab cake was also towards almost burnt. We accepted it out of courtesy. Taste wise was just ok, not WOW. For main course, we ordered the best in the menu, 2 USDA Ribeye, we asked for medium rare and medium rare plus however, not many people understand what medium rare plus means. That's ok. When arrived, the meat doneness were well done. Because the quality of the meat was tender and juicy, the chef was safe for that matter. For the sides, we ordered sauteed spinach & mushroom but overly oily and salty, Manager-in-charge, Jack, was caring and attentive, he make it up by pouring us complimentary champagne, that's nice gesture. The point is, why would chef served burnt fine food. If they think customer is dumb, please think again. We spent $600 for 2. Overall experience, Food wise - really nice warm bread, food taste and plating mediocre. Service wise - good
3
the food is pricey but they are of good quality. my family really enjoyed their meal no doubt it came with a big price tag. the complimentary bread given was really tasty too. service wise. it felt intrusive yet lacking at the same time. we had 2 staffs approach us with menus when half the group first sat. then when the other half of the group arrived, there was no one around to offer them menus. then 10mins later we had 3 staffs ask if we needed help with the menus, all one after another (with a 5mins interval inbetween at most). it was often difficult to get someone's attention for service and even a refill of iced water had to be requested as no one refilled our glasses even though it was completely empty. I would return for a fancy meal. but service could be better.
4
First time trying this restaurant! I would say this place has great view which we were able to see the skyline of Singapore plus Marina Bay Sands. We ordered truffled Mac & Cheese, Medium USA Ribeye and Medium well tenderloin! The Mac & Cheese was amazingly good!!! This was one of the best that I ever had :) As for the steak, it was not bad. They also supplied 4 types of sauces which I thought was great!
3
Recently dined here for dinner - my steak was a filet minion and it despite being undercooked to medium as I requested, it was still very nice. My partner ordered a sirloin, cooked to medium. His steak was over cooked, more like medium well done. The sides that we ordered were nice enough, though if I have one complaint - all of the food was under-seasoned. Just a little salt really elevated the whole meal. My only other gripe with this restaurant is the price of the wine. I know Singapore is expensive for wine, but $100+ for average bottles of wine...just feels way too over priced for what it actually is. Over all we enjoyed our meal, but not sure we will return at $400 for two people for steaks that weren't cooked correctly and sides that were both under-seasoned. When you're paying that kind of money for one single meal you expect to not have to deal with things like sending food back because your steak isn't cooked correctly, or having to wait for a waiter to ask for salt as there was none on the table. I still enjoyed the meal, but a shame that it wasn't what it could have been.
4
Having been to the Wooloomooloo in Hong Kong many times, we knew what to expect and we weren't disappointed. The meat and food was great as usual. Service was a bit slow but it didn't ruin our experience.
3
Not a bad experience ! Steak was slightly tough and could have been of better quality. Side dishes were tiny but substantial for small eaters . Wild mushrooms was bitter ! Ambience was great tough ...
5
Excellent service and food. A bit pricey, but it was worth it. When we made a rather innocuous comment about the food, the manager immediately offered to exchange it.
5
I am a big steak fan so it was highly likely that this would be my type of meal, however I was expecting it to be quite so good.Every aspect was first class but the food and service were impeccable. Next venue and view was outstanding - I will be back.My steak was cooked exactly as requested and the sides were generous and tasty
5
We went there on our anniversary with the hope of having good food and lovely ambience. We indeed got both :) Service: On arrival we were shown to our seats where little heart confetti was sprinkled on the table. Nice little touch there :) Service was good without being too imposing. Help staff were all polite and accommodating. Thank u! Food:Starter of Jumbo Crab Cake looked small but do not overestimate how filling it was. Nicely pan-fried with fresh Crab lumps. YUMMY!!! The free bread they served was to die for. I've eaten freshly baked and best breads from around the world and this one can definitely match their standards!!! It was soft and fluffy with a nice hint of cheese. Yums!!! Mains:Filet mignon and chargrilled filet mignon salad were both very nicely done. My partner enjoyed his beef very very much. It was soft and tender and juicy on the inside, and a very good size too. My salad was crisp and savoury. Compliments to the chef!! Total bill: $158Well worth it :) We've had a good meal there. Thank u for making dining there such a memorable experience for us =)

Ordered a wagyu 12oz, medium. This time they have promo price at $70. Very nicely done n tasty. Have always return once a year n Wooloomooloo never disappoint. Very good service and always come with 4 common steak sauces and another set of specialty (mustards). Tried the wooloomooloo in Hong Kong. Standard is excellent n comparable.

Saw teh good reviews and wanted to try while i was staying in the Fairmont, its not that far from the hotel in Raffles city shopping center. I came here for lunch and ordered the fixed menu. I have to admit it was lovely, fresh ingredients and almost star level prepared. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Price was normal for this kind of restaurant, worth a visit
3
We went to this place for dinner a week ago. As usual that I forgot to review after went to many places and this one was the missedThe steak was quite good as the same as last time we were here. The salmon was alright. The service inside was decent. Specifically those two young gentlemen in the front were really friendly. My cocktails price was overcharging for 3++. The billing system here wasn't accurate. If you come here as a group and order several glass of cocktails Watch out on your bill.. 3++ for many glass would cost quite a bit of money. Lower floor, and reflection at night made this place only suitable for business dinner /Not suitable for romantic dinner.
5
Had dinner at Wooloomooloo for my birthday and was taken care of by Jack. As usual perfection, it is still one of my favourite restaurants. When I went on line to post this review I saw Hsiao's review. It is so sad to see the way people behave these days, some people's opinions should really not matter. She said this has happened to her in previous dining experiences, wonder whether she is the problem or the restaurant
5
Had a craving for steak after being cholesterol-conscious for a while, and we decided to check out Wooloomooloo after looking at online reviews. The maitre d recommended the wagyu and it was lovely! We had it medium-rare and it was so juicy that it didn't need any of the 4 sauces that came with it. Service was excellent - we were very well-looked after and the onion bread that came at the start - yummmmmm - regretted eating so much of it when the steak came. Portions were pretty sizeable for us but it went down surprisingly fast...=)
4
Steaks are made with perfection. Great friendly staff who have been attending to us checking on the food. Overall an wholesome experience..will definitely recommend to all steak-lovers out there
5
The steak here is fantastic. Grilled to perfection - sufficiently burnt while maintaining the juiciness of the meat. The waiters here are friendly and helpful. And the view here is unique. Will definitely visit again.
4
We went here for a work function. Big group but were served quite well. Food cam out relatively fast and someone always topping up or taking drink orders. Food generally ok but nothing special, the steaks were very good.
5
had dinner here last night the restaurant was very quiet but was looked after very well by the malay waiter. He recommended the USDA Prime rib eye and it did not disappoint. The steak was jury caramelised and came with a side of creamy spinach. The only downside was that it was too warm for my liking but nothing a cold beer could not fix. Although pricey it was worth the buc
5
Went with the hubby for my bday dinner . To start the meal, was a beautiful onion bread which was soft and yums! We orderedDuck liver with Apple compote This was well executed ! Buttery liver with mix of sourish sweetish Apple compote . Great balance Mains Potter house steak ( Aussie) with sides of kipfler potatoes, onions and spinach and mushroom . The steak was well prepared. Quality is definitely there . Melt on the mouth meat . Just perfect ! In my opinion , the sauces given was not needed as the steak was able to hold on it's own! Dessert was cheesecake I think also delightful! Service was attentive and the attention to details was a cherry on TOP of the cake hence summing up a beautiful experience .Cheers guys !
5
1st time back for a year or so. The atmosphere was just the same, service was warm and friendly. I met Lawrence Who looked after me very well he was very knowledgeable Bout the food his recommendation of the special of the day was the highlight, cooked to perfection. As I was leaving i was recognised by another staff and offered a welcome back night cap. Will be bac

My wife had the Rib Eye and I had the Filet Mignon. Her steak was juicy and done right. Mine was a bit of touch and go - granted it was well done, it was however to a large extent, over done. There were too many charred bits to the steak. I was also disappointed that the Potatoes / Starch and Vegetables are items charged separately - the portions for the sides are rather small for the price they charged. So if they are not to be included, I would prefer if the portions are really big enough for 2 persons. They were not, hence we did not feel like it was a satisfying meal.Quite pleased with the ambience though ‚Äì nice views of the Padang and tall buildings in the CBD, and pleasant surroundings in the restaurant. But for the price you are paying, the chatter from the tables nearby is quite loud.They made the effort to have small 'Happy Birthday" letterings strewn on the dinner table (I told them beforehand it was my wife's birthday) but I also told them I would like a slice of cake - just so as a gesture from me to my wife. They said ok on the phone but on the night, they told me, I have to order a dessert separately and they do not have slices of cake. However, we did not feel like having any of the dessert on the menu. I felt they let us down - they could have said so on the phone and I would have then brought along a small slice of cake. So in the end, no cake and no candle for my wife's birthday dinner...

I have made a reservation online for dinner on 09 May (Monday) to celebrate Mother Day's dinner (2 pax). Requested for a window seat and was glad that they've arranged. The service staffs were attentive and polite. We have ordered:1. Foie Gras ~ SGD34++I personally think that the foie gras served was a pretty big portion and we could not finish it. Taste was average.2. Spinach Ravioli ~ SGD38++The Spinach Ravioli was too salty and we didn't quite enjoy it.3. Tajima Rib Eye (not on menu, can check with staff on the availability) ~ SGD90++ The Tajima Rib Eye was good. It was also served with 4 difference sauces. We were satisfied with the steak and it was recommended by the staff. I would definitely go back for the steak! Good and reasonably priced
4
Cane here to celebrate Mother's Day. Recommended by Son. We ordered 4 steaks, orders were taken with a lot of personal attention. The steaks were done according to our choice and the beef still retains its juices. Portion was enough and the sides were served individually. Prices reasonable to service rendered. Would visit again. Recommend you give it a try
4
Was hankering after some good steak one week night so I made the great choice of heading over to Wooloomooloo. Business was bustling, but the service was prompt. Ordered a jumbo crab cake and ribeye. Crab cake was simple, slightly sweet, but nothing to brag about. Steak on the other hand was a perfect medium rare. It was juicy and tender and so so delicious. Will definitely be back again
4
Upmarket food. A good venue for a business meeting. Staff are attentive and the food quality is good.
4
Excellent and convenient venue. Range in the menu covering the usual suspects. Food well prepared and came to table on time, no waiting but no rushing. Good selection of wines by glass half or full bottles. Well worth a try.
3
My first visit to this place. It is very nicely decorated, designed generates a nice atmosphere. Service is okay, not spectacular. It is located inside of one the typical shopping centers of Singapore called Raffles City.I loved the Tuna starter. Very light and with lots of uncovered flavor. The Steak, I had the Woolomooloo Steak, was very well prepared. However I like the big cuts 1inch thick, this was maybe half (Steak Lover would call it Carpaccio). The sides have also been without any complaint. I would come again, but certainly there are better places for Steaks in that City
5
I went there with my wife and family as a new customer. We were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I ordered one of their signature steaks with Cajun spices. This steak was cooked to perfection at a perfect medium rare. I recommend this place to any steak lover in Singapore
5
The restaurant is located in the corner of Swissotel the Stamford, a hidden gem indeed. We were greeted with smiles upon entering the restaurant and was allocated a window seat facing the beautiful skyline of Singapore's CBD area and Padang. Shortly after, warm onion focaccia bread and butter was served. The bread was warm and buttery. The service staff was very attentive and was quick to respond to our needs. He was very knowledgeable and shared his recommendation while taking our orders. We ordered some appetisers to share, the Lobster Bisque we had was velvety and smooth with chunks of lobster meat in it! We had Foie Gras which was very well-presented, the pairing with apple compote was heavenly. It was the best way to start off a meal! The highlight of the meal will definitely be the main course. We ordered a Wooloomooloo Steak (ribeye steak marinated with Cajun spice), USDA Prime Ribeye and sides of creamy spinach and truffle mac & cheese. The steaks were done to perfection, it was tender and juicy! I love how flavourful the Wooloomooloo Steak was! Four sauces were served with the steaks, red wine sauce, black peppercorn sauce, mushroom sauce and au jus. My favourite would be the black peppercorn sauce, it was smooth and rich, went very well with the USDA Prime Ribeye. Four mustards were also offered, dijon, wholegrain, green peppercorn and french mustard. The sides was also very well-executed. I would recommend to go for the truffle mac and cheese!!! We ended the meal on a high with their signature Wooloomooloo Hot Chocolate cake. The molten chocolate lava was oozing out while we cut into the cake. The texture was simply divine and I was hoping to have it all to myself. I would highly recommend Wooloomooloo Steakhouse to all steak lovers! The food, service and experience was amazing. Thank you to the team at Wooloomooloo for making us feel so special. It was truly a satisfying gastronomical experience. I can't wait to be back for another wonderful meal

We went there for dinner as a family of four. It started all wrong from the first place instance on the phone reservation where I called to make a reservation ahead and was surprised that the receiver on the other side was all too keen to end the call without even ask for my name and my contacts. I had to prompt them to ask....When we arrived, the restaurant was full and when we took our table, the lady that took our order seemed ok although we had to repeat our orders twice... She had an affinity towards lobster soup as the mushroom soup we chose was repeated as lobster...twice..And as my wife wanted salad as a main course with her soup while the rest of us had our steaks...the lady didn't ask if the salad was a main course...this resulted in the salad coming in before the soup....Our side orders with the steak ..hash browns and baked potatoes came in much later after the steaks were served..a good 10-15 mins after...plus the waitress that place the bread on our table spilled our sparkling water and just left quickly without apologizing or saying anything. I had to call another waitress to ask her if she can clean the spill. The good thing is that the other waitress apologized and gave the excuse that they have new staffing that day...No one came to ask us on our meals and if everything was ok... No one came to ask if we wanted desserts after collecting the main course....This restaurant looks classy with nice decor and judging by the prices it charges and marketing itself as a mid to top range steakhouse in Singapore... It has a long way to go in the level of their service they provide....This is the one and last time I will go to patronize this restaurant. Our meal for 4 with a bottle of red came up to Sgd$ 650...

I rarely give a 2 Star Review, but this one warrants it. After having eaten purely local food for three days, I was craving a meat and potato meal. I ordered the 10 oz filet medium, it came out mooing..no big deal, I cut into it and the server noticed that it was too rare as well and we just sent it back to get flopped on the grill. The female server dropped it off in front of me and just walked away without a word. It came back out well done, whatever, I can stomach almost anything. I took one bite and the gaminess of the meat was overwhelming. It was chewy and the marbling had hardened to the point that I could barely chew the single piece. I gave my husband a piece and he just responded, "that's a real shame". I just asked for the check, paid and went to the bar which has a magnificent view. We waited about 10 minutes to place a drink order to wind up the evening, but without a bartender, we were unable to do so. So we went downstairs to the bar at Swisshotel where we are currently enjoying very nice beverages.The male assistant server was very nice and accommodating; however, in sum, drop $300 somewhere else or enjoy the view with drinks at the bar. I'll never eat there again

Went here on New Year's Eve looking for something different having recently had a lot of Asian food.This certainly did the trick.Enjoyed delicious Scallops/Foie Gras for starters and then we both had one of the best Filet Mignon's we have ever had.Cooked to perfection.Nice wine selection which initially we had thought was on the expensive side , but having now completed our tour of the Far East turns out to have been very reasonable compared to many other places.Great choice for a change from Asian with lovely views and helpful staffRecommend

We loved the ambience and service when we had dinner there. The staff, from the foreign manager to the Indian lady who led us to the table, were friendly and polite, and made it a point to check with each diner regarding the meal and drinks.The onion loaf with the butter was nice, but needs to be enhanced with a touch of salt, which raises the taste levels though might be less healthy.My wife had the minestrone soup, which she said was the best dish for her - it was a rich broth, and she wished there was a little more. I went with the salad, which was fresh However, I did not enjoy the tartness of the dressing as well as the sliced walnuts, which tasted a little stale and also bitter. The chicken slices were tasty but dry.We both had the sirlion and asked for it to be medium rare. While a generous portion, when our pieces came, it was clearly overcooked, thus making it a little dry and hard. A little bit of fat/marblng would certainly have helped. In fact, three other tables around us also complained that their beef was overdone. The floor manager did try to make amends by asking to send out new mains, but we declined as we were already more than halfway through the beef by then. The plate also had four chips and three cauliflower flowerettes, which seemed to be an afterthought and needed more flavor.Dessert was vanilla flavoured lemon tart. We liked the sliced strawberries, berries and mango, but the biscuit base was on the hard side, but still enjoyable.The mojito was nicely done and my wife enjoyed the drink very much.All in all, the service levels were high, but were slightly letdown by the food. Considering that the restaurant prides itself on being a steakhouse, the sirloins could have and should have been cooked better to guests' requests

Had lunch at Wooloomooloo steakhouse today with a group of about 13 friends. Having moved from Australia I wanted a taste of home - well cooked, good quality Australian food. Wooloomooloo did not disappoint! Although ok the pricey side, the service was worth it.Staff provided us with onion bread and salted butter - at no extra charge. I didn't have any butter but the bread was delicious. As more people arrived more bread was brought out.I ordered pan fried barramundi with baked potato and a tomato sauce. I asked for my meal to be cooked with no salt and little to no oil and staff were happy to oblige. It was cooked well and deliciously tasty. I had apple crumble for dessert which was also yummy. A friend ordered macaroni and cheese on the side; it was to die for! The staff found out that lunch was a birthday celebration and when desserts came out they brought out a birthday cheesecake dessert for me - on the house. They also took a photo of me with my dessert, printed it, and put it in a cardboard frame for me to take home. None of my friends requested this, it was all Wooloomooloo! It made the whole experience even more special.Staff were also really helpful with splitting the bill between 13 people. A painful job, but one they did willingly. As I was leaving they also thanked me for choosing their restaurant and bringing my friends.Thank you so much Wooloomooloo - your service is one of the best I've experienced in Singapore

Expensive restaurant, food was ok, but service was very poor. To highlight the view and the salads. Think twice if you are planning to go with a group.
5
Best selections of steak for your mouth watering craving and serve with four kind of sauces also you can find the good selection of wines to par with
4
We were here for dinner and found out that this restaurant serving good steak. I like the ambiance n decor too. The service also good.
5
I am a regular and visit at least once a month for any important lunch, dinner or meeting. A central location and always a crowd pleaser for locals and out of town visitors alike. Always consistent with menu and service.
4
This restaurant is located at the right spot in Raffle city which makes its atmosphere & all-around views are quite fantastic. The quality of food is excellent. However, I would personally think that the overall prices (especially wine) are too expensive (like triple of the market average).
5
Came back to Wooloomooloo as a normal guest after having held a function here in November 2015. As impressed as I was with how they handled our function, I have even elevated my appreciation of this fine establishment as a dining venue.There are a few things you look for in order to give top marks and they are all here.The service is sincere and attentive while maintaining respect and it is clear they have an understanding of their diners and the menu - extremely professional.The food is fantastic and consistent. Good selection with some speciality plates - the Tomahawk Steak for meat lovers is a must!The wine list is expansive and reasonably priced which is always a winner with me. Something for every budget and taste.The ambience is ideal, with a cosy feel, an adequate level of privacy thanks to the log partitions and great backing music - very retro cool with classics of a bygone era that put a smile on my face. Not very noisy so easy to hold a conversation which I enjoy.Topping it off is a surprisingly good view as you look over the Padang to the skyscrapers of Raffles and the Marina Bay Sands "cricket stumps".Very hard to fault and highly recommend this for a romantic dinner or for a group of friends.You can tell that a lot of care and attention goes into the success of this restaurant and it is a joy to visit. Look forward to my return

This restaurant is located at Swissotel Hotel. It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very busy and we managed to get a table by the window, where I got a great view towards the Padang and the Singapore Skyline!They have a set lunch menu available and we went for it.Here are the highlights of the meal:- Onion bread: A whole loaf of bread was served atop a wooden plate to start. The bread was warm and you break off a piece and spread some butter with it. Best eaten while its warm!- For the first course, I had the Thai salad. It was interesting to see this on the set lunch menu of a Steakhouse and I had to try it. Nice tangy sauce. The fresh prawn was a good complement! - Australian Grass-fed Filet Mignon. Asked for it to be done medium-rare and its indeed done medium-rare! Came with a side of truffle fries with shaven parmesan cheese, watercress greens and mushroom sauce. The server comes around with a little tray of 4 types of mustard. Opted for full grain dijon mustard and dijon mustard.- Dessert - Coconut Panna Cotta, with fresh berries and mango. Coconut flavour of the panna cotta was light.A great lunch and recommended for the beef and do try to get a table by the window to also enjoy the views
5
While looking for a great food source this was a recommendation from a mother meat lover and it did not disappoint. I loved it in every aspect. The food was very good and they did not fail to deliver. One of the steak was not to our liking medium instead of medium rare they promptly prepared a new one with out hesitation.The star is very attentive and know exactly what is in the menu.I liked it and would recommend it without hesitation
5
Decided to celebrate NYE at this restaurant. Overall, a great experience. Perhaps they were rushing slightly for the service that night (they forgot to decorate my table, which I normally request), and the bread came slightly soggy. But still, one of my favourite restaruants for any occasion - be it causal or formal
4
Just discovered this place during a group dinner. Nice atmosphere, professional service, even if a bit long, which is to be expected in most Western restaurants. I ordered the Wooloomooloo steak and was not disappointed, however the cooking was a bit overdone. For a very demanding steak expert, it might have been a big issue, but it was still ok for me. Desserts were nice, nothing extraordinary and portions were generous. Beware of the chocolate dessert after a big steak! Overall, a bit pricy for a personal dinner, if you are just looking for a good steak
5
I ordered the Wooloomooloo signature steak, which is one of the best steaks I have tasted in Singapore. It is great by itself even without the four sauces accompanied with it. The ambience is great, especially with the window view of the city.
5
Steak - so good like always! Executive set lunch is very valuable for money. Good for business and gathering with friends for the most special occasion!
4
Usually go for dinner, but tried the set lunch and it was great value for money. I had the steak and it was a good piece
3
We ordered from the set dinner menu. Most of us had the Sirloin steak. They asked how we wanted our steak done but they don't understand what is 'Medium'. All our orders came out as Well Done. Wasted!Minestrone soup was goodBest was the dessert - vanilla custard tart with mangoes and strawberries Staff were polite but not attentive enough
1
I guess most of the regular staff was on leave. The service that we received was abysmal. Made early reservation for Xmas eve and was informed that no regular menu will be available. Was asked to confirm my acceptance via credit card guarantee. On that night it seemed everyone around us allowed to order from regular menu except us. In addition, the Xmas eve menu provided to me via email included coffee/tea but the waiter said it was a wrong menu and refused to fulfill it. It was just a miserable couple of cups of coffee and tea for a $372 meal for crying out loud. The waiter also offered to show us the "new menu" to prove that we were not entitled to the coffee/tea and that "Celeste must have sent you the wrong menu". We then requested for the bill but it took them 30 minutes to provide that to us (only after a second request). The restaurant was not even full. No surprise given the awful staff members they have hired.

Dinner with my daughter and the second time visiting Wooloomooloo. Tonight was a set menu but was impressed with Jack who accommodated changes to the menu to suit my daughters pallet. Thanks JackThe set menu was was interesting but there were some concerns. The bread for the bruschetta tasted old, the the temperature for some of the dishes was less than desired especially the ravioli. I will certainly enjoy going back and choosing from the menu.

We went to this restaurant for a family dinner. I reserved a table for 5 a week in advance on the restaurant's website. It was easy and the restaurant personnel return my email to confirm my reservation. You have to be prepared to pay for a meal in this restaurant: we had still water (S$40), onion soup (S$21); lobster bisque (S$28, which has a large piece of lobster), In the end, we ordered a Tomahawk rib eye (1.6kg - for sharing), and 2 sides- creamed spinach & sauteed mushrooms.They are tasty and the service is good.

The Wooloomooloo Steakhouse Restaurant is nestled in a corner on the 3rd floor in Swissotel Stamford, just after O' Coffee Club. You will need to walk past the coffee club and to the end to see the entrance to the restaurant.This fine dining restaurant is relatively large and has full length windows with views of the city street.We were served by a polite gentleman named Lawrence, who gave us recommendation and information about items that were not on the menu. Service was very prompt and efficient.There have an extensive wine list with many variants to choose from, whether as a single glass, bottle and for some, half bottle servings.Freshly baked bread sprinkled onions strips and a side of butter was served almost immediately after our orders were made. Additional servings of bread can be requested.We were recommended the Australian tomahawk steak which we requested to be done medium rare. At 1.6kg,it was more than enough for the 2 adults and 2 young boys.For starters, we had foie gras which was well presented and very well made. It tasted really nice and had the same "melt in your mouth" sensation we had expected.The steak itself was a sight to behold when served and it was sliced for us for easy serving.The steak despite its size, was done very perfectly. It was very soft, tender and juicy. The steak is served with four different kinds of sauce to suite various palate. My favorite was the peppercorn sauce which tasted very fresh. In the mouth, one could taste the smooth velvety texture of the steak and very interestingly it doesn't seem to be as filling as one will usually get when eating steaks. The sides of mushrooms and baked potatoes that we ordered were very well made too.It was a very enjoyable dining experience for both adults and kids.Lastly the Shiraz which we paired our food with, was just perfect!The tomahawk was priced at approximately $16 per 100g. Waygu can be had at approximately $22 per 100g

To celebrate our company's 20th year of operations we went seeking an appropriate venue that could accommodate a large crowd of 300, which in Singapore wasn't an easy process.When Wooloomooloo came to mind, we reached out and they were fantastic to deal with from the quick response to our query, sensible on pricing, accommodating to our requirements and made the entire planning stage very comfortable and convenient.I was appropriately kept informed of any items leading up to the event and on the day they were extremely professional.The actual evening could not have gone any better.The set up was exactly as planned, their team members were very welcoming and throughout the entire event the service standards were of the highest order.The quality and options of the food was top shelf and every dietary requirement was easily catered for. The staff and management were extremely helpful when we needed to increase the food (due to my under ordering) and handled it with a no fuss attitude.The venue itself was first class and being in zones suited the big crowd as it still felt very personal and cosy.I would highly recommend the venue and team at Wooloomooloo to anyone needing and event and extend a very big thank you to the entire team for their efforts in making our event such a success

Jack, the manager was especially friendly and attentive. He was always reminding his staff to top up water for guests and was such a pleasure to speak with! His knowledge on how the steak and foie gras was being cooked is impeccable! Me and my partner absolutely felt comfortable and the steak was executed to perfection. We will definitely come back again!

Went last October for wedding anniversary. I asked them to organize Champagne which they did. Food was great, service a bit slow but the restaurant was busy
Will definitively come back!

Had the restaurant week menu and had the best ribeye in a very long time. Just the right portion, cooking was perfect and the sauce excellent.
A special call out to Noel for his amazing service. So attentive to our every need.

food (beef wellington and wooloomooloo steak) was great and the service by Jack (general manager) was incredible. Nothing to pick about
3
Wooloomooloo Steakhouse serves a good decent steak - lives up to the expectation of a good steakhouse. Starters include the classics of cesear salad, crab cakes, steak tartare, etc. Main dishes are heavy on beef, as one would expect - very few other choices - non-beef eaters be advised. Relative to other steakhouses visited in Sing I would say this ranks average - to elaborate: good steaks of average size, average atmosphere, no wow factor such as we found at Cut

Coming back to dine in Woolloomooloo (Singapore) is like coming home. After many months of traversing the globe for work, all I need is my comfortable food of a perfectly executed steak in what I considered one of the most reliable stalwart in the local dining scene.The moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted with smiles all around and the general manager, Jack Fraser walked over to shake our hands warmly and welcome us back. Jack has recognized us from our previous visits and has been the perfect host ever since we first dine in the early days when the restaurant first opened. He possesses the sublime quality to make you feel like both a VIP and a friend all at once, with his genuine mannerism and good engagement. As always, the food was is a treat.I started off with the Smoked Tasmanian Salmon with a melange of ruby grapefruit, radish, fennel, watercress and avocado cream. The Chef does wonders with the perfect combination of different tastes and texture that balance off finelyThe main course of 10 once grass fed Australian Angus Beef fillet mignon centre cut from Warrnambool Victoria is still my favourite steak in town. Tender, juicy with no trace of grease (which is what I noticed during my experience is other brand names steakhouse both overseas and locally). There are many permutations of mustard and much sauce to go with the steak. My choice of the whole-grained mustard and peppercorn sauce makes the meal even more moreish.The Perrier-Jou√É¬´t served to us has the right finesse with a fruity undertone and goes perfectly with the steak.I ended off with the delicious bread and butter pudding with homemade praline & classic vanilla gelato. Simply divine and what a great way to complete what would be a truly satisfying gastronomical experienceWhat makes Woolooomooloo worth going back to time and again is the consistency of the food and especially the kind of service you get from Jack and the team. Well done indeed

If you like steak then the Wooloomooloo Steakhouse is well worth visiting, particularly if you are staying at the Swissotel. Just between the hotel and the shopping centre, once entered you could be in a steakhouse in the States or in South America. The restaurant is dark wood panelled, so better in the evening than in the day time. It feels very cosy. They have a good choice of steaks both from Australia and from the States. They describe exactly where the steaks come from and how they are treated to maximise the value. There is a good range of cuts and sizes and certainly the Australian steaks that I and my colleagues ate were very tasty. There was a good range of starters and desserts. I had a particularly good creme brule. We drank Australian shiraz, but there was a comprehensive wine list. Having this meal before getting onto a long haul flight back to Europe it was the perfect way to end my trip to Singapore and I probably haven't slept as well and contented on any long haul flight before! Certainly worth going to if you like a good steak

Ordered the french onion soup, foei gras, wooloomooloo steak and ravioli Quality of food was good and was satisfying. The onion bread that came when u are seated is yummy too. A pity that the soup served was not piping hot,it was just slightly warm.Service was good. As they know that we were sharing, they actually divided the soup into 2 portion and served it to us.Steak was in correct doneness. Ravioli seemed to be a little undercooked as I could still taste some flour but if it was more cooked, it could be too soggy.Will definitely come back again :
4
We enjoyed the food and service. Overall everything was good. We were also informed that our mains will take approximately 30-45 minutes as there are multiple orders before our. We didn't mind. However, when the mains were eventually served, it was extremely staggered. By the time the second-last main came out, the first few served had already finished their dinner. It is without question that the steaks would be focused on since it is a steakhouse, but it wasn't nice for the others to wait for more than 15 minutes for their mains (non-steak entres) to be served. It was also unfortunate that an order was served wrongly, and that caused an even longer delay. Other than that, we are grateful for the quick rectification and genuine service.
4
Tomahawk, Lyonnaise potatoes were very good. A bottle of Antinori Brunello was excellent. The mushroom soup and Lobster Bisque were came out only lukewarm not hot as it suppose to be. Asparagus was good. Asahi beers serve cold. The services was decent. Nice vibe with decent space between tables (better than cut by Wolfgang puck which too squeezed). Overall, Morton's steakhouse is still the best. This one could be number 2 of best steakhouse in Singapore. Be prepared to pay 100S$ for 10% service charge and 7% tax.

Tried this place during Restaurant week. The service at Wooloomooloo was fantastic, service staff was polite, attentive and informative when advising the menu. However they could have been alittle more welcoming and proactive rather than waiting to be called. The food was excellent, however the Ribeye was rather small to be honest and doesn't deserve the S$10 upgrade fee due to its size. It was well cooked though, beef was tender and sauce was excellent. Steak was served with potatoes and asparagus, both also well prepared. The starters was a choice of salmon with greens or a tomato based soup. Both were good. Dessert was a little disappointing especially the lemon tart which was too creamy and liquid. Otherwise the place was fantastic, food was in general excellent
3
The filet mignons we ordered were good but we'd had better many times before in different restaurants in other countries for a lot fewer $$$$. The atmosphere was nice, the service good. Overall the experience was satisfactory but not exceptional.

We're always on the look out for good stake and looking at the ratings we decided to give this one a try.First impressions very positive: great view, nice ambience (though quite a large space) and a nice touch on the entrance decoration.But it's all about the steak at a steakhouse and when I pay 114$ (all in) for a Porterhouse I expect it to be perfect! So I asked for a medium/rare- rare and the stake came, honestly, as a medium/well! I obviously send it back and then I was approached by the maitre who was informed about my action (that was positive) went to check it, apologised and said he would have done the same. Oh well I thought... Good to know I am not an alien!But try #2 arrives and again that was a medium! maitre looks at it and agrees but I said it's ok...been late already, we'll keep it. Sadly aside of badly cooked the steak also tasted bad...Side dish was also nothing to write about, my wife's oysters were at least ok (and thus I generously don't give one star).After all this I was expecting at least something in return (in many restaurants they'd simply not charge you for that crap!) perhaps a complimentary dessert, but instead ....I got charged extra!! Two beers instead of the one I drunk while waiting for my +1 ... Probably because I had it asked for it twice to come. So yes when a restaurant is still empty and there are 5 waiters...a beer should not take more than 3 minutes to come. Or even 10, OK! But Longer?Major disappointment and waste of 230$ for one stake, one Orestes, two glasses of red and a..beer!!All in all a we left extremely disappointed and 240$ poorer for gets. So

We went to the restaurant on the 19 Oct to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Food was good and service was generally OK. Although, they seemed short handed even on a Monday evening. The male manager went out of his way to make sure the dinners were taken care of. Unfortunately there was another lady manager or senior service staff that had the face of a dead fish. She just kind of spoiled our mood. Also they put the dinners all in the same section and kept the rest of the restaurant closed. This made us felt like we were in a market place, loud and noisy. Not quite the romantic evening we were looking for
3
We were recommended this place by the concierge at our hotel so we were looking forward to a quiet romantic place with good food and nice wine. What a shock this was. The p,ace was noisy with loud Doris Day music being piped throughout and located in the middle of the shopping centre complex. We ordered fillet Mignon (grass fed) and rib eye with greens and potatoes. The steak was reasonable but for us Aussies nothing different to what we can do on the BBQ for quadruple the price. We were disappointed and wouldn't recommend it to our friends
5
Went there for my birthday dinner and was very happy with the experience. Food was excellent! We had the ribeye & in my opinion, it is better than Cut Restaurant & Morton's and it is definitely easier on the wallet too!The service is the factor that distinguish Wooloomooloo from the other steakhouse. Very attentive service (from the manager to the server) and it is for all diners! I was pleasantly surprised when they offered to take a photo at the bar for memory and they printed it out in a paper frame!Will definitely be back
4
Pretty well lit dining area in raffles city, the food though not perfect was good enough to satisfy the price we paid for. All in it was 700SGD for 6 diners. They do have a small issue with over seasoning their dishes but its not a deal breaker, the tomahawk steak at roughly 1.2kg which I had was quite the sight to behold. Reasonably marbled and though towards the core some blood started to be evident (I ordered a medium), it was understandable. And at $155 its a fair bit of meat. Far from the best but a decent steakhouse nonetheless
5
We went there in a group of 4 to celebrate a friend's birthday and ordered the Aussie ribeye steak. We really loved the quality, the portion and the flavour! The manager (Jack) was really attentative as well. They even offered to take a photo of us and make it in a frame. Great service overall! Will definitely come back :
3
To start with, this is our 2nd time back, the last time had an unpleasant experience of the front desk who lost our reservations. This time, we booked a birthday table for 5pax, but were given really a 4pax table. Kindly asked the front desk waitress yo change to a bigger table, her straight answer was a flat reply of "no. We are fully booked tonight."Upon seated we again turned to another waiter who was alittle more kind to meet our request to change to a bigger table. Overall the meal was good but not great. I would say the waygu tomahawk is really good so is the bread. Another than that, appetizers and desserts were really disappointing. The wine recommended wss great but to pay 400+ for 2 bottles of mid range wines i find that of rather poor value. An to cap it off.. We have to buy a dessert in order for a candle to be plated to the birthday person. Of which i think wooloomooloo is trying to peg its price point to the top 10% of finest restraunts in Spore but with such service standards and poor overall quality experience i am afriad it might be sorely disappointed that it will not be in the eyes of the consumers. PS: the restaurant was not fully booked. N they kept the best tables all empty.
4
Excellent food (delish) and the service was warm and friendly to begin with but got a little gruff at the end. (Perhaps the staff were tired?). We had two servings of Foie Gras (highly recommended), Lobster Bisque (a bit heavy on the palate), the Jumbo Prawn Cocktail and Cesaer Salad (both nothing much to shout about). The steaks were amazing (my husband and father-in-law are huge steak eaters and they loved it here). We ordered a Porterhouse (20oz) and a Tomahawk with Mashed Potatoes and Spinach and Mushroom as sides to share. Altogether, with 1 glass of wine, the bill came to $553. Great food and views of MBS. Would highly recommemd to anyone who loves their steak
4
We have been coming to Wooloomooloo for steak and ambience for the last 1.5 year. It never let us down. In fact, this time we were nicelely pleased when the manager recognised us on his way back home not feeling well, and instead escorted us to the restaurant and offered champagne before leaving. Very good touch. Food was great as always, we both ordered fillet mignon. For dessert I had a pavlova and my husband chocolate lava cake which were both delicious. We will be coming back soon.
5
Just a quick note to say thanks very much for the outstanding service last
night from Jack and his team. Above and beyond!
4
Great staff, nice ambience and terrific steak selection. The steak sometimes comes of more medium than rare but still tastes great.
4
We had our anniversary dinner there. We had a steak each (with 2 sides) and had 2 appetizers plus a soup and dessert. it amounted to $400 in total. U can request to serve the soup in 2 portions so both of u can have some of it. They will be more than willing to do so! Well, all i could say is, the whole experience was great, from the food to the service of the staff there. Definitely worth the price i paid for. Make a reservation in advance and request for the window seat, so u can enjoy the night view outside during the dinner, and quieter to be at the sides of the restaurant, if u like more privacy. Will recommend this place and will be back again
5
Wooloomooloo has become my favourite restaurant in Singapore very easily. The service and the food are both equally outstanding. The fantastic staff have a effortless skill in ensuring you feel like the most special guest in the restaurant while also leaving you to peacefully enjoy the supreme steaks. Couldn't recommend it more

I reserved a spot for the weekend and was sent an e-mail from Wooloomooloo saying that they are restricted at the time to having just a brunch menu at the time and ordering off the menu wasn't allowed, so if you're around for weekends before 3 keep this in mind. The staff was very nice and prompt to any issue that we had, and the atmosphere was quite lovely with a little fridge at the front of the building where you can see the freshly flown in meat.Just note that if you want to get a window seat you'll need to ask by reservation because we were unable to get it.This brunch menu was 5 courses and was incredibly filling, but we had to wait for a long time between courses, one of which due to the fact that the kitchen overcooked our risotto. As the restaurant is a steakhouse were were expecting the steak to deliver and I must say, the main courses were quite wonderful in addition to the Cobb Sandwich for the breakfast. However, I was not too much of a fan of the dessert and the pasta had too much creme for my taste. I think it'd go better if we could choose exactly what we got, but that's what happens when dealing with a course menu with limited choices.With all this in mind, this is a place that I would visit again if I was in the area, just not for brunch
5
Booked for lunch at 12 noon; was a little bit surprised to find out it was a fixed brunch menu only for Sunday lunch. Nonetheless the 6 course brunch at $68++ was pretty reasonable. Enough food and very well done. Service also excellent. Will try to come back in the future for ala-carte men

I ordered fillet mignon (medium). When placing the order, waiter asked if they could slice the meat into half, "butterfly style" so that they can get the doneness right. Seriously?! We said no and would prefer the meat intact. When it came, the fillet mignon was charred to the point of being burnt and hard on the outside. When sliced open, the centre was overcooked and gray inside! We asked for it to be replaced and done correctly. The waiter pointed his finger at us and said "but this gentleman said he didn't want it to be cooked butterfly style. If he had said yes, it would have been ok."We were in gaffaws! If you need the meat to be sliced open in order to get the doneness right, you are but an amateur chef. And honestly, as a fan of fillet mignon, we have never had to deal with requests like that from a restaurant. Now, when they came with a replacement fillet mignon, meat intact.... They got it right. Pink in the centre with slight traces of bloodiness in the core. The fact that they could get it right the 2nd time tells me that they COULD have gotten it right the 1st time but simply couldn't be bothered to.Service was poor. Food lousy. Tables were placed very close to one another and we can even hear the conversations in the tables around us. Hence our perception that they are overpriced and overrated. PLS DO NOT DINE HERE EVER!
5
Really strange dining experience. I ate here with a friends. We were welcomed properly. Our orders were taken timely. Watching the service team, they were doing an amazing job on a very busy Wednesday evening. Shortly after order was taken the owner jack fraser floats gracefully to our table and introduces himself. He apologies in the most genuine of manner that our steaks will take 40 minutes to cook. This did not make sense to us, pressing him for a justification for his statement, he diverted the conversation to a friendly conversation. We were so impressed that he had spent the time with us we were placated about the wait. The steaks arrived after 45 mins and were lovely. We ended the evening having a drink with jack in the bar. Will return despite the food delay. Kudo
5
This is my 4th time at Wooloomooloo and I am again won over by their excellent food and warm service. I was dining with my 2 sisters, one of whom we were celebrating her birthday. We all had the executive set lunch and unanimously chose the butternut squash soup, steak and a strawberry sorbet with white chocolate sauce with lychees. The set was perfect and at $42++, was a real deal. For a nice ending, my birthday sister even got a Polaroid picture taken with her desert well decorated with her name and a candle!!! Thanks Wooloomoolo....we will definitely be back!!
4
Jack, the general manager, makes the whole place tick. He's funny, attentive, charming, and ensures that the restaurant recovers from any missteps. And trust me, there are missteps.We went for dinner, and the molten chocolate cake we ordered, that's made to order, apparently collapsed/exploded in the oven. We were not interested in ANOTHER 20 minute way after the previous fifteen minute on. The lobster bisque had split, leaving it runny and curdled, instead of creamy and rich. Another of the sides we ordered, I forget what it was now, just tasted peculiar, with a sharp tartness instead of creaminess that we expected. That at least was taken off the menu once we highlighted it, but we didn't say anything about the bisque because it wasn't until later that I could figure out what i was so watery (and why there were curdles), and I'm not the sort to complain until I can figure out if something went wrong... or if a dish is generally bad.The steak though, the 1.6kg bone-in steak. Oh that steak. Was amazing. Tender, succulent, juicy tasty. And the beef carpaccio? Fatty and well marbled melt in your mouth raw beef. Quite simply, Wooloomooloo is a steakhouse, and they know their beef. Tread around the rest of the menu with care because it can be hit and miss... but damn. That beef. 
4
Brought our family of four to the restaurant and we were impressed by the food quality and service. Our kids loved the fillet mignon they ordered as well as the delicious sides. Will certainly visit again!
4
Great food and ambience. Bar tender is very passionate about cocktails and makes them very well. We ordered the tomahawk steak to share. It was cooked just the way we asked and it melted in the mouth.
5
had a bd dinner there. the staff was extremely attentive. the food worth every single penny paid. definitely will go there again
5
Came for lunch with my boss 2 weeks back, am blown away with the service rendered by Jack and his team. Cobb salad well seasons and flavoursome (have not had this for a long time in Singapore), is so refreshing to see this on the menu, great selections of steak to choose from and we both order the Filet Mignon, definitely will be back again to try their Wagyu Tomahawk which I feel are very well priced! Kudos to the team that create such an experience and bravo to the chef - Steak was so well cooked
5
This restaurant, a sister to the successful HK operation, is run almost completely by ex Mandarin Oriental Singapore management. That should give you a very clear overview of the levels of service you will receive. Jack Fraser, who recently won restaurant manager of the year, is so good, he remember that from 4 years ago I drank Aqua Panna.Location wise the restaurant is on the third floor of the Swissotel at City Hall with a great view over the Padang and the skyline. The restaurant is cleverly arranged in an arc so even diners without a window table still get to enjoy the view. The food - well it is a steakhouse......so as you would expect, decent cuts, well cooked as requested. We had the cajun spiced rib eye and it was excellent. Well flavored, well seasoned, juicy and blackened just right on the grill. Steamed spinach with mushrooms are similarly tasty as was the side of asparagus. We drank the house merlot and shiraz - both good value. One of our diners tried the salmon which was also cooked to perfection - not too dry as is often the case.4 diners with four mains and four glasses of wine - 540 SGD. Not cheap but by Singapore standards, reasonable value for excellent service and great quality food
4
The steak was EXCELLENT. I was there with four others for dinner and for a start we shared a crab cake which I highly recommend. For mains, I had the fillet mignon medium rare which I'm going to emphasize again, was excellent! It was so good I had it without any sauce. My friends had the beef wellington, the wooloomooloo steak and two shared the T-bone. Everyone enjoyed their food and agreed it was well worth the slightly higher prices. (Though I felt my steak was the best amongst all)The sides portion are rather huge and we couldn't finish them. It would be a comfortable portion for two to share. We had two mac-n-cheese, two mushrooms and a grilled asparagus. To top it off, we shared the wooloomooloo hot chocolate cake which was heavenly...a must try for all.So overall for the food, it is one of the best. Ambience is cosy but gets somewhat noisy so we had to speak up at times to be heard among ourselves. It's best to make reservations as all tables were taken even on the Wednesday night when we were there. We wanted to try the ladies night happy hour but learnt that this was only available at the bar area and reservations are needed as well. Service was inconsistent which we brushed it off as it being a full-house. It was at times difficult to get the staff attention as they were busy moving about. But when possible, they do ask how's the food, our water was topped up regularly and dishes cleared at the appropriate time. So we thought they could be understaffed. It might help if one staff is made responsible for two to three tables so that due attention could be given when needed.On the whole, I would recommend it to those looking for a good steak. For those who do not wish to have steak, they do have other options available like fish n chips. They have an extensive wine list too
4
Went there on sunday for their brunch and must say i really enjoy the food. There is I think 5 course but the one that steal my heart is the oyster and the steak. The oyster is just so so nice and the wellington steak is really yummy. Will definitely go there again
3
First off, I'm not a regular customer but have been going there at least 3 - 4 times a year since it opened. Only went once though in 2014 as the GF was on braces then and having steaks can be quite a challenge. This year with the braces (finally) off, we decided to return for my birthday. We've always loved the service, the attention to detail, quiet atmosphere and quality cuts of meats. It's not exactly the cheapest (or even best place) in Singapore for steak but the familiarity makes up for it. This year, I must say standards took a step down:1. Service is still great. Even the common waiter had good knowledge of the cuts / taste of the steaks on the menu 2. Lobster bisque used to be one of the hidden highlights of the place. This time it was watery and lacking in flavor3. Done-ness of my porterhouse was not even. Rare on one end, cooked on the other. Instead of making a new one, they just seared my existing piece again. To me, both are cardinal sins in the premium steak market place. 4. There were a couple of new sides to choose from and we were recommended the mushrooms in garlic butter. Nothing special and something you'd get out of a Jack's Place probably.Maybe I went on a bad night but I'm truly a fan of the place. Do hope they get their act back together again
5
Had Valentine's Day Dinner here.Service: 4.5/5Simply great service, they know when to approach you and when not to approach you.Food: 4.5/5Very well cooked steaks and sauces.Wine: 4/5We had wine paring that night. Perfect.Ordered 2 glasses of Bordeaux from the bar area after dinner, disappointing. Perhaps, they kept the bottle opened too long.Overall: 4.5/5Definitely coming back agai
4
Have always been to wooloomooloo whenever I'm looking for a good steak.Enjoyed the nice ambience and good service... I called to make a booking for a birthday celebration with my family and received an email from the restaurant if I would like to have a special arrangement such as glitters on the table or birthday wishes wordings on the dessert. The U.S. rib eye is my favourite, the meat is cooked to taste its juicy favour. It's costly but it's worth it!Note: lunch is cheaper than dinner and the quality is the same. Order "medium well" if you want a "medium"
4
Good restaurant but $80 is an expensive steak. To ensure you know you are overpaying a potato is another $16! Nice views. Service was just mediocre.
4
First of all you get what you pay for and in Singapore steaks are expensive to start with. The steaks here are around $80 and there are a few choices but we went with both the Australian ribeye and the woloomooloo steak which is a marinated ribeye. All steaks come with sauces. My medium rare steak came out medium (they messed the order up) but they were happy to replace it with a new medium rare (which I still felt was overcooked). Out of the two steaks I preferred the woloomooloo steak as I felt it had a little more flavour than the plain one. Other dishes ordered were the tuna tartare for entree as well as a few sides (creamed spinach, salad etc). As we were with the kids we ordered 2 kids items (not on the menu - mini burgers and spaghetti ). For desert we had the chocolate cake and a pavlova - I found the pavlova to be a bit too hard and the cake was a better option. The bill came to a lazy $400 without alcohol which is on the higher side of things here. Would I come back.. Yes probably.
3
Other than the manager, the service staff were not keen to serve so the service at best was average bordering on poor.Food wise was average too as the steak quality could be better
4
These steaks don't come piled with sauce! The true test of a great steak.I ordered the Angus sirloin, medium and it was served with the outer top lovely caramalised and just the right touch of pink inside. I went mmm....relishing every mouthful. I was thoroughly enjoying my steak, didn't even need the 4 sauces but nonetheless lovely when I chose to have them. My date had a filet mignon, medium-rare and also very well done. The onion loaf which they served was a wonderful touch to the meal. Its easy to get at Raffles City and of course, there is the view of the Padang and the lights of Singapore.Be prepared to fork out about $350 for 2 pax with wine and other alcoholic beverage. Dessert was good, I wouldn't croon about it. But oh yes, we will come back again
5
Considered a high end dining option.Had the beef wellington and risotto - cooked to perfection for the beef.Be prepared to fork out at least $300 for 2 person dinner. Reservation is highly recommended during weekend

As reviewed the steak is yummy. We reserved a table and had a view of Padang :) restaurant is crowded maybe best for friends and couple not suitable for family or kids. Side dishes are big portions so do not order too much! Will be back for next amazing steak :
5
I really appreciate the meticulous attitude of one of the waiter. He heard me coughing at the entrance - when I was brought to the seat, he offered me a cup of warm water to soothe my throat! Really appreciate the little action that he had done to make my experience in the restaurant a memorable one

We had dinner at this place and experience excellent service. Appetizer and soup is normal but the Aussie sirloin steak is excellent. So is the bread pudding dessert. The service crew keeps apologizing to us for the long time to serve dessert and I got a complimentary espresso
5
Not cheap but the steak was sensational. Service was good and the wine list was good too. If you are staying in the area and tired of chinese it is a good optio

I first made a reservation online on their website, but never received a confirmation. I then had to call and make another reservation. Kind of annoying, and I should have figured that was a sign. It was not a full house on a Friday evening, but service was very slow. We started with an iceberg salad, but it was too much lettuce and not enough blue cheese dressing, tomatoes, and bacon. We were almost finished with that before the wine even arrived. The waiter was apologetic so he was a little more generous with the wine. Waited almost 45 more mins for our steaks, and what a disappointment. Hubby picked a strip loin, which had so much fat on it, whereas that cut should have been lean. My ribeye was cooked medium, which I prefer medium well, but the waiter said it might be overcooked to my liking, so he suggested medium, that way it can be cooked longer if need be. Well it was rare, but I was so hungry and did not want to wait any longer, I ate it as is. As the waiter was prepping my baked potato, he realized it was not cooked enough so he sent it back. My husband said his wasn't even edible...how can you mess up a baked potato? They substituted mashed potatoes while they were re-doing his, and brought him a new potato after we were all done with our meal. I can't fault the waiter, and he was nice enough to comp the potatoes, but won't be going back

I've been to this restaurant 3 times over a timespan of a year. The first time I was impressed by the steak quality and overall value for money compared to other steak houses in Singapore such as Morton's. The second time was a little disappointing, but I thought of this as a little hick-up due to a busy night. Which brings me to the last visit... We were a party of 8 on a Sunday evening: to start I was not impressed by the way the staff tries to make you order alcohol as soon as you walk in. I came-in with my spouse and offered 'champagne' before having a chance to sit down. Service was otherwise slow and not to the standard you'd expect for such a place and price. The main issue there seems to have been an understaffed team.Most importantly, the quality of the 7 steaks we ordered ranged from average to mediocre and doneness was erratic, for example a medium-rare came well done. We sent one steak back and it was later replaced by a chewy sub-standard cut. Very disappointed, especially we were celebrating a close friend's birthday
4
We tried the 5 course brunch at 68++The courses were very good, well prepared and v tasty. In fact, the least popular course was the steak, mainly because the other courses were so good. The service was excellent. Not cheap, but nice to try 5 courses and certainly plenty to eat. Makes a nice change from the buffets on offer in Singapor
3
like why the title says, for the amount of money paid, I've had better. Let me begin with the sides. We ordered creamed spinach and Mac n cheese. It only arrived more than half way through our mains, and only after we asked for it. When it did arrive, both the sides were luke warm. Ok, the service was nice, they re-heated it for us.Next, we ordered the wagyu tomahawk for 298. For that price, I would have expected better. It was nice, but not like over the top nice, which I would have expected from this famed Australian steakhouse. Well, my company agreed largely with what I have written above, and it's up to you to be the judge.
4
It was worth every dollar spent. The service was good. Good choice of food and we enjoyed the evenin
3
It's ok but not the best steakhouse there is. Perhaps it is because I am travelling a lot in Texas but this is a quality under the good US steakhouses. Please note it is really not bad, but we were a little disappointe
4
Good Place to have a good Steak in Singapore. If youre staying at the swissotel stamford, its right down
5
Definitely out of our expectations. Service was impeccable, fast and attentive. We had the Spanish ham for entr√©e and it went perfectly well with the freshly baked onion loaf. The ham was really good, finally we could get the same quality that one would have expected to get in Spain. And came the steak. Wow, all our steaks were really good. For me, it's the best one I had in Singapore, way better than Cut and Morton's. Although a little overcooked but the quality outshined it. No doubt I'll be heading there again, or only there from now on, for my steak fix in Singapore

We arrived at Wooloomooloo and the hostess did not know where to seat us. She gestured us towards the dining area, we awkwardly stood there with no idea where to walk to. The saving grace - a second hostess apologized on her behalf and showed us in.Once we sat down, we placed our orders and noticed that while most tables got their bread served to them, we didn‚Äôt receive ours until after our starters arrived and only when we asked for it. There was neither apology nor any acknowledgement for the oversight, just a frown from the manager. The bread was amazing. During our order, we asked the staff to clarify if the veal fillet was carpaccio and we were told that it was‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt. The calm chowder was good.With ready made starters easy to dish out, service was fast, but we had to wait 20 minutes for our main. Twice when it was served, we asked if the meat was ribeye when it looked like a fillet mignon. The staff could not tell the difference between cuts of meat in a steakhouse. On our third attempt, the staff took the plates back and said he would check.We received our correct orders and the fillet mignon and ribeye were decent. The salad obviously came out of a plastic container prepared quite some time back and stored in an icy cold fridge. It was frozen, soggy, watery and tasteless. The potato chips were pre-fried then re-fried before service. One of the portions was cold. This is sadly an extremely disappointing visit. We had enjoyed all our previous visits to Wooloomooloo. It may have been Restaurant Week, but service and food standards should not have dropped this badly. There is no reason for us to return.This feedback was also provided to Wooloomoolo

This is the first time we were in Wooloomooloo and the family was unsure how my dad and mum with a combined age of over 180 are going to take in Western food in an unfamiliar environment. The warm service, the tasty food and the beautiful view making my dad's birthday celebration a happy one! 
5
Top-notch service! Extremely detailed in their planning and execution. Wondeful for anniversaries. They pay strong attention to your needs and what you like. Better still, the food and the view is great! Special mentions for the jumbo lump crab cake, foie gras and the steak. DELISH!
4
The choice on the menu is excellent and service is fast as a consequence it also feels a bit rushy. A less positive point is that the chairs are quite uncomfortable (too low). Part of the strategy to have a quick turnaround 
4
Food was good especially the steak. Service was as expected. Place was a little noisy as there was a big group of rowdy diners. Should have put them at a further corner for the convenience of other diners
4
Comfortable and relaxing place with a good view.Steaks done to my liking & I enjoyed the mash.Pity they don't have a kid's menu but definitely going back again to try their tomahawk
5
I booked the steakhouse for a friend's 30th birthday and from the moment I made the reservation online the service was excellent. They made the evening special with little touches, including confetti on the table, a birthday dessert and then a birthday card with a photograph of us all inside as a nice keepsake. We started in the bar for happy hour cocktails, which we enjoyed with the lovely skyline view. Then we moved through to the steakhouse. The steaks were excellent and so were the side dishes. It was also nice having a selection of steak sauces available on the table to try. The steaks are reasonably priced and the meat was excellent quality. There was a good range of cuts and weights to satisfy all our meat needs. However, unlike some other steak restaurants, the menu also caters for the non steak lovers with a good selection of other alternatives that were just as tasty. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to celebrate something special.
4
Dinner for 2 on a Saturday night was a great experience. We both ordered steaks, and were very happy with our meals. The filet mignon was beautiful- cooked perfectly. Staff were efficient and helpful. The sommelier recommended a lovely wine based on our preferences (reasonably priced, by Singapore standards.)As a lover of great steaks I'd highly recommend a visit to Wooloomooloo- we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food
5
We are residents of Singapore and have tried many good steak restaurants including Mortons and The Cut. The thing that makes Wooloomooloo 'a cut above' is that the food is so well thought out and executed, you get a selection of delicious sauces to have with your steak, there is a great selection of side dishes which are all excellent - the steak itself is cooked to perfection and just the right size. There is a great selection of starters & deserts too - if you have room for anything more!The restaurant is not pretentious but you feel you are in the lap of luxury. A lovely view adds to the meal over the Padang and city skyline.Jack the Restaurant Manager has made our visits more special than ever. From day 1 he greeted us and made us feel like we were VIP guests. This didn't falter once - his management of the restaurant is outstanding, he is clearly highly respected by the staff who all do an excellent job.I have clicked the family button as we often brought our 2 girls with us but I have also enjoyed many romantic evenings with my husband here.If you haven't tried it - I strongly recommend
4
I brought my wife and sister in law for my wife's birthday treat, and the restaurant offered to decorate the table with sprinkles/stars. . . The stickers of the stars were nice but the balloon stickers were eyesores. Yellow, blue, red balloons against the dark, classy tabletop? Seriously? Reminded me of kindergarten. Made the overall look feel cheesy and cheap. The food was great, we had the spatchcock and my sister said its the best poultry she had ever eaten. For us the prawn cocktails were fresh and refreshing in our mouths. Good recommendation. The tomahawk was not bad too, with just the right smatterings of fats and juiciness. Nothing like our favorite florentine beef from bistecca Tuscan steakhouse, but we found it way better than morton's. Though the dessert came after half an hour, it was luscious and not overly sweet for me, and they made a point to apologize. We had a good time chatting, so we did not hold them to it. Service, and the relevant add ons for the birthday celebration was not bad, but then Lawry's was more dramatic and Morton's more generous. One major downside is the market-like atmosphere of the restaurant. Quite enclosed and noisy, like marche. Good thing it wasn't a romantic meal
4
The restaurant seems set to give Morton's a run for their money. Must try their wooloomooloo steak, souffle, hot chocolate cake. The fish, etc is very good but not the main event.
2
My wife and I have our Christmas Even dinner at Wooloomooloo for the first time and find that the steak is not value for money. We have fresh oysters which were good, salad which is reasoable but the main course of steak was a let down, We have both Ripeye done medium but the steak was dry and not tender although the portion was big. We finished off with the chocholate cake which is the best of all the dishes.Will I be back? Not at the price that we pay
5
We came here for drinks one night and were amazed at the roof top bar. It's in a great spot with a 270 degree view of the harbour and city. The drinks were reasonable and the view fantastic. Would definitely recommend popping up here for a drink or two and drinking in the night
4
My party of four had the 4-course christmas lunch set for 68++ per pax, which was value-for-money considering the large serving size of each course. I ordered the steak for my main course and it was juicy and succulent. No wonder Wooloomooloo has the reputation of being one of the best steakhouses in Singapore. However, it was a busy afternoon and service was a little inconsistent. On several occasions I found that it was difficult to get the attention of waiters. My glass was not refilled promptly and the soup came without a spoon. However, it was commendable for most of the staff to maintain a professional and cheery attitude despite their apparent busyness. That is except for the girl at the reception, who gave an obviously unhappy face when i asked for her help in taking a picture. This put an unpleasant end to an overall lovely experience at Wooloomooloo.
5
Wooloomooloo is a place for dining quality steak with reasonable price. Service is out off the question...question is how this place manage to get such well trained staff working for. Cocktail drinks have more options to choose...in case you don't know what to drink...just tell them your feeling, they will come up with awesome drinks you will have to order twice...or even more..
5
If you are a fan of red meat, this place overlooking the Singapore skyline is the perfect venue to into a porter house steak... Absolutely fantastic...
3
With a name like Wooloomooloo Steakhouse you would think that a restaurant with an Australian name would at least serve some Australian beer/s, but sadly not. Drinks were overpriced, even a bottle of water cost $12, a glass of wine at least $18. The fillet mignon was great, even at $62 each, but then again it would want to be. Doubt I would return when I'm next in Singapore
2
I felt like a decent steak so we thought we'd try this place as it was close to our hotel, but one look at the menu and there was no way we were going to pay $60 for a steak. Everything else seemed way too pricey as well.
4
Is my first time there with my family,first impression when you walk in,you will like the atmosphere.We try from appetizers,soup,main course and dessert.Staffs are friendly,sometime not attentive because when busy,they look like under staffs.Appetizers and soup abit over priced for a single serving same to the desert.Beefs we tried tomahawk,well that I enjoy it,they serve with 4 kinds of sauce.Try best medium cook,because of it thickness medium rare or done may upset you will bloodly centre.And at a corner there's a wine corner were you can try some wine on display first before you order it.That what I call service with a touch.Finally we say is a wonderful dinner ! Will come back again
1
I went to this restaurant have a dinner. I'm ordered a starter : foie gras. Not fresh at all and oily. How terrible for it. And some more i ordered steak for my main course! The beef overcooked and not what I want for the tender. This is the terrible chef cooked this steak and I knew they are busy but the chef in charged can't even sent out the overcooked steak for me! I wanted to complain to the manager and no one free to talk to me! The service really bad really terrible. Even they busy, they didn't bringing the "smile" on their face to served to all of the gusts. I paid so much to have this kind of service to served me! Today really is my bad luck to have a dinner here! I just wondering how the manager train all the service staff. No standard at all.What a lousy restaurant. I won't come back to have second time for it!
4
On an ongoing quest to try the best steak restaurants in Singapore and visited for the first time. Had the tomahawk with a friend. The portions are generous and the beef tender. It was fairly well executed and the accompanying sauces were tasty. Does it rank in the top 5 steak restaurants in Singapore? Personally, not. Perhaps it's the Australian beef as I generally prefer US or Argentinian. Also, the beef is not dry-aged lending to a less intense flavor. But service was good, ambience pleasant and the wine list extensive. And this will not be my last visit
4
Well, steak is excellent. Service is good. suggest restaurant to waive off the corkage if to purchase one bottle from in-house wine. Or BYO for one the week day.
5
I had a fabulous meal at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse in Singapore. It has delicious food, attentive service and a great atmosphere. I ate the signature steak with three sauces. It was cooked beautifully, utterly tender and the presentation was wonderful. It was a delicious and memorable steak. The BEST I have had in Singapore. The starters, sides and puddings are all a real treat too. The service was brilliant. The manager Jack was very warm and welcoming on my arrival. I had the lovely Cat looking after me during my meal. She ensured I had a great table, looked after my order and kept my glass topped up. The atmosphere is wonderful for a fun catch up with friends. It has a very impressive cold storage for the beef and impressive wine stores on show. The lighting and mood is very sophisticated and welcoming. There is a great Bar area. You also can sit outside with your drink and have a great view.This is a brilliant restaurant and is one everyone based in Singapore or visiting should eat at
3
Fair steak. Fair personel. Fair service. Related to the price this restaurant is overrated. I will not go back, because there are better places for a good steak in Singapore
5
When in Singapore over the F1 we chose to dine at Wooloomooloo and we certainly weren't disappointed. The views were spectacular as was the attentive service. We started with the foie gras, the scallops, the crab and the prawn cocktail. All were fresh, delicious and a great light starter to begin our meal. The wine menu was excellent too and the staff were hugely knowledgeable about what would go best with your main course. Half the table ordered the Beef Wellington which looked superb and the USDA Rib Eye was extremely well cooked, seasoned and possibly one of the best steaks we've had in a long time. The sides and bearnaise were enough to fill us so no room for pudding sadly but I would recommend Wooloomooloo to all staying or residing in Singapore for a first class dining experience and a proper good steak
4
Nice Steak house that is not overpriced and the portions are generous. Had the prawn cocktail the sauce was delicious but the prawns should have had the spines taken out. My steak was cooked to how I requested an i enjoyed the melody of vegetables. Will definitely go back again
4
Went to Wooloomooloo for our Wedding Anniversary Dinner. The atmosphere was good we were seated at a table next to the window so could see some views of Singapore. Had the Prawn cocktail the prawns were big and the cocktail sauce was delicious, only negative point would be they could have taken the oran spines out and give a finger bowl to clean your hands afterwards. Steaks for the main where excellent and good value for money and gutting a choice of sauces was a good idea. Would definitely go back again for the right occasion
4
The Wooloomooloo Steakhouse has to rank as one of the best but it is pricey and the wine is probably the most expensive of any restaurant in Singapore but the beer is reasonable. I recommend the Beef Wellington but there are plenty of other Steak as well as fish dishes on the menu and according to the rest of the family the meat just melts in the mouth. My only complaint is they played the music far too loud making conversation difficult. We had to ask several times for it to be turned down which on occasion is was but after a little while the volume was turned back up again. The loudness of the music took the shine off what should have been an outstanding evening at a prestige restaurant especially given the price of the bill
4
I went there with my family for lunch. The restaurant had an unique concept, where they serve you the soup and appetizers from the menu and you get to choose your meat from a buffet. The service was fantastic and we felt very comfortable. The service manager came around very often to ensure that we were alright. He went on to get the meat grilled to our liking. They had good choice of quality meat to chose from. The whole dining experience was made special with the attention and wonderful service. We will definitely return to the Wooloomooloo
4
This place was recommended by a close friend when I was searching for the perfect venue to arrange a birthday dinner surprise for my bf. Service here was excellent; worked out a pre-arranged dinner menu with the help of Noel the GM of Wooloomooloo who recommended a few of their best-sellers. My personal favorite was the starter - Sauteed Garlic Prawns in Gew√ºrztraminer Sauce.Love the cozy x intimate ambiance at night with the view of CBD night skyline at the backdrop. We definitely enjoyed ourselves; staff were friendly and helpful. Would love to visit again for another special occasion with my significant other
1
very poor servers: none of them has a present smile, greetingsi have NO greeting, NO eye contact when stepped in; I had reservationJess (?) the captain - horrible attitude, took order wrongly at first go; no eye contact, no apologies, servers when served food, no smile, no explain of what was served; pathetic;nevertheless, Jack the GM was nicefood was way over priceGo to Morton - don't waste money with Wooloomoolo

I was invited for a private dinner event and the whole restaurant was booked out for this purpose. This is my first time visiting the place. Ambience was quite dark, the walkway at the main entrance had black and white photos hung on one side, a showcase on the right featuring some bottles of wine and they had a (chilled) wine cellar too. The interior had an aboriginal featured wall to give that little touch and adds meaning to its very OZ name. As it was a private event, I believe the place was rearranged with some seatings n tables taken away. There's a bar which we didn't check out. The atmosphere is what you would expect of a sit down "wine and dine" place. We had an open kitchen concept for the session and as limited selections of the menu were served, I hope my review is a good interpretation of their regular menu, if not the food quality. The roasted OZ black angus ribeye/striplion was oven grilled to order and done medium rare, cooked on e outside, tender and pink on the inside. Good on its own. The HP sauce I added on the side actually ruined the natural taste of the meat, so I ate it without the sauce. I haven't had lamb in the longest time as they tend to be very chewy and for a person with braces, it's a chore to chew. I was tempted by the lamb racks on display and decided to try some. Turned out to be the best choice of the night, the lamb seemed hard to cut through with a fork at first (no knives were provided for unknown reason), but after you put it in your mouth, it's actually so tender and good. The wine sauce was a little pale in taste and failed to impress. The salmon was, in my opinion, overdone and did not stand out as much as the meats. It came across as a little dry and flaky. I was looking forward to try barramundi tonight as I saw it on their menu prior to arriving and I've heard it's quite unique to OZ. But unfortunately, none was served tonight. It was a shame. Dessert was an assortment of cakes, some sort of a puff canap√© in cream sauce (not so good) and macarons. Tiramisu was really good and I have a soft spot for the delicate little macarons, I tried all of the flavours on display and all were yummy, especially the pretty pink dusted ones (rose?), raspberry and chocolate ones. The canap√©s that were going around did not do any magic, and felt like a waste of tummy space/calories. The mini chicken patty burger were dry and rather rubbish. The artichoke on bread did not impress either. Perhaps the finger bites are prepared only for this event and do not appear on their regular menu. The chefs on duty were friendly and kept their smiles, good to see that they weren't frowning over repeat faces going for several rounds of food. Overall, I think its a place worth a try if you are a carnivore. But for the hefty price tag, maybe it would be a place to go only for a special occasion, if they have a special deal going on, or if you are like me, invited for a complimentary dinner session and going for the first time
4
Had dinner there recently and I must say that it definitely has one of the best service in Singapore. Staff are well trained and willing to answer all the questions you had on their steaks. Oysters were very fresh. Beef tartare was excellent. Would recommend their US ribeye steaks, however one of our steaks came well done instead of medium rare, but they promptly replaced it
5
Celebrate my partner's birthday dinner over at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse last night and it was our first visit dining here. We was brought to our table by the window view and our table were decorated with those small "mini happy birthday" decorations. Thank you guys for the gesture knowing it is my partner's birthday.Such a beautiful cosy place for a candle light dinner if you're looking for a quiet place for two. Staff were friendly & efficient with the way they work. We ordered Wooloomooloo steak & this 12 ounce Aussie steak, Our steak was served perfectly just the way we asked for & the price are really affordable for those who are craving for some steak. And lastly we tried their famous chocolate lava cake which is superb! Would definately return again. Kudos to the team, keep it up
4
Came here recently with work colleagues for drinks and dinner. Happy hour prices are quite reasonable with martinis at $12++. Steaks are good but are certainly not cheap, starting at around $60++ and heading northwards from there. Side dishes are at additional cost on top. Good choice of wine, but again the prices are fairly hefty
1
The restaurant was booked thru CHOPE and there was 3 separate phone calls to confirmed there was a fireworks view due to Singapore's National day. Upon arrival at the restaurant and being first few to arrive, we were shown to a table right behind a big pillar. I was taken aback as the minimum spend was 128++ and the pre agreed seating was conveniently forgotten. Then I realized there was a empty table with full fireworks view and to my disgust it was "reserved". The staff told me straight to accept my table allocation or just too bad. I had no choice but to walk out.Following an email exchange the restaurant flip-flopped and accused me otherwise that there was no arrangement for a fireworks view and I was offered alternative tables but I rejected. This is grossly untrue and they tried to hand me off when I asked for compensation. Why would I bother to get all dressed up and pay such a high minimum spend to sit behind a pillar???Poor service and poor PR. High handed treatment to treat my family whom had 2 senior citizens looking forward to fireworks dinner
4
Had a family dinner there last night and ordered the Wagyu Tomahawk Steak for 4-5. Steak was charred to Medium Rare perfection. Simply melts in your mouth and one of the fattiest cut around. Throughly impressed with the quality of Steak and I believe it could be even more flavourful if dry aged rather than wet aged. The Starters were also very good; Tartare, Parma Ham, and home made cheese. Not many Steak houses can match the Tomahawk Steak at Wooloomooloo
1
I did not eat here; I rang to reserve a table from my hotel, and the line was poor, with a background clicking. The server who answered commented on this ( she could clearly hear me) and I explained the issue. Her response - she put the phone down. Very customer friendly
4
Went for a meeting and was surprised what good value the set lunch was! Tender steak was cooked just right (had asked for medium rare) and the house wine it was paired with was excellent. The starter and dessert weren't anything to shout about, but IMHO that's acceptable as the entire meal was around $50! Doesn't hurt that the restaurant has a great view and tip-top service either!
5
The lobster bisque and the sirloin steak combo will work all the time. Add to that the warm cheese and onion huge bread roll that is complementary and you attain gastronomic nirvana..
4
A friend had waxed lyrical about the restaurant so we thought we would give it a try.Service was slow at first and the waiter had to be corrected several times when he repeated our order. The food was fine. Well cooked, nice presentation, sensible portions. Although perhaps a little pricey it's worth trying but didn't rock our world.
4
Made a last-minute dinner reservation at Wooloomooloo when a friend showed up in town unexpectedly for the weekend and Morton's was full. The lady who took the reservation was very accommodating and moved things around so we could get our preferred slot. Showed up, had a glass of bubbly at the bar before being shown to our table. Nice, romantic ambience with dim lighting and a killer view. I had the lobster bisque, which could have done with a bit more lobster meat, but which was tasty nonetheless. My partner had the french onion soup - seemed just alright to me. Main courses were excellent, cooked perfectly to order and meat quality was superb. I like the fact that you're served the whole range of sauces with your steak and don't have to pick just one. The broccoli side was a bit tasteless for me but I loved the creamed spinach and baked potato. Service wasn't overbearing, but friendly and professional. No complaints there.Overall a very nice meal that set the tone for a lovely evening as well. Thanks Wooloomooloo

Had an executive set lunch with the family on a weekday. So was expecting a quick lunch and it didn't disappoint. For the set menu, we were offered a salad or soup for appetiser, then crabmeat Aglio Oglio, Aust Fillet Mignon, and Barramundi fillet; finished with Profiterole. Price range S$3X - $4X. Service was fast and efficient although we had to remind our server for some sauce. They were generous with the focaccia though - we had 2 servings! Check out the pic! For a reasonable executive lunch, whether to entertain your business associates or just a good meal in a fine setting, this was worth it
5
Booked this for my wife's birthday and our first "western" meal since moving to Singapore. As such we were prepared to push the boat out and pay more than we have been getting used to paying for food out here. In a nutshell it was very nice. Wine was great (albeit expensive as you'd expect here), the bar & cocktails were great and when we sat down for dinner the table had been discreetly decorated with birthday celebration things.The food was very good. We shared the wagyu carpaccio started although it was more "moist" than expected it was still tasty. Our steaks were good too - I opted for the porterhouse and though it wasn't of the standard of places in the UK like the Hawksmoor it was still good. My wife's ribeye was very good though and I'd probably get that for the next visit. Admittedly neither were the best steaks we'd ever had, despite the price, but it was still a very enjoyable meal for a special occasion in a lovely part of town. Perfect for a birthday :)To cap it all off, the staff took our photo (an out-of-the-blue request) and then gave us a free copy of the photo at the end of the night - a really nice touch
4
If your navigationally challenged it may take a few minutes to find. When you do the the focaccia with onion fresh from the oven is a really great start. Just don't eat a whole one otherwise finishing the really great quality steak will be tough. Reasonable if not unbelievable view as well
4
Me and my wife was fascinated to have a good steak, we had a fair good steak with a nice bottle of wine. The staff was friendly and the service was unquestionable. We will surely recommend to our other expat friends for sure
4
The wife and I went there. The wife had Salmon and I had beef. The staff were great, Bit dark in where we were seated so I was unable to see how my steak was cooked. I asked for medium to well done. The centre was a bit raw though as I could taste that. The only negative of the night. The wife had 2 drinks which were to her liking. We both had a different sweet and both hit the spot. Little bit pricey, $62 for a steak
4
I went to Wooloomooloo Steak House for early dinner. I had only one goal, finish a one and a half kilo Tomahawk Steak.... I did it.The restaurant is on level 3 at the Swissotel Stamford. The staff are very friendly, service is excellent and the food very good. The restaurant has a good view of the Esplanade theater and the Marina Bay Sands. They have a small balcony where you can sit out and have a drink with a view of The Padang cricket ground.I had a glass of Argentine Malbec wine and what I came for, the one and a half kilo Tomahawk steak. The steak was very nice and the mashed potatoes smooth, creamy and probably the best I've had.Tomahawk steaks are available in Australian beef or Waygyu beef.As you can imagine it was a big steak leaving no room to try any other dish or dessert. Maybe next time
3
We went here, as we'd heard good things about Wooloomooloo and my wife enjoyed it 4 weeks earlier.We booked early (630), as we wanted to enjoy the dusk view and ordered cocktails and sat on the terrace by the bar. Drinks service was slow but the view from the bar terrace made up for it. We asked for mini burgers with our drinks and the dinner menus, so we could browse before our dinner, while enjoying our drinks and the view. My wife said the mini burgers were delicious and we moved to the main dining room on time.The restaurant had impressed us through the reservation by confirming a window table and this is what we got. Well worth it, with a view over the Padang.My son ordered the fillet steak with fries on the side, I had the Wellington with some more sides and my wife continued with the cold cuts platter she had been so impressed with the last time.The table service was impeccable and the main courses arrived fairly swiftly. Surprisingly, the sides did not arrive at all and we were part way through the steaks when the restaurant manager came to the table to enquire how things were. We asked after the side dishes and he went himself to the kitchen and returned, immediately, with them, apologised and served them himself.The fillet was good, according to my son. My Wellington steak was cooked to perfection but the pastry was soggy and unimpressive. The jus sauce that came with it, however, was amazing! Very tasty indeed and complimented the steak perfectly. My wife found the cold cuts a little dry, compared to her last experience.When the restaurant manager visited us again, to ask how things were and she mentioned she noticed a change, he immediately followed up and reverted to us about the change that had been made in the last few days and asked her opinion of the change. Impressive service!We followed up with desserts. I had the lemon and lime meringue pie and my son had the shortbread cheesecake. He asked for the sauce to be on the side and the waitress had no problems giving him exactly what he asked for.However, the desserts were very disappointing. The pastry of the lemon lime pie was soggy and the flavour of the pie itself was overpowered with overly sweet meringue, with hardly any 'tang' from the lemon or lime.The cheesecake was even worse. The cheesecake itself was good but the shortbread base was soggy and tasted mainly of undercooked flour. There was no buttery, flaky taste you'd expect of a good shortbread.Instead of the desserts allowing us to leave on a high, we left disappointed, feeling we'd been served desserts from yesterday.Overall, good service, particularly from the restaurant manager, with a few minor mistakes, great steaks, good sides but poor deserts

I visited the restaurant for a biz dinner. The restaurant is nicely decorated, wood shelves stacked with ... wood logs! The service was attentive and a very special thank you to Jack, the sommelier.He helped choose some great wines and his own choice was very well received by myself and my guests. The steaks were done to perfection as were the sides and the starters.The atmosphere is very pleasant, a large table of guests arrived shortly after us but it appeared that everyone was served within a reasonable time.We ordered some port and tasty cheese and desserts to round off the evening but were happy to receive a complimentary glass of brandy. The price came to about S$1900 for 4 of us but we had an unforgettable time and highly recommend this great place for a special treat.Thanks for a wonderful night

Was in the restaurant with my partner. restaurant is nice, no doubt about that. Steaks are of good quality and wine list is good. Service at times slow (bar and restaurant). Worth going.One thing... better take your platinum or better black credit card

I arrived at Wooloomooloo with great expectations since I had been craving a good steak, and it was after all, supposed to be a steakhouse.The ambience was nice, with the best seats (in my opinion) being those along the large windows with views of the Padang and surrounding area. Service started off decent, although it took some time for me to be served water or have my order taken.I ordered the Executive Set Lunch, which changes every week. I had the prawns with thai salad which was well seasoned, but spoiled by the salad which was dry and had clumped together. The steak (Ribeye), which was the reason why I had come, was flavourful but had too many parts that were chewy and not digestible (see photo; viewer discretion advised). I‚Äôm uncertain if this was due to the meat not being butchered properly, or if it just not a good cut of meat (nearer the loin end perhaps). I also asked for it to be done Medium, but it was Medium Rare at best. The cr√®me brulee was OK but nothing extraordinary.Service took a dive for the worse too. I had given feedback to two of the service staff who said they would feedback to the kitchen, but I never heard back from them. When I queried the waitress who processed my bill, she said the kitchen did not respond, and in the same breath, asked me if I would like to join the Wooloomooloo membership. I was stunned; she was obviously not listening - I had just given negative feedback and not heard a response. She then proceeded to suggest I come back for their weekend brunch. Absolutely clueless.Overall, a disappointing meal, perhaps because the restaurant cuts corner for its (relatively) reasonably priced set lunch. But one would expect a steakhouse to at least get their steaks right. 2.5/5 Not recommended

Interesting place. It's connected to a hotel and mall. The inside decor consists of split logs though out, kinda like kindling. I thought it was maybe used to grill the steaks, but was told that the wood acts like a humidor. They also had a cold room up front where they wet age the steaks that you can tour. The restroom is out in the mall.The steaks were alright, but nothing special. I ordered the Wooloomooloo steak, which is a rib eye with Cajun spice. Only mine didn't have the Cajun spice. Ruth's Chris would have been better. I was surprised by one thing. I ordered my steak medium and it came out medium rare. I tried to eat around the edges where it was more medium than medium rare. I then asked that it be cooked a little longer; instead grilled me an entirely new steak. That would never happen in the US. We had the Wooloomooloo lemon and lime pie, which was excellent.

Visited this restaurant last month for lunch with family before fly back to our country was a great place to finish our holiday. The food was fabulous and the Assistant Manager Faisal was so attentive,energetic,and always check our satisfaction either from the food or drinks. The set menu is to die for. Will be back soon :

Decided to make a reservation for two after reading some good reviews about this steak restaurant.Wooloomooloo was one of the new and upcoming mid range steakhouses that opened it's doors within close proximity to other steakhouses such as Cut, ruth and chris and mortons.I reserved a seat beside the window where you could catch a glimpse of the padang and for those wanting to dine while having a sun set beside you, getting a window seat maybe an option to consider. First up was the onion bread. The must have before anything else arrives. The warm bread was done very well and along with the butter, it was comfort food for the hungry me and brought up my expectations before the steak arrived. I ordered the USDA prime Ribeye while my wife ordered the chilean seabass. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came just expected. The steak was tender and juicy and there was just the right amount of beefiness that came with each bite. The sauces that came with the steak were just as good and I recommend trying out their black pepper sauce to go long. The only gripe I have is that the staff the restaurant came by more than a couple of times asking us how the food was. I appreciate their enthusiasm in getting feedback but the number of times they came somehow interrupted the privacy I would have liked to have.That being said, the service was good, water was filled up promptly and service came with a smile. Overall a good experienc

Visited with the family for a celebration. Great steak, very good service. Worth the price for something special
5
Great food, and a very fine view. Can't go wrong if you want a Australian influenced steak in a contemporary setting. The Wooloomooloo Steak was quite flavourful and cooked properly the spices added nicely to the cut. Service was great. Getting there can be a little awkward if you use the stairs/escalators. You will be brought into the shopping mall of which you have to make a few left turns in order to get to the Woolworth of which is at the end of the hallway
5
After reading several reviews about Wooloomooloo steakhouse I decided to see with my own eyes. It lived to the expectations. Excellent steak, services and atmosphere. Worth every penny of the bill
5
We visited the Wooloomooloo Steakhouse a couple of weeks back and it was fantastic. The food was amazing and the service was very good. Jack, the Restaurant Manager, was also very attentive and I highly recommend visiting this place
4
We had a good experience here. There was a good selection of different types of steaks and starters. We ordered steak tartare starter and for main we had rib eye steaks that were cooked perfectly. The service was good and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We would come back again
5
It was a great way to end Christmas Day. Location - centrally located, easy to get to. Food - awesome. Great selection for set dinner for Christmas. It was almost perfection. Drinks - martinis were perfect! The mocktails we just as perfect. Try the "cool chill". It will be a hit for all ages. Ambiance - sufficient lighting that it was not too dark, yet we can see what we were eating. However, wished there was table that allowed us not to sit across from each other. It is just a preference not a criticism. Service - this was of course the clincher. Jack the restaurant manager, went out of his way to accommodate to my guest's dietary restrictions (seafood allergies). We felt totally welcomed and at home. The staff were warm, courteous, professional and attentive. We can't ask for better. It was a great way to spend Christmas night's dinner.Once again - applause and appreciation to Jack and his staff
3
Overall, WSH offers diners the option of a good quality steak dinner without the feeling of being fleeced which usually the sentiment at steak restaurants in Singapore. WSH does however need to work on improving table service which is very patchy. Also recommend it reviews it's air conditioning levels as dining under a cold mistral is not enjoyable. Further, it would be fair to say that their seats are too low for their tables
4
Went down for lunch with a couple of friends and stuck to the Christmas set menu. The steaks are awesome here and they're a good alternative to the more pricy places.The salmon avocado salad was simple. A tad too simple I might say. A handful of mixed greens sitting on top of a flat bed of salmon. The turkey leg confit was very nicely done and came with some gravy, brussel sprouts and potatoes. A little salty but I loved the texture with it still being a little soft in the inside so you don't have to saw your way through the meat.The dessert was a nice bread pudding with a ball of rum and raisin ice cream seated on top of it. Overall, I guess we enjoyed a pretty good lunch and my guests left with a good impression of the place. The service - staff were polite but seemed hesitant to engage or converse with guests which made it felt somewhat mechanical and cold
5
We took an acquaintance from out of town here in July. You do need reservations. Once there, the staff takes care of you. We enjoyed a drink at the bar prior to seating. The menu is predominantly beef but other options are available. The steaks were the best we have had while in Singapore. Starters, salads are large and can be shared. The sides are large portioned. Wine selection is good
5
My husband and I had the filet mignon and the sirloin, and the Australian beef was cooked perfectly as ordered and delicious. Side orders of baked potato, spinach, mushrooms were also excellent. Service was friendly and attentive and there was a good list of wines by the glass, as well as a very well made mojito to start. An appetizer of shrimp was a bit dry although the shrimp were quite large. The ambiance is cozy and attractive, with a large room that is well divided into areas. We had a nice table by the window. Wooloomooloo is the equal of Morton's, and better than many other expensive steakhouses. I would definitely return, we really enjoyed this dinner

I visited this restaurant with my grandma, aunt and dad in Nov 2013. I rarely go for fine dining in Singapore, but had some fantastic culinary experiences in restaurants overseas at a value added price; I would say up to 1/3 of what we paid here. When I saw the pricing in the menu, I expected something really amazing, but somehow it just fell short.ServiceService staff are attentive, courteous and polite. Its just that generally, the overall experience seems to lack the 'wow' factor. Minor things such as ensuring water is topped up, getting the drinks order 100% correct and getting the correct special order dishes served can go a long way. Even in places such as Earle Swensens' the service here would be considered amazing, but for the prices paid here I expected more.FoodDidn't order any steak or sugared drinks so can't comment on those. I really liked my food - had the Cream of Forest Mushroom, which tasted beefy, flavourful and delicious with the added croutons. Ravioli with Ricotta and Spinach with lovely, creamy texture and overall taste. Again though, for the prices charged I was expecting to have my mind blown, but the food was just 'good'. Portions were a tad on the small side, and having a starter and a main course did not make me full.AtmosphereNice setting, with a decent view of the city. Nice for a special night out or a romantic evening.Sad to say, the rest of my family were probably even more disappointed than I was - same reason being that they had better experiences and food in other restaurants at cheaper prices. While it was a nice experience (as I wasn't the one who paid the bill :S), I would not come back here again
4
There seem to be high end steakhouses popping up everywhere in Singapore these days, and this is one I have been wanting to try for a while. It's perfectly decent, even good, but I was a tad disappointed since I was expecting that 'wow' factor. The restaurant itself is rather large, and though nicely decorated, lacks the cosy or romantic atmosphere I craved. The service is professional and attentive. The food was good. I only tried the steaks, and both were big and tasty (Australian rib eye and Wooloomooloo special). However, I have had better, cheaper steaks so I wasn't exactly blown away. What I did like was that they brought a wide variety of complimentary sauces and condiments. If I remember correctly, at Wolfgang Puck's Cut in MBS, you have to pay for your sauces. The side orders of baked potato and spinach were generously portioned. I had a pavlova for dessert which was rather nice. I don't see it so often on the menu here in Singapore. The closest comparison I can make is to Cut, and I have to say Cut has the edge on atmosphere, service and decor. Would I come here again? Probably not. But glad to have tried it
4
We have been trying to get a reservation here on Fridays and Saturday for a while, but never had luck. We finally went on a Sunday night as we had a friend and her parents over from Malaysia. The place wasn't packed but the ambiance was great!We had great service and food. I had the filet mignon which was pretty hefty but was done just the way I like it and the sauces were very nice, I preferred the peppercorn sauce to the other 3. Will definitely make a return visit
5
I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary. From what i onserved, the service standards are high, from waiters to sommelier. I ordered garlic prawns, signature steak and alcoholic drinks. The steak was flavourful and well seared, and we love the fragrant peppercorn sauce. After we finished eating, a kind lady staff (Kat or Cat, not sure) chatted with us and knowing it's my anniversary, offered to take a pic of me n gf, and printed a photo (with wooloomooloo card sleeve) with kind wishes. I was delighted with the service which is hard to find nowadays in singapore restaurants. Kudos to the management for very good service. I shall return here again
5
Started the evening at abt 5.30 and ended at 11pm. This gives u a pretty good idea how good the nite was at this restaurant. We started with beer with a view of CBD and Marina Sands which we ended the nite having brandy and coffee with the nite lights. We had the tomahawk Wagyu for our main, 1.5kg, $245. I'll say is for 3 person at least...I doubt a dating couple can finish it. The service staff is ever so attentive thou the restaurant was busy, they were alwys around to check on our needs. A great place to dine to impress ur biz associates or a new date....current date even . A must try for steak lover.
4
We had dinner at this restaurant and it was OK. Food was fresh, atmosphere good. We were looking for exceptional as it advertises the best in steak and we had also eaten at the one in Hong Kong. Could not fault the food but did not leave us with the idea that we must return next time we are in Singapore
4
If you are looking for top notch steaks, this isn't quite the place but if you like good steaks at a relatively good price, then yes, this place fits the bill.We had the jumbo lump crab cake, which deserves a two thumbs up. Very simply flavoured without overpowering the fresh crab meat - delightful combinations of subtlety - good stuff! Steaks - we tried both the Australian Black Angus as well as the USDA Prime Beef. Both were good, but the USDA Prime Beef is definitely superior with a much more succulent and juicy bite. Both were done the way we liked it and I am particularly pleased with the fact that the steak does not come swimming in sauce. Sauces (and they provide all 4 for the table) are on the side. Is it the best steak we have ever tasted in Singapore? Not quite. But at the price of $65 - $75 for a 12 ounce steak, the quality we received made it a place we would come back again to. The ambience is also nice and quiet, great for business meetings or family meals. Done in a woody interior, it also provides a view of the Padang area if you get a window seat. Do note they have a set lunch which seemed pretty reasonable at $38. Service - pretty good, a little on the casual side but by no means poor. Definitely attentive, polite and warm. All in all, it makes this a nice steakhouse to come back for return visits
5
This is place quite expensive during dinner but lunch is good! $36 for dory fish, oysters, cake... $38 for steak, soup, cake. Definitely good place for business lunch. Service is very good and ambience is classy.
4
Ahh cannot say enough about the Ribeye steak so juicy and nice, Had the New Zealand stake and enjoyed it. Normally i am biased towards USDA beef, but this was an awesome steak. awesome time and meal. Wine was also quite good, the Australian shiraz
3
We each had an appetizer , steaks and 3 glasses of wine between us. The total bill was over $350. We don't mind paying if the quality is high. The quality of this food didn't justify the price though.Appetizers (oysters and med salad) were good. French and well presented.The steaks - we're ok but only ok. They were cooked properly but very salty. The meat wasn't flavorful and the salt overwhelmed everything. Creamed spinach - also too much salt. Service - mixed. Great start but we had to twice ask for our drinks.Ambience - ok. Nothing special
3
Ambience in restaurant - it isn't the type of high end restaurant Where u expect proper attire etc. People were wearing T-shirt, berm, sandals. It is noisy too, if you've been to Morton's you will know. Near the entrance has a bar, pretty relax area. Food- Onion soup for starter, Which was not fantastic. Main, I had medium rare ribeye. Doneness was OK but would preferred it to be more charred and it has 4 types of sauces to go with. Sides -baked potato,was Hugh and texture just nice. Sauteed mushrooms were nothing fantastic too.Dessert - hot larva cake w vanilla ice cream. 1 of my favourite dessert so is extremely particular. The flour is too thick, chocolate is not chocolatey enough.Overall, service was good but wouldn't return
5
Read reviews about this steakhouse and decided to venture into new territory for a birthday dinner. The reservations team replied my online reservation within an hour, together with a confirmation of my special requests. For starters, we tried the Sauteed Garlic Prawns with Lobster Bisque. Ooo, it was a lovely combination with light garlic flakes for that additional spark. Steaks were top notch! I had the Australian grain-fed Ribeye while my husband opted for the US version. Both steaks were succulent and done to perfection. We opted for Mashed Potatoes and Creamy Corn for sides which were great complementary sides to our steaks. We ended with the Hot Lava Chocolate Cake which was oozing with hot warm fudge on the insides, and not forgetting that lovely touch of birthday wishes and a candle with the cake. Service was great and non-intrusive. This was our first outing to Wooloomooloo and it's definitely not going to be the last
5
We had a great dinner at the Woolloomoo restaurant - even though we walked in at 9 pm and was the last group to leave.The fillet mignon was perfect - medium and pink in the middle - soft and juicy. My colleague had salmon and it was excellent. Our side dishes were outstanding. On the recommendation of the waiting staff we ordered the chocolate cake - a real winner and highly recommended. Overall, a very good meal to be remembered. The staff were very friendly and rounded off a great dining experience
3
Made reservations for husband's birthday dinner. They asked for his name to be spelled out so that it could be displayed on te b day dessert. Steak was amazing, appetizers, dessert, wine, we followed the suggestion of staff and was not disappointed! Main server was pushy on making suggestions and seemed to rush us to make up our mind. Another server walked by our table twice with our food and took it to two different wrong tables before finding ours. At desert time, There was NO birthday dessert for my husband!! They had forgotten :( its the little touches that differentiates a restaurant and they failed that here. Food was amazing but so are many other restaurants in Singapore these days. It's really too bad as their food is good.
5
As it was going to be a birthday dinner, I called and made a reservation a week (!) before the actual date so as to ensure a table at the window with a great view as I read from the other reviews. I was ensured of the reservation and was really looking forward to it.On the actual day I called to check on the exact location and to my big surprise was informed that there was no reservation made for us !! But I was told hesitantly that it shouldn't be a problem that they will still have a table for us. But my request for a window table was most probably not possible. Obviously the disappointment was big and I called back to ask once again as I made the reservation a week in advance. As it was a special occasion I was willing to change venue, but in the end I was assured that we will get a window table. And indeed we were allocated one in the aft area which we presumed was not supposed to be opened as only 2 tables incl ours were occupied while the front area was almost full.The dinner was in 1 word excellent, from the very first bite till the last. No fault could be found with each selection, it was simply awsome ! We had a lovely great dinner and thank you Wooloomooloo for entertaining my request after all
5
Ordered porterhouse, fillet mignon, spanish dried ham, chocolate molten cake all of which are great and especially impressed by the porterhouse tenderness. The kilpatrick oysters were too wet, just not dry enough and the mushroom soup was average. Overall great and price is on the high side
5
I have dine in this restaurant on the 1st July 2013. I must congratulates the restaurant for it good service, great wine selections and steak. They also serve USDA steak and some fish items. I was also made aware that there also can work on vegetarian menu for guests if this kind of dietary needed. Love the dessert. Please make sure to try the Hot Chocolate cake. Very nice. The only thing that could really make the diner day. Add some pre dinner drinks would be my suggestion
5
Wonderful place for steak and wine. Request for a table by the window to complete the dining experience. We didn't manage to get a table by the window... So low score on atmosphere
4
Had dinner at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse last evening. Services from the staffs were great. Friendly and cheerful. Always there when you needed them. Those that I had encountered all had a very pleasant disposition. I had a Salmon Fillet for my main and was advised to have it medium done. It was superb. Fresh and smooth. Presentation looks lovely. Special mention has got to go the the winner of the night. Their signature Chocolate Cake with melted chocolate centre... It was heavenly. I have to thank the chinese lady server who took noticed that I do not consume alcohol as she took the initiative to inform me that the chocolate contained a small amount of alcohol. Thank you for that. I will definitely come back again for more dinner dates
5
Lovely red wine, fantastic steaks including enormous 20 ounce ones. Mostly Australian beef with a token USA offering.Nice location within Swissotel / Fairmont complex. Quiet so you could hear yourself speak, excellent staff and nice d√©cor - quite dark, yet very relaxing.Food was fantastic - not cheap, yet utterly worth it
5
3 of us went for lunch on Saturday and couldn't have been happier with the atmosphere (I was a little concerned given it's location in the Raffles City Shopping Mall) but decor is lovely, with great views. Food was superb, starters delicious and the steaks cooked to perfection. Wine list extensive!! Jack couldn't have taken greater care of us, much appreciated
5
Celebrated a pre-fathers day dinner with my family on 15th Jun. Was immediately impressed with the service of the staff that greeted us. Decor was beautiful with just the right amount of lighting and volume of music. The selection of steaks was what you would typically get at most steak houses. The quality of food was just slightly shy of excellent but I must say that portions more compensated for it. Approx SGD64-75 for a 12oz steak. Suffice to say it was more than I could comfortably put away. One of the things that stood out was the extensive by the glass wine selection which was perfect for my wife as we were not looking at getting a whole bottle. Above all else the service was EXCELLENT. There is a fine line between being over enthusiastic and bothering guests continually to doing it just perfect - just the right amount of attention at just the right times with a smile and strong communication skills. A commendable effort on the part of all those who serviced us that evening. In the meantime, I'm reasonably sure that Lord-lunchalot's post on 16 Jun violates review guidelines... seriously.. bad boy bad
2
Went with friends for dinner and I think it's fiat to say we where all disappointed. Starters where ok at best, steaks where below average and got cold very quickly as did all the side dishes. Service was good but pay up and go to Mortons and get a whole better experience
4
This has been a great addition to the restaurant scene in Singapore. First class steaks at a very decent price are the order of the day. Add in some great starters, a well priced (small) wine list and excellent service and it's a great mix. Also benefits from being one of the few dedicated steak restaurants that are open at lunchtimes.The view either during the day or at night is superb, overlooking the central CBD and Raflles Place, the only gripe is the perennial Singapore problem of the toilets being situated outwith the restaurant which sells diners short somewhat. Just something you have to put up with
5
We had both a lunch and a dinner (without reservations) at Wooloomooloo Steakhouse while we were staying at Swissotel the Stamford (no relationship, so can't charge the bill to your hotel room). We sat by the windows both times. We recommend the lobster bisque (large chunks of lobster meat) and the 10 oz. filet mignon. The filet was a bit more dry than we are used to, but they provide 4 different kids of sauces. We really enjoyed talking with the tall maitre D', and we overheard people at the next table complimenting him. The Maitre D' went to find a botrytis wine by the glass for us and came back with Heggie's botrytis Semillon which was delicious. They called it a "house wine" and charged S$17. We were very full, but we tried a cr√®me brulee for dessert. It was delicious, as well. We enjoyed the bread which was a white round loaf with onions on it. It was an unexpected and delicious late lunch with a nice view during the rain. At about 7 pm the next night, we were welcomed as familiar old friends, and we we were given a table by the window. We had another glass of the Semillon and ordered lobster bisque and barramundi. They split the lobster bisque into two bowls. The barramundi came on a flat plate with some tomato sauce around it. It was a bit dry. We ordered the bread pudding, and it was quite delicious with sauce and ice cream. The supervisor gave us a sherry from Spain bottled by Lustau. It was a Pedro Ximinez grape, very sweet and thick and fortified. The service was very good, and the staff were all friendly. We thought we left some eyeglasses at the table, and I returned the next morning to meet a very charming lady who helpfully phoned our hotel room to let us know she could not find the glasses. We recommend the filet mignon, lobster bisque, and bread pudding. An excellent value

This was my third visit to Wooloomooloo. My husband is a regular client when he is in Singapore every month. On this occasion our daughters were with us. We were greeted by the charming Jack who seated us in the separate private dining area in the centre of the restaurant. I had the Apple Martini which was fabulous. Our daughters had wine and a cocktail and then we went onto the wine. We all had steaks which were simply out of this world. We had veggies and french fries also and we loved the little pots of the different sauces which we could all try. The selection of mustards is brilliant too. The deserts are stunning...my youngest daughter could not decide between the warm chocolate cake which Jack recommended and the cheesecake. In the end she decided on the chocolate cake which takes 15 minutes to bake. Imagine our surprise when Jack presented Jenny with a cheesecake on a plate with 4 forks for us to eat while she was waiting for the hot chocolate cake. The cheesecake was delicious. But the warm chocolate cake was unlike any desert we have ever tried. Stunningly good.We enjoyed our meal so much. We had been in Malaysia for 5 days and a few days before that in Singapore and we all agreed that this meal was the best meal we have ever had anywhere in the world. And that really is saying something.The service is outstanding. The food is outstanding. The wine selection is outstanding. If you want all of this and a Manager who is charming and friendly, then visit this steak house and put yourselves in the capable hands of Jack. You will not be disappointed

We planned to visit Wooloomooloo Singapore after enjoying superb steak at Wooloomooloo Prime in Kowloon, Hong Kong a few months ago. (I'm surprised to realise that I didn't write a review of that visit as it was surely an excellent experience.)Without a reservation at the Singapore Wooloomooloo, we were greeted by a tall and gracious Maitre D' who assured us of a table. We opted first to enjoy cocktails in the bar but were quite disappointed with the drinks and the service. In Hong Kong they serve a perfect and very generous Dry Martini, here in Singapore the "Wooloomooloo Signature Martini" tasted like watery apple juice with no hint of the Vodka it was advertised to contain. My partner‚Äôs ‚ÄúMango Martini‚Äù was equally bland. Our complaints were greeted by a simple shrug from the waiter, no apology, no action taken.On to the happy story of the steaks, in Wooloomooloo tradition these, Australian Rib-Eye and Filet, were perfect, tender, juicy and perfectly cooked to our liking, a real treat to the palate. I am not a big fan of sauces with steak, I prefer the taste of the unadorned meat but for those who enjoy sauce a selection of four are served at every table. A huge serving of French Fries was our choice of sides. Not much else to say about it, this is a steakhouse and they serve excellent steak.The service at the meal was marred by a surly and brusque head waiter who slammed water glasses down on our table with hardly a glance at us when we declined to order wine. We found his manner distracting throughout our meal. His brusque attitude caught up with him at an adjacent table as he sent a bowl of food crashing to the floor not paying proper attention to the job. This in contrast to the simple wait staff who were courteous, careful and prompt and to the Maitre D‚Äô who went out of his way to show us that our custom was appreciated.The cost, although high, was not much of a shock to us as we are getting accustomed to increasingly expensive Singapore. Food-wise, Wooloomooloo is perfect, a big improvement in their service and bar would make them unbeatable in Singapore
5
Truly a great steakhouse. It is modern, sleek and stylish. It's not trying to create the feel of Morton's (which is a great old school layout) and it doesn't have the feel of Cut. But it was a fantastic steak, which was reasonable value compared to the competition. The meat was cooked much better than the meal I had at Cut two months ago, and the prices more reasonable. The most similar setup I have been to in Singapore was Bedrock, but for convenience I would go back to Wooloomooloo first. My mouth is watering now, just writing this review
5
Superb service, knowledgable staff, warm atmosphere and great food. What more does one need????
Wife had a seafood salad and I the T Bone (porterhouse). The best I have ever had!!
5
Our night started out bad until we found the Wooloomooloo Steakhouse. The staff and management went out of their way from the time we walked in the door until we walked out the door. The food,service and ambiance of this restaurant was superb. We can't wait till our next visit to Singapore.

We were suppose to have dinner at another restaurant called 7Adams which turned out to be a complete disaster. They had a private event that evening and they did not call to inform us that our booking has to be postponed or cancelled. There were 15 hungry and angry people standing outside the restaurant and we have to make a quick decision on where to go since it was the holiday season (2012) and everything would be crowded. I remember going to Wooloomooloo for lunch with some clients. The service was awesome, great steaks and ambiance. I called the manager Jack to check if he could take our reservations in such short notice. He said they were almost full for the evening but will call me in a few mins. A few minutes later, Jack called and said he has a table arranged for us and we headed that way. From an awful night, it turned into a wonderful gathering of friends, laughter, good food, wonderful service and we forgot about the horrible experience at 7Adams. We did not regret the decision of going back to Wooloomooloo. Thank you all for making our night so wonderful

This was my 2nd visit for dinner and I would say their steak was as good. We ordered a 10oz fillet, 12oz portersteak and a tomahawk for all 5 people. Had 3 sides and that was enough for all of us. We also ended up having 2 desserts. The deserts were smaller portion compared to Ruth Chris Steakhouse but they were good. This time round, the service was also good too. I will be back for more in future and perhaps will try their restaurant in hong kong too

This is a great place for quiet dinner for two. Hospitality: The service was attentive and delightful. Food: The jumbo crab appetizer, served cold, was fresh and tasty. For mains we had the aged Tomahawk. It was done perfectly medium rare and the bone of the steak was almost the length of my forearm! I like aged beef and I think they did a pretty good job. I even cleaned up the bone. For sides we had the Cream Corn, Mashed Potatoes and Spinach, and we enjoyed them all. The waiter suggested we end the dinner with a Chocolate dessert, and it was a good call. We left feeling stuffed and happy. The whole experience was well worth the price

We were there in April and had the Citibank Gourmet dining deal. The 4 course set lunch was $48++ w/o wine paring. The appetiser of crab cake, grilled asparagus and egg benedict was a great start to the meal. Followed by mushroom soup laced with truffle oil - heavenly!. The main course was a nice well charred steak that melts in your mouth accompanied by a watercress salad and cajun potatoes. I think a simple roast potato would have been a better choice but I am just nit picking. To end the fab meal was a chocolate dessert. Coffee and tea were additonal charges but it was a great end to a great meal.Service was attentive, food was good and the price was value for money. I am definitely coming back here again soon. The restaurant has a great view of the padang to boot and I am sure it is most romantic in the evening

This is my second posting on TripAdvisor about Wooloomooloo in Singapore and I have to rave about my experience once again because it was truly a fantastic one!We were there for a business dinner and we were also introducing Singapore to a new co-worker. He was craving steak and after my other experiences being so wonderful at Wooloomooloo, we decided to book last minute and take him and his wife there. Everyone had fantastic appetizers, I recommend the Jumbo Shrimp as it was uber-fresh! We all of course had steak for our mains which again was cooked to perfection and all of the sides we ordered complimented our main courses very well. Why we keep going back to Wooloomooloo is not only the fantastic food but also the extremely above average and attentive service. We had three bottles of wine all recommended to us and each bottle was absolutely delicious! We stayed after dinner and enjoyed drinks in the bar which gave our new co-worker a gorgeous view of Marina Bay Sands. We will continue to dine at Wooloomooloo for business dinners and also date nights and I have recommended the restaurant to many friends who have also shared with me how wonderful both the service and food is here

Went for lunch. Wanted to have the executive set but as the last weekend was World Gourmet Summit they only offered a 4 course set for $48. Started with a crab salad with a poached egg. The egg looked fantastic but the taste did not stand out. Next was a mushroom soup with truffle oil. I liked this but my mates felt it was too creamy. The main was a beautiful filet mignon steak with some fries and salad. Sides were puny but the steak itself a good size. Dessert was chocolate marquise, very dense rich chocolate, with some custard to cut the richness. Overall the meal was pretty good. As the waiter spilled our water when delivering the mains they comped us some asparagus with bearnaise sauce. What can I say about the service. It was quite attentive in that water was constantly refilled and the waitstaff knew our orders. On the other hand, sloppy delivery with the water spillage. It was pure carelessness on his part as he came by later to (literally) slop our mustard for us. Also the bill took a long time to come and there were errors in the bill. So I think service is very much a WIP and retraining would help. Especially Mr. Sloppy. If they can improve service this will be a much higher calibre restaurant

Despite the spectacular view of the city, I've regretted dining in with my client. Worse hospitality and poor quality of steak. I doubt its the same in hong kong. Money and time spent just went down the drain. Expectations were higher when I read those recent reviews about how great this place is
5
Found the service to be excellent and this started as soon as we walked into the restaurant. Had a 10 minute wait on the balcony with drinks before being shown to our table. The views were superb at night of Marina Bay & the Financial District. Our waiter was both attentive and knowledgeable and guided us through the menu and wine list. I had the Langoustine in Lobster Bisque which was superb and so tasty followed by an equally fine T Bone. Couldn't even manage desert which says a lot for the quality of the food. So impressed that I made a reservation afterwards to their Hong Kong restaurant which I visited 5 days later.This was a high quality restaurant and left both of us feeling quite special. Not a cheap place to eat so remember to pack your credit card

I'm going to cut short this review. The food was okay but not great. The staffs need more attentive for their service. Ambience and view save the day...
5
The food is excellent, as and the service is at par with it. But make sure you wear a jumper if you are sitting at any of the tables near the wall, as you will be sitting underneath blades of air staight from the Arctic.

I know this restaurant because I also visited same restaurant in Hongkong. The steak was superb... best in Singapore !!!!
5
Wonderful service, great product knowledge and attention to service and exceptional food, would highly recommend this restaurant for western style food in Singapore. One of my best restaurant experiences!

I was excited with the prospect of trying a new steak restaurant. All I can say now is that I know where not to get steaks in Singapore...We booked under a group; upon arriving we told the hostess our group name and we were told that we were the first to arrive. When seated we pointed out that they were missing a place setting. The hostess initially suggest that she could add a place setting at the end of the table but this would over crowd the table. After a fair bit of debate the hostess said that she would go look for another table. 10 minutes later a different staff member showed up to tell us that there were no more table and that we would have to make do. Unhappy with the decision we asked for cocktails and preceded to wait for the remainder of our party. After waiting another 10 minutes the original hostess arrived and said that they had plenty of tables in the back and asked us to move. This was mildy annoying as it seemed that the staff were not communicating very well with each other. We gathered our belongings to walk to the new table and low and behold the other half of our party was already seated and waiting for us. When we asked how this could happen we were met with a nonchalant answer and brushed off. So we ended up sitting in separate parts of the restaurant for 20 minutes needlessly.After assembling the group we decided to order. We decided on the "tomahawk" steak and some starters as its meant to be the speciality of the establishment. My starter was the Loberster Bisque and my girlfriend had the onion soup. My soup was luke warm and my girlfriends was stone cold. Oddly our sides arrived next (with the mains)...baked potatoes. Not only were they baked but I can confidently say they were cremated. They were so over cooked that I couldn't event cut them with a steak knife. After several discussions with the manager they were replaced with alternative sides. When our steaks arrived they looked prepared as asked however cutting into them they appeared to be way undercooked. My medium rare was at best "blue" and stone cold in the middle. Again after some discussions with the manager the took the steak away and "cooked" it more. When it showed up the second time the steak was still raw and cold. The manger replaced the steak with a fresh one which eventually was edible. He mentioned that the staff didn't know how to cook this type of steak... disappointing considering it was not only their speciality but also the most expensive steak on the menu.The one thing I can say was that the floor manger seemed compassionate about the issues and tried his very best to fix the problems. Its hard however for one person to cover up all the mistakes made by the rest of the team, so I can not really recommend anybody to this establishment. Save your money and hit one of the other great steak places in Singapore

Went here with a group of friends and had a fantastic meal.All the steak we ordered was superb- tomahawk (huge 1.3kg piece of beef) and porterhouse, as well as top notch sides (french fries and spinach are both highly recommended).They have an extensive wine list and the service was excellent too.The interior was slick and well lit with great views of Marina Bay.You must go

We went to Wooloomooloo for a wine dinner (featuring wines from Torbreck in the Barossa Valley), so it was a 'set menu' event. Jack Fraser and his team at Wooloomooloo were excellent and changing one of the set courses was absolutely no problem at all. The menu had possibly a little too much meat, even for me as a dedicated carnivore, but I shouldn't be surprised when the restaurant is a steakhouse, right? All the food was excellent and was well chosen to pair with the wine. Service was efficient and unobtrusive.Wooloomooloo is a stylish restaurant, well located in the centre of the city in Singapore and very easily accessible. We arrived a little early and were seated in the bar for a leisurely drink and had time to look out over the very pleasant view or to admire the creativity that has gone into designing the place to create a pleasant and welcoming ambience

I am a steak lover and Wooloomooloo was part of a well researched plan for our Singapore visit. We arrived a few minutes after our early reservation and we told the restaurant was not quite open. Not a big deal and we were escorted to the bar were we had a glass of wine while we waited for our table. The wine Cas Lapostolle Cuv√É¬©e Alexandre Merlot 2008, Apalta Vineyard, Colchagua Valley, Chile was excellent. While we waited they brought chocolate covered almonds and later small portions of beef Wellington. The table in the bar afforded a nice view of Singapore that included the Marina Bay Sands, St Andrews Cathedral, the tower skyline, etc.. Nice waiting room.The dinner table was not far from the bar table and afforded the same views. We opted to share the 70-day grain fed young Black Angus beef, 2-3 weeks wet aged Stockyard Farms, Hendra, Queensland -- Tomahawk. This was one of the nicest looking steaks that I have ever been served. Unfortunately, the table was to small for the meal and we had to surrender our candle, bread, and both the water and wine bottles to put the steak and side of creamed spinach on the table.So mismatched was the table and the steak that we sent it back to have the chef slice and debone it. Sad really because it was beautiful. As steaks go, this was a good one and not a great one. I enjoyed it and the portion was generous. If I go again, I think I will try their fillet or the porterhouse. Maybe sharing one of each will be my plan. I will also try and get a table for four for my party of two.The side of spinach was easily big enough for sharing, the bread was good while it lasted. The wine, this time by the bottle was a excellent accompaniment for the steak. The service was very good throughout the evening. The defribulators are kept just out of site when the check is delivered. Fortunately, I did not need them but suffice to say this is a expensive restaurant. I would go back as everything I read says it is the best steak in Singapore. They have a nice menu. I did not have but would love to try their cheese plate for two as a dessert

We often have a good steak in places all over the world. This Steakhouse certainly knows its business. The meat is of first quality, the cooking to order. Sensible winelist and a really nice and warm and helpfull service completes the picture. If you crave for something else than asian food when beeing in Singapore don't miss this one 
5
In the middle of downtown, in an elegant ambient. The menu is full of great dish both of meat and fish. I took a tenderlion, with a glass of red italian wine. Grilled vegetables as side. Service and food at top levels. 60usd italian style espresso included. A great place to be

Booked this after seeing the reviews on TP and no regrets whatsoever. The Maitre d' "Fat Eddie" is a top man! Superb service provided by him and his staff on what was our final night in Singapore. When he found out it was a joint 50th birthday celebration for myself and another of our party, two of the four desserts arrived with candles, happy birthday iced on the plates, a round of happy birthday sung by the waiters and complimentary after-dinner liqueurs too. The steaks were superbly cooked, really good sizes too. Fabulous views across Singapore straight to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, so we could see the night-time laser display whilst eating! Overall, a thoroughly recommended restaurant. It won't be cheap, but you get what you pay for. Nice one Eddie!! :

It's been a while since I went to a steakhouse, and boy was this the right place to break my steak-"fast". A trip to Wooloomooloo has to start with happy hour drinks. Their chocolate martinis are made from good quality chocolate and tastes like the best ice chocolate you've ever had... so much so it's easy to forget how much alcohol is in it. At just $12, it's definitely makes this girl very happy... especially since happy hour lasts till 9pm!We decided to go easy with the starters and had the jumbo crabcake and the prawn cocktail to share. For the mains, we had the Ribeye and Filet Mignon. The Ribeye was good, but what I really loved was the Filet Mignon - it was cooked so perfectly that it could not be faulted. The sauces that came with the steaks were the perfect compliment, my favourite being the pepper sauce (way more peppery than I expected but so perfect with the steak!). Service throughout dinner was impeccable, attentive without being intrusive.By the time we finished out steaks, we were way too full to have any desserts and believe me, my girlfriend and I were very disappointed as we heard very good things about their bread and butter pudding. Oh well, another reason to come back. Can't wait till the next time

My boyfriend and I have eaten at Wooloomooloo twice - once in December 2012 and again in January 2013. Both times absolutely did NOT disappoint and it is our favourite place for a consistently good steak, excellent service and a great night out. Even though it is probably a little pricier than other places, it is definitely value for money. We shared the Tomahawk (the massive 1.2kg steak!) on our first try, and it was a novel experience. It was cooked a little too rare toward the bone but I imagine that a steak that size would be VERY difficult to cook to perfection. On our second trip back, we ordered a steak of our own each and it was perfect. I love the accompaniment of steak sauces with each order, and the mash potato is to die for! Buttery and fluffy and smooth... you absolutely HAVE to order this when you go. :)Our favourite appetizers were the jumbo crab lumps and french onion soup. More examples of simple things done right. That being said, you could probably eat just the entire wheel loaf of complimentary focaccia bread that is served at the very start of your meal, and go home a vey happy and contented diner. Delicious.The best part of our experience was the complimentary cake they brought out, along with my boyfriend's name written on the plate in chocolate sauce for his birthday! They took a photo of us together, and actually printed it out, placed it in a birthday card and gave it to us! Such an excellent bit of personal service and we have kept the photo and card until now. Thank you for providing us with such a wonderful experience! We can't wait to b back :

My wife and I went to celebrate her birthday. Read the reviews and thought we would try it.Service: When I made the reservation they said "no window seats available", and that was OK. However when we did arrive we were given a small table in the entry corner, right next to another couple....despite numerous other tables with more room available. I assumed they were full and given our late reservation the other tables were reserved, WRONG! About a half hour after we arrived the other tables remain empty, and they reset the table next to us and immediately seat a single guy eating by himself....so much for any private conversation! As the night went on, still empty tables but we are relegated to the poor table. Other than that, service good, but not amazing.Steak: Was very good and perfectly done. It's the only thing saving this place from a really poor rating.Value: FORGET IT. $350 for an evening of indifferent service, sitting next to strangers in a half empty restaurant, with average size portions, and very expensive drinks.Think twice, unless your curious, and believe this was a fluke. We are not coming back
5
My fiancee & I have eaten at Wooloomooloo twice over the last nine months. The first occasion was the night of our engagement, and second last Friday for my Birthday dinner. The experience on both occasions was superb. They remembered us from our previous visit which was a really nice touch. The steaks are perfect, as is the broccoli & roasted potatoes (which are enormous!). The wine list is extensive and we had a wonderful bottle of Australian red to complement the read meat selection. Service is very attentive, almost at a standard unknown in Singapore. But my favourite aspect of the restaurant is the ambience, with a lovely view over the city, where the decor is very homely as a result you can speak to the person next to you without having to yell, as is often the case in local restaurants where diners are squeezed into as many seats as possible. Overall, one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore and we will certainly be back
5
We ate there twice during our visit...first time on our own..and then again with 2 other friends...on both occasions the attention was superb..food excellent..but is very expensive compared to european prices. there were 4 of us for dinner one night...3 starters, 4 main courses, no deserts, 2 bottles of wine and the bill was 740 sing dollars....that is around 385 sterling...so not cheap...but the atmosphere is great and the manager is absolutely charming....english guy and he has worked in lots of hotels all over the world and you can tell.....his service is impeccable
5
This is a top notch restaurant. The place was nicely decorated and quiet, and the service was excellent. The staff was very friendly and attentive. But, most importantly, the steak was of top quality. I had the prime ribeye. It was large, tender, and juicy. Lots of wine to choose from

We chose wooloomooloo based on the trip advisor reviews.We arrived and were served by what I can only call a "distracted" waiter... He seemed always to be in a hurry to be somewhere else, pushed for us to make a decision on food and when the starters arrived they were mediocre. Not the best experience.Then the manager appeared and everything changed... The wine arrived, the food arrived and everyone was suddenly interested and attentive.The meal was great, the food excellent and we decided that the initial experience was a blip...Then... We were offered complementary after dinner drinks "on the house".My wife declined and I said that a brandy would be nice...We subsequently watched the brandy I had asked for be delivered to a person on the next table who clearly wasn't expecting it. He was very happy. My brandy arrived after we watched the pantomime that ensued following the realisation that it had been wrongly delivered. All was fine with the world...Until...(And this part is a little bit my fault)... We looked at the bill when we were back in our hotel.Hmmmm... They had charged us $S45 for the complementary brandy... Just a sheer lack of communication.If the manager wasn't there I imaging it would be a complete disaster... Bottom line - good food shame about the staff

I have been eating Asian food for more than one week, so I was willing to eat something more "European",I went to the Wooloomooloo steakhouse based on other users recommendations.I had to say that this was one of the best (and enjoyable) piece of meat I have ever eaten,The Wooloomooloo steak served with cajun spice was cooked to perfection (medium rare, as requested).Fries were also very good.Would definitively recommend.Expect to pay +/- 100 SG$ per person (meat + side + water and glass of wine), but this worths it
5
A couple of business collegues and I decided we needed a steak after multiple Asian meals...and stumbled on Wooloomooloo when returning to our hotel.The meal was excllent and the service, with a small qualifier, also excllent. We enjoyed the atmosphere which was busy and the clean lines of the decor.The hicup was that our main meals were getting late...but the manager, Jack Frasier, noticed our wait, personally followed up with the kitchen and refilled our wine in consolation for the delay. Nice gesture but it was his alertness that was impressive.We will definately return
2
We booked valentines day dinner for the night. we paid $350 for 4 cours dinner.Food service was almost nill. Very dissapointed with quality and service.
What a waiste!
5
I've been here twice and each time, have had incredible experiences.
Thes steaks are mouth-watering here, service is impeccable, and Noel, the manager is one of the most affable restaurant managers I've met.
The steaks are so good I ate mine without the sauces provided.
5
Valentines Day 2013 and I'm so glad that my boyfriend surprised me with dinner at Wooloomooloo. These guys are absolutely fabulous. It was our second time to the restaurant and they actually remembered both of us!!! How do they do it??? They're so nice! The manager came over at the end of the dinner and bought us a round of drinks to say thank you to us for supporting them. Seriously, never happened to us before. The little touches with the photo frame and the pictures that they took of us when we arrived were just wonderful. Absolutely first class! The valentines menu was delicious and generous. We struggled to finish our food a little towards the end but it was worth the room in our tummies. Till next time

Hailing from the great state of Texas, we began our search for a good steak restaurant in Singapore after our relocation in May. We have been to Mortons, Cut, Salt Grill, Prime Society and Wooloomooloo (twice). It's our steak restaurant of choice, for several reasons. First of all, the service is top notch, and what you would expect in a restaurant of this caliber. The other restaurants' service was good, but Wooloomooloo goes above and beyond to ensure that dining there becomes a "dining experience." Immediately upon our return, Jayzee (sp?) remembered us and asked my husband if he wanted the double-cut ribeye again. Through-out the meal, Eddie, assisted in making sure our food, wine, etc. was to our satisfaction, but without being over intrusive. After dinner, we had an after drink in their bar, and the general manager, Noel, introduced himself, and also followed up with regard to our experience there. So, in short, our service was fantastic, again for the second time. Food is great. No, it's not the same cut of prime angus beef I can get for $30 in the US, but the flavor and cut is exceptional for SIngapore. In our opinion, we get our money's worth here, and that's why we will continue to go back when we are craving steak

Last time we were there was in November 2012, and the Australian rib eye was so good. This time, on the recommendation of the restaurant manager, we had the US prime beef rib eye and it was even better ....mmmm.. melts in the mouth. We decided to go straight to the mains and ordered a side dish of buttered mushrooms to share. The 10-oz steaks came with four sauces - au jus, pepper, red wine, mushroom - all very good.The wine we chose to go with the steaks was a Malbec......lovely and reasonably priced compared to the others in the wine list. Since we were quite full, we shared a dessert....quite sinful. Service was excellent. Commendations to Noel, Jack, and Eddy
4
Even though the restaurant is located in a mall and connected to a hotel you will feel comfortable with a nice and proper "restaurant like" ambiance when you enter the corner. Food is very nice, selections of drinks and desserts are very tempting. But what is the most impressive I have experienced is service. Three gentlemen who took turn to take care of our table which had only me and a friend were all professional, helpful and friendly. Please keep it up
5
We came here as a special family treat. We were given a great table with an excellent view of Singapore at night. The restaurant is nicely designed, up market, yet comfortable and welcoming. Special mention to "Fat Eddie" who was particularly attentive, professional and friendly.We ordered 20oz Rib-eyes on the advice of Fat Eddie, as our teenage boys were particularly hungry! The steaks were cooked to perfection. The fries were hot and salty and I can also recommend the creamy spinach. Although full to bursting a this stage, we then had desert, with my personal favourite bread & butter pudding! Delicious!In all a wonderful evening, great food, great service, great ambience and then Eddie presented us with personalised cards with photos of our evening. Yes , it is expensive, but we will definitely return! Well done Fat Eddie, who really gets what Front of House service should be about. Singapore, take note

We dined here during our stay at the Swissotel, right next door. We were a party of 7, 4 adults and children 7, 4 and 2. Rocked up on Saturday night, no booking, just on chance that we might get in. The manager couldn't fit us together in the restaurant part, so he organised to convert an area of the bar area for us. This was quite comfortable and we were very impressed with his obliging efforts. Having lived for many years in Asia I would never normally order western food, as they generally do oriental food so much better. But I had read that this restaurant was different, and they didn't let me down. I had the steak. It was one of the more enjoyable meals we experienced during our holiday, and we had some wonderful meals.The grandchildren were made to feel special and all the adults commented on how pleasant the evening was
5
My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful New Years Eve 2012, thanks to the amazing management of this superb Steak Restaurant, diverse in all other areas, lending itself to a fabulous menu, even amended to suit a hard shell allergy, which was so appreciated. Our steaks were heaven! Astounding views of the Fireworks Display, but still not able to outshine the great staff and their service. My friend on our recommendation has already booked for Valentines and we are hoping our daughter and son in law will dine there in March, celebrating our son in laws Birthday.Thank You Mooloomooloo, we will be back.J & B Williams.

It was our first year celebrating New Year's in Singapore together and wanted a delicious dinner, amazing views, and a fabulous atmosphere, Wooloomooloo was just the place! We were seated at a fantastic table with views of downtown and Marina Bay Sands. The service was impeccable and staff was clearly on their toes for all their New Years guests. I especially liked how present the manager was on the floor making sure every guest was attended to and enjoying their meals.I have had a difficult time finding amazing steak in Singapore, I'm super picky. I finally found Filet Mignon on the menu and it was out of this world amazing and cooked to perfection. I was thrilled to find a steak place that really delivers amazing steak that makes me feel like I'm back in Manhattan. We will surely be returning and I recommend Wooloomooloo for not only special occasions but after dinner drinks or a nice Friday night dinner.
5
I have visited this restaurant for a good and quality cuisine and enjoyed stayed there. Despite this is a steak house, I have tried jumbo prawns cocktail and crab soup and was happy with the quality and taste of the dishes.They have very good view from the windows and I enjoyed being there.Next time will try steak :
5
It used to be difficult to find good steaks in Singapore but now we are luckily having more choices.One significant standout is Wooloomooloo. We heard about it from friends and went as we like a nice piece of red meat. While not expecting too much we were pleasantly surprised in pretty much all aspects. We started out with the Woolomooloo salad, a nice combination of leaves, filet mignon, palm hearts and truffles. For the main we were enjoying the Tomahawk steak which is amazingly tender and juicy and great to share. The side dishes are all good quality, especially fries and the creamed spinach. Out of a selection of four steak sauces we liked the pepper sauce best. The waiters are very attentive and helped us with a nice selection of wines. Especially Jayzee seems to be a great guy. We finished off with a lava cake that we just couldn't get enough off. We had great fun and have signed up for the membership card. Great value for money
5
Perfect venue to celebrate special occasions. New Year's Eve set menu was perfectly planned and as usual, the food was never a disappointment. Perfectly sized and beautifully presented. The staff were all friendly and very good in what they do. Decor was nicely done with black and gold themed helium balloons floating on the ceiling and New Year party packs on each table. Wooloomooloo definitely pays attention to even the smallest details. In addition to that, Wooloomooloo is the perfect place to view the fireworks. A perfect place to end 2012 & usher to the New Year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
5
Wooloomoloo - Food was fabulous Incredibly Flavorful and beautifully presented. They had a fixed menu for New years Eve. My wife had been sick the day before and did not feel like having a full 6 course dinner. We explained the situation to the manager on duty, Mr. Frazier, and he immediately worked with my wife to find something acceptable that she could order. He continued to check on us throughout the evening. We had a wonderful time - great food and a great atmosphere. Senior management should be very proud of the entire staff who all were helpful and had a great attitude in serving the customer. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
4
The atmosphere, greeting, table location was all great. The staff were friendly and jovial with strong menu knowledge. The wine list has good diversity and is well suited to the restaurant. Our entire party ordered steaks and one was under-cooked despite a repeated request that it must be medium well with no blood...when it arrived it was medium rare and bloody. The mistake was rectified but the rest of the group had almost finished their meals by the time the correctly cooked steak returned. Not what I would expect at this price point. Also the toilets for the restaurant are the shopping center public toilets and far from spotless, again below expectation for this price point. All in all we had a very pleasant evening with just a couple of annoyances
5
It's the place for the best steaks in town. Plus good service atmosphere and view of the marina. The wines are very good value for money but wish they add more burgundies as i prefer them anytime over the rest. Though I know it's not a steakhouse thing.I am coming back for NYE dinner which I think I a good value for money.
4
I can definitely recommend this restaurant for their steaks and wines. I ordered the 12-oz Rib Eye (Australian Black Angus) for S$62, which was cooked to perfection (i like mine medium-well) and it tasted really good from the first bite. The 4 sauces and side dishes were good as well. My wife had the scallops wrapped in bacon for a starter, which she didn't like at all (rubbery and tasteless). However, the other dishes and friendly & attentive service really made up for it. The free birthday cake and photo was a nice touch, so overall, it was a great experience!! Considered this steak place over Mortons and CUT because of better value and view of Singapore skyline
5
This has to be one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Great steaks, tremendous ambiance and terrific bar. The owner is Colin Smith, a Kiwi, who has opened the same establishments in Hong Kong. The staff are knowledgeable, courteous and respectful. What more do you want from a restauran

Had a wonderful time in Wooloomooloo Singapore!Brought my family there for dinner yesterday. I booked the table at 730pm but due to bad traffic at Orchard road, we were delayed. I called the restaurant to say that we are going to be late and Mr Noel Emmanuel who was the manager responded immediately and kept the table for us without any hassle. We were greeted by the friendly staff and restaurant manager; Mr Noel Emmanuel almost immediately upon our arrival. We were simply delighted.Beautiful scenery and wonderful starters. Had the fillet mignon done medium rare myself and it was delicious! Juicy and tasty! My family had the other specialties like salmon and barramundi and it was simply awesome! We ordered some desserts and they were excellent! The chocolate cake and lemon and lime pie was superb! My sisters loved them! The staff were very attentive and responds promptly whenever we were ready to make our orders. Service was very good.Overall, we had a good time together! My family loved the food and atmosphere. We will definitely return for another meal soon!!Cheer

Sumptuous food, excellent wine selection and such great hospitality. I love the vibe and best of all, it's so reasonably priced! Definitely heading back again. The beef Wellington is a Must Try!

Our first visit to this restaurant based on recommendations on Trip Advisor - we weren't disappointed! The food was excellent and the service was amongst the best we have ever received!

I read so much about that restaurant that i wanted to try.Walked in the place a Saturday for lunch, .no staff at the entrance i walk to bar no staff. The place must be closed, but finally a person came to great me. The place was almost empty, only one table. The place was noisy from a private party in the back. Ordered filet mignon medium well, 58 $Sing plus service charge plus taxes, vegetables 12 Sing$ extra, but the silverware is on the table free of charge. Filet was served medium rare, I requested it to have it cooked medium well came back medium. Mistake can happen but not at 80 Sin$. I asked to speak to the general manager Mr Emmanuel (he was too busy with the party, did not even dare coming) i saw him walk by a few times but never even acknowledge me. I was so disappointed that i did not even finished my meal, and just ordered an espresso. Total 91.90 $sing. The nice server apologized.I was hopping for a gesture, nothing when i left i saw Mr Emmanuel standing by the bar his arm crossed talking to his staff , Rip Off , poor manager he just did not care, maybe I was alone and did not order any wine, not worth his time

A lavish setting, made up of leather,dark wood and dim lightings, creating the right ambience for casual get-together or even formal gatherings. The first thing however that caught my eye is the view. I suggest you get there in the early evening, before the sun sets, that way you are able to capture both day and night views, both sublime. We were greeted by the general manager Noel, and his ever ready to please attitude caught my attention despite having to accomodate our requests for table change 3 times!! Of course his crew follow suit, giving sincere service. Our glasses were never left empty, shows that the service crew were consistently attentive. Compliments to the head chef, Kent for the gratifying food served. Presentation is classy, just like the ambience. All our steaks were perfectly done to just what we requested for. The variety of sauces served on the side allows the diner to savor the succulent piece of meat however they fancy. Would definitely return, Wooloomooloo has our votes for the 'hippest' steakhouse in town! Martin & Angi

We really enjoyed our celebrationary meal here recently.Nice ambience, not pretentious, terrific service, friendly but not hovering.The steaks were terrific, very tender and perfectly cooked.The side dishes were ordinary, frankly, not worthy of their price.Nice homemade bread is served with the meal, terrific.A nice glassy of Shiraz to go with the meal, why not?Desert was just ok.Coffee was good. All in all, a very enjoyable meal, excellent service!Pricey? Yes, Worth it? Mmmmmmm Yes, Why not

Quite a hidden gem, Wooloomoolo is my new favourite steakhouse! Went with a bunch of old-time girlfriends, ended up sharing 5 starters between the 4 of us cos we just couldnt choose when it all sounded so good. Notable highlighlights was the jumbo crabcake & tartar with avocado, perfect way to start the meal! Next up, the Tomahawk steak (char grilled on the outside, yet still tender and juicy) & Beef Wellington which was done to perfection...we finished off with the molten chocolate cake, yums! What made the experience many notches higher was having a team of service staff who were attentive without being intrusive, cracking jokes & making us feel like we were having a meal in their home, obvious that they take pride in what they do. A must go

Was there for lunch with a colleague. Not much of a beef person actually but I must say that the steak (done medium-well) was really flavorful and succulent; serving was generous enough for sharing between the two of us! Also enjoyed the bread and butter pudding very much, vanilla ice-cream is smooth and the "bread" itself is moist and buttery without being cloying. Service staff are dedicated and attentive; service is warm and impeccable. Cosy ambience with a great view of the skyline; perfect place to unwind

Stumbled upon this place while shopping and didn't have a single clue what this restaurant is all about.And so, below are unbiased comments.Food: Steak is really good and is on a generous serving. Apart from their steaks, everything is a rip-off. The side dishes should pretty much be left "a-side". The other dishes seem to be just an afterthought. Really disappointing given how pricey they are.Service: You could tell the waiters are very inexperienced, not to mention how much they get paid for their jobs. And one waiter actually mixed my glass of sparkling water with tap water. Ambience: Overall interior is good. Music is too pretentious and confusing.Price: We didn't get a wine, and I still think the price we got for a dinner for two is too pricey for what we got

Had a great dining experience at Wooloomooloo. The steaks are probably the best I've had in Singapore. I have also recommended several friends including my boss, and they all agree that the food is truly excellent. I would recommend the USDA Prime Rib Eye and the Beef Wellington. These are both excellent. The crab cakes are delightful; the salads are also very good but I have a sof spot for the desserts. I have been back several times for just coffee and desserts. My favourites are the souffle which is awesome, and the bread and butter pudding. I know the bread pudding sounds very ordinary but trust me, this is their best dessert. It is served with vanilla ice cream, and it is to die for. The creme brulee is also good but that is something that my wife prefers more than I do. The key lime pie is ok but the chocolate lava cake is very good - if you like that kind of thing. They have a great selection of wines from all over the world. I especially liked Yalumba's, The Cigar Cab Sav from Australia. Excellent value for this award winning wine. They have also an excellent range of champagne from Pol Roger to Dom Perignon. I've invited some friends here for cocktails and happy hour (good value at $12 a cocktail), and the drinks were excellent. Recommend the Lychee Rouge which is very unusual and delectable. The best thing about this place is that they are not stingy with the liquor. They serve pretty stiff drinks here rather than the watered down cocktails you get elsewhere. At least, you don't feel jipped for the price that you pay!The service is also very good - top class in fact. They are attentive but not intrusive, and definitely not push. They guide you along to the choices that suit you especially in ordering the wines. They have a magnificent view of the city although they are on the third floor of the Swisshotel. If you are big F1 fan, this is the place to watch the race. They have a view of the straight coming from the Supreme Court all the way past the Swisshotel. It's the perfect place for every occasion from anniversary's to even big office parties. The bar is a nice place to hang out with friends. If you have a big group, try out the long table at the bar. Very nice. All in all - a welcome addition to the restaurant scene in Singapore

We come across this place on our last eveing before flying home. Although this limited our drink intake we stil eat far to much. A very good all round steak house at reasonable prices for Singapore and totally outstanding service. The photo at the end was a lovely touch presented in a card. The duty manger with the goatee beard was excellent ( sorry didn't catch his name)For me I can't go wrong here. Topped of a good trip with a hig

New favourite restaurant in Singapore!Very cozy ambience and personalized service. Most importantly,one of the best Beef Wellington that i've ever tasted!! Layered with mushrooms,parma ham and FOIE GRAS. A MUST TRY! Overall, great dining experience and will definitely go back for more steak!

Upside: Big juicy steaks. Prompt attentive service. Great wines.
Downside: Bland limp salads.
But hey, you're here for meat anyway.
And, if you want to pretend you're Fred Flintstone, order the Tomahawk whole rib with steak. It's a succulent ribeye with a HUGE bone attached!

Decided to try this based on the positive reviews. Asked for the window seat and didn't get it when we arrived. 3 of us shared the starters of fresh oysters and crab cake. The crab cake was quite well done and tasty, the portion a little smaller then I expected for the price. The oysters were disappointing, 2 out of 6 of them had such a tiny bit of flesh it was almost invisible. They either don't get good stock or their chef doesn't check what goes out of the kitchen. They recovered somewhat by replacing the baby oysters. We ordered their piece de resistance, the wagyu tomahawk, all 1.6kg of it. We asked for medium and it came out medium rare or almost rare in the centre, and sent it back. Again I think the chef can do better. We shared the lava chocolate cake and lime pie which were ok. Overall, a $450 meal without wine I think is overrated based on their delivery (or lack thereof) of the seating arrangement, oysters and wagyu tomahaw

I went to have dinner at Wooloomooloo based on a friend's recommendation about how excellent the steaks were and they did not disappoint: It's probably the best meat in town, far ahead of les Bouchons etc... I went there with a few business partners and the atmosphere was just perfect for our discussion. Classy, busy yet not too noisy.Not cheap but I will go again for sure

It was my second visit since my last visit a month ago. Last time I came with my friends for a meal which we enjoyed very much. It was great atmosphere with very good food and service. I wrote a review about it on hungrygowhere. This time around I didn't make a reservation. I had to get some work done on my computer and needed a table for 1. I walked in and hostess recognized me from my last visit!!!! Not my name but still it was great to know they remembered. And when she realized I was alone and working offered me a table by the window at the lounge away from hustle and bustle of the dinning room. Immediately the bartender approached and offered the drinks list. I wish I had come earlier. They have happy hour from 4 to 7pm every day. Selected martini cocktails corona beer spirit at $12. And mini prime beef burgers at $12 as well^^. But I felt like a meal. Happy hour next time! I ordered the chocolate martini from the HH menu. My jumbo lump crab cake was an amazing appetizer. Then I had the USDA Prime rib eye, which was done to perfection. And a side of creamy spinach. I left all my inhibitions aside and treated myself with a warm chocolate cake. It is the most sinfully chocolatey dessert. I wish I had more space. Service was very good too""! The staff is well trained and very friendly and approachable unlike many places in Singapore where everyone seems so uptight. It must be good training and working environment. This is definitely my favorite restaurant in Singapore now! I am going to tell all my friends^^

Thoroughly enjoyable all-rounded experience - great ambience, food and service. The Tomahawk steak is cooked to perfection - tender and juicy on the inside and just ever so slightly crispy on the outside. Coupled with some of the delicious sides and a great wine list, a night to remember. The bar is also a great venue for pre-dinner drinks

There is hardly a better way to treat a business guest or your best friend's birthday then the sharing experience of 1300 grams of broiled to perfection beefsteak! I've never tried any other entree on the menu--it was love at first bite. Four visits later, and nothing has changed. I wish my dates have lasted this long. Come for the tomahawk, stay for the apple crumble. This place isn't cheap, and one must budget 100/guest for a complete meal, but it IS of one the few places in SIngapore that is actually worth the price

Was on a business trip, alone. So best thing is to find a good place to stuffy ones stomach. Had a choice of some highly recommended Japanese sushi restaurants but in the past two weeks O had had my fair share of unagi, sanma, sushi and omakase fare. So found this steak house. Never regrettef my choice. Full bar offerring of scotches , greatest service the manager Fabio was confident on his recommendations. He said go for the sirloin us beef! The size was a big juicy aged steak, corn fed from usa! Juicy alright. Exactly what a steak dinner should be..enough of everything, nice freshly baked foccasia,enough for three, cream spinach and a whopping tender and juicy steak. Must have been 300 grams they never put these choices..you go there to put your teeth into meat and you leave fully satisfied.. Fashionable price for the quality. Highly recommended

Organised to meet a couple of overseas colleagues over a business dinner after the F1 weekend, i.e. Monday. Read about the restaurant from the SQ inflight magazine, so expectations were high ;-)Interesting entrance with cocktail bar on your left and maitre'd located towards the far end of the hallway. Bar is a good place to cool your heels waiting for the late comers or to enjoy the view looking towards the CBD. Dining hall is suitably laid out with interesting partitions, giving the restaurant an enclosed intimate atmosphere, parititions are actually 'wood stacks', very nicely done. Tables are spaced far enough for privacy. However, the acoustics are terrible in the restuarant, as you can hear conversations form the next table, althought they are spaced quite far apart.Shared the Wagyu Tomahawk among the three of us to be adventurous ! It tasted as good as it looks ! Cooked right at medium rare and served with a selection of sauces, very nicley done. Sides are ala carte, mushrooms and baby potatos are nice and tasty, but avoid the mashed potatos, looks and taste like baby food.Will definitely recommend for business dinner, gatherings and romantic dinners. Just keep voices low..
