I don't have much to say except that these are the best noodles I've ever had! Lots of variety in the meat (crackling, sausage, pork, cockles) and tasty, plump noodles with a beautiful charred flavour. Wish I could go back!

Fried oyster is yummm, how I wish I had had more! Meanwhile, fried kway teow is classic I always love it.

Stopped at this center early in the day to eat chicken rice and saw this place on my way out. After visiting Chinatown and indulging in the fare there I couldn't get it out of my mind. So ,long story short -I talked my wife into returning to this stall later in the evening so I could indulge in a little briny bi-valve omelet. So worth the return trip. Recommened if you are an oyster aficionado
