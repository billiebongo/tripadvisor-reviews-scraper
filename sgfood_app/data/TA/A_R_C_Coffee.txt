The taste of the coffee was outstanding. Everyone should try at least one time how excellent coffee could taste like. It also has it´s price but we liked to invest for the experience. ;)

Its a bit expensive but it worths it. Great food, good staff and cozy ambient.
Ray’s Ben brunch recommended.

A nice cosy cafe with awesome coffee.
It's located at the scenic sultan gate area.
The boss won a barista contest and this could be felt in the coffee that they serve.
Their cold brew coffee is served in cool looking light bulbs.

I heard rumours that this cafe on Sultan Road - whether there are other branches I don't know - may soon be closing. That would be a great shame. This place is best accessed via Haji Lane. To get here head north-east from Bugis station (from the Downtown or East-West lines) and turn right onto Orphir Road, left onto North Bridge Road and then Haji Lane is there (good for small independent shops) - ARC is just the other side of the mosque; you can get there via Baghdad Street or Beach Road. What I like about this cafe, other than their coffee that is, which is some of the best in Singapore, is that their menu often changes to reflect their recent interests and tastes with new innovations. At the time I was there they had the Storehouse Breakfast (see photo) which was said to have been inspired by the owners' travels in Ireland with fried eggs, smoked salmon and the Irish-infused Guinness bread, baked potato, sour cream, mesclun salad and baked beans. While not inexpensive (around $28 for this and an Americano) it is the place to go if you are in the area. One slight criticism if you plan to go there to work is that the majority of the seating is upstairs, where it is rather dark and the wifi connection is not very strong. But purely from a food and coffee point of view this place is pretty much faultless

On my discovery for the best coffee in Singapore, I was told to visit this place. The coffee was well made and was good, in fact it was very good - currently fighting for 2nd place in my list. So if you are close and like coffee, well worth visiting. Oh and the lemon meringue pie is first class

Came here for the set lunch yesterday. 3 courses for $14 is reasonable value: soup plus a Japanese chicken curry and some icecream. Nothing too exceptional with the food but hard to complain at this price point. A little noisy inside and aircon wasn't working so well
1
Arrived and place seemed nice. Food is ok and atmosphere relaxed. I didn't like the staff though. I tried to go upstairs as downstairs was crowded but got stopped by the staff and told that it is closed. They insisted on seating me. After I sat down as told and waited for another five minutes they told me that I had to order at the counter. No idea why they didn't mention that when seating me. I get back up and order, at the same time new guests come in and go upstairs without being stopped. I ask and get told that upstairs is now open. Staff obviously has no clue what they are doing or how to proper host their guests

I was there with my buddy on a Friday evening, 1 September. It was after dinner at Pizzaface, which is located at Concourse. We decided to explore the area opposite and found A.R.C Coffee. We discovered they have a decent selection of coffee, tea and cakes. We had apple crumble cake and chocolate peanut butter cake along with latte and passion fruit tea for that evening. There was live music from 8pm on their level 3 alfresco dining area and we really enjoyed that

Visited this cafe several times during my week long stay in Singapore. Coffee is very good, the cold brew being my favorite. There is seating indoors (over 2 floors) & outside. There is no table service so one must order at the counter. The service (for coffee) is a little slow so expect to wait if you arrive during a busy period. I'm used to the efficiency of most melbourne cafes & am always surprised at the time it seems to take for someone to take an order & for another to make/serve up a coffee. That being said, the quality of the beverages being turned out is great. We opted to have brunch on Sunday. My partner ordered the Ray's Ben & a chocolate milkshake (which he tells me was excellent). I ordered the healthy breakfast with an extra poached egg & a cold brew. The drinks arrived reasonably quickly (we arrived just on 1030am so they weren't very busy at the time). The food arrived about 10 mins apart - my partner had nearly finished his breakfast by the time mine came out. The kitchen obviously has an issue with timing - the mushrooms on my plate were the warmest item, followed by the sweet potato & then the brocolli & asparagus. The poached eggs unfortunately were stone cold. It was almost as if they'd been made earlier when my partner's meal came out & sat on a plate for 10 mins while they prepared the other items for my dish. I was so disappointed. Presentation was good but execution was poor. I can only imagine how bad it would have been if they were very busy. The coffee was excellent & I will definitely be back for my caffeine fix but will be steering clear of the food.

We found this to be one of our favourite coffee shops so far in Singapore (we've tried most of the "third wave' coffee shops) - those guys have a few national championship awards to their name for good reason. Do go for a single origin , we found that better than the blend. Theres a nice / relaxed ambience and there was live music advertised for some evenings. Food ... I opted for the poached egg / shredded pork breakfast option and it was okay , but wouldn't order again. My friend ordered pumpkin soup but said it was "fishy", the truffle fries were good though! I think unless we are feeling adventurous we will stick to the coffee here

Good coffee. Had beef cheek, spaghetti with shrimps, fish. All dishes were good !
Lemon meringue tart is good. Crème brûlée not crispy enough on top.
Overall Safe choice for a quick good brunch
5
Came here for some breakfast and coffee. The waffles with espresso ice cream, fruit, and cornflakes were delicious.
4
Found this hidden café through one of the review pages. I had chocholate milkshakes and it was so delicious with thick texture. Their salted caramel milkshakes was delicious too. Definitely must try!

ARC Coffee is an academy, roastery, and cafe rolled into one. Try the Piccolo Latte for a strong flavorful brew (It was so strong I couldn’t sleep at 3AM after drinking coffee at 6PM.) Check out the mural outside, showcasing how coffee is made. TIP: They have a whole day 1-for-1 Heineken half pint S$8 promo

A nicely set up cafè, slightly on the cramped side, that serves up coffee pretty much on par with specialty coffee places anywhere in the world.A bog standard menu, their espresso is nice, following the current trend to pursue all the flavours of the fruity rainbow.My partner was impressed with the coffee icecream, and the freshly squeezed lemon juice is nice, not sugared so truely is refreshing.Worth a trip just for a photo alongside the murals on the outside walls if your in the area

Have visited the place a few times for brunch with friends and I find it a "must try"! The coffee is really good quality and the variety of food is really great! We laughed so much with the tiramisu that was brought in a little bucket with a shovel for spoon! Ambience is also great in this industrial style, 2 storey place!It's self service so don't wait for somebody to come and take your order

Came here on a Sunday at 9.15am for coffee and breakfast. Resturant is bright with very friendly staff who will smile and even busy, assured you that you will be served shortly. The menu has small twist in the typical breakfast cafe menu. For example, a typical eggs Benedict will be with salmon/ ham/ bacon, hollandaise sauce, eggs and muffin/ toast bread. ARC eggs Benedict are served with pulled pork instead of ham/ salmon. And it's really tasty (ok my photo don't do much justice due to the overexposed lighting). The coffee is great, and I also ordered a passion fruit soda - thumbs up! Just the right amount of sweetness & sourness & right amount of ice. Definitely be here again for coffee and food. The only downside is that, might not be good for big groups (more than 6 person) as the place is rather Long and narrow. PS: The waffles looks great... I need to try it the next round.
5
I went to the cafe because they are included in the entertainer app 2017, and other reviews said that they have great coffee. I tried the flat white and it did not disappoint. The storehouse breakfast was okay, but the baked baby potatoes was particularly good. My friend had the beef cheeks, which was tender. The service was warm and the ambience was great to catch up with friends. I would love to return to try the yolk chicken (lots of people were having that that day)

We went there for a sunday brunchwith a big group (7ppl) and we were happy that they have a table for us despite having no booking. We could tell there efforts put into the food with quality ingredients and original recipes but i wasnt amazed by it. Decent food but a bit pricey. This could have been fine but the staff was obviously not trained and the service could have been much more efficient.Positive note, the coffee was very good
5
This ranks up there along with Nylon as just about the best cup of coffee you can get in Singapore. Really friendly staff. Great location. All in all, a very nice place to get your caffeine fix. However, keep in mind that it comes at a price. We paid 20SGD for 2 lattes and a cold brew which was slightly expensive but the quality speaks for itself
4
No complaints. Good coffee, good homemade soda. Not cheap but it's a comfortable and well maintained coffee place.
4
Was there with the family after dinner. The picollo latte was good and wife enjoyed the cappuccino tho she complained that it was not enough😉. Kids had their drinks too. Lovely decor in a cool neighbourhood.
5
I had mashed potato with chili (forgot the name of the meal) and cappucino and it was great! Nice sttafs, good coffee and food.
4
Great place to have brunch and chill over a cuppa and dessert on a lazy Sunday morning. Service staff are polite and professional. Worth a re-visit. Chanced upon the artist touching up the murals😁
4
Great coffee, food and design. Get's crowded at times but service is very efficient and (mostly young) friendly staff never seem to get stressed by the crowd. Have eaten there and food very good also. Just wish they opened at 7.00 am -- OK I know that's hard and I'd probably be the only one there ... but how about 9.00 am
4
Walked to A.R.C as it wasn't too far from our hotel, and this cafe is definitely a nice place to have brunch/hang out. We went here twice over the weekend. Coffee was good and consistent and we tried the waffles which was nice, but a bit too dry to my liking.Nice lil spot to try if you are in the area
4
Found this cafe through a review of breakfast spots. Delighted with it. They obviously take delight in their coffee which was very good. Presentation of tea was also delightful and far from the tea bag in a mug as you could get. The food was equally well presented and tasty. Well worth the visit and would visit again
5
The vanilla latte I had here was the best one I've ever had, and the service was great! The only challenge might be finding a spot the listing for the cafe on Google Maps does a good job of predicting when high traffic times are. I arrived at the cafe at 2pm and Google predicted a peak in traffic at 3pm, after which there would be a decline, which is exactly what happened. Great atmosphere and outdoor terrace as well
5
Brunch / lunch menu is extensive. We had the eggs benedict and salted egg katsu, which were both great. There were so many things I wanted to try, so I'll definitely be back.Coffee is great, but my gripe as always is that coffee cools so quickly I have to finish it in 5 minutes instead of enjoying it over conversation. No fault of theirs but I wish cafes find a way of keeping the coffees warm for longer. :
4
Saw this coffee shop in my gap time, was attracted by its painting on the wallGreeted by the 2 young staff members, ordered a cup of cappuccino and it was the best i had in SG.It was quiet when i got in, but filled with guests later onGood to spend some time there and will try the food next time
5
Nice and cozy place to sit for the coffee. There are two stories at the shop and both have the great decoration. The taste of the coffee is perfect and compliment with the great service.
5
Tucked away in Arab Street this is a cool place to have bite and coffee.
The ambience is cool and the table next to window which overlook the street is the best spot in the cafe.
Recommended to catch up with your friends or family.

Popped in here earlier today to try the coffee. Cappuccino was tasty and served with a pretty little design in the froth. Unfortunately no breakfast menu so didn't try the food.
5
Everything was great!Smiley polite staffs; the cappuccino taste amazingggg and the foods were yummy, we had Triple bliss n The Pork, and of course the Tiramisu (in the pot! So cute!).The cold brew is so so, but overall it was a great place for brunch
4
located at the end of sultan gate, A.R.C. stands out as a cafe in an area which has abundance of middle eastern eating joints.The decor was a little dull for my liking. Their piccolo Latte and regular Latte were both pretty good. The dinner options were limited and pricey. We had the ruru mian pasta, which was pretty good, and the cod fish, which was okayish. Special mention for the tiramisu.overall a great option. would be 5 star with a lower price point for food
4
Well appointed thoughtful space, friendly staff and one of the best flat whites in SG. Coffee and water were brought to the table for me. When I purchased beans and sat down prior to paying an employee came to my table to ring it up. I will go back to try the food, though did not notice many vegetarian options
4
A great post-lunch joint near the city with great coffee and waffles. Love the coffee ice cream more than the vanilla though the cornflakes are a weird touch on the waffles. Yup, go figure. The Asian aromatic juice infused soda is particularly lovely and the ample parking can't be beat! Will be back

I am a coffee connoisseur who appreciates the ambiance of a real coffee shop and baristas who really understand coffee beans and the preparation of coffee.One of the newest additions of real coffee shops in Singapore is A.R.C. Coffee shop at the intersection of Beach Road and Sultan Gate.The selection of coffee beans is very good and the preparation of various coffees is exceptional.Service is with a smile and guests are appreciated by the kind and helpful waitstaff. This is a perfect place for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon coffee break or customer conversation in an environment that is very sutibale for business and personal occasions. Try to drink just one cappuccino; I could resist ordering two on my first visit.Please support a real coffee shop in Singapore and enjoy the experience

Ordered the laksa pasta, golden chick and an ice mocha. All were very good. The golden chick had cheese oozing out and there was nacho cheese to go along with the fries. The pasta came with clams. Only feedback for the pasta is that it would be even better if it had more ingredients like prawns, squid etc.Great place to chill.Service of the staff was friendly and prompt

Chanced upon A.R.C. Coffee after dinner around Kampong Glam area. My friend & I love the coffee which is very smooth & sweet on its own without having to add much sugar. Read that John Ting manages the cafe & he won some top barista awards before which could be possibly why the coffee was great!And I thought all the cakes were pretty good too... Especially the Tropical Crumbles.Very good service, attentive in refilling our water but we were there after dinner time and it was a manageable crowd then
