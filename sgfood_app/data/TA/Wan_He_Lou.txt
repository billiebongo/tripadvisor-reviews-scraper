Went there for lunch with family for the first time. Food is delicious and waiter is very attentive. Excellent service and the standard of the food is above many restaurants that I have visited.

Food is good, service is good. We all like the lobster porridge which is so yummy.. will definitely visit again.

Location is a bit secluded but the food was great! Especially the tofu and Lala soup was tantalizing!

The lobster porridge was delicious, as were the kurabuta pork, the wasabi ebi prawns and the lotus root veg. Call ahead to pre-order the veggie drink. It’s a winner!

Overrated foods. With promo code 15% off. But the most expensive lobster porridge wasn’t entitled. T&c didn’t state. $300 bill only discounted like $15. Feeling cheated.

is a family dinner. service was good. food was served quickly. food was nice and of quality. didn’t manage to try their crab as was told we need to pre-order in advance. awesome lobster porridge but bit pricey.

Porridge tasted better than another restaurant's (also specializing in lobster porridge). Salted egg lotus root and dragon greens also delicious. Nice ambience & fair service.
5
the lobster porridge was delicious! we also ordered the pan fried kurobuta pork and sambal kang kong. the kang kong was ok but the pork was super delicious! will definitely be back to try the other dishes!
4
Overall the food is good. However it's too salty for a complete meal as most of the dishes are on the salty side. Portion is quite generalist as we ordered the 8pax meal but could not finish. Furnishing and ambience of the restaurant is considered quite cosy as there were limited tables

Its lobster porridge was famous, I was told. Pretty good and reasonably-priced.
Tofu also very well done. So was scallops.
I don't like its ribs though.
4
Food was decent. But due to messy menu and miscomm we ended up ordering 2 lobsters instead of the lobster porridge. ended up ordering an extra lobster porridge.
4
Food is pretty special for a Chinese restaurant. The pork is soft and tender. Salted egg nut is always good.
5
Thumbs up. But the price is too expensize. Two times went there. Not everyday. If the price is reasonable and little cheap, can go and enjoy eat everyday.

Ordered Lobster Porridge, nai bai & signature chicken. The lobster porridge was delicious, apart from that the rest is not worth the price. The service was not that great with the indian waitress being moody and was given a seat at a corridor beside the wall. The male waiter is well-mannered and offered to help us distribute the lobster

They had a simple variety of palatable dishes. We ordered the salted egg lotus chips that was perfectly done and had a balance of crisp, salt & sweetness. The lobster porridge had fresh seafood taste but the lobster was overcooked. Sambal petai fried rice & anchovy fried rice was great. We ordered a steamed red garoupa but the fish came out black (although they insisted it is a red garoupa), horribly overcooked though it was salted just nice. Herbal lala was abit too salty but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Yellow gravy crabmeat tofu was interesting, but the wheatgrass colored portioned of the tofu tasted weird... However the green dragon vegetable was full of praises from the table. Would come back for more if the dishes were less salty and most importantly, the seafood cooked just right. Its a pity the most expensive lobsters & fish was done wrong, otherwise, the prices the value for money with good taste.

There were 5 of us but we decided to only order 4 of the $35 set menu. If you are small eaters like us, it was more than sufficient. The food were simply delicious. The set included the lobster porridge, smoked duck, crispy prawn rolls, prawn paste chicken, and dragon vegetable. Although we ordered 4 sets, they gave us 5 deserts. Great food, great service and great value. What else can one ask for

Our group of 8 had a reservation and ordered before our arrival on a Friday evening. What a nice surprise it turned out to be! Not only were we seated at a quiet and spacious corner of the main restaurant (I think there are at least 2 side by side), it was positioned inside the air-conditioned area, making the dining experience so much better.While we all came for the lobster porridge, all the other dishes took us by surprise. Starting from the appertizers to the dessert, they were seasoned and prepared to perfection. True, not everybody would be impressed by all the dishes but I, for one, felt that this restaurant didn't have the heavy-handed MSG or sweetness that are so common in Chinese restaurants in Singapore

I've tried lobster porridge at quite a few places in Singapore and still felt Wan He Lou is one of the best. The porridge is delicious and a comfort food especially on a rainy day. A bowl with a lobster cost $50 and is good for 2 to 3 people, possibly 4.We also had the green dragon vegetables which was good as well as the salted egg lotus crisp. The lotus root crisp is good but can be too much as it's quite rich. There isn't any ambience at the restaurant and the location of the restaurant can be challenging to find parking space though there is parking along the road as well as parking in the building opposite the restaurant

Wen for dinner at 7.30pm and there were many things on the menu that was not available. We did not get to try their signature lobster porridge as they told us that their supplier did not supply them sufficient for the day. However, when we were about to finish our meal, they asked us if we wanted the lobster porridge. We tried green dragon vegetables (which was very salty), kurobuta pig (which was not bad), stir fry mee sua (edible), crabmeat tofu (which technically should have dou miao on top of the tofu but it tasted more like pandan/ green food colouring) the sauce was edible and salted egg yolk lotus chips (best dish out of everything but if you prefer crispy chips, this does not make the cut. it was a little crispy and then mostly chewy). Overall, the food was not fantastic and the portion was small, the service was really confusing and odd (it was as if everything not available on the menu was a given).
4
Food is good and value for money. Just that location is not very near MRT. Will still go there again.
4
Food was served quite fast. Dishes tasted ok. However the restaurant is very noisy and you really have to raise your voice when you talk across the table.

Reservation though confirmed through Chope was not registered at the restaurant. The entire family was turned away by the restaurant with no alternative suggestions stating they were full despite confirmed reservations.

love the taste here, they have really maintain very well. Thump up for the Chef and the staffs. Live and fresh lobster porridge is the best!!!
4
Lobster Porridge definitely a highlight here. But rest of dishes were as good, though abit on the salty side. Overall a recommended place for nice chinese food. Surprised at the complimentary dessert at the end as well!
4
aromatic steamed lobster porridge, worth it for 2 to share. however they really should have a menu. what's nice is the truffle cod fish, tender stir fried pork, and the pork ribs was very surprising.

Have always been bring the family for the usual Chinese cuisine and decide to do a change this time. My family was totally happy with the food and find it value for money ... lobster porridge stock was flavourful. Kurobuta pork, prawn rolls, green dragon vegetables, salted egg lotus root chips were all well done ..

I was introduced to this restaurant last year by my good buddy, since then I've been back for dinner several times with family, friends and colleagues. Located at Jalan Besar and close to the popular "Heng Hua" eatery Minzhong. Other than the widely-acclaimed Lobster porridge, I personally like these 4 dishes too: 1. fried lotus root coated with salty egg yolk (try pairing it with beer)2. Seafood gyoza (others usually uses pork)3. stir-fried green dragon vegetables with dried shrimps (must try)4. Stir-Fried "Mee-Sua" (wallet friendly

To call it just comfort food would do it no justice. The food is simply delicious with a tat of complexity in its combination of ingredients. There were only the 2 of us so we were limited by choices. So we chose the Lobster Porridge (awesome!), the Pan Fried Kurobuta Pork (yummalicious!) and the Crispy Lotus Root with Salted Egg (wow!). In all, an experience which didn't fail to disappoint in all aspects

(WAN HE LOU RESTURANT) Its simple exterior did not catch my attention at first but I was drawn to a montage of awards that their Chef had won, we decided to give it a try, the restaurant was crowded, we were dam lucky to have table available without making a booking. AT first we ordered the fresh Vegetable Juice with no sugar added recommended by the staff. The mix of pineapple and sour plum masked any veggie taste and it actually tasted very good for a healthy fruit juice. We then ordered their Signature Lobster Porridge, The porridge served was piping hot and the broth with spring onion looked scrumptious. The broth did not disappoint as it was sweet and flavorful with the 'teo chew style' the lobster was also very fresh and meaty. Next we were served the Pan Fried Kurobuta Pork and Crispy Lotus with Salted Egg .The pork was nicely done, tender and juicy. It made a good dish to pair with the porridge. The Lotus Root was very interesting. It was thinly sliced, deep fried and then fried with curry leaves, chili padi and salted egg. Anyone who loves salted egg has got to try this dish. Followed by the Eight Treasure Fried Rice, which was fried rice with yam, sweet corn and a bunch of other stuff. We also tried the Green Dragon vegetable that was recommended by their staff. This is also one of their signature vegetable dish as well. Vegetables were stir fried and sprinkled with deep fried anchovies. Looked plain on arrival. Definitely not your regular green leafy veg but had this unique crunchy bite to it and surprisingly tasty. Not a bad recommendation. Unfortunately we had no room for desert. Anyway beside the yummy food, a big thanks to the staff they were friendly and very efficient I will definitely return to try their other food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon

Manager and staff are very friendly and helpful. Recommended signature dishes which are very tasty, fried lotus with curry leaves, lobster porridge, qing long vegetables. Coconut dessert awesome!! Worth all the calories.

Love this restaurant! The porridge lobster was really good!
Beware of the location though, some bars with "Women" are just meters away.

We were the only ones in the whole restaurant on a weekday night. We were skeptical about the food at first, but were absolute wow-ed by the entire course of dinner. The plate presentation was delicate, food was awesome. There was only 1 waitress serving, cleaning, replacing chinaware. We were impressed by her promptness to serve.

The chef that operating in this place is the same chef for The Orange robster. It's seem only him made robster porridge recognized. The porridge taste a bit plain and small robster was fresh and chewy. My hubby dish smoke duck was average same quality of smoke duck in CS.

A small cosy air-conditioned eatery hidden amongst the shophouses in the old but central Jalan Besar neighbourhood, it serves unique and delicious local zi char (Chinese cooked and served on-demand dishes). Their signature lobster porridge is flavourful and my favourite in town. Do reserve ahead for dinner though as there are limited tables and they are often full

My partner in crime invited me to this restaurant, knowing my love for congee/chinese porridge.We tried the speciality of the chef, roasted duck, ok but not exceptional and the mustard greens, delucious.The lobster porridge really deserves a special mention and it is certainly worth one more visits with friends to explore more extensively their menu
