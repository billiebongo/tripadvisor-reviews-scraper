I heard from friends that the nonya food ar good. However after this visit, I would advise other friends that this place is not worth a visit at all. No service and slow serving time.
3
Crowded with residents nearby with nowhere to go. Food is good but slightly with a higher price tag. Portion is small but the food is authentic. Service is prompt which deserves commendation.
5
As a Singaporean who has come here many times, I feel that the food here is extremely nice, especially the curry fish head and fried chicken. The staff are polite and nice. The place is clean too. Would recommend everyone to try this place.
5
Love how the food is authentic nonya. They also come with small servings and lower prices which means that you can try more dishes.
Quality of food has been consistent over the years. Yum!!
4
The beef rendang was delicious, the itak sioh is sedap! The honey pork was sweet and tasty, and the ayam buah keluak was shiok... don't forget about the desserts, they were sweet and tasty!
5
Had some yum food here. Definitely recommend this place. We had the fish head curry and the tamarind pork ribs with white rice.
3
Air-conditioning, a large menu selection and very reasonable pricing make this a neighbourhood favourite. The food is tasty but not exceptional.

Ivins serves Peranakan food, a mix of Chinese and Malay food. The food is both delicious and reasonable. The price is set for either a single portion or for more people, according to the number of people in your party. You can also order the set lunch which is between $6-$7. I find the set lunch very reasonable. The choice is either beef or chicken cooked with different sauces. Please check the menus in my photos. The array of food is mind boggling. I found it very difficult to order. It is best to ask for advice if you haven't eaten Peranakan food before . It can also be very spicy. It is a very casual place and sometimes the service can be slow. The staff is very friendly though. There are 2 tables of dessert which one can buy for takeaway

THE GOOD: been there for more than 20 years!!! cosy place which would make a homesick person "come alive" with everything on the menu so flavourful!!! Best of all? one of the rare places in this country where it is all affordably priced =)THE BAD: limited parking space. peak hour mite be a nightmare to wait... for the main dishes... the standard has dropped tremendously. maybe the first generation of chefs has left? i don't know but def it has lost its original taste... the one i tasted in 1999.TIPS: go before the school dismissal time of 12pm, do before the dinner crowd which starts@ 5p

Ivins is easy to find, just off the main road, but hard to find a place to park. We made a booking through Chope and didn't have to queue for our table.There isn't much Peranakan character for most of the dishes in the use of spice but they tasted home cooked. Price was beat, each portion for 2 small eaters, and costs mostly about $6 each. We had babi pongteh, sambal manis snapper, kangkong, hepio soup and tofu packets, 3 bowls of dessert for $40. Plain water is diy and free.If you can tolerate slow service, Ivins offers decent food at decent price. Make reservations beforehand because there is always a queue

Review by Dr Sim. Very good Peranakan food. I should know. Food is reasonably priced. Service is slow. Parking is challenging. Very crowded hence slow service. Waitresses are polite. Value for money.
4
Tasty peranakan dishes. Old favourites still good. Nice ambience.
Fair service. Great price.
Go early to ensure adequate parking and seats as it tends to be crowded especially on weekends.
4
All time classic dishes that's similar to what we eat at home. Peranakan cuisine, simple
yet tasty.
Our fave - honey glazed pork, otah otah, prawn or fish with assam or sambal, ayam rempah and the local desserts.
4
Reasonably priced home cooked Nyonya food although portions are on the smaller side. However, that allows sampling many dishes from their many menu items.Thankfully we reserved as there's a standing waiting lineShorthanded due to crowd of diners. Hence service is slow and utensils ran out when we were there (washings could not keep up
4
I went there with 2 local friends on a Sunday for early lunch. We shared the fish head curry and the sweet potato leaves. So delicious! There were a lot of local diners and that's always a good sign. Service was efficient. It was a rewarding meal after our hike at the nearby nature reserve
4
Simple place, simple food, but good taste. Mainly a baba eatery. Noisy due to the structure of the restaurant. When the place is full, the noise can be quite a dampen. Price wise, very affordable, although each serving can be rather small. Ambience, - you can forget it, just eat and go. Parking, can be an issue also
3
We had the chicken buah kluak dish, the hee peow soup, the lady finger's dish, fish head cury - to go with steamed white rice.Once renowned for its Peranakan passion for perfection, though acceptable, we can't help wondering if the dishes we were served with, could have been done better.Perhaps our high expectations led us astray. Nevertheless, still a good outing, Considering we managed to grab one of the rare available parking lots. Phew
3
Large menu selection with most Peranakan mainstays. Portions are small but dishes are very reasonably priced. (most around SGD 5) Cooking is decent. Flavors generally authentic and convincing but a lot of meats are overcooked and not consistent across multiple visits. Decor is simple and homely. Service is passable. Overall, worth a visit for good Peranakan food without frills in Singapore

We popped into Irvins on a Friday evening for quick meal. The fairly big restaurant is situated in the Binjai Park shops on Dunearn Road. The restaurant was fairly quiet for a Friday night. We were shown to our table quickly ordered our drinks. We then browsed through the large menu which also acted as place mats. When my companions started to order dish after dish, I was wondering how the four of us could finish the eight or nine dishes we ordered. They assured me the portions were quite small and we could definitely finish the lot!The dishes were served fairly quickly. They included pork ball soup, sayur lodeh, fried fish with Sambal, ladies fingers with sambal, otah, praised pork ribs, and two others whose name I could not remember, accompanied with boiled rice. The extremely small fried fish were over fried and the ladies fingers were a disappointment, but the sayer lodeh were very good. All the servings were very small. I had a banana panget to finish off the meal. Price wise, it was very reasonable, especially for SingaporeI will certainly visit again.
5
Even this was my first try on Peranakan local food in Singapore I was lucky to choose the right restaurant thanks to my friend.I cannot remember all the names of each dishes, but I do remember the best dish tried then which was 'Honey pork'. I could eat it again and again with beer. It was that good.The price was around $5-6 for each menu I remember, quite cheap and reasonable.I would like to visit again if I go to Singapore next time. Truly recommended
4
The food is really good and affordable but the portions are a little bit small. Feel free to order more. No service charge or GST
2
The prices on the menu is not expensive until you see the portion of food served. The waitresses acted like they are doing you a favor when you patronise the restaurant instead of appreciating your business. Don't even try the dessert.
4
Still a crowd pleaser with its midrange prices. But the MSG is a bit of a letdown. Very full keluak nuts in a rich gravy. The stuffed mackerel could do with more stuffing so ask for a side of sambal belachan. Forget the omelette.
3
Just wanted a simple meal and I was in the area. The last time I ate here was prob a decade ago. This is a long time establishment so it must be alright to have survived so long. Ordered the hee peow soup and was disappointed that the fish balls and prawn balls were not handmade but store bought type. The meatball was ok. Handmade and juicy. Really don't think it costs too much time or money to make the fish balls or prawn balls fresh. The soup was garlicky and salty. Portion size for $6.50 is ok laaa. Nasi kuning coconut yellow rice $1 was ok. Fragrant but lukewarm. Abit dry too. The otak $2 per piece was quite nice with real fish meat in it. The flavor was ok but strangely it was served icy cold. Wonder if it was cooked thru. I was in a rush so I didn't bother to ask for a change. It came with 1 piece of cucumber and a small scoop of sambal chilli. The chilli was sweet. Not too bad. Total damage for this ok meal was roughly $10. They charge GST but no service charge. Quite ok. They have a large range of food items so I'll prob be back again to taste other dishes in future. Hope I won't be disappointed again! Gave an average rating cos in general it's ok laaa.
5
Excellent place for both small and big groups. Dishes are served in small claypots and you can have so many variety of different dishes to choose from. Kids friendly - non Spicy dishes are available too. Must complete meal with their small serving of desserts (hot or chilled available)Highly Recommended Dishes:--------------------------------1) Itek Sioh (sweet-savoury - Duck, best and cheapest)2) Beef Rendang (dry spicy Beef)3) Ayam Buah Keluak (savoury chicken "curry" but with quite an exotic taste - very difficult dish to master to get the acquired taste)4) Papaya SoupEnjoy
3
I think that is typical for most Peranakan dishes that they are saucy like stew. Many dishes have peanuts therefore if you have peanuts allergy, don't eat here, otherwise the dishes are quite tasty and not spicy hot even if some dishes may look like there are lots of chilis. The portion is quite small unless the menu stated it is for more than 1 person. I would suggest order 1.5 to 2 dishes per person for normal appetite (or course you will be sharing). Try the curry fish head and rendan beef, they are popular Peranakan dishes

We are regular patrons of Ivin’s at Binjai Park, Bukit Timah, and in recent weeks seen portions of their dishes getting smaller and smaller without a change in price. This has led us having to order two portions each dish for take-aways to feed 5 people at home. Today when my wife and I went to have lunch there and to take-away food dishes for dinner as is our practice, we were told there’s a new menu. An “upsized” version of the same dish is now available, which would cost less than two portions of the same dish. For instance, the popular Ayam Rendang cost $6.20 per dish suitable for 2 people. An upsized portion costs $11.50 and is suitable for 3 to 4 people.This is not the only change. There are now 6 waitresses plus the cashier compared with 3 before, and hopefully this translates to better and faster service, and reduced waiting time. The lady who does the deserts and drinks can devote her entire attention to this task. I made a remark to one of the waitresses who has worked for several years saying that now with six of them, she can smile! She did, ear to ear and said, “ Uncle, you are right!”. There’s no change in the ambiance, and decor. The food quality is the same. The new menu has guidelines for the amount you need to order: Under “How much to Order,” each serving dish, unless it’s for an individual, is sufficient for 2 persons. For 2 people they suggest 4 to 5 dishes. For 3 to 4 people, 6 to 8 dishes; and for 8 people 8 dishes two of each dish. There are also some changes to the menu items, eg. one now has for a Lunch Set which serves 1 person, a choice of Nasi Lemak with either Ayam Goreng or Ayam Rendang or Beef Rendang. Previously they gave you only Ayam Rendang.As before, their menu prices are inclusive of the prevailing Government taxes, but there’s no service charge. I reviewed this Restaurant on January 25th this year, so for more information on their food, please refer to this review.Details:Ivin’s Peranakan Restaurant19/21 Binjai Park, Dunearn RoadSingapore 589827Tel: 6468 3060.

Every time I go to Ivins I'm amazed at the delicious flavours. The rendang and curries have the freshest herbs and spices. So good. Lots on the menu is gluten free and the wait staff are able to confirm the ingredients if you want to double check. Highly recommend for a taste of Singapore

Peranakan food exists in the former Stratis Settlements of Singapore, Malacca and Penang: each has its own cuisine. In Singapore, this is my favourite outlet, off Bukit Timah Road, the food is excellent (especially the Fish Balls Lemak, the Inche Kabin, the Nyonya Sayer Lodeh/Chap Chye and their Beef Rendang with yellow rice). But the best of all is the pricing: it is a joy to get Western guests to offer to buy dinner here - and see their eyes light up when the bill comes. Two small niggles, the acoustics of all hard surfaces makes it a noisy place to eat - and the parking can be a nightmare - but that is NOT the restaurant's fault! I keep coming back for a real treat that does not break the bank. Famous chefs - eat your hearts out! I have eaten at some of Singapore "finest" but this food is better by far

Ivins is located at Brinjal Park in the Bukit Timah area. It is a popular local haunt for economical and good Peranakan food. It is open for lunch and dinner but they are closed on Thursday. The food are served on Claypot containers complete with a basket as the dishes are served piping hot. Some of the favorites that we like are Buah Kalak chicken, hoo peow soup, tauhu pong soup, otah, Ngoh Hiang, Babi ponteh, fish cake lemak, Assam fish head. Sayur Lodeh along with ladies fingers with sambal is good. Good to go in a group then many dishes can be ordered. We normally asked for extra Buah Kalaks. Each additional cost 50 cents. As for rice, you have the choice for white rice or yellow rice. The restaurant has meals for children too and for those who just want individual dishes, nasi lemak, lontong, gado gado are available. As for desserts, they are very "cheap". A small portion bowl costs about $1.20. The bo bo char char is really good. Other desserts include tau suan, Gula Melaka sago. Each Claypot dish cost about S$5.50. Pretty reasonable and economical. Only downside is car parking. As it is in a residential estate in Bukit Timah, this can be challenging. But this is overcome by the great food this place serves.

Can't get enough of the food here. Will come again & again.
Went there today but was disappointed as they are closed on Thursdays.
5
If you are looking for home cook Peranakan food ??? This is the place to go !!Reasonable priced and No service charge.You can order many different dishes to try given the reasonable pricing. We always end up ordering a lot feels like having "Tok Panjang".Love the sambal Timun , Ayam Bua Keluk and Udang Masak Nanas. Desserts are reasonably priced too. We go there 2-3 times a week when craving for some spicy Peranakan food. Never got tired of it. So "sedap" meaning delicious, tasty or yummy in malay. Give it a sho
5
We ordered the fish head curry, sambal kang kong and buah keluak chicken. Every single one of the dishes was fantastic and I would definitely go back again! Ambience is like a noisy old school coffee shop resembling some other shophouse restaurants in Malaysia. It was very crowded on the day I visited but the staff ensured that we didn't have to wait too long for the food
5
Fantastic food and extremely quick service. This place is a place of my childhood which has never changed much, and pretty much visit here each time I return to Singapore. Very simplistic decor and environment, the only downside is that it may be difficult to get a parking spot nearby

Ivins Peranakan Restaurant, so says its Menu (see photo attached).The cuisine it manages is indeed Peranakan. The food is good. Not so the service.The ultimate no-no is to serve good food cold. Whilst the food we got was not cold, it was very nearly so. And we had to ask repeatedly for more chilli sambal. And we had to ask repeatedly for our chendol dessert, part of our set lunches, to be served.4 of us. We had one noodle dish and 3 set lunches.The set lunch consists of nasi kuning, fishcake lemak, ikan bilis, chicken rendang, egg omelette and dessert of our choice. We opted for 3 chendol desserts. Now, the set lunch is also" available for takeaway throughout the day".One concludes that the various dishes that make up the set lunch are readily available and, if necessary, be heated up before being served. We are not talking of 1 serving of the set lunch.... but 3.The yellow rice came very slightly above room temperature. The fishcake lemak was one miserable fishball topped with a spoonful of lemak sauce - all cold. The ikan bilis, cucumber, chillii sambal - understandably, was at room temperature. More so, then, the need for the chicken rendang to be hot. It came luke warm - small and boney. Photo Note = see the size of the chicken vis-a-vis the cucumber slice.The chendol, when it eventually came, was good. Except that the ice, instead of fine shaved was chunky ice chips. Where can

Good food at reasonable price. Portion is small thus great for small family to share a variety of dishes. We had our usual Honey Pork, Sambal Kang Kong, Itik Tim and Bubur Cha-Cha. The Itik Tim was not as great as previous visit, seemed diluted.Service was initially ok but was slow when the place was packed. Being Sunday evening, the place was full with people waiting for tables. Service staff seemed overwhelmed

I used to frequent this Peranakan eatery when it was located in Upper Thomson as that's my hood and my mum likes their food. After it moved to Binjai Park, I have not been there for many years but revisited again today when a friend has craving for Peranankan food. The home-style food standard remains good (not remarkable) and service was fast. We ordered 8 dishes with 5 desserts for the 5 of us and the bill came up to$65. Super great value for money.
3
Can find the Ivins (Hougang Heartland Mall) outlet on Trip Advisor but believe they are part of the same group. We used to eat at the upper Thomson place year ago before they closed. Our kids found about this Ivins at Heartland Mall Hougang and said we should try it out. Its quite convenient location - just next to Kovan MRT station (NEL line). The place is comfortable and quite crowded as it as Sat evening. Many families with their senior folks eating there. Order the ngoh hiang, kangkong sambal, hee pioh meat ball soup, babi pongteh and a assam curry fish head. Same standard as the last time we tried around 4 years ago. We waited a long time for our curry fish head. I think they forgot the order...but anyway it came and it was OK. Nothing to shout out about. Its more like a fast food joint where you get seated, order and the the dishes comes bang bang bang, eat eat eat then settle in cash (yes, they don't take credit card!) and then you go to do your groceries /shopping (its neighborhood mall after all). Can go there once in while lah.I realised that they charge for plain water. Now more and more place in SG are charging for plain drinking water which is actually tap water

Ivin’s Peranakan Restaurant has been around since the later part 1970s and their menu has not changed much. Their Nyonya food is flavorful, spicy and authentic, relying on traditional family recipes for that distinct taste. The dishes we nearly always order listed randomly are: the Ayam Buah Keluak; Babi Pongteh; Ayam Rendang; Beef Rendang; Nyonya Chap Chye; Fish Cake Lemak; Fried Ngo Hiang; Bakwan Kepeting; Hee Pow Soup; Chye Poh Omelette; and Sambal Kangkong. For deserts, our favorites are the Chendol and the Buboh Cha Cha. The dishes are served nearly always piping hot. Smallish portions allow guests to try out several dishes at the same sitting. Eat with steamed white or yellow rice. For lunch when there’s only two of us, we order single dishes like the Nyonya Set lunch or the Mee Siam or Nyonya Mee. I find the Set Lunch good value for money as you get the Nasi Kuning with chicken rendang, fishcake lemak, egg omelette; ikan bilis, a thick slice of cucumber with delicious chili sauce, and a desert of your choice from the desert menu.Ivins is popular for lunch and dinner, with both, the generation of seniors as well as the younger set. It’s much like Peranakan “fast food” where the food comes out fast, simply presented, portions matching their prices in an air-conditioned environment. Only at their Binjai outlet is beer and stout available. Otherwise for us, it’s fresh lime juice, chin chow or bandong, amongst a short list of soft drinks. Those sensitive to MSG may experience some mouth dryness later, but it’s still value for your money. A great place to bring that overseas guest or visitor for a taste of Peranakan food.The service can be very slow especially when there are only a few waitresses and the restaurant is crowded as it tends to be at peak meal times. We avoid this by going either before the peak times or just after.Free parking along the road side and the side roads of the Estate is available. Separate male and female toilets are inside the restaurant. It’s wheel-chair friendly. No WiFi. No service charge as well.Details:Ivin’s Peranakan Restaurant19 Binjai ParkSingapore 589827Tel: 6468 3060. Closed on Thursdays.Daily: 11:30 am - 3:00 pm, 5:00 pm - 9:00 p

Restaurant was full, when we arrived early Sunday night with a group of mates for a dinner catchup. Which is always a positive sign in my view, food must be good. Lucky Pradeep had made a reservation.The problem we had here was that the there were two waitresses that I could see for a restaurant full of approx. 60people, so a glass of water took 15minutes, we had to go the counter and collect our drinks as the waitress had no time, the staff were sweating they were run off their feet. the first food dishes took 45minutes to arrive while Ok, by the time it arrived we had lost our lustre and wanted to leave.Really disappointing. Ivin needs to hire some staff
5
Had lunch with my friends, it was a pleasant surprise that tuck away in the corner of bukit timah have such a nice eating place. Highly recommended
4
Competent Nyonya cuisine but I wish they'd go easy on the MSG on some of the dishes. Must tries include the ayam buah keluak, babi assam, udang nanas and chap chye
5
Great flavours, interesting and unique peranakan food. Fish fried in banana leaves is great here. So are several other dishes. The portions are not very large but very cheaply priced. So you can have a feast and try almost anything you want to try. Great find, we are still greatful to the friend who took us there
4
Very well priced, our meal that included a large Asam Fish Head (they give you more that the head of course) with 6 other dishes came under S$100 for 5 of us. Generous servings and very tasty food though you will end up feeling thirsty after the meal from the spices and the MSG
5
If you look past its humble set up and non-service, you will definitely give it a 5 star rating. 5 stars for its good flavoured food. 5 stars for its pricing. Definitely not a romantic or ideal place for those looking for a good dining ambience.I will most likely bring a visitor out of Singapore to this place passing it off as one of Singapore's best Peranakan eateries
3
We were in the area and tried out this restaurant. All dishes served were extremely nice although the servings were small. Fish and chips was basic (don't come here to order the western choices.) Prices look attractive but that is also comparable with the serving size. The restaurant competes with a local pizza restaurant and coffee shop. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if you are in the area and want something different then give this place a try. If you like the review then please acknowledge
4
For food lovers who love a bit of everything. Amazing assortment of meat/ soup/ vegetable dishes. All served in small serving and low prices so you can try almost everything. Great chendol to go along. Casual dining with Aircon so it's perfect for an affordable meal
4
Great place (with aircon) for families to enkoy local Peranakan food.Peranakan is an authentic culture from Singapore-Malaya region mixing Chinese, Malay and Westen influences (not to confuse with fushion as this is not!)Great honey pork, beef rendang, nasi Kuning, satay, curry.Fresh lime juice is highly recommended to drink to cool down the spices....;-
4
Very good Peranakan food at this restaurant, located in an upscale, residential part of Singapore. The decor and ambience take second place to the food, which arrives without too much effort at "plating". Somehow the place manages to keep prices affordable, and quite a number of regulars come and patronize this no-frills eatery. The desserts are really good value as they come in small portions -- with prices to match. Service is friendly. Guests are made to feel at home, and the food tastes really good, just like home-cooked dishes
4
This was a random lunch with In-Laws and Wife. The food was great but the deserts were not to our expectations, especially those with ice shavings like chendol. Even the Tau Suan and Pulut Hitam was not very good, and kinda small portions too. The Must try is the Beef rendang, interesting that it was gravy based as opposed to the usual dry type, went very well with both white and yellow rice. Tau Goreng had Sambal Belachan over it, another difference. Costs about $90 for 6 pax, thought was quite reasonable. Free parking at the roadside, if you reach there before 12 noon
4
My wife's first experience with Pernakan cuisine. Service was good and I just love the otaks. A great blend of flavors at very reasonable price.
4
Great Peranakan restaurant, full only with locals and expats that love the Peranakan cuisine. There were 6 of us so we sampled several dishes, all delicious and full of flavour, The price is quite low, as you would expect from an establishment such as this one, service is not that great but the place was literally stormed and waiting is quite normal apparently. Certainly recommended if you are into new experiences or you love local Peranakan food
2
Ive been a fan of ivins since I was young because there isn't any other "bang for buck" Peranakan food out there other than ivins.However my recent visit was marred by an unfortunate incident where I bit into a stone in my "chai po", or aka preserved omelette/radish dish. It clearly wasn't washed properly prior and I almost cracked my tooth after that.After feedback a new dish was provided but that was it.
5
My favorite peranakan restaurant. Restaurant is furnish normally, nothing great, a little old and casual. Food is really good and cheap. My favorite dishes: bakwan kepeting (meat ball soup), beef rendang, ngo hiang, fu Yong egg, deep friend fish etc. favorite desert: sago Melaka and mo mo cha cha
3
This place serves nonya peranakan food. I first tried the food at Binjai Park a few years ago and recently at Kovan. It is so different. When I ate at Binjai Park, the food tastes so good. I was disappointed when I tried the same dishes at the branch at Kovan
4
A fantastic family restaurant. Food is authentic and comes in small serves (at very reasonable prices) so you can order more different dishes to try. Much better than those restaurants that serve in gigantic portions and all you can do is order two or three dishes between two people.Simple family restaurant. I'd go there again and again
5
Probably one of the few places left unchanged from my childhood. Great value for money, and I'm not saying it is simply cheap, but does give one a sense of authenticity with the way they serve each dish, their simple decor, tables and chairs. Extremely friendly staff, extremely quick service. Hope this place never changes
2
I have given this restaurant numerous times to redeem themselves but they have time and time again failed. Why do I go there in the first place? For the price, the food is authentic and flavourful for peranakan fare. It is hard to find a comparable family restaurant of this nature in Singapore. Now the food is getting to be inconsistent. Some of their gravies were watered down. I had the chap chye that only had cabbage and nothing else.But what frustrates patrons more is the service, or lack of. Do not go there over the weekend. They are definitely understaffed and sometimes look like they are like chickens running without their heads. Orders get lost, orders can take up to 45 minutes. I have seen people walk out, I have seen staff getting yelled at. There doesnt seem to be a manager there or somebody who can take charge of the room. I wrote in a couple of times to their head office with no reply. There are a few staff members who have been with the company for years and they seem helpless to the barrage of complaints. The restaurant is also very noisy. The floor is tiled and front wall is glass, making it sometimes unbearably noisy during a busy period. It is such a waste to see this happening but I suppose that is the company decision and feel we should not support it
2
I have been going to the Ivins on and off at Kovan for 3+ years now and I must say standards keep falling. I went recently and I was very disappointed with the watered down Ayam Buah Keluak and the lack of Buah Keluak in the dish. Don't bother ordering the omelette as we were served a saucer sized omelette - $5 ... what is the cost of 1 egg, oil, gas for frying, labour.... come on be generous, at least use 2 eggs!!. Service is generally poor during peak hours. I don't think I will be visiting again as there plenty more of such cafes along Katong serving good Ayam Bua Keluak with the Buah!
3
Was disappointed with the entire dining experience. First of all , we had to queue up to be seated as they didn't take reservations. Finally when we got a seat no one came to take our order and we had to get the service staff attention by finding them , the food quality was also not so fantastic, the only thing that was good was the dessert. All in all the entire experience was not so pleasant. Wont recommend it as there are other choices around that area
4
location - a short walk from public transport / a pain to parkpremise - big enough and good for huge families as they have modular table settingsstaff - too busy to be polite but they are effectivecost - cheap as chips BUT the portion has shrunk madly! a portion is only a few mouthfuls EXCEPT for the soup dishesenvironment - be prepared to shout and compete for volume as the crowd gets crazy packed!good for big family gatherings and just ORDER away... no burn marks will be left in your pockets :

Being a Peranankan myself, I have refrained from dining at Peranankan restaurants as the food is never always as good as the those whipped up by my Grandma and Mum.I was skeptical when my partner suggested we had dinner here but... I was amazed at the quality of the food.What we ordered:1. Ayam Tempra - Not bad but the portion is a tad small. Chicken is succulent and tasty.2. Bakwan Kepiting - Meatballs are soft and soup is tasty. Not enough for 6 adults unless you cut the meatballs in half and share.3. Sayur Lodeh - My favourite dish of all. Standard was up to par.4. Babi Pongteh - Portion is the smallest of all with about 5 big pieces of meat and we had to share. However, the gravy is delicious enough to make up for the lack in portion.5. Udang Assam Goreng - I didn't try this dish as I do not eat seafood but my dinner companions said it was good so I'll take their word for it.6. Honey Pork - Very minute pieces of fried pork in very dark sauce that looks black. Doesn't look appealing but it fared 'ok' in taste.7. Fuyong Egg - The usual egg, scrambled and fried with bean sprouts and peas. Nothing can go wrong here.8. Sayur Lemak - Vegetables were not soft enough, coconut gravy was too diluted and the sweet potatoes gave the appearance of being too hard on first prod with a fork but was soft enough to chew.9. Hee Piow Soup - Soup was delicious and fish balls were soft. Will order this again.10. Nasi Kuning x 6 - Very fragrant rice!11. Dessert: Chendol, Gula Melaka Sago - Skip the dessert if you can as there is nothing to shout about. Very small portion. Chendol was too sweet while the Gula Melaka Sago has too much ice. Wanted to order Bubur Trigur but it was sold out. Since it was sold out, it probably means that it's good!Nothing to complain except that the portion is small and is a good trait of theirs if you'd like to order more dishes to taste and share. Price-wise, it cost an average of S$4++ per dish.In total, we paid S$63 for 6 adults and 1 child and is considered quite affordable!Will dine here again but probably at the Heartland Mall branch. If you are dining at the Bukit Timah branch, suggest to make a reservation beforehand as it gets pretty packed, especially on weekends and on public holidays.p.s. I was too hungry and only realized that I didn't take any pictures until the meal was over

The fried beansprouts with salted fish was very pathetic. The beansprouts were overcooked and covered with lots of oil. We informed the staff including the supervisor and what we got were rude defensive remarks instead of the feedback being taken objectively. The waitress gave us a replacement for the fried beansprouts which was just as bad. In the end, we did not want to eat the dish and they still insisted on charging us for it. Their service and quality of food have deteriorated compared to a few years ago

Went to Ivins last Sunday, the 26th of Jan 2014. We had a group of 9 people so we ordered quite a number of dishes and had to double it because the portions were really really small. We ordered the food around 6.30pm, waited till 7.15pm then the shrimp and crab meat omelet arrived, no rice and no other dishes till around 7.30pm. The place grew from moderately crowded to becoming a full blown dinner crowd and there were only the handful of staff attending to all the tables. One of them was even heavily pregnant! We decided to just spend the time chatting and catching up and if we needed iced water, we'd take turns helping ourselves.The long wait aside, the food was so-so. Better than some, but definitely not the best. Being a Peranakan myself, the food was no where close to what grandma used to dish out but by restaurant standards, was pretty alright. The blachan, the staple of every paranakan meal, was a letdown. It just tasted like something that came out of a can!The ayam buah keluak was pretty alright, two or three rather small nuts and a small portion of chicken that didn't taste as if it was simmering in the pot all day long. Something was a tad off there but the gravy was alright. Here are my thoughts on some of the other dishes we had-Itek Sioh - this was my favorite of the night. The gravy was deliciously sweet and went well with steaming hot rice and a generous dollop of balachan. Nonya chap chye was rather flat, stock had little or no fragrance and absolutely no hint of tou cheo. Otah bakar - very small portion so be prepared to order a couple of helpings. The texture was alright, sufficiently fragrant and coconutty while having a slight hint of being charred over a fire. The chilli was not to my liking.Overall, it is one of the better places to satisfy your cravings for Peranakan food but the location and the long wait are definite put-offs. Would I go back? Perhaps......

An old friend and his family hosted us to Sunday lunch in this restaurant. It is indeed a joy to find such a wonderful restaurant in Singapore serving delicious Peranakan cuisines. We had spicy chicken, beef, fish and vegetable dishes and I must say they are as good as the ones I normally have in my home country. We were also happy with the speed of being served despite being a busy Sunday afternoon. My only contention with this place is the difficulty in getting a parking lot for our vehicle

2 Dishes, one prawn curry and the other a chicken curry - both inedibleThe smell of the prawn curry made me fell sick and the wife just said lets leave the dishes and go elsewherePossibly the worst food we've come across in Singapore and a real shame as we live within walking distanc

Went to this restaurant with a local friend who told me it was good. It was indeed very good with kudos to the duck in sauce. The sauce was delicious really home made. Rest of dishes were good and though I did not pay prices seemed very reasonable for Singapore standards. Hope to come back

Not necessarily an accessible location if you do not drive, this no-frills tucked away restaurant just off Dunearn Road serves great peranakan food. Extensive menu, reasonable prices, and good service make this a good place for casual dining for anyone craving peranakan food. Worth the trip. No service charges added to the bill, so tip at your discretion

Ivin's has been around since the 70s (I think), the outlet at Bukit Timah serves up home style peranakan. Reasonably priced, tasty with variety of dishes to choose from. A great family or friends hang out for a hearty peranakan. The good thing is each main dish priced from $5-$15 in moderate portion. So a group of 3-4 persons can order between 5-6 dishes to share. That way you can sample all the different mains from seafood, meat, veggie to desserts (each at $1.50 only). Our favourite - honey pork, assam fried snapper fillet, fish otah, ayam rempah (fried chicken), assam prawns and kangkong or lady's fingers with sambal. Dessert bubur chacha or pulut hitam.

So I was in Singapore, and we visited this Peranakan restaurant whose only shining star is its low price point for its food. The other star was for the quality of the food. Everything we ordered was delicious - from the nonya chap choy, beef rendang, udang assam etc. What really completely MARRED the experience was that the food took 40 mins to arrive - the first dish, that is. Everything else came very slowly. It was terrible. The place was full on a Saturday night, but I noticed only 3-4 staff running around. Was there only one chef? Many tables had no food at all, and customers were complaining and annoyed (not just us). When the food came, the portions were small! OMG. They were not meant to be shared by a party larger than 2. (i.e. if you have a party of 3 or more, the food sizes would not suffice). My suggestion - have a small, medium, large option for patrons, increase the prices of the food to ensure larger portions and more staff. There really is no excuse. Please only go here if there are no other Peranakan restaurants to try.Hair-pulling!!!

Excellent value for money for some true blue Peranakan food. Especially enjoyed the salted veg with duck soup, beef rendang, honey pork. Dessert is a must try too at SGD1.20 a portion. Bear with the wait especially during weekend and you'll leave satisfied. Highly recommended.

This place used to be much better. But my last trip there could be my last ever. Deco is dated, lacks service And food is as best average and not worth it's price. Sad.

good peranakan food and cheap

We come here for dinner once a week. It is the perfect place as it has a kid's menu as well as great food for us. The restaurant is simple but it has the best food in town. It can be very busy at the weekends which makes the wait for a table and service slow. My advice would be to call and reserve a table. Prices are reasonable for bukit timah area. Short walk to the main road where it's easy to get a bus or taxi. Enjoy. Order the Chicken curry which is a favourite of mine.

I shall be very pleased if you will convey this to Kovan Ivins. I can't find their website.http://annkschin.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/ivins-peranakan-restaurant-and-singapore.htmlLast July, I visited Singapore for 2 weeks from New Zealand. I went to this restaurant at Kovan 5 times. I was impressed by their service. The last time I was there, I left my pink reading glasses. The next day, I realised I lost it some where, it was day before I left for NZ, and I was upset because it was prescription glasses. I went to the restaurant the next day. The waitress recognised me, and gave me my glasses. Whew!!!!! She had put it safely waiting for me to come back.This blog post is a belated Thank you to Ivins in Kovan. I am not particular about the food, the service won me over

Ivins used to be THE place to go to for authentic and reasonably priced Peranakan food. But not any more.The portions are measley, and the food quality below average. I could only see one tiny piece of crabmeat & loads of onions in my Shrimp & Crabmeat Omelette. I thought they had made a mistake and asked the server but no, she said it was the right dish. Even the desserts are served in ridiculously tiny bowls. The service is terrible. Even at lunchtime, where there are more servers than diners, getting a server's attention is very challenging. They talk to each other in a corner of the restaurant and show zero interest in serving you. And like one earlier reviewer commented, reservations do not mean anything at this restaurant. Come on Ivins... go ahead and increase your prices but give diners more decent food portions. And for goodness' sake, please train your service staff

Located off Bukit Timah Road, th restaurant is always busy. Food is a rich cultural blend of Malay and Chinese cooking. Exceptional taste for ayam buah keluark, Babi tauyu, fish head asam, otak otak. Food was delicious and service quick. Desserts were equally tempting. Preferably make a reservation. You'll enjoy the experience.

My last visit to Ivins was 7 years ago. Drop by the restaurant with my wife last night. The place is as crowded and noisy as before. The menu was the same. We ordered Ayam Tempra, Sambal Kangkong, Tauhu Goreng and Pong Tauhu for mains. Standard was as good as before. For desserts, we ordered Chendol and Tausuan. Both were well done.I expected the prices to have gone up over the last so many years. To my surprise, it is still as affordable as before. The mains ranged between 4.20 to around 5.70 (except fishhead curry which as expected will be more pricey). And the dessert cost only 1.20!!! (even cheaper than drinking coffee at foodcourt). Total for my dinner : 24.10. Definitely worth it.Only grouse : No parking. In fact, I got summon for parking illegally opposite the restaurant
