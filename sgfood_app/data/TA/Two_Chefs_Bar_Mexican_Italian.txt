Nice location overlooking the water. The food was ok but not traditional Mexican. Indoor and outdoor seating

the moment you arrive until you leave edward takes very passionate and friendly care of you. we can recommend beef fajita and the chicken quesadilla. the virgin lime margarita is also great. two chefs, especially because of edward, is our favorite at quayside.

I arrived very late to hotel, they were very welcoming, the food was fantastic but there pina coladas were AMAZING #goodvibes

Another late dinner but happy this place was still opened (9.30pm on Friday). The guy attending to us was pretty chill and helpful. I quite like the food (thankful they have mix pizza) and another good place to chill with good company.

We visit this restaurant twice and the service, the food and the drinks are just perfekt. We give them Big 5 Stars.

We've lived in Sentosa a couple of years now and Two Chefs is by far our favorite of all the choices on Quayside. Great menu which they've recently added too, both the Italian and Mexican choices are huge and the quality is excellent. We have 2 children and both demolish the pizzas, our eldest says it's his favorite pizza in Singapore, and they're not small either. Personal favorite is the fajitas. Edward is always super friendly as are the other staff. Fun night out. Highly recommended

It’s hard to find a restaurant in Singapore Sentosa where NO GST CHARGES . We had fantastic service, good food and delightful atmosphere for a decent value. We will definitely come back and highly recommended restaurant for family and friends. Thumbs for the service team for giving us a great service.

We booked a table outside for a party well in advance. Just before we left for the restaurant we received a call to say it was too hot and squashed so we would have to be inside. On arriving outside was busy and inside was just us and clearly we had just been bumped inside where there wasn’t sufficient ventilation. Service was bad with wrong order brought twice. We also asked if there was a birthday desert and we were told they could provide a brownie. We were then charged s$48 for two brownie “birthday” deserts. Whole experience was very disappointing! Food was average

Friends and family friendly, choice of Italian and Mexican. Chicken Fajitas a favorite of us comes on nice sizzling platter with lots of onions and other veggie on it. This is the sort of place you would go to weekly, which is what we do. Price is reasonable enough. Staff is doing their best and most of times experience gives us nothing to worry about.

Great atmosphere and excellent food. Lot of choices form Mexican ,,& italian food munu. We ordered chicken fajita, pesto chicken pizza, Jamaican wings all are delicious

I love this place!! The food is amazing but particularly the service. Edward provides the best service I have experienced and I cannot recommend a place more highly

Awesome and relaxed place. Regulars at this place thanks to the great food, friendly service, and good deals (happy hour!!) Highly recommend with family !!

This is now a favourite of ours for Sunday dining. Great nacho's, chicken fajita's and beers. Edward and the team make you feel welcome and always helpful. Tried the carbonara penne this time and it was very good.

Dinner was strictly ok. Nothing great as such. The pesto pizza we called for had barely any pesto sauce. The chicken nachos had hardly any chicken. Went for a family outing but not really convinced

We recently just moved to Sentosa Cove, and as always, the first order of business is to check out what the area had to offer with regards to food. With numerous restaurants at the Quayside, we began to find ourselves frequent Two Chefs regularly, and any trip to Quayside meant we would be dining at Two Chefs. Edward always greets us with a smile and remembers us by name everytime we go. This personal and warm attitude shown by Edward is also shared by the team there. The food, almost as important as the people is always up to standard - we've never been disappointed there. Safe to say that whenever you're in Sentosa Cove, drop by Two Chefs, mexican or italian or both - the service and the experience never disappoints! Keep up the great work Edward and team! Best, Adib and Family

Our first dinner in Singapore was spent here. We walked along the marina boardwalk searching for somewhere to eat and returned back to this restaurant. The menu was filled with delicious dishes and was filled with people.We ordered the buffalo wings to share as an entree. They were delicious but very very hot. We were warned about how hit they were but decided to try them anyway. For main we had the chicken and beef fajitas. We received three tortillas, cheese, guacamole and tomato salsa. Extras can be purchased like sour cream etc. Staff are extremely friendly and offer a 10% discount for clients staying at W resort Sentosa
5
WOW You have a choice of Mexican (Fajitas are incredible) or Italian (Lasagna and pizza are remarkable). We have been several times and everything we have ordered was great. The service is the best I've had in Singapore. Ask for Edward, he was available for our every need from immediate drinks down to dessert. You don't want to miss this superb restaurant, great view, music, food and drinks

We live on Sentosa and eat at Quayside Isle often. Two chefs is probably the place we go to most often. Their Gourmet pastas are great and the wings as well(spicy and tasty!). But the biggest reason we go there is Edward - their main waiter who will always greet you with a big smile and take care of both adults and kids from the moment you take a seat. He makes the experience

We live at Sentosa and frequently visit Two Chefs because Edward who seems to single-handedly manage the place is always cheerful, welcoming. I've seen Edward recognise and remember the choice of drinks/food for several of their frequent patrons. We visit Two Chefs primarily because of Edward's excellent service. Could you please improve the quality of food? The chicken wings seem to be the frozen kind and were still quite raw inside. The beef nachos barely have any beef or cheese on it. The fajita bread served with the hot sizzling plate of grilled chicken is quite doughy and should at least be heated up before it's served. Can u also please improve the quality of the Prosecco and wines by the glass? We've started frequenting Fat Mama's restaurant more often as they have a much nicer range of wines by the glass. You have a great restaurant space and staff like Edward, just need to work on the quality of food and wine

Food is ok, beer and wine selection is ok but what makes this my first choice is the hospitality and attentiveness. Look for Edward and you’ll be more than satisfied.
5
Two Chefs is great, very friendly and attentive service from Edward and the team. They accommodate my son’s food allergies and we really like the choice they offer. It’s a good place for an early supper with a relaxed atmosphere!

We were staying at the W Hotel next door. We loved this restaurant. Friendly staff and great food. Much much better than the service at nearby Joe & The Juice.

My wife and I stayed at the W hotel in Sentosa arriving late and tired. Edward was very helpful with our meal choice and we ate there the following night as well. Would thoroughly recommend Two Chef's for quality and service.

My family ate here twice whilst in Sentosa staying at the W hotel. Lots of variety on menu, reasonably priced for Singapore and great service.

I have been dining in Singapore and Sentosa for several years and the service, quality of the food and value for money at The Two Chefs has been consistent.Recently spent a few days on Sentosa and ate at this place on three ocassion. The choice is great with steaks, Pasta, Pizza and Mexican to choose from.The service is friendly and helpful with the owner Edward always willing to go the extra step to make the experience one to remember.The enchilatas are a must for my 10 year old grandson followed by the Burritos.A couple of months ago I was at Sentosa for 5 weeks and again, spent a lot of time eating here. I have tried most of the restaurants at Quaside Isle but return to the Two Chefs on a regular basis

Found a place here in Sentosa with friends..came back here for the 4th time..simple but yet so awesome place to dine with..food was yummy and Super affordable value...So decided to shout out and let everyone find this amazing place here in Singapore ...Highly recommended ...food cravings satisfied ..

Food is overpriced vs value even for Sentosa. Mexican food is inedible, Italian is passable.Staff are inattentive and, frankly, rude. Safe yourself the effort and go somewhere else - plenty of choices in Sentosa

We ate here one evening while staying at the nearby W hotel. There's inside and outside seating looking over the cove. There's a good choice of Mexican and Italian food. The lasagne was very good but the fish (dory) was not very firm. Maybe it was frozen. The chips were fine. The service is attentive and the restaurant busy

Absolutely fantastic restaurant - great range , well priced . Staying at the W Sentosa and only a minute walk from hotel . Edward is a great host and has looked after us on both visits - and also makes the best Piña Coladas we have ever had . Still have another week left here on Sentosa and will definitely be back before we leave .
