Love the restaurant so much ! The food are so yummy . The service staff was awesome. Never seen such a friendly Executive Chef before. A special way for tossing Yu Sheng . Worth visiting the restaurant !

best dim sum in town with affordable price ! Must pick: siew mai and egg tarts
advisable to book before going as its always full
5
Never fail your expectations. Great store atmosphere, excellent service and of course the irresistible custard bun in town! Well spent weekend lunch with a bunch of friends!
5
Really good food, fast and friendly service. Just be careful that you don’t over order. Busy at weekends so advise that you book.
5
Needless to say, this is my all time favorite and only dim sum place i go in Singapore. Great service and friendly staff, excellent food and affordable price.
5
1 of the best place dim sum at affordable prices. Beautiful ambience to hang out with your friends and family too.
5
Excellent service and food I loved the whole ambience and the dim sum selection was amazing. Special recommendation for mango prawn mayo
5
We visited the restaurant, which is located at the Ion building, for dinner. If I would have to classify it, this is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. Extensive, but well-appointed decor throughout, clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant. Very comfortable sitting, nice tablecloth - all sets you in a mood. To prove that this is a fine dining restaurant, it offers a great wine selection, which includes practically all first growth Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, …), as well as Petrus, Massetto, DRC and if I was not mistaken, even a cult California Screaming Eagle. We had 2011 Rauzan-Sègla with our dinner, and the wine was outstanding after 20 minutes in the glass. Excellent service, starting with wine and food pairing recommendations. Considering our choice of wine, we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of Peking duck, as crispy duck is less sweet - and the recommendation was spot on, excellent pairing - also the duck was cooked perfectly. We also had tofu and green beans, each dish is excellent on its own. One of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce. We also had the dessert - fresh mango purée with an ice cream, which is also beautifully presented on top of the cold steaming bowl - another high point of the dinner experience.Once again, excellent service - prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. Definitely recommended
5
Dim sum is so awesome, it is even comparable or better than some of the 5 stars renowned hotels. Better still, at much affordable pricing as compared to dim sum at some chinese restaurants at hotels. Restaurant has great ambiance and service here is excellent. Highly recommend the baked pork pastry, custard bun, scallop chee cheong fun, har gao and mini egg tarts! Definitely an all time favourite for dim sum!
5
Place is clean and not super busy ....esp being pretty early for lunch time when I went. I liked how you can see in kitchen to watch Chefs preparing food.You are given a notepad to check off what items you want to order. I ordered pork dumplings in spicy chilli sauce and spring rolls.Food came out very quickly...first dumplings then the rolls.The chilli sauce was definitely "spicy".....love the big crunchy exterior on the spring rolls.They charge you for wet napkin (0.30sgd) and there is no dry tissue/napkins at table...so be prepared.This is second Asian restaurant I've gone that has no tissue/napkin when eating...as a Foreigner it's taking a little getting used to.Good place --Id go again and try different dishes next time
5
High quality food, excellent service. Nice music and conclusive environment. Definitely will return.
4
Looking for some nice dim sum in Orchard area and Taste Paradise met all my expectations. Delicious, quality, and friendly service. Nice family atmosphere too!
5
Great restaurant. Good service. Th staffs are very professional and the service is top class. Dim sum portions are decent with reasonable price. Will definitely come back here again
5
Had a great time at taste paradise. The xo carrot cake was awesome. Also, the service here is great! We messed up an order and the service staff gladly helped us to change it immediately.
4
The food quality standard is still pretty good. They do use fresh ingredients. The herbal soup tasted good whilst being nutritional but kind of steep in price at nearly $20 for a teeny bowl. My favourite is still the prawn rice roll served steaming hot.
2
Foods that fit for king.Best value for quality food.Great services!There are dim sum and chinese delicacy.The waiter are helpless to recommend what is the best food to try.Most dim sum comes in 3 serving. Do make sure to order extra portion for large family visit
5
Came for dimsum. the harkau, siew mai and dumplings are good quality, thin skin with lots of filling and flavour. also ordered the roasted pork and crackling pork, delicious, tender and juicy. the carrot cake is also good. the lava bun, mango dessert and avocado were average. highly recommend if you are craving for dimsum or roast pork. do call and make reservations in advance. Service was good
1
Booked for 4 adults and a child. The waiter had a grin when my wife ordered sautÃ©ed spinach with garlic because he thought it was not a good fit to our main course (is this the kind of service we were expecting in a luxury setup? No!). Then he tried to sell the full suckling pork instead of the half we ordered. This qualifies as hard sell because we needed more than one minute to make our point. Soups were okay. Crispy Thai tofu was good. When they brought the second serving of the suckling pork, we felt they left out a lot of meat. Weird. Overall the suckling pork and other side dishes were not up to our expectations. Summary: way too much expensive for the quality of the meal! We regret so much not taking our family to the Bosses at vivocity instead
3
Fantastic service as expected from any restaurant under the Paradise Group chain. I love that there are few tables in smaller private dining rooms for groups preferring privacy. Celebrated my mom's birthday successfully. Food was unique, fresh and top-notch (again, as expected from Paradise) Serving was a tad slow... took us about 2 hours to be served our 6 dishes. However, we joked that the time taken made it seem like a wedding banquet and laughed it off.
5
our first chinese meal in singapore was such a good one that we intend to go back when we visit singapore again. the shark fin soup was very good. lobster cooked three way was fantastic. the service staff was very friendly , worth a visit if you are into great chines foo
4
Quality for dimsum is great even though choices are limited. Back here for second time in one week for dim sum. And will be back agai to try other dishes
5
Excellent food and excellent service. Ambience was good. Fish, sweet sour pork, salted egg squid was good !
4
Large restaurant with wide varieties of dishes including Sichuan dishes had chicken and fried beans , service is quick and prompt busy place .For a quick lunch good place to go
5
Good location, nice place, food is always very tasty and the service are exceed expectation. Seafood are particular fresh with good light flavour. Better to make reservation for dinner on Friday night or dining during the weekends.
5
Personally, I prefer this than Din Tai Fung. Wide range variety of dim sum and Chinese food. Reasonable price. Suitable for large group of people. Better to reserve table first. They get super full at lunch time.
4
Food is unique and nice in taste paradise. Service is good and personal despite the 100% occupancy. We enjoyed ourselves at the dinner
3
Amazing shark fin and definitely will return soon. Great services and great locations with friendly stuff too
4
If you want to find a decent environment, excellent service and variety of Cantonese Style DIM SUM, this is the restaurant I highly recommended. I am Hong Kong ER working in Singapore for many year. This Cantonese style never disappointed me, my family and business partners. I highly recommended
5
My daughter and family live in Singapore and suggested we try a "new" place for Dim sum....well let me tell you. Taste Paradise in the ION complex is the best we have EVER tasted. Not only is it well presented and innovative but the decor and the people there make lunching there a true pleasure... we tried the specials and the standards and each was better than the last. We celebrated there 3 times in the period we were ther to become grandparents....a very special occasion made truly memorable for the shared taste of paradise.
5
I know it's very wrong to introduce this dish or even to rave about it ....but this place really serves the best sharks fin I've ever eaten. The sharks fin was served in a very hot stone bowl which can keep warm for at least 20 min, and a crispy spring roll serves as a accompaniment to the rich broth. Don't underestimate this inclusion as it provides a different texture to the thick tasty flavour of the broth. Dipping the spring roll provides a fine juxtaposition of the flavours. I had the cheapest version of sharks fin which was about S$50 a bowl but they have the $80 and $100 which comes with a whole comb of sharks fin. Perhaps in the future the restaurant can consider using abalone or geoduck instead of sharksfin. Then I'll come back less guilty and more often. By the way service is superb here. Tim sum are good too especially the XO carrot cake and crispy pork belly.
5
This is one of the better up-market Chinese restaurant in town. Serves very good sharksfin soup in hot stone, codfish and dim sum. Good service and fabulous dining environment.
3
If you are lookin for an excellent service team, this is the place. If you are looking for affordable Chinese food, skip this place.
Food was ok and bill was SGD98 for 2 pax.
5
It was a great dinner. Ambience was good, not noisy.
Food was very good. So was the service of the staff.
4
It was a pleasant evening to have dinner with my wife at this restaurant because of the food quality and excellent services rendered.
4
Went there for dim sum brunch. There was a long queue outside before opening times. All the tables were booked. The carrot cake is good, the fish porridge is good and the dim sums were outstanding
4
Was brought here by a friend, who worked near Ion and often ate here. Great selection of dim sum. Xiao Long Bao were wonderful as were the steamed buns. Very reasonably priced for 3 people. Very nice dim sum if you're looking for a change from DTF
4
It has been quite a few years since I last lunched at Taste Paradise.On both Tuesday and today, had lunch there and the food is excellent in general. Unfortunately, the Manager on duty had a rather strange disposition that made him seem rather offensive to us today - seemingly rude, condescending, leaving a rather unpleasant aura around us. But, yet he also left us feeling that it was not intentional and as we left, that ill feeling was gone, at least for me.Apart from that odd personnel experience, I would recommend dining there. The spicy carrot cake with bean sprout, the soup of the day, vermicelli with egg white and a dash of vinegar (optional) are excellent.While the beancurd with wagyu beef 'wrap' was interestingly and aesthetically presented, I was left having to cleanse my palette of the oily residue - I felt that I was drench in oil inside my mouth. As much as I love the presentation, flakey and crispy texture, I don't think I could ever have it again - a shame, delicious but drench in oil - the very reason why I could not make myself take a photo of it as pretty as it was. Using the teacup saucer as a base for the noodle bowl was not a little turn-off for us as it makes the bowl wobble - making us having to ensure it doesn't quite topple over not that it would.The experience is rather a catch 22 experience. Would I return again, most probably to try out the other dishes though I changed my mind about booking it for 6 for Father's day on 18th.I do recommend this restaurant
5
Went on a weekday afternoon for a late dim sum lunch. Ambience was great, perfect for couples or even a meal with friends. Service was excellent and our food came pretty quickly, partly because it was busy. Their dim sum was as good as I remembered it to be. Slightly more pricey than your average dim sum place, but I'd say it's worth it. Not my first time here, and definitely not my last
5
Still one of my favorite dim sum places in Singapore with friendly staff that let you sit a lil longer if there's still some room left for the following seating to take the places. All foremost though the food is outstanding with my favorites being the slightly sweet custard buns, crispy and bbq (chashu) pork and everything cheung fun. Awesome stuff in a classic ambience
4
We dined here to enjoy their signature sharksfin in stone bowl. But service was disappointing- no pepper or vinegar or coriander and bean sprouts which are the expected condiments. Before we finished this steaming hot soup, they insisted on serving us the next course. Placed the next course in front of us to stare at till we were ready to move on
5
The dim sum was fantastic and very good and the service is excellent, definitely recommended this place
5
Nice ambience, great service.. quality food except for the lobster udon a bit salty. Will be back again.
5
I highly recommend the peking duck, crispy pork, wasabi prawns and the pomelo sago for dessert!
Service is good and prices reasonable for the quality of food.
4
The food is nice and just good for moderate experience or expectation. Very Cantonese style which I like since I am one haha
Good for a one time visit :)
5
I have always love Paradise Group's food. Never fail me. The most unforgettable at Taste Paradise was the stone bowl Shark's Fin thick soup. The remaining dishes were up to standard too. I'll definitely return again.
5
Came here to relax and have some ME time. Love the attentive service from the ladies. Food was yummy, especially like the shrimp paste sambal aka Hae Bee Hiam, was addictive and it goes well with the fried rice and Pork Dish. Love the refreshing chilled Aloe Vera and lemongrass jelly in lemonade and sour plum.
4
Has been there a few time, just go there for their dim sum. The foods consider good taste so far, service level also not bad.Before you go please make an appointment so that you don't have to wait too long during peak hour.After your foods, you can relax and shop around at orchard areas until you drop.,...
5
There are always too many good dishes to choose from. On this visit, there was a lobster broth with rice promotion. You need pay only S$1 for the S$32 dish which is good for 2 persons. Order an addition dish for every person for sharing for a satisfactory meal. Like the old MacDonald advertisement, everything is my favourite
2
We ordered a few dishes - ribs, duck, chicken, vegetables and tofu. Also ordered the lobster porridge which was at a promo price of $1. Felt that the taste of the food was sub-par, considering the price. Quite impressive at first look due to the decor - expectations were raised. But the taste of the food really fell short. Definitely can get better Chinese food at more reasonable prices
4
Taste of Paradise might be an overstatement but it does taste good, not exceptional but overall a very solid Chinese restaurant.Tried quite a few dishes and the personal favourite was the ribs in plum sause, overall food merits 4.5/5 stars.What disappointed was the fact that there were no dim sums whatsoever, granted that they have them for lunch but at least a basic selection for dinner would be appropriate. Heard great things about their custard bun and had my heard crushed upon hearing that it is available only for lunch.Service was good and attentive. One negative was the aircon firing at full blast and making it a Shangai Polar experience... nonetheless a pleasant place and definitely recommend
4
Very good and fresh ingredients used for the dim sum. Prices are reasonable but could be better if no. of pieces can match the no. of pax.
4
This is my first time to this beautiful restaurant and nice atmosphere. Romantic and dim lighting. We enjoyed our food very much, cooked to perfection and yet the price is right.
4
from the charm of the receptionist, to the service and great choice of dim sum, it is always a great experience
4
Great ambience. Love the classy crockery and table setting. Specially ordered their 'famous' XO carrot cake which was highly recommended, but it was a huge disappointment. Thank goodness the other dim sum dishes and the good service made up for it.
2
I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the food, level of service, price and the Group's misrepresentation of it's ala carte menu. I had checked the website before and downloaded the normal a la carte menu. We had booked a table for 9th Feb which was still in the CNY festive period. We did not want the CNY menu as we had already done our Reunion dinner and were looking for a good Teochew meal. I had made the booking on behalf of my uncle and was horrified to see a completely different ala carte menu, According to the staff it was the ala carte menu and not the CNY menu. We did not find the prices justified by the quality of the food. It was OK but not worth it. For the same price we could have done better at Wan Hao, Li Bai or Jade. Although there was plenty of staff around and they were prompt and responsive, for a fine dining restaurant I found the actual quality of service no better than a zhi char stall. The waitress did not even excuse herself when she bent across the table to clear the plates. My poor uncle had to lean backwards and away from her as she reached across to my placing. The first few dishes came so quickly they were placed helter-skelter on the table. I don't call that fine dining. Where is the finese that comes with the decor? This is the third time our family has been disappointed by the Group's performance. It's reputation is way over-rated and most of all, it is very misleading for a restaurant of this level to not mention that it's normal ala carte menu is not available for the CNY period. I feel terribly cheated as there were items on the normal ala carte menu that I was looking forward to and we ended up with a much smaller selection which was paltry. This is truly a third strike for the Paradise Group. We decided that three was one time too many and Paradise as a group is off our list. If you truly are looking for good food and fine dining this is not the place to go to
5
Liked all the dim sums (two types of steamed dumplings, chicken feet, steamed and baked "char siu pao", XO carrot cake, spring rolls - a little disappointed that there were cabbage in them, and fried enoki mushrooms) and the suckling pig, but the highlight was the braised vermicelli (there is only one on the menu, can't miss it). We tried that because our usual noodle choice ("hor fun" with "smooth eggs" and "shrimp balls" - literal translation in case any adventurous visitors want to give it a try) wasn't available. Really enjoyed it and will try the fried vermicelli next time
4
the room is abit dark, dark brown curtains, dark brown rugs, and if they spruce up lighter, this would be fabby. Food is very good, dim sum delicate and well seasoned, sell stuffed, mains are well done. Delicate flavors. expensive, but worth it. service is very good
3
Nice warm cosy interior with beautiful blue white chinaware. We ordered the set dinner menu at 58$ per person. I enjoyed the food but the portions were tiny and was left hungry after finishing the 6 course set. Crackling pork belly was delicious. Fish maw soup was interesting. As far as the food goes, I did enjoy the meal.However, I had encountered so many bad moments of service that it was hard to let things slide. It started when I arrived at the door step on the 4th level on Ion and was met by the hostess. I told her I was joining my friends who were already inside the restaurant. Understandably to help locate my friends' table quickly, she asked for their names. When she could not find their names, she asked me if I had the right restaurant. Oddly, I said yes unit 04-07. I had to insist to her that I had the right restaurant and I had to insist that my friends were inside for sure but I clearly sensed her resistance to let me in and had to deliberately take a step forward and proceeded in to look for my friends. I felt very unwelcome to say the least. I believe the guests should always be given the benefit of the doubt and that the hostess could have been more welcoming in her approach which was cold and unfriendly. Now seated and into our third course, the same young waitress attending our table appeared to be in a hurry when it came to clearing our plates. At one point while still holding my chopstick and chewing my bite of food I had lifted from my plate and placed in my mouth, the waitress suddenly appeared and grabbed my plate from under me and shoved the bowl of rice which was already on the table in front of my plate, closer to me. I was so rudely interrupted while in the midst of eating that it clearly upset me but she was oblivious to what she had just done. Another complaint I have is that throughout the evening, all the service staff were bumping into my chair which was extremely annoying. I did not have the heart to tell any of the staff as I was in the company of friends and really did not want to be unpleasant but I hope this review will be noted by the restaurant so they can improve on the service
3
We ordered the vegetarian dishes. The sweet and sour dough vegetarian dish was very good and vegetable dishes taste great. Food serving is quite small for its price. Service was good. We do realise the restaurant sells shark fins. We believe in patronizing restaurants that are more environmentally friendly. With the first International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of oceanic sharks names 64 species as endangered, we will try our best not to patronize this place if possible
5
No, it is not a dessert, with cream cheese frosting, but a bite size of heaven! My host did the ordering and every selection-12 of them for two people were Devine!!! Always bring an appetite when dining with your Asian friends... there is always so much good food! Whatever you do, don't fill up on the appetizers, because I can guarantee that there will be half a dozen more delicious dishes to try!! The Mango jelly served on top of dry ice is an eye and palate pleaser for ending a wonderful meal!
3
This place serves decent Chinese food. Service is good. Ambience is typical Chinese restaurant......
4
We can see why this restaurant was so busy at a bit of an out of the way area.
Really liked the crispy sweet and sour pork. Also this is a very clean restaurant.
4
Taste paradise has innovative chinese cuisine in a plush environment. Always one of my favourite chinese restaurants in Singapore. I would come here more if they waived wine corkage as I usually bring my own bottle of wine.
5
Superb dim sum in a classy environment. We love the Shangai Bun, Fried carrot cake (the best). The queue can be a bit long so it is best to come early.
4
Nice food, good service, yes it's pricey but worth it , very authentic food . Located on 5 floor of ION Orchard
4
Overall both the quality of the dim sum and service support are good compared to other restaurants. We tried a variety like steamed dumplings, porridge, baked and deep fried puffs. Aside from a xo rice roll which I'd suggest to skip, please give the others a try. The ones definitely not to miss out are the century egg porridge, baked char siew pastry and taro puff.
5
Came here on out last day in Singapore and my goodness what a treat! Had the best freshly made dim sum and finished off with the famous Xo cake. Would definitely recommend to dim sum lovers out there! Couldn't fault any of it. Staff were very welcoming and attentive. We enjoyed the whole experience
4
Do note that not all restaurants under the Taste Paradise serve dim sum. But this one does. And my kids love dim sum, hence we have tendency to keep coming back here for good dim sum.So far, we have tried all sorts and they have not failed to deliver. Only complaint would be the long wait, especially on the weekends. Won't even try to walk in. Too long a wait. The cheong fun (char siew and prawn) were good, egg tarts too.. in fact we tried so many that it'd be hard to list. Enjoy!
4
The dim sum is fantastic and some dishes it is famous for are the XO sauce fried carrot cake and poached noodles with egg white and crab meat. They are also our family favorites!A minor problem is the dim lighting in the restaurant, which makes it difficult to take nice photos of the fantastic food or even selfies
5
Taste Paradise has a pretty good range of options for dimsum compared to many other restaurants that serve dimsum in Singapore, but still lags behind the variety available in restaurants in Hong Kong. But Taste Paradise does its dimsum well and some of the items we liked include: XO carrot cake, har gao (shrimp dumpling), steamed rice roll with char siu (roast pork), salted egg yolk buns, roast pork. Service was prompt and good. Overall I would recommend Taste Paradise to other diners, but don't expect it to be a cheap eat. Average expenditure would be about S$30-50 per person if you don't order seafood dishes
5
We had to wait 45 minutes to get a table but it was definitely worth it. Lots of really awesome dishes to choose from. We were extremely impressed. Would definitely look to go again next time we're in Singapore.
4
We enjoyed the preperation as they were out of the ordinary and the presentation was also very good. The ambience is decent and its best to call beforehand for reservations as the place gets really busy. Would strongly recommend the vegetable fried rice with diced vegetables, the chicken and cashew nuts preperation, the spicy radish starter, the starter shaped like mini pigs with a hint of custard, the pumpkin starter is worth experimenting and the tofu is silken and exquisite. There is an annual membership program by paying SGD 30. Bon apetit
3
We sat down and ordered food. I was asked if we would like all the food together to which I replied yes. In actual fact each dish came every 3-5 minutes not together at all ! The food was however, very good, tasty and well presented if not actually delivered together ! I had not realised that they hard Shark Fin dishes on the menu, if I had I would not have entered the restaurant as I believe the activity of finning Sharks is inhumane and needs to be banned globally. For that reason alone I cannot recommend this restaurant if you are at all concerned for the welfare of sharks
4
An old friend and I met up for dinner last Friday at Taste Paradise. As there were only 2 of us, we decided to go for the 2-person set menu at $98+++ per person, 5 dishes in total.The appetizer was a delicately presented trio of foie gras, Peking duck skin and wasabi prawn. All 3 items were cooked just right - foie gras was tender inside but crispy outside, the duck skin was sliced thinly and beautifully crisped, wasabi prawn delivered just the right amount of punch without overpowering.Second dish was the braised shark's fin in claypot. Not our preferred dish, we would have gone for a non-fin alternative if this was available on the menu. The broth came bubbling in the claypot with sizeable pieces of fins. The soup tasted nice albeit slightly too thick for my liking.Next up was the stir-fried chives with shredded conpoy. This was one of the forgettable dish. I didn't find anything special about this one.The final dish before dessert was the Ee Fu noodles with half-lobster. The noodles seem to have been stir-fried with XO sauce and was rather spicy. I ate the half-lobster but did not finish the noodles. Probably not a dish suitable for young children.Dessert was mango sago. It came sitting atop a bowl of dry ice, making it look spectacular when smoke started pouring out. This one had just the right level of tanginess and sweetness and I enjoyed the small dessert portion.Overall, I guess the set menu was ok, a mix of tasty dishes and forgettable ones. Service was also quite prompt. Staff are generally attentive and cleared the dishes efficiently.
5
This is the finest Singapore restaurant I've witnessed. A tremendous variety all well done. Some high end touches but it doesn't forget to feed you plenty of good food as well. Make sure you're on a hefty expense account, though since this is a high dollar place.In the heart of Singapore, only the street food is cheap
5
I love the ambience of this restaurant, as well as the large variety delicious chinese dishes they have here. My personal favourite is the Kim Sa Bao, I haven't found any restaurant have it as good as they do here. I can have 8 pieces in one sitting
5
Came to eat here with my family and we ordered the set menu. Service per person is small (much like French food) but still enough to make us full at the end of the meal. You can order additional dishes to share.The decor in the restaurant is nice and cosy. Service is also good as they clear your plates quickly once you are done and food is served without waiting too long.The desserts are nice as well.
3
Without a booking and looking for some good Asian food, we arrived late in the evening for a family dinner. The restaurant in the lovely Ion Shopping Centre looked ordinary from the outside but the menu seemed good. It was difficult to order as we had little help and I do agree with other comments that they seemed to be geared to their local regulars and not particularly interested in newcomers. With children, it was easier to order the whole roast chicken - but it was disappointingly very small. The fried rice was ordinary and not particularly good. The noodle dish nothing special. It is high-end in price and does not offer a very friendly service
5
Our family dinner this week brought us to this restaurant. It is one of the best restaurant for Chinese fine dinning in Singapore . The service was marvellous and the food was great. The ordered again the Peking duck which was the best. The wasabi prawns was fantastic too. The family wallop all the nine dishes that we ordered. My last Daughter simply loved the salted egg cutter fish . No regrets , thus restaurant ranks high on the list for good food and service , no question !!
4
Probably the best place to get good food in the sprawling Ion mall, if you like Cantonese food. It's authentic and also has some high-end creative food like fried ramen with lobster . I was here for lunch again and the dim sum was good - Cheong fun, roast pork belly, baked pork buns and carrot cake with XO sauce
4
This restaurant is one of Good restaurant and usually they quite crowded and the taste of the meals also very nice and delicious. Mostly when we come here, we must queue. The decoration of the restaurant is nice, the staff is good and fast.
5
we have dinner in here with some friends, no booking luckily accepted, the food was great, however we can sit long as the staff will try to ask you to leave once you finish eating
5
Came here to try out their Peking Duck. It was nicely roasted and wrapped with their home made flour skin. The extra meat was stir fried with water chestnuts which made the second dish crunchy. We had the meat wrapped with chilled snow lettuce. It was a great combination. One place to go for Peking Duck.
3
Agree with previous review, this restaurant is not tourist friendly and focuses on corporate and local clients, Singapore such a friendly place but found staff were not and very hard to get servers attention as too busy focused on corporate clients, most of which come from the offices housed in the same building. Will avoid on next visit to Singapore. Also watch out for double services charge, which they also tried to get us to pay twice on our bill
4
Good food, but service wanting as staff noticeably very focus on their Asian customers and others find it hard to get consistent attention, which lets this restaurant down. We visited twice and really struggled to get services or our orders in timely way on both occasions. Also watch out for double service charge as 10% automatically added to bill but blank space at bottom of bill for tips, which server always point to when handed the bill, so could easily pay this twice if not checked
4
We visited this restaurant for reunion dinner and they provided a really good dining experience. Overall, very well done. DÃ©cor and ambiance were top-notch. A lot of thought went into the overall decorations. The reunion dinner meal had a lot of the typical dim sum selections for CNY (including abalone and others). The waitresses provided a relaxed meal (did not feel hurried or rushed). Food quality was high
4
Have been here for many meals, dim sum selection is wide and well done. Had CNY eve lunch here day, managed to get a table and they still offer ala carte menu on top of the set menu. Service is excellent and the ambience is nice and quie
4
Our youngest daughter completed her A Level exams and we took her to Taste Paradise for a nice meal. We have been there several times and made sure we arrived early enough to avoid the usual long peak hour wait. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes even though we arrived at 6:30pm on a weekday! But the wait was worth it. The food as always, is very tasty and satisfying. The ambience is comfortable and allows great conversation. Service is quite good considering the number of people that are being served during meal times. I know we'll be back again quite soon
3
Heard about the good dim sum here so we booked a table in advance. Food was good but a bit too expensive. Service wasn't good though. Was served water in a chipped glass. Not something that is expected from a place like this where service is supposed to be top notch. Price was on the high side too. Waited really long for the bill to arrive at the end. Perhaps it's due to the public holiday.
4
In terms of restaurant chains, TP and imperial treasure are probably the best for dim sum. Today didn't disappoint again . We had a selection of the usual favorites - roasted meats, pork puffs, custard buns, carrot cake etc. They were all very good. We also tried something unusual/local which was beancurd skin in laksa sauce, that was pretty good to
5
Must try the shark fin with shark bone soup. The best Chinese restaurant and probably one of the most successful restaurant group in Singapore
3
Taste Paradise if renowned for it's coloured Dim Sum, which comes in different flavours. A bold experiment with food, brings out some innovativeness and excitement to tingle that tastebud of yours to the otherwise (boring) Xiao long bao.
4
A good restaurant to yum cha or dim sum session with friends and family. When it is busy time, the service standard will drop as the server tend to ignore and show u the stop sign when i want to past them my order.
4
where to start? carrot cake, pork belly, the dumplings, crispy duck, literally everything is delicious at this somehow fine dining place of taste group. make reservations in advance as its always packed!
5
The food here is great and I have no complaints about it, but you do need to book in advance as there can be crowds, especially during lunch and dinner.

Not impressed with the quality of food. The restaurant serves more SzeChuan style food. Xiao Long Bao is the signature dish with options of different flavored fillings. Other than that, the rest of dishes were just average. The worst has to be the Yang Zhou Fried Rice. The simplest to cook yet most difficult to master. Rice was wet and the cook obviously forgot about seasoning. One look at the dish and you know something is not right
5
Walking down the alley reminds me of walking into another dimension like in Macau style Casino restaurants, In main hall where smoking is allowed it somehow resembles Casino lisboa gambling den, a bit smokey however we were ushered to a private room dining with limited tables in a sound proof environment. The Tea connoiseeur Guy was well versed in tea selection and the Dim sum was best ever in such quite serene sound ambience. Food was hot nad crisp and the most fulfilling brunch ever 
4
Visited for lunch and we had a really pleasant meal. Service was friendly and personable. The baked BBQ pork pastry is a must try and so is the steamed salted egg custard buns. Both were luscious and delish! However we did find that the dishes were a bit more salty than what we are used to. We were quite thirsty after. Perhaps it is advisable to request them to go easy on the seasoning the next time we visit
4
Came here late (10:30pm), and luckily they welcomed us for dinner, for which they deserve credit since most other places were closed in the ION mall. Had a large selection of Chinese food. My only complaint is that they did not stop us from ordering as the portions were large and we could not nearly finish our food. Century egg was exceptional and reasonably prices (SGD 8.80). Not so the bird nest (SGD 68). Fried rice crab meat was worth its SGD 24. In the end, without wine, we spent SGD 205, a bit on the steep side but the ambiance is good and the service friendly and helpful
5
I last came to this restaurant quite some time ago, and I had a business lunch here recently. The restaurant has new additions to their menu.Here are the items that we had:- XO Carrot Cake: $9.80. Pan fried carrot cake, bean sprouts with XO sauce. It’s a little spicy, so definitely not for those who can’t take chilli. A good dim sum to order.- Szechuan Pan-seared Foie-Gras: $18 per portion. The foie gras is pan-seared and drizzled with a homemade Szechuan sauce. This gave the dish a mildly spicy kick. Unique Asian perspective.- Shark Cartilage Soup with Assorted Seafood in Young Coconut: $24. This soup has been slow-cooked for 6 hours and was rich. It had a variety of seafood – prawn, fish and scallop in it, which were fresh. This was a highlight for the meal.- Soon Hock Fish: This was filleted, deep fried and topped with thin-sliced pork cooked in house-style sauce that is flavoured with dry orange peel.- Pan-seared Kurobuta Pork with ‘Dang Gui’ sauce: $22 per portion. The dish tastes good. The Dang Gui herb gave a nice flavour to the pork and the herbal flavour is not overwhelming. Recommended!- Green Dragon Vegetables: ‘Qing Long Cai’. Its stir-fried with garlic and garnished with deep fried scallops. It was crunchy and reminds me a lot of ‘tow-gay’/ bean sprouts. A unique vegetable to order and it has a refreshing taste. - Poached Rice with Assorted Seafood in Lobster Broth: $32. This is like a lobster bisque without the cream. It had rice in it, so its like eating Teochew porridge. There were diced prawns and scallops in it, making it a dish to remember for a long time.- Trio of Desserts: -- Pumpkin Pastry. This was coated with sesame and deep fried. Its nice. -- Black glutinous rice with Coconut ice cream: Served in a glass bowl and you eat with a small spoon. Every mouthful a delight!-- Chilled Mango Sago: Cold and refreshing dessert to cleanse the palate and end the meal.I like that the desserts are small, allowing me to savour a wider range of desserts, with each having different textures and flavours, allowing for variety. The food quality is good and dishes are unique.A great meal and I recommend this restaurant for those looking for a good Cantonese cuisine

Great tasting dim sum but a bit stressful with the crowds. Order up front or else your orders won't come till much later. A la carte is expensive but dim sum is not.
5
Always order the executive set if going in smaller groups.
Love the Tim sum, cod fish and never miss the fish meat noodle.
Sharksfin in a hotpot is always on our top list.
Amazing food and you will leave feeling very wholesome.
2
3 different items chosen, all not available but only told after at 10minutes wait. Ridiculous. Food lukewarm, not excellent for the REALLY high price we paid, and VERY poor welcome from staff clearly wanting to close. Avoid
4
Enjoy this restaurant every time I come even though it is slightly expensive for what we get. This time round we tried some of the more non-traditional Chinese dishes like the foie gras with blueberry which was so good and rich. Their bamboo claim had the crunchy element to match with the other black beans so it was a nice juxtaposition. Truffle noodles with the lobster pincer was good value at $15/portion. They also had the traditional dim sum dishes like the XO carrot cake which was delectable and decent renditions of the other dim sum or more traditional Chinese dishes. However, it is true that some dishes are not as good as Imperial Treasure such as their sa-bor fish
3
Food wise, it could be because we went for dinner and not dim sum, which other reviewers seem to like. The set menu with their so-called signature dishes was uninspiring. However, what motivated me to write this review was the poor service. When the dessert arrived, we realised that the two dessert items did not correspond to what was in the set menu. The waiter did NOT alert us when we ordered that they could not serve the dessert as stated in the set. Worse, the waiter did NOT inform us when the dessert was served that they had changed the ingredients and the dessert items as well. To me, this showed a lack of integrity. It was only when we queried that the restaurant admitted the dessert items had been changed, claiming that the fruit was sourish. They refused to give a discount, though they gave two mango puddings to compensate. BTW, the mango puddings were also very uninspiring - we tasted more pudding than mango. Overall, a disappointing experience giving the hype surrounding this restaurant
1
Seriously,this place is not good at all. First experience was terrible; gave it another try and also not good; last night was the third try and one last chance - food is really bad, service very average and not cheap. Sorry, have to write this place off, even for free
4
This is definitely the place for dim sum (if you are willing to pay slightly more). All of them were done perfectly, yummy.If you like char siew sou (叉燒酥), you have to try it here. I think the custard bun (流沙包) was one of the best in town. The deep-fried taro dumpling (芋角) was soft and fluffy
4
In a city full of dim sum restaurants, it takes something special to stand out, but Taste Paradise certainly does. The menu takes classic Cantonese dishes and funks them up - for example the Century Egg with Lime Sherbert Granita was a taste sensation.It was the most expensive Chinese restaurant we have eaten in (in Singapore) but it was worth - probably for a special event rather than a regular dinner
4
Taste Paradise offers interesting dim sum variations that are still agreeable to traditional diehards. Elegant interior decors in warm tones provide an upmarket ambience. Portrait paintings on the wall subtly remind the steep traditions of dim sum and yum cha.We ordered a light selection of dim sum and we enjoyed their freshness and delicate tastes. Items were well-portioned and did not stinge on good quality ingredients. The seafood hor fun had good wok hei and was prepared with generous seafood items. Despite the specified dining periods, we had a leisurely lunch and did not feel hurried to finish our meal on time
3
In my opinion the top Chinese restaurant at (possibly) the top shopping mall on Orchard Road is not even top 10 among Chinese eateries in Singapore. You pay for the opulent (and a bit flashy) décor. Unusual dishes, with a touch of modernity, ranging from OK to good, but far from satisfying and not sufficiently refined. The chefs love sugar, because many dishes have a sweet, sometimes inappropriate, touch. Maybe it is to help you battle the cold temperature in the dining room?
4
They have the best peking duck here in Taste Paradise. Even better than the ones in China and Hong Kong. Lunch dimsum is excellent. Amazing crab fried rice. Really nice ambiance too.
1
We went there because its famous for its Dim Sum. We ordered two drinks.. looked through the Menu and saw that they sell Shark fin soup. immediately left. the act of finning a shark while the creature is still alive is barbaric and cruel and sharks may go extinct as finning decimates population. why do educated people still want to eat it???dont go there
4
We've all tried combinations that leave you wondering--"Why??" but here at Taste Paradise they have created some wonderful combinations that will leave you wanting more. Fois gras with Blueberry Reduction, Asparagus with truffle oil and Chinese mustard vinaigrette works beautifully. Everything we tasted on the extensive Dim Sum Menu was delicious, especially the Century Egg with Lime Sherbert Granita. Great to experience something new amid traditional Chinese flavours
5
My friend, who is a local in Singapore, invited me for lunch at this lovely restaurant, at the top floor of a very posh shopping centre, right at the heart of Singapore. Excellent spot, as it is great to eat, then go for a shopping spree with so many fantastic shops and brands!We ordered a selection of dim sums, and they were blissful, but the must have according to my friend, is this Crackling Pork belly, which this restaurant has the unique talent to get to the right crispy point, and it was delightful! We also had smoked duck spring rolls, prawns dumplings, prawns steamed rice CheongFun, and deep fried prawns (yes I told her i love prawns! :-)and we had the lovely chestnut tea, which apparently is used to cool you down in the equatorial temperatures of Singapore in the Winter, and mix that with Jasmine tea, which warms you up when the aircon is too freezing...ah and she ordered this "Steamed Custard Bun" which she said, was her daughter's favourite! She told me how you eat it, you bite it, then you suck the custard that comes bleeding off of the warm bun... It is absolutely special! I loved it
4
We were brought here by my cousins in Singapore so we knew we were in for a treat. The entrance is grand, decked out in lush oriental decor with portraits of imperial emperors. Service was efficient and polite but a little cold (pretty typical in Singapore though).The yum cha selection was vast and each dish was beautifully petite and delicious. We didn't have room for desserts but they looked very impressive from what we could see was being served to tables around us. Booking is absolutely essential judging from the line outside. Recommended
4
This restaurant provides a modern twist to traditional cantonese fare with excellent presentation of the food. The crab stuffed scallops were very good but the abalone did not seem as fresh. The fois gras salad and wasabi prawns are also very good. We tried fried durien for the first time and it deserves its reputation as the smelliest fruit on earth
5
With the Orchard Road Christmas lighting as a backdrop coupled with delicious food & good service makes the family dinner more enjoyable and memorable!! Vegetarian dishes are served here too. Peking duck is recommended as well.Ask for tables near the glass panels facing Orchard Road!
4
A pleasant lunch with multiple plates. They are trying to market themselves as a 'chinese tapas' sort of establishment thought they also have an extensive a la carte menu. Their dim sum list is quite normal with a couple of highlights... a Foie Gras Xiao Long Bao (perfectly executed) and some fried prawns with Avocado.In general the food is well prepared, well executed and served very quickly. I would recommend it as a good place if you are in the vicinity, for a business lunch. So to be fair, Id need to come back, completely hungry, with a batallion of friends to truly go deep into their menu. They had some deep fried Beijing Lamb chops that I wish I could have tried.The nice thing about Taste Paradise is that they are trying to bring in some innovation without totally departing from the spirit of the classics.Definitely worth a visit. Spend time exploring their menu and picking out the 'odd ones
5
Fantastic place to have a nice dim sum lunch on a Sunday. The Shanghai dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), baked Char Siew buns and fried rice are just excellent and very good value. Service is also very good and it is a child-friendly restaurant too. Make reservations and go on an empty stomach
4
We were a large group of people went for Chinese New Year dinner with reservation and it was fully packed because of CNY time. All the variety of food right from the soup starters to full meal was awesome! I have skipped quite a few from the meal but everythjng had a great taste
5
I would definitely return. The food quality, quantity and price was superb. The interior décor is reminiscent of the dragon ceremony.
3
The service was not great, the food only average at best so I don't understand why it was so busy and why we had to wait to get a table.
5
Amazing range, great service and fantastic setting for group dinner. Good for formal dinners where you want to impress your guests. The service was impeccable.
5
Stone pot soup, dim sum dishes, ala-carte menu & aloe Vera jelly dessert are good.
Worth your calories & $$$.
4
Try to go early as the restaurant gets pretty busy and sometimes you need to wait just a "teeny bit" longer to get the service. Apart from this, the quality of food is always consistently yummy!
5
Excellent experience of chinese cuisine. Very attentive and efficient staff. Good quality food. Highly recommended

Seeing the good ratings we tried this place after having gone to Imperial Treasure noodle & congee Hse (on level B3) the day before. Overall I prefer the food of imperial Treasure which is cheaper too.Here we ordered 8 dishes. The best was the custard bun, better than that of Imp Treasure as it had less butter and more salted egg yolks. It was more runny too and not overly rich.The savoury dishes were generally over seasoned, too tasty but had good flavours. The cold noodles with truffles was nice and delicate. The cod fish with miso sauce was really salty but fish was well cooked, tender and flavoursome. The century congee was ordinary and too salty. The smoked duck springroll was ordinary but the skin was light and crispy. The deep fried prawn and almonds wasn't good, prawn ball was too soft without much body or texture. The radish cake in XO sauce was very tasty with a good balance but the radish cake again was too soft eventhough it has a firm fried outer layer to support it; it was almost creamy. The steamed bean curd with truffles was tasty. Overall was good but too salty. Our bill for 8 dishes came up to S$80 for 2 persons. The decor was too heavy and overdone and lighting too dim. There were many waiters and waitresses and were very good at refilling our teacups. The waitress we called to take our orders had to call another to do it and we had to wait for her for a while. Whenever a dish is served, the kitchen hand comes out with the food and has to wait for a waiter/waitress to come and 'unveil' it and place it on our table, like serving a king. Quite unnecessary, I felt, especially for dim sum lunch. For that price, I expected better food and more efficient service, thus the 3 out of 5
3
Service was average at best and even though as diners we tried to be friendly, the response was lukewarm. The Peking duck was very good. Besides that the rest of the dishes were average at best and in some instance, poor attempts to hype up otherwise simple ingredients best enjoyed when their natural flavors are allowed to shine through. I think it could be the high rental of the shop premises, the seafood prices were exorbitantly expensive. Both my Spanish friend and I who enjoy a good Cantonese/Chinese meal will not visit it again
4
When we first moved to Singapore we really felt like 'yum cha' so we headed out one Sunday morning and were surprised that everything was closed. We hung around ION on Orchard until the shops and restaurants started opening. Taste Paradise opened around 11am.This is a nice place for an early lunch on Sunday or diner any time. Nice Cantonese with a local touch. Good quality food and good service. Nice decor. If you're here for dinner, try the salted egg coated prawns and the Pekinog duck. For lunch, try the carrot cake - it's a savoury dish made from 'white carrot' which is like a radish, tastes like a potato cake fried with a little egg. Make sure you have it with some chilli sauce.
3
If you ask for recommendations they just blurt out the most expensive things like scallops, foie gras etc.We already ordered the foie gras and peking dusk and the hostess recommended scallops, crabs, lobster, etc. Uh i don't want to die of a cholesterol overload in a restaurant.Foie gras appetizer was so-so. Peking duck was good. 2nd dish on Peking duck we opted for noodles (add $12). Broccoli with crab roe and crab was really good. Black pepper steak also great. Mango sago dessert was really good too.
3
We were there during lunch and had to wait for 30 mins before we have a table. The food was average . The only dish that we enjoyed was the custard buns.
Service was average.
3
Although Taste Paradise has good quality Cantonese food, their quality is gradually dropping. Have been eating here the past few Chinese New Year and found the food quality coming down.
5
I love this place... My husband and I visit this restaurant frequently as located in city.... Easy for an after work dinner... I love the menu... Always packed with locals.... Love their bamboo dish...
5
Today visit was not a mistake - all planned. my first mistake was a mistake and it was a good mistake!! lol. We tried the dim sum .. this time round. if I am not wrong, it was the Shanghai style of dim sum. Love the creamy yellow stuff in the bun .. it feels so good in the mouth.. Next time, I will order 2 sets .. this bun goes out fast.. the lotus rice is sooooo good.. based on my experience, this is the best dim sum restaurant that i have tasted over the past few years.. Today was my 3rd visit.Better to reserve a table before you come as there may be a long queue.. staff is nice and friendly but in a crowded place, dun expect the staff to always be available. relax and wait your turn. I will be back.. real soon!!
4
I do not believe there's affordable price dim sum in ion orchard until I tried this. I'm not saying it because the price is dead cheap, no, it's not. It's affordable because I think it's worth the value, for the settings of the restaurant, the service and of course the quality of the food.Dumplings skin is thin enough, nicer than a lot of dim sum restaurants. And the must order will be "liu sha bao" (custard dumplings) and "wu kok" (deep fried yam with char siew fillings). The custard dumplings are very fragrant, and you really want that to be in your mouth as long as possible, because the after taste was great too! The deep fried prawn rolls however is forgettable.Do make reservation if you're going on weekends. I've tried going for lunch on Saturday without a reservation, and we were told there will be tables available after 3pm. So, make your reservation
4
This restaurant and imperial treasure is very good for dim sum, so can't comment on their dinner or prices thenFor lunch, we had the traditional favorites - carrot cake, xiaolongbao, shrimp dumpling, chicken feet. The carrot cake and chicken feet are consistently good. The xiaolongbao i feel are even better than dingtaifung's, with more soup in the dumpling. The skin of the shrimp dumpling is very thinA new item i discovered was the baked pork pastry that is similar to timhowan's and it was delicious. Another new item was the cold truffle noodles and it was very good too. They have a hot version which i'll try another time that i assume may come close to imperial treasure's truffle noodlesOverall, will certainly return for more dim sum, though a little pricey. They should be ranked higher her
4
We ordered 8 dishes including 1 appetizer. Satisfied with all except Broccoli with crab meat. Costs $36 but it is really just like any stir fry vege. Roasted peking duck is good, probably a must try. Shark's fin with stone is another dish which i will order if i go back as the broth is thick and tasty. Crab pincer with salted egg is love as it was deshell ! how convenien
5
I have been there with my family as my friend recommend this restaurant. The restaurant is on the 4th floor at ION shooping mall. It is well design and luxury. We booked the table before we went there. It is quite a long queue there. The price is a bit expensive but the taste is so good and worth to pay.We order many dishes. The best one is pecking duck. The waiter slice the duck skin showing us. It is very delicious. After that the duck meat had been cooked for us. It is also good taste. I am sure that I must return to this restaurant when I visited Singapore next time
2
Had a gathering of 10 people over dinner, and was impressed with the decor, service and views. However, the food left much to be desired, considering the sky-high prices being charged. The exotic dishes didn't give me any heavenly feeling nor leave me wanting more.For example, their wagyu beef stir fry tasted no different from the usual beef stir fry, with the meat being cooked to the point where it wasn't really tender.Left the restaurant thinking there were much better places for me to spend my money
4
Unable to get a reservation in Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck (Paragon), I chose Taste Paradise instead. This was my second dinner at this restaurant and it did not fail to impress me with good service and great food. The interiors were grand and reminded me of an imperial palace, with huge Chinese paintings. The waiters were attentive and provided excellent service. The dishes were served promptly and were definitely good. I would definitely come back again to this restaurant
4
Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere at this restaurant. Certainly a step up from a casual meal out!! Excellent service and absolutely beautiful food - but this comes at a price
2
So disappointed, me and my husband ordered executive dinner each 68$ before++,very small portions,the soup was disgusting... Expected much more from such type of restaurant.
3
It is hard to translate fine dining to typical chinese dishes. Taste Paradise does a decent attempt but if you compare it to Hong Kong then definitely it pales in comparison. We celebrated father's day here and the place was packed as usual. Service was ok but this one waiter was really bad, he gave you a blank look when requesting for service and brought us the wrong type of tea as well. The food was good though. The Beijing duck and the subsequent fried rice with the remnant meat was excellent and the foie gras bacon salad was excellent too. Char Siew was average as it was served heavily with the sauce. I think if the prices wasn't so exorbitant, this reviewer would have rated it higher. For me, go only on special occasions
5
Good:-The food is excellent!-ANZ & OCBC credit cards have discount.-One of the premium restaurants from Paradise Group.Bad:-Expensive carpark.-Even with a reservation, you have to wait to be seated.-During peak hour, the staff are too busy.-The Chinese Tea is served in this Tea Pot which is so small size, after pouring out the tea for 4 pax, I have to get the staff to refill it, its a hassle
4
The food was quite good overall. The ambient is certainly set up to be fine dining style, right from the time you come in. The food is pretty interesting and good, I had a dinner service there. The managers will surely will push off the menu items, so remember to ask for the price as well. The restaurant has a section that has huge windows that faces the streets, so it does bring up the mood of the meal if you are there, at night
1
My family wanted a Chinese fine dining. Booked a room at Taste Paradise Orchard Ion. I was informed that there is a minimum charge of $100 per pax before ++. We were ok with it. This manager from Malaysia started pushing us off the menu items, which are typically much more expensive. Despite us saying that we are not keen, she would come in and repeatedly harass us to try the off menu item. VERY HARD SELL! We instructed her that if we are still short of the $100 per pax minimum, let us know and we would order desserts and others. When the bill came, the fish items were marked up ridiculously high as compared to the price stated on the menu so as to meet the $100 per pax minimum. Night time robbery. For the price, food is below average. And the service managers - complete lack of sophistication and simply NO CLASS for the amount of price we paying. They were like hawker centre aunties.Tung Lok much better
5
Taste Paradise serves one of the best dim sum in Singapore. Must try: custard buns, char siew pastry, siew mai, har gao. Signature dish is carrot cake. They also serve very good soup. Chicken feet in abalone sauce. Service is good, staff are friendly. Do make reservation if you do not want to be turn away
4
Decided to have dinner here after the imperial treasure steamboat next door was booked solidService was pleasant and smiles all round, and you can sense they are trying to be efficient. We had the carrot cake, roast pork, cod and vermicelli dishes. All were good, though not were spectacular, unlike some dishes you can finf at imperial treasure. They do try to appear high end , with an amuse bouche of duck, rather than the usual nuts or pickles. And the crockery looks expensiveOverall it was a good experience. I only read some of the unfortunate experiences by others here after the dinner and am glad mine was a happy on
2
I've heard and read rave reviews and was really disappointed. The service is surly. They actually turned me away 3 times for stupid reasons (said I arrived too late twice when I was there well before the closing time each time), and the third time they said I was too early and they were getting ready to open. When I insisted, I got three sighs and 2 eye rollings. Both things I ordered were unavailable on the menu. The food I was given was mediocre at best. I would not recommend this restaurant
2
The food was ok, their eggplant dish, hot and sour soup were good, the rest of the dishes we tried, did not really leave an impression. The ambience is good however we were disappointed with the service. First of all we waited for ordering for quite awhile and have to remind a few times to tell them we need to order. While we were eating, their staff was trying to fill up my tea and the tea actually dripped into my bowl of soup. He apologised and he gave out some giggling, did not feel apologetic at all. they did not offer to change my soup but just walk away. The second time they did it again to our dish!! We were very much disappointed with their service and the pricing to be honest is steep. If I have to pay that price and I'm not getting the service, I will not be going back again regardless how good the food is.
1
Please God avoid the crab and shellfish, I have had two days bad food poisoning so far. Called them and they were not even interested to inform the chef.
5
We came to celebrate a birthday and I was impressed with the decor with ancient chinese ruler portraits on the walls. try the rich soups as well as the duck and lamb
4
We had a few arrangements on co. lunch/dinner in this restaurant, and has no complaint but joy.
Food is delicious and service is good. (My favorite: Crackling Pork Belly & steamed custard bun)
4
taste paradise has some great desserts, be sure to try the aloe vera one!
service is pretty good and staff are courteous. good chinese food and this place is popular on weekends so it's probably better to make a reservation first!
3
Situated on the upper levels of ION, the Yum Cha at Taste Paradise is considered quite expensive. However, the taste of the food does not match the price that you pay. The staff often seems appears disoriented and the service is nowhere near good. During my last visit, one of the staff apparently attempted to pour tea but her sight was elsewhere and started overflowing my cup. She hissed 'sorry' then walked off without even attempting to clean up the mess she made. The other visits that I made, as I have made reservations and arrived on time but my guests weren't; they were rushing me to order and constantly asking me whether I am ready to order. It was quite a terrible experience
3
Excellent Dim Sum. Of course it is quite pricey as it is in Orchard Ion shopping mall. You could have similar food in Chinatown for less than half the price. The wait staff tried but they were all rather clueless with extremely bad English. The Dim Sum came quickly, but the noodle dish (off the menu) took AGES to come. Overall, there is other dim sum in Singapore that is a better experience, however...the taste was quite good
3
Celebrated my birthday here with my missus minus the awful experience with the reservation I would have had a lovely birthday lunch. Dim sum was lovely and they have quite a few variations of traditional dim sum dishes which you would expect with the prices but the awful experience of arriving before proposed reservation and not going in until 20-25minutes later was terrible.Note to management: Dont take reservations if you can't make it happen... its worse thing for your reputation... take a note out of Imperial Chinas book :
1
Yes you read right - rats. Because that's what we found in our private room. It was a chinese new year lunch and I was entertiaining a group of associates. Lunch was at 12pm and we were there at 11:45am making seating arrangements when we notice a huge rat casually (is there any other way?) run into our private room and into a gap in the wall. We were shocked for words. We screamed at the waitstaff who casually attributed the uninvited guest's presence due the car park a story above. No apologies made, no sense of urgency. My guests had started to arrive. We demanded a change of room but the other rooms were too small. The manager got a staff to stand by the wall in case there was another appearence. Needless to say, me and my colleagues were tense throughout lunch. And our worst nightmare came to fruition when the rat made another appearence. How none of our guests looked down was a miracle. At the end of lunch, we rushed everyone out of the room. The restaurant staff never apologised nor did they offer to give us a discount. In short, they did not care. They called the building management who came down and they said, "we will check" (what else could they say?). It was a shocking and bitter experience for any restaurant. I will never come back
4
Although the food is abit pricey, the grand decor, atmosphere and excellent food make up for it. Personal favourites are the flavorful dumplings (especially the foie gras with pork dumplings) , x.o. carrot cake, Siew Mai, and custard buns. The custard bun is so good as the filling literally burst when you take a bite. Great place for special occasions or when you have overseas guests
4
Taste paradise is popular, with a huge mass of people waiting for tables at weekends. Don't be put off however, as our 30min wait was in reality only 10mins max.The setting is not what you'd expect inside, and it certainly doesn't feel like you're in a shopping centre, which is a plus-point. Service is efficient and friendly, and there's a great menu with usual dim sum favorites, as well as interesting specialities.Not the cheapest place for dim sum in Singapore, but equally it's good value considering the location and the food is good
3
We ordered sharkfin, beef with foei gras, lobster, and vegetable. Everything was great till the bill came. They charged too expensive for one lobster.
2
Another one of those modern 'fusion' Chinese restaurants with miniscule servings and inflated prices.
4
get to taste the foi gras and lots of shark's fin(big pieces) at a very reasonable price..

Horrible experience at Taste Paradise OrchardLast Wednesday (October 19) I arranged for a company dinner at Taste of Paradise. We were a group of 20 consisting of visitors from the US, UK, multiple countries and locals. We ordered an elaborate set meal with wine to along with our meal.Horrible part is this – one guy got served a cockroach, bug in his meal!!! Never thought this could happen at such an expensive restaurant. Even more appalling part was how service manager and crew dealt with it.I’m just amazed at how restaurant owners and management have trained the service people very bad way – which is how not to handle.Will not be going to the place again
3
Went for lunch with my wife and two family members. The food and service were great. As it was our first time, the waitress was helpful in helping us with the menu. The oven-baked cod fish was exceptionally tasty. The Peking duck is only mediocre. Overall, everything was satisfying, except that the meal is expensive. It works out to about $70 per person and we did not order any beverages
4
We had dinner for 10 pax at the Taste Paradise @ ION.Ambience : Typical deluxe Chinese restuarant. Staff were attentive but more conversant in Cantonese and Chinese than English. Nevertheless they were helpful and responded fast and correctly to all our requests.We ordered a few of their specialties;1) The signature suckling pig was good, but not extraordinary. The leftover meat was stirfried with salt and pepper and great for snacking.2) The prawns with salted egg paste was sticky but prawns were fresh and firm. This version, though not our favourite, was far better than the version we had at Imperial Treausres @ MBS, which turned into a gooey affair.3) The highlight was the vermicelli with scallops. The vermicelli must have been stir-fried before being braised. The vermicelli has managed to retain its stir-fried smokiness and its firm texture, rather than some normal braised vermicelli which tended to be over-cooked and too soggy soft. This vermicelli was so good, it left all of us raving. 4) The beef done stirfried in Cantonese style was a whee bit too tenderised for our liking. A bit too sweet too as it overwhelmed any remnants of the stir-fried aroma.5) The fried rice with ebiko was a refreshing combination of fried rice, well done, dry and aromatic and yet, the ibiko adds a crunch to every bite. Good and creative use of textures and flavours.6) Their version of a single portion ramen with garoupa was well-done. Noodles were firm, springy and full of taste. Certainly a clever arrangement.7) The soups were very good. Robust, full of taste of Oriental herbs and goodness and yet not oily. We felt invigorated almost immediately.8) We all tried all their various deserts but the better one was the fried durian only for durian lovers. The rest of the deserts were more show than substance though.Overall a lovely dinner. Not fantastic, not over the moon but still a good run of the money for the Crystal Jade chain

We went there yesterday for my wifes birthday. Food was good, staff were charming and friendly. The bill had a few surprises including the cost of the tea!! But it was at ION so we should have been expecting to be slugged.The ambience is marvelous. They could do a bit better on the value proposition but I was impressed and would go again

On business in Singapore I decided to go to a restaurant in Chinatown. I looked up the location and decided to give taste paradise a go. When I arrived (29th Sept 2010) at 49 mosque street the restaurant is no longer there. There is just a building site in its place. Maybe rennovating but I think gone for good

While I did notice that their regular menu price seemed to be a bit pricey even by Singapore standards, I went in for the dim sum menu on a Saturday afternoon. Some of the best dim sum I tried in Singapore, with a good wait staff and every dim sum menu cooked upon ordering and delivered to my table hot right from the steamers. Try everything, but especially the egg tarts! The custard bun was a bit too sweet and rich for my preference, however

a "modern" way of presenting traditional cantonese cuisines. XO carrot cake over rated..abalone noodles was good, Sharks fin suppose to be the main attraction with old hen broth.. chef recommended eat without vinegar but i think some vinegar should be added or have some sauvignon blanc will do nicely. Free velet parking! May upgrade to favorite if next visit is good

Food is good but not worth as much as the exhorbidant prices amd tiny portions.

Their sharkfin rocks!!! But prices are quite high for a restaurant in that area. Plus most dishes are priced for per pax.

Mid/upmarket Chinese Restaurant-A very enjoyable dining experience. Service staff are obliging with the kitchen always willing to whip out something different for special occasions or difficult palates. Personal highlight is always the Double-boiled superior sharkâ€™s fin with abalone and dried conpoy in traditional Beijing broth accompanied with bacon onion roll, served in a robust stone bowl. At approx S$50per serving, it is a pretty penny but worth every cent, IMHO

Chinese contemporary fusion cuisine without the cheesiness and the trying-too-hard of some other establishments. Tastes freshly Chinese while hinting at Chinese _influences_ in South East Asian cooking. Go in a group, order some dishes and let them decide on the order of arrival - they'll tailor it according to what you ordered. Last word : the desserts are courtly in presentation :) as they should be, seeing how ice was hard to obtain
