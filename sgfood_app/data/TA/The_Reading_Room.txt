Nice cafe with excellent service. I had a couple of glasses of wine and read, while my friend got some work done. We ordered bruchetta, wine and coffee. All were excellent. Would definitely recommend.
4
The ambience was nice and quiet. I like the fact that book shelves are used to create private space for customers. The food was all right and service was good.
4
Decent spot to hide for a while. Books are a little dated and the menu options are, to say the least, satisfying - and there's a friendly vibe about the place.

Service was good. However, the iced matcha latte that I ordered was subpar. The place is pretty quiet and good for relaxing.

This place is a trap! We were on lunch break from a course just a few metres away when we stumbled upon this place around 12noon. Only drinks menu were placed outside so we went in to see what they had to offer for lunch. It was a quiet place with only one other lady sitting inside so we decided to stay and order even if the prices were quite steep and some items on the menu were not available. We specifically asked how Long it would take for the bolognese to be served because we had to back by 1pm. The waitress replied 5 mins but it took forever for our food to arrive. We were asked if we wanted cold or warm water, we asked for 3 cups of warm water which never came. More people started coming in the staff were kind of avoiding our table for us not to be able to follow up our orders. Well it felt that way. The bolognese were served and another table was served but the buttermilk pancakes arrived 5 minutes before one o clock and they were so small served with thinly sliced strawberries. Hand cut fries were too salty, we wanted to ask for some catsup or Chili sauce but the staff were very good at ignoring outlet table. Such a disappointment! If only I could give 0 stars. Will never go back to this place. Spent $77 including service charge when the service is terrible! Definitely not worth it! If you are reading this, please step up on your service

I ordered the eggs benedict and the hollandaise sauce came all congealed and fake-looking, while my friend’s lobster pasta in white wine was all dry and tasted like instant noodles/MSG. I love the decor and ambience of this place, and it was relatively quiet for the morning so very conducive to lazing around and reading, but I really cannot recommend the food for these prices ($20-30)!
4
The place is a cosy one and I love all these artifacts that mix together so well.Food is fine, although I was kind of surprised/disappointed to get a burger served on a plastic (?!) tray.Otherwise, please do something with your wine list. House wine should be labelled basement wine :-

This bar is located in a quiet street on the edge of Chinatown and is one of the few places in the area open at lunch that accepts credit cards (hence its popularity).The decor follows the reading room theme, with wall to ceiling bookshelves that also act as dividers. This is pretty much the end of the cool factor. The seating is a mix bag of mismatched chairs and armchairs paired with tiny tables, some of them very uncomfortable for eating. The A/C was blowing cold air on my neck as I was having brunch. The food is unfortunately one of the victims of this establishment: after 30 minutes I finally got a small plate with a couple of eggs over ham and salad. Nothing to write home about. My 6 dollars tea was well done with by the time I got my order. Total with tax and service was close to $30: a bit steep for a slow service (the place was not busy at all) and a small breakfast. They also serve a bigger plate called "the works", which with drinks, tax and service would probably add up to $50+I won't return anytime soon.

Hubby and I were totally in love with this place. The ambience is perfect to grab a book and some tea/coffee. The food was good. My salmon was well done. The Crab croquettes were to die for. Just felt that the music was too loud for such ambience. The lights can be slightly brighter. Overall, great experience and worth the money.

We didn't know that their Sunday brunch started at 11am. The Chope app had indicated Reading Room would be open from 9am sooo we booked it fot 930am. We rocked up and the crew were just opening up the place. A very nice service staff explained that they only open at 11 on Sundays but since they got our booking, they asked the cook to come it a lil earlier to sort us. Gotta say that deserves major points for initiative and service commitment.The place is like someone's study, filled with books and old collectibles complete with that musky carpet smell if you like that sort of thing. I do and I wish I had a study like this growing up. Of course, the stacks and stacks of books were lost on my kids. Pity.Food was standard. The usual big breakfast and sandwiches that you can lump into one indistinguishable hipster-cafe mess. The portabello omelette was probably the most interesting. Even then, the pricing is a lil high. BTW, only cash and Nets accepted so come prepared.Overall, I'd say I'd speak fondly of Reading Room for its staff's commitment to service and the books galore (if you're a bookworm like me) than the food. Then again, when you have a good book in your hand, that's already food for thought :
4
Quiet and chill place for a good read. Friendly staff. Food was ok. A few mosquitoes bit my friends and I.
5
Lovely ambience for the evening, quiet and suitable for readers. Menu was ok; main attraction was the setting and environment.
5
The cafe had a really good ambience! The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. The food was also amazing and worth the money :)
5
Absolutely love this place! The deco of the exterior and interior is stunning. A nice place to chill with friends or by yourself. Their portobello fries is a must have!
5
Love the ambiance and the food so much.
Quiet, cosy, lovely!
Love one of their dishes extremely much! It's called the burrata cheese platter. Do try it if you're there x

I would have given this restaurant 5 stars, but the only things that I did not like were:1. toilets - on the edge of being dirty and a little too quirky for me2. cash only - the prices here for a main are expensive. I did not have a lot of Singaporean dollars on me, and spent half of what I had on this meal. If this was some greasy spoon, I could understand that. But, when a a main, a cider and a dessert cost $55 ish Singaporean dollars, I think it is unreasonable to expect people to have that much cash in our plastic era.3. difficult to find - at one point, I felt like I was on the Amazing Race trying to find some obscure restaurant. It took us probably 30 minutes, which in the heat of Singapore is not a fun experience. What I liked:1. TRR burger - this was outstanding. The size is not impressive, but it is a flavour bomb that was cooked perfectly and every condiment and accompaniment (like the bacon) just added another layer of flavour. The fries looked a bit unconventional at first, but were served in a metal frying basket. I thought they were delicious!2. Coffee - I had some sort of specialty coffee with himalayan salt. It was served with a little heart drawn into the foam and was delish.3. service - was fairly good. Only a few servers, but it was generally easy to get someone's attention.4. Decor - quirky and quaint - some more standard tables other coffee tables with arm chairs. You can take a book from behind the book cases and read it.Overall, it was a good experience. They really need to advertise or at least tell you up front that it is cash only
2
What I liked1. Really comfortable space with nice decor with lots of books. Easy to sit and enjoy time talking.2. Great cider3. Small but nice selection of tea.4. Friendly staff - helped me connect to the wifi What I didn't like1. The nearest subway is Outram park and it would have been a short walk if we didn't continuously get lost. We phoned the restaurant and asked several people- finally the lady in the 7/11 pointed us in the right direction. Problem is there is a large hotel in back of the subway and you need to walk through their driveway to see the street sign2. I personally didn't like the chicken burger. The seasoning seem overwhelming. However the fries were good. Meanwhile my friend thought her hamburger was the best she's ever tasted.3. The path to the washroom is close to the kitchen. This is pretty hot and humid. My clothes ended up scented with food.4. I would have liked to know ahead of time that they only accept cash and no credit cards. While, the prices are reasonable, people generally walk around with limited cash
5
Loved the ambience here – a quaint and cosy place perfect for a nice conversation over a delicious meal or for settling into an armchair with one of the many books available for in-house reading. It helped greatly that the food was wonderful too – We ordered the burrata as a starter and had traditional bolognese and lobster tagliatelle in creamy tarragon thereafter, and enjoyed everything! Will definitely return
3
I'm starting to become a regular here, purely for the ambiance. The place is cosy, the choice of music played is excellent and the seating is very comfortable. It's a great place to sit back and read (for which you'll find plenty of variety), work or chit chat. The drinks are pretty good too. The food could do with some improvement, the steak I had was quite uninspiring, given the price being charged and the spicy wings were also just about average. The pricing is reasonable. I'll be back, quite often at that
4
Went on a weekday lunch and crowd was ok. Had the fish and chips and smashed burger. The fries was very well battered and keep you wanting for more. Only downside was the aircon really need some maintenance, took quite some time before i felt the chill in the roo
5
I enjoyed a quick burger at the reading room after a business meeting. The cafe is relaxed, has a decent wine list, and would probably be a quite reading nook in the evening.
5
Suitable to go with a bunch of friends to chill out, would be great if there are more varieties of cakes and dessert!
3
Ordered avocado with eggs. Poached egg was overcooked and had an overly sour taste due to too much vinegar used during poaching. Smashed banana pancake also did not live up to expectation.
5
Suitable for chatting Lightly and Atmosphere is super nice, service excellent , food taste quite especial , overall are good
5
At first glance, the Reading Room reminded us of the library with countless stalls of books and cozy velvet sofas. It is a rather small cafe with two spaces separated from each other with a window. The coffee was served in a vintage cup, which added uniqueness to this whole experience, and the smoothie was also amazing. We needed to find a venue where we could work, yet still enjoyed a nice cup of coffee, so this place is definitely the quietest place we have been so far in Singapore
4
it does come with shelves and shelves of books. what's noteworthy is they even have a shelf of children's book, which makes my daughter very happy and made our stay there not long enough. she noted down the page number and said she wants to go back again!foodwise, there is room for improvement: (1) it'd be nice if the staff could inform me that the pasta that i ordered is spicy, especially knowing that a kid will be sharing that order. who would think "seafood marina pasta" is spicy?! (2) the cake selection for the high tea set is limited and the cakes don't look like they are freshly delivered that day
4
Whenever I'm around the area and would like to catch up with friends over a few drinks, the reading room is definitely my choice. Quiet and cosy cafe/bar, with lots of books for you to read if you like. But what I love most is the conducive space for you to chat with your friends without raising your voice.
1
Firstly, the restaurant was supposed to open at 11am. However, even at 1110am, the Closed sign was still there and we had to ask the waitress if the café was open. We were seated and we promptly proceeded with our order. After waiting around 45mins. Only our drinks had been served despite the fact that we were THE ONLY CUSTOMERS in the entire morning. We left in a rage and went to another café 10 steps away, that was already seated at full capacity. Yet they managed to serve our food in 10 mins.Forget about going to this café. I'm never going back again even if they paid me. Absolute rubbish
5
I have been in Singapore for 3 days and I discovered this little place on the second day. I am staying round the corner in the Dorsett hotel but this is more my scene.Jagermeister... yes (not at Dorsett)Jameson... yes (not at Dorsett)Friendly bar staff... yes (not at Dorsett, they don't have a bar!)Free wifi... yes (Dorsett too but you have to log in every 24 hours, here you stay connected)Credit cards... yesDid I mention the Jagermeister? If it was in the deep freeze this place would be home from home

We visited The Reading Room for my husband's friend. We have been wanting to visit this cafe for a while, the ambience was good (although it is smaller than the images), great selection of books and decent coffee. However the service was pathetic on the weekend. They took 25 mins to bring our drinks, and 25 mins to bring pancakes, 25 mins for my friends sandwich. Then 15 mins later I got my sandwich. But they forgot my husband sandhwich, and 10 mins later the staff returns to say "we don't have if anymore". So we were pissed off but willing to get something else. but nothing else was available (it was all sold out). I do become a little suspicious when the menu is too extensive because quality lacks. So we ordered safe options. Advice: go on week day, stick to coffee only.
4
This is a place to chill and relax for the weekend , escape from the busy urban city. Here you can enjoy a glass of wine while listening to beautiful music
5
The Reading Room is stocked with four large shelves of great books that filled the walls Of an old shophouse. With a cozy ambience and great food, it is a must visit haven if you want a place of retreat to recharge.
5
Nice place lined with bookshelves and nostalgia. Friendly helpful hosts and a cool place for a drink.
4
Overall experience was good however the service a little slow. Good ambience and friendly staff, thanks
5
I was just walking around somewhere in outram park. I ordered pasta alfunghi and it was very delicious. Very nice ambience. The staff were very attentive and friendly.
3
Went on saturday afternoon with my girlfriend. The environment was okay, the food was okay~ But I would say that the waitress can be a little blur? They served us hot latte when we ordered ice latte. Ask for another credit card thinking that we are splitting bills when we didn't say anything about it. So if you are someone who doesn't accept "mistakes" as such, you might want to reconsider eating here
5
The place is pretty smaller than I expect but really awesome. I went there for dinner with my friends and it is a very nice place to chill. Music is great. The staff even give their recommendations for first time customer like us. Food is really delicious but a little bit pricey.
3
The last time we visited, myself and my wife were both disappointed with the food. We went back as we really liked the vibe of the place and would recommend for a tea/coffee and HH until 8pm. Nice chilled atmosphere with friendly staff!However, we ordered two burgers and they mixed up the order - this happens. It took 30 mins for them to arrive and the place was quiet when we arrived so with an apology they gave us the food. We told them this was wrong and they apologised and said they would "urgently" get our correct 2nd dish. After an extra 35 mins we gave up. This is not an exaggeration. Over 70 mins had passed from when we ordered to when I paid the bill and the 2nd burger hadn't arrived. I'm not sure this has happened to me anywhere else before. The first burger tasted good but the chips were luke warm. While the staff were friendly, they were nowhere to be seen to explain the delay for either order and didn't as much as offer a discount or free drink for their extremely poor service. If we go back here, it won't be for food. Such a disappointment
4
This is a very cosy cafe that offers a great place to chill with friends and family. It isn't a very big cafe though so can't imagine what the place is like during peak hours; was there at 9pm-ish and the place was rather quiet. It serves good variety of food and drinks. Prices are mid range. There are not a lot of street car parking lot outside the shop so one may have to park away and walk to the cafe.Overall, it is a good place to hang out
4
Such exquisite place and delicious food. I had a fantastic time here at unassuming bar in Singapore. The drinks were good, place is cosy, the music is good, prices are reasonably priced and service was top notch. Aside from the food the atmosphere was great and the service was very good as well. I had two servers looking after me and both were attentive and friendl
5
What a great ambiance & so relaxing. Staffs are friendly & hospitable to the guests. Highly recommended & just nearby Outram mrt. Our friends sure to visit again this place.
4
On a quiet street in Singapore, find coffee, teas, cakes, pasta, book shelves ceiling-high, with background music of torch songs. Wi-fi, small tables, comfortable chairs and nobody bothers you. Good place to read, write, or talk.
4
A glass of wine, a comfortable armchair to relax in, everything you need at the end of a busy day in Singapore
4
I like the ambience and deco in the bar. A very cozy place. You can read the books. The concept is cool.
5
yummy blueberry cheesecake and apple crumble to accomopany my gryphon tea and coffees during our midday escape from work!!
3
The place has nice ambience and is good if just for coffee and cake as the food esp the soup is too salty and the staff is not very attentive
4
The decor and atmosphere here is really nice. With all the books and music, you can enjoy a relaxing night with friends. We ordered 4 main courses, 4 drinks and 1 truffle fries. Fries and Very Berry smoothie are quite nice, but main course is only so so. The martini grilled port is just like stir fried port from normal Asian restaurants, which is a bit disappointed. Average spent for above is $40/pa
4
'The Reading Room' Cafe and Bar near Outram Park in Singapore as the name suggests is stocked up with rows and shelves of Books stacked up against bright red walls. We stopped by over a cup of coffee, snacks and a fresh Berry drink. It was interesting to sip cofffee here , munching on snacks, listening to music, sitting cozily in heritage furniture sofas while turning pages of famous author's novel, glancing through magazines .... quiet and cozy !The setting of this cafe amidst old colonial styled heritage buildings all polished up in bright colours was indeed intriguing. We meandered through the by lanes near Outram Park MRT and sought out this cozy cafe.... sure enough , we were not disappointed.Its Much like a library , The only Difference is you can use this as a Meeting place with a small bunch of friends and family over Lunch, Tea, Coffee , Dinner and of course soothing Music. Bar is well stocked up and attracts a good crowd later in the evening. Nice place to visit once, while in Singapore
1
I visited the Reading Room with friends for Sunday brunch, the place was empty however the staff left us waiting for more that 20 minutes before they approached us to take the order! A lot of things listed in the menu were missing therefore we decided to leave the place and run back to our favorite brunch place The Lokal just next door
4
The Reading Room has always been my preferred place for a quick cuppa/drink with my friends.I like the mushroom dishes over here (Sauteed/deep fried), which is easily washed down with a pint of beer.The owner is very friendly and I've caught him a few times at the cafe where he's always ready for a good chat with a grin :
5
This was a lovely place with good food, really pretty decor and lots of good books! surely coming back again!
4
Love the atmosphere and how the place was decorated. Good music playlist. Nice lobster fresh pasta and affordable draft beers. Great place for a date or a small group gathering
5
It's a cool library. Pick your spot, order some food (western style mostly) and pick up a book. It has a very relaxed atmosphere, great music- reminding me of a NY cafe. We had chicken schnitzel and mozz/tomato sandwiches - both great. Average price for lunch $12-15 for lunch without alcohol or cake.
3
A petit library kind of cafe! You can relax all you want if you order food and coffee. If you are here for just coffee then you would be shown a high table, which translates to "be quick to leave once you are done with coffee" we opted to order food even though we had just had our lunch just so that we can make use of the comfortable seating. I can understand such a ruling if the place is fully occupied but the afternoon we went there, the place wasn't half occupied and yet we were made to order food! The food was so-so but the coffee was good. So good that we ended up having two coffees each. If not for the "order food for good seating" rule we would have enjoyed this place totally. Still a pleasant place if you choose to ignore the silliness. Cheers
5
While staying in Singapore for a week, we visited a lot of good restaurants and cafés. The Reading Room stands out the most. The food, the service, and the ambiance was all on point. My family and I enjoyed our western-style meals as we discussed the various books and objects around us. Very cosy and comfortable place to eat
4
We went for dinner on a Tuesday night after we arrived in Singapore that day. It was close to where we were staying and looked to have an interesting theme (dining in a room of books). The menu was a range of different western style dishes.We found the service was good and the food tasty and well cooked. The surrounding books and objects such as old telephones helped the dinner conversation. The only negative was that some of the meals shown on the menu weren't available when we went to order but we found good substitutes
5
The plan was to drop in for a quick lunch but i ended up staying for coffee, cakes and a glass of wine.I had the best tasting bolognese in singapore so far, with iced tea and a slice of nice homemade earl grey tea cake and washed it down with a really really good coffew. You guys will see me soon if im ever back in the area.
5
planning which cafe to head to over the weekend is like planning for a wedding.. and a bad move will ruin your entire day. luckily my bestie made a great choice when we visited the reading room over the long weekend. it was packed but as expected. we were smart to make a reservation ahead of time. the food was excellent. i had the basics and bestie their burger. both delicious. loved the book cafe concept and ambiance created around the ceiling high shelves of books. service was friendly and overall glad we made the trip to outram to check out this wonderful cafe
1
We went to this café for a Sunday brunch and we would never recommend it. We needed to remind them our order after 40 min waiting (and they didn't seem embarrassed at all). They finally served us. We waited more than 1 hour just for the entry (simple bruschettas with tomatoes) and more for the main dishes, which came after another 20 min waiting. First service was taken back since apparently it was supposed to be for an other customer. Then the 2nd try: my main dish was wrong... But she asked me if I could take it, I refused (it was Benedicte eggs with truffles which I really don't like).We waited again, but my order never arrived so we decided to leave. We paid just what we took (and I think it was nice from us to pay). They really didn't seem to bother, they didn't care. Maybe we came on a bad day (lack of staff or maybe another issue, you know it can happen) but their behavior was - according to me - unacceptable: completely unprofessional and almost rude.Regarding the food: it wasn't bad (I mean: from what we could have..), but nothing exceptional and a little bit pricy. It's a shame because the place is small, quiet and nice.I hope you will have a better experience if you go to The Reading Room. But for sure we will never go back again!

How do you love to spend your weekend afternoons? Some love to explore new places, catch a movie maybe? while some just want to nua at home and do nothing. Well If you are one that loves exploring quint new places, the Reading Room Cafe located at Bukit Pasoh Road should be the best place for you to visit 
4
Yes, you can read a book over a pint here. Lovely staff, good service, a cosy ambience, plenty of books and near another (Chinese) bookstore just a few units down the street, what's there not to like?
5
I visited here on several different occasions. This is one of my favorite cafes to chill and at the same time discuss about work. The setting is filled with ceiling height bookshelves, some old-fashioned and vintage decor adds a little rustic feel to the whole ambience. It's not rowdy, the staff are all very friendly and the coffee is awesome. I totally love love love their Affogato and Himalayan salt coffee.This small cafe is just too good to chill the afternoon or unwind after a busy day at work. It's peacefully tucked away from the busy city, at Bukit Pasoh Rd which is easily access by Mrt at Outram Park Station. If you drive, there are some (limited) parallel parking along the road.
3
I came here to read, but they had horrible loud music playing. So I ended up ordering an overpriced tea and free loading the wifi.
2
Ambiance is great. Price not up to what you will be getting. Food badly need improvement esp the fish & chips and mozzarella tomato basil sandwich. The only thing worth paying is the service delivered by the friendly staff
4
Such a cosy dining environment. We came here for dinner and the first thing that caught our eyes were the shelves of books, of course. Great decor, food menu was basic but had enough choices- pastas, burgers, starters, desserts and happy hour drink prices! Soft jazzy music was played at the background. I can imagine in the day time this will be a quiet cafe.this is not a huge place with about 6 tables
3
Nice, vintage bar in a heritage neighborhood of Singapore. Located inside a shop house.Good place to go for a coffee or drink. I would not consider coming here for dinner since the setting really is that of a cafe/bar, not restaurant.2 things to improve:1) We visited in the evening after dinner and hot drinks were not available any more.2) Aircon was freezing cold
1
It was recommended....and i didnt understand why. Nothing special about it but damn black meat n just normal bread. Maybe should have ordered something else.
1
Good atmosphere but service is beyond terrible especially this so called Chef that continuously coming to the bar and drinking and flirting. When I approached him he was so rude. Is this the kind of staff u hire? Hired to drink and get drunk or work
4
Lovely place with some good books available for customers either to reed or buy.I had a breast chicken teriyaki with side salad and white wine, it was delicious.There are also some options for dessert specially for those who enjoy cheesecakes and pies.Music was good also and it is frequented by all kind of people, since families to friends, couples and lonely ones like myself
5
What a find!..... Get off the MRT at Outram Park turn right and you will find a small area of bars and restaurants. This is a quaint area off the tourist track. Here we sat outside in the lovely green potted area, relaxing with a bottle of wine. The staff are friendly with a decent all day happy hour (finishes at 8pm) also has a special promo each day.
3
Food was very normal. prices were decent but not suitable for more than 2 people. Music is so loud that it tends to drain out any conversation.
4
Cozy place to relax while sipping your favorite coffee and reading your favorite novel. Feels like your own little quite spot away from home.
5
Took the family for a weekend brunch at the reading room and was really surprised at the amazing food dished out
The basics and norwegian royale was delicious! Everything tasted so fresh from the eggs to the greens
Amazing, will be back!
5
We walked our way from the Outram Park MRT and it was a mere 5-7 mins walk. The place has a great ambience. We reached around 7:45 PM and stayed until 11 PM. Some of the food could be a little overpriced if you are a budget traveller or a student. We had some wine before 8 PM (happy hour) which cost $8 (house red/white wine). The place has a lot of books if you love reading. The best time for that however is during the day, as the place gets dimmer by evening. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Overall a great place to hang out with friends and relax
5
The Reading Room on Bukit Pasoh Road is one of those little places that you might mistake for a shady bar. However, you step inside and find that undiscovered corner of the city that welcomes you in with its warmth.The decor reminded me of old bookstores, where books are neatly piled and arranged from floor to ceiling, with the odd eclectic knick knack thrown in between. This place boasts of a huge collection of fiction, sometimes with multiple copies of the most popular titles. I visited in the late evening and the mood lighting and all those books actually got me looking around for a fireplace!!The food in this place is rather good, considering that cafes do not usually pay attention to the food and rely on coffees and teas. I tried three paninis here, The service is attentive and polite. Nina, my server, was very helpful and courteous with her suggestions. Also this place stays open till 11:30 pm, way past most of the other restaurants in the area. So if you missed your dinner and can't find a place to eat (like I did), you could come over here.The Reading Room is the perfect place to settle in with a good book, on a lazy afternoon or have a conversation with a group of friends. I for one will be visiting again
5
Stumbled upon this restaurant and was immediately charmed by its interior design of books and library theme ambience.Had their brunch menu's The Works and was greeted with a satisfying plate of bacon, eggs,French toasts...etc. It was amazing.My wife's Salmon Royale was unforgettable... Soft creamy scrambled eggs folded with Norwegian Smoked Salmon on top of crispy but custardy French toasts!! Heaven on a plate!! I found my favourite brunch menu!!!
4
I was introduced to this snug cafe by a friend. They have an interesting concept, it's a cafe by day and a bar by night. Their coffees and food are copacetic, but the ambience is great for some quality time for talks. The bookshelves are filled with different genres of books that are available for browsing. Overall, a trendy and quiet cafe with an exquisite interior
4
My order took forever to arrive, but it was worth the wait. Perfectly prepared, fresh, and delicious. Hate to say it, but I needed a break from Asian food in the middle of my trip.The restaurant gets much cooler as you walk back, if you're seeking respite from the heat
4
We were looking for a spot near China Town. The Reading Room popped up due to the great reviews. We rolled in about 8:30pm. In tow we had our identical twin 4 year old daughters and our 9 year old son, all starving. Got the kids some fries and a plain burger, was a smash hit with the kids. Wife and i went another way with two bottles of AUS white wine (yummy). This place is small and you should expect to eat from bar stool size tables, not usual restaurant tables. Servers were great and very accommodating. The food was good, but not spicy, so I was happy but not thrillled. Perfect for the kids though. I would come back again, sans children
4
Its a nice little cafe located along Bukit Pasoh Road. The concept is pretty simple, you get to eat in a little cafe with books, magazines and knick-knacks sitting on its tall book shelves, with comfortable cushioned and sofa seats beautifully arranged. A perfect place for a quite hideout from the maddening crowd and tropical heat. The food and drinks menu is pretty standard stuff. A variety of burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, coffee, tea etc. Overall, I loved the interior of the cafe and how they have created such a nice and relaxing place to chill out with a book, laptop or have a tête-à-tête with a friend over coffee
5
Nice little quiet quaint cafe tucked in the midst of the hustle and bustle of an urban city life. Food is great, deco is insta-worthy and ambience is cozy.
5
Im often on business and was pleasantly surprised by a charming cafe with a terrific brunch
Love the area stayed in a great hotel next door ill be surely back too bad had only a couple days to explore this side of Singapore
4
We bumped into this place for lunch, it is a petite lunch place, but tastefully decorated, food was option was ok, we have ordered panini, pasta and grilled pork, which are all quite nice, I would come back again if time permits. Very cozy place, good to just sit and hangout with friends or as couple
5
had their trÃ ditional bolognaise with homemade pappardelle. was delicious! i went back the next day and saw the chef hand making the pasta i knew it woukd be good so i ordered anoyher pasta the alfredo which was delicious again! 5 star for the great food and service
3
We dropped into this small cafe in Outram Park for a coffee after having lunch at a nearby restaurant. The interior is great: lots of books and interesting items on display. Service was a bit slow though and tea was a bit expensive at $7 for a cup. I ordered a cappuccino which took about 15 mins to arrive and was served in a small cup with about a third of milk froth. Nice place but service and coffee could certainly improve

The burger is awesome! Like we have eaten in a 5 star hotel, better than other burgers in sg! Me and my wife love it! Im definitely bringing friends in your place. I love the ambiance and staff. Very cozy. And staff are warm and friendly, Chona is exeptional! Keep it up! She made our day extra special. Cheers!

The meal was absolutely fantastic, great small little place for something different from regular Singaporean fare. If you would like a great burger and fish and chips and an amazing teriyaki chicken, with a coffee and great desert while you browse books (including books for kids) this is the place for you!!!

The most generous brunch for under $20 I got the works ! I am here everyday for the brunch (they must start it on weekdays to) I was recommended by some friends as a great place for coffee tea and WiFi to do work but their food is great too and definitely value for money That's all for my review I will catch u guys again when I'm back from my tri

The reading room is always the best place to spend a weekend for a short afternoon coffee breaks. The coffee here are good, my favorite is cappuccino :) the price is affordable. Besides, the atmosphere here is nice to hangout with friends away from hustle & bustle of city at Bukit PasohSometimes there are a regular spanish learning event happening in the studio on saturday 4pm, do drop by to say hola ! this is a review of a regular :P cheers ! a good cup of coffee brings good vibes

I'm sorry, but did I step into a different dimension from the other reviewer claiming that this place has the best coffee in the area? I saw that extremely misleading review, popped into this cafe hoping for a good cuppa joe, and what I got was a poorly foamed cup of latte with weak, acidic coffee. Boy was I peeved. If you're looking for real artisanal coffee, you're better off going to other cafes up and down the road- the Lokal, Roosevelt's, the Plain cafe..just to name a few. I won't be back here, that's for sure

dropped by for a quick coffee but now my go-to place for coffee meetings
soft music great service and even better coffee perfect for all my out of office meetings not to mention tasty sandwiches for a nibble
5
We found this restaurant by chance. it is just beside china town in street called Bukit Pasoh road it has a great atmosphere. good food good wine and beer. service was good very helpful staff. good selection of food well worth a visit
4
Stumbled over this little gem when exploring the back streets of Singapore. Quiet laid back atmosphere ideal for a sit down and relaxing thirst quencher. Went back a few days later for a light bite. Reasonable prices

What a beautiful cafe i stumbled into and not just for the looksThe food was amazing i had their weekend brunch well presented and delicious i can tell they use only premium ingredientsWill hihghly reccomend anyone to go when they are in the are

Stopped in with some friends on a Sunday afternoon--was in the mood for coffee and cake and ordered a latte and their apple crumb cake. Pretty tasty stuff and fun atmosphere with 1920's inspired music. Menu looked fun (was an old children's book cover with menu pages inside, cute!) and I'm really thinking about going back to have the TRR burger
5
This place is amazing!! A real hidden place outside the city rush. Situated in bukit pasoh road, the reading offers a cozy ambiance in this colonial district. The place is set up like a library, walls of books that made me feel so small were surrounding the tables.Ordered a brunch special (available on weekends) and was very very very very satisfied. The food was indeed worth for money and the coffee is excellent. A perfect roast in the perfect place.Service was way better than the local standard.Digging this place!!

This place has been on my "must be" list for a while. Based on the reviews, this places looks perfect for enjoying time alone. Most of famous coffee places in Singapore are too crowded to stay, I have been looking for a coffee place that has a nice coffee and I can read books sometime on weekends. It was 3-4 pm today when I arrived. Many seats were taken inside and outside but luckily I was able to get a cozy seat next to the window. (Solo advantage :p)What caught my eyes were a number of books arranged on the wall inside of coffee shop. I picked one noble and came back to my seat and ordered "simple lunch" and "very berry shake".Actually I was impressed by the lunch there, it came with a big sausage, a piece of soft bread, grilled tomato & mushroom, and marinated potato. Simple as said but enjoyable taste. I read one chapter of book that I picked while Im having my lunch, listening to music. More importantly, without any disturb. It was worth of my time and money.

The inspiring and irreverent Travelling Gourmet TM finds a quiet nook far from the…MADDING crowd where one can eat, drink and relax over a good book or two. This is The Reading Room which is a Cafe/Wine Bar and also a Library of sorts where you can select a book to read from the many that surround you or bring your own book. The mismatch of eclectic furniture and knick knacks gives this place an eccentric air and antique Analog telephones abound. It is a cosy place and in the inner sanctum which I call the VIP Lounge, there is even a dart board which I like to use for target practice Ha! Ha!Foodwise, this is no haute cuisine Michelin Star restaurant but I do appreciate the BLT Sandwich which is a hot toasted Ciabatta bread with melted Cheese and a Ham slice and Lettuce inside..and it is served with a small side salad of mixed Greens with Vinaigrette dressing. Suprisingly filling, it is tasty too and just the thing when you want a light lunch. I like to have it with a Cafe Latte or two. The Menus are converted from old Children’s Fairy Tales…most amusing. For dessert, Buttermilk Pancakes with Pear poached in Chianti Wine satisfies. On weekends, breakfast is also served like eggs done the way you like them...Another dish I like is the Spanish style Algondigas meat balls with a glass of robust red wine or two…surrounded by one of the things I love a lot…books. The Owner/Manager is Jacob, a Singaporean who is an amiable Eurasian Jew. His Grandfather emigrated to the USA from Poland to escape the Nazis

Although the name seems to be very obvious and it does have several shelves full of books, The Reading Room, with my take, is more as a place to hang out with one of your best friends.Sitting in a well-reserved old town near Outram Park MRT, its retro deco combines with continuous jazz songs to make a unique atmosphere. Food and coffee was nice with reasonable prices.However, the shop is not too spacious and you probably wouldn't have your own corner to enjoy a new book. Not suitable to go as big group of 5 or more either

We love staying in Bukit Pasoh at the Majestic a few doors down and this had opened since we had last visited. If you want a nice quiet cup of decent coffee and a chat with friends this is it. The furniture is eclectic - each setting matches but not between settings and this works perfectly. The staff are lovely and when we went back a couple of days later they recognised us. Also liked that they did take away as we had a late night one night and did not feel like room service. We ended up visiting three times during our stay.This reminds me of a traditional bookshop/café and is very well done
5
Hello guys I would like to share my extra ordinary experience having lunch @ the reading room..food was so insanely delicious especially minute steak and fish and chips..price where so reasonable..so guys what are you waiting for come on grab on try one now..
5
I went at The Reading Room last december 10 and it was the best cafe ive been so far in singapore and I must say the best coffee too.. nice staff and the food was perfect.. 👍
4
[+] I was in a large group and we took a long time to do everything (ordering.. hanging around.. even photo-taking) but the staff were very patient and accommodating. We weren't there for the books but I could tell it'd be a really cosy place if you're looking to have some quiet time. Cider is great![-] Food and drink are on the pricey side given the location and ambience - I would say strictly a treat for me. Food servings are really small except for the chicken schnitzel
4
was walking along bukit pasoh road & saw the name of the cafe. the exterior doesn't do the interior justice. as you peer in through the glass panes on the swing door, it reels you in & you're hit by the warmth & cosines of the place. the selection of furnitures & the way things are put together makes me want to stay & make what Saturday afternoons what they are supposed to be. made me feel completely at home. did not have a try at the menu today. Tea, books & the cosiness is enough to bring me back here, for now
4
The cafe design was very unusual to me as I have never been to a cafe like this before. I enjoyed the selection of books very much, however I felt the food servings we quite small for their or prices for a few of the dishes. Service was prompt and friendly
5
The service and atmosphere was top class but the food was overpriced, especially the minute steak with fries that I got. Otherwise a rather enjoyable experience and great for smallscaled birthday celebrations.
5
Not only because every Saturday afternoon we meet a group of us to practice Spanish language but also that this cafe has the European atmosphere that we miss in this part of the world. The Reading Room is unique in many ways: the decoration, the food (always innovating), the hospitality ...and the coffee
5
Whilst staying close by we came across this little place while walking around looking for somewhere to eat. We wandered in for breakfast on a Sunday morning with no trouble finding a seat. We chose one of the little two high seat tables close to the counter which were very cute, although the chairs were a bit of a challenge to get on being height deprived as I am! The whole place is full of books, floor to ceiling almost, which you can browse and read whilst there. The menu was extensive and varied with choices beyond the normal eggs and bacon and even came inside an old hard covered book, very cute. We chose freshly squeezed juice, a lovely herbal tea, pancakes and delightful French toast. Our meals were delivered quickly and were well presented and I must say it was one of the nicest breakfasts that I have had recently. Definitely worth a visit when staying in Singapore (close to Chinatown)
5
The Reading Room is our favorite cafe for weekly meet up and catching-up session. We love the long table with the horse deco on top. It is like going back to our second home for a relax and chilling afternoon after a week's of hardwork. The boss, Mr.Jacob is a friendly man and the staffs are very polite and patience in taking our order. They serve good spanish food and make very good coffee and also juices

Fancy eating and drinking in a reading room or a library? Have you ever sneak in food and drink into the library? You can experience it without any rule infringement at the Reading Room. The walls are lined of shelves filled with books of various genres. My friend just happened to pick out an interesting book right off the shelf. All the books are for sale. The cafe served the usual coffee fixes. My friend ordered the Himalayan Salt coffee (maybe we were ignorant, but we had never come across such coffee preparation), while I went for the trusted Flat White. The coffees were reasonably good. My friend did not rave much about the Himalayan salt coffee. We shared a fairly delicious red velvet cake. We really enjoyed the English ambience of this cafe.
5
Great food and people. So glad I hopped onto Tripadvisor and found it! Everything down to the music was perfect. Aussie/locally owned and operated.
5
The best choice for a day when you want to find a place to relax and enjoy your day with foods, drinks and listenning music.
4
This place was close to our hotel which is why we popped in and so glad we did - its small but very cosy and has a nice calm atmosphere. The walls are filled with books from top to bottom so its a gr8 place to stop for a coffee and quick bite to eat. We had a quick dinner here and the food was really good along with the friendly staff!
1
lovely place, but sadly discriminating service experienced. was hoping to move to a more comfy seating but told that it was for four and two of us has to incur a four person bill to get the seating. most incredible part was the one person who was on the seating previously, and reason given: he's a regular customer. it is really a lovely place, but the kind of approach you categorise your customers really turns me off
3
In summary: definitely worth a visit, it's very relaxed atmosphere feels chilled and welcoming. We'll probably go again but only for coffee and a cake next time. The Reading Room is small and quaint, lots of books (as you would expect from the name) lining the walls that you can buy, browse or borrow. To me it felt the perfect place for coffee and a cake sitting just at the edge of Chinatown away from the busy crowds. We went for dinner on a Saturday night, it was very quiet compared the busy bars and restaurants just round the corner. The food was good, the staff lovely but the service hit and miss. We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks and also asked for 2 glasses of tap water. We were told water wasn't available although they did bring one glass. The food arrived timely and was good although the seating arrangements are not great for eating anything other than a snack or finger food. The chairs are positioned around low coffee tables. We had to sit in an area for 4 people just to have enough room on the table for 2 plates.

This is the first review I am writing on Tripadvisor. This is largely due to the fantastic time I had at the Reading Room two nights ago, that I felt impulsed to write about this restaurant.My wife and I chanced upon the reading room while exploring the hip area of Bukit Pasoh. We were impressed by the display of beautiful fresh hanging flowers in full bloom and were keen to check the place out.We googled The Reading Room and the tripadvisor's reviews came out in the search. We read great reviews and decided to give the place a try.Once inside we were warmly greeted by the staff and was seated in a cosy corner surrounded by wall to wall shelves of books!!! The place was amazing and had a delightfully retro feel about it. Immediately we fell in love with the place and their very very friendly service.We ordered the Southern Fried Chicken, Minute Steak, for mains. Portuguese Chorizos and Portobello Fries for appetizers. And two pints of Kronenberg beer.The food were very delicious and We must admit, we were a bit skeptical about most Tripadvisors reviews, but this one is absolutely spot on!!!The whole meal came under $100 including beers, and I find that a very good value, considering what we get for that price!We will definitely be back, very soon
4
You can tell by the reviews that this is a place that divides opinion - it is NOT (and does not claim to be a gastronomic experience BUT. frenetic China Town, is five /10 mins from here- it is 2 mins from Outram Park MRT (NOT the Pearl's Centre side but behind the Dorsett Hotel (see separate review) - a small room lined with books (they lend and sell), gentle back ground music - Coffee and Cake, Spanish GARLIC Prawns (fresh) with bread ....... good quality wines (think their glasses are a tad small for the price) - customers a blend of local local and locals (work, live nearby) A couple from California felt really at home on Sunday lunchtime. The area apart form China Town, has some lovely old streets (READ the signs outside the buildings) and when you get hot have a rest here. Food served all day from 11.00am

I read about The Reading Room in a magazine at least a year back, but never found the time to visit till today. It is situated amongst a row of shophouses in Chinatown area, at 19 Bukit Pasoh Road, Singapore 089833 and the number to stay eonnected is 6220 9019.The outside is prettied up by plants and a distinctive maroon-and-white signboard, along with high bar tables and stools for those who prefer to have a glass of wine outdoors. The indoors is what really saps one's attention and leaves them awestruck - i never expected it to be this pretty. A combination of classic "library" combined with vintage charm, this comfortable cafe shall soon be my favorite spot to pop by.As the name implies, there are lots of books for reading or purchase, it is totally my kind of place - savouring a good book over a good meal or drink! The cosy, pretty ambience is enhanced further by sultry country / olden pop music, I spotted songs by Marilyn Monroe even!The TRR Burger came with bread that looked very freshly-baked, and it was almost crunchy at first bite. The beef patty was very delicious, well-marinated and succulent - the perfect juicy burger patty, save for tiny bits of hard fatty chunks. It was infused with the sapid flavor of cheese, enhancing the flavor. On top of that, the sweet crisps of lettuce, sour juiciness of tomato slices and crispy bacon elevated the texture and taste factors to very high notches on the sumptuous scale. I appreciated the quality recommendation.For more detailed infromation and photos, please feel free to visit:http://www.thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/lunch-at-reading-room.htm

The cafe is quiet and comfortable to stay in. However, the cafe can be more warmly-lit. Lunch is too bland, far below my expectation. Love the selection of books and the warm service provided by the lady today! A good place to quieten down and enjoy an amazing time of reading
5
I love this place. My first time here and upon entering.. books books books..Service is great too.. They were happy to let us hang out with awesome new York Times bestseller Irish author John connolly till late.1 star to make it a perfect 5 for the mere fact that they have a copy of R K NARAYAN's bookO M Gthe second time i went there a few days later, tried more of their food... the food was yum and the atmosphere/vibes that made it even better :)great place, great service, great vibes. I LOVE IT...did i mention LOTS OF BOOKS?
4
finally found a quiet place to enjoy good food and service. the staff suggest Tapas of the Day which is Albondigas. When the food came out and i taste it WOW what a meatballs..... with a delicious sauce and i have a great cappucino.
5
Looking for a laid back pub with good tapas, and a friendly atmosphere. Not a touristy place.
Really enjoyed the visit. Try the Portabella Fried.

This is one of those gems that you either find on trip advisor and think "oh I must go there" pr you stumble past while walking around and go "oh, I must put that on trip advisor."So I was the latter. If you find yourself in Chinatown or frankly you just want to get away from the modern Singapore, this is the place for you.Blink and you might miss it. Tucked away in amongst the chop houses of old. This is a modern cafe, dressed up as a 50's French cafe. The metaphors may be mixed, but the delightful service and food is most certainly not. With seats both inside and out, this can only be described as what Statbucks could have been. Perhaps independent coffee shops can survive after all. Singapore is richer for this place and I highly recommend a visit to here if only as a break when walking around China town
5
This is one of the best places to chill out. The food is great especially the garlic prawns not to mention the garlic mushrooms as well. Wide range of wines to choose from as well as mixed drinks absolutely love this place. One of my favorite places in Singapore. Staff and service very good
5
Stayed next door at Majestic Hotel and the reception staff at the hotel highly recommended The Reading Room to me and my wife.We came over and were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful décor and fantastic service by the staff.We ordered the beer on tap and some tapas.The Garlic Prawns were succulent and wonderfully garlicky. 9/10Bruschetta was refreshingly well dressed in balsamic vinegar and topped with generous amount of tomatoes and cheese.9/10Tortilla was one of the best I have ever had, even while I was in spain!! 10/10Mixed mushrooms was a delight to eat. Mushrooms were crunchy and flavourful. 9/1
5
Just near the Outram Park MRT and Dorsett hotel where I was staying, The Reading Room was a great find - a destination that offered a relaxed atmosphere, smooth tunes, cold beers and great food. Their specialty is Burgers and they have an interesting selection and nightly Burger &Beer specials. I enjoyed the Wednesday night special of a teriyaki chicken burger and Estrella Galicia beer for $25. I think the chicken in the burger was a little undercooked but still delicious. The atmosphere here is fantastic. Big comfortable chairs with low club tables and soft lighting against wall draped with books. The key ingredient though was the music, I Shazammed the songs and the album was - "Scott Bradley & Postmodern Jukebox" which perfectly complimented the mood of the restaurant. Recommend for small groups, intimate dining and solo travelers. They also offered organic wines which shall certainly be on my 'to-try' list for next visit
2
Headed across here on basis of trip advisor reviews - lovely cafe with books and eclectic decor, good friendly service but really disappointed by the food - we ordered 3 tapas - the tortilla was tasty but cold, aubergines a microwaved mess, and portobello chips tinged with charcoal. Won't be going back
5
This is one of our favourite places to head to when we want a light meal and a relaxed ambience. That said, we always end up ordering so much of the delicious tapas that describing it as a 'light meal' would be utterly inappropriate! The chef is often inventing tasty new dishes to add to the menu and the owner is so friendly and helpful that he'll happily suggest menu options to you based on what mood you're in or what you're drinking.As the name suggests, the décor very much recreates the look and feel of a grand, family library, with book lined shelves covering the walls, and board games stacked up for guests to enjoy. As a result, this is a beautiful, sophisticated venue that we can even bring our kids to, as they will distract themselves quietly for hours with books and board games, leaving us to lounge back in the armchairs and chat in relaxed bliss. I can't recommend The Reading Room highly enough. We love it here and go back often
3
Good wine selection, food was so-so - ordered tapas. The ambience is very nice. It feels like a library. On an overseas trip to Singapore, I opt to have a quiet dinner here after reading great reviews. I was the only guest in the whole restaurant. Service was efficient and friendly, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the wine. Would be back to try the coffee and more of the food
5
We were on our way to another cafe but spotted The Reading Room enroute. The charming facade looks cozy and enticed us to make a quick stop to view the place.We ended up staying for an hour and a half!Very cozy atmosphere with unique, vintage-like decoration. The coffee was average in quality but the atmosphere is the highest pulling factor for us to return the next time.Book lovers will rejoice as the place is a good, quiet hide-out from the busy world to have a cuppa and to have a good reading session. For those who want a place to chill out with friends and catch-up, there's a bigger seating area at the back for big groups. Board games and card games are also available and placed discreetly on the bookshelves - the trick is to be the first to find them!Highly recommend and will definitely recommend this place to friends
4
Very nice place for chilling with your dating partner and very friendly staff serving you at all time
4
Travelling solo I stumbled across this little cafe/bar. Great tapas, little pricy but food was definitely worth it. Great music, friendly staff - couldn't ask for much more.
4
Maybe it was the comfy decor or the nice drink menu, but I instantly felt comfortable here. Also tried the fried calamari which hit the spot after a hard day of sightseeing. Decent prices for Singapore and the beer was nice and cold. Service can be a bit spotty so that took away one dot on the review. Desserts look fantastic
5
This Fabo place is next door to where I was staying at The New Majestic Hotel China town the atmosphere and the Decor is amazing such a trendy hip little place to relax, abundance of reading Material as u relax over a coff or two the choice of Menu is amazing from heavy to light the staff fit perfect for this place very friendly young and Happy Great experience Deff worth a loo

I love food from all over the world. And when I travel, I make a point of eating at the many restaurants listed on tripadvisors. There are hits and misses from the list of course, but this particular one, The Reading Room, was definitely a spot on hit. So much so that I have decided to sign up on tripadvisor and be a reviewermysef to give this place, and other places i know that are good, the support they so deserve.The food hee is very good. You can get a good range of tapas from the traditional Spanish to italian, Japanese and Korean small bites. Tried their Spanish meatballs and they were as good as the famous ones I had in Barcelona!The antipasta was cheap, under $20 for a platter, which you wouldnhave tompay at least $30 for else where.The teriyaki chicken was excellect, with perfectly grilled chicken and a not too sweet teriyaki sauce.My wife loved the burger. The patty was thick and juicy. A really fantastic burger worth just going back for.A fantastic dining experience with great food , very friendly owners and impeccable service. The Reading Room will see alot of me
5
I was surprised a year ago when I walked in! It's one of a kind....never seen so many books other than in a library! I love the ambience ...the deco. I can see that each item is carefully thought through by the owners. The tapas are unique and delicious esp the modern japanese take on tauhu goreng, the wonderful garlic mushrooms and home-made tiramisu, and so many more. The menu changes regularly, with daily change of Tapas of The Day. I was told that the owners travel regularly and often bring back seasonal foods from Spain, Italy, Japan, ...so do ask if there is something special they can do for you. But...What is good food without good service? Their staff serve with smiling faces! All of them are friendly and helpful, the level of service we don't often get in Singapore. I have recommended a few friends to this place and they all love it!I just went again last sat night for their 1st anniversary celebration, with free canapes all night!! And the capanes were a fantastic display of the versatility and skills of the chef, with food from Spain, Thailand,japan to Italy! I especially loved the Japanese baked egg with tobiko in a Japanese broth. The reading has outdone itself again and again, it is just as good as the first time I walked into this restaurant, if not better....By the way, look out for the Newly installed beautiful antique chandelier
5
This is a nice, quiet and cozy place to unwind and have a drink. They serve the usual coffee and also alcoholic drinks and light food. Good place to chill out with friends to read (they have plenty of books) or to play some board games!(they got it too!). Friendly staff.
4
Stopped here a few times for coffee and/or wine to relax a read my book. Jake is very nice and friendly, and service was good. Comfortable areas inside and out. I didn't eat food so can't comment on that. Will definitely come back when returning to Singapore
5
I recently went back to Singapore and the first thing I did was I went to visit The Reading Room for a drink and a few quick tapas with a few girlfriends.I was immediately greeted by the owner, Jake who remembered me from the last time I was here with my group of gals! First up, I had a Margarita, which was highly recommended by my one of my girlfriends who frequents this place. She said the Margarita is to die for!!??!! And? Indeed, it was on of the best, frothy, perfectly mixed Margaritas I've had. It had the perfect sourness, sweetness and right amount of tequila!! Perfect!! I had a sip, shrieked, everybody had a taste, and everybody ordered one each!! There were many new things on the menu. What was new on the menu of the day was Yukke, a beef tartare, a selection of hamburgers and tofu Salad and alot more... From the expansion of the menu, I can see that the restaurant is doing very well, and was very busy the night I was there, with many regular customers, whom they know and greet by name! A very good sign that the restaurant is keeping up it's personal service!We ordered the Yukke, A burger with the Lot, the tofu Salad, Lava Tonkatsu and deep fried mushrooms.The Yukke came within minutes and it was really, really good. It came with fine strips of pears and cucumbers and raw beef. And to eat, you mix them all up to with the dressing and dig in! It was refreshing and fulfilling!! A must!!Next came the deep fried mushrooms. Very crispy, slightly spicy, very fresh mushrooms. We ordered the large size, and there was about 13 pieces of mushrooms. For around $10, it was a bargain!Lava Tonkatsu?! What was that?? Well, it came. Looked like ordinary Tonkatsu. Only when we cut it open, we realised it was so named cos of the cheese that was oozing out of it's centre. Surprise!! And the pork was so tender and flavourful, it almost didn't need the Tonkatsu Sauce that it came with. Upon my asking, Jake, the owner revealed that instead of using a full pork fillet, they have painstakingly sliced the pork fillet into paper thin slices and reassemble them with cheese filling to increase it's textural mouth-feel. What a great idea!! It was meltingly tender! The Hamburger came last. Turned out, Burger with the Lot is a huge burger with a 180g patty, grilled pineapple, bacon, fried egg, tomatoes and lettuce and homemade onion chutney. And when cut into, the patty oozed out melting mozzarella cheese!! Another "LAVA" idea?? Good trick to keep the cheese within the burger!! The whole burger was shared among 4 of us and we all loved, loved, loved it! Only things was the fries that came with it was a little soggy.We added a few more orders of Tapas (the garlic mushrooms ) which I reviewed previously. It tasted as nice as it was then! The deep fried Mozzarella was a good finish with it's fruity grape compote to cut it's richness.We were looked after by a wonderfully friendly waitress. She was always smiling and many of the customers were quite taken by her friendly persona. When she heard that it was actually one of our friend's birthday, she promptly brought over a complimentary Birthday Shot- flaming Bazooka for the birthday girl. Apparently it's The Reading Room's Tradition to shout the birthday boy or girl a shot of their famous Flaming Bazooka! How nice was that??We ate, had a few bottles of wines, laughed, and drank some more and the night was complete.Truly a wonderful place to spend a night out with friends. Food , although not fancy, it was well prepared and fresh. Service was impeccable! I shall visit again. This is a remarkable place to hang out!

Been here three times. The atmosphere is definately unbeatable- easy air, full height book shelves that lines the wall... Pool tables at the rear... However food is a major problem. Value for money is low- we ordered a deep fried mushroom costing $8:50, a small dish with 5-6 mushroom turned up. Pricey... we asked for recommendations and they promised us the grilled squid sas very fresh, turned up stale and awful. Another time we ordered a burger- and we told them we had a flight to catch in the evening- despite the fact that we reminded them 6-8 times that we need it served otherwise we will have to cancel- we waited 45 minutes and the burger didnt come! Had to cancel it.... Bill is the other it that we had to wait forever for. Hence in general, great place if you wanna just hang around to chat with a glass of beer, painful if you are looking for food...
5
Having been around asia for many years it is refreshing to find a calming place that is both inviting and different. The young staff made it a memorable experience!! Thanks.
4
We went for after dinner drinks.Great service and atmosphere.Had some outdoor seating but in the heat we needed air con!!
4
After walking around China town for a few hours we were looking for somewhere to rest our feet and enjoy a nice cold beer, when we stubbled across the Reading Room, such an awesome place to enjoy a drink and something to eat, kick back and relax to the music and why not play a game of snakes and ladders or read a book, loved it
5
Called in by chance first day of our holiday. Having been warmly welcomed by the staff that night, we made it our last stop every night for the rest of our holiday. The service, friendly staff, unique atmosphere, excellent food & timeless music makes the 'Reading Room' a must for everyone. Would advise all to visit and enjoy what it has to offer
5
This place is fantastic. I came in for a "look" one day and came here every day for the duration of my visit. A very good atmosphere, relaxed, good music, friendly staff and the food is excellent.No hesitation on my behalf on recommending this place to others and I will definitely come back on my next visit to Singapore
5
Pleasantly welcomed by the service team who work with passion and professionalism. If you happened to see the lady boss around, you are in luck because her recommendations of tapas and drinks are really superb! Love her personable service...Try these recommended Aubergine Stack, Tofu Salad, Garlic Prawns, Margarita etcI bet you will come back for more!!!And not forgetting the tastefully done up deco with shelves and shelves of books free for browsing and sale... you will be spoilt for choice!
4
Had a casual meal which was very enjoyable. The small plates to share were tasty and well presented. The food is not adventurous but perfectly adequate. One of the best things about this place is the decor and atmosphere. It's not just another cafe or bar and is genuinely eclectic and interesting. Staff and service friendly and professional. Wine list is good and not too pricey. I would definitely go there again.
5
I found this cafe by chance when I was going home last year. Then I tried it. Frankly speaking I didn't expect anything at that time but I knew it was quiet nice cafe. Food quality is very high with home-made taste and reasonable price!! And all staffs are incredible friendly. Especially I liked the interior & atmosphere. It's stylish but lovely. The most amazing thing is that the interior was decorated by owner. Here has become my second living room since the first visit. I can highly recommend the reading room for various purpose which you wanna a quiet, be alone, coffee break, lunch, dinner, reading book, chilling out and enjoy drinking with your friend. The reading room is really unique cafe different from the other ones. This is my only one

I had a business meeting in town and arranged to meet up in this relatively new cafe. I ordered a Flat White and a Panini. The Panini was fine, better than average, but the coffee was great, one of the best I've had in Singapore.It's a cosy place, lined with books, and it seems like a great place to hang out and chat and read... on my Kindle! I also loved the collection of antique telephones, but no sign of any Meridian Featurephones.I will be back soon
