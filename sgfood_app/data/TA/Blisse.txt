Good place for dining. Lease at the venue was up and close for good. Not able to continue and will not be relocating.

If you are looking for a quite atmosphere, this is place to be. Food are just okay, nothing really special.
Went last month and seems like new staff and the service sucks. Hope they can still maintain the service how it was before.

This social enterprise hires the disadvantaged workers like those with disabilities and it is definitely a worthy cause.The food is really nothing to shout about with simple western fare and some asian dishes that is so-so. Not bad but not good either. Price is reasonable and service is adequate.All in all, an average restaurant that only stands out because of its social mission
