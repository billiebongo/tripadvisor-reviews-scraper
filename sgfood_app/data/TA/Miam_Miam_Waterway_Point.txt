The choices are very good and we love the Japanese fusion pasta and fried rice. We enjoyed the onsen egg that goes with the signature dishes. The desserts were ok.

Good Food, a bit expensive though. if price point is 15-20% lower then will attract more customers. The restaurant was empty during peak dinner service. What a shame.

Food is nice and the service is prompt. Ordered the squid ink rice and the frutti yogurt. Value for money.
