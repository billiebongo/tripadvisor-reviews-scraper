Stopped for a drink whilst walking orchard road. good service and well priced wines. Good service. Enjoyable

My second visit to this watering hole. The food here is rather good and the ambience quite something. There is also a wide choice of wines here. Cheers!!

Location is great, food is adequate but not exceptional, wait staff is among the most blatantly rude and apathetic I have ever experienced. I’ve had friendlier waiters at Dicks Last resort. Obviously, I wouldn’t recommend this location.

We had the Surf & Turf Platter for 2 ($52) and since we had a craving for meat, we chose the beef tenderloin, beef ribeye and beef sirloin. The portions were small and the beef was disappointing as some were a bit fatty & quite tough. We also had a greek salad and some house red to go with it. The total cost was approximately $100 for two, a tad expensive and nothing memorable. And service was bad. I would give this restaurant a miss

.CHEAP WINES .. BUTSERVICE is .. TERRIBLEStaff walks pass as if they are not responsible for servicing your tableAfter 20 minutes !! a diner is sat at the adjacent tableOnly AFTER this diner is served, the waiter comes round to askingWhen asked why a new diner is served immediately when I had ZERO SERVICE and left waiting at the table for 20minutes, he replied "I am serving you now" !Really !Your CHEAP Wines and STAFF ATTITUDE is NOT WORTH my timeDISGUSTED.

If you want to enjoy the best of wine and dine with fantastic customer experience then visit the Robertson Walk outlet because the store in cuppage sucks in all grounds. Terrible customer service with staff full of attitude and wanting to close the store thrashing customers away. Here’s my experience in a nutshell — visited the cuppag outlet on Dec 10, Sunday evening. Spent almost 2 hours with $100 bill and went to use the restroom when the staff named Suman tells me “ sorry.. we are closed. You can’t use the toilet now. Go out to 7/11 and use the public toilet”. This is all happening while other customers were siting and drinking and the staff was busy closing the store. It’s not that I asked them to serve me any additional food or drinks. All asked was to use the rest room after drinking so much in their own restaurant.. The lady supervisor was equally ridiculous and non customer friendly. This was unlike “wine connection experience” in any of their Singapore joints. So think 10 times before you walk in to Cuppage joint. I would never go back and equally encourage you all to do the same. Their other outlets are so much more friendly and inviting.

Visited the Cuppage Plaza outlet on Dec 10th. Ordered wine and food. Then my wife needed to use the washroom after 3 drinks and much to my surprise the wine connection staff directed her to the public washroom next to 7-11 rather than the wine connection facilities even though the outlet was still open. Disappointing service. Will not return to this outlet. Supervisor just sat there and didn’t help.

We were there on 26november for my daugthers birthday. Sadly the services was a let down. The server was like unhappy to serve us as he was sighing when we requested to take our order and clearing the table for the birthday cake. We had take plates and fork on our own as the server wasnt there to run the tables.The food was ok... The bread that they mention was bake fresh daily... was definately not... frozen and reheated yes... please be honest when you write stuff on your menu.definately going to give this place a miss and go to another outlet to see if it going to be bette

Back at this restaurant. We have had great times previously. Not the case this time. Sloppy and cold service. 3different people taking order serving etc.My food came really quick, chilli pasta. No cutlery, no napkins, no salt&pepper etc. We had to ask. My husband seafood came later! My spicy pasta was very plain. Asked for chilliflakes and olive oil, to spice up the dish. The toilet, was horrible, the worst ever visited in a proper restaurant. Folding door, dirty and sort of in the restaurant. Shape up, step up.

Have been a steady client at Wine connection for years. Here in Cuppage and 2 other outlets in Spore. In the past two years for each of my visits at Cuppage I have noticed and felt a downwards fall as far as food is concerned (in other words the most important) and lately service and staff attitude ! Nothing to be arrogant when the dishes served are at best mediocre and so disappointing. Both food, rowdiness, rudeness of the staff and "management ?". Are today's customers so gullible and will eat anything served to them !? It looks like
5
This branch of Wine connection is perfectly situated in Cuppage Terrace, tucked behind Orchard Road. Food is excellent if you are craving some western fare and the wine deals are exceptional.
5
Really enjoyed sitting back in the busy ambience, sipping a glass of nice rioja and eating some nice cheese and cold meats. Staff were excellent and although busy, were accommodating and found a table for me to sit at. A must!
4
Our first night out in Singapore, great value for money. In a city spoilt for choice but often expensive this was a great find. Lots of choices on the menu at reasonable prices and in a great location just off Orchard Rd.
4
Always up for chill times here with friends. I enjoy the wide selection of wine although it would be nice if they expanded the food and dessert range. The quality of the dessert is so-so but the wine is surely a good reason to visit, along with the affordable wines.
4
Visited here yesterday as I needed to visit nearby. Warm friendly and helpful service. Ordered the bangers and mash - sausages and mashed potato in rich onion gravy. Delicious. Chocolate lava cake for dessert. Great selection of wine for drinking in or to take out. Went around 4pm and very few customers. Recommended.
4
I know this place has restaurants all around Asia. But after touring Asia for three weeks we just wanted a nice western meal and some nice wine. The service is good here they have a great selection of wines many of which are reasonably priced. The food was pretty good overall I nice dinner out. The area has a number of bars and restaurants and really gets pumping at night. They also sell wine to takeaway. So you can get a decent bottle without paying an arm and a leg.
5
We celebrated my Bday on 8817 and was very delighted by the service of one of the energetic and freindly staff named Jordan, He approached us while Queing up to get our table, since i was hesitant to get one because of the Large crowd and and its eve of holiday, not even waited too long he rest assured he will find a seat for us by time he come back he told us we have one! considering we are 7 in the group and he manage to squeeze in all the chairs in our table. We were extremely happy and i would like to commend him on his sincerity and care for customers. Wines are great and very affordable will definely keep on coming back
4
Great value, great wine selection. Service is mediocre when the restaurant/bar is at it's peak. Food selections can be improved to compliment their amazing selection of wines offered. Overall, a must visit
5
I always love this place and so forever grateful that I am being served with the incredible staffs like prasaad and rani (i hope i get the name right). They are superb friendly and always orchestrate with the team.If not them, I wont be comin to this place. Thank you for providing a very good service
5
My wife and I found this place on our last day in Singapore having already eaten in Cuppage Street before. Wine connection doubles up as a reasonably priced (for Singapore) wine shop with a good selection. The staff were not pushy and all over us as we were browsing, which was a nice touch compared to some of the places nearby, but once we decided to dine there the staff were very attentive and friendly! We both wanted a light dinner due to a big lunch earlier and the salads did not disappoint! The Greek salad and smoked salmon were particularly delicious! The manager that served us (lady with many pens around her neck) was exceptionally polite, friendly and provided an excellent service!I would recommend this place and next time I'm in S'pore will definitely pay a visit!
5
I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. Absolutely delicious food and, of course, vino!! They went above and beyond in terms of customer service in response to a small error. The manager was super lovely and attentive. I would definitely recommend!
3
After hearing from family how good Wine Connection is I was looking forward to eating at one,We had to wait to be seated but were being ignored until my niece started waving here hands around to get attention, the seating was great and the food was average, I had a Pizza which was not anything special, and my partner and niece were disappointed with what they had, but the waiter did keep our water glasses filled and was much friendlier as the night went on
4
Have not been visiting Cuppage outlet for a while, but the food, drink and service were still excellent. Dined at the restaurant twice last month. The drinks were served quick. What I like the best was when the staff being attentive enough to keep on clearing the dirty plates once we were done with our food. Thumbs up for the korean supervisor for the kind hospitality. One downside was they were quite slow in refilling our empty glasses, but I was totally fine with it, as we could do it ourselves. However, it might not be the case for other guests
4
*Wide Variety of wine selection. I'm not a wine person but they recommended good white wine so I guess I drink wine now*I love the cheese platter and the pizza *This Place is recommended for a chill-out-place-after-work. It's a bit crowded but I love it.*I just hate the wooden platform. It makes me dizzy every time there's someone walking near me.
4
Good selection of well tasting food was offered. Wine recommendation was spot on for our food. The waiters, however was somewhat eager to get us through the meal quickly to have new guests in. That was at times too obvious.
4
Had a great time with food and wines. I have been to all dining outlet of wine connection and have so far impress by your staff helpfulness.But just a 2 cents thoughts. Maybe should not charge a guest a birthday celebration cake request and probably your male indian supervisor can be more discreet while keeping entertaining a table of 2 korean girls which i believe a staff/friends seated beside us. Quite a turn off scene.Will be back soon
5
We have been visiting this branch of Wine Connection fairly regularly since our move to Singapore. We have found the food and service to always be excellent and the wine to be very reasonably priced. Gets very busy in the evenings on the weekends, so worth booking in advance
5
I travel internationally on a frequent basis.I have to say this is one of my best relaxing afternoons and food I have had in a very long time. Great service, good wine selection . The food , wow, had the Ribeye Steak - wonderful. Lovely setting in Cuppage Place , sat outside . A true diamond 
5
The restaurant offers a very wide range of food and an impressive and affordable wine selection. Service was great though out. That entire section of restaurants at cuppage court is great so if you don't find a seat you can just go next door. Although I would strongly suggest the wine connection. They also have the retail side for wine where the wine sells a few dollars less than in the restaurant. I will return for sure. Enjoy
4
Enjoyed the layback atmosphere and relaxed ambience of this hidden gem. Service was great Food was good quality with acceptable prices compared to other restaurants in the area. Extensive wine selection and reasonably priced for Singapore.Spent a very relaxing there hour dinner king pre dinner drinks appetisers and most enjoyable two course dinner
5
Ordered a number of items for delivery. But the lamb shank is my repeat order every time. Perfect flavors and meat perfectly falling off the bone.
5
You expect to get good selection of wine at a place called the Wine Connection, and they certainly do not disappoint with that. However, they also have great menu and well-presented tasty food.
Love it!
4
Who doesn't know this place? Think everyone does! This is definitely our go toplace whenever my friends and I want to chill, good conversations on a relaxing vibe! Wines are definitely cheap and also their cheese/cold cuts platters. Food was a so so, can be okay to those who's not a foodie. Think they just need a good chef? Because I believe good wine needs good food too! But still, will definitely go back for wine
5
Another place which had been on my mind but didn't put words in yet. The wine collection is fantastic, as is prices. Quality of food is good enough to return again. And location means everyone can gather to enjoy. Always like this chain of wine cellar since the first shop started in Robertson Quay
5
Very good food, wide selection of western food and wine.Wine is at very good price.Good service attitude
4
Whenever I think of wine, I think of Wine Connection @ Cuppage!Price is good, wine is very good, and their food has improved so much over the years.I have been going back for years, and their service seemed to have improved recently.Overall: 4/
3
There are quite a selection of wines available here. Chilling out with your friends, chatting and relaxing. Its quite a nice environment for after office hour chill out zone. Taxi stand is just a stone throw away if you drank till forgot the time and missed the last train back home. However, they should try to improve their service. I need to request for the bill 3 times only the bill come to us. Hard to call for them as well as they are not really attentive enough to look out for you.. however, they are attentive in terms of filling up your glasses... thats a plus point
1
Late lunch here earlier as their wine is reasonable priced but turns out to be a huge mistake instead.Did not thought much when the waiter removed quite a big piece of glass from our table when he sat us there.Found some pieces of food crumbs & glass where I was seated on the sofa & on the floor. Husband cut himself on a small piece of glass when he rested his arm on the table. When I highlighted to Benny, the asst manager, that the area was with pieces of small glass, he only said sorry. There wasn't even a word of concern to check if we were hurt.Fruit flies were flying around the next table and around our table & we had to keep swatting them away till to the point that we asked Vana, the manager, to remove the next table number standee as the fruits flies were resting on it. He at least offered us a change of seat.Feedback to the waitress about the pieces of glass when we got our bill & she said will tell the manager. But apparently she didn't because we had to feedback to him while on the way out of the place.Big disappointment with this place as the service was pretty good the last time I was here.Anyway, to feedback is not because I am hankering after some discount or freebies but merely to highlight that as a well known establishment, you need to ensure that you maintained some safety & cleanliness standards like broken stuff are properly cleaned up, the tables are cleaned etc before you sat the next diner especially if there was not even a full house at 4pm & perhaps, a word of concern from your staff would be appreciated

My husband and I was here on a Thursday night and was very crowded so the service was a bit slow.. The ambience was great for young people with nice chill-out music and people talking around you. We ordered a Choucroute and I found it great and authentic with french taste, one small thing though, if they could put a candle under the plate to keep it warm, the dish would have been perfect. Sausage, bacon and sauce was very nice. We had mustard and blue cheese sauce, both had a very strong delicious taste even though the blue cheese is too watery. So, I give them 4/5 for a slow service, not hot-serving choucroute and liquid blue cheese sauce. Friendly staffs! The selection of wine here has nowhere to match, from the cheapest to the high end, you will find a shelf stock coupled with recommendations from various reviews and many staffs with the knowledge to help you choose one.
5
This place was recommended by a local for its selection of wine.The place is a off licence with a restaurant attached. The wine is offered at two prices, one for take out and for a small premium to have with your meal. The dining area is also two areas either inside in the air con or a very large outside area with overhead fans.Food wise they have a fairly large menu that they deliver to a reasonable standard and again at a reasonable price
4
Nice collection of wine , cheapest wine as compared to nearby restaurants
Food was good as well
Ambience is also nice
4
The wines were very good. Some a little more expensive than the others. The food fits well with the wines they serve. Other restaurants nearby in case you want to try something else.
4
Food is good! Wine as well except the floor is to weak that when someone walk pass behind me, I feel like I'm in the center of earthquak!
5
I would be very guilty if i dont put this into writting as i always get good service whenever i come to visit this place. I feel so much overwhelmed by the service provided by one of the staff (Prasad), hope i get the name correctly, as he is superb friendly and helpful. I came today alone and the shop is full, no way i could get a seat.Prasad offered me if im ok seating at the bar counter but unfortunately someone came first before me, so ive waited for another 10 mins getting a seat. Another staff offered me a seat indoor though i prefer much seating outdoor but i see that no one is billing yet so i decided taking indoor seating. Prasad who is manning ourdoor i guess still managed to come and smiled to me showing a gesture that hoping im just ok. Ive always hope that staff like Prasad will get valued by the company as long as possible. Kudos to you
5
This is a local favourite hangout for affordable and good wine paired with food! I'm glad they expanded beyond pizza and serves more variety of food now.
1
Ordered the Pasta Carbonara and Parma Ham & Truffle Oil Fettuccine through UberEats. The pasta for both the Carbonara and Fettuccine were not cooked well and the sauce was quite bland. There was hardly any meat in both pastas, just a tiny sprinkle of bacon bits for the Carbonara and 1 to 2 thin slices of parma ham in the Fettuccine. We have eaten at many pasta places in Singapore and this is by far the worst! Extremely disappointed!
3
It's an unpretentious, unassuming place. I suggest dropping in for some house wines (or maybe even a bottle of their nicer ones) and then running off to Emerald Hill to Ice Cold Beer or No. 5 for great prawn paste chicken wings
3
Have been here an inner of times but most recently when I visited the food wasn't good. It used to taste really good with average portions and value for money. The cost is the same but the standard has dropped.The pasta was not cooked well and the pasta sauce was under seasoned.This is however a great place to drink wine! Really cheap and good bottles available
5
Very affordable alcohol, extremely friendly staff - good recommendations and service from Kavitha and Igor! Kavitha never fails to greet us with a friendly smile and a warm welcome, and this feels like a second home, which is why we never fail to return each weekend!

A friend of mine visited your establishment at Cuppage on the 20th of July, at approximately 9pm.She was seated on one of your straw chairs outdoors, and after spending some time there, left with her friend. She realized that some red spots had started to appear on her arm, but she dismissed them as spots that have came out because of drinking alcohol.However, they started to itch, and began to look a lot worse. As they hadn't disappeared after 2 days, she headed to the doctor, who then diagnosed them as bug bites.(1) Your chairs have obviously not been cleaned well, and are a health hazard to your customers.(2) Her bites have yet to fade, and as someone who works in the public section and requires to look presentable, she has not been able to head to work, and has had to cover herself up in the heat. The bites can be found along both her arms.Feel free to find more pictures + evidence here in the pictures attached
5
Good service and atmosphere, great place to hang out with wide selection of wines !! Recommended for wine lovers :)
5
The red wines there are very affordable! Staffs are very friendly as well, especially a staff named Teo Nuan Lin (: the ambience there is nice too! Highly recommend
4
No tables when we turned up so they took my details and called me when there was one free.
Food was great, well priced and great service.
Great work all around.
5
Over all Awesome customer service especially the 2 Ukrainian guys. they are always there to cater our needs.Me and my friend often spend our weekly dinner because of their Delicious food and affordable wine.The place is cozy with quiet romantic ambience.
Highly recommended!
5
Love this place. Food is very good with reasonable prices plus good wine selection. Kavitha is our favorite staff, shw always serves with a smile!
Will come definitely come back.
5
I went this wine connection with friends. The mood so nice and food is awesome. The staff her name is Merida very good attitude at service. So good experience and i want to come later again.
4
Wine Connection at Cuppage and Robertson Quay have become regular haunts of mine for the last few years.The service has been great for the most part. It dipped about 3 years ago, but has been consistently sound over the last 18 months-2 years, I'm glad to say. Wine prices are good for Singapore and they offer a large variety to choose from.My favourite and again consistent things to munch on are the Tenderloin which is succulent, thick and juicy. Its served with wedges and perfectly cooked vegetables. Mmm. It's a steal at $26 Then there's the Prawns with garlic, olive oil and chili. Just divine. Served with delicious toast to soak up the juices. Another must try.The Parma and Rocket pizza is good too- thin crus
3
We had lunch here. It is placed in a street with several restaurants, lots to choose from.I found the pasta carbonara rather bland, my husband had pasta with salmon, and it was OK.They have an extensive wine list, but a bit limited choice if you only want a glass and not a whole bottle.The price level was affordable, service was OK, not outstanding
5
We enjoy having regular dinners with my boyfriend and find the place really relaxing and cosy. Always some good traditional french dishes paired with affordable bottles of nice wine. The service is also great, especially the two Ukrainian guys who are really professional and friendly.Highly recommended
4
Cuppage road eating mall is incredibly popular.We were saying nearby and the place was mostly packed every night.The Japanese, the trattoria, the tapas bar and the food and wine connection all seem very busy.We went to the wine connection and shared a Choucroute which was a german type dish of sausage, pickled cabbage and potato, just delicious, but the choice is amazing,Pastas,pizza, seafood or just about anything else is done.Service is very good, beer prices [all belguim] is fair and the prices are average -- this area is a fun night ou
5
Visited earlier today, ordered seafood pizza, carbonara pasta and Spanish style gambas. They taste delicious and satisfying.
4
Top notch restaurant and my absolute fav place to chill out.
Food is delicious and wine selection is divine!
A definite place for connecting with wine .
5
A great place with affordable and wide selection of wines. Staffs were attentive and friendly, especially Terry, whom in particular gave good recommendation for the wines. If you are ever at the area, do check this restaurant out.
5
I am a worldwide traveller and enjoy the varying cultures of this magnificent planet. It is not very often that one comes across the the most perfect dining experience with ambience to match.I had pre reserved a window table which was honoured at the correct time, despite a very busy evening. The food , wine and service was superb and at an exceedingly reasonable price as Singapore standards go. The fact that you can select your own wines from a huge gains gallery on display was perfect. No rush at all...ones presence was respected and everything was timed to perfection. Well done. When I return to Singapore next year, this restaurant will be my first stop
4
The highlight here is doubtless the range of wines, and for me, the $36 prosecco. The bubblies fall within the $50 range, so you have enough for a second bottle - and you will want a second round. We had the Spanish style gambas (shrimp cooked in olive oil, garlic and chilli), tomato and mozzarella salad, and smoked salmon salad. Small, nutritious bites with plenty of greens. Though it was buzzing, the wait staff were attentive, efficient and friendly. I only begrudge the tight arrangement of the tables indoors...makes getting out of the inside seat tricky. Also, kinda hard not to check out diners to your left and right since you're chair to chair close. After No. 5 at Emerald Hill, this is the other drinking hole in town where you can get good drinks without burning a hole in your pocket
5
I love the collection of the menus, the staff know which wine to order which suitable with the food ! Affordable price and amazing service ! There's a Malay lady and my fav staff Vasyl whom always on TOP of everything ! I highly recommend this place for their skinny pizza, I love the carnivores and vegetarian! You'll leave the place without the guilt! Oh the onion soup ! So comforting ! As well as their cold cuts! Goes well with the wine !
5
I just love this bar from my first visit! The food is delicious and very affordable, the ambient is warm and vivid, but the best of all is the staff. Remembering me and my preferences every time I come, serving with patience my special requests, trying to always fulfill my wishes. And most of all to cheer me up after a long day at work. Always with a professional attitude and a big smile on their face. Special thanks to the Ukrainian staff - Mr Vasil, who is always taking care of me and my dear friends.We will definitely be back
5
My wife, Vijya, and I have visited this place many Fridays and the staff have made each and every visit fabulous. We feel a connection with the staff's caring and attentive nature. The warmth in their hospitality always touches our heart. Terry has been excellent with his wine recommendations, smile and great conversations. His subtle charisma and charm is a definite crowd puller. Bubbly Kavita always serves us swiftly. Rini always makes us feel comfortable. Boon Heng forever trying to get a good spot for us. Prabhu welcomes us with his lighted up face and makes us feel at home. Mike is well versed with the menu and suggests according to whet our spicy palate. It's marvelous have a team who have such great customer service. Such staff make a difference to our dining experience. Good job guys and keep connecting because you unique in ur service. See u soon. Another Friday..
5
Had dinner there with my friends, we were server by Vasil, who made a very professional recommendation regarding the wines. We had a bottle of pink Moscato and another bottle of sparkling red wine which was delicious. If you come here, look for Vasil, he will recommend a good wine for you.
4
Ms Rinie was the best. She took my reservation, I booked a particular table due to be able to convers. I preebooked the food. It all turned out great. The few things they need to work on is faster attendance when arriving. I had to go over to the counter, after 10min, to remind them we had not been able to order drinks! The forgotten to set table for 4 people, I did get the plates etc myself!! Water was space. The food was very good. Only thing would be the grilled vegetables, it was a salad with some small pieces of courgette!!!. We will be back for sure.
5
Highly recommend this wine bar down town. The wine and food was excellent. Ate prawns and pizzas with friends.
Prices of wines were excellent. A rarity !
5
This is really nice place for good wine and is affordable. .. the waiter Viemall has recommended us the good sweet white wine for the dinner... it was really good. .. I'm really happy with the dinner today...
5
Great service by Kavitha. She's extremely friendly, efficient and we had a great time conversing with her.
Wine recommended was good and service was impeccable.
Great environment. Great staff. Great value for wine and food.
5
It is recommended and favorite spot to visit in Singapore for have a relax and meeting after office hour.
5
They have fairly decent priced wines and you get to shop their retail market to pick out what you want. The food portions were smaller but quite tasty. and only steps to our hotel made it a great choice.
4
After paying for some very expensive New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs in other bars in Singapore we thought we would try Wine Connection.Great location on Cuppage and they had an excellent choice of NZ SBs all at very reasonable prices.Service was very good and all round a great place for a good glass of wine
5
Wine connection is a really nice place to hangout with friends or for dates, so far I've only had good experiences here, the wine menu is astonishing with a lot of variety, the staff us really good, Vasyl was serving me and he was paying attention to every detail and came to ask me if everything was going as I wanted, amazing experience. Definitely my favorite place to hangout
2
Went there on a Saturday evening for a good glass of wine. As a wine enthousiastic I neede one after being from home for a week. Love Spanish wines and tried their most expensive Rioja by the glass for 10$S. Quality was mediocre. Place was loaded with people but probably not real win lovers. Did not try any food
5
My family has been here many times for dinner and every time, it's been a fantastic experience. Wine was reasonable and food was great! Service from their servers Boon Heng, Vasyl and supervisor Terry was nothing but exceptional. Nothing is too troublesome and they always go all out to make our dining experience a pleasant and enjoyable one. The only grouse we have is we are not allowed to make any booking for Fridays, Saturdays and eve of public holidays which probably due to the high patronage. Otherwise full marks!
5
I came to this restaurant with some friends and we really had a good time. The food was tasty and very affordable for Singapore. It's a busy place but the staff was very accommodating. Special mention to Vasyl who took great care of our table. He helped us choose a wine and was very attentive which made for a perfect night. I would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
Wine Connection at Cuppage? is one of my favorite spot to visit in Singapore for a drink. And for this visit Kavitha was very smiley and friendly. Thank you for her hospitality:)
5
We went with our 3 year old, the food was very tasty and the prices were good for singapore. Salmon was very tasty and a hit for my very picky 3 year old, great pasta and lambchops. Will definitely return during our holiday.
4
After a wonderful shopping trip to Orchard Road, we stumbled on Cuppage Terrace and found quite a few restaurants, different types of food! We had a great dinner and this lovely restaurant. Had steak. Very nice. Right choice.
4
I had dinner here together with a college . The food was excellent and the wine suggested was good and reasonable priced. This place is a finding for people looking for a good meal.
2
We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was crowded though it was a weekday. We managed to get a table as we booked earlier. Tha ambiance is good. Food is average. The medium well steak was more like well done. The lava cake was also 'well done' as the chocolate did not ooze out as per other lava cake that we at in other restaurants. The waitress took the wrong order. My friend was served with a glass of beer instead of wine which she ordered. When we told the waiter that we didn't order the beer, he looked at us as though we were the one who made the wrong order. We waited for sometime before realizing that the wine was not going to turn up. We had to inform the waitress again of the order. She also missed out one lamb cutlet dish. We ordered 2 but was only served one. By the time my friends almost finished their main course, we realized that mine was missed out. We had to order again. Bad service experience overall. We didn't have such experience at the other outlet.
3
We know wine connection from Thailand and came here because we liked it a lot.In this restaurant, the food has been again very good, since the spices are used in such a way that mussels, prawns and fish are very delicious here.We were not very satisfied with the staff, although these were rather small mistakes: First, after giving up an order for one person, the waitress left immediately and did not give the chance for another person to order - this was very strange.Then, we ordered both starters and main courses. It seems that this is not common here because we received all dishes at once. When ordering, we did not have the impression that we ordered something unusual.We had sparkling water and despite that, our water glasses were continously filled up with new still water.At last, a funny dialogue at the table next to us, the customers were asked, whether they were ready to order and their answers: "we have not gotten the menu yet". "ah, ok." (a few seconds pause)"...could you bring it to us please?"To sum up, rather small and unusual things, but for some people these mistakes can be annoying which is a shame since they are all unnecessary and not understandable
4
Ok, so the food here is not Michelin star standard but it is decent and relatively cheap for orchard road. Wines here are also inexpensive. Casual outdoor dining area (no air conditioning) conducive for drinks, dinner and chats. Service staff, while not exemplary, do their job. All in all, a decent place for a reasonable dinner along orchard road.
3
The food is good, the wine list extensive and reasonably priced. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. My main dish came out with the entrees, so I sent it back. When the mains were brought out, my dish came out 10 minutes ahead of the last dish that was brought to the table, but without my side order which we had to chase. When we challenged that all dishes should come out together, we were told this was a bistro, therefore food is brought out when it is ready. My daughter ordered a medium steak, yet even the waiter admitted it was medium rare. We spoke to the supervisor but at no time received an apology. Very disappointing given how popular the place seems to be. Would prefer to pay more money for better service so will not be returning

Food is ok, the price is very attractive especially for wine. I did not like the attitude of one service staff who was rude. It unfortunately makes my experience not too well.The terrace is loevely otherwis
5
This place is definitely hopping. The food is surprisingly good, but you definitely go here if you like wine. The prices are great vs. other establishments in the country, and you get plenty of choices, whether by the glass or bottle (and you definitely want more than 1 glass of wine when you're there). The duck foie gras and sausage & pork belly & potato sharing plate are great.Must visit for wine-lovers
1
Prospective customers beware...although they state open until 11:30PM, according to Hitesh (who's Manager was off duty), last order is 9:50PM so they can begin cleaning.

We stopped by this place for quick snacks yesterday around 5 p.m. The Pizza is not very good today. Maybe normal chef took day off. My fish and chips, outside crispy but flour seem not cook thru so it's still wet. Quality of fish is good though. I just hv to take flour part out and eat the fish. Chips was seasons and good. Beer and wine served cold and taste good as usual. I saw service quality improvement at this time. Most of staffs kinda friendly and helpful.
2
I went there for dinner in October and the quality of the food was very disappointing. The meat was terrible, full of fat and nerves. Service could have been more attentive but couldn't expect much from this small restaurant. They have a good wine list though, compared to other bars and restaurants around Cuppage
3
The wine connection was quiet the night I visited, however the atmosphere across the rest of Cuppage was excellent, with the restaurant providing a central location to absorb it. Food was ok, although the tuna was a bit disappointing, service was a good experience as a solo diner.
4
We've eaten here 4 times this trip and the food and atmosphere are very good. The wine prices are a big draw I think - starting at around £21 for a decent Sauvignon blanc. As it's very popular with tourists and locals alike, you may have to queue at weekends.
5
Very pleasant and comfortable place to hang out... love the service there.. One of the friendly staff by the name of Boon Heng was our waiter. He always make me and my friend feel so welcoming and entertaining with our nonsense.. overall he had done a great service...!! Food and drinks was awesome....!! My favourite place to hang out or distress.. 
1
Just looking around the place I thought this would be a good place to Dine, what a mistake that was. Firstly I ordered a medium well steak, the waiter informed me that I either had to have it cooked medium or well done they will not do Inbetween, that's okay I had a cooked medium, bread bread arrived on The table, which was stale Then the waitress deliver the steak, Almost threw it on the table... By the Time I looked up she was gone, Well... I thought she's just had a bad day. Things can only get better from here right... Wrong steak was absolutely disgusting, Full of gristle and fat... The waiter knew that I was not happy with the steak and he did not ask how was your dinner, Instead he took the steak back behind the counter and proceeded to eat it.., I could see the expression on his face to say the steak was terrible... I thought you may come back and ask me how was my dinner but he didn't.... Forget about this plus there are many other places in Singapore that are much better..

Service offered here is utterly horrible especially from this Manager AMRI if i recall his name! Seriously how did you even become a manager? But i must say their wine selection is extra ordinary. This is truly the worst outlet, the worst service and one of the worst MANAGER! He doesn't have any ethicate and he is very shrude.

Came here under recommendation and was not disappointed. The price of a bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc was $32+ 10% service charge, which was excellent.We tried the mixed meat and cheese platter to start, which was good with nice warm bread and good meat and cheese selection.For mains, I had the ribs with chips and coleslaw, and hubby had the spicy crab pasta which he said was very spicy and he likes hot food, but he said it was very good. My ribs plate was ok, but nothing special.Service was good and overall the price for our meal and wine was pretty good for establishments in this locations, so we would definitely return again.The only thing I did not like was when I asked for the bill, I did not get a written bill , but a bill shown to me on an iPad. I tried to fathom if service was included, and gave up in the end as the server did not seem to understand my question either....? But overall we felt the meal and wine was well priced, so I left extra and we paid. We still did not get a paper version of our bill
4
I always call this place my place to be. Good selection of wine and food at a reasonable price. Their menu choice is just nice. I love their cheese platter. If you're lucky, the stAff will let you choose the cheese you want -- you get to choose 5 kinds. I'd love to give them 5/5 if only they would have reservation for weekends too
5
If you want to relax and have some wine in Singapore, choose this wine connections located at cuppage, Singapore. They offer different types of wine. Nice staff, they're very accommodating too.
4
Good food, nice service and, what is more important for Singapore, good value for money. Excellent selection of vines.
4
Ate here last weekend as we the wife and I fancied something 'different' than the usual places for a late afternoon snack.Although a chain, Wine Connection tries hard to be individualistic in each establishment (with their different sub brands of bistro, cheese, etc). Thus Bistro recently launched a new menu and so we settled for a pizza and some wine followed by a cheese board. Pros:-- Pizza: was excellent: crispy, tasty and hot-- Cheese: the cheese board was excellent although needed to be more at room temperature (rather than straight out if the fridge)-- Wine: the wine was pleasant and crisp-- Venue: sitting outside although still covered by a high ceiling Cons:-- Poor service: sadly the service was not good. It was slow, inattentive, there appeared to be no great understanding of the new menu; and when they brought the cheese no explanation of what was on the board leaving is to guess. Ordered extra bread and was so slow to arrive we thought they may be making it from scratch!A nice place to visit with decently priced and tasting food, but staff training needs a lot of improvement
2
Although the wine was ok, I'm sorry to say the food was average at best. The salad was made with borderline green tomatoes and my 5 year old nephew could cook a better carbonara. I mean seriously?!The service was also lacking. I've never waited so long to get my bill before
4
Great selection of wines which are highly affordable ($30 and above) when shared with a couple of friends. Food is average, good for sharing as well. At peak hours (8pm to 10pm), this place is often crowded, and the queue to get seats can stretch to an hour
3
We went to this place on July 15,2015 @8.15 p.m. Ordered 2 bottles of wine, Pizza, Cheese platter, salad, tomatoes with cheeses. All turn out GOOD and value for money which is Very hard to find a place like this. Anyhow, service was so bad. I made and eyes contact plus waving my hands to the Indian gentleman in a black long sleeves shirt and my 3 friends witnesses it that we look at me and turn his face to talk and laugh with his friends and the lady colleague. He did it to me a few times. Other Chinese gentleman was also hard to get them over too. Except the guy name "Darren". The person who's always come over every times I waves my hands to him. He's end up open 2 bottles of wine for us. As I also went to other outlet on Robertson walk. It was the same level service quality and foods. It's would be nice if company could do something with their staffs service quality.
3
Have been to this place twice and on both the occasions it failed to impress me. While food and wine is good (wine is really cheap), I feel this place is seriously understaffed and due to which the service level stays below par. Wine connection's river valley branch is my favourite and service there is better than this so I would prefer to go there.Again - wine is really cheap and food is good so unless you are willing to wait for long and okay with mediocre service then visit this place :-)

Rachel Huang Zi Yi reviewed Wine Connection Bar & Bistro - Cuppage Terrace – 17 hrs · My friend kindly recommended me to this outlet of wine connection because of the "wonderful ambience and fantastic steak". With this expectation, we purposely arrange a gathering for long time colleagues to celebrate our reunion.As they did not accept reservation after 7pm, we came earlier to wait for a seat. We were told there were no seats inside and invited to seat outside. We agreed to wait outside as we were still waiting for friends to arrive, having being assured that we will shift inside once a seat was available. We waited for over an hour and when our friends have arrived, there was some seats available but they were given to some group that has barely waited for 15mins!!!!!!!!When we confront the staff, the reason given to us was that they had to clear the queue first. WHAT REASON IS THAT? You want me to accept the fact that I had to wait for over an hour for you to give my seat to someone else who queued for 15 mins?!?!?!?!!!!Bearing in mind that we have not had dinner at this point, they finally gave us a seat after another 15 mins. But at this point, they no longer had the ribeye steak my friend recommended, and we are left with a poor selection of sirloin steak, which was tough, orders came wrong (medium became medium rare, medium rare became medium, medium well came well done).To top up the worst experience ever, we were "greeted" by a cockroach on our table when we have finished our food!! It was so disgusting to think that we have finished all our food (being so hungry) only to realize there's a cockroach in your food!There was NO APOLOGIES immediately, took their BLOODY time looking at what to do with the cockroach at the counter. We regret that we did not scream to show the whole restaurant that they have a cockroach in the house!This is truly THE WORST service I have ever experienced! Don't EVER come to this outlet for food!!!!!!!!
2
Getting more expensive and food quality worse - used to be our favourite place but they don't care about loyalty. Terrible inflexible, e.g. we wanted some steamed vegetables for a baby (they have it anyway as side on meals), not possible even though we wanted to pay. Understaffed and you have to refill your water yourself. Wouldn't recommend anymore
4
Was persuaded to go here by a colleague. Now it will be on my route forever. Eating cheese and drinking good wine at 2am is my kind fontina and these guys do it well. Go on the way back to your hotel after dancing. Better than a kebab but much more expensive.
5
Have been to Singapore on a few occasions and wish I had found this place sooner!Wine is really over priced in Singapore so to find somewhere where a nice bottle of Argentinian red and a huge platter of meats and cheeses are so cheap ($50 for the lot).Definitely definitely coming back here when next in Singapore
5
Having patronised places around the vicinity regularly, we finally decided to go for it here despite the queue...good choice indeed! dinner was great indoors and we requested if we could move to alfresco to enjoy our wine and have tapas after dinner, despite being busy, the team got us a table outdoors but what amazed me was with the place being busy, queues forming for hours, some tables being turned at least 3 times with new patrons, the team were still on thier toes with excellent service and even stopping by to check if everything is okay and all.. to all those establishments that always mentions "full house hence no proper service, lack of manpower, blah blah blah.. this place is a true example of what great service, good food, great wine selection, nice ambience.. special thanks to Rinie and all of the team.. you guys were top notch, told my friends we are gonna be changing our regular dinner/wine venue and move to wine connection! Kudos to management for a place like this
3
We thought this was going to be really lovely and for 2 of the 3 of us the food was excellent but one of our steaks was unfortunately a very bad cut of meat (only 50% edible). This happens sometimes and normally a chef would not take it personally but just replace a poor cut of steak but not here. They took the plate away and came back with the same half-eaten plate of food twice to tell us that the chef was not willing to replace the steak as this was apparently "just what sirloin steak is like", despite me also having a sirloin steak which was delicious and 100% edible. We did also order bread as a starter but it arrived after our Mains which was a bit pointless. Besides that poor customer service, the other food and wine was excellent and prices very reasonable. The waiters were very kind and embarrassed about the chefs decision not to replace the food so I would still recommend! Wine also only $7 a glass which is cheap for singapore
5
Located along a row of other restaurants with outdoor seating, this bar/restaurant looked a bit intimidating due to its decor and location. But they offer a wide selection of wines at a suprisingly affordable price. They offer wine by the glass which starts at $7 to $11 and an entire bottle of will cost around $30+. For a group of 6, we had 2 bottles which i think ended cheaper if we had our drinks at bars along orchard or somerset. They also sell wines for as low as $20. Our experience was pleasant as the staff very friendly and visible even on a packed Saturday night. The food was okay. This place is good for chilling out with friends or for dates
5
Came across this open air restaurant just off Orchard Road. Nice bistro area with a nice atmosphere. Went a second night just because the food and service was excellent. I asked the waitress how she was on the first night and she replied "killer". Same goes for this little restaurant...not extraordinary but definitely worth a visit....killer
3
We stumbled upon this place quite late at night and were impressed at the selection of wines. It seemed popular with young locals who swilled and sipped their wine earnestly. It's always good to be able to sit outside. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food but I did use the ladies' loo...which was disgusting
4
We had the pasta but couldn't decide on the wine since we weren't exactly wine aficionados. Ended up with two bottles of wine; a Shiraz and Sauvignon Blanc (can't remember which), both excellently chosen by our server Nadia. She was very polite, helpful and personable, so a toast to her and happy 2015 :

Like most of the restaurants here on Cuppage Terrace, this place is average - at best. Of course, its wine list is extensive, but the rest - service, atmosphere, food - is only average. I found the service to be quite indifferent actually. I had the Asparagus Soup, a Bread Basket and a Greek Salad - which were all served in one go. Annoying. The soup was tasty, but thin rather than creamy. The bread was dry (I thought it was toasted at first, but found a soft fresh slice under the pile of hard dry ones). The Greek Salad was basically a pile of green leaves dripping with oil, with a meagre helping of Fetta and a few olives. The dressing was bland - just oil, tomatoe and onion were scarce and the tiny bits of cucumber were even harder to find. I came here because this place seems to be one that's always popular - but I wouldn't come again

This is one of my favored places in Singapore. Went many times for business dinners, but also for private functions.They have a simple, but tasty international menu, which is rather inexpensive, but nicely done. The presentation of the food is also great.My favorite is sesame tuna, which I had several times. Also, Parma ham pizza is a great dish.The true reason you go there, however, is the selection, quality and affordability of the wine.I have gotten great advice from the staff on what to choose. Wine savvy visitors told me how impressed they were with the quality and selection, but also price.The beer is also reasonably priced, German wheat beer for under $10/ 0.5 l.This restaurant chain has several other locations in SG The one at Robertson Quay being the largest. Now a new one in Bukit Timah. The one at Cuppage Village has the most atmosphere at least in my opinion.In summary, don't go there, otherwise I won't get a table the next time I need one ..
2
Went there yesterday night and had the so called very sexy shiraz, which has been excellent, but when askin the waiter he was not able to give me any description of this or any other wine, as well as the food. The only thing mentioned was: i like this, i like that!! Which is not helpful when you visit somewhere for the first time. Will come again, but only for take away the wines!!
4
Great wines, good choice of food and really good prices. This place is always really busy people were queuing by 9 on a Thursday night. This place is amongst another 10 or so restaurants but is always the busiest. Well worth a visit.
5
A nice place to chill out over the evening with your friend. The service was good especially Ridou! My first choice whenever i wanna chill with my friends.
5
We had enjoyed the great valued wines and the Service from staffs especially Mic. He was so passionate and very knowledgeable. Will definitely go back there.
5
After giving some ideas on what type of wine we were looking for, Ridou was quick and brought an excellent bottle for us three. No up sell. No nonsense. He also offered a sampling for comparison. Thank you Ridou. Cheers.
4
they describe themselves as a Bistro, accordingly they will bring food to your table as and when it is ready. you may order from the starter menu but the dish maybe delivered last.Once you know this it is easy. Order the starter, then when it is delivered order the main courseFood excellent, wine excellent, value excellent, service average. A smile from the waiter/waitress perhaps would help
1
If by chance you are reading this review, please take this review seriously .I have never been verbally abused until I visited this so called wine connection cafe.Dreadful service, to the point of rudeness and being verbally abused by a chubby overtly rude plate carrier .I could write more about the place in the negative of course, with ease as there is so much wrong with it, but in simple words, STAY AWAY. It hurts to be so blunt and I have never advised this before, but this place deserves all I have said. STAY AWAY, ENTER AT OWN RISK
5
Good service from waitress, Nadia. She recommended us a bottle of white wine from New Zealand to match with our main course ordered: seabass fish&salmon and carbonara spaghetti. Nice taste of this cold white wine served with our hot & fresh main courses ordered. The taste of the white wine with food is simply awesome and heavenly good. Well done!
4
centrally located at orchard, right at cuppage plaza. Wine connection is the choice option for my friends and I. It carries a wide variety of wine from various regions and the prices are all reasonable. If you choose to have your dinner here, the menu offers from starters such as cold cut platter, cheese platter and mains like pasta, pizza and steaks. All these at reasonable price (assorted platter at $15). Come early because the queue starts starts around 7pm on a Sat evening.
5
Absolutely love this place. Besides the long line (which probably means many others think it's worth queuing) there's nothing else to complain about. Excellent service as well especially from Ridou. We always look for him as he gives good recommendations and very pleasant to talk to!
4
A busy Saturday night, but found a table. Great atmosphere, great service. Food selection good, beautiful piece of tenderloin cooked exactly as asked. Delicious. Wine selection was amazing as you might expect too and the best bit, the price Really good value. This was a real find along Cuppage, Orchard Road
5
My first wine tasting experience started from here. Daniel helped me on my tour of tastes! Definitely look for him for good recommendations and service!
5
This is our 1st time to cuppage, and we loved the environment. It is a good place to chill out and good service provided by Ridou, who was so helpful with wine recommendation and always serving us with a smile.
5
We really enjoyed our time here! Ridou made sure that we really had a good time here! High recommended for gatherings and if you just want to have a great Friday night! Loved it!
5
Good service and excellent wine recommendation by Daniel. Look for him if you're looking for good wine recommendation and good service.
5
Ridou is providing extra miles services and always recommend great wine for us!! Good environment to chill with friends and good & quality wine supply in wine connection too
5
We have a nice experience in wine connection during our first and second visit. Daniel the supervisor was so accomodating and Ridou served as very well as well. I would definitely recommend the place to my friends. The place is nice and the wines are cheap and first class. I would surely be back again. - grit, a satisfied custome
5
It's my numerous time to patronize Wine Connection and not even once it managed to fail me. I am impressed by the excellent service, timely delivery and friendly touch rendered by the staff.I normally don't bother to spend time chatting with the waiters and waitresses. But today is different as a group of us was engaged in casual but fun conversation with Mic the bartender and Chloe and Ridou the waitress and waiter.Mic, being a bartender, swept us up with all his corny yet funny jokes. Looking at him is even enough to make your day. Despite the ubiquitously artistic tattoos and piercing all over his body, he does seem neither intimidating nor menacing. Instead my wife was comfortable. Chloe, with the smile always ready to cheer you up, never even once sulked despite demands by customers. She will quickly dashes to you when she sees you flashing your hands up.Ridou, on the other hand is the most chatty one. He may look like a dog being excited upon seeing a cat. He never stops ranting about anything that comes into his mind. He sometimes tries to flatter you by telling how handsome or pretty you are. Well, typical Ah Beng but overall he is good and manages to crack laughter.All in all, kudos to Wine Connection and in particular to Mic, Ridou and Chloe who made our day
5
The best wine place!!! Best service best price best environment.. All the best wine in the world at an affordable price..A place to enjoy with friends.. gossips over wine.. best!!!Recommended 5 starsServed by Daniel, Ridou and KevinGood knowledge of wine.. thanks guys..
5
Excellent service, huge selection of wine with prices that are so affordable = guaranteed fun! My friends and I had such an awesome time we found it hard to leave! Ridou was so attentive to our requests and always serving us with a smile. Thank you for the wonderful experience! We will definitely be back for more
4
Unbeatable prices, wide selection of wines, been there many a times and still trying new bottles on top of favourites. Atmosphere was great to hang out with friends over quality crafted food and wine variety to last the night. Especially loved the "Chardonnay on Ice".Room for improvements with regards to service, especially male staff (or was it because we were a table of 4 guys?). However, our table was greatly appreciative to Nadia who has mixed bloodline of Indonesian and Indian descent. Made our night with her friendly smiles and small talk,despite being new in the job. Kudos and hope this review offer her some recognition in a job well done tonight. Cheers
4
the service was great - good product knowledge and recommendation, constant checking up on customers, especially being served by Lerin
wine selection was great, the outdoor seating was cooling in the hot and humid weather. will come back again on a less crowded day. (:
4
We dined at Wine Connection at Cuppage Terrace this evening.We arrived around 6:30pm and were offered the choice to sit inside or outside.We chose to sit inside and were seated with menus immediately.The restaurant has a large wine list including beer and cider which are reasonably priced.The menu offers a range of dishes including cold meats, cheese, pasta dishes, pizzas and steak.We all had beef tenderloin which was delicious! Better then some pubs serve up in Aus!Service was good and the staff were attentive. Would definitely recommend
5
Great place to spend a quiet Monday night. Great ambiance, satisfying choices of beverage, and pizza was fantastic! Service was great throughout the time spent there. Nadia, especially, was very helpful with the beverage and food selection, as well as seat recommendation. Great service and great spirit has been shown by Nadia making us tourists feel like home. With that I would definitely return and invite more friends along
3
We are a big fan of wine connection. The price of drinks is the best I have found in Singapore. This was our first time to the Cuppage venue and while we loved the atmosphere here the food and service were not up to the standards of the others. the menu was boring and the food nothing more than average
5
Took a trip down to Wine Connection with a few friends for a birthday dinner cum celebration a few days ago and was simply enthralled with their incredible service and affordable rates. Being a huge fan of pasta, I decided to try out their aglio olio and boy, was I impressed with it! What fascinated me the most was the incredible service rendered by a staff named Kevin. Not only did he exhibit excellent knowledge in wine, he recommended one the best Chablis I've ever had in a long time. Been to other restaurants along Cuppage Terrace, but my first time here will, without a hint of a doubt, not be my last. Kudos to the Cuppage team for making my best friend's birthday a memorable one with their wonderful package worth of incredible service, fantastic food, and delicious wines. And once again, special thanks to Kevin for making our trip to Wine Connection fun and worthwhile. See you again soon
5
Wining and dining made enjoyable yet affordable. Dinner and drinks with a friend there the past weekend, was greeted with an amazing atmosphere and even better service. I would especially like to mention both staff Izyan and Ridou for their commendable knowledge and recommendations in our food-wine pairing combinations. Excellent service from these two. Look forward to my next wine connection experience at Cuppage Terrace! Two thumbs up (
5
We have found one of our favourite new spots in Singapore. The diverse wine selection, incredibly reasonable cost (especially given the relative cost in other establishments in Singapore), friendly and comfortable atmosphere, and excellent service make this one of the best spots to enjoy some wine and tasty food. The professional service of the team, and the skills of the management really make the difference. We have already made our next reservation...and to bring friends. That says it all. Well done Wine Connection
5
I went to Wine Connection last Saturday and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was not only efficient but friendly. I particularly remember the manager serving my friends and I. His name is Emre. He was very attentive, quick and friendly. My friends and I eat at a lot of places and we don't usually try out new things. However, we made an exception for Emre. He was very convincing about getting us to try the desserts there and guess what? We did not regret it at all. So if any of you are contemplating looking for a good place for food and drinks that is most importantly affordable, this is the place to go. Do look for Emre and try out the Creme Brulee, you would not regret your dining experience. :
5
Went to wine connection today Really value for money and lovely service . I like the manager soooooo much !!! She was seen going to some table asking how things were. When she came to us, we could see that she was really genuine. Staffs were really friendly and service was almost flawless. Will definitely come again very soon! One of the best in Singapore! Good job
5
Wine connection, a great place to sit and have a fragrant slice of cheese accompanied perfectly with an aromatic glass wine. With a broad and colorful choice, you'll definitely find what you fancy. And if you don't know what you like, the staff are very well versed with the menu and very friendly. All in all, a very enjoyable night
3
If you don't want to take any risk, go there. Good food, good surroundings.
A bit noisy though, if you want a bit more silent try to find a rooftop!
4
We were staying close by and enjoyed our experience dining here. It's not fine dining but the food was lovely, the environment was relaxed enough to bring the kids, Staff were friendly and service was quick!
4
Cafe style dining nice reasonable priced menu with great wine selection & good pricing for Singapore. Shared a meat & cheese platter with a very nice italian red that was recommended by the knowledgable wait staff.
3
Reasonable food. Worst service I have experienced in Singapore (or other countries). Attempted to buy 6 bottles of wine to take home, yet still ignored for over fourty minutes. Atrocious.
3
We ordered mix cold cut and 2 glasses of red wine. Mix cold cut: 3 types of meat, 2 types of cheese, and some salad as condiment. Had to wait very long (35min); we arrived 11:15pm, food arrived 11:50pm, and staff apologised for the delay stating there was a problem with the oven, which they only needed to heat the pieces of bread. Why not toast it in a hot pan instead? An oven problem is no excuse for this long wait. They could've chosen alternative (open kitchen: we saw the one lady chef just standing chatting!?). On top, half of the salad was spoiled and we had to ask to have it replaced. Another wait... Overall a disappointing experience. Not planning to return there
5
My friends and I have frequented Wine Connection for years now for its extensive yet affordable wine selection (the Moscato d'Asti is our favourite). Love the chill atmosphere and I recommend sitting outside on a breezy evening. A great find amongst a slew of pricier drinking places along Orchard Road
4
Not sure why but wine is much more expensive in Singapore than most other countries I have Ben to. But this place is the exception. A good choice and reasonable prices food was good also ranging from the margarita pizza woofed down by our grandson to the crusted chicken breast. Very popular and crowded on the weekends so try to go earlier in the week
5
We went on a Sunday night for dinner. There was a vast selection of wine from all over the globe. Everything from the cheese and bread plates from the sides with our main courses was fantastic. I recommend either the seabass or the salmon. The duck was quite good as well
5
This is obviously a city with awesome restaurants, and those come at a price. Wine Connection is brilliantly priced, but this thumbs up review follows a dinner that went pear shaped but was quickly fixed. After returning 3 rib eyes because they were slim after being assured the tenderloin was not the thick cut, management swung into action and produced 3 rare steaks that trumped the best a month in France and Italy could muster. Throw in a 10% discount for the whole meal, and sincere apologies from staff, we would happily return any time
3
I love this place. Great value wine. Possibly best in Singapore. Pizzas great. Meat and cheese platters good (not amazing). I will keep coming back. But you need more staff on Friday's and Saturday's. Please sort it out.
5
The food is indeed delicious with great wine selection. The wine pairing with the food is superb. Love the desserts as well.
4
Service providers are excellent even though it always busy, the servers are really attentive to the us. food taste really good and so are the wines.
It really affortable and somemore they are locate in the city
4
Great place to come to after work and have a crab fettuccine, lime pie and a French Riesling! Great vibe, great service (Joshua!) and a lot of eye candy! :)
5
I had a perfect cooked tenderloin paired with a perfect wine.
Liked the outdoor dining but still sheltered for the rain and wind. Good location, good food.
5
The best about this place is the great value for money. Other restaurants with the same quality, location and standard easily charge double! This is one of the few places where you don't feel that Singapore is now the most expensive city in the world. Highly recommended to recharge with a nice glass of wine and some good food after an exhausting shopping day:) The service is good too and the ambiance nice because the whole little street is a covered historical shop house row, so it's uniquely Singaporean but yet just a stone throw from Orchard. Highly recommended
3
We had visited many Wine Connections in Bangkok and really enjoyed themWe wandered off Orchard Road and this place hasd a good atmosphere set in a street with other restaurantsWe were quick to be brought water but slow with taking and bringing the drinks orderMy wife's Sea Bass was good but my spicy Beef salad was unexceptional .A bit bland The Sauvignon was ok , pils beer good and when at room temperature the Georges Duboeuf Merlot was great and complimented a nice cheese plateWas chilled at start and did tell manager who did listen and rectifyMaybe next time tell us what the cheese is?Good rather than greatLearn from your BKK cousin
1
May 2012 I wrote a wonderful review about this place, complete with photos of the dishes and concluded that we would come again; and we did many times and it has always been the three of us... until this evening... we were denied a table for four and were given a small table for two which would just be enough for two plates. There were no tables for three. The female attendant insisted that she would add a third chair on the side but failed to understand that the third person also needs a table space for the plate and at least one glass ! When we told her that we would get the outdoor table- she told us that it would be similar arrangement outside as well. We asked why we were being discriminated being three of us. She said because it is Friday night. We have been coming to this place often- and wonder if it has changed management who strongly discouraged guests of three. So make sure if you are a group of three, don't waste your time to try to get a table here. There are a lot more friendlier establishments next door who will welcome you with open arms

The row of restaurants and bars along Cuppage Terrace are numerous. Five Izakaya, Viva Mexico, etc, but price-wise Wine Connection Bar & Bistro was the best! Though Five is comparable, the wine selection here at wine connection is massive and I do mean MASSIVE. Most bottles are priced at about $35-$40 which is very, very affordable. They taste great too, no nasty-cheap quality stuff here at all. Best Iâ€™d say for drinks in Orchard

They carry reasonable price winery. Dishes are okay. Considering the price it's okay. I assume it's always busy so somehow the service is awful. I had to ask three different staffs for help. They all told me another person will attend to me since they are busy. Really??!!!!

This restaurant hosts themed wine dinners a few times a month, according to different countries' cuisines and wine. I went for their Chilean Wine Dinner and their food was terrific! One of the appetizers was this tomato-based pasta that I still think about sometimes, something about the sauce is addictive. The main course, beef tenderloin, was also done just right. Ripe and juicy, served with mashed potatoes, really terrific. Of course, the wines were wonderful too. Really liked the chilean Chardonnay

Been here numerous times and never disappointed thus far...
Wonderful place for friends to hangout and chitchat, or to celebrate a successful biz deal!
Can get a bit loud but that's what it's all about - buzz and excitement :)

Great varieties of wines but fewer choices of food.
Regardless, the food are delicious at cheap prices and wines too.
Love the ambiance.

i love most of the wines i tried at wine connection, and the food there is value for money. I have been to other outlets at robertson quay and i think they are great too.

After reading some reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to try "good wines" like everyboday say and they are not wrong . The ambience is great . We like also the service . However it s pricey . But you had better try once when you visit Singapor

I've patronised the original branch of Wine Connection for years and enjoy it, though not usually for dinner. However the experience at Cuppage was awful. No attention to service at all. Seated next to a staff member doing the books - keep it back of house! Moved outside.Took 15 mins to deliver a glass of riesling. HAd to go to the bar to place food order as waiters seemed not interested. Spicy beef salad was neither spicy nor bearing much evidence of beef - really the tiniest amount of overcooked meat... take a look at your menu and try to serve as you advertise it... We both ordered pasta, I had finished mine by the time my wife's plate arrived... and it arrived with spaghetti, not the tagliatelle as advertised. Come on... this is akin to a Chinese restaurant running out of rice. A 10% discount doesn't really make amends - in hindsight I should have removed the service charge. We settled the bill in cash, which they picked up. As we were leaving they asked us to pay our bill... clearly insinuating we were doing a runner. Outrageous

We have been there eating just a Pizza but than we wanted to try some new wines on the list to combine with hard cheese and Ham and we bought a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino Capanna which is fantastic and very traditional style it is a must to try...as well as we wanted to top the evening and we decided to go for a Barolo from Cascina Bruni which is ether amazing even if little modern style

The good:- Friendly [but stressed] staff- Greek salad was pleasant- Wine at affordable prices in downtown areaNot so good:- There's a high-up roof over the whole area here and the heat can build up but you won't get wet if it rains.- Asked for a glass of 'house white' but nothing arrived as I ate my salad and 30 minutes after ordering I was told that they don't have a house white... Although it was shown on the large board above the bar.- New software on the iPad ordering system is awful: no printed bills until you've paid can't zoom in to see the bill server has to stand over you as you peruse the bill split bills not available now- No one offered me a second glass of wine all night and buying your own at the bar is best described as complicated...If we hadn't arranged to meet colleagues at Wine Connection, we would have walked off and gone somewhere else. One of our group spoke to a staff member and the service charge was removed from the bill.In fairness, colleagues have visited many times before and it's been fine.Main message: Groups beware on busy nights. If there's just two of you, you'll probably be alright as long as the wine list is up to date and they tell you if a wine doesn't actually exist! If you want to split the bill, bring cash and figure it out yourselves as you go along..

We have been to this bistro several times and will continue to go. We always feel so welcome, the wine and food are very good and prices are among the best value in Singapore. It is so pleasant to sit outside eating my apple crumble and drinking a glass of wine. Xin is such a wonderful, welcoming person. She immediately checks in the kitchen when she sees me coming to see if there is apple crumble left when we arrive late in the evening since she knows it is my favorite. She is one of the reasons we enjoy our time there and come back! Everyone there is so welcoming and pleasant. Food, wine, location and nice people

Love Wine Connection. Value for money in a city that is notoriously expensive when it comes to wine. Also have great cheese plates with lovely choices of cheese. The meat platter is also delicious. I can highly recommend a visit to this lovely spot just off Orchard Road

This particular bar is tucked away behind the shopping malls of Orchard road but must not be missed. The location is simple but atmosphere is really good. Wines are even better and great value and they dont do a bad pizza either. They have a bistro type menu so nice and easy with a good glass of wine. The cheese platters are also amazing and real value for money.The only downside for me is that there are a good 8-10 bars/restaurants in Cuppage Terrace and some are competing with their music including live music so it can be quite noisy and the music really clashes sometimes. It would be good if the restaurants/bars could all come to an agreement to share the music waves and the service could also be a little better and faster........ all in all a really nice place for a chilled evening with good friends, food and wine
