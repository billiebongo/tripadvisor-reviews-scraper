Went here to have a quick lunch. It did not disappoint. Food was less than 10 min wait and I was in and out in 25 minutes. Limited menu but has all the staples and a good range of drinks.
5
Awesome taste, presentation and staffs are friendly and there behaviour also excellent, restarunt very clean and look nice, visit again ....tks

We were fortunate to stumble across this Coffee shop recently - excellent ambience, incredible coffee and all in all, an amazing experience. Highly recommended for any coffee lover visiting Singapore.
1
Had the Wooley eggs dish here and about an hour later had the most incredible upset stomach. I attribute this to cross contamination in the food. I like to leave reviews so that other customers know the good & the bad and in this case all I can say "eat at your own risk" - Also the bathrooms are beyond horrible. I hope that the owner of this restaurant is reading this you need to communicate to your staff better sanitary issues and a cleaner environment. Wish I could leave negative stars!!

I usually come here for a Saturday morning coffee which I always enjoy. Today I came for breakfast.......ordered scrambled eggs with toast and asked that the toast be toasted until brown. Breakfast came and only 1 side of both slices was toasted. Sent it back, returned with good toast but before I could start eating (thankfully) I found a with a short hair in it (showed the staff and they took it back immediately, clearly not my hair). Came back with under cooked 'toast' again, sent it back. I gave up after that and cancelled the food order! Iced coffee (flat white) was very good though. I do like this place but was disappointed on this occasion. Did they charge me for my coffee? Yes, they did and I paid without a fuss

Read good things about Toby's and breakfast there did not disappoint. The poached eggs on toast with a side of salmon and mushrooms were very very good. Sourdough bread could have been better but overall as close as you can get to a good Sydney eggs on toast breakfast. Also tried the tempura mushrooms and the fries. Both portions were generous and tasted good. Air-conditioning was a little noisy (we sat under one of the units) and service was so so but we will be back as the food was good
5
We enjoyed popping in to Tobyâ€™s estate for a light lunch along the river. We arrived with our granddaughter in a prism and were made very welcome. I ate an avocado poached egg salad with an apple, carrot and ginger juice. All very fresh and healthy. The food arrived quickly and without fuss. We sat outside under fans but you can also eat inside in air con... a lovely experience
1
Read some high reviews about the speciality coffee. Unfortunately the filtered coffee was burned and over extracted, not enjoyable at all. Ordered food which they forgot about as well after waiting over 30 mins we ended up cancelling the order. Staff need some more training on making specialty coffee. Try another place in singapore to get your coffee fix.
2
With it's high rating, I decided to pay a visit with my friend from other country. We had a croissant and a waffle.The croissant was not crunchy like what we had in other patisserie and the waffle was disappointing. While the waffle was served hot, it was very dense and wet as if the dough wasn't properly kneaded.The waiter was concerned about this and changed us a new waffle. It came the same. The waiter did not charge us for this. We were quite disappointed with the food here despite the high review
5
I had been here for brunch with my husband and we had great experience with this place. I had read a few reviews about service what people had and it was bad. I got little worry in my mind though i made it. I don't understand why people had bad experience there but i would like to say they were so nice and friendly! After the first experience, i went there again by my own for buying two coffee beans. All of sudden, i met the worst squall in my life and it let me stuck in the place for a long time. The staffs gave me a bottle of water and let me stay there until it stopped. I really love Singapore for some reasons and it rooted from the kindness of people. Oh coffee was really great and beans as well. Thank you so much for amazing experience
5
staying at m social and figured id try something other than the hotel buffet. Anyways rediculasly tasty. nice big airconditioned space.very satisfied
4
Toby's Estate is a one of the best place to have some good coffee on Quay. very friendly staff and fast service
4
The coffee here is strong with an oomph. Also had the breakfast (french toast & eggs benedict) which were tasty. Meal for two came up to about S$50 which was on the pricey side but ok to splurge on for a lazy weekend breakfast.
4
After a few days without coffee, this place was a great find. Coffee hit the spot and breakfast was just what we needed. The French toast with maple bacon was a big hit with my wife.
4
Would have rated them 5 had their service was at par with their food. They are under staff I guess. The staffs are used to ignoring hands raising up for service probably. Its a western cafe, after leaving you the menu, they should be back with your orders and they werent that full when we dined. Anyhow, hope they improve their service part.Would give another try
4
We tried here twice for breakfast during our visit to Singapore because the food and setting next to river were great. I think the staff are very inexperienced rather than rude but the food made up for it. We tried the eggs Benedict, one with prosciutto and one with tender beef, as well as the fluffy French toast, eggs on toast and kids' pancake staff. All were very good. Prices ranged from $14-20 for each dish. The coffees were good too. Both times the staff seemed a bit unsure what to do with themselves and we had to chase up our orders. Food came quickly but the coffees took a while. They were worth the wait. It's in a good location and was a nice walk along the river from our hotel. If you can get past the service (or they get sone training), then it's worth a visit.
3
We went late on a Friday morning and the service was less than stellar. When we asked to have the specially brewed coffee, the server said it takes 25 minutes, when we asked for another brewed coffee he said at least 15 minutes, so we just had espresso. It was like he didn't want to be bothered to make it. We both ordered double espresso and one cup came out full and the other with just a sip. When we asked they said they were the same size. Whatever. The French Toast and waffles were just ok. Came out really fast and not too warm, so not sure if they are pre-made and just warmed up or not. Server never came back to check on us or ask if we wanted more coffee. Wouldn't recommend this place
2
Toby's is in a great location in Robertson Quay along the river. We (correctly) assumed an Aussie would have some pretty good coffee. This turned out to be true. We (wrongly) assumed we would find Aussie-style service. But the Staff appeared uninterested in the guests. They delivered our meals 10+ min apart. This kind of "never-mind-the-customer's-dining-experience" and "serve-it-when-the-chef-cooks-it" rather than serving food to guests at the same time given they obviously came to dine together, is common in Singapore. Well, at least at cheap, locally owned and operated Hawker Center food stalls. We just expected we would not find that kind of indifferent, transactional service at Toby's. We were wrong. Not somewhere we'll bother giving a second chance.
2
Used to be a fan of the coffee and the hubby and I enjoyed watching the barista at work. However, during our 2 recent visits, service was terrible. Stood at the entrance for a good 10 mins, watching staff running around and completely ignoring us. When we finally got a seat, we couldn't get the attention of anyone to place our orders. The food took a while to come and tasted average. You can get good brunch food anywhere else. The bill, as expected, took so long the hubby went to the counter to sign and retrieve his card. Fortunately the good coffee and the 1-for-1 on Entertainer saved the day. Not sure if I'd come back if I had to pay full price. The service staff looked young and inexperienced. They sure looked liked they were having fun, but lack training. If I had a choice, I wouldn't be paying the service tax
2
Visited for brunch. Chai latte was good, and i had high expectations for the eggs benedict coming next. Sadly the eggs were left boiling for too long, yolks were hardly runny. The Hollandaise needed help - was pretty tasteless.Loved the relaxed environment. Not the food
3
I had the big breakfast, scramble eggs are done just right, but the honey bacon was a tad strange. Texture was a little like chewing on plastic. Roast tomatoes had excellent flavor but it stops there. The toilets are off site with poor/no ventilation.
5
It's a great place to grab coffee - coffee is good but if you like your coffee hot, request for it! There's also free-wifi in the cafe and the view is pretty awesome!
5
Found this place by accident while walking by the river. Stopped for breakfast, and ended up eating here three days in a row. Excellent for breakfast/lunch and coffee. I highly recommend it if you are in the area!
4
During my stay at River View I had breakfast here a couple of times. Friendly and helpful staff, and good food. Try their special cold coffees - they are great. My photo is of the Horchata (Orxata). Sweet but good.
2
I dropped in for a coffee, the coffee was great, smooth and wonderful flavour but....... Whilst it was busy there were at least 10 wait staff, my order was taken promptly then a 20 min wait for a cafe latte, then another 10 min wait then a reminder to get the bill delivered. During that time I could see at least a. couple of the wait staff looking a bit lost and wandering. Disappointing service let down a good coffee
3
Toby's Estate has a very warm and cosy ambiance, it's a nice place for a relaxing brunch or a casual workplace meal. I tried the Rodyk Egg Bendict subbing mushrooms for the Salmon & a Mocha. The Brioche was fluffy and soft, the mushrooms were well done too. However, the eggs weren't poached, rather they were soft boiled, and the Hollandaise was flat and tasteless. The Mocha was really good.Good coffee, passable food - may go back just for coffee in a relaxed environment
3
Visited Toby's for brunch on a Sunday.Service was reasonably friendly and fast.Food was ok, but not special.Coffee was despite other reviews not as good as in other restaurants e.g. Kiths which is just around the corner.We sat outside and it was noticeably dirty around. Plastic plates and bags between the plants around the seating are. Fans with lots of mold on the grills blowing above our heads.All in all not impressive and not worth the price
3
Been to the Cafe a couple of times whilst staying near Robertson Quay. Yesterday called in for a couple of ice coffees to cool down from the midday sun. That is exactly what we got. Warm black coffee and ice cubes. Yuk! The only positive being that the ice and coffee were in the same glass!Didn't worry about eating after the coffee saga.
4
I'm a big fan of Toby's Estate:1. Fantastic location on the river, especially now as parking is available in the new carpark around the corner2. Fairly decent WiFi3. Great Coffee and Food, at a very reasonable price.Reading some of the negative reviews, I've never encountered bad or slow service - everyone has always seemed quite attentive
4
This coffee place is very reminiscent of the better coffee places in Melbourne. Large open spaces, high quality coffee and good quality food on offer.Staff were courteous and quick, the view from inside via the large glass windows or outside on the shaded seating area well thought out.Coffee as good as you'll get anywhere
3
We stopped in for breakfast on. Sunday morning. The coffee is excellent no doubt about it. However, the service was average at best. There were several wait staff but they didn't seem to be doing much and were pretty slow at responding. Shame.
5
Best breakfast and brunch with the best selection of coffee styles. Nothing to dress up for - very casual. All types of eggs, ham, salmon, sausage, you name it they have it.
Coffee lovers your in heaven - they do have tea
4
Coffee good, would like to see more variety on the menu, however that which is there is good. Staff friendly and professional
3
Tried the french toast, not bad but I think it's just average. Coffee is pretty good. Would like to try the sandwiches, but they were served in the afternoon.
4
Great spot by the river, good food, friendly staff etc.,
Staff also informed us that this restaurant is also in Sydney so we shall definitely visit.....Thanks Guys!
5
Almost every morning I come down to Toby's to get my caffeine fix. I love the coffee as much as I love their place and the staff.
Highly recommended.
5
I took 10 km walk from and back to the hotel to try their coffee and I don't regret it at all. Best coffee in Singapore , I ended up having two large cups of latte and I bought the broadway beans too. Must visit for coffee junkies
5
Here's an amazing place for a late Sunday breakfast. Superb. Great combo choices and well prepared coffee. Looking forward to return and explore more of the menu as much as having easy breakfast when I have time. Location is pleasant and walking distance from home. Awesome.
5
When we arrived at the cafe at about 11am, there were about 6 people in the queue already. Thankfully we didnt have to wait long, only about 10minutes. It was lovely to see that Tobys Estate is pet friendly. Service was prompt and so was the food and drinks. I had the Brooklyn eggs benedict and it was to die for. Perfectly poached eggs on a soft brioche filled with the most tender stewed beef. It came w a side of very flavourful mushrooms.The coffee was very good...so much better than most cafes which can be sour. My latte was yummy. I intended to purchase a bag of their coffee beans but unfortunately they were sold out. Apparently they replenish that blend of coffee beans every Thursday and sold out by Saturday. The cafe had a very good ambience, service was effiecient and the food was awesome. Will definitely be back for more ! Thumbs up. 
5
Started a busy day of shopping here, beautiful location on the Singapore River. Such fast and friendly service and THE BEST french toast I have ever had! Cold brewed Columbia coffee really hit the spot. Free wifi to help us plan our shopping route for the day. We were in, ordered, eaten and done within 30 minutes! Will be back for breakfast tomorrow for sure
5
A delightful peaceful walk along the river and good food and coffee while we people watched. Lovely happy staff.
5
Great coffee and French Toast. Good portion and prices are reasonable. Enough staff to go around and service us. Usually this is a problem in Singapore as most places are understaffed. Try the big breakfast and the espresso shots. Thick and strong.
5
Nice little eatery next to the river to have breakfast.
Good range of coffee and meal selection with both indoor and outdoor
5
Tried their french toast and manual brew chemex . One the best brunch in singapore . Their pancake is also good
4
We ate here twice during our three day stopover for breakfast. The food was superb and the staff ( as everywhere in Singapore are attentive polite and always look happy) it's right on the bank of the river and you can eat inside or outside.
5
Perfect little spot for a coffee! Waning coffee, beautiful view along the river and great service! Can't ask for much more!
3
Specialising in coffee roasters, the story of how Toby’s Estate start was quite interesting. It started off with a coffee plantations of Brazil, Guatemala and Colombia, where founder, Toby Smith, which explains the name of the café, learnt to grow, roast and cup coffee at the source. You will be able to find a wide variety of speciality coffee beans, from local blends to many Single Origin coffees from all over the world right here at the Rodyk Street outlet. You can also grab some teas as well as coffee equipment here too.Read more about our dining experience on darrenbloggie.co

This cafe seems to be very popular with the expat community here in Singapore. On weekends and public holidays, the cafe is crowded during brunch time.There is an out-door sitting area, beside the canal with large parasols and electric fans. The in-door sitting has very high ceilings and plenty of natural light.The food served here is unpretentious and fresh. I like the French toast and the cafe latte. The portion of food is quite generous, the toast is thick but fluffy.The only drawback is the lack of restroom. The public toilet is quite a distance away for family with young children it is a bit of a hassle
3
As we arrived it looked like a really nice place for Sunday brunch.. with a cozy atmosphere. However once the food arrived we were less than impressed. There was nothing special about it... and it really looked like everything was thrown on the plate fast food style. Not great value for money... you can easily find better.
5
I went here for breakfast several times because my hotel breakfast was overpriced and not very good. I loved this place. I was able to sit outside by the river and it was peaceful and a soothing way to wake up in the morning. Their coffee is delicious, the staff very friendly and helpful, and their scrambled eggs on toast were extremely generous and overwhelmingly tasty. They also have musli and pancakes that were good as well. The prices are excellent and way better than elsewhere. did not try anything else there, but would definitely recommend for breakfast. Perfect start to the day
5
In Singapore on business, 5 mins walk from the four points Sheraton. Had the eggs benedict. And they nailed it. Best I've ever had. Coffee selection is great. Staff was very pleasant and attentive. Will return.
3
Regular coffee and not what I was expecting, as I've heard.
Not only are Ethiopian coffee and don't like much.
The price was exaggerated French toast $20.
5
Excellent service and friendly staff. Really appreciate their help for our birthday celebration! Food and coffee are so good!
3
I dropped in for a coffee and snack as I was in the area. This place is unlike other coffee shops in that you only order at the bar if you are looking to take away; otherwise it's table service. This wasn't clear and resulted in me loitering awkwardly at the bar for ages... having been told to find a table for table service, I was then getting ignored there for ages too! Once I eventually managed to flag down a waitress, the service improved. The coffee is not bad (but not as good as Australia despite being an Aussie brand) - if you are ordering food, bear in mind that the portions are pretty big. My side of fries could easily have served two. Overall it's a nice coffee shop but the awkward setup over ordering and service left me feeling a little disappointed. (On the plus side they have a nice outdoor space on the river with plenty of fans to keep you cool, and it was obviously popular, so maybe I just had a bad experience.
3
Cycled there for breakfast. Coffee was good but maybe not as good as I expected. Had the big breakfast. Sausage was coolish naturally having been cooked earlier. Maple bacon a bit too sweet for me. Mushrooms tasted like pre cooked as well. The poached eggs were fresh
1
Just sitting with my Wife and one of our daughter's at Toby's.Coffee is OK, but not as great as some people have raved, service is really bad.Slow (and it's not that busy), and when you get dirty cups that your drinks are served in its doesn't make for a great experience.Key thing they have going for them is the location.Enough said
2
I've been a big fan of this place ever since it opened. Great strong coffee and a decent menu for brunch. Went recently with my kid and despite being busy, we were shown a seat pretty quickly and given a high chair. Asked twice for a menu and ordered immediately. My breakfast arrived five mins before my coffee and the little lad's babychino arrived as I was leaving! Also the portion sizes on the scrambled eggs and toast have reduced by about 50% since I was last there. One piece of toast and about an egg and a half of scrambled. It's a shame as it used to be good value and good service... no manager available to talk to and no one asked if everything was ok.
2
Nice place to sit outside by the river. Coffee was good but food was terribly disappointing. I ordered the Woolly Style eggs benedict which was presented with a pile of what appeared to be hollandaise sauce squeezed directly from a squeezy bottle! Not good enough from a cafe and at this price
1
Well, finding somewhere open for breakfast on Boxing Day is challenging, but then Toby's estate popped up and with memories of the great sydney institutions, thought this would be equal. Sadly, nothing of the kind. Our order was taken correctly, but executed incorrectly several times. They couldn't get it right sadly.
4
Terribly busy brunch spot on weekends and tables are mostly communal seatings unless you want to sit outdoors. Food was mostly nice: 2 burgers (not bad!), 1 salad (small portion but tasty), and 1 french toast (middling). Coffee was good though. Hard to carry a decent conversation with friends due to the noise. Pick another spot if you want to actually talk and listen.
2
A great ambience in this breakfast spot and the food wasn't bad but the staff were very unfriendly. All our meals cane out at different times and the staff seemed to resent tourists.
5
I love this coffee, located directly at the riverside. Wonderful sandwiches and burgers, delicious coffee. My warmest recommendation.
5
This is a great place for breakfast a huge range of foods and coffee we had the scramble eggs and fresh juice they were great
4
Great coffee and the eggs Benedict was devine. Only 10 minutes from Raffles City - certainly worth a try.
4
Popped in for a coffee and was greeted with friendly staff. The cafe itself is on the side of the river and has a laid back vibe, the coffee was excellent!
4
EIther sunny or rainy day, Toby's Estate will always be a nice place to hang out with friends for breakfast/brunch over freshly brewed coffee. The daylight or spattering of raindrops against the windows are very soothing.
3
My soy cappuccino was perfect just like what i had in oz but service was poor. Staff was not very friendly. The cafe was located along the river in robertson quay. Love the morning ambience with lots of joggers and dog walkers passing bu. Perfect for breakfast or brunch.
4
I was craving some good ol' aussie breakky and I found it right in Singapore.Since I am a fan of Toby's estate coffee from living in Australia I was excited to find it in robertson Quay. The quality and the service was great. One thing that didn't meet my expectation was the bread, Australia has great sour dough and this one here didn't meet my 'greatness' of sourdough levels
1
Toby's estate coffee shop at Robinson walk.I'd like to say my eggs and bacon were perfect, but as they never arrived it's difficult to say. I watched ( and tasted my wife's, which were good. 7.5/10). I mentioned the lack of my meal to the young waitress who disappeared inside never to return. 15 minutes later nothing had appeared so I called a more mature waitress over expecting a professional response but she too disappeared. So after 45 minutes we gave up. When paying the bill they didn't bother taking the coffee price off the bill.This is typical Singapore service, staff are young, inexperienced at dealing with any minor deviation from the norm.I nice sunny morning spooky. Off for hawker noodle
4
Tucked behind our hotel on Havelock Road (Four Points) is a pedestrian bridge that crosses to the other river. Plenty of restaurants lined up the waterfront and Toby's Estate is one of them. A great to have breakfast or brunch over the weekend while looking over the view and Toby's Estate serve the usual cafe fare: coffee, burgers and the likes. I like the chill atmosphere and it's a pretty nice place to hang out.
4
Walking along the river noticed Toby's. Went in just for an affogato but did look at the menu which looked good.
Service was fast even considering they were quite busy.
Anyone who likes their Aussie stores I'm sure will enjoy this.
4
This is my favourite place during the weekend. A great location along the river, lots of sun, great coffee & decent breakfast.
3
Popped in here this weekend to try the coffee and a roast beef sandwich. The coffee was great, but the roast beef was a bit chewy for my liking and I don't think I'd have it again. Very popular place on weekends.
2
This morning, I had the Brekkie, my hubby the Beef sandwich and my son the pulled pork burger and a coffee each.
The food here is totally mediocre and overrated. Not worth the bill of $84! You can get much better food elsewhere!
2
Had eggs Benedict w stewed beef. Poached eggs were over done. Chronically as both mine and wife's were. As were the ones at the next table. Stewed beef was bland. Brioche bread tasteless.
2
Used to come here for most of our weekend brunch and coffee before they renovated.And I just left the cafe 5 mins ago with great disappointment! $21.85 for the egg, mushroom, croissant and mocha. Price ok for the location but the Croissant is the worst I have ever eaten in the past years. Soggy inside probably due to not baking well or just very cheap quality.With the increasing competitive cafe scene especially in neighbourhoods, I don't think Toby can survive any longer with such deteriorating standard...I for sure will not be back again... Farewell
2
Now I know that Toby's Estate is not Robinson Crusoe when it comes to delivering meals to guests in a staggered fashion. But, guys, the whole idea of dining together is that you eat at the same time. On our most recent visit one of us had finished our meal before the other was served. And we are talking brunch here, not a cordon bleu creation. The manager on duty did cut us some slack on the bill which was decent. But I'd rather have paid full freight and enjoyed the experience
3
I regularly come to Toby's, largely because it's a great spot to break up a long walk with a decent cup of coffee. Lately service has been slipping and things take forever generally with orders being forgotten and payments taking a while. The coffee used to be its main selling point but the quality has really dropped since the beginning of the year with most of the coffees being fairly bitter compared to how they used to be. The burgers are excellent, poached eggs overly vinegary and the place is quite understaffed especially on weekends. Great location but service needs to improve
3
This place used to be great, not sure what has happened. Coffee is 3 out of 5 times bitter and horrible, service is awful and slow and you have to ask numerous times for everything. Food is all average, the most vinegary poached eggs I've ever had and toast that is not toasted properly. Quite common for orders to be entirely forgotten about and never delivered. I know good coffee is hard to find in Singapore and that's why I put up with all the negatives of this establishment, but with the coffee also being hit and miss here these days, I don't know if I'll be coming back as regularly. A real shame as the place used to be really nice!
4
we went for our evening cup of coffee and had an ice cappuccino, ice cafe mocha and hot cafe mocha with skimmed milk. We also had a slice of earl grey cake.The coffee was strong and flavoursome and the cake slice was a perfect match for our coffee. Wud recommend this place only if you a coffee fan else u maybe disappointed.Avg cost per coffee SGD 9 per hea
4
Went to try their chicken burger. It was nice and juicy. Their colourful fries is interesting and tasty too. Nice combination with the chipotle sauce.
3
Walked here for a takeaway cappuccino. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. The cafe was quite busy this Sunday morning with everyone having breakfast.
Coffee was average. I've had better... and worse.
4
Chanced across this cafe on a lazy weekend. Interesting and tasty rainbow fries. Opening hours are until evening, so not a dinner place.
5
Stopped by for a quick snack and coffee. Very helpful staff. Typical Australian type place with decent coffee right by the river.
2
Used to be one of my favorite brunch places but the food quality has steadily declined over the last 2-3 years and with the revolving doors of service staff, service is now rude and curt. Servers seem to hound customers out of the door and more intent in banging utensils as hard and loud as possible. One to forget and move on
5
With the Entertainer App, you get 1 for 1 mains which are super value for money. We took a Trip down to Toby's Estate on Saturday for brunch and ordered the duck salad, a couple of burgers and an eggs Benny Rodyk style. Food was overall quite good but the highlight was the coffee. The cold brews, according to my friends who had them, were amazing and the flat white I had was delicious.The service staff were polite and the ambience was relaxed, just perfect for a Saturday brunch outing.Can't wait to come back for more
4
Toby's estate is facing Singapore river with green view. It has the industrial deco look. Good place to have a cup of coffee or snack. There is various types of tea and coffee for you to choose . The food option is relatively limited. Mainly is breakfast , sandwich and burger . The salad taste is ok and quite healthy, but the portion is small. Each dish cost average 20-20dollars. You pay more for the relaxing atmosphere other than the food itself. Maybe you can just consider to have morning or afternoon coffee here. Not your main meal.
5
We visited this place on the weekend at Robertson Quay branch. The service was quite attentive. The rainbow fries with Honey mustard was just Excellent. Mixed 3 types of yellow, purple and orange potatoes was super tasty and crispy. Dipping should put one table spoon more though. Flat White and Piccolo Latte was perfectly made in the right temperature and right amount of mixer. The medium roasted coffee beans gave a lot of nice aroma, acidity, body and aftertaste.
1
When you know that you are popular place on weekends you should know how you manage the rush. The staff was clueless, rude and even saying we are busy. In fact I saw the guests being more relaxed then I can't imagine why the staff acted like the world was crumbling around them. Seriously!!! They took 30 mins to even get our bill. We had to remind twice. Very disappointed. Will never come back.
4
Visited on a weekday fancying some caffeine with a delicious brunch in a relaxing atmosphere. Nestled along the quiet shores of Singapore river in Robertson Quay area, this is surely a serene place away from the hustle-and-bustle of the nearby ChinaTown and Clarke Quay, perfect for an afternoon or evening meal.Sticking to my brunch theme, I ordered from the all day breakfast menu, but one can also order lunch meals from the lunch and salad sections. I ordered a Rodyk Style Eggs Benedict which is Brioche topped with poached eggs, cured salmon slices and sauce with salad on the side. I must I wasn't disappointed at all. Every component of the dish was of good quality and it tasted fantastic. I had a Mocha Chai to go with it which was okay, nothing too great about that. I must say that my server was really nice. I first seated myself outside but later decided to move inside as it was too hot for me and the server was happy to bear with my vacillations. She continued to serve me with a smile and helped me through the menu.Overall, it was a good experience with good food and good hospitality. I would love to visit again when I am craving river-side brunch
5
The location of this place is great. Right at the water.
The food is good and their coffees are great.
Nice place to wake up at with a cup of coffee
4
All day breakfast is great, a little pricey for eggs benedict but that's what the entertainer is for. Coffee is good. Air-conditioning is poor, it got quite warm.
5
Perfect brunch setting by the river. Food excellent. Service spot on. Good value for money. Recommend the breakie of champions. Listed on the Entertainer app.
2
Went here for breakfast, below average food, insipid bacon,average service but still priced with the rest of Singapore.
Find somewhere else
4
Yummy food, we ordered seoul burger and wolly egg benedicts. Gibraltar is good too. Location is by the river but it is ideal if you drive or carry an umbrella on a rainy day.
5
We visited Toby's Estate last time we were in Singapore, this visit we went there 3 times in 8 days, we knew what to expect this time, the maple bacon will not be to everyone's taste, my partner hated it last time, this time could not get enough of it, it's very crispy and cooked in maple syrup so will not please some people, and again don't forget to get your eggs flipped as will be raw on top if fried, I had the Hero's breakfast on the first day and struggled to eat it, so just bacon and eggs for me after that.The service was better this year, not brilliant but it is Singapore so as long as it's efficient it is good, the young lady we had on our first visit this time was the best service we had there. I said to my partner that you know this is a good place as all the other places near by were empty while each time we went to Toby's it was busy.The inside looked nice, but I prefer to sit outside, they have fans to keep cool.We will be going back again if we are lucky enough to get back to Singapore next yea
5
This cafe has a good location along the river near Robertson Quay. It's not too hard to find. It's such a gem of a place that I would be visiting more often in future. Food's tasty and the brioche tasted like heaven. The coffee is very good. Definitely a must try in Singapore

I found this great cafe on a walk along the river just near Robertson Quay.Toby's Estate Cafe has a great location overlooking the river on a pleaseant walking cycleway beside the river. The coffee is the best I had in Singapore and the cafe has a great menu from good breakfast choices through to home baked cakes and lunch menu.The Cafe has a good vibe with nice tunes and friendly staff. Robert, one of the staff at the cafe really looked after the customers and looked after everyone like they were a special guest.If you're looking for great food and coffee and a nice place to chill from the heat in Singapore, this is the place

Visited Toby's for coffee for the first time and came away satisfied. The location is top notch, being right on the river...they have a decent covered outdoor space to sit (with fans) and is a good place to people watch along the quay.The coffee selection (type, preparation, etc.) was quite good. I ended up selecting a flat white, which was not bad, but could have been a bit stronger.I'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu items, especially given the great location

This is a pleasant enough establishment that serves a range of meals throughout the day. The food is presented well and is tasty and reasonable value for money. Unfortunately, like the majority of restaurants and coffee places, service is substandard and detracts from the visit. Toby's Estate is no exception and from my experience is, among the worst. It is a pity that a good food venue can suffer from poor service staff.
4
Good food. Ample selection but what is outstanding is the location- right by the river. Kids running around, people cycling - nice. Food was enjoyable, nothing special but pretty good. Service was good. Would I go back- yes.
4
Great service with great food! Tried the Tobias Burger and it was delicious. The brekkie for champions was awesome too!
4
It was Christmas day when we visited the place.
Table service was good despite of the crowd. We never felt neglected :)
It was a good experience for me and friends.
4
This place next to Singapore river is my favorite for several years. Relaxing athmosphere, good breakfast and cool drinks.. Staff is really friendly and ready to serve when ever you need something. Nice location near Robertson Quay and the Quay. Warmly recommended.
5
This place knows how to serve coffe. The bread is very good. Beautifully situated by the river. Interiour decoration is very urban (the good, cool way). Fast wifi.

- situated by the riverside, conducive for a long weekend hangout with friends and family
- nice brunch place, several interesting breakfasts on the menu
- try the home brew.
- casual, convivial atmosphere; service is friendly.

I went here for breakfast with my husband this morning and could not be more disappointed. I went a few years ago and remembered it being better than what I experienced this morning. I ordered the poached eggs on sourdough - a simple dish that should be easy to get right.... Well, it was awful - the eggs were not properly cooked and completely tasteless. I am a huge fan of sourdough bread and the one they serve at toby's estate has to be the worst I have had. My husband ordered the full breakfast and it looked awful and according to my husband it tasted really bad too. The hot chocolate I ordered tasted so bad too - I was honestly shocked at how bad it was. My husband had to cancel his drink order, as it arrived after we had finished eating. I have to say this was one of me worst dining experiences - I had to warn others. Absolutely terrible - cannot believe the prices they charge for the quality of the food and overall experience
4
Good coffee place. But crowded on weekends. The coffee is fragrant, fried mushroom on the menu is extremely huge and juicy which we love. And its a huge serving for 2. The location may not be that accessible, however, its a good place to chill and chit chat on a bright sunny day
3
Toby's Estate is located along the river at Robertson Quay, surrounded by large trees, overlooking the bum oats passing by and all the families walking by or skate boarding. The lattes are amazing, a piece of art and I love the casual ambiance! I once got a latte with my face on top.
5
Definitely one for the coffee snobs. We found this unusual coffee shop on the Singapore River very close to our hotel (RIverview). Great selection of coffee and care taken in preparation produces a good experience for those who love their coffee. All-day breakfast selections are generous
4
First time here, recommend by one of my friend. I love the setting of this cafe, nice ambience. Nice latte , I order Toby's french toast, the bread is very good. All loves the bread
Wolly Style also good
4
2nd time here. Nice atmosphere with pretty good food, coffee & friendly service, grab a seat by window for view of river while you chill over a book and a cuppa coffee, or a seat outdoor for a lovely brunch with friends
5
Really good coffee served inside or out under the fans. Cold water given as you arrive (for the dogs too!). Great stop for dog walkers, runners and cyclists. Good breakfast options - had the French toast
4
Enjoyed the "brekky of champions" with a flat white. Breakfast consisted of eggs, tomatoes, maple espresso bacon, sausage, beans, mushrooms, and toast. Nice location by the river. Service was very good. Dog friendly patio area.
5
We went out of our way to visit and it was sooooo worth it. We had been struggling with coffee during our stay in singapore (despite Starbucks being on every other corner :/) and finding this place was heavenly! The coffee was great and the kids loved the iced chocolates. Lovely location and venue too. Perfect for a stroll along Robertson quay afterwards before lunch also by the river at Clarke quay. Made for a wonderful morning
4
Our second visit, previously for dinner. This time for brunch. Pleasant atmosphere, good staff, good coffee and the French Toast, bacon and berry brunch is delicious. Different blends of coffee served on different days. Good for people watching and the river activities as they pass by
3
First things first they do good coffee. There is nothing wrong with this cafe, and plenty of locals love it for the relaxed atmosphere. Service can be hard to get though; and the menu is basic. There's nothing wrong with popping in here for a coffee - but if you're visiting from out of town only for a short visit, I'd recommend getting a take away coffee here and strolling along the river for some other nicer options around
3
Grew up in Sydney, my first encounters with coffee were mostly at Toby's Estate Potts Point. So being back in Asia, I definitely miss it from time to time. So whenever I'm in Singapore, I always try to visit Toby's Estate and be reminded why did I fell in love with coffee the first time.Overall coffee is good, food is decent (somehow I feel like it could be better), but oh well, after all it's still Toby's
3
This place has a stunning location along the riverwalk. Really a pleasure to walk into -- but I'm afraid the value just isn't there. I was craving coffee (been more than 2 months on the road without a proper cup), and I was glad to see that they do Chemex. $6 for a cup...ok, I'll bite and pay New York prices. But the coffee really wasn't great. It tasted overextracted and watery, and when served in a little 8 oz cup left me feeling pretty disappointed.I paid another $5 for sourdough toast thinking that it might be something really special, but it was just 2 massive slices of hot and dry bread, accompanied by a very small pat of butter and some tasteless strawberry jelly. Whoosh. However, I managed to hang out and enjoy the location for quite a while. Their customer service is great. Their wifi is abysmal -- don't come here if you need a fast connection. Tried to skype a colleague and just gave up. I saw some people getting some meals that looked relatively tasty, even though they cost north of $20. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. However, coffee and toast should be the easiest things to master. Would have been happy with what I paid if it had been tasty, but overall I walked away feeling rather silly to have paid $11 for dry bread and coffee
2
I'm a big fans of breakfast with a good coffee. I had a big hope before coming here to have special breakfast with good coffee. But. There's nothing special with the breakfast. It just scrambled egg with lots of butter. And they cant make omelette for you. Coffee? Not my favourite as there are lots of other cafe that offers better coffee. The barista makes my mocha too sweet, or maybe he used half bottle of chocolate for my coffee. So if you want a good breakfast with good coffee. Find somewhere els
4
Had two smashing lattes when you want good coffee and the Seoul burger which is a twist on Korean pork which was soo good. Loved it.
4
Nice but expensive breakfast place in the heart of the expat stronghold of Rivervalley. Food was good, but not as good as it was hyped on the web. Great service but inflated Singapore prices. Coffees are coming in kids size.
3
Ate lunch here and the service was average, food is just so so. There are so many other options, I wouldn't choose to go here again.
4
This is my favorite weekend brunch joint. The specialty coffee is of high standard. Either hand drip or cold brew. Egg Benedict Brooklyn style is the frequent choice. For weekend, try not to get in at lunch time. Too much crowd here.
5
Plain and simple. Must visit for coffee and French toast. Delicious!!! J&J
No need for 100 characters to review this place, it's great. Great food, atmosphere and staff.
5
What can I say perfect for breakfast. Friendly helpful staff. Good location.Great Food. I had the full breakfast amazing, my companions had the French toast equally as good. Very busy which must say something . Go there!
5
Toby's is still my favorite coffee of all time. There is something about their roast that is just special. It is a mixture of sweet and fruity which chocolate overtones.It is a great place to have a quick light snack or read a book,I keep going back
5
If you are near the Singapore River take the time to follow it upstream to Toby's Estate if you need a coffee and want to unwind. My wife and I were staying across the River at the Riverview Hotel. The hotel was carrying out renovations during our stay. So there was no easy way of getting a coffee to start the day. Toby's offers possibly the closest coffee to what you would find in a good Italian style cafÃ© in Australia. The staff are warm friendly and efficient making everyone feel welcome. Although I did not eat there the food looks great
2
I live near the area so I have been to Toby's Estate a few times now. The coffee is excellent. Living off the successes of the Australia location. But this particular outlet is TERRIBLE. Why you ask?We have come here several times and the service - if you do not get the Filipino staff is like lost children that have been left in the middle of no where and looking for a way out. Glazed and confused. The Filipino guys are great - but don't order from anyone remotely local. Sorry. Asking for water was like speaking in a foreign language. And we actually did ask in 2 different languages. We ordered the breakfast of champions and the pancakes. Firstly, "Breakfast of Champions" was pathetic. At $26 it should be sizable the sausage came out and it was literally a sausage that they cut in half. CHEEKY. Uhm who cuts a sausage in half and serves it? Way to cut costs without being obvious. - They did give us the other half later when we asked what happened to the other half of the sausage. The pancakes.Service was extremely poor. Sometimes I just want to go shoot myself when I am here. Epicurious & Soi 60 own the street is a far better deal. The staff are so pleasant, the price point excellent. Coffee is not as excellent at Toby's. But maybe do a take away from Toby's and dine at Epicurious & Soi 60 instead
4
Toby's Estate at Robertson Quay in Singapore has been my favorite weekend breakfast place for almost 2 years.The breakfast menu has a great variety, the lattes are an art form and puts a smile on your face. The location along the river and the large trees makes it a wonderful urban experience. My favorite waiter is Robert
4
Had the chicken salad for lunch, it was absolutely beautiful. Staff was friendly and the service was excellent! Heard the breakfast and eggs benedict is superb, will definitely go back to try it!
4
Pretty little cafe serving great breakfast at the Robertson Quay.Very popular with locals and tourists.Absolutely value for money.
5
Came out for a late late breakfast. Ordered the woolly and wasn't disappointed. Amazing brioche and poached eggs with prosciutto. Went down in a matter of minutes. Will definitely be back
4
Love coming down to Toby's to prepare my travel itinerary, pop by during the weekday as the weekends will be very crowded and cramped. They served great coffee and breakfast. Not really a big fan of their breakfast however coffee is one of the best in my list
4
It was on the weekend I came here. Coffee was great, big portion of bfast plate, air conn, you can buy a bag of whole beans here as a gift or to bring home. On the weekend, mostly expatriates came here for bfast. They provide a smoking area, on the outside.
4
A great location for breakfast, sitting on the Singapore River and away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas. We had the Eggs Benedict, French Toast and the kids dabbled in the pancakes. Very much resembled the sort of dishes we get back home in Australia and at comparative pricing.. The 4 of us came in at $75 for breakfast, including coffees, cooked breakfasts, drinks etc. which is pretty much on par with my expectations.. All in all, great location, excellent customer service, very attentive and friendly and good food that kick started the day
4
Coffee is great. Breakfast menu was much more limited than I would have expected (came during the weekday morning). Scrambled eggs and brioche was ok, a little bit unsatisfying (half of a brioche, too much bland scrambled eggs). But service was really attentive and friendly, and the setting is great. Great for a morning read / study. Recommended
4
Thanks to the internet I was directed to this place the first morning that I was in Singapore to grab a spot of breakfast. Okay, it was directly across the river from my Hotel, so it wasn't all that hard to find (though I did walk around the block until I realised that it was on the waterfront). Like most places in Singapore they offer table service (which took me a bit to get used to) and it isn't the cheapest place for a meal (but then again this is Singapore) but they did make a pretty decent eggs benedict and their coffee wasn't bad either. The location is also quite peaceful, and their outdoor area is also undercover, which does help during the inclement weather. I did quite like the place, especially the peaceful surroundings, and the fact that it is away from the bustle of the city centre
5
My Singaporean friend recommend me to this place for coffee. There are a few single origin coffee choices and cold brew coffee. Brunch is a surprise - I've had the best french toast ever here. The bread is thick and very soft. Now I know why this is the restaurant with full house in Robinson Quay (while others are nearly empty at lunch time)
4
Toby's estate is famous for their coffee. I had a latte, I personally think it tastes quite diluted. But they have an interesting maki roll on their menu worth trying. It is a maki roll with enoki mushrooms with mint leaves wrapped with bacon and fried with crispy batter. There was a tangy sauce that paired well with its garnish of onion, cucumber and carrots
1
Fries are not good, too dry. The meat of the burger has a very bad taste, is very hard and too cooked. To avoid absolutely please
5
Super friendly staff who made an awesome babycino for my son.
Terrific coffee. A little piece of Australia in Singapore. For Aussies hanging out for a decent coffee head down here.
5
Great espresso, good breakfast. Friendly staff. Lovely place along the Singapore River. Roaster inside the café.
4
This place serves a great cup of coffee. In addition, I ordered the scramble eggs on toast and it was excellent. Lightly toasted bread, and perfectly seasoned scrambled eggs. The location is right on the river and the staff was very nice.
5
This place is absolutely worth a visit. The food is gorgeous (breakfast) generous servings and very good quality worth every cent.The coffee is sublime and absolutely love their slow brew coffees - definitely worth the wait if you enjoy REALLY GOOD COFFEE.Great service - A busy busy place- but you can reserve a table if you don't want to wait. The staff are expert at finding free tables/sitting places when they come free. There is always the bar to sit at and watch the slow brew coffee process - Toby Estate is highly recommended by me and a must go to if you're looking for somewhere casual and easy with good value for money
4
Toby's estate was close to my nieces apartment and looked like a nice place for breakfast along the river,We mostly enjoyed our breakfast and coffees, I had Bacon and Eggs, the bacon seemed to be cooked in syrup and I didn't mind it but my partner wouldn't eat it.the eggs as I found if you don't ask for them to be flipped the yoke will be undercooked.We didn't go inside as there was a gentleman outside who took our order and at the end gave us the bill.The service was as you expect in Singapore it got better later on, but it took a while to get his attention when it was time to leave
1
We went there on a Saturday and we had to wait for 2 hours for our 3 burgers!While everyone was getting their meals ( people coming after us got served first) the main issue of this place is the management and service. Maybe they can have somebody to teach them how to deal with a restaurant? Shame because the place is nice! Don't go there if you are hungry
3
We live close by and visited Toby's for Sunday brunch. The ambiance was good -friendly with many families relaxed for Sunday brunch in outdoor setting. Service was generally good and attentive. We loved the coffee (my wife had a second round) and good go back for coffee. However, breakfast was disappointing. The salad was old and limp the food was average and overpriced.My recommendation is to stay with their coffee
3
I love a good cup of coffee and Toby's Estate had the best coffee that I had during my recent trip to Singapore. I however found the food overpriced and not to my liking. With none of my family finishing their meals.Nice location and good service
5
This has fast become a favorite weekend stop for us as it serves up great coffee. Its quite refreshing to see ALWAYS happy staff and staff that actually enjoy and are passionate about their job. The staff are accommodating with our little one and go out of there way to make us feel welcome. The breakfast selection is great and offers something for everyone
4
Came here with my friends for a big breakfast, nice place, nice ambiance, the food is also delicioussss
5
We were staying over the other side of the river but came here for breakfast every day. We are fussy coffee drinkers and this was great. Try the French toast- delicious.
4
We enjoyed a nice breakfast. Located a bit off the beaten track. 13.00 and we were still able to have breakfast outside. Very relaxed.
5
Their Gibraltar Latte and croissant are just pure perfection! The place in general and the service is also great.
4
Quite a limited lunchtime menu
very tasty food, average size portions
no problems would eat here again
4
We dined here recently on a rainy Sunday morning. The outdoor dining area was closed due to the morning shower but I bet it would be a great view as the outdoor seats were over-looking the Singapore river. The restaurant was pretty packed but the waiters were swift in handing out menus and serving food. We ordered Toby's granola, scrambled eggs with sautÃ©ed mushrooms, roasted cherry tomatoes and butter toasted brioche. For drinks we ordered pineapple ginger drink, piccolo latte and cappuccino. The scrambled egg was creamy and fluffy. Portions were large and filling. The juice was fresh and the coffees were awesome. Overall, the food was nice and reasonably priced, service was prompt
4
I came here from Liang Court specifically for coffee and croissant (from outsourced baker) but as it was about 4pm they no longer had croissants. I opted for a mocha and took advantage of their wifi. I stayed indoors for the AC but there are nice outside tables with awning and a breeze from the water. The mocha was good probably one of the better ones I've had in Singapore. I don't find the coffee in Singapore all that good and yes, I've been to all the little specialty coffee shops - sorry, they're not all that great! The mocha here was decent, not the best I've had but acceptable. It seems like a nice spot for a coffee break. It's walking distance from Clarke Quay MRT stop alongside the water. I wouldn't come here specifically for the coffee, but if you are in the area, drop in. They close at 6pm and were taking last calls for drinks at 5pm
4
We went to this cafe on 2 separate occasions, having coffee and French Toast. A good standard. Pleasant to either sit in with air conditioning or outside under umbrellas (for sun or rain) watching the boats go by on the river. The place has a relaxed contemporary vibe
1
We went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and we fully regret every second of this encounter.The place has terrible service - there are lots of waiters all running around, but they are poorly trained and the place is not managed properly.We waited for an hour for our breakfast to be served - all the time being told that it would be out in '2 minutes'. Also, the tea was pathetic - I ordered english breakfast tea, and it was like dishwater. They didn't offer me milk - and when I asked, they eventually brought steamed latte milk. A joke for over $7 a pot.The owners of this place need to invest some time here in improving the management and service
2
Only been there on Saturday mornings (busy). The coffees are good and so are the coffee beans for home use. Unfortunately the service is very slow - lot's of mistakes with the orders, not only us but also the people around us. For breakfast, they've taken pancakes off the menu. They were out of some of the breakfast ingredients this morning. Slow to process the bill. Uncomfortable outside tables and chairs that are too close together
3
I would have rated this place 4 out of 5 stars. Busy little place on Robertson Quay requiring more staff. If your looking for good western food and/or coffee don't let that put you off. Find a table and flat down the waiter.
5
After 3 years of living in South East Asia and yet to return to Sydney, it was a wonderful surprise to be able to sit down and enjoy a Toby's Estate Coffee. I didn't get any food but it did look amazing.
1
Horrible service. Never have I waited this long for coffee. Not only did it take them 25 mins to bring out the coffee, they also brought the coffee out one by one. Unbelievable. I would give it no 0/5 bubble rating if I could.
4
This is a great riverside location and delicious food, especially breakfast/brunch. Try the French toast brioche with fresh fruit, maple syrup and spices, and crisp bacon on the side - yummy !
2
This used to be one of my favorite coffee and weekend brunch place in Singapore but things have dramatically changed in the last few months. As a matter of fact I was raving about it in a previous review that I made last year. But sadly after a "kitchen renovation" prices went up, service became bad and disorganized , the food quality went down, coffee takes forever to arrive and is cold....I really hope they are gonna do something about it and until then it will be off my list
3
Coffee was great and so was the hot chocolate. The breakfast menu had quite a few items and we enjoyed our breakfast. But we found the portions to be small for the price paid. Ambience was conversation-friendly and the interiors are done up well. Service was surprisingly good. Cool location off the Robertson Quay waterfront. Per person cost was about S$35 for breakfast and two coffees
2
Went for breakfast with family last Saturday. Was amazed how bad service can be. Utterly disorganised - they insisted we didn't need a table number. They gave my girlfriends Mum the breakfast for the people next to us. I was then given a meal without Chorizo, only to find I had been served someone else's breakfast also. My girlfriends Dad was given the wrong bread. Each meal was served and eaten individually and the coffees came out last. Simple breakfast took two hours to complete with multiple staff apologies. Staff understood service was poor but it needs some significant management intervention to resolve. Reeks of a poorly managed restaurant. Food was average, coffee was terrific. Overall experience ruined by mixed up orders and poor service
1
Have been a loyal customer since the opening and almost two years. Key attractions were the excellent coffee and a contained but honest breakfast/casual menu.Over the last few months standards truly collapsed with appalling waiting time (20 mins for a coffee) and cold, uninspired food.Not sure what happened, I reckon simply a change of management for the worst.Strike off the list..
3
Love going there on the weekends, food is always good. But the service recently is diabolical. Food is served in stages, so someone always lands up eating alone, drinks take forever (even when they not busy), waiters seem frazzled (even when they not busy). It's a real shame as the food is really good.
4
Sitting outside by the river at Robertson's quay, we had a relaxing and enjoyable breakfast. We were there early on a weekday and it was fairly quiet and the service was quick and friendly. Cooked breakfasts are of a very generous portion. Coffee is excellent with the most amazing coffee art with the milk. A great start to the day
5
This was really a pleasent surprise, we had an amazing breakfast, very good Coffe and very nice service, a plus for this restaurant is Mr Toby, a very good host!!!!!
4
Had brunch and coffee here after a long walk around Marina Bay. Great coffee and tasty food - Moroccan Baked Eggs were excellent.
5
Great coffee and great food for breakfast. There seems to be a tendency in Singapore to serve lukewarm coffee, but when I asked for it to be hotter my coffee was remade and was lovely.
Space is very nice and beans are roasted on site!
3
The coffee was nice but the prices were WAY to expensive for breakfast. I was really hungry when I went but I was taken aback with the price of $25 for a larger breakfast and ordered poached eggs on toast for around $10. The 2 eggs were poached nicely however there was only one small piece of toast so I left still hungry. The cafÃ© is right on the riverbank and does have a lovely aspect to enjoy your coffee
3
Went to Toby's Estate today for breakfast / brunch. Great location, and smiling service. Sat outside and enjoyed the ambiance.Ordered coffee and food. The eggs arrived very quickly. They were cold. Spoke to the waitress and she went away to try again. In the mean time the coffee arrived and was excellent. The second attempt at the eggs came almost at the same time. They were cold.Spoke to the waitress and really emphasized that it would be expected to have the eggs with some heat !!!...Away she went to return 5 minutes later with another set of eggs.....yes you guessed it ......cold.Meanwhile the second diner did have a reasonable cold beetroot salad.Summary - If you want anything to do with food that is not created at the start of the day, and then served on demand cold maybe you should try one the other cafes enjoying the same location and ambiance.The waitress was courteous but really had no impact on whoever was the chef today
1
I used to frequent Toby's Estate on weekends for breakfast along with a few other restaurants in the Robertson Quay area. The place has recently been under renovation and just reopened.This Sunday, I thought I would give it a try again. Terrible service and I just walked out in the middle of the order. I asked for an egg white breakfast and crispy bacon. The server told me that egg white would be extra if the chef allows. And that their new policy is that there should be no changes to the menu. Basically, that I should accept what the chef servers me.I decided to take my business to Boomerang down the river which is customer oriented and make your breakfast to order just how you want it with a smile.Give Toby's a miss and walk down to Boomerang if looking for western breakfast in Robertson Quay area. Doubt Toby's can survive with this attitude

We recently had a Sunday family brunch at this lovely riverside restaurant. Even though there was a line up, we decided the wait for an outside spot was worth it. We were placed at the outer bar table. We promptly ordered our food, the process seemed painless at the time. But sure enough our mains arrived before juice or coffee, the servers did not offer water, and one of our order was probably never put through. Everyone at the table was fed at different times, our lost order arrived 30 mins later, way over cooked. It was mayhem. No one was owning up to the fact that the order of food was forgotten. They insisted it is a dish that takes extraordinarily long. So what I would suggest is, please give the customer a fair warning, right? One guy watched the five of us wolf down our breakfast...not nice at all...we fed him bits and bites.... There was no manager on duty. We were told he is not there by one, there is an acting manager for now, the post is vacant by another staff. Hmmm...after much huffufle we asked for our bill. There was a sincere apology and an effort to retain us as customers in future. How disappointing to start a leisurely Sunday on the river.Food quality was fair. I had the eggs Benedict, eggs cooked slightly too done for me, not much runny yolk. The ham was Parma, which was nice. I chose sourdough bread, but I think it was not sourdough, just an ordinary burger bun as I couldn't taste sourdough quality. My ice free orange juice was good, as well as the latte. When we did get our water, it was fine, tap. I cannot really comment on the other food, it was shared with the patron who waited 30 mins and ended up leaving on an empty stomach :
5
I went here to do some work on a Sunday morning with some breakfast. I got a spot that was bar-style seating facing outside so I could see the patio and the water. Meal was good, simple brunch food and good coffee as well. Free wifi was fast, especially considering that it was pretty crowded (not that I saw that many people using the internet, but you never know). Ambiance was great, and I easily spent over 2 hours there
5
It was a cloudy and lazy Saturday afternoon and my wife and I decided to head to Toby's for a leisure brunch.When we arrived, it seemed that a number of folks had the same idea as well. But to our surprise, it took us no more than 10 minutes to be seated inside the cavernous hall replete with long communal table, exposed brick walls, large chalkboard behind the counter and of course, the industrial-size in-house roaster sitting majestically in one corner.The missus ordered the Toby's Breakfast (barn laid eggs scrambled with maple pork bacon, roasted cherry tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms and brioche toast) and a pot of Refresh tea; while I had the Moroccan Baked Eggs (with spices, chilli con carne, chorizo, bacon, kidney beans, mushrooms and buttered toast) and the Gibraltar Latte.Both dishes were delicious and deceivingly filling, and actually good value for money. For those who like their coffee robust and strong, the Gibraltar Latte definitely hits the spot!It was a wonderful experience indeed. Shame about the flies inside though. They were a tad annoying, truth be told. I suppose it does lend a true Aussie Summer experience to the mix! Now where did I leave my bush tucker hat
5
Toby's estate was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel and we went there a number of times for breakfast. The scrambled eggs with brioche is first class. My wife had the muesli and I had the granola, no complaints there. All the items are reasonable priced. The premises itself is great as one of the mornings we had breakfast there, they were roasting coffee beans and the smell was amazing. I would recommend breakfast at Toby's Estate
3
Great coffee and cafe food. Just like Sydney! ! Strong expat contingent with relaxed friendly vibe. Reasonable value for quality food in Robertson Quay area if you are after a good coffee & change from hotel buffets.
4
very good place, i go there several times a month for breakfast or brunch as it is in my area. i love the service, the food is good as well as the coffee. pleasant place and location with wifi access.
A good spot!
3
My son who lives in Singapore loves this place but i was disappointed. The music was dreadful and the coffee luke warm. However there was a young crowd who seemed to enjoy it
5
Lovely place for a leisurely breakfast and great coffee with the papers. Perfect every time.
Bonus is watching the people of the city on their morning walks and runs.
5
Nice location. Excellent coffee! Also nice location for breakfast. What more do I have to tell. Apparantly a bit more. I have to have 100 characters for some reason.
5
My husband is very fussy about his coffee and this place saved the day. We were staying across the other side of the river at a disappointing hotel and so ate breakfast here on three occasions and were very happy. Only on the last morning the music became annoying - we think they had a special F1 soundtrack
4
We parked ourselves on the suar wood long table looking out at the waterway. With the Sunday breeze, it was quite idyllic. No complaints about the breakfast spread. In fact the berry pancakes deserve a nod. The eggs were done well and they took in whatever special requests including dairy free preferences. The long black and latte were so good that thereafter we ordered affogatos. Recommended
4
This place is a little gem in Singapore. Most places are buzzing, giving you the impression life is going crazy fast.However by luck I found this cafe, along the river on Richardson Quay. Imagine a nice cafe, high ceiling, modern / industrial / simple decor.A nice terrace, and inside a few tables, a bar along the windows to sit on high chairs and enjoy coffee, and a communal table in the middle. That's were I enjoyed 2 hours of my time, drinking coffee, having a nice lunch, reading etc. Food is good, but not amazing, so go here for simple food and a coffee, not for michelin star food ;-)This is simply my kind of cafes, where time slows down, people are friendly, the coffee is good and I can easily relax

Perhaps a bad day for them. My fellow diner's dish came out way undercooked and was served much later than mine- so I had finished my meal by the time the (now overlooked) meal came out. In fairness they took it off the bill. Service felt a bit slow - we had to ask for cutlery after we received one meal and the order was taken incorrectly in two respects. Clearly it has a loyal following so I will put it down to bad luck. Coffee was very good.

This cafe serves great coffee and a good range of breakfast choices which I found could becustomised to suit my taste. They have morning newspapers and long spacious tables and benches all in a very international warehouse boho style. There are please views to the river and it's not too busy in the early AM

We went here for breakfast one morning and were given decent quality, good size portions at average prices for Singapore. Good option for breakfast especially if staying at a pricey hotel nearby without brekkie included.

Coffee one if the best I've had in Asia
Better then most Melbourne locales
Setting v nice and fit out good. Nice to have a chat with a barista who knows his stuff

Fantastic setting rain hail or shine with air conditioned comfort or outdoors seating with a strong fan and bamboo shade over looking the canal. Great coffee and choice of good food. Watch the world go by and reflect on our wonderful world

We have had coffee here a few times and are always impressed by the quality. The coffee is strong and the milk perfectly textured. We found it to be very reasonably priced too. The service we experienced was fine. A little slow, but if we wanted to call the waiter, we did so and he came immediately. We haven't yet eaten here, but plan to have breakfast on the weekend. If you are a coffee lover, we recommend you check it out, maybe avoid peak times if you are in a rush? We went at 9am on a weekday and it was only half full

I am so disappointed to have to write a second (negative) review of Toby's. I have been a loyal customer since I moved to Singapore because Toby's is just about the only place I can get a good cup of coffee.Over the past year, I have ignored the slow service - on several occasions I have been told that they can't make me the chimex style coffee because "they are too busy," even thought it's listed on the menu and I was willing to fork out $6 for about three sips of coffee.All that could be forgiven. But they took it to a whole new level yesterday when my husband and I went in for breakfast. We both ordered food and were told it would be a while before it'd be ready. We were prepared to wait. 15 minutes later, my husband's food arrived. When he was halfway finished, I asked a server to check on my dish. Another 15 minutes passed. I asked ANOTHER server to check on my food. My husband finished his meal. I asked a THIRD time for someone to check on my food. It never came. We asked for the bill.At this point, I was still okay and understood that someone must have lost my order. However, I lost it when the manager came out and told me I would still have to pay for the food "because it had already been prepared." She said she would pack it up for me and give me a DISCOUNT. Are you kidding me!? I asked THREE people to check on my food and clearly NO ONE did, and then they try to act like it's my fault that I don't want to pay for a breakfast I never got?Note to the owner: you need to do a serious overhaul of the servers in your restaurant. You are losing money because of your wait staff. Sadly, I will not be back to Toby's. I just can't support a restaurant that treats its regular customers like they are in the wrong when the servers make a mistake - no matter how good the coffee is

The coffee is excellent, but like the previous reviewer mention the service is slow. Also I didn't care much for sitting elbow to elbow with other customers. They have quite a limited seating and the place has an unfinished feel to it. Although that look can work if done well, if your not careful it looks... Well, unfinished. Again you come here for the coffee, it's so good I don't bother adding sugar. Food was so so.

Well coffee was fabulous and worth the wait. Inside is very similar to aussie cafes with a big shared wooden table (although was cluttered with prams!). I sat outside by the river which i think was nicer. As i said, excellent coffee, just takes a while.

After hunting for good coffee in Singapore the last couple of time I have been here, I think the search is over. Friendly staff and a good flavour reminiscent of the coffee we get in Sydney. And the barrista remembered my drink after a couple of visits. Worth the visit if you are missing Australian style coffee

I went here as I'd heard good things about the coffee and the beans there.The location is great; on the river at Robertson's Quay.The restaurant itself is well thought out, with some seating outside and a huge, long table in the middle, with some stool seats against the wall.Service is not good (on a Sunday anyway). It took some time to even get noticed and then another few minutes before my order was taken. I ordered a cappuccino and a water. The water arrived very fast but the cappuccino took way too long.However, when it arrived, it was fabulous. Clearly the barista knew what she was doing. Creamy, sweet, well flavoured and with some decent latte art as well.I will try it again, despite the service. Better luck next time

Was looking forward to having our brunch here after reading a few reviews. Could not have been more disappointed. Ordered the Toby's special for brunch (eggs, tomato compote, challah bread, mushrooms) and for three of us our food arrived on time. It took a good 30 minutes after the others were served for my meal to arrive at which point I was so angered by the whole ordeal my meal had better be good (and it wasn't). A disappointing experience to say the least

Toby's Estate is located in a fun part of town- Robertson Quay.
The cafe has a contemporary-rustic-shared-table feel.
The coffee itself was OK; i prefer the coffee at Oriole Roasters

Real coffee in Singapore with good breakfasts and a nice outlook. Good coffee - a hard find in Singapore.

A rare find in a city that is only recently beginning to appreciate good coffee. Toby's estate is one of Robertson Quay's gems!

Talented baristas that pulled me some great shots, made me a solid pour-over and sent me home with a bag of coffee to boot. The staff is passionate about coffee and were happy to talk shop. The location is in a nice quiet area near Robinson Quay along Singapore river. The cafe itself is beautiful, with plenty of seating and a great bar to perch at. They roast on site in the cafe, which only helps with the atmosphere. I didn't eat there but the food looked great. But I wasn't there for the food, only for coffee and was not disappointed

Stopped over in Singapore for a couple of days after travelling through Sri Lanka. Was stinging for a good coffee, this place gave it to me. First decent coffee in over two weeks. Great service, reasonably priced and the interior is decked out super well. Bit rustique. It's in a nice peaceful spot on the river too

Drinks are very good. I tried the latte and the freshly squeezed pineapple juice. Food is ok We tried the musli youth with fruit, the bacon and the peosciutto paninis and the cheesecake. Suits are a bit too sweet. The stuff of young guys is very kind and attemptive. I would strongly recommend a better ventilation system, cause when you get out you need to wash your clothes.

Toby's is a coffee lover's paradise. Green beans are roasted on premises, the roaster is located just to the right of the entrance doors. Piles of imported green bean burlap sacks are stacked against the wall and the entire shop has the irresistible aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans.I love ordering Toby's estate coffee that is served in a wine glass. You can pick the method of brewing depending on strength, and the brewing and serving method really brings out the flavor of the beans. The menu is great - one of the better cafe menus in Singapore. I crave the mac and cheese, a true comfort food. Toby's 3 cheese version, with toasted croutons is gooey and served scalding hot. Its a lot more expensive than a kopitiam, but a true temple to coffee religion. Try, try, try!

After being absolutely spoiled with coffee in Australia, we have struggled to find a decent equivalent in AsiaHaving a cup at Toby's really reminded us of the great espressos we had at Sydney, and we went back almost every day while there to get out fix!Breakfast is quite nice [not amazing], but coffee is certainly worth it. And we were sad to miss the tasting class

I've been on the prowl for a good cup of coffee for a while now, and I finally found one at Toby's Estate. Typically, "coffee" in Singapore is actually what Americans call espresso, which is far too strong for me to drink on a regular basis. Toby's has a nice selection of daily coffee brews. The intensity of each is listed on the menu to help you choose. A little tip: these coffees are served in a wine glass. If you're like me and are no real connoisseur, just ask them to bring it to you in a regular mug. The food was pretty good, too. I had a ham and cheese croissant served with a side salad. The croissant was huge. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice breakfast or afternoon coffee on the river

There are always a lot of people in Toby Estate than in the other restaurants a Robertson Quay. We were attracted by the food it served.Small outdoor place yet cozy. A good place to have a weekend gathering with friends by the river to spend a sunny afternoon.Food is great. Menu with lots of choices. I love the ham and cheese croissant so much. It's crispy, fresh with melting cheese. Eggs Benedict is great too. It's not easy to have poached eggs done properly and they can always serve good poached eggs with consistency. Loads of choices for drinks as well. Juice is served in big glass. Coffee is well made. I gives a good wrap up for the meal
