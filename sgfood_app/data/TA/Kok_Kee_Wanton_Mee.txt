Like the taste and texture of the mee, the magnificent wantan mee sauce, nicely done char siew, the flavour rich clear broth with the superb wantons! A popular place, a popular wanton mee order, people .just love it.

Ordered the large bowl ($5) but personally still find the portion like a regular bowl.
Noodles is smooth, and the meat was thinly sliced.
Parking would be by the roadside or at Hoa Nam Building.

A must try Singaporean Chinese style noodle in Lavender area. The wanton mee was superb, with good eating place atmosphere. Not too crowded and airy.

Kok Kee wanton Mee is in its own league! The sauce/ gravy is unique, unlike the typical ketchup -Chilli based or black soya sauce based type. The char Siew is lean ( the way I like it coz I m conscious of unnecessary fats). The wanton is tasty . Guarantee no msg! Very yummy! Be prepared to queue!

It is located two doors away from the now demolished Lavender Food Court in Hoa Nam Building. Parking is easy in Hoa Nam Building.The stall is less busy these days with shorter queue. However its opening hours can be erratic.The noodles are served without soy sauce. The sauce is a slightly sweet and flavoursome soup. It is best to order the large portion so you can enjoy more of the char siew and wanton. I prefer to taste the soupy sauce without chilli

Ordered the "big" portion (S$5.50), take away, in a plastic bag. When I ate the noodles about 20 minutes later, they were still relatively springy and not soggy. There were two wontons, ten thin char siew slices, 4 very short vegetable stubs. Comparing with other wonton noodles take away, the portion seemed too little for the price. And for the rest of the day, I was extremely thirsty.The noodles were cooked in batches and apportioned into "small" and "big". So expectations must be adjusted.Whilst there, I noticed the unfriendly tone and manner of the order taker cum packer towards customers. Perhaps it wasn't a good day that day

When I first tasted Kok Kee Wanton Mee a few years back, my opinion of it was it good but too little for the price. Today when I ate it again (with a more seasoned palate) I realized the magic is in the smooth noodle texture drizzling in their special sauce. Perhaps they now served in a bowl, hence the noodle is well soaked in the sauce vs on a plate. The wantons are quite delicious. The wanton mee are priced at S$4.50 (small) and S$5.50 (big). Pls go for the big order because even so it is only a small bowl...teasing your appetite. Perhaps the special noodle is too precious! But it's ok, there are several cafes in that neighbourhood where you can go for a nice coffee and dessert !!

This stall has got the best wanton mee among all the supposedly famous ones like Fei Fei, Dunman hawker centre. It has the best taste among all. The wanton here is also tasty as the skin is thin and not those thick ones. Noodles are served with generous amount of sauce which tastes great with the noodles. Be sure to order the dry ones instead of the soup ones

Been eating Kok Kee Wonton Mee for the last few years and it is always very nice. After the noodles are cooked (in batches), yummy stock is added. There used to be long queues when they were at Lavender Food Square. Now they have moved to Lavender Food Hub @ Hoa Nam Building, the queues are shorter. This is one of the "to-eat" items when friends visit from overseas. Going overseas and know you will crave this wonton mee? Or plain o lazy to visit them everyday? No problem. Buy a few packets of noodles and deep freeze it. Steam it when you want to eat it. It still tastes totally awesome

I love this Wanton Mee, definitely among the best in Singapore. I know people who absolutely didn't like it, so taste is subjective and I won't claim this to be a must try. It's a little expensive as it costs $4.50 for a small portion, still cheaper than cafe or restaurant food right? :)
