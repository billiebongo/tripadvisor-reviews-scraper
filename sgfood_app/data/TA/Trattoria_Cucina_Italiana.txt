The staff is very friendly and food is tasty. It is not a big place,has space constraints.The garlic bread was very yummy and the Italian soda was lovely.Mushroom risotto was average.

As we were staying in Holiday Inn Orchard, This mall is within walking distance and we decided to grab our lunch here before taking the MRT to our intended destination. No regret - service was fast and attentive, even the waitress was patient regardless my kids' mischief.On the food:1. Pizza is very generous in size so please try not to over order - the tuna pizza was my kids' favourite.. they finished it in record time! 2. Salmon salad - we, the adult, were not as hungry so the salad will do with our other dish3. We managed to try the Burrata cheese (special in the menu.. seasonal I assume) together with the cold cut Parma ham and it was absolutely delicious. A bit noisy as this place was very busy - pedestrian-wise - but it was fun to see the endless passing by of the crowds

We noticed this place while passing by and felt like some Italian. They were offering a 2 for 1 deal on selected drinks and this was the clincher. We had a nice gnocchi with cheese sauce and an eggplant baked dish. Both were really good. Service as also there when we needed it. YMM

We stopped in for a delicious meal one night, and I ordered the pizza, thinking, for the price, it would be a small to medium size. Wrong...... it was a very generous size and delicious. The crust was firm and tasty. Hubby ordered lasagne and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Happy hour ended at 7 and we were able to order some wine just before the happy hour ended. The wine was very drinkable. Location - could possibly be a bit noisy on a busy evening, but a perfect place to enjoy your meal, cool drink and people watch as the world passes you by. We would happily return again
