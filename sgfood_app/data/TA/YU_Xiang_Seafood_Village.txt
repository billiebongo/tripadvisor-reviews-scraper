In case you're hubbing in Singapore for the night, instead of sleeping at the airport hotel, go to the Changi Village, only 15 minutes away from the main terminals and Sleep at the Village Hotel. Nearby the Hotel there are many small street restaurants and Bars, many of those serving until very late at night, all kinds of asian food, yet mostly chinese. Food at Yu Xiang is very well prepared and tasty ( Mongolian beef or lamb the best, as the Shezu Spicy soup ), service unexpectedly nice and fast. The place though it' orrific, plastic dirty tables and chairs, plastic chopsticks and plates. So if you're not too fussy, go there as the food is good, else, stop by at one of the " poshier" restaurant along the road. Be advised that many restaurants do not serve beer or alcohol for religious reason, ask before you sit
