We came here for our valentine day lunch. Both my wife and I like the food and the prices is reasonable. Will visit again next time to try other items on the menu.
5
Really good food. Like Omakase experience.
Legit spanish chef who explains to you what everything is only for you not to understand.
Nice place to drink wine and eat tapas. Spent $200+ for 2 people without wine though. So it's a bit pricey...
5
The service staff is very attentive and the food taste as good as it looks! Will love to come back again.
5
Stopped in on a walking tour of Singapore. Delicious food, great combinations. Fun atmosphere. Definitely recommended!

Do sit at the bar facing the chefs, this option is open for smaller diner groups and is well worthwhile. Larger tables are available upstairs but in reality this feels a little out of the way and I would suggest only for a large group.We ordered chefs suggested wines by the glass which proved to be a great option with the dishes.In terms of food we ordered through the menu with appetisers followed by a balance of the fish vegetable and meat dishes. All are wonderfully designed and presented.Worthwhile to take it fairly slowly and look around to watch the dishes as they are served to aid the selection.There is also a tasting menu which the people next to us had looked to be a great selection for a larger appetite
5
We went there on Saturday with no reservation. Nevertheless staff was so kind to find a table alfresco. We shared several tapas. There were just amazing fusion of Spain, Japan and France. Incredible mix of taste, texture and ingredients made these tapas much more than finger food. Itâ€™s gourmet level and unforgettable. A hidden jewel in this district
5
We only found this restaurant by accident when wondering around Jiak Chuan Road, and what a great surprise. Carlos, is a great young (looks 20'sh) dynamic Spanish chef, who should take full crate in creating some great Spanish dishes. Sitting at the bar (best place to be) watching him orchestrate his small team of chefs, is just pure entertainment. Not a mobile phone in sight, just a lot of happy people watching the show, as your plate gets created in front of you. The food is terrific, my favorite was the octopus, but the other plates do themselves a justice as well. What a great experience and what a great restaurant. Well Done Carlos. Brilliant. We will be back at the bar, for the next show
5
Esquina is one of the few small plates place that I've returned to a couple of times. I've always been seated outside/ first level but if you are there for a quiet dinner, I think the second level will be a good option. In particular, I enjoyed the grilled squid and my favourite for the night has to be the uni paella. Every bite was so flavourful and my friend and I wiped the dish in no time. We ordered spanish omelette, two croquettes, two oysters, gratin (this was the only one that was a little disappointing), the paella and the beer ice cream with various textures of banana (this dessert was absolutely marvelous too!) We each had a sangria too. We were a little too full so could probably do with one less dish.Esquina is quite the place to celebrate birthdays as well and they were quite nice to serve complimentary cake. There were 3 other couples celebrating birthdays when we were there! I would say the dessert ended the whole meal on a really good note. We paid around 189.50 for the two of us
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by some friends who lives in Singapore. It was nothing less than exceptional. We were lucky to get a seat at the "bar" which is part of the kitchen and were able to follow the creation of all the amazing dishes up close. Definitely on our top 3 list of restaurants to visit on future Singapore trips
5
A must visit, their lunch sets are value for money. Food is freshly prepared and do opt for counter seats so that you can see the kitchen in action. A must order is their Spanish octopus which is cooked in an oven heated up by charcoal. Great skill needed to control and maintain the temperature at optimal.
5
The tapas were overflowing with flavor and each bite was an explosive experience for the taste buds. Definitely recommend this restaurant for the food.
4
First time visitor and pleasantly surprised by the excellent food and friendly service. Nice ambience and location for a birthday celebration.
5
Best place in town for delicious tapas. Sit and linger a little at the kitchen bar table to see the team in action or opt for a quieter table to catch up with family or friends over a good meal and drinks. Check out their creative menus for the festive seasons
4
the place is more than a restaurant but has become a regular meet up place for friends - kitchen and chefs in feet away and you can feel the heat and passion. good food admit strong favors and perfect to go with drinks .. upper deck a bit quiet. only room to improve would be the turnaround time which may be overly strict, especially friends gather do not check the hours
5
Esquina is our favorite Spanish restaurant in Singapore. We always have a so good time there, enjoying the food A LOT!! The traditional pan con tomate, croquetas, tortilla and paella are our favourite. The chocolate mousse they offer at the end of your meal is amazing!!
5
Was at a new bar pre-opening nearby, and wanted to eat, so ended up eating at Esquina without any reservations. Our friend had dined there previously, so it came well recommended. The hostess, seated us outside while we waited to get tapas bar-side seating, which fortunately opened up quickly. From here, really enjoyed the quality and taste of each of the tapas dishes we ordered - specially the foie gras terrine special they had on the board, and the truffle potato dish. There were three of us sharing, and some of the serving sizes were on the small side, but the taste was big. Would definitely recommend eating here, and ideally with a reservation. One issue, was the music playing in the background was more rock, which did not fit the ambience of a Spanish tapas place (would recommend someone looking into their playlists)
2
food was extremely overpriced and we expected way better quality for that pricing. my group of friends and I went there for a birthday celebration and was thoroughly disappointed with the execution of the dishes. we had to adjourn to another place for round 2 dinner as we were far from being satisfied after spending a few hundred dollars at esquina
3
We had dinner for two at the bar at Esquina. Ambiance is good. Service was good. Wine/beer selection were good. We ordered several tapas. Some were good. Others we did not like as much. The paella was too fishy for us. Roasted cauliflower was very good. Spanish omelet was very good. Sliders were ok.I'd go back and give it another try
5
We were with some friends for a discovery tapas dinner and we were not disappointed ! We loved all the tapas proposed, at the ne did the dinner it was more than enough! We liked the design of the restaurant and the limited aircon upstairs. Fridenly staff, great food, good wine, good location, all you can ask for a evening with your friends! Recommended
5
Some say that the portions are too small, for us they were even at the large side. But Esquina is all about quality and imagination. After snacks (great oysters), land (try the lettuce Romaine!!!), sea (ceviche / scallops - a bit at the dry end) and land (suckling pig / ), we had no stamina for the desserts. Small but lovely selection of wine by the glass. Just one remark, sometimes the sweets are too prominent. Further: totally satisfied
5
Enjoyed our experience at esquina! Sat by the bar and saw the kitchen dynamics. Tapas portions were small, but are tapas so that’s the standard.
4
One of the places to go for tapas. Quality remains good but somewhat feel that it has dipped slightly. Charred Lettuce is highly recommended.
4
Have been Esquina a number of times in the last couple of months. Every time I am there I have enjoyed the various dishes and do repeat the favourites. The food is exquisite and the deserts are to kill for specially BBC.
4
Main courses are tasty, but drinks and desserts (too sweet) could be better. Hope could indicate the level of sweetness of the desserts. Had a great birthday at the place overall. 😊
5
Enjoyed our evening there with great food and great service. A bit pricey but worth it. Definitely will go back again on special occasions.
5
Finally got to sample a variety of their offerings through a tasting menu. The oyster was exquisitely paired with some very inventive ingredients. Gotta love the grilled octopus with grilled corn sauce as well. And the grilled lettuce...ok, they brought lettuce to another level. Enough said
1
We visited this evening. Couldn't believe the small servings we were offered. Service was patchy. Burger was raw. The cauliflower was fantastic, as was the croquettes and squid, what was offered, Sorry guys, at this price frankly extortion
4
Really enjoyed the tapas here. Got a seat at the bar where we could see the chefs preparing the dishes. We waited for quite a bit in the beginning even though reservation was already made. However in the end, due to the food being good and oh so pretty, everything ended up well. Will definitely come back agai
5
I have to say that I am not found of the Fusion Kitchen but this place has reached the best expectations I could have.A side from a lovely staff, the food was amazing and incredibly tasty. Even the vegetables, which usually are not something you remember of, were so delicious. I strongly recommend it.Prices?! Well, you won't find a cheap restaurants anywhere in Singapore other then the street-squares or street-food places
4
First time to dine at Esquina and we took advantage of the Chope Exclusive Tasting Menu $58++ per person x2. Service and food were good. Especially satisfied with the 'Tsarskaya Oysters' and 'Grilled Spanish Octopus'. Love the desserts too ie. 'Banana Cake Foam and Beer Ice Cream' and the 'Bread, Chocolate, Olive Oil'.Could have been better if only one of us can have the tasting menu and the other person order from the ala carte menu instead. Nevertheless, all is good. Can't wait to come back and try the food from the ala carte menu
4
Had the special tasting menu from Chope. Dishes were very tasty, and as tapas go, bitesized portions so don't expect to be full. Ended up wanting more food so ordered a la carte. Excellent paella and scallops! Worth a visit. Quite kid friendly.
4
This is our second time to the restaurant. Although it didn’t have much room for 5 people but we got a table outside. Despite the humid weather, we had an enjoyable time with the delicious food!
5
Great food, atmosphere was fantastic and the service from the wait staff was impeccable. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.
5
Brought my parents there to celebrate my mum’s birthday and she was very happy with the ambience and food quality. My Father, being typical Chinese, even sang praises about the food.
4
The food is small portion, as it's Tapas style, the taste is as good as the display.
The Service is also good, it's very interesting to sit at the bar counter and see how the food was prepared.
5
A place that cannot be missed both for locals and those visiting. Every single tapas is delicious, but take Chef Carlo's advice on his specials!
5
Love the place.. the food is great and service is good too. Would definitely return and try out other dishes. They even have free dessert end of the it.. and taste great!
5
Enjoyed watching how the chefs work so meticulously and passionately on the various dishes. Will definitely return to dine again. It's a feast to both the eyes and stomach. Just to name a few... Roasted cauliflower dish was uniquely crafted and extremely lovely. Patagonian toothfish ceviche had great blends of flavours and citrusy taste. Despite their busy-ness, the chefs were still very friendly and chatty. A great place to hang ou
5
We didn't have reservations so were given an outside table, but they had fans and it was comfortable. The corner (esquina) that the restaurant sits on is not busy so it is a quiet place to sit and take in the atmosphere. Our waitress was helpful in directing us to popular dishes. We particularly liked the Truffled Burrata with beets, the lobster and prawn paella was out-of-this-world (they were out of sea urchin but we were happy with that). The Spanish omelette was melt-in-your mouth, we should have followed the waitress' recommendation and ordered two, though. We decided we needed just something more so asked if there was any chance they may offer a cheese plate? Voila! Beautiful manchego and honey with bread. We followed with the Chocolate Malt fondant dessert and walked it all off in the charming neighborhood on our way back to the hotel. Highly recommend
3
The food was great though abit on the salty side. Probably that's how it should be for spanish dishes but it's a little above my threshold. The best dish i had was the sea urchin and lobster paella. It can be quite gelat for one person, so i'd recommend this to be shared. The seats were a little uncomfortable at the counter, which is also one of the reason prompting us to leave earlier.
4
The visual appeal and the taste of the food was very good..the staffs are very friendly and efficient
3
The sea urchin paella was superb. Other dishes were unimpressive. If they telll you that they are gonna seat you on level one, it means you are gonna sit at the bar.
5
Everything was great!!! Just "take my money"! Please do check out this place even though it doesn't look that attractive and look just like any random cafe. But it isn't just any random cafe. The food may be pricier, but it was worth every penny and dollar and it is of top-notch premium quality. It was unreasonably good, now I can't stop thinking about everything I had at Esquina.wanted to give a lengthy review for this place, but it still doesn't do justice to the goodness of the food. Must try: Carabinero prawns in chilli garlic oil for $15++(seasonal limited edition item), Potato and truffle “gratin”in burnt onion sauce with iberico ham for $20++, Sea urchin and lobster paella, saffron aioli for $32++.We had the bar counter seats and we could watch each and every move of the chefs in the kitchen. However, this comes with the price because of the heat from the cooking in the kitchen, hence it was slightly warmer. Service was very personalised. The waiters and waitress would explain every dish like how you are suppose to eat it, and there was also a complimentary dessert after the meal! Also, the head chef did a QC check (e.g checking the done-ness of dishes/taste test of the dishes/checking if the food was hot enough when it was served) on each and every dish before it was served to ensure that the customers get nothing but the best
4
Really enjoyed our dinner there, especially for sitting at the bar and overlooking at the chef controlling every single dish going to the table.Charming welcome and attentive staff.I strongly recommend the paella which was amazing.Wine menu would deserve to be slightly wider (even if I found what I usually like)A place to recommen
5
Was attending a special 10 courses degustation dinner and was very impressed by the quality of the food, the creativity and the flavours of every dishes one after the other, great tapas delicately executed. The wine pairing was beautifully matched and the ambiance around the bar overlooking the chefs for electric. I would like to mention a special thank you to the wonderful manageress, very professional and of course ... so charming. All in one a great evening because of a superb understanding between the F&B team. A new fan from Shanghai
4
Before: They were quick to respond to my query and booking. First impression: small & narrow frontage but exquisite. Level 1 only counter seats but not disrupting as we could savour our food without any weird looks. Lunch: innovative & unique, delicious and attentive to details as we were given short intro of each dish what it was comprised of. Portion is small for the price but I guess uniqueness comes with a price. Overall experience: Very good
4
16th August 2017 set dinner menu was superb & good value. Not all the dishes were to my liking. But my favorites were the oysters, king crab, roasted cauliflower, & spanish octopus. We sat by the dynamic kitchen which needed more ventilation, particularly as the kitchen is really hot. And perhaps to set up more comfortable stools. We had a good wine pairing; but perhaps not a good idea to have a vermouth at the end. Once you abruptly change from grape based wines to a vermouth, there may be a rapid change in ones constitution.
4
Love the tapas here. It used to be under Jason Atherton's restaurant groups so if you have been to 22 Ships in Hong Kong, some dishes will be familiar. (Great to have my favourite dessert again!)However, Esquina has its own unique offering. Service is also good.Will definitely frequent this place
5
My 4th time in this restaurant and it hasn't failed.Pork jowl, grilled spanish octopus, potato and truffle gratin, spanish suckling pig among other things are my favourite. Forgot to mention the sliders. Its an experience seating by the kitchen bar on a high chair watching the chefs do their thing. Ive seated upstairs which is quite cozy and outside its really pleasant especially when its not hot. The staff are very attentive and very accommodating. A favorite in Singapore
4
I had dinner here on Saturday 12 August with a visiting family member (3 adults total). We were seated outside and there was a pleasant atmosphere and fans provide some cooling, which is always needed in Singapore.The food is of really high quality and all tasted delicious. My only comment would be that some of the portions are rather small, especially the octopus and the potato truffle gratin. The sea urchin/lobster paella is decent size and was good. My favorite was however the family reserve beef ribeye which was cooked to perfection. Deserts (2x Chocolate Cake and 1x BBC) was a good finish to our mealService was friendly and polite.We ordered 3 starters, 4 mains and 3 desserts and 1 glass of wine and total bill was 250$
2
The tapas here is excellent. All delicious were mildly exotic and mouth watering. The cauliflower stood out. The staff were wonderful and very honest over portion size so we didn't go home hungry just with an enormous hole in our pockets.
5
superb food, tiny portions. The pulpo, whilst delicious, had just two pieces in it which was particularly stingy
4
It was my third visit and i reckon i had tried everything on the menu. I hope to see some new intro every other month, but sad to say, it is quite the same.
3
I have ordered three tiny tapas leaving the place still hungry and I have paid so much. Couldn't believe my eyes. Plus one tapas only was good out of three. I wouldn't suggest it.
5
All food recommended by their staff is excellent and Yummy! Will definitely come back for more! Great food! Great staff!
5
Awesome food but very very expensive-- a great experience nonetheless with great ambiance and food...
4
With most of the seats at the bar looking into the open plan kitchen, there is a great atmosphere and you get to watch the prep and plating skills at work. My first two dishes were sublime. Beautifully conceived, balanced and presented, both the roast cauliflower and ceviche were delectable. I should have stopped there.My final dish of lamb neck just failed to work. A rather strange, slightly bitter sauce that clashed with the accompaniments, none of which tasted good in their own right. It was also visually unappealing, especially after the perfection of the previous two dishes.I'd definitely go back, just need to be careful ordering next time
5
The missus and I have been to Esquina a few times now, as a couple and with groups of friends. It's fantastic every time. Clever, surprising, and unusual for such a high end kitchen, generously portioned tapas arrive thick and fast from the open kitchen to the theatre seating around the bar.Our last visit saw a lightly marinated scollop and oyster ceviche; a layered potato dish, much like a dauphinois, with an extraordinary burnt onion and truffle sauce; Mackerel and pea with an amazing almond soup; a heroic duck breast; lamb that one friend actually applauded ... you get the idea, the food here is really quite special.The loud owner swans about being overly friendly and obtuse, but not even he can distract from Esquina's superb kitchen, and the far more important staff are welcoming and fun loving, smart and efficient. Esquina is great, and if you enjoy modern tapas style cuisine in an open but intimate kitchen concept, I promise you a great night out
5
This restaurant is amazing! Casual, cool and with exquisit food. We were so lucky to be seated in the bar and had a great view over the kitchen. This made it to a very authentic experience. We looked on what was made and ordered the food that looked the best ( though everything looked amazing). Everything we were served was beyond good, including the wine!Thank you for a great experience!
4
The ambience is great, the food was really good! The grilled octopus was the bomb, the lobster paella could be better in my personal opinion, but I would definitely recommend this place for a Spanish tapas lover, quaint little corner for great food, not to mention that they were so nice to prepare a little birthday surprise for my Friend, topping it off with compliments on the house as well. I'd totally go back for a good occasion again
3
Food was nice and well presented. But seriously overpriced for the tiny amount you get on the plate. I would not recommend this place, you can get more more food elsewhere for a better price.
4
this place never fails to impress our palates. food is always great, and the service staff ever so attentive
5
if you are pationate about tapas and good quality ....Esquina is the place to visit. Seating at the counter makes a difference. Expect to spend 2-3 hours
5
Tapas cantina meets hipster diner. This place has it all, a fantastic bustling bar/open kitchen (really recommend sitting here if you can get a seat) or sinning around the back. Quirky and eccentric but without being pretentious. Give it a go.
5
Not a place you dine at on a budget but defiantly if your a foodie.Great atmosphere & friendly experienced staff really good Spanish tucker.The young chef brigade deserve the accolades, offering a fine dining cuisine in casual Setting with great wine & company what more does one need
5
What a wonderful experience. We visited this little gem with family who live in Singapore. They talked it up but let me tell you Carlos and the team exceeded our high expectations. From the welcome drinks on arrival to the little surprise waffle cones prior to leaving all was spectacular! Highlights for me were the suckling pig and the banana desert with beer ice cream - delicious! Thank you so much to the entire team for your passion, attention to detail, attentiveness and pure love of creating the perfect and unique dining experience.
5
This is one of the world's most interesting restaurants and most unique experiences. It is tapas, yes, so do not expect buffet size pilings of food. Other places will do that for you. The dishes are intricate, an alchemy of flavours yes, so expect to pay a little more. But if you choose cleverly then you will find that even with good drinks this spend is much less than most other top restaurants in Singapore. We love it here but had never been with family, only with friends and as a couple. Our family group of 5 included a 10yo who loved it; so too a little girl sitting with her Dad nearby. We perched at the counter on the comfy vintage tractor seats to watch the show, taking the corner stools so we could all chat. Such a wonderful dinner last night, with some bubbles and tastes (the famous croquettes and Spanish omelettes) to get us on our way at the start and the yummy cone to finish on the palate post dessert. Everything was superb as always, the food, the service, the wine, the atmosphere. Chef Carlos, Myra, Corinne and team, our family guests were delighted and super impressed. To have enough of us to order every dessert has always been a dream; while we thoroughly enjoyed meandering through the menu. The pork main was indeed a game changer, but consistency with the various beetroot, romaine, cauliflower and potato dishes (none near as simple as I make them sound) also needs a special mention, all delightful. Seared foie gras, pate like in taste, yum, like the special prawn dish. We really appreciated everything and will be back again soon because they exceeded our expectations yet again
4
Nice service, wonderful food. The food is excellent - well prepared and presented. The wine selection is limited, but quite nice. Wine is averaged price for restaurants in Singapore, maybe a bit expensive. You will pay around $85 for a decent bottle, more if you like of course. The portions are small. Best not to go if you are very Hungary as you will pay a small fortune. Spanish omelette was lovely. Paella with sea urchin was wonderful. Of course the iberico ham was juicy and delicious. Overall a nice night out with friends. I would give it 5 stars if not for the price.
5
Probably THE most visually exciting, not to mention one of the most delicious dinners I have ever had...and I've eaten A LOT of restaurants in a lot of places.Esquina Singapore - Request Table 9 as it is the best seat in the house. If you are in Singapore you can't miss visiting this restaurant. You will not regret it. One of the absolute Highlights of my travels. P.S. These pictures don't even BEGIN to do justice to the taste, atmosphere, or experience. I would come back to Singapore just to eat here again
5
The main body of the restaurant is organised around the kitchen along a wonderful bar that makes you feel like you're part of the action. The menu and activity of the. Chef and sous chefs are both wonderful to watch, and better to sample. So imagine that you are sat at the bar, lively music and people surround you - then our first plates arrivedFirst was roast cauliflower - this is a very under rated vegetable - probably because it has been so mistreated. Here, it's roasted and served on a bed of cauliflower couscous. Give this humble vege another try, it was a treat. Then the croquettes - creamy, but firm. Crispy on the outside, moist inside. I could have as many as they could make. Octopus, suckling pig and the peppers followed - whilst I bunch them together - they were all unique and prepared with love and care. Special mention for the paella - lobster and sea urchin - deep flavours, creamy sea urchin. Probably my favourite Service was very good from beginning to end - not over bearing, good recommendationsIf you're visiting, some suggestions1 - make a reservation, the phone system will ask you to press 1 to make a reservation.... press 2 instead, and speak to the restaurant - they were so much more welcoming than the computer 2 - walking to the restaurant - it's a long stroll. Take your time and there are a few bars along the way to make sure you don't arrive thirsty3 - say hello the the couple next to you on the bar4 - everything on the menu is worth trying5 - I didn't try the beer ice cream, but I'd love to hear about that Enjoy
5
Came here yesterday for lunch and opted for the $38++ set consisting of a snack, a tapas a main a dessert and a cone. All the items were really very tasty, although quantities were small: we were both still a bit hungry afterwards.
5
Our first time back here since the chef changed (so it's been a while!), and food was better than ever! The oysters, paella, potato gratin were great, service was great.
5
We had some delicious dishes, tapas here. The staff was very friendly and talkative. We also got access to a nearby "secret" bar nearby after dinner. I recommend to everyone
5
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Totally gorgeous food. Every dish was just fabulous. I will most definitely make it a regular haunt
5
We had a very nice dinner at the lively bar where everything happens in front of you. Quality and presentation of the dishes was top notch and also the service, despite the place was fully booked. Ask to be seated at the bar. We will go again.
4
Food was so so yummy and great buzzy atmosphere. We had a really great night. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather that 5 was because my husband found the seating a little uncomfortable. But apart from that everything was fab! Service was great too which we find quite rare in Singapore
5
Esquina was the final place we visited during our visit to Singapore and it delivered on all fronts. We visited on a Friday night. Esquina is situated on the busy Jiak area near to Potato Head Folk etc but it's relaxed vibe juxtaposes its neighbours nicely. My gf and I went for the sangria and "bar snacks". The snacks included Bread and Mushroom butter, Chorizo Croquettes, Spanish Sushi and Omellette - bite size portions at a reasonable price. The quality and imagination behind each of these made for a completely unique dining experience that was only meant to be casual. Service was top notch too. Along with Ding Dong, our fav place to eat at Singapore.
5
We went for lunch and it was great fun sitting at the bar watching the chefs prepare the various dishes. I must say the cast iron stools were pretty uncomfortable but, after a while, with the excellent house wine and tasty dishes, you forget the discomfit! Everything is freshly prepared and beautifully presented with the staff explaining the constituents of each dish, which is a nice touch. This place is not cheap but each dish has quantity enough for two people to share adequately. We stayed and watched the two European chefs prep for dinner and they were fanatical about their food which is a good sign in any restaurant. Diners assume tapas have got to be Spanish and expect a certain level of conformity. Esquina serves Spanish style tapas but mixed with some Asian influence which makes this place a unique dining experience. Reservation recommended if you want to sit at the bar and watch the 'kitchen show'. It's well worth it!
5
Esquina got lucky. Their promotional email caught me on a day when I had time to read it (I usually delete 'SPAM'). It was also a day when I happened to reconnect with an old friend who also loves great food. Even better, the deal was S$55+ per head for a six course sampler of Esquina's menu. I booked. We went. It was sensational. Every course was slightly better than the last one - and the first was delicious. We even broke the flow to order a couple of a la carte dishes before desert. Every dish was exemplary, as was the wine we ordered to accompany it, as was the superb service. This is my new favourite restaurant in Singapore.
5
We came here on a lovely, sunny Friday lunchtime. We'd planned to sit outside but as it was quiet warm we sat indoors.Both inside and out are high, stool chairs and high tables (maybe one or two low tables outside but had stool seats). The main indoor area has a metal, sushi style bar with old, metal tractor seats as stools and an open kitchen right behind the bar. All very retro, throwback, funky and fun. The staff are absolutely lovely and attentive and the wine was excellent. But the food is the star!! Every dish we had was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. I'm looking forward to coming back to Esquina for lunch!
5
Our first visit to esquina very progressive tapas incredibly delicious, fantastic service and atmosphere.
4
As usual amazing food with great service.
Lunchtime deal is amazing with a very sharable menu for two pax.
5
After 4.5 years living in Singapore, Esquina was our choice for our last meal. It has always been our favourite for small celebrations. Our final meal was superb. Wonderful flavours, expert cooking and delightful service. We will miss you Esquina!
5
Truly authentic experience and the Tapas was out of this world! Can't recommend this enough! We loved it!!
5
If you havent been, you need to go soon... the food is super. We went as 2 couples and shared about 6 dishes, it was just divine. We had a couple of bottles of wine too, total bill came in around $100 per head which I thought was fair considering how good the food and wine were. We sat outside the weather was great, however, if you were just a couple, I'd suggest sitting at the bar as it would be great to watch them prepare the food. The chef also gave us a small free dessert which was a real surprise. Would I go again, definitely! Would I recommend it to others, definitely

Disclaimer: Being a Spaniard I tend to be a tough judge when it comes to international Spanish cuisine :). The menu selection at Esquina is spectacular, the toughest part of the evening was deciding what to have from a myriad of tantalising proposals. To cut the story short - some of the dishes were outstanding, not only in execution and creativity, but in flavours and texture - particular mention to the pork jowl and green asparagus with cured wagyu belly!!! The wine list (not cheap) has a good selection of Spanish wines. Although this wouldn't be my first choice in town to indulge on Bacchus' juice. However other dishes were a tad disappointing. The dish execution didn't not much up its potential. Read below for details if you are not bored by now. All in all, worth the visit! Specially because afterwards we got to learn and get invitations to The Library (secret cocktail bar with extraordinary ambiance). Now to the details: We settled with the Pork Jowl, ibérico chorizo croquetas, green asparagus with idazabal cheese and cured waygu belly. For mains we ordered the sea urchin and lobster paella, the braised beef and port cannelloni with foe gras and cepes and the Iberian pulled pork sliders with foe gras. Let's say we didn't go shy!!! All dishes solid. The sliders' patty was juicy, you could taste the truffle and foie gras. I've already mentioned the favourites - pork Jowl and asparagus with wagyu (stunning!!!). The paella had too much 'socarrat' - the burnt rice that sticks to the bottom of the paella dish. The socarrat is usually very nice (crunchy and with lots of flavour), but in this instance it had too much burnt flavour overtaking the delicate and beautifully fresh sea urchin. The cannelloni sauce, although very creamy, unfortunately tasted like mushroom creamy Campbell soup .... hence the verdict - interesting, creative and almost, almost amazing.

You should go if:You are looking for a cool place / bar to hangout, with friends or for a dating. The concept is modern and the ambiance is hipster & vivid. It's very unique in Singapore.Probably not for you if:You are looking for a traditional tapas restaurant and you hunt for good food and drinks ONLY. We went there for a birthday celebration. Service was professional and everything was in order and went smoothly. They also prepared a little birthday cake :)We ordered Fresh Oyster, Fried Baby Octopus, Grilled Little Green Peppers, Paella, Suckling Pig and one dessert made with banana, plus one Sangaria and one cocktail (I forget). Oyster was fresh & sweet, totally enjoyed it. Octopus, Pepper and Paella were good yet ordinary. The chef added in a bit twist into the cooking though I personally prefer traditional style in comparison.Suckling pig is well cooked & timed with very crispy skin and tender meat, which is the essence of suckling pig, satisfied. The seasoning and portion was not perfect though.The cocktails we were a bit disappointed. They tasted plain and maybe diluted too much.The final bill was about $100 each, which was a bit expensive but still ok. Overall it's a good restaurant (yet to be great) and the team is putting real effort into it, Ambiance is its highligh

My wife and I enjoy Spanish food and have been almost all the top co-called Spanish restaurents in Singapore and we find Esquina one of the best that we have been to. The menu is quite wide ranging and the food is tasty. We compliment the staff for their smiling faces and great service.
5
Truly a wonderful experience. If you want to be close the action, watching the hardworking, speedy chefs carefully plate little delicacies; sit downstairs on the stools. The Tapas was delicious, my favourite being the 'Spanish Octopus'. I also thoroughly enjoyed the scallops with a perfect brown sear on both sides. However, the real gem of the restaurant is the precise, delicate plating of all the dishes, from appetisers to desserts. The waiting staff were extremely helpful and quick. Will be back soon :
4
Enjoyed the food there with my colleague. Food is always great but tend to be rather rich flavored. Cramp seating and makes serving difficult and often uncomfortable when someone has to squeeze through and pour wine. The fixed seats should be changed at one point of tim
5
Our second time to Esquina and we will be back again...and again. Incredible food, friendly staff and a lovely place to dine.
5
Absolutely superb, the food is prepared in front of you if you sit at the bar counter. One of the best restaurants in Singapore serving authentic Spanish food.
Highly recommended
4
Was my second time- food remains good! And there is a change of menu every now and then to ensure that we won't get tired of it
5
Forget what you find on Las Ramblas in Barcelona... this is tapas with a sophisticated twist. Service is always excellent too!
5
Esquina is a first rate restaurant with a great chef. The food was flawless and the service was friendly and efficient. It was our anniversary so we were given 2 glasses of champagne on the house. I really loved everything about this place and would recommend it to anyone.
5
I was able to get a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchen with only a short wait. Watching your dinner being carefully prepared is fascinating, and builds up the appetite for some great food. I ate extremely well: Crispy baby squid, chilli coriander,squid ink aioli; Iberico bellota “Joselito” with pan con tomate; Pigeon, forest berries escabeche,burnt rosemary polenta, crisp shallots (the pigeon was melt-in-the-mouth - the best I have ever eaten); and Warm chocolate fondant, malt ice cream, chocolate 100’s & 1000’s
5
Absolutely fantastic. Once again the team has provided Her Majesty and I with an amazing evening. Cannot wait to return. The suckling pig and also the strawberry dessert. Wow....just Wow! Lobster paella was also a true standout dish. Wine list could be better but still the selections were Ok and the prices reasonable. A busy bustling little place with great vibes and great food. Love it. Xxxxxxxxx
4
Expect to spend more than $120 for 2 people, especially if you have drinks & dessert. But the food is amazing - tapas is served in small portions, and presentation of food is also nice. I highly recommend the burrata cheese with beetroot and walnut. The mini pork burger is also fantastic with the melt in your mouth patty. Great service too. Suitable place for birthdays and special occasions where you don't mind spending more.
5
Great menu and wine pairing. Brilliant service! But just a couple of things to note: The last item on the main menu - the meat was chewy and the flavour didn't quite 'emerge'.I ordered tea, but the way it was served in just a cup without a provision for sugar in a bowl or in a tea pot felt a bit like I ordered tea in a foodcourt. But your waiters were efficient, friendly and knowledgeable on product offering - which made the experience exceptional!
5
My wife and I were in China town having a wander and had been told Esquina's was worth a visit. we rocked up and sat at the bar in front of the chef and staff preparing meals. The staff the food was amazing, the flavours of each dish were just really something and you can't beat the entertainment value of watching the kitchen staff in operation. We will definitely be going back be it for lunch it dinner
5
Awesome treat for those who are willing to try something new than just the regular ! The restaurant had a good buzz to the food and the ambience .
3
This is my third time to Esquina and I must say I was rather disappointed with the food and service.
5
Located in a nice tiny street in Chinatown, it is a really lovely place. Food is amazing! nice, tasty and perfectly cooked. A proper Spanish tapas restaurant.
Little bit expansive but in Singapore is standard..
5
I really loved my first Esquina experience. What a way to sum up my Singapore tour. The place was fancy, food was great and the service was excellent. It was super crowded on a Friday night, yet, the guy who attended us (Jeff), managed to give us the best table - outdoor seating! My friend and I will definitely come back
2
Booked 2 wks prior. Only got phone call on day of dinner we had to give our 730pm table back at 9pm. How to arrange alternatives last min? Was told at dessert at we can have it outside n vacate table. Spent $850 ++ for 5. Won't b going back
4
The food was awesome but they ran out of tow of the items we wanted to order - and it was only 8:00 p
5
Loved Esquina. Went on a Friday night - seats are at bar, facing the kitchen. Was brilliant to watch these incredible chefs and kitchen team, work some seamlessly and artistically. The food presentation was simple yet artistic and the flavours were innovative, surprising but all grounded with a traditional Spanish feel. Would definitely come back. Staff were attentive, wine was great and atmosphere was buzzing and electric! Loved it
4
We had a tasting menu comprising eight highlight dishes plus one dessert. The food doesn't quite come across immediately as Spanish but the ingredients were unique and flavorful. I particularly like the oyster, spanish omelette and the toothfish, a fish I only heard of only now. The spanish roast pig was nothing to shout about but perhaps because the tasting portion was too small for me to savour it thoroughly. The beer ice cream in the dessert BBC was an unusual choice but no one would turn down a beer I suppose
4
This is a high end restaurant. Excellent quality of food and wine- just don't go very hungry. Yes, it's Spanish, but the dishes are not tapas. Expect- $100 for a pleasant bottle of wine (good price in Singapore), $30 for a main dish. Service could be a little (well ok, a lot !) friendlier.
5
As one with a particular dietary requirement, would like to say thank you to a kind male service staff (Sorry could not remember the name) who patiently highlighted to me what I could and could not eat. Was in a large group hosted by a German education agency, which has already pre-ordered everything so was delighted that this waitstaff discreetly explained to me on the food. Kudo
5
Amazing food and a great Menu del Dia which gave you a choice of 3-5 options and they were all wonderful. Has a beautiful open kitchen and the chefs were awesome as they explained everything about the awesome food. Staff was great!
5
This is my favorite restaurant in Singapore. The food and service standards are consistent, making me wanting to keep going back.
5
Our daughter who lives here is a regular and we had a simply beautiful tapas dinner. About $70 a head but worth every peso!! Will be back....Must Book! Very busy.
5
Travelling on my own I often chose to sit at the bar so you can see all the action. Food was delicious, service great and good wines offered by the glass. I particularly recommend the Potato and black truffle “gratin”, onion sauce, organic egg yolk, iberico ham. Really subtle and delicious. I stupidly over ordered, which is easy when everything sounds so good. Need to book as it gets very busy
4
We was there for a diner, was great experience we try almost all items in a menu, and all was great surprise.Don't wait for real Spanish tapas, but enjoy fine taste and some great surprises.I put 4 because service was bit slow, maybe because Saturday evening so bit over booked!!One thing you can avoid is the omelette not tasty and very small! But one you can't miss in foie gras...
5
The food is absolutely fantastic. Creative Spanish kitchen with an Asian touch. All served in sharing style portions, which allows for people to taste a large variety of the menu card selection. Will recommend to sit in the bar if visiting in a smaller group (up to three) - the atmosphere there is great.Will for sure be back next time I come to Singapor
3
The service was rather slow and erratic on a Monday night. Late with cocktails and soem food came faster than others. Not sure why it is listed in the Michelin guide
4
We tried the 10 course Valentine's Day tasting menu. Despite many customers, the waiters were very attentive and served one course right after another. The food was great though portion might be slightly small to share for 2 persons. We expected to be offered 2 seater table especially on this special Valentine's Day. However, despite being the first couple to turn up at the restaurant, we were seated at a 8 seater table. Do specify and ask for a 2 seater table if you would like some privacy.
5
We went in for lunch and sat at the bar, the server was attentive without being overbearing. We ordered from the set lunch special and had one of the best meals we've had in Singapore to date! Standouts were the grilled octopus (delicious and soft) and cauliflower with cous cous and Manchester. Everything presented was a modern twist on traditional tapas and well cooked. We loved sitting at ththe open kitchen and ended up ordering an additional dish of foie terrine which was a special of the day and did not disappoint. The wine match with lunch was perfect too, we will definitely back.very cool decor with a great atmosphere
5
Enjoying a night with Carlos and his Team is an experience everyone should try at least once in their life. You will only appreciate it if you like the concept of sharing tapas and meals prepared to perfection. No plate will leave the kitchen unless it has been approved by the chef. Ideal seating is two persons at the counter where you can follow every move in the kitchen. This is for people appreciating details. This is not about big plates...it's about sharing plates....and quality.
5
Such a nice location and set in an old shophouse. Food and service was really good. Loved the paella. Shall return!
5
very swift confirmation using Chope. Good food and nice ambience, definitely recommend to my friends and family
5
We had a wonderful lunch at Esquina!This hidden restaurant is modern.I highly recommend to seat at the bar to see chef Carlos and his brigade operating!The proposed food is a nice twist between Spanish and modern food - looking good and super tasty!!
5
Had the 5-course tasting menu. Love the effort and detail in all their dishes -sit at the counter for the best view. Every dish is accompanied by a personal explanation. Esquina delights with complimentary surprises. This time we had the signature sangria with flavored foam. Always exciting to dine at Esquina
3
I guess I am more of a traditional Spanish food fan so this wasn't what I was quite expecting.Interesting and contemporary... I really like the potato gratin and the beer ice cream!
5
Me and my mother came in and absolutely enjoyed every single dish. We weren't sure on what to order but chef Mateu didn't hesitate to offer us to do a menu for us. Everything he picked was great! The cannelloni was my favorite as well as the pulpo!(octopus) If you are in Singapore and you wish to enjoy a gastronomical experience, Esquina is the place to be!
5
Esquina is always a great night out. So the arrival of guest chef Nacho from Barcelona was too tempting to miss. The dinner was served by Nacho himself and every course complimented the previous one. Highlights were roast suckling pig, foie gras, cod and the chef's take on a Ferrero Rocher for dessert. Outstanding meal
5
My friends and I were seated at a corner of Level 2 of the restaurant. It was quiet and we have our privacy totally. We ordered the 5th year anniversary tasting menu, majority of us love the oyster for its freshness and the grilled squid for its texture. Overall a very pleasant dining experience!
2
Came here for their tasting menu. We had an outdoor seat and the chairs were not super comfy but the ambience was nice. But the food was disappointing. Heard somewhere they just changed Head Chef. If you are just looking for drinks then it's a nice place. If you are looking for awesome food, skip this and head down the street to Burn Ends instead
5
can't remember how many times I've been here but it was always a good experience. the main highlight was to have that caberino grilled prawn that was the daily special for that day! it was tasty and fresh which made it very flavourful. enjoyed the Spanish omelette and squid as usual and surely a must order!
5
Food is always good. In my humble opinion, they have the best paella in town - I love the crispy and almost a bit burnt texture of the rice. Croquettas are always a favourite too. Limited champagne selection though.
4
We weren't sure of what to order and the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable in his recommendations. Food is excellent/
4
One of my favourite Spanish restaurants in town. Food is good, expensive but always consistent. Dependable
5
Excellent Spanish food, better than even in Spain! Chef very creative, great ingrediants, service. Extensive menu. Something for everyone. Great rocknroll music in background. Fun place!
4
Enjoyed watching chef take special care in preparing the dishes. Food was beautifully presented and just delicious. Fun and casual atmosphere. Great place for gathering and business lunch.
4
Second time celebrating my birthday here. Food is of good quality and the head chef is immaculate in preparing the dishes. You can watch all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from the counter seats, which makes the dinner an entertaining one. I enjoyed the sea urchin dish in December 2015 but sadly they had removed it from the menu. This year, I enjoyed the grilled octopus the most. The outside of the octopus was nicely charred but still retained its tenderness; a very flavorful dish that seafood lovers would enjoy. I would also recommend the paella. The fried chillis were a little disappointing;this is one of the dishes I miss most from Spain. Apart from that, all other items were excellent. Be sure to pair your food with cava.
5
We had our company Christmas dinner at Esquina. The service was tip top, appreciate all the service crew for their kind and attentive service rendered to us.. The food was amazing, we had about 6 dishes, all was well presented and taste really delicious. We will definitely patronise again.
4
I've never been to Esquina, and didn't know about the restaurant. At first, menu items were minimal in choices but each dish were very tastefully cooked and paired with the ingredients. Food was amazing ! Each dish was unique and different and taste was surprising and delicious. Enjoyed tremendously. Service was alittle disappointing as they said we had to return the table by 8pm, but then allowed us to order another dish in the end. Would have been better just to extend the time at the beginning so that guests can enjoy the evening without rushing.Otherwise was happy with the food overall
5
For someone who hardly writes an review, this place is definitely worth my effort to pen down my latest dining experience.To start off, prior to my reservation I emailed Esquina to esquire if they were able to provide a Chinese launguage menu or allow me to do my own translation as I foresee that Taiwanese boyfriend might have issue understanding the menu. However, I was told that the staff would take care of us on the day itself to ensure our dining experience remains seamless. Well, to be honest, I didn't buy their words for the simplest reason that why would anyone bother about you on a busy Friday night? Well, I was definitely wrong.The moment we enter the place, they got a Chinese waiter to attend to us. John (pls correct me if I got the name wrong, he was the gentlemen standing in the cashier that day), explained to us the menu and eventually we trusted him to decide the food for us! For that, every tapas was a pleasant surprise. Love those oysters, cauliflower and delicious burgers! The food was spectacular, I had their classic BBC dessert and literally the BEST dessert I had in my entire life. But to be honest, it was the service that was provided by the ladies and gentlemen which elevated our dining experience. I was really so touched when the staff took effort to explained each dishes upon arrival. I could still recall clearly how one of the Ang Moh chef presented and explained the meal to us in English. And right after, one of your staff (the one that seriously look like Nathan Hartono) came over and explained it in Chinese, SPECIALLY FOR US. Could you even image the level of genuine care and concern they shower their guests?If I were to pick on things for improvement, it would definitely be NAME TAGS. Without name tags, it is really hard to us to identify and comment those individual ladies and gentlemen for their hardwork. Esquina, trust me , you will be surprise at how well the your employees are performing both as an individual and as a team. This restaurant is definitely a place filled with passionate employees who are constantly there to ensure that your needs are always met. A big thank you to the wonderful ladies and gentlemen of Esquina which made our special night, much much more special. Looking forward to the next visit there again
4
Everything is awesome! I would have given a 5/5 stars review as I wouldn't ask for more on the standard of food and service!However, I saw two of their main chefs re-using the spoons that they used to taste the food without washing. After tasting the food, they just dig the spoons into a small tub of water and reusing it again for tasting. I don't think this is hygiene
3
Good value for money! Delicious and unique way of making sangria. Personal favourite would - sea urchin tapas.
5
Their dessert "BBC" is one of the best i ever had. Lovely food and attentive service. Great ambience sitting outdoors but if you are interested in cooking, its really amazing to sit at the bar counter on Level 1 watching them smashing out dishes.
5
Great place
Nice to see professional chefs working in front of guest
Really deserve to be visit
Pretty busy most of the time
Ask the che for recommendations
Foie gras cannelloni is to die for!!!!
5
Been here quite a few times and the food is always on point and the staff are very good. My favourite restaurant in SG!
3
Staff is knowledgeable about food offerings. Food is good for some while disappointing for some: Crispy squid and roasted cauliflower is good. Paella is mediocre. Way too pricey overall for what you get.
5
Esquina blew me away, from the first bite to the last the food was delicious, so much so that I felt it was like eating a tasting menu at a top flight restaurant but where I got to pick all my favourite dishes. The young Spanish chefs are excellent, and as they are cooking right in front of you take the time to explain the dishes, the Dingily Dell pork, grilled Spanish octopus and beetroot with whipped truffle burrata were particularly fabulous.The restaurant itself is very small so do book before going, most of the seating is at the bar which encloses the kitchen area, so if you are a party of more than two I suggest asking for the corner seating so that you can easily talk to each other. There are also tables outside.The waiting staff are well trained, managing to keep track of dishes in a cramped space.This restaurant should be nominated for a Michelin star, so go now whilst you can book as this is definitely a restaurant to watch
4
Was at Esquina for lunch and had the 4-course lunch set.Spanish omelette: Appeared and tasted average at first bite, but every chew on the olive oil 'caviar' sprinkled on top lends it a subtle yet increasing depth in flavour. A sign of things to come: innocent at first sight, but deliciousness hidden within.Roasted cauliflower: Appeared ordinary at first sight too, lots of white on the plate: slightly charred cauliflower pieces with sprinkles of cauliflower bits and cheese, topped with Serrano ham. The different textures really gets to you. The charred sides of the roasted cauliflower lent it a crisp savouriness. The 'cous-cous' made of cauliflowers were soft and pairs well with the shaved Manchego cheese. The saltiness and bite of the ham brings the dish together. I would order this again.Braised beef & pork cannelloni: The cannelloni, with braised pulled beef and pork filling, was delicious as well. It came with a few slices of black truffle but unfortunately Singapore is not the place to have black truffles since they lose their flavour fast, and truffles don't grow here.Sangria cone: A little ice cream cone with sangria ice cream, served just before dinner while the chef gets your dessert ready. It was sharp and fruity like a good sangria would be, but would have been better with more alcohol in it.BBC: The dessert. It had textures of banana, that is cubes of banana, banana cake and banana cream. Served with some of the best beer ice cream I've had as it had a savoury maltiness in it that paired well with the banana textures. It was drizzled with warm caramel sauce but I think the dessert is better with less of the caramel. It was a good end to lunch there.The food was good, and worth a return trip so that I can try some of their signatures such as grilled octopus and paella.If there was anything bad about Esquina, it's that the counter seats were uncomfortable. There was something jutting out in the centre of the seat which made it uncomfortable to get onto and sit. It's also a little pricy if ordered ala carte as the portions are not very big for the price
4
This place is great. It has a really good feel to it and serves wonderful little tapas creations in addition to the usual standard fare. My wife and I tried the baby squid (good), beetroot (insane), burgers (really good), octopus (really good) and a few others - can't recall after too much sangria. Will be back to try the rest of the menu
5
The food was sumptuous and the service was superb. Excellent food presentation. The ambience was a great experience and it makes the dinner more interesting by sitting at the bar able to see the great chefs in their element. A great place to enjoy great food with family and friends! A place that I will definitely go back for more!
5
Food was beautifully plated! Both delightful to the eyes and the taste buds! Slightly disappointed with the cod main though. It didn't deliver or pack a punch like the rest of the dishes.The crew was also very kind to serve my son a dessert of his own at absolutely no charge
4
The food is very nice, portion is good for me too, not eating too much yet filling. I should keep some room for dessert next time!
5
Great food , atmosphere, service food and tart! Will come back. Everyone had a good time. Kudos to everyone
4
Good food and service. As usual, tapas are quite expensive and here more than usual. Food is good but the bills comes quite expensive with only few dishes on the table. nice place for dates if you sit outside.
5
This was my second time dining at esquina. As with the last time, service was excellent and the food amazing. The grilled octopus has got to the best in Singapore.
4
Spanish Tapas with a slight oriental infusion , which is a delight. The Chope special 9 course menu is value for money.
5
Friendly staffs and chefs. Delicious food. Wonderful tapas dining experience. The Grilled Octopus is a must-try as it's so yummy!
4
Fair price, good food, service is good as well. The only thing I don't like properly is the music during dining.
4
Solid cooking. Nothing spectacular, but everything very enjoyable. Portion sizes were generous. We had the set menu and walked out feeling really quite full.
4
Overall a nice experience, very knowledgeable and helpful staff, food was great. I was surprised that a place tuck right at the corner offer a rather interesting experience, I wished I was seated downstairs to see the action.
4
I just loved sitting at the bar and watching the action and food moving efficiently out. Best way to decide what you want and the food looked good. Talented chef with some different combinations and textures delivered at a high level consistently. What more can you ask for except maybe a bargain price but that's unrealistic. We arrived at 8:30pm without reservations and did get seated immediately in front of the chef so no complaints there. The food was good modern Tapas style and looked and tasted great. Service was brisk but not rushed. The staff explained everything as it arrived and portions were a good size. Price was not cheap but not outrageous either. Loved the decor. Go.....Try.....Have Fun...
5
The food was great, and we had very attentive and friendly service from the floor staff. Enjoyed sitting at the bar counter, gazing in awe while the chefs prepares our food.
5
Great food, good service.. food was delicious as always. Celebrated our birthdays there. Will visit again!
5
Quaint tapas. Very popular. Loved the beetroot, cauliflower, suckling pig, bred in cannelloni. Wi return.
4
I mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday and they prepared a very yummy choc cake to serve us at the end. Food was good and portions perfect for us (one on diet and one a light eater).
2
We've actually been waiting first to be seated even though we have made a reservation and second it took 25 minutes to have two cañas served. We ordered a couple of tapas that we didn't try because we decided to leave. At least they didn't charge for the cañas. Too many people behind the counter and yet the tapas are prepared one by one, too slow. Tiny detail, the seats at the counter aren't very comfortable either. I really hope it was just a bad day. I was told it was a good on
4
a few years ago, my wife and I were regular Esquina visitors, and always had a great experience. Following the departure of Andrew we hoped that things would not change too much, however on our first visit under a new chef we were very disappointed and with so many choices available in Singapore, Esquina sadly fell from our regular list.Now 12mths or so later we decided to see if our old favourite was back on par.Under chef Carlos it seems that Esquina has found its way again. The ambience and atmosphere is still there, attentive staff as always and the enjoyment of watching your food being cooked in front of you remains. There seems a subtle shift in mood and if anything it is a bit more relaxed there and the food speaks for itself again. With enough variety to please the majority of palates, the dishes stamp a new identity on the place. There are still some old favourites but the new dishes we tried were equally as good and, we're happy to say that Esquina will be back on our favourites list agai
5
Great food, good and reasonably priced wine. I really enjoy sitting at the bar watching the action in the kitchen. The menu has a lot of variety and I love the dishes with foie gras and truffle. Haven't had a dish that I didn't love. Go with a few people and order a bunch of dishes to share.
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Service, quality of food and ambiance are all fantastic
3
I had for a long time wanted to give Esquina a try. I finally did this past weekend, but I must say that I was a little underwhelmed. Do not get me wrong, the food was not bad; it just was not great. Perhaps, after (such) a long time coming, I just had misplaced high expectations. This might sound a little harsh, but I must say that I feel the dishes could use a little more creativity with ingredient pairing and flavours. It just felt like most of the dishes needed a little something more. Perhaps, it just was not a great night in the kitchen.
3
Had dinner here a few days back after looking up for spanish food choices on Tripadvisor. There is both outdoor and indoor (by the bar seating), though personally, I felt that the outdoor seating were a little too low for comfort. Crowd here were mainly foreigners, probably expats working around the area. Food menu choice here is categorised into snacks, sea, soil, land and dessert. Do take note that the sea, soil and land are not main course and are Tapas style, and will probably be better for sharing. Had the oysters, octopus and the paella. The oysters was pretty impressive, and the specially created sauce was something to die for. The octopus was great as well, with the large tentacles grilled to perfection. The paella wasn't a slight let down. Overall, Esquina do really put in a great deal of effort in presentation and the food was pretty impressive.Slight blemish from the otherwise excellent experience here was the constant pressure from the servers to quickly finish our food and our drinks. Perhaps it was due to the limited seating, but we felt a little upset to be presented the bill right after our final tapas was completed though we still had half of our drinks not yet finished (around 9pm). Perhaps they were trying to squeeze in 3 seatings in one night? Overall, i spent around $65 per person for a 3 course tapas and a beer. Would still recommend this place for the awesome food, but probably for a quick bite (maybe lunch?).
5
We had the set lunch here. Food was really pleasant and surprising . Food Service was efficient and professional . Great office day lunch.
5
I do enjoy, watching people work, especially when they are creating great plates of food for me to eat.If you can get the centre seats**, where he is plating up then you get a great appreciation for the attention to detail that goes into every plate that leaves the pass.Chef Carlos looks far too young to be a head chef but that is maybe just a reflection of that fact I am getting much older....! Very consistent restaurant and one that continues to evolve the menu, so you can always try something new on the each visit.** I mentioned the seats, love the bar type set up but the seats are certainly not the most comfortable you will ever sit on.
4
I am a big fan of its sister restaurant in Shanghai and thought I should give this a try while I am in Singapore. The food did not disappoint. Our favorite was the paella which was crusty and packed full of flavor. The grilled octopus was great too. Service was averag. Waiter was very helpful but knowledge of wine was very limited. The outdoor sitting was cramp. They can do with bigger mist fans to cool down the tropic heat. Portions are a bit small even when compared to its sister restaurant in Shangha
5
Sat at the bar this time and the energy is so different than from upstairs. If you want a quiet dateNight definitely ask for the tables upstairs. If you just want to hang with friends, sit at the counter and lap it all in. As usual the food was excellent
3
When we arrived, the guy on the door actually did not care that we had a reservation for inside,mhe said that it doesn't matter, its where ever is space and went outside with us. However the table which he wanted to seat us was occupied by people which wanted to move inside at first but than decided to stay outside, so we went in again and got squeezed in the corner. Food was ok, nothing to write home about, portions very small and therefore not a good price value. The octopus is max a60 gr. Portion and its a main course. It was our second time because we enjoyed the first time, but we will not return. To many other good places in Singapore.
3
Very cool restaurant/bar with a nice cosy restaurant feel upstairs and a tapas bar vibe downstairs. Overall it was an enjoyable experience but the food was mixed. From the snacks, the ham and tomato bread and the oysters were delicious but the bacalao and the crispy baby squid were a disappointment. Not too much taste in the bacalao and didn't really taste the chili and not sure what the squid ink added to the aioli in the crispy squid dish. I liked the croqueta but some of the other guests found it a bit salty. From the Sea, the scallops were disappointing but the grilled squid was good and the salt cod was delicious. In the Land segment, the beef and pork cannelloni tasted mainly of the foie gras which was also seemed to be the over-riding texture. The suckling pig meat was deliciously tender and worked very well with the chutney but the skin was a bit chewy rather than crisp and felt that the mulled wine jus was overpowering when eaten with the rest of the dish. Desserts also mixed, the chocolate fondant was amazing but the banana and beer ice cream dessert was only OK. We had a very nice rioja, some cava and a glass of tempranillo and I agree with some comments that drinks are expensive but then, it is Singapore!!! But thank you for a very pleasant evening with very good but unobtrusive service
5
Esquina is definitely a go to place for a great night out. We had the oysters which were succulent and deliciously prepared and came with a glass of Cava. The suckling pig was very tender and accompanied by a great rhubarb and Apple chutney - highly recommend this if you eat here! The service staff were very attentive and friendly, overall a really enjoyable experience
3
Food and drinks were average. Croquette was only slightly warm, giving the impression that it had been laying around for a bit before being served. Generally the food was acceptable, however portions were small and overall the taste was underwhelming. We ordered raw scallops, onion bread, a tiny piece of cod and the suckling pig. Also, a bottle of red wine at $95, but have had better for half or even a third of the price. The place seems very popular with expats

The food quality was superb, staff were exceptional in explaining each dish and extremely friendly. Try and get a seat at the bar so you can watch them prepare each dish at the open kitchen. Be warned tho, its not cheap for the sizes of the plates but you wont feel so bad once your stomach is bursting at the seams unlike your bank account which may have drained your child's education fund

Food was ok but too expensive for such small portions! Fois gras terrine was not tasty and so small that even my cat would feel like starving after eating it.Worst of all was the quality of the Spanish wine. Just terrible. SGD90 for a wine tasting like cooking wine or table wine at best.Never we will be back to such a place. Typical Singapore scam, far from what you would experience in Spain but 3 times more expensive.

Finally we got the chance to try Esquina! And the long wait was truly worth it! We LOVE the food, the service, the ambience and we would plan to return soon, because we want to order everything on their menu! Tapas bar at it's BEST with Value for Money for lunch! You can get a generous set lunch for SGD38! Sitting at the bar, watching the chefs work is an entertainment by itself... Service was amazing - Myra is very friendly and informative... If you are travelling to Singapore, book Esquina... You wont regret it ..

Chef Carlos and his team produce excellent cuisine. My favourite being the saffron paella with pan fried red snapper, peas and chorizo and he pickled beetroot with whipped truffle burrata, raspberries and smoked walnuts. The staff are fantastic and the music adds to the ambianc

Very welcoming when we step in. We took the SG51 tasting menu and portion was just nice. Excellent service, food and drinks

My Husband and I had dinner this evening. The food really was delicious, inventive and beautifully presented. Each dish was really pretty exceptional. Sadly the service was poor.We had to ask for our order to be taken after at least 20 'mins. Dirty plates were not cleared. No second round of drinks offered. We had to ask to order more drinks. We had to ask to order desert, and when we did they still did not clear away our mains plates. We will be back because the food is exceptionally good but next time please improve the service. It was really very poor! And at a restaurant like this the service should be as good as the food. Disappointing
5
Our last night in Singapore our friends took my partner and I to Esquina as we love tapas and it was fantatstic! Food was sensational and Jeff, our waiter, was fantastic. Very friendly and he knew all the dishes very well. Great place, worth a try
4
Dropped the girls off after dinner and came here for drinks with wife. Arrived around 9:30pm and the place was packed but the energy was high. We managed to squeeze in a side table by the window. Order a pint of Estrella beer and Manzanna Fizz. Had half dozens Tsarskaya Oysters, crispy baby squid and two Iberico croquettes. Good experience and great service
4
We had a great time at the 2nd floor level of Esquina and everything was delicious. Only disappointment was the suckling pig as the skin was tough and chewy instead of crispy. But otherwise, everything else was just great
3
My wife & I spent $250 for a bottle of Argentinian table wine and 5 very small plates of good, but not great, food. Don't believe the hype, there's nothing special about Esquin
4
We had a great evening at the esquina. Sitting at the bar we could follow every step of the preparation of our food by the chef. What a great experience. Very outstanding combinations of ingredients and a great presentation of the food on the plates
5
Esquina is such a lovely restaurant. The food is exquisite. Between two of us we always have three starters and one main and it is the perfect amount. The iberica ham is fantastic. The best I have had outside of Spain. The cauliflower is incredible (yes cauliflower!!). The suckling pig is heavenly and the squid is also really, really good. The service is so attentive and the wine list compliments the menu beautifully. All in all a fantastic little place
5
Really a perfect after-work spot in the lovely Keong Saik district (in days of yore a gritty red light area, now a delightful warren of interesting restaurants). A generous by-the-glass wine list, strong-ish sangria, and a moreish food menu - particular standouts were the pulled pork and foie gras burgers, and raw scallops. Upstairs seating for intimate chats, otherwise the bar counter places are buzzy and fun. Only quibble - portions aren't the largest for the prices. Great with colleagues/ friends.
5
Excellent service. Went there for a birthday celebration. Was here last year for the first time and nothing changed. Food was as delicious as how I remembered it and service as meticulous and thoughtful. Make sure you go for the fried baby squids and order their special onion and thyme bread with bone marrow butter. YUM! Also, thank you for the slice of cake you arranged for the birthday boy! =
4
Just stopped the night in Singapore on our way to Cambodia but after eating here for the first time on a previous stay just had to visit again. Different chef this time but same quality food and great service. Will always visit when we get the chance
4
Had an awesome dinner here, food was tasty and was served very fast which was very appreciated! Our server, Kareen, was great! She was very attentive and had good knowledge of the menu! Great experience overall
5
More i visit Esquina the more i love that place.The hospitality is amazing and Young chef Carlos is very talented.Best is to oder several dishes and you share.Presentation is awesome, taste refine.
3
Compared to Esquina when it was first opened a few years ago, the food quality has gone from excellent to average. The most disappointing dish was the cod fish. It was not served fresh. We told the waiter but nothing was done beyond that. Unlikely to go back ever again.
5
A sensational night of food and entertainment was had at Esquina. This is a must visit on any trip to Singapore. Nestled in a tiny street in China town this Tapas bar packs a punch! Mateo the chef prepares everything in front of you witg understated charm and precision. It is a spectacle to be seen! The food is absolutely delicious we ate the cauliflower, beetroot, beef and paella! All yum yum yum! The cocktails were also beyond delicious! Don't miss this great place on your travels! Gracie's Mateo and Esquina!
5
A friend recommended Esquina and we weren't disappointed. Everything we chose - both the specials and main menu were great. Excellent combination of flavours. My 13 year old voted it the best meal of our holiday
4
My first dinning experience at this little quaint corner of the street at this Spanish tapas bar! It is by far the best Spanish tapas bar that I have tried in Singapore. Spanish tapas lover and Esquina is a must try!
4
The food and ambiance were nice but the experience could have been improved by more guidance on the menu / what to choose when / sequence of food. They should offer a tasting menu. Also there was a bit too much oil on some of the dishes, which made them a bit difficult to eat. Overall good, but a few small improvements could make it a lot better. Also - the fans are a bit aggressive
4
The location is very good and convenient. The food is good also. We like the crispy pork( should be baby pig?) very much.
5
My wife and I neede a break after work. We choose Esquina as we love good food.It was so good to see the professionalism of their team.I especially liked the squid.It was worth every cent of the s$200 we paid.See you soon. And thank
4
Delicious food and really enjoyed watching it be cooked. It was reasonably good value and attentive service.
5
Had dinner for two last week up on the second floor. It was one of the best meals we've enjoyed in Singapore during our three years of living here. Service was attentive without being intrusive. SGD $ 190 for dinner for two (five savory plates, two dessert plates, and drinks). We don't mind the splurge if we get our money's worth, which we certainly did on this occasion. It's quality here, not outrageous quantity. Our guess is that Esquina will be in the running for a Michelin star
4
The food was fantastic. Prawns, Lettuce, Paella where wonderful. Presentation lovely. Service was spot on.But.. both my wife and I were extremely thirsty after the meal and absolutely parched the next morning. I'm pretty sure they don't put MSG. Maybe a bit heavy handed on the salt? We didn't eat anywhere else that night. Not sure if anyone else haso experienced this.
4
Overall we had a great meal at Esquina. The food was innovative at times and almost everything we ordered tasted very good. In particular the lemon thyme bread with bone marrow butter, the grilled Spanish octopus, the Spanish omelette (which was a really small portion but absolutely delicious) and the Spanish nigiri - cod with a bell pepper on top. Again very tasty. The portions are small, so unlike other restaurants that serve tapas you will need to pay a lot to enjoy many portions of something you like. But it's definitely worth one visit to experience something new with Spanish tapas
3
Went here for a birthday dinner with friends, the food was very good, but came in laughably small quantities for the price. I enjoyed the place and we were well looked after, but the experience was overshadowed by the bill ($5pp for water when I asked for tap water was a final kick in the pants). Might be nice for a pair on a romantic date, but wasn't worthwhile for a large group
5
It was my first time here, especially on a quiet Monday night with some guests sitting by the bar counter. It was an open kitchen concept where we got to observe the bustling activity of the chefs at work. I had several dishes consisting of the oysters, mini spanish breakfast, sea urchin with crab and the cannelloni and a few others. The warm onion and thyme bread was worth mentioning and trying. I loved the texture and bone marrow butter that came with it. The oyster was fantastic with its refreshing, glide-down-the-throat texture. The cannelloni could get slightly too 'jelak' but could be more refined to improve on its taste!The service was friendly and helpful, which was a plus point. Overall, it was still a full-filling meal at Esquina
4
Great food, great venue, great staff! The set lunchtime menu is great value for money! Will definitely make a return visit in the evening
5
Brought my Spanish friends there. They thought the food was excellent. It was a little on the pricey side but well worth i
4
the food in Esquina is fantastic!we have visited this restaurant about 10 times and always felt very welcome. this time we visited with a friend from overseas and to be sure to have the seats we wanted (corner of the bar) we made reservatons more tan a week n advance.we hadto wait about 45 minutes before we got seated.and found out that they had given "our" requested seats to other people! I think the music was too loud
5
Love this place, very casual with great music (anything blues, rock, etc) and outstanding food. Definitely not the place to bring the in-laws, but a place to let your hair down and enjoy fantastic food with friends at the bar counter.
4
Watching Carlos and crew work was brilliant and Kareen's service was impeccable but genuinely friendly. Excellent starters followed by beautiful salt cod and pidgeon. We will be back to experience the rest of the menu
5
Carlos, muchas gracias por las buenos comidas. You are taking tapas to a new level and yet we recognized the Catalan heritage. Glad we made it all the way to dessert as that was superb too. Lots arguments about the best dish..... but for me no debate it had to be the sucking pig!
3
Dishes weren't particularly bad, but none stood out enough to have me come back. Ordered the Spanish nigiri, oysters, Spanish omelette, peppers,urchin foam, octopus, beef and pork cannelloni, paella, and cauliflower. Thought the cauliflower, paella, & octopus were executed well but the rest of the dishes were trying a little too hard. We might have ordered the wrong items though, we had asked the waitstaff for their recommendations but the cannelloni didn't amaze us
5
We were seated at the bar and it was mesmerizing to watch the team work! The food is equally as amazing, made to perfection. So much care put into every dish, it screams passion for cooking. Can't say enough about the service. Everyone was attentive and extremely knowledgeable. We ordered to share the baby squid, grilled baby romaine lettuce, a prawn special of the day and the best of it all - the beef ribeye with charred leeks, romesco. Still talking about it months later. A must to return. Tip: Book ahead to avoid waiting for table. Request for seat at the bar
2
Average food with terrible service. Had to wait 20min for our drinks after we had ordered them. This place was definitely over hyped! Very disappointed after having heard about this place for so Long.
5
Great atmosphere, excellent service and most importantly brilliant food. The grilled octopus is especially amazing and if I would receive it in a michelin star restaurant, I would be very pleased
5
We ate at the bar overlooking the kitchen and was interesting to see the chefs at work. The Head Chef reviews every dish to leave the kitchen no wonder the dishes taste so good. We had oysters, cauliflower, snapper paella, sardines, octopus and more. Service was friendly and professional, great ambience. In a lively area with cool bars for a pre or post dinner drink. Highly recommend Esquina!
5
Great service. Interesting and delicious food. One of the best European inspired restaurants in Singapore. Creative menu and good place to eat and catch up with friends
4
One of the best foods I have had in a while. The wine list is expensive and limited but worth it. The oysters, baby octopus and burgers are amazing
5
Had another great meal at Esquina. Sat upstairs which lacks the atmosphere of the counter, but food was superb. Many places try to cook this classy tapas style and fail
5
Fantastic service with thoughtful recommendations, amazingly delicious food (great variety), and eye catching eclectic ambiance that enhanced the dining experience. Was my first visit, and wont be my last!
5
What a great restaurant. One of the few places that actually exceeded my already high expectations. The dishes were mouth-wateringly good, the ambience relaxed and friendly. There was enough variety on the menu to satisfy most tastebuds and significantly for Singapore, really outstanding service. I can't wait to go back
5
Highly recommended with great food and superb service. Bar counter is where all the actions are. Really enjoyed the experience..
5
Service was nearly flawless except that the courses came a bit too rushed at first, but we did ask them to slow down and it was better. Food was impeccably done, with my favourite to be the Grilled Octopus and Braised Beef & Pork Cannelloni. The chef also gave us a plate of dessert on the house -- Chocolate Ganache on Toast with Olive Oil Caviar and Sea Salt -- which gave us orgasm in the mouth. Definitely worth every cent spent
4
Came here with two other girlfriends on a weekday for dinner and it was very quiet. The dining area is relatively small, so reservations on weekends are probably a must. They also have outdoor seating by the roadside which did not seem that pleasant (dark and hot and by the road where people will walk pass you) so do take note when you make reservations. Food was overall not bad, wouldn't say its the best but definitely above average. Appetizers and mains were good. We ordered some croquettes, the roasted cauliflower, paella and the suckling pig special that night. Dessert unfortunately was just average (for the price paid). We ordered the BBC which came highly recommended, and while the beer ice cream was interesting, it was literally a scoop of ice cream with some caramelized bananas for $15. Service was good overall, we were not chased out of the restaurant (or made to feel that we had to leave) and finally left around 930pm. Would be back for the appetizers and mains but will probably skip dessert
4
Came in with my friends on a casual Thursday night, the restaurant was fully booked but the lady managed to get us a table. Really creative tapas! We ordered the Pedron peppers, paella & ribeyes. All were cooked to perfect, well balance flavour and I couldn't ask for more. Customer services are very attentive and the staff also spend sometime to explain to us the special of the day before she takes our orders. Came back to check on us whether we like the food between meals which I find this is how the restaurant took their food seriously. The servers even explained the dishes when they served the food. No complaints and will definitely come back again :
4
We ordered 4 dishes and 1 desert, each of them surprised us with creative ingredients, such as the roasted pig ( the skin was to die for) with red ruby sauce -- it created a surprising pastry-like favor yet with fruity sweetness from red ruby. Will definitely come back for more. But one thing I didn't quite enjoy was the sitting -- we changed 3 sitting as most seats were high stools, eventually we settled at low stools outdoor but the stools were not too comfortable either. Hope they could do more about sitting
1
Had always wanted to stop by for more than a drink, as I expected this would be a great addition to the Singapore dining scene.Couldn't be more wrong. The only thing they get right is the size of the portions, which is smaller than normal tapas, leaving our group hungry and wondering why we dropped $300 in this place.The only good plate was a $15 cheese plate with 4 slices of Manchego and toast which was very decent. (not on the menu)Their Bacalao was tasteless and mushy. The Omelette (tortilla espanola) was ridiculously small and somebody definitely did not teach this chef how to fluff a tortilla, the size of a big coin! The beef canelloni was so heavy, nobody in the party could have more than one bite (It was $30!!!! for one canelloni!). $6 for a croqueta?Not a single dish stood out... I really hope places like these go out of business and we finally get a real tapas experience in Singapore, not a ripoff like this
4
Delicious tapas dishes @ exquisite Esquina. Simple ingredients with bust of flavours. Nice ambience, as well as good service. Gracias!
5
Went to Esquina for an anniversary and the food was excellent, great to be sat right in front of the chef as well watching them work.
5
Pleasant surprise and both my guest and i were enjoyed the ambiance, food and service. Five stars and a revisit is being planned this year. Thank you for making it a great evening for us.
5
Exquisite tapas, refined and flavorful. Each bite is a delicious explosion of flavours and textures!
We were sitting at the bar counter and could observe the chefs and the team preparing the food, it was fun and entertaining.
A must in Singapore!
5
Because it's delicious, That's why. We got the tasting menu. The first course was the most beautiful oyster I have ever had. The fanciful mignonette with tasted superb. I love to watch chefs work so we sat at the bar and loved the show.
4
This place has been around for 2-3 years and it's my 1st time here. Smallish with counter seats on ground floor, outdoor seats on ground floor and table seating upstairs . I had the counter seats so you can see the action of the kitchen. The counter seats were small and not too comfortable though The menu has starters, vegetables , meat and dessert. There are also daily specials . I must say most of the dishes were tasty. My favorites were the grilled romaine, paella with snapper, and mashmallow dessert. All beautifully plated Service is good throughout It's not too cheap though, about $120 per pax including 1 glass of wine
5
I took my flatmate here for his birthday, knowing that it is always a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. We ordered the oysters, calamari, grilled octopus, and beef cheek special. The oysters were so delicious with pickled ginger flowers that we immediate tried to figure out how we could replicate it and make 2 dozen at home! Everything was perfect but after a long day we were both still a bit hungry so we added on a Paella. When it came out the chef sent it back and asked his cook to start again as it wasn't up to his standards... Which firstly I thought was refreshing in Singapore where service can be lackluster. Secondly he treated us to two dishes, the Spanish Nigiri and the Spanish omelette as we waited. Both were unique dishes and the omelette had a delicate crispy bread below it, and wasn't at all like a Spanish tortilla as I expected. When the Paella arrived it was perfectly done with lovely crunchy rice bits and a tender fish and squid on top. As if we could have loved them more, we were treated to a birthday toast and small chocolate care for my friend. This was my third time at Esquina and I plan to go back next time I have a special event. Thanks Esquina

We went there tonight, for a joint anniversary, birthday with friends.It is essentially a tapas bar, with a decent sampling of tapas, although essentially no vegetarian options.The food is tasty, try the pork knuckle and the beef cheeks, but very overpriced. We walked out with a $600 bill and still hungry
5
Unusual restaurant great menu and good advise from staff. We changed our reservation to sit at the bar and watch the dishes being prepared would say that is a must for smaller groups fascinating and very atmospheric. The highlight thou is the food which is superb, if there is one dish as a stand out option then do try the beef cheeks, so good we ordered them twice...
5
We came here for a team dinner and booked a table upstairs. It was a lovely space, good atmosphere and the service was quick and unobtrusive. The wine selection was lovely and the food was very lovely. We particularly liked the Pork belly (we got another portion), the sliders and the scallops
5
Great evening once again with impeccable service from the team at Esquina. Chef runs a great kitchen and is preparing everything right in front of you at the counter.Good wines to keep you lubricated.
5
Consistently one of the best European restaurants in Singapore.
Table at the bar counter is best to view chefs in action.
Wine list is small - cld do with more choice by the glass.
5
Living up to the JASON atherton branding with great tapas . Good value and service staff are knowledgeable.

Outram MRT Station. Short 5 - 10 min walk. We took a cab.First time here. Overall a really good experience.Helmed by a new chef from Spain, Carlos. We had the pleasure of sitting by the bar area and watched him / his team in action. Pleasantly surprised that he tasted every single dish before serving it.We had 2 glasses of wine each, 4 tapas in total and the bill came up to about SGD200 which I thought was a tad pricey (only to realise they overcharged us for one extra glass of wine which we never consumed). So remember to look at your final bill before leaving.Try the roasted cauliflower with Manchego cheese and ham dish - to die for! Never knew that this humble vegetable (so tasteless and bland) could actually be transformed into something so delectable and flavourful. Its on the main menu so no worries about it being off the list for any reason. Try also the Beetroot pickled dish (also on the main menu) - this slightly sour pickle-like taste goes very well with the roasted cauliflower and breaks up the "richness" of the Manchego cheese.Food wise, we could not complain and the service staff do their best to please, a friendly atmosphere and they make it a point to offer suggestions. However, we felt that the selection of wines were not as complementary or on par in bringing out the flavours of the food. In short, we felt the wines didn't do the food justice.Advance reservations are required as the place is small and packed by 8pm. Ask for a seat inside at the bar counter (center seats in front of the chefs please!) and watch Carlos, the Executive Chef and his team transform the food right in front of your eyes.The Chefs do their best to interact with the diners too (without too much disruption to their work), and gave complementary servings of dessert (similar to palate cleaners) to some of the diners which I thought was a nice touch.Overall, a really good experience.Adeline LeeDinner / Drinks with another guestFebruary 201

Food was great! I visited when the new young Chef from Barcelona had just taken the position for several weeks, but the improvement in the menu was evident. I usually prefer my oysters sans mignonette, but the one offered here with jalapeno ponzu, saklmon roe and ginger flower was great. Bacalao brandade made with salted cod, potato, garlic oil and piquillo pepper on top has unexpected texture. It was so airy. breakfast cup of mushroom puree, potato foam and scrambled egg and chorizo crumble is a bit tiring, as this kind of egg are ubiquitous in SG dining scene nowadays. Octopus was amazing - highlight of the dinner. Basil berries marshmallow ends the dinner with refreshing touch.Overall, a lovely place, good quality, correct price, nice to see Chef and team calmly preparing food despite the packed place. We were not being rushed despite Friday night dinner, the only complaint was the seat on the bar.. I think many other reviewers have mentioned this as well, it is oh so not comfortable
4
Our experience was good, as we found the quality of food and service to be excellent, however, the quantity compare to the price of items is quite high. A paella of $24 which is excellent in taste should be larger than 3/4 cup of food. The dessert also, at $15 dollars should be larger. We can enjoy nice food but we would also appreciate more
4
I must say, coming back to Esquina was the best dining decision I had made till date, as of 2016! The food was fantastic, presentation was beautiful and the ambience was lovely. The only set back was that service that night was slightly disappointing. The service crew wasn't very attentive. Then again, we were seated @ Lvl 2 and there were only 2-3 crew who were allocated to handle the completely full Lvl 2 so, the lack of attentiveness could easily be overlooked. All in all, the quality of food, presentation, ambience & service certainly justifies for the prices. If possible do request for counter seats! That's were all the actions are!
4
Watching the food being prepared was a highlight, but the downside is a lack of privacy and opportunity to talk to your fellow diner. I felt (especially during quieter times) under the spotlight to gush over how spectacularly amazing the food was; it was... very good. Additionally, the waiter could not wait to take away our plates away even before finishing the last mouthful. Just 30 seconds more would have made all the difference and offered a more relaxed dining experience
5
This was our second visit, first for dinner. We love sitting at the bar counter and watching all the dishes being created. Really makes you want to try every one or at least plan what to eat on your next visit. Outstanding dishes are the roasted cauliflower and you can't really go wrong with smoked bone marrow butter. Another huge plus for this city is that service here is right on the ball. Can't wait to return and soon
4
Great food. Lovely staff. A little loud for my liking but otherwise very good. Watch the stairs coming down from level 2, staff advised many people fall as the second step has an issue. It produced a less than graceful exit but I was lucky it wasn't more serious
5
Ideal scenario is a seat on the bar with the chefs explaining you the variety of delectable dishes accompanied by your favorite food buddy and a critical palate for anything that yummy. Surprising and balanced experience! Well worth it.
5
Excellent as always. the special of beef and pork cannelloni with shaved truffles was awesome. Great service from Chef Carlos and his team in front of us at the counter cooking and Myra, Karen and the rest of the wait staff. Loved the music!!!
5
A great evening at the counter with attentive service and watching the chefs making the food in front of us. Excellent menu and great experience. I will be back.
4
Always enjoy the food and service here. Staff very interactive and personable.
Choice for wine by glass is only one and can be improved to at least 2 types.
5
The open kitchen & counter seats reminded me of Momofuko Ko in NYC. Highly recommend this restaurant. We had loads of small plates for sharing. All were great.
5
Probably one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in Singapore! All the dishes were cooked to perfection, the friendliest staff who can actually advise you properly on dishes and wines, good location!
5
Given the counter layout you need to take clients here that you know well. The food and ambience is superb - tapas style so you can try 6 or 8 plates - great interaction with the chefs and front of house team. I'm back there this Friday ! Looking forward..
5
Esquina is small, but perfectly formed. The restaurant is on a corner lot in a lovely old building, with some outdoor seating, a small bar area and dining areas on the ground and first floor. The decor is probably best described as urban shabby chic, with lots of old product posters, creative lighting, and a warm ambience. The unisex loo tickled me - I'm still trying to work out if the red neon lighting on the ceiling is a compliment or a request - "Good Aim" or "Aim Good"? It's a fairly casual venue, but the food takes it to a different level.My friends and I were visiting to celebrate a birthday, and the 6 of us were given a table upstairs. It was late and we were starving, so we quickly ordered almost every item on the tapas menu - there's a wonderful variety. Service was prompt, cheerful and knowledgeable, and our orders began arriving almost immediately. Everything was utterly delicious, and we had to remind ourselves that we had more dishes en route, to restrain from ordering too much. My friend, however, couldn't resist placing a second order for the truly amazing sardines. Personally, I adored the pigeon - succulent, perfectly cooked, completely scrumptious. It was all so good that we asked if we could meet the chef, Carlos Montobbio, to give him our compliments for such a wonderful meal; he very kindly came to our table once the evening rush had subsided. Carlos was very passionate about Equinas - though the superb food was already testament his enthusiasm - and he was completely charming, asking all of us about the food, and for our opinions. It's clear that he's determined to make Equinas the best it can be. The additional surprise goodies he sent out for the birthday girl were immensely appreciated, and made her - and our - night very special. We finished the evening with coffee on the patio, feeling full, happy, and determined to return.I would highly recommend Equinas - fantastic service, astounding food, welcoming decor. Do visit and enjoy
5
Sit at the bar to truly appreciate the passion, skill & ATD Carlos & his team inject into every dish. The flavour & creativity of the food at Esquina is word class! I wanted to return after my 1st visit 7 months ago & was impressed that Friday's dinner was even better. We kicked off our meal with 5 Snacks, with standouts the Spanish omelette, Spanish nigiri, thyme bread with bone marrow butter, & our fave of crispy baby squid with squid-ink aioli. Our 2 mains were the Sardines with Samfaina (best sardines I've every had, anywhere) & the grilled octopus which never disappoints. The service is always good & attentive. Wine list modest but passable. Add Esquina to your must-done list, book well ahead, & book the bar area to watch the show ...
5
I took my wife to Esquina for our wedding anniversary dinner, after hosting a work drinks party there and being impressed by the atmosphere and friendly staff. The food was extremely original, beautifully presented and without exception delicious. Particularly notable for me were the beetroot, burrata and truffle tapas and the pigeon with rosemary polenta and raspberries - great cooking, and a very enjoyable evening, including a surprise pudding with Happy Anniversary! written across it, which was a thoughtful touch. Highly recommended - we did think it might have been more lively if we had chosen to sit at the bar rather than upstairs, but both are good fun
5
Dined here last night and it was fantastic. Every dish we ordered was of the highest standard and the service was 10/10. I would go as far as to say it's the best food/dining experience I have had in Singapore. Can't wait to return
4
Overall pretty interesting to see the chef play with the food and had some great dishes but some "decent" dishes. No bad ones but seems that the main course are still tapas portions so not sure why the main is there?
4
Fourth time to the restaurant, first time making a reservation before going.
Food is good as usual, friendly staffs.
4
Good food, had their sea urchin , paella, fried baby squid, thyme bred with smoke bine marrow butter. Love the food there. friendly staff, they recommend us with food n wine.
4
Esquina continues to please and surprise. Anything done in the Jasper oven is a must-try. The prawns and octopus in particular were to die for! Watching the team navigate in the narrow galley kitchen and churn out the amazing food that they do is sheer entertainment. What can I say, I'm a fan
5
I had the pleasure of having a business lunch at this restaurant, and what a pleasant surprise. From the quarky bar stols from stoddard to the friendly staff. Sitting and eating in full contact with the kitchen watching the food being prepared made it a more personal experience. The Spanish tapas served worked beautifully with the recommended while, thanks to knowledgeable staff. Good value for money
5
My partner and I had our anniversary dinner here and the food and service were amazing! We got a seat at the end of the bar and were attended to excellently all night by the front house and kitchen. Will definitely go back and order the cod :
5
Why we love it: We've been a patron of this brilliant establishment since it first opened, and the dishes are consistently creative and amazingly scrumptious. We had the starter specials for the day, then followed by Padron peppers, ponzu dressing, Crispy baby squid chilli coriander squid ink aioli, Chorizo croquetas, piquillo mayo and a pork belly dish.The staff service has also greatly improved! They are much more pleasant and always smiling as well as offering a more efficient service. It used to be that the maitre d' was an arrogant woman and the staff treated the patrons like they were at their mercy.It's not cheap or mid-priced, but it's certainly worth it - the ambience, the crowd and the location all adds to it's charm

The menu changed slightly and the dishes still taste great. With ample seating upstairs if you prefer dining at tables. For me, my fave corner is at the bar counter nearer to the bar-tender s it feels like we are chatting and interteracting with those around - typical tapas atmosphere where you can see what they order and vice versa and we toast our drinks around

My fiancÃ© booked Esquina on Tuesday night for my birthday. On arrival we were immediately greeted by a friendly host and seated at the bar downstairs. Now I appreciate bar seating isn't everyone's cup of tea but we loved it and I think it works well in this setting. From our seats we could see everything that was going on in the open kitchen, check out the dishes going out (and change our minds endlessly about what we wanted- it all looked so good!) and soak up the buzzing atmosphere. Apparently there is table seating available upstairs which maybe better for larger groups.We were immediately offered drinks and presented with a comprehensive wine list before being given some time to choose what we wanted to eat.Esquina is a tapas restaurant so dishes are sight my smaller than the standard. There were plenty of options on the menu at different price points though, including a whole section of 'snacks' priced at around $7 which we could have quite happily worked our way through and left it that. There was no pressure to order a certain amount of dishes or from a certain section of the menu. In fact what was no delightful about Esquina was that we could order as much or as little at a time and then see how we felt. We ended up sharing two smaller 'snacks', two larger dishes and a dessert and found that to be plenty for two (and my other half eats a lot!). Every dish was utterly delicious (with the red snapper paella being a particular highlight!). The service was excellent across the board. All the staff were attentive and friendly and looked like they cared that you were having a good time.Our bill came to around $200 including a glass of bubbly and a bottle of wine which in Singapore I felt was extremely reasonable. Overall an excellent experience and we will definitely be back!

A great place for friends, couples, business lunches/dinners. Great food, wine, service and atmosphere.
4
The description of the dishes on the menu sound ordinary, but the food taste delicious. I suppose you have to trust that Jason Atherton's food will be good - and it is!
5
Very nice restaurant on a great location for Thu/Fri nights out. Inside as well as outside space. Food is of great quality and service is excellent. Very enjoyable experience.
5
Awesome food, awesome service, awesome food! Really delightful set menu - good value for awesome food
2
This place has a great concept, but overrated and obviously some have much lower standard of rating. Portion sizes are over priced. Alcoholic drinks not innovative. The squid grilled is actually breaded and over cooked. Place is full, but maybe Singapore has better to share at this price point. There are some good dishes: beef, scallops, etc. Just can find similarly tasty with bigger portions and better value
5
We have been here a few times. The quality is consistent. And it was more affordable as we got the set lunch menu. There are 2 choices of $28++ for 3 items or $38 for about 5 items. It was really great watching Chef Carlos prepare all the food in front of us. The staff were polite and were able to advice is on the food.
5
i've heard that this restaurant is good and have been wanting to try for a long while.Considering that I just had dinner the night before at The JoÃ«l Robuchon restaurant, 5 stars at Esquina is incredible!The decor was very quaint and welcoming. The food, amazing! Our first server was not fluent in spoken English, but someone else took over soon enough, and the rest of our experience was excellent
3
First thing to note regarding all the glowing reviews - since September there is a new chef in place and he has changed 70% of the menu, so please be mindful of the validity of any review prior to this...Overall, this was a disappointing experience on several counts. Biggest issue was the food - trying to make a full scale menu out of tapas dishes makes no real sense - this would be much better as a simple tapas menu, all single portions and priced accordingly.The beef cheek was two minuscule tortillas ($18), the Spanish omelet is contained in an egg shell (hello 90s!) and other dishes are simply too small for the price paid. Doesn't really work very well. The idea of a proper tapas bar is to mix quantity with good drinks - not to try and cram a sit-down dinner with portions sized for a baby.Quite a few items where not available which the staff tried to compensate by sending a plate of baby squids (actually the better dish of those we had) - nice touch. Yet service was quite patchy. Wine list is OK, with price quite high for the quality of wines but this is par for the course in Singapore.I think this must work better at the bar downstairs rather than in the upstairs dining room - simply not the right concept
5
I have walked by the restaurant many times as I was mostly on Sundays in the area but then it is closed. This time it happened to be around on a Saturday and whilst waiting for friends to go to another place we got a table to take a quick snack...Well, wanting a snack and eating half the menu as it was so great to read, to try and to enjoy.... that's what I call a surprise experience.My wife and I were simply stunned by the great presentation of their food, by the quality of taste and by the for Singapore fair pricing. Honestly, for someone who likes modern Tapas with a twist it is a must!Chef's well done! We surely will come back as my wife just reminded me to write a review about you guys!... There is not really a dish with is better than the other one they are all on the same level......another great thing - the service! In the meantime, it becomes difficult to find great service in Singapore... but for Esquina - you have nailed it!!!!!!We will come again
2
... or whoever it was who greeted us at the door and answered calls for reservations (the same guy). He was rude and quite inappropriate, and did not inform us that there was only outdoor seating when we called ahead to check. Any restaurant in Singapore would reasonably do this. Or at least pretend to be apologetic that their diners only have the option of sweating it out outside.I like the food here, but in a city like ours where great options for food are a plenty and the restaurant scene is always buzzing, there's simply no reason to have to bear inconsiderate service. I'll be bringing friends elsewhere where I won't be embarrassed by the quality of service.

Carlos made my night unique
Tasting food that he explained very well to all the customer
Fresh infredient and the BBC banana amazing
Ill be there again on my next trip.
Bravo!!!!
4
Great food although servings might be a tad small. They gave us dessert tapas on the house which was a nice end to the evening! Overall it was a great girls' night out!
4
First of all, book a table upstairs. Cosy with a lovely ambiance, attentive wait staff and very tasty food made for sharing. The black ink squid was my favourite and the pork belly was really good too. Definitely worth trying.
5
Best Spanish good outside Spain - would recommend to all my friends when they come to Singapore!!!!!
5
New chef Carlos and his team did a great job. Very enjoyable and the service from Myra, Karen and the others very good. Updated wine list seems more reasonably priced. Always reliable. Great music too. :)
5
This gem was close to my hotel but that was not the reason I kept coming back. This is quality food prepared with skill and attention to detail. Sitting at the bar and watching then prep was an entertainment in itself. Ok, portions are small and prices are high but this is Singapore. But those who like quality food will like.Carlos and his team are friendly and chat as they work. And when their Jamon did not meet my expectation, it was not freshly carved, Carlos replaced it with another dish without me having to ask
4
Went there on Saturday last week. The Tapas were great. Order their Cauliflower tapas with cheese and ham (don't remember the name of the dish). That was our favorite. The sardines were great too, as well as the endive salad. Unfortunately the wine list is rather limited. And yes, the food and wine are on the expensive side. Otherwise I will rate this place 5 stars.
3
When reservation was made they really should have informed us that the table was going to be outside next to the road and near the trash. Food is as usual good but the whole ambience is marred, as service outside is also compromised. Given we were celebrating a birthday, it was a bit of a disappointment. Those tables should now have been offered.
4
The portion was extremely small but tasty. We were there from the beginning the restaurant opened but the business went down a lot, I wonder if it has anything to do with the portion and pricing. It is a bit pricy for such a small portion
4
We enjoy our evening at esquina .the staff was courteous , fast and attentive . The food was very good -we had different tapas nicely presented and chose a very good wine from the large selection -we finished he dinner with some delicious desserts- it s a great venueI in Singapore -We will come back on our next trip
3
Not so good after andrew walsh left. And maybe after they expanded too. Food was presented well but flavours could be done better.
5
Had a birthday dinner there with some friends. Food was great and service was fantastic. The suckling pig special on the day was really awesome. Not forgetting we all enjoyed the ibirico ham. Every dish was great! and the wait staff were excellent!
4
Looking for a nice chillout evening with some friends and we agreed to try Esquina out after so many raving remarks. Sangria was great, one of the best I've ever tasted. Paella was flavorful but serving was in a bowl instead of a pan but serving was a tad little. Crispy baby squid was delicious too. Croquet was a bit blant, wouldn't recommend. Beef sliders were fantastic, best choice for the evening. It's definitely a great chillout place with family, friends and colleagues.
5
The intimate setting and shabby-chic decor set the stage for a wonderful dinner for two. We loved sitting up at the bar, watching the chefs prepare our yummy dishes and chatting with them. A glass of cava was exceptionally cold and perfectly dry. The staff was charming, the dishes were all creative and delicious, and our whole experience was enjoyable
4
I'd eaten at 22 Ships in Hong Kong so had high expectations for Esquina. As far the location and the atmosphere went, I was not disappointed. The food and service was also very good. You wouldn't go to Esquina if you are looking for a value meal.
4
One of the best places to go to in town for Spanish tapas, although a little heavy on the wallet. The menu has changed significantly over time and I personally preferred some of their original dishes, but overall still a great meal! I'm happy to add that the staff are generally attentive and eager to assist you with your food and beverage choices
5
Enjoyed a lot! Best tapas bar in Singapore. The food flattering and the vibe is right. You know it when you see everyone eating drinking chatting cheerfully! You easily take more food than you can-coz everything is just so good n you can't stop! And tapas looks very cute when it comes in 2- Makes a perfect date! 
3
Every single dish that we ordered was top quality, Octopus, Scallops, Cod, Croquettas etc. Wine list is small and there are not great choices, they could do with putting a Marques de Caceres or Faustino rioja on the menu or even better perhaps a vina ardanza? I was expecting more Spanish wine options.The service was slow and not enough staff (it was a Friday night) I ordered a double vodka tonic for an aperitif and I could hardly taste the vodka. Upon being seated it took 10 minutes before I was asked if I wanted a drink.The waiters were very nice and friendly and responded to all of our needs, however I think they need more staff and perhaps need to pick up the pace a little. Would got back but only because the food so outstanding
5
This restaurant is so good that I have been 3 times, despite living in London. I once had an 8 hour stopoff in Singapore and headed straight here for lunch, no visit to Singapore is complete without eating here! I would recommend sitting inside at the high table so that you can see your food being made and the precision of the chefs. The food is outstanding - delicious, wonderful flavour combinations, inventive and original. I have recommended this restaurant to everyone I know who ever goes to Singapore
5
We found Esquina through a couple of different travel magazines and were so impressed with the experience, we went twice during our 5 day stay in Singapore recently. It's a very popular, tapas-style spot where you sit at a bar-like seating and watch what's happening in the kitchen. If you are lucky enough to sit near where the head chef plates up, it's full of extra entertainment. Our favourite dishes were a saffron paella with red snapper, pickled beetroot with truffle burrata and smoked candied walnuts and an innovative 'nigiri' done with sweet red pepper - all to die for and many, many choices that were just as fantastic.The service levels were very good. They recognised us returning and are super quick at turning seats over in this popular place.Outside there is is additional seating - you don't get the advantage of seeing the kitchen at work but you still get to enjoy the scrumptious food.Highly recommend as one of Singapore's happening places. p.s. also, the bathroom (very cool); industrial size sink and taps and well designed in line with the theme of the venue
4
We were a table of 5 which was great for trying a good number of dishes on the menu. Great cooking, creative menu.
4
food is consistently good except for the dish of the day - the suckling pig . Tender and juicy but the skin was a little tough vs crispy. Nevertheless , always a delectable experience and can't wait to try their new menu.
4
Innovative food. Very small portions and a cooking staff that will happily talk with you about waht they are doing
5
Title says it all. Excellent food - creative but based on classic flavours. Friendly and efficient service. Jonathan helped us order our food - great recommendations and just the right amount as well.
4
We had a lovely evening at Equina. Ground floor is quite hectic, so we went upstairs. It was quite expensive coming in at $300 for the house red and about 6 dishes to share. Each dish is quite small, so if there is a large group it could get quite punchy as you tend to over-order then. Highlights were the pork crackling and the cauliflower. Service is excellent! We arrived a bit early and they gave us a glass of cava on the house while we waited. My only gripe was the dishes were quite small but very happy to recommend the restauran
5
This restaurant was highly recommended by a passenger on a plane who was actually using his four hour layover to have an encore dining experience. So our expectations were as high as they could be, particularly when we also read the Michelin star history behind the kitchen. Sometimes the expectation can be too high. Here, it proved still too low, believe it or not. From the moment we arrived the service was warm, personal and prompt. Sitting on stools around the kitchen was like a front row at a show. Sad for those who don't get this, whatever. Dishes that marry flavours, beetroot and raspberry. Strawberry and basil. Clever. A modern take on tapas style dishes and quite something to behold. We will be back!
1
Esquina is a seemingly popular tapas bar in the trendy eating area around Jiak Chuan Road,but our visit was a very disappointing one.Both the food and the service left much to be desired.Most annoying was the blatant way the service staff tried to get us to spend more money.Two examples of this:Firstly we ordered a tempranillo Spanish wine for about $90,and the waitress told us we would be much better off ordering another one,priced at $130!Secondly,the waitress recommended the suckling,which we agreed to,but when we checked a few minutes later what the price would be for the four of us,we were told over $200.We cancelled that one.The food we did order was bland and ordinary,with a somewhat strange paella which was a couple of items on a tiny bed of rice.The bill for four came to about $300 for a very unsatisfactory meal
5
Enter this Singapore favourite in the well-heeled area of China town. Surrounded by a myriad of great eateries and bars, Esquina has both inside and outside seating. The ground floor has the counter seats with full view of the action. Sit to the left when entering at the counter and you have the "royal" seats. They also have a few tables and for small parties a second floor. The great thing here is that all dishes can be shared which makes the experience an exploration of the chef's creativity among friend(s). The padron peppers, damon croquettes and nigiri were creative and tasty with the chef ensuring you play the entire palette range when eating. The roasted cauliflower with serrano ham & cheese is an absolute must. We had a fresh sardines dish that was even appreciated by those who did not fancy sardines but changed their mind after the served concoction. The saffron paella with pan-fried fish, chorizo and peas should not be optional, an absolute must! We also indulged in a dish of baked bone marrow, ox cheek, onion jam and a gentleman’s relish, simply amazing. As the apotheose came a warm chocolate fondant served with malt ice cream and chocolate 100’s & 1000’s. This was grade A dark chocolate being used and tasted divine. They have some decent wines by the glass which complement the experience just perfectly. Some great bars are located literally a stone throw away, so a perfect location for an evening out among friends or that special person in your life
3
I heard so much about esquina hence I has always wanted to dine there. After dining there, there were some hit and misses. I had about 5 to 6 dishes and my favourite was the Roasted cauliflower,serrano ham & cheese.The hit items were: Padron peppers, ponzu dressingIberico pork & foie gras burgers,pulled pork, avocado mayonnaiseTruffled ham & cheese toastie, quail’s eggBut then you have to go at least once to try for youself
1
ll portions are minuscule and the tapas are generally not Spanish style, more like a spanish-asian fusion. The service is incredibly slow (despite the place being really small). We paid a ridiculous SGD40 per person for one tapas each and drinking water (10SGD x bottle!). We sat on a very uncomfortable stool around a lowercase round table
4
Very good food and excellent service. Not really tapas as the size of servings are larger than a usual tapas. A bit on the expensive side.
5
Staff recommendation of the food is excellent.
Place was small, but it was cleanliness
steak was eaten at the best
1
After the ridiculous dinner (in terms of quality and quantity )...I went to Seven eleven to eat something...avoid it
3
We went back here recently, about a year after we last ate here... I remember it seeming better... Maybe other places are catching up... Or maybe it was just early in the week...
5
I found Esquina on my last trip to Singapore. I returned twice on that trip and I am going twice again on this trip. This is my favorite restaurant in Singapore.
4
Perfectly formed bar space, genuinely buzzing atmosphere and seating right opposite the busy open kitchen. Padron peppers, croquetas, cod brandade and calamares all hit the mark. The only disappointment was the paella which was very over-salted. Rather than moan about this online(!), I informed the waitress so I hope this was conveyed to the kitchen. We'll be back for sure..
4
Absolutely love how close we were to the cooks and chef. We could see them doing their thing while sitting in the bar. The desserts were to die for. Had the basil, marshmallows dessert. Just OMG.Other than that, the other food was pretty good as well
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants ever! The food here is unbelievable and the wine is perfect too. We went late afternoon and were seated straight away (we sent someone down first to reserve the seats as this ain't always the way I hear!! We had 2 beautiful bottles of red, and more dishes than we needed! We kept ordering and ordering! The chef was incredibly friendly and would check all was well with our group. The concept is perfect and although it's hearty in its pricing, the food, wine and experience was well worth the money. We paid about Â£500 in total although we chose good wine that highly inflated the overall cost. This is a must for anyone who loves good food in Singapore!
5
This is a fairly small restaurant, at least downstairs (there is a dining room upstairs too, but I haven't been in it yet). Downstairs there is bar seating, plus outside tables. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent and creative, based around some classic Spanish tapas dishes, but with some really cool Asian fusion influences. Food quality is top-notch
1
30g of jamon iberico at SGD30 (photo attached) so eat it slowly! And it's also not great quality. All portions are minuscule and the tapas are generally not Spania style, more like a spanish-asian fusion. The service is incredibly slow (despite the place being really small). We paid a ridiculous SGD160 per person including a couple of glasses of wine. In summary: avoid at all costs
4
Had a lovely birthday celebration with my husband. The staff brought a apple pie with lighted candle for my hubby. Food was delicious and service was prompt.
5
My first time to Equina and it did not disappoint. Delectable food with a good view at the bar counter
1
Where do I begin? The seating here is really uncomfortable, with cold, hard metal bar stools facing an open kitchen that made it rather warm for diners. The food and drinks were expensive and completely unremarkable. Their sea urchin crab bisque was shockingly salty and a complete disgrace. For good Spanish food in Singapore, go to Catalunya or Serenity instead
4
When we are talking tapas we do not refer to olives, anchovy... They serve small sampling portions of extremely tasty food ranging from foie burgers to a preparation with urchin and Hokaido scallops. The wine list is varied though somewhat in the expensive side. The service is correct but nothing more neither. Certainly a place I will return t
4
Very good food - service was a bit hit and miss. We had the sourdough and brandade, which was good, but the serve of brandade was pretty stingy for the amount of bread. The croquettes were ok. Suckling pig was awesome and wagyu was very nice. Cotes du Rhone expensive for what it was (Singapore prices).The service crapped out at dessert time. Watching a chef handle fish and our dessert at the same time was not a great visual. Handled on complaining - with the dessert not on the bill - but still not a great end to the meal
2
We've dined at Esquina before and to be fair the experience then was ok ( definitely not the best tapas experience in Singapore but nothing to really complain about). This time around however, the service was absolutely appalling and the food was average too. The waitress and the other staff seemed clueless about most things and the service was so slow that after an hour of waiting patiently for starters (including dishes such as pickled olives which shouldn't take long!) we decided to settle our bill for the few dishes that did reach us and LEAVE. The waitress tried to explain that they were really busy and didn't seem very apologetic about the service at all. We won't be returning!
1
What a disappointment. To start off I ordered the ibérico Bello ta, and asked for bread with tomato, or just bread. It was turned down, bread could not be served with what the waitress described as crispy pork. Jason ibérico crispy??? I raised my eyebrow, to what could only be described as a show of horror to Spanish simple tapa cuisine that followed.Croquetas de Jamon, with no ham inside and a very strong flour taste. Octopus with potatoes harder than apprentice chef boiled potatoes. Tasteless scallops and that was about all I could take. It's great that many of the patrons have never been or have been away for so long from good produce, that they actually find the servings in this place acceptable of a 100 dollar average check.Spain has been done a huge desfavor with this restaurant
5
We had a fantastic meal here and beautiful wine. We selected a variety of dishes - the sea urchin was wonderful.This place rocks. We sat outside under the verandah watching Singapore. This is one place to make sure you eat here.Well worth the effort - book if you can as this place rocks
5
Phenomenal dishes that shows quality and ingenuity in all its dishes.Sit by the bar so you can watch the action.Small plates that allows you to try a few dishes.Have gone back several times....one of my favourite restaurants ever
5
It's our first time to try this restaurant and we were so amazed on how they prepare our food! The server named marjade was the one who served us! Very polite and he really have food knowledge, he's explaining everything course by course and that's a plus point! Compliment to the chefs as well!
2
We organised a family meal in mid April for 13 people, after contacting the restaurant on three occasions to ensure that the table was confirmed including the restaurant contacting us, we arrived to find that a table had not been set! We were there to celebrate our daughters birthday so we tried to make the best of a bad start. Now I know that Singapore is expensive but $14 for a small beer (there was no draft beer available) and the portion sizes we had were tiny and the prices over the top, personally I would say it was pushing the limit. The reason that we had chosen Spanish was to satisfy my daughters request as we have a couple of outstanding Spanish restaurants in Newcastle, Australia! After a small number of Tapas we decided to do the smart thing and find some local food which was far better value. Lesson learnt stick to the local cuisine when travelling and rarely be disappointed
4
The food here is excellent. Small portions of great food with fantastic presentation and excellent service. Sitting at the "bar" in front of where the food is prepared is also great (and ensures you get some air conditioning!) but it's not cheap. Worth it to go once but not a place you go every week.......
5
Esquina will never disapoint me. Last night was again one of this outstanding evening. The tapas are moder, full of flavours, nicely presented. Myra, the manager and sommelier is a great person and you need to meet her. She knows her wines and is full of life.She wiill recommend you nicely. She did with the pork cheeks. It was so succulent. The chefs work in an open kitchen and very interesting to watch the,, like in a laboratory.Nice crowd too. always pleasan
5
Such a lovely surprise! The food is absolutely amazing, and service is brilliant! Special thank you to the Chef, his adorable team and her kind manager. We had a great time and we will come back! I would recommend the beef/foie gras burger, which was delicious!
5
http://missneverfull.com/singapore-esquina-by-jason-atherton/ every single dish we tried was impressive, especially the Spanish Breakfast, Uni bisque and Tiramisu! The other dishes were also great. Everything was freshly made in front of us at the bar, very relax ambiance. Must try
2
The food here was okay but the price was expensive. Bill reached S$300+ for 2 people and I think there are better places in Singapore to spend your money
5
I have actually eaten here a few times now and I have become a massive fan. Esqina isn't really a tapas restaurant but more tapas like... The food is clever and inventive things like the spanish breakfast for example are served in a hollowed out egg.. But its the surprise dishes like the cauliflower cheese that blows me away. Wine selection is pretty good though not brilliant. Service has always been excellent. Went for lunch and their lunch special is actually pretty good value
5
Tapas is a versatile beast, and the way they do it at Singapore's Esquina is in a league of its own. The inventiveness and care presented by the chefs of this fabulous place goes far beyond the world of traditional tapas, elevating the flavours of the excellent produce, enhancing the taste in everything from a not so simple carrot salad to the best ever prepared pork cheeks that was a dish of the day upon out attendance. This is social dining at its best with seats along the bar where you watch the chefs at work, seeing them plate the dishes right in front of you. Absolutely stunning and although not cheap, it's still really good value for your money
3
The overall experience - food, service, value for money - was average compared to other Tapas style restaurants in Singapore. Best dish - Iberico pork/foie gras burger was fantastic. Worst dish - the Vietnamese oysters were totally lackluster. The overall mix and balance of flavors was enjoyable, but the service could improve as didn't seem completely aware of the dishes being served and were not so attentive
4
Stumbled across this little corner establishment. Even though we only wanted a drink we were found a table, and decided to try desert. The service was good, staff really pleasant and whilst we only had desert, it was interesting and tasty. Next time we're in Singapore we will be heading back for 3 courses, hopefully getting 2 seats at the 'bar'. Being able to see the action in the kitchen, reassures you, as you can see how clean the kitchen is
5
Easily the best tapas in Singapore if not in south east asia. The spanish flavors are both daring and contemporary and too are the presentation of dishes. Overall a fun place to hang out with friends or with colleagues. Two thumbs up
4
Tried to book but were told we could not. Rocked up as ordered and had to wait 45 minutes for a table. The food was fun, interesting and we'll cooked. The service was fast and pleasant. Everything just as I would expect of a well run restaurant. nothing very special but a pleasant way to spend and hour or so
5
A birthday dinner for our daughter was highlighted by a visit to this fabulous restaurant. One sits at a bench that overlooks the kitchen. Chef Andrew is like the captain of a ship. Every dish is inspected to ensure a perfect presentatio
5
Visited with my wife for our anniversary and was very impressed with the quality of food, ambiance and service. We sat at the bar which I would highly recommend if you like to watch passionate chefs and staff at work. We shared the thyme bread with marrow butter, crumbed squid with aioli, Spanish Breakfast, savoury churros with olive tapenade and the cauliflower with ham. All dishes prepared right in front of us and made with love. Each meal was tastier than the last and presented beautifully. The waitress brought over a raspberry sorbet as a palate cleanser before our deconstructed tiramisu arrived. The restaurant even prepared a cake wishing us a happy anniversary. I can highly recommend Esquina for a special dinner or a casual catchup with friends. Great sangria and wine list just tops everything off
3
So I have heard the name Esquina talked about in the recent months but just never had a chance to go until this week. My overall dinner experience was simply ok. The seating was quite uncomfortable I must say. The tables are too low for the stools they have. Menu looked really interesting..but what we had was very average food. We had the thyme and onion bread with the marrow butter...very ordinary and oily. The fried churros had no taste to them and the olive burrata did nothing for me. I did however enjoy the baby squid in chilli coriander and black ink aioli and my friend did enjoy her salad of green asparagus and kale. Was extremely disspointed with the desserts...I was really looking forward to the coconut panna cotta (I love coconut) but to my disappointment there was about 4 tiny pieces of panna cotta and the coconut was sooooo subtle..the whole dish looked pretty but wasnt pretty to taste. And their Esquina Tiramisu was average as well. Personally even if the food was average I would go back again if the whole atmosphere was nice..but the service was a little bit of a hit and a miss with one person being quite abrupt..the seating uncomfortable..food was average and the price not so average with 55 per person with no alcohol
2
Food is interesting but the service was pretty bad. Waitress came back 3 times to ask us whether we were finished - trying to have us leave the table - when we were actually waiting for some more dishes. Quite rude, quite inappropriate... And just when we finished finally our desert, they asked us to leave by saying that there had a reservation for this table when this restaurant officially doesn t take reservation. Plus it is very expensive... Not pleasant...
2
Second visit and I must say I won't be rushing back in a hurry. Don't get me wrong, the food here is not bad but it's also nothing special. I did not find any of the dishes to be anything special and the beetroot cured salmon I would not order again personally. The cured wagu was tasty but small in portion. Prices are overall not cheap and the wine list is non-existent. Also, they don't take booking so it's just walk in.
5
Unique food...absolutely loved it. Best tapas in SG compared to Food Bar Dada and others tried so far ...visit with max 2 ppl otherwise queues are too long. we tasted almost the whole menu. tad on the pricy side but totally worth i
4
Esquina in Spanish means 'a corner' which is good way to describe this magical piece of Iberica nestled into a niche of Chinatown. We sat at the bar which has an old world feel, and where you can watch the chefs at work preparing your dishes stage by stage; its fascinating. Upstairs there is a more elaborate restaurant and there are also tables outside. The service is friendly and efficient. There are spanish beers and elegant wines from all over. The 'tapas' are generusly portioned so that you can build a meal to remember. We had fried baby octopus, a sweated little gem lettuce, kale and green gaspacho plate, with roasted hazelnuts, which was just sensational, and beetroot cured salmon as starters. Then grilled seabass with broccoli coucous, orange and samphire grass that oosed flavour, and duckbreast with heirloom carrots and a rich red jus that was perfectly cooked. And the place is utterly and intriguingly different from more traditional Singapore style

I really enjoyed the tapas we ordered. Every dish that was served just hits your taste buds. The starters and main course was excellent. It's really interesting watching the chefs preparing the dishes while enjoying your food by the bar counter. I did enjoyed the whole food experience in Esquina. I would definitely take my friends here if they're in town

On the final night of our honeymoon my wife and I decided to book into this little tapas restaurant just before our flight back home. Both being fans of Jason Atherton's other restaurants we had high hopes. But not this high.When booking online i made a very off the cuff remark about it being our honeymoon. On our arrival we were given a couple of glasses of fizz - nice touch, thought that would be it.The food extravaganza that followed was mind-blowing, every dish a work of art for the taste bids and the eyes.I want to thank all involved for making it a truly great night.I'm writing this in the lounge at the airport two hours later so it's fresh in my min

We review mostly bars so when we fall in love with a restaurant we want to declare our love yelling from the rooftop... This time we are screaming out loud: Esquina is AMAZING!!!The setting: Party of 7 (lucky number), Friday night sitting outside after a long day at the Buy Me A Drink App office.The meal: We ordered everything on the menu. Every dish was a little gem on it's own and together they made a wonderful meal. So good that the squid got ordered twice! The drinks: The boys were a bit boring with beers but we explored the possibilities and settled for a wonderful sangria with yummy foam on top... so good we lost count of how many we had.The price tag: Singapore standards, about $150 pp ... but we did go a bit crazy on the menu :)Is not the first time we enjoy Chef Andy's talents and it is definitely not going to be the last, we are yet to be disappointed by this corner of culinary joy in Singapore

Food. Service. Ambiance. Get there early so at to not wait for a table. Daily specials and changing menu keeps us coming back again and again.

The restaurant is in a nice part of te town with old houses, close to China town.The Iberian based menu is very interested and the chef makes a great job preparing the dishes in front of the clients.I asked some delicious baby squids and a nice sea bass and drinker a good french sauvignon blank.I went for the executive lunch that was not too pricey
5
It's good and sadly too seldom to see such passion at the kitchen,!Very creAtive and extremely well executed dishesA personal extra star for the sea level thins with bisques (it's much more elaborated Than that but I let you discover it).I loved it and can't wait to go back

Best tapas so far in Singapore in a city where other "tapas" are just excuses for small plates. This was innovative, quality ingredients, wonderfully prepared. Friendly staff and a fun bar to sit at and watch the action. Will definitely go back

I went here for dinner earlier in week on high recommendation from a local and was really impressed. Each dish was incredible. Fantastic flavours, balance, mix. Some of the very best food I've ever been lucky enough to eat, anywhere in world. The thing is, the food isn't what made it for me. The design of the place is brilliant. Sitting at bar and watching the teamwork and care in the meals so close is incredible. The music, the ambiance, the overall layout & decor, and the chatting with chefs and Marion d' - that was cool.But that wasn't it either. What made it exceptional was the service. Andrew (executive chef), Ricky (chef) and Marion (maitre d') were exceptionally polite, relaxed, welcoming, warm, humble, helpful and generous with their time. The kind of service you'd love to have in a tapas bar/restaurant in particular but which I've never seen - at least not at this level.ANYWAY, I had another night in Singapore and found myself in the same area. I didn't want to go back because I didn't want to jinx memory of my great dinner there the night before. But I went anyway and it was at least as good 2nd time round. On all levels but especially service. As Marion said you rarely hear people say "oh the service was awful but the food made up for it". Poor service poisons a meal. Or, in this case (twice!) it lifts what was an incredible dinner to an incredible dining experience. The service from Andrew first night, Ricky (both nights) and especially Marion was the best I've ever seen anywhere. Many thanks!!!!!!Nic

My husband and I dined here a couple of weeks ago and had a great meal. I loved the bar dining and the Head Chef, Andy, introduced himself straight away and was very friendly throughout the meal. It was great to be able to ask the chef directly his recommendations and how he cooked things. The food was great - very different but well executed and presented. The breakfast eggs were really fab and the beetroot dish was amazing - we were recommended this by the two diners sitting next to us at the bar - my husband is not a beetroot fan but loved this! We tried a number of dishes and all of which were very good. The staff were also very knowledgeable and helpful (something that lacks in so many other restaurants in Singapore). The wine list was good and although I did not know the wines the staff were very helpful and knew what they were like. Overall I would recommend the restaurant as it is a fun place, relaxed with excellent food and being able to converse with the chef was also a bonus. I will definitely be returning in the future - a hidden gem
3
It's a nice small place with indoor and outdoor seating area. The service is polite and prompt without being exceptional in terms of recommendations. The food is good ( but not superb). With a price tag of sgd 100+ per person ( including a glass of wine each) I do expect more.
5
We were here for our second night dinner, we try to make a booking but they only accept it when you are there 630pm shape, if you are late the table will be given away to others, so you gotta be on time to dine in this restaurant, there are two floor for this restaurant, sitting area is upstairs, a long bar and outdoor dinning area is downstairs,we opt to seat inside due to the hot weather, luckily we did, we got our seats at the long bar, we choose nearly everything on the menu and we split it amongst ourselves, simple food been turn into great tasty food for your enjoyment, we had a bottle of white and red, wine selection is comparable to the food as well, service was good, the place is pack throughout the evening, by the time we left the restaurant around 10pm, people still coming in for dinner and drinks. 4 person dine in with 2 bottles of wines and food total the bill up to SGD700+, it is kind of pricey for me personally... Well, again this is Singapore, gotta pay if you demand for this type of quality service and food, you won't regret it
5
So nice experience,The food was very good and the location so particular and amazing. Hardly recommended
4
amazing rib, fresh oyster.! I will certainly go back to the place for it. however wine seems overpriced.... go for beer.

My girlfriend received an email from Esquina advertising their "Business Set Lunch" so we decided to try lunch having been there for dinner before. We tried our luck as I emailed them to see if they could make a booking before they opened that day and to their credit, they replied very promptly. The date was 25th September, 2014.Like some restaurants, Esquina offered 3 stages for the meal: To Start (appetiser), To Follow (Mains) and To Finish (Dessert), from memory, you could go for any 2 of the combinations if you didn't want all 3.We like the fact that the food is fresh and prepared right in front of you if you are seated at the bar. If it's a cool day/night, outdoor seating is available though indoor seating is our preference. Service is always good and we were not disappointed after our latest visit.Our courses were as follows:To start:1) Beetroot & Buratta2) Salad of baby gem (didn't take a photo)If you like your cheese, try their Burrata (made from mozzarella and cream), it goes very nicely with the beetroot and a refreshing from the first bite. Salads are easier to get so we wanted to mix things up with the first starter.To follow:3) Seabass Paella4) Pork bellyBoth were cooked very nicely and the rice in the paella was not burnt/crispy, which suited us. The rich pepper flavour in the paella really came through and complemented the seabass well.The pork belly and cheek were beautifully cooked and one was wrapped in lardo (cured pork fat), this went very well with the leek, squid, sweet corn and bacon.To finish:5) Popcorn milk - as the name suggests, it really did have a popcorn taste! Was a nice way to end the lunch and the burnt orange topped dessert off very nicely indeed.In our humble opinion, it's definitely cheaper to go for this set lunch as opposed to ordering these a la carte and we were lucky that lunchtimes are not as crowded as dinnertimes. Apparently there is an upstairs section, but we were not sure it was open during our lunch

Confess I am a fan but today was not the greatest experience overall although as always the food was excellent. Salt-baked beetroot, whipped burrata, truffle honey etc was good as was the crispy baby squid with chilli coriander. Mains were sea bass and snapper,again consistently good but when oh when will they change this menu or do they assume we will only come here once?However running out of wines and especially the staples like Sauvignon Blanc is unforgivable and the Pollen St Social Red was undrinkable having gone 'off'.Used to be that attention to detail was key here but not today and whatever you do don't ask for coffee as the staff seemed as unfamiliar with the coffee machine as defusing a nuclear bomb,taking 15 minutes to eventually provide a cappuccino.Maybe like all of us from time to time they were just having an off day,it happens!

Don't go here if you are expecting the traditional Spanish Tapas found in bars in Spain. The Esquina tapas version is the type of upmarket tapas that we have seen a lot of in Australia and in London, i.e. fine dining tapas. Esquina was really high quality (and prices). The two of us shared four tapas plates and a dessert and that was more than enough food. We had the salt baked beetroot, whipped burrata, truffle honey, raspberry & pinenut crumb ($16); roasted cauliflower, serrano ham & cheese ($18); sea bass, red pepper ketchup, chorizo red pepper paella, black olive ($32) and roasted pork belly, braised pork cheek, charred squid, sweet corn and bacon ($33). The dessert I chose was popcorn milk, chocolate mousse, hazelnut & burnt orange ($15). It was so hard to rate which tapas plate was the best, they were all incredibly amazing combinations of flavours. The chef has worked with Jason Atherton in London and it shows in the quality. It is a tiny place with only about 20 or so high bar stools seated around the bar, so you can watch your tapas being prepared. Our tapas plates came in sequence one after the other, which was perfect. They have a room upstairs for a more expensive super club (kind of like a degustation). We booked in advance via Chope to get a seat at the bar for 6pm. The total cost was SIN$180 including drinks and service. The area is a great area of Singapore with lots of cafes, although our taxi driver got lost getting us there so do your research and have your google map handy before you go because none of the local taxi drivers knew where it was based on the address alone (they had to type the address into their GPS system). This is really worth seeking out for the experience if you appreciate fine dining. The taxi fare from the Mandarin Oriental was only $7 each way

Went to Esquina 2.0 for my anniversary with my girlfriend. The staffs were attentive and nice, and the food was good. They like to shower guests with additional small dishes complimentary from the chef. It was really a nice experience. And the smoke bone marrow butter for the starter and the brown butter for the beef was just so aromatic. The scent fills your mouth when you take a bit into it and makes you pause momentarily to enjoy the taste. Although the rest are all as good, this is my take home memory from them. Just a bit pricy for a middle class working adult. (that's just the supperclub menu i think) But worth it. Just can't afford to go all the time. =
3
Dined here the 2nd time, still don't find this place attractive at all for the kind of price we paid...(S$250each) No chemistry between the staff nor connection with the customer even we sat at the counter. Food is so so, no surprise and it's really expensive.... I would rather go to BAM...
1
So fed up with Singapore overpriced, poor restaurant experiences. I don't understand this place it's supposed to be a tapas bar but they don't serve authentic tapas "Tapas = small Spanish savory dishes, typically served with drinks at a bar". Charging $22-$39 for a dish is not tapas that is main course pricing. There were just a few selections of tapas or starter type dishes with so called tapas that are in between a starter and a main course size, but way too small to be considered main course, yet charging expensive main course prices. We even checked with the waiter before ordering if they were main courses and he said yes - so we expected to get them at the same time. No - I got mine first and we were still waiting 10 minutes later after I had finished mine for my husbands to arrive. Don't waste your time...unless you enjoy being ripped off and crap service
4
Nothing less than perfection for all the dishes we ordered. Iberico BBQ pork & foie gras burger is definitely a must try!Great services provided by all the staff. Even though it's expensive but I would still strongly encourage people to at least try it once
4
We saw this place in Gourmet Traveller so made a note to try it this trip to Singapore. We had the business lunch which was good value at $45 for 3 courses. The sangria with amazing foam was a great way to start off a lovely lunch. The broccoli "couscous" under the snapper is something I will try and recreate myself! The area where the restaurant is located is gorgeous with lots of little bars and places to eat mixed in with more traditional eating houses
4
We went for the supper club menu, and there are certainly some stand out items. The scallops starter and spanish breakfast were excellent, and the pork belly is a must-try. The meat was tender, and the broth that accompanied it perfectly complimented the rest of the dish. Our fav was the basil sorbet for dessert. Skip the sangria. It was a tad too hot upstairs for a comfortable meal, so will return only for tapas downstairs
5
Great selection of small plates served at counter with view of well-run kitchen. Counter seats well worth the wait. Helpful staff and good banter with chef
4
Tapas is one of my faves. I do prefer simple, quality flavours which haven't been over-complicated (I think some of the dishes are verging into the over complicated category, in my opinion). That said, the food was yum. Portions were VERY small for the price paid. Ordered the panacotta and it came out with approx two pesky 1cm cubed pieces of panacotta and a couple of bits of peach - very tasty but needs to be double this size at least. Come on Esquina, at those prices surely you can afford to put a little bit more samphire on the top of the snapper?! Could also do with more options for wines by the glass
4
I think the landlord maybe to blame but the prices are outrageous. 8 Bucks for Pane Con Tomato....That said all of the food is very, very good. Just get a credit line before you go
4
You're in the thick of the action here, sitting up at a long counter overlooking the kitchen. Esquina calls itself a tapas bar and there are a few dishes that qualify, such as jamon croquettes and marinated olives, but this is very classy bistro fare, prepared in front of you. It does offer reservations and I'd recommend you book in advance, otherwise you might be in for a wait. Go to dishes include the Spanish breakfast, the raw beef and the pork and foie gras sliders. There seemed to be a fair few vegetarian options as well
5
I have dined at Esquina on multiple occasions for lunch but it was my first time for dinner last week. Andy and his team were on perfect form behind the counter delivering flawless dishes. My wife is vegetarian and I asked Andy to order for us and he served the perfect mix of heirloom tomatoes, beetroot salad with burrata pinenuts and raspberry, baby gem asparagus and green gazpacho, veg version of the spanish breakfast (extra chorizo on mine!!), lamb for me and a weird sounding but beautiful popcorn milk and choc mousse. I would be there more often if it was more affordable :-)>Kudos to Andy and his team for consistently delivering fab food and a fab experience. Keen to try the supper club next time
5
Its a great experience going to Esquina. Loved sitting at the counter and watching professionals at work preparing your meal. Everything is prepared from scratch right there in front of you. its a little expensive but I suppose the fact that there is a queue of people waiting at the door to get it also says something
5
Luckily we were seated at the bar seats right in front of the kitchen as watching the chef's at work was like watching Picaso paint a masterpiece! How that many people can work so efficiently in such a small place as they do is beyond me. A great variety of excellent dishes with different tastes ... The sea urchin & crab bisque is a must, as is the beet root salad. We had seven dishes in all, each one a masterpiece of taste and texture.Wine list interesting with a good selection by the glass ... Expensive but all wine is in Singapore.Can not recommend highly enough
4
Excellent food and great to see the chefs in action in their tiny workspace. The jamon croquetas were great. Three of us shared a wide variety of plates and all were tasty and interesting. Prices are a little high but this place is different and serves excellent food, even though it was a little hard to find. Having found it for a light lunch, we had no hesitation heading back for dinner
4
Our dinner at this restaurant was due to a recommendation, for nice food and quite setting. The restaurant has two levels, the upper level being more comfortable dine-in, where our table was selected. The choice of dishes is interesting and not quite the standard fare, with mix of ingredients for each dish.......super. The food is very tasty, delicately prepared, and each of us were left with the same opinion. The staff were able to make good recommendations and this was helpful. The charges are quite on the heavy side, but not far away from the flight of prices Singapore has lately seen.
4
Excellent and creative cuisine. Not flawless execution in my view , but nonetheless frankly excellent by Singaporian standards. Excellent and kind service l. The prices were frankly astronomical , good for the owners, happy for them ! I will definitely go back but will try to get someone to pick up the tab 
5
What can I say but you cannot miss eating here,firstly outstanding service, staff were excellent. The food outstanding we have dined at many tapas places around the world and the has been the best.Recommend the beetroot dish, paella dish, squid dish, it was all wonderful.Then we were escorted down the road to the study with a secret password, once again excellent service, can't remember bar tender name but he was the best
5
Great restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious and good value and a interesting selection of food. I loved the decor and the service was very good and very friendly. It is a small restaurant that only takes bookings for 6.30 the rest of the time is just walk in. The wine list was short but very good and reasonable. I am looking forward to returning. After finishing dinner the restaurant gives you a code so you can get into the Library, a great little bar, at the back of the tailor shop. Great night out

Another restaurant from the same group "The Study (that is only 50 meters away) I loved it and was very excited to try Esquina.The Study is very busy but the staff charming & knowledgeable and the food excellent. What a contrast and a disappointment with Esquina... My friends and I showed up 8:30, without reservations, and tried out luck.The greeter/hostess/waitress told us there was no table and that they will be full for the whole night ... she was very "dry" in her choice of words and her gesture & body language showed that we should not even dare waiting....We stayed in the area, came back at 10:30 and were happy to see an outdoor table leaving.A charming server greeted us and told us that we may only be able to have cold dishes, he went back inside to check for the hot food.The same female staff who turned us away earlier on came out and told us she could not give us this table (the empty one outside) because they were not accepting anyone and that they were "committed" for the rest of the night which is a polite way of saying "we dont want/need you here now!"Its so sad that Esquina does not follow the service standard (& courtesy) of their sister restaurant ..
5
Decided to walk uphill from Outram Park MRT towards Duxton hill and explore some new place. Many places were closed on Monday, found Esquina. This explore was worth of. Will definitely come back.Got place on desk. So much fun to follow the chefs working and raising the servings, executive chef Andrew guiding and keeping the quality standard.Foodâ€¦ absolutely great. Tasted: Iberico bellota, beetroot, scallops, paella and beef tartar. Waiting to explore more next time. My favorites so far: beetroot and beef tartar
5
Its been a while since our last visit here and we will certainly not wait too long for our next visit. Always love the very quaint decor and the dynamic action that we get to see when we sit at the counter watching the chef and his team preparing the food and get to taste it. As in our previous visit, we ordered the bone marrow which is our favorite and as always was delicious. . As the portions were not too big, it gives you reasons to order more and our strategy here is always to order one or two of our regular favorites and then watch what our neighbors order and if it looks good, we have the same. So we had a few different dishes like the scallops after seeing them on the seats next to us as the dishes look simply amazing and they were very tasty. We also like the The relax , cosy vibe of the restaurant as usually the neighbors next to us are always happy to share their recommendations of the dishes they had. Being a small restaurant, the service was personal and attentive. Lovely charming restaurant for good quality, delicious and original tapas in Chinatown 
5
It is called the Tapas Bar. What was served and how it was presented is something you see in Hollywood movies.The Chef did a set menu for us:Thyme and onion bread with marrow butter!Beetroot with burrata, honey & truffle oil!!Seared scallops and duck green curry with coconut rice and peanut crumble and coconut foam!!!Baked cod with salt cod milk, sirloin steak with burnt onions, mushroom ketchup, toasted sour dough crumbs.The icing: chocolate mousse with chocolate soil, blackberry gel and vanilla churros!!!!!!The Irish chef came round a couple of times!!! His work of art surpsasses any Michelin*
5
As always food, service and ambience great. Lovely chatting with Andrew, always a pleasure as such a down to earth normal person. Thanks guys
5
A really excellent menu with so many combinations of tastes you may not have tried before. My colleague with me was dining for the third time in a week and she was still finding new things on the menu to try. This is definitely not one of those tired tapas bars in Singapore. Sitting at the service bar it was great to watch all the activity in the kitchen. Really good service with a real mix of peopl
4
I liked the atmosphere of Esquina. Open kitchen's have long past the point of being radical but this is likely the closest I have sat to the action. The head chef (I think Andrew) was Irish and had a stake in the business. He was clearly talented and the meals were very creative. Maybe lacking in quantity a bit but the variety of dishes made it hard on deciding what to eat.The service was fine, though it's not really the place in my view that one should expect constant attention. This place is about a lively and energetic atmosphere
2
We will 3 and seating in a small little corner space,oder about 6 tapas ,3 drink.
Bill was almost $300. Not worth just for tapas.
Went somewhere else for dinner as we left the place still hungry.
Will not return for sure.
1
Walked into esquina a couple of days ago, and after a year of being an avid regular , esquina standard of service have dropped tremendously. Maybe it is the lack of trainning of their new staff , esquina no longer is what it used to be.Usually, my drinks and first tapas will be taken care of when I stepped it as the hostess remembers me and greets me with my name.And sits me down and always recommending the head chef new specials and always making us feel so at home.Yes the food have gone to better standard , you can see how much dedication there is in each and every dish. Shame service is not what I used to see. Pity that the place lost such great staff .Will be back only for the food.

Had a delicious meal at Esquina last night. A Spain meets Asian fusion bar/bistrot. seating at the bar inside; bistrot tables outside. Not only is the food creative, interesting and tasty but the staff is equally delightful and engaged! Each server's unique personality is also in evidence which quite frankly makes the experience even better. The servers are knowledgeable and genuinely interested in what they are serving and seem to really care about the service they provide. They exude a confidence minus the arrogance one often finds. We had everything from the crackling with smoked roe and salt cod to hamachi with smoked duck and shave walnuts to the beetroot salad with truffly burrata. The fois gras was sublime. The only thing I would seriously change is the sangria which is cloyingly sweet. I needed to add limes to tone it down a bit. This was the consensus at the table. Maybe if the chef is so wedded to serving a Kool-Aid type drink, he/she could make a tart batch and a sweet batch. The flavors of the sangria were good, just way too sweet
5
This is a lovely place that takes you away from the usual food courts or overpriced restaurants in Singapore. It has CHARACTER, which is a rarity in this modernized urbanville... and the small plates here are creative and tasty. Everything from the heirloom tomato salad to the divine iberico pork burges are yummy! My only criticism is that there is a touch too much sweetness in the recipes. But this is easily washed down with some great white Rioja (a rarity in the Spanish wine world!).My only other criticism is the lack of comfort in the bar stools which are hard on your crotch! Other than that, this place is a breath of fresh air to Singapore and it's wine/tapas scene.Lovely..
5
We found this place quite by accident.After a busy morning walking round Chinatown we were hungry and looking for somewhere to eat.Then taking a random right turn we found Esquina and decided to go in.We were a little dubious at first not being quite sure what we had walked into, but a warm welcome made us feel a little more at ease.However after the first taste we were blown away. The food we ordered was simply exquisite.I'm no culinary expert, but i know what I like, and the food here was nothing short of exceptional.The desert was to die for !Infact we were so impressed we made a special trip there on our last day in Singapore.I cannot recommend this place enough. Just brilliant 
5
We visited Esquina on our last night in Singapore and were not disappointed. We sat at the bar which gave us the ability to watch the Chefs in action which was a real pleasure as both my hubby and I are real foodies and thoroughly enjoyed the busy atmosphere. The head chef was more than happy to talk to us whilst he was plating up and he served us some of the best food we had eaten on our trip. Although quite pricey for tapas, we still felt it was worth it and left feeling completing satisfied with our evening. Would definitely go back if we visit Singapore again
4
I had heard everyone rave about this place, so I went for dinner one night. It was really busy so the staff weren't as attentive as they would normally be. The food was nothing special- really yummy but pretty standard (by Australian standards!). It was also really pricey. (and only 'tapas' sizing, so if you are a big eater you would have to order quite a bit!
5
Esquina is without a doubt up there as one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Great atmosphere, attentive service and unique, memorable food. I highly recommend the eight course tasting menu with wine pairings. Charmaine looked after us really well - excellent attention to detail - and even arranged a nice surprise for my husbands birthday. Can't wait to go back
4
This is a small restaurant and it might get crowded on week-ends with few seating, but on a week day we could secure a nice table outside this lovely shop house renovated as a trendy restaurant. Despite the name and some sort of tapas proposed, the food is quite eclectic, definitely western with just one or two Asian dish. We all chose different dish and all loved the food. simply delicious. The portion are a bit on the small size but you forgive them given the good quality-price value.The staff was very nice and helpful, particularly to attend my allergy.definitely recommended by a nice casual evening with friends
5
Amazing experience , great atmosphere .... (by the way excellent music) , awesome food , reasonable price , very friendly service , ...you will spend a great evening observing talented cooks and smiling chef preparing , some classics with a twist ,and some surprising creations .Absolutely delicious !!!! I can recommend every item listed or not !!
5
Thank you Andrew and staff for another lovely night of fab food and great service! The mackerel was the highlight of the night for me, it was delicious.
4
Had a fabulous meal at this buzzy Tapas bar..,,. It is fairly small and there are no reservations however the staff are great at moving things along to get a table, The food is innovative and exciting ..we could have chosen all of them. It is fun sitting at the counter and seeing the chefs creating the dishes and a real treat to be served by the head chef who explains his dish.The Tapas seem Spanish with an Asian influence plus a twist !! Every one we selected was delicious
5
Esquina, by far has been the best restaurant to be in for the last 2 years.Fridays are the nights to be there, although they don't take reservations, the lovely shamini takes care of you from the get go. Make sure you get her to put your names down on her wait list. She have made our Friday nights been the most lovable time ever. She together with the amazing Team makes sure every guest gets taken care of in elite style. The. Best dishes in Esquina definitely got ti be the sea urchin, beetroot salad,beef tatatre and the ox cheek and tounge. Chef andrew Walsh is definitely, the next big chef that will hit thw world. He ia amazing and talented.Definately a place be. Esquina rock on!
5
A great place, packed and busy (on both sides of the long bar) but adding to the great atmosphere - food is exceptionally good and expect the unexpected in many of the small dishes. Service is good but I feel it dropped a notch over the past could of visits in the last two months or so. Pricy though but the famous price/value relation works out, i.e. you get exceptional value for the slightly higher price tag
5
No bookings was well catered to by allowing us to change tables twice to finally land a seat at the bar overlooking the extremely well orchestrated kitchen with the maestro in charge, but not in an aggressive way as is displayed in many well orchestrated kitchens. Friendly staff and engagement from the kitchen made for a great experience. Good pricing of food and wine, and a casual relaxed atmosphere combined with great food made us want to come back again and again but we were afraid this might constitute stalking! Must have is the sangria cocktail
5
I visited this venue October 2012 so apologies for the lateness of the review! my experience was amazing Andrew and his team here run a great show! and it was full to capacity, and the service was a joy to watch, the customers have a chance here to liase with the head chef (Andrew) who is more than happy to help even though he is busy organising his bragade! - give it a try you wont be dissapointed
5
Loved this place so much I went twice in three days. The chicken wing dish must be one of the greatest culinary creations of all time. They have a very reasonable corkage fee so don't forget to BYOB. It's small and can get packed, but watching the chefs go at it (and at each other) is part of the fun
3
To the management, is it policy to tell customers (rudely) to leave when they are trying to order another bottle of wine after several dishes? Because there is a waitlist ? Our understanding is Esquina does not have a reservation policy and therefore arrived early for a seat.Utterly disappointing and horrible service experience and we will never be back.
4
My wife and I visited this small but nice restaurant on a Friday evening. As it was not possible to make reservations, we arrived early and had a small table next to the counter (I believe the only table inside). The restaurant filled up quickly. Service was friendly and efficient and we enjoyed some nice tapas while watching the cooks at work behind the counter. Great, cool place
4
After walking past the place a few times, my curiosity got the better of me and i decided to arrange to meet with friends for a drink. The friendly service was great, very attentive, the staff were smiling and genuinely interested. The quality and selection of tapas was excellent, we sat on the outsideundercover verandah space. Grazing our way through many of the dishes. The wine selection available was of a good standard - lots of choice, both for the palette and the pocket.I will definately be returning - These guys know there doing - Well done
4
Visited singapore just as the haze cleared which probably explained why we had no problem getting a table. Trendy bar/restaurant with tasty food. Good wine selection. The kind of place you would like to make a regular haunt, if only we lived in Singapore ....
5
You find yourself in Singapore, major hub of SE Asia, and the last place you expect to find yourself in is a European restaurant, let alone a Spanish tapas bar. However, nestled in the trendy upcoming Chinatown (formerly the red light district), away from the glizt of the marina it is an absolute gem of a restaraunt. Think Barafina, Soho, London only better. This wonderful restaurant elegantly combines modern Spanish tapas with a hint of Asian spice with a great wine list to boot. I have visited many European restaurants where Asian flavours have been shoehorned into traditional dishes with disappointing results.Esquina, with a wonderful young and talented chef John Cardwell, has hit gold. I only wish Singapore was not a 13 hour flight from London.I cannot urge you enough to visit this restaurant for lunch or dinner

For more pictures and an in depth review, please visit my blog: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/2013/7/16/esquinaMy husband I love tapas, and will go as as far as to say that Esquina offers the best tapas in town! Their dishes are always delicately executed and each one has its own unique, exquisite taste. Not to mention they boast a great selection of wine as well! We've tried several of their dishes, but I just keep going back to the Crispy baby squids with black ink aioli. The squids are bite sized and crunchy, whilst the batter is light and fluffy. I'm a fan of their Seafood paella as well which comes lathered on with snapper, sauteed gambas, chorizo & more squid! I'm not the only one who thinks Esquina serves up the best tapas in town, so be sure to get there by 6:30 on a weekend if you want to snag a seat by the bar (which is the best place to be!) Unfortunately, they don't take any reservations. For my take on their clams, Spanish breakfast, roasted beef short ribs, lamb rump and dessert, please visit my blog in the link above

We heard about Esquina through a friend. The restaurant is busy. Since one cannot book a table, early is best if you want prompt seating. While enjoying numerous glasses of their moreish sangria, we waited 30mins to be seated at the bar overlooking the prep area (note this was a Thurs night). The chefs work in unison at a frenetic pace, preparing exquisite tapas and more. The restaurant although very small, generates a tremendous vibe. The food was very good indeed. The scallop ceviche and the sea urchin and crab bisque were standouts, add to that the lovely croquettes and baby squid, you certainly get authentic Spanish fair. Esquina although tiny packs a massive punch

Great little place with wonderful atmospher and energy. We ate the Iberico sliders, oysters, Romanian salad, Seviche, sourdough with aioli, Tbone special, the paella, churros dessert, peanut butter jam dessert, chocolate tea ice cream. Along with this we had sangria & espresso. Wow. Wow. Wow. The food was so wonderful. A mixture of textures, and flavours and such great presentation. The experience was absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend sitting at the bar inside so you can watch the chefs, be part of the action and fun and hear the music. Upon leaving, ask the waitress / chef for the password to library bar (< 2 minutes walk away) and I recommend you go there next for a drink!

Friend recommended this little hidden tapas bar, ironic as its in the middle of China town. Regardless, its a fun and well decored place. As for the food, a great variety and catering for different taste. Definitely, dont miss as the food was excellent. And when done, and if you fancy a night cap, dont miss following on at the "Library".
4
As soon you enter, you are not in Asia anymore... Don't hesitate to try it all as all is very good and very well presented. Make sure to sit at the bar for a great ambiance. The only negative comment I can say is the poor choice of Spanish wine. The rest ... Be happy and enjoy. Oh yes , when you finish your diner and wine, ask the staff to take you to the Library... You will not regret..

great food and place to hang out and catch up with friends. feast for the eyes and tummy. Service is good as well. I like that they don't take reservations, first come first serve. My favourite dessert is the churros
5
Went to Esquina on a whim for lunch and have to say it was superb in all respects.The venue is (and I hate the expression but it works),sort of shabby chic/industrial with the key feature being the counter where you sit on old style tractor iron seats watching your meal being prepared. Sounds uncomfortable? Exactly the opposite ! The service & style is very informal and friendly but discretely super efficient.Andrew Walsh the Executive Chef is very much in evidence and engages jovially with clientele taking time to explain the subtleties of each dish and encourages the informality. We had the set lunch option,very reasonable for 3 courses at $40 but could not resist the temptation of the exquisite sea urchin and crab bisque and scallop ceviche with yuzu ponzu.Everything from this kitchen and I mean everything develops new subtleties of flavour topped by elegant but unpretentious presentation. Of course its also partly a Jason Atherton restaurant but Walsh is clearly in charge. Oh,and suspend your biases and negatives about tapas you had on holiday in Spain please.This is phenomenally good dining
4
Admittedly, I was skeptical since this is part of a well-known chef's many restaurants. We ordered the ribeye (just 180g for S$42), beetroot salad and scallop ceviche. The latter two dishes were surprisingly good! Beetroot salad was very well-executed, while the scallop ceviche was one of the best I have ever tasted (most scallop ceviches I had tend to be rubbery or leathery).This tapas restaurant is definitely one option I would keep in mind to visit again, though it really isn't your traditional tapas
5
The amount of depth this team goes through to put the P in personal touch is clearly breath taking .. Can't complain as there is noting to complain about... Great place food and great job.. Ash.
4
We went on sat 730 pm so got an outside table without waiting but can imagine the atmosphere inside would have been better. A little difficult to catch the waiters attention but ok overall. We also had come across a very grumpy looking waitress as well.Food however was amazing - scallop ceviche, steak tartare , chicken wings and Spanish breakfast all very well executed and imaginative Not sure if it is our best tapas but better than our experience at catalunya in terms of food If you like esquina u should also try dad
5
My wife who is a small eater called the servings delectable samples. The experience is heightened by being able to watch them make the food. Everything was outstanding.
5
This place is an absolute gem. They don't take bookings and you will wait an exceedingly long time for a table - we waited 1.5 hours - but it's absolutely worth it (grab a drink at The Cufflink Club down the road and they'll call you when your table is ready). The chef is an exceptional talent. Their wine list needs work (it's solid but tiny) but that's the only fault I can find. Eat here, you'll love it
3
The joint itself had very good atmosphere and certainly was very buzzy when we were there. I found the food a little too salty for my liking and it was consistently so across the various dishes we tried. I will try again next time to see if its still the case but the crowd here, if nothing else, is happenin
4
Had a fabulous meal at Esquina. Arrived early and were seated in a temporary area until better seats were available but no problem and the system worked well. Found the staff to be extremely helpful, attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. We let chef decide the selection of dishes and were not disappointed with the exception of the basil ice cream dessert which none of us loved!We also appreciated the choice of music so altogether a great evening out
5
This is the first time we visited Esquina after having heard about the place. We had a bottle of white wine and several dishes. The food presentation was good and the food delicious. I personally liked the oysters and mackerel ceviche.The staff are generally friendly and attentive.Overall a pleasant experience
3
We have eaten at several of Jason Atherton's restaurants and so we were eager to eat here. First problem there's no reservations - so we were sent to an associated bar The Library for drinks which frankly I didn't want to wait for 45 minutes for a "table". There are very few tables in the restaurant, most are seats at the bar overlooking the chefs preparing the food. Visually it's great and I spent a lot of time people watching and enjoying the frenetic pace.I've got to say that the tapas was pretty uninspiring, nothing wrong with it at all but also nothing that special - my husband had the sea urchin and he said it was ok but he wouldn't order it again - I think that would sum up most of the dishes we ate.I think this might be nicer when it is less trendy and becomes nothing more than a local tapas bar - at the moment it is too bus
1
Its a nice place for the food and atmosphere. But the service is super terrible especially the tall watiress..... Without smile on the face n very unfriendly. I wont come again. Sorry. Very bad dinning experience
3
Visiting friends friends in Singapore we started of at the Esquina, tapas restaurant with head chef Jason Atherton himself preparing fantastic dishes from the bar in plain view. Being three we soon encountered first problem, the bar stools are bolted to the floor, which is very inflexible, so it ended with one of standing, which sort of worked, since more friends arrived.Loved the food. Especially the ox cheek oloroso. But let my rewind a bit - while waiting for our seating we enjoyed share of jamon iberico and green peppers - which were off - and later in the evening - sent two in the party directly to the lavatory. Not good.So excellent in atmosphere and food - except from the bad peppers - and wine and decor. I like the place and the bar. A plus of course was Mister Miyaki sitting 5 seat down
5
This is a fun rewarding experience. Tucked away in a neat little neighborhood bordering China town chef Andrew Walsh creates wonderful dishes that excite the senses. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared cleverly presented exceptionally. We admired the careful meticulous execution by the entire team working in harmony to perform a unique symphony to 20 foodies at a time. The clientele is sprinkled with locals and all are eager to share their take on the dishes, food & wine experiences engaging in lively conversation. A truly enjoyable must do experience
4
Had a great lunch with wife. Food was delish, well prepared and tasty. The metal stools was a bit uncomfortable, however is great to see the chefs in action and your food is being prepared in front of you. Love the crispy baby squid with the squid ink and the grilled rib eye. Nice presentation. Dessert was ok. So i will recommend the savorie
3
Esquina has all the makings of a really good restaurant. Great location, predictably styled interior and a nice casual feel about it with the vintage stools and low tables outside. Interesting menu. And someone's name attached to it. The music was great too. Apart from that.. It was a huge disappointment. For starters when we went last weekend, just about all the staff were sullen with not even a smile to be found anywhere. A mood killer for whatever vibe they were going for. Service wasnt the best. It's not a big ask to expect your servers to remember what you ordered in a small restaurant like this .. Instead we got a parade of dishes prefaced with .."did you order this?".. Many of which were for other tables. Annoying. The menu does read well and sounded inventive. We tried the squid ink paella, beet root and burata salad, the lamb and beef. They were mostly just ok not spectacular. It's all small plates here. Tiny portions. Which makes it a very overpriced overhyped and underwhelming experience. Surely there are better places in Singapore.
5
We went to this place during lunch. Its a small place with open kitchen concept. Edgy, rustic and with some cool vintage posters as decoration. What we like the most about this place was seeing how passionate all the chefs with the creation of the foods. Make you more appreciate of the food you will eat. We ordered: Sea urchinCrispy baby squid with blank ink Grilled rib eye Empanadas (forgot the name)Chocolate ice creamAnd japanese green tea for the dessertThs highlight for us was the empanadas, it came with a very delicate and delicious sauce, we love the baby squid ink as well. Woulc love to order some more but their food are not cheap. I would say this place is nice for special occasion
5
Just great from beginning to end. Difficult to get a table but its a small place so what do you expect. Deal with it. It's worth the wait. The pork belly was outstanding and the manchego custard shod have been an appetizer it was so good should not be missed. Service was good and appropriate not overboard but adequate. Stupidly I left my bag there and the waitress ran 2 blocks to catch up with me to return it. And only towards the end did I know it was related to jason Atherton. Awesome must go!
5
I wondered where the other people had gone on reading some of the other reviews. Having tried (and enjoyed) Pollen and Keong Saik Snacks, Esquina was next on our list. We arrived mid-service with the place packed. The staff were awesome. The found us a corner to have a drink and taste some great nibbles whilst we awaited a spot at the bar. The tapas (yes was different) but boy was it delicious! The foie gras burgers were wonderful. The service/ staff could not have been better and always smiling. The team making preparations a dream to what. And the head chef, very personable. Didn't see any favoritism amongst the seating queue. Do yourself a favour and go! Great food, funky vibe, great customer service
1
We waited almost 2 hours to get somewhere to sit, after that it took additional 15 minutes just to order (arrived short after 19). Again and again the said just 10 more minutes. Reading the reviews and about the owners in a magazine, we had high expectations. The place was cool, liked the music and the way it was organized, the food looked great, but the taste did not live up to it. I would not recommend anyone to go there for the food. Reading the menu, the food seemed fabulous with the mix of tastes, but eating it it was hard to distinguish the different tastes. If you want a nice glas of wine, go there, as long as you not are hungry and want some food, because it takes time and looks much better then it tastes
3
It amazes me how some restaurants develop an aura of mystique that in no way relates to the quality of the food (average), the service (terse) or the ambience (big city diner at peak hour). This offspring of Pollen Street Social has mystique but absolutely no substance, and all I can pin its success down to is that it is a tiny space full of well healed tourists and you need to wait for ages to get a seat - ergo, it must be good. Sorry to say it isn't. It is overworked, self conscious cookery - quasi Spanish cooked by a quasi Spanish team of cooks. More theatre than cuisine. The concept is tapas, but tapas it is not - tapas bars are relaxed and friendly places as a rule, but Equinas is extraordinarily stressful dining - rushed, crowded, arrogant and sweaty (mis- termed "infectious energy" in the review that I read). The best things about the place are the sangria, and a dessert of frozen yoghurt, pumpkin polenta cake crumbs and spiced apricot that is exquisite. And be warned - the staff will seat their friends ahead of you. I've never come across so many irate people hanging in there and waiting for a spare seat despite being humiliated
4
Well i must say I totally enjoyed dining here. Went at 6 so there were ample seats for my friend and I to choose. Friendly and personalised service from the waiting staff. Food was good but more fusion/modern kinda dishes with very unique tastes (yuzu/toffee/almond, not very traditional Spanish stuff) instead of traditional Spain tapas menu. So in that sense, was a lil disappointed cause I do miss some good tapas from Spain.A lil pricey though - tapas serving, main course price.Ambience - small, like Spain's tapas bar but modern and slightly more classy.Must try - Sangria and the Chicken Wings (i think it was toffee apple something)Will head back again though not often cause of price tag
2
be prepared to pay high prices for poor Tapas, good vibe but will have no space anywhere to sit or put your drink down.Service was friendly and better then expected in such crowded tiny place.The Tapas are over priced, presentation is good, but most of the dishes had no balance, mostly to much salt in everything.the classic tomato bread was the worst in years i had and the bone marrow is a single bone staffed, really sad that the website and actual dishes did not matc

Came to this restaurant, recommended by a friend who loves the wine. I am not a wine person, unfortunately but I do like a good grub. But he did warn me that the service can be very abrupt during peak dinner hours and expect to pay for what you (don't) get.I have visited Jason Artherton's Pollen Street Social in UK and sort of knew what to expect: good fuss free food with freshiest of ingredients.We came without a booking, 15 mins before opening. Was asked to sit outside with a drink and wait out that 10-15 mins before the restaurant is OFFICIALLY open to service. Fine, I respect that. But we could hear the chef telling the server off for letting us sit down (something about being full and etc...) Rather intimidating?? A gordon ramsey wannabe?? I duuno. It felt uncomfortable.We were told we could have an early dinner and must vacate the table by 7pm, which is fine, since we are both fast diners. The food came and it was goodt. Expensive, but good food. Its not really a traditional tapas bar. But rather, a fancy upmarket tapas bar with good, fresh ingredients. Most dishes averages $28+.Expensive for the portion. But I guess it's 'tapas' afterall....The ambience is hurried, "go-there-to-be-seen" place", but the food certainly does make up for the rushed service, or none there of. Most servers looked stressed and unhappy to deal with queries. Tthere are better dining options in that area. Another tapas bar : The Reading Room for example,has very good wine selection and just as good, but much cheaper tapas. And Taratata French Bistro just a few steps away, serves up goodt french food. Go there especially for their great value lunch menu! And then there is The Clan...the list goes on. That area is a haven for great food establishment, so there is no need to pay through the nose for good food if you are in that area.Would go there again, just for the food. Will ignore the service and the portion size. JUST ORDER 2 SERVES for things you like !

This is one of my favourite places to eat in Singapore and just about anywhere else for that matter. A high quality food experience, the flavours and ingredients all prepared before your eyes - ask the team about anything and you will learn what it is you are eating and even why they pair ingredients. Always a good soundtrack in the background and enough curiosities in the decoration to make a conversation point should things go flat whilst waiting to be fed.The floor staff are exceptional and a real stand out against Singapore's restaurant service in general. I always go for the Albarino wine; not many places serve it and it's delicious.My recommendation is to go in pairs only to ensure a speedier seating. I don't understand why people are complaining about the wait - it's because it's awesome...... The price is fair for what they offer also.Highly recommended - i thought twice about reviewing and inflating popularity, but that would be too selfish
4
You'll probably have to wait an hour or so to get a seat - and you'll probably have to part with $300 before you leave - but i think it's worth it if you sit at the bar. The food is very good and the meticulous precision that goes into each dish is evident if you prop at the bar and watch the brutish head chef deliberate over every detail of every dish - and unceremoniously abuse anyone in the kitchen who's getting it wrong. It's comforting to know they care - and they charge through the noee for this comfort. Still, we eat there at least once a month and enjoy the theatre of the show as much as we do the fantastic food
4
After walking past it a few times at night when it was packed, decided to turn up before it opened at noon today, Feb 14th. At 11.55, almost all the outside seats were occupied, while they were getting ready inside. About half the expectant lunchers had beers or wines, so they open early for drinks. Our party of 4 managed to get seated inside, split between the counter facing the chef and assistants, and a high table. It is cramped, both for the customers and staff. You get to see and HEAR the food being prepared. There is a lot of activity as the food is pretty much made to order, and there are a lot of ingredients to each dish (see the menu on the website). This is not traditional tapas, but what I call "too many ingredients cooking" in tapas portions. It's tasty, but too complicated for my taste. The flavours of the main ingredients, which look fresh and top quality, get lost in the complication. Portions are small, and prices are fairly steep, though there is no 10% service charge. GST at 7% is added. The bill came to SGD166.90, and we wanted to top up with mee pok close by, but it was pouring with rain.Turn up before opening time to have a chance of a seat, Tuesdays for dinner. A lot of our fellow diners were regulars. I won't be one, though I'm glad I came to see why it is so popular
5
Too often in Singapore we get style over substance in so many things, especially in some of the over hyped restaurants. I am pleased to say that in Esquina we get what a restaurant should provide.. GREAT FOOD. It is not the place to stare into your loved one's eyes (unless you get one of the few small tables available) or perhaps whisper sweet nothings (you may have to shout), but you will have fun. We love sitting at the counter watching the creations being put together. Had ham croquetas; veal empanadas; salt and pepper squid with squid ink aioli; sauteed gambas, chilli garlic, potato dumplings, bisque sauce; roast pork belly "lasagne" and the foie gras burger. All excellent, wonderful combinations of flavours. Could perhaps offer more wines by the glass and one or two more sherries BUT these are minor quibbles.. Second visit.. will return more often
5
There is a great vibe in this restaurant. The bar dining affords a great view of the chefs at work and brings a flavour of the down to earth bars in Spain where the tapas is prepared behind the counter (sadly it's not free with a drink here!).The paella is delicious and we enjoyed the platter of charcuterieThe prices are not small but the portions are so you may want to try a few plates each - we spend around $300 for two with drinks.Don't plan on this being a cheap night ou
3
Some have said that one should arrive early to get a seat especially on Fri/Sat or be prepared to queue. Ironically, we promptly arrive at 6pm but it was only ready for service after 15minutes. The place was about 80% full and the service was insincere for some. For more details : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/12/esquina-spanish-tapas-or-dimsum.htmlThere were both hits and misses with the food but one gripe is that the size really can be afforded to be more generous even though they are tapas. Otherwise, it might be better to charge tapas price for tapas rather than main course prices for tapas.Foodwise, it was acceptable to me to experiment with the new creations but not for The Folks who commented that they had no idea what they were eating that night. Perhaps Spanish tapas might not be the cup of tea for everyone but I shall still continue to search for one that will be comfortable not only to the tastebuds but also to our stomachs and pocket

For pictures and more reviews, visit my blog Ms-skinnyfatEsquina is a haute tapas boutique where patrons perch precariously on weirdly shaped metal stools that will seriously damage some nuts. Not a place for large groups because you can hardly converse farther than your immediate left/right. Ham Croquetas ($10) is my must order. 4.5cm tall balls filled with creamy bechamel and chunks of what is possibly iberico ham (i expect no less) left us wanting for more. The ham was a little salty but i love it.The Smoked Haddock, spring onion and Manchego omelette ($18) was the fluffiest eggs i've tried in a while. I would liken it to a souffle but firmer. The taste was light; simply flavored with the natural sweetness of the smoked haddock. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.Do order the Sauteed gambas, chili garlic, potato dumplings and bisque sauce ($24) even though it doesn't look spectacular. The prawns were fresh and bouncy and i love the rich bisque sauce so much i could inhale it. Gnocchi were meh.And oh.. the Beef Tartare.. simply divine... Extremely flavorful and smooth tartare, especially after you scoop the confit egg yolk onto it....Read more over at my blog

The title of this review is what my date said about Esquina. This small restaurant is extremely well staffed and all of them are friendly and do care about what you like. They are all very personable and provide an experience with restaurant staff rarely seen in Singapore.Food is excellent and very fresh. As they are well staffed, you never have to wait too long for the food or get some friendly attention. Ask the staff which special of the day are worth trying and you get an honest answer. Must try items on the menu are foie gras burger, the raw tuna (cannot remember the full name) dish, fresh oysters.
5
Esquina, after 2 visits in as many months is my Singapore favorite. I'm Dutch so used to/love tiny over crowded places but the real reason for my love affair of this place is its food and the kitchen staff. Each dish is delicious, with the tuna one my recommendation. You can't book and I wouldn't go here with more than 2 people because sitting at the bar is pretty much all you can do. You'll be mesmerized by the chefs assembling your plates right in front of you but those plates will get your juices going and tongue wagging. Wash it down with a wine from the smallish wine list and you're in for a great night out. Def be prepared for a bit of sticker shock (300-400$ for 2 if you're drinking) but its well worth it ! Around the corner Cufflinks can brew up a mean cocktail if you find the wait too long.
5
This was our last meal in Singapore. It was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.
Food was so fresh and cooked right in front of your eyes!
Highly recommend for both food and the experience!
5
Great, diverse, fresh food. Served quickly in a vibrant setting. Well designed location. Great value for money. Overall great place!
5
Have just eaten an amazing array of dishes at Esquina overseen by the very friendly and capable Andrew Walsh ( Yes Yorkshire rhubarb would be a great addition to the menu if you could get it!) Thanks for a lovely evening Andrew and staff especially the nightcaps at 'The Library'......great idea
5
I went to Esquina yesterday with a friend for lunch as the weather was shoddy and we needed an outing. Gorgeous, just gorgeous. Loved ever mouthful of the salted squid with ink aioli and the succulent raw tuna. Flavours were fresh and unique. The basil gelato with freshly grilled pineapple was just fabulous. The wine was a little expensive, but it was cold and went beautifully with our meal. The chefs were friendly and offered all sorts of interesting information in the open style counter and kitchen design. We were lucky to be sitting beside a lovely Singaporean couple who told us all about their favourite Singapore restaurants and where we should try next. They also very kindly offered us a beautiful hot fresh donut that they had picked up from the sister restaurant of Esquina just down the road. We will defiantly be taking their advice. Will definitely be returning to Esquina for dinner with the husbands
5
I almost cried at the exquisite flavours of the iberico pork and foie gras burger...unbelievable! The chefs seem to almost work just for you. Squid was also fab, Had lots of dishes and lots of wine. It was a little ott in pricing I thought - but loved the food so much I'll be back, plus looking forward to going to 22 Ships newly opened in HK. The deserts, esp the orange marmalade toasted brioche, were amazing - and the chef slipped us a few free tasters. The lovely manageress was so welcoming, although one of the staff could have done with being able to explain the specials a bit better! We got there at 9.20 and had no probs getting seats for 2 on a thursday, also there were tables outside

Esquina, a sliver of a restaurant in a part of Chinatown, away from tourists and tourist-trap vending stalls, provides a tapas-style menu in a non-Spanish styleenvironment. This is my fourth or fifth visit this year and it has quickly grown into one of my favs in Singapore. What I like about the place is that it has an open kitchen- actually the open kitchen is the other side of the long-counter bar. There are only a few 2-top tables away from the bar in the tiny restaurant. Otherwise, there are a few tables outside; but who wants to sit outside in hot and humid Singapore weather. I enjoy sitting at the bar and interacting with the chefs who are preparing and cooking the meals. The food is tasty, well presented and suitable for sharing with your dining companion. They have a decent selection of wines, which I have partaken of each time I have dined there. Their furnishings remind me of quirky antique shop finds one would see in Santa Fe, Portland, or Austin in the U.S. If I could upload photos on the trip advisor iPhone app, I would upload photos of the food, but I am not sure that this app allows it. Esquina is not a recommended venue for a big party. A dinner for two is ideal. Dinner for four may be cumbersome at the bar, unless you grab the seats at the corner of the bar, or you can grab a little table outside and the party of four huddles around it. When my hubby and I discuss where to go out for dinner, esquina usually comes up. The only reason we do not go there every week is because we do not live in Chinatown and we can only eat Iberico jamon, beautiful beet salad, oysters, mini burgers and drain couple bottles of wine in moderation..
4
I perform horribly at Tapas bars, meaning I always overeat and over spend. With the lack of a proper "Starters, Mains and Desserts" structure for a meal, I find myself over ordering and over eating. Which is a happy problem at Esquina because the staff is amazing, the crowd is cool and slightly rowdy, the place smells amazing and you are constantly entertained with chefs darting around getting the food ready. Must try the Spanish breakfast.. runny eggs and iberico ham is simply heavenly
3
But have to say its average. Not bad and food prepared with care, but nothing popped. I am still waiting for someone to open a really authentic tapas bar in Singapore, something at the level of a Cal Pep, perhaps that's too big an ask.Ps place is small and does not take reservations, go early to avoid a long wait
5
I have eaten in Esquina now 5 or 6 times, lost count! It just gets better. There are so many dishes that I love so much that I order them again and again and still have some dishes that are on my must try list! I have eaten in sister restaurants Pollen Singapore and Pollen Street Social London and both are superb restaurants but both very formal in atmoshere and service. Without a doubt I prefer the atmosphere in Esquina and the food is equally as good. A very friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. All the guests are relaxed and often share their experience with neighbours at the counter. A must visit whenever I am in town
4
Set in a converted shopfront in China town, Esquina opened in late 2011 and has been attracting diners by the hundreds each and every night. The restaurant has a strong pedigree with a founder who has worked and learned for the best chefs in the world and an executive chef from a similar schooling. The premises are relatively small with diners packed in tightly inside (for those who want to se the chef in action and enjoy a little aircon) or more comfortably outside for a more Spanish alfresco kinda feel. The food, chosen from a well laid but simple menu, is very tasty and well presented. This isn't your standard dull tapas though! The chef has given quite a bit of thought to the dishes which are a reward for the taste buds. The wine list, while not too fancy, will accommodate all preferences. Service is attentive and probably right for a restaurant that seems to have figured out how to serve premium tapas in a trendy setting
4
Singapore's latest and most popular tapas bar. Great choice from an eclectic menu. Wine list is good (choice adequate but not extensive)Inside there an open kitchen with long bar- full of vitality and atmosphere with the brigade of chefs led by executive chef Andy WalahOutside a slightly more related vibe.Service is good. Staff are friendly. Menus is delicious - I reccomend the Iberian pork and foie gras burger and the Grilled rib ey
5
There's something you got to love about the audacity of opening a tapas bar smack in the centre of Chinatown when logic dictates it might be better sited in Orchard Road. It's fun to get a seat at the counter because this is where the action is. Great theatre to watch the chefs at work. I went alone once & eat with a friend on the second visit. Definitely recommend more than one as that allows you to try more things. The food was on the whole tasty & definitely moreish - hame & cheese croquettas, heirloom tomato salad, deep friend calamari, crispy skinned sea bass, succulent roast pork, prawns in a tomato broth, thin slices of a wonderfully salty jamon, marinated olives. All washed down with a cold glass of fino. What more can one ask except to have a pistachio cake as well as roasted pineapple for dessert. This tapas bar comes with an excellent pedigree as it's chef owner is Jason Atherton, of London's Pollen Street Social as well as the newly open Pollen at our very own Gardens by the Bay. Definitely worth a return visit or two. Ole!
4
Loved it. Was sitting with gfs on the corridor outside, very atmospheric. The food was generally good, if a not small the portions. We shared a bottle of wine, and another glass of dessert wine/drink each, and came up to approximately $60 per pax, which to me was pretty good value in Singapore. The restaurant made me think of Polpo, and Barrafina in London. Very nice, I'll go back

This is a tapas bar at Singapore China Town. The restaurant offers a venue that is different, as you probably would sit by the bar, watching the open kitchen right in front of you. This kind of arrangement could be good for couples. However if you are three or more you would not mingle enough by sitting in line at the bar,... You could sit in one of the two other high tables inside the restaurant, or at the outside tables, that are in general only good for finger casual food, and they are exposed to Singapore heat. If you want a different, alive place for a couple's dinner and you don't mind paying about S$150 per head (in order to fill any full) this is a good place to explore. Food taste is very good, just the portions are so small,... And the wine list is very good indeed, however a bit expensive, when the cheapest decent option would cost you S$80 or so

As my title suggests those looking for a dining establishment with an immediate,off the street seat at 8.30pm for more than 2 people and attentive table service would be better off at an alternate venue. This as a concept is more attuned to those looking for a more fine dining tapas experience with a range of dishes/plates from rich and filling (mini Pork and Foie Gras burgers) through to an exquisite and refreshing( Seville and Rosemary ice cream with marmalade toast). A modern and reasonably expensive taste on tapas granted but equally balanced by a filling,satisfying and enjoyable evening out. We arrived early,got a seat at the bar,enjoyed a pre dinner drink of Sangria and chose 4-5 dishes from the menu that sated our appetite for a hungry post work couple. An earlier review spoke of this being a glorified hawker stall and that being the case can they let me know where they get there chicken rice and Hokkien Prawn Mee as this is at the other end of the spectrum. The venue is cosy and atmospheric not cramped, the service good and efficient not intrusive in any way. The chefs cook,plate and serve in front of you if you are at the bar (which is recommended) and have the right mix of surliness,efficiency and proximity that makes you feel like you are in their kitchen....which effectively you are. Jason Atherton helmed gives this restaurant a touch of class and dining quality that ensures you feel full,satisfied and rewarded for taking the time to have a light lunch beforehand so you can get down here early to appreciate all it has to offer

I can still taste the food in my mouth. The flavours were fantastic. The service was good. I would pay a little more and have a food experience like that every day of the week than go to the endless mediocre restaurants in Singapore. Bravo for bringing us something different

Esquina in Singapore is really a hawker stall disguised as a tapas bar. Reservations? Not allowed. Chope? Allowed. They should go study the way real tapas bars are run in Spain. The locals would stone you the waiters to death for allowing Singaporeans to "chops." Never again

My husband and I visited this bar while in Singapore recently and really loved the food. We had to wait around 20 minutes or so for a table inside and yes, the stools are not the most comfortable but it was worth it. We loved everything we ate - concentrating on the specials. Service was faultless. Would definitely go here again

I have a love hate relationship with Esquina, I absolutely love the food, it is a bit on the pricey side but it is modern tapas, and so tasty. I hate the waiting for a table, I have been twice now and both times had to wait nearly an hour. However I have spoken to various people and they have stated they have never had to wait for a table, it really is dependent on the time you get there and the size of your group. The wait wouldn't be so bad if you received the drinks and nibbles you ordered while waiting in a decent time. You seem to be very dependent on who is serving you, some of the staff are excellent and cannot fault them, some are distinctly under par. Last time the gentleman in the group had finished their bottles of beer before the ladies had received even the glasses for their bottle of wine, it took 30 mins, the boys weren't drinking fast. I know they can't take bookings as there is only 35 pax, but I think they need to start turning people away when the waiting list gets too long or expand

There are a couple of things wrong with this place. Mind you, the food is good. Not outstanding, but pretty good quality. It's just that nothing in this restaurant really fits together. From the point of view of it being a tapas bar, there were simply too few of the typical classics that I would expect - no marinated sardines, no pimientos and even the jamon iberico was not cut by hand, but rather by machine.Then the fancy aspect - you can clearly see from the menu that they try for a posh touch, with oysters and foie gras abundant. But all of the dishes were missing something in that regard, they didn't feel in any way rounded. The foie gras was mostly overpowered, for example.Last but not least, the overall service quality doesn't match up with the price they charge. Being squeezed into a small back corner, which wouldn't even happen in the middle of the Rambla in Barcelona, and then being almost thrown out after spending in excess of 300$ with the words "there is a waiting list for this table" is clearly off. I won't be going to that place in the foreseeable future again
