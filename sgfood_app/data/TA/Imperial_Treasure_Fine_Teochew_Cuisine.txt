Fascinating & made all more interesting by a fascinating man in the Hindu temple who brought hinduism doctrine and practice to life.

Busy restaurant full of Singaporeans, very good range of dishes served which were ali either good or excellent. Slightly marred but substandard service in a restaurant with such rating

This restaurant was previously located at the Takashimaya complex and moved to its ION Orchard location about two years ago. There we had one of best ChiuChao soya duck on each previous visits over the last 6 years or so. So we asked our local friends to book this restaurant, and even reserved a full duck at time of booking. (Once we were told this was so out early in the evening, hence the preorder).Found out by chance on the day of this visit that it had actually been awarded a 1-Michelin Star only 2 months ago. First reaction was : does that mean higher prices? The prices turned out quite reasonable.The restaurant has a modern and spacious seating and gives a warm welcoming first impression, walking past the “hanging duck” gallery showcasing their delicious Soya ducks, crabs, and other cold dish goodies at the chopping station to whet one’s appetite on the way to the table.The traditional tidbits of preserved sweet & sour mustard cabbage were very tasty, and opening traditional kungfu tieguangyin tea goes well with it.The duck proved to be beautifully prepared and tasty as we (party of 6) expected. The other cold starter was a mixed platter of pigs ears (very tenderly finished with a nice soft yet crunchy bite), the soya large intestines were delicious and the sliced squid all very tasty.The sea cucumber stuffed with minced pork (served per person) was absolutely delicious with a strong approval by all in our party.We had steamed yellow croaker that was tasty, and clay pot frogs with ginger were also very nicely done with delicate flavour.The meal finished with a serve of plain doumiao (snow pea leaves) in a simple stir fry with garlic, and for dessert the typical well liked ChiuChao dessert “ornee” ( steamed taro paste ) that was not too sweet and smooth paste texture.Service was very attentive with a smile but not overly hovering, eating plates changed at the right time.Overall it was a great dinner experience with tasty food that were well prepared.Not sure if a 1-Michelin Star is deserved as the food were all traditional dishes prepared in a very professional yet wholesome way that brings me back to my childhood memories of typical ChiuChao food that is otherwise not so easily found these days at this quality level even in Singapore. Perhaps for this professional level of fine dining, they arguably deserve that 1-star recognition.Will definitely revisit

Dim sum is very good. We had the usual, Har gao, Siew mei, steam pork bun and egg tarts. All were great. We also had an amazing oyster and minced meat porridge which is a must order. I would also recommend the prawn paste chicken wings! The mushroom in oyster sauce was also good. Ambience is great, service is good too. Highly recommend!

Had late breakfast early lunch one day few days before cny.Food standard still good, worth to spendAll tim sum dishes are favourable, the goose with the ear and intestine was good.Love to dinner there. Staff are friendly and quick in action

We are big fans of the Imperial Treasure Group, and used to go to its first restaurant -the Teochew outlet at Ngee Ann City - at least once a month until it closed down towards the end of 2016. This is the first time we've been to the Ion Orchard branch. With the move, it has added "Fine" to its name, the menu is now more focused on Teochew dishes (many Cantonese dishes are gone, as well as the "Yin Yang" (tomato and cream sauces) fried rice which one of my sons loved), and prices have moved up. The decor is also more refined, but still very 'Imperial Treasure' in style - ie. elegant and understated, much less screaming than its counterparts at Crystal Jade and Paradise groups. What is somewhat unique is the most attentive and professional service by a loyal, low-turnover staff, who REMEMBER old customers like us by name, but treat all patrons with the same courtesy and efficiency. I believe Michelin inspectors are lousy at rating Asian restaurants (be it Chinese, Indian, or Japanese) anywhere (be it Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, or Paris, London), so I don't know if the one star here is well-deserved. There are many Chinese restaurants in Singapore which are as good as this one (in fact, I believe the Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck at Paragon is better, and the Imperial Treasure Shanghai at Ngee Ann City is as good), but for an overall dining experience (including service and ambience), this is certainly up there

Teochew cuisine originated from the eastern part of China's Guangdong Province. It bears similarities to that of Fujian cuisine. Although it is now influenced by Cantonese cuisine (most restaurants in China Town worldwide are serving Cantonese cuisine), a true foodie must try different Chinese cuisines to truly enjoy the wide range of creativity.It is served very delicately here where less oil is used in poaching, steaming and braising besides stir-frying and deep frying.We normally order from the à la carte menu. For this visit, we ordered a special set menu (S$98) serving around 10 courses for just one person (in contrast, many French and western restaurants with Michelin Star would demand that everyone at the table must order the same menu). In addition, we ordered glutinous rice roll, braised pig intestine (probably the best in Singapore), pan fried taro omelette (almost like a pizza), and a mess taro dessert served with steamed gingko nuts and almond sweet soup. They were our regular dishes.The best dishes served from the set menu were braised sea-cucumber with minced pork (probably the best in Singapore), deep fried minced prawn and black moss roll (probably the best in Singapore), steamed 'shi-liu' ball with abalone (the ball served with a shi-liu/pomegranate look), and stewed flat noodle with bitter gourd and minced beef (it did not sound good but it turned out to be a delicious creation by the chef).The taste and textual of the sautéed pomfret (a flat fish) fillet with Sichuan peppercorns was perfect except it was too salty. We informed the friendly staff who immediate asked the chef to reduce the salt content for other dishes.We like to thank all the staff at the restaurant, in particularly, Jacky, Alice, Connie, and Joanne. You can always ask Jacky to help you order dishes to suite your taste buds.Overall, another great lunch for us at this restaurant - one of our regular lunch places

As always, Imperial Treasure Teochew food is simply delicious . The new outlet at Tanjong Pagar Centre has a more intimate setting & the layout gives much more privacy.Speciality kung fu tea is nicely brewed & fragrant. The staff is efficient & welcoming. Had smoked eel & it was skilfully prepared & delicious. The fish maw with chestnut has nicely balanced favour. Compliments to the chef. The sommelier manager Jordi is such a delightful personality & his food & wine knowledge extensive. Look forward to the next meal there

Went there for a business lunch. This place was excellent for a business lunch as the ambiance was suitable and the staff very attentive. A special menu was arranged for our group.The starter was sliced duck with fried minced prawn ball. Not really an outstanding dish. The second dish was double boiled fish maw soup with chicken. The soup was slightly thick and tasted great. This was followed by 2 pieces of suckiling pig, It was the best dish of the day. The pork skin were thin and almost without any fat. It tasted excellent and was crispy. The best suckling pig I ever eaten. The steam Soon Hock fish was good but most good Chinese restaurant can produce this standard. The poached mustard green was average so was the fried Hor Fun. The dessert of mashed taro was also well prepared.This is a good restaurant but a little short of being excellent. Our lunch was also very pricy. May not return because it is a little expensive
4
I have been patronizing this restaurant since their previous location at Ngee Ann City, level 4. This restaurant gives guests a very pleasant and warmth feeling with its classy decorated interior and humble service.Prices are steep and be prepared to spent but it guarantee patrons with its fresh ingredients.It offers casual to fine cuisine. However, I am a bit disappointed that it doesn't offers traditional teochew dish - braised eight treasure vegetables.Nevetheless, it is one of the best restaurants worth trying
4
Great good, nice place. Their Dim Sum is good and variety choice. Great place for business lunch too.
5
This was the third visit of my wife's and mine to this restaurant and we had consistently quality level of experience.Food was delicious and true to the traditional Teochew taste that we remembered. Service was prompt, helpful, and pleasant.Ambience was nice with modern decoration to create a comfortable atmosphere.Some suggestions are:1. Highlighting the Teochew dishes or have a dedicated section on the menu, which currently is a mixture of both Teochew and others - this will help diners to distinguish;2. Order of dishes - of the three occasions, the entree arrived after the mains - this could affect the flow of the overall experience.3. The wait time of the bills and settlement - this needs to be more efficient.On balance it's still a pleasant dining experience
4
One floor below the steamboat place and also paradise dynasty - so glad to have another choice here. Private room. Great food. All our normal favorites. Nothing to complain about except for staff that kept walking in and out of room to serve us better.
5
Fabulous dinner tonight with family n extended family. Best meal on this stay in Singapore with great cold crab, delicately sliced duck, eel with slightly sweet sauce and traditional teochew dessert.
5
We were there for dinner and wasn't exactly crowded until much later. Service was very prompt and most of the staffs are very friendly. We had the bitter gourd and pok ribs claypot, salted egg prawn, and a whole hokkaido sea cucumber - all of it was delish and tasty! Food was well presented the honeydew sago was nice too, though a tad too sweet. It will be good if they may serve the dish one at a time rather than all at one shot, probably may check with the customers which do they prefer ; that will make the whole experience even better.I will love to come back again soon

@TheKuoKnowsImperial Treasure Noodle & Congee is a slighly more upmarket HK-style teashop that specialises in snacks.It's a great go-to place, if you want a quick no-fuss meal. Servive is efficient but its still best to avoid lunch hours, when the queues can be heartbreakingly long.The lunchtime crowd will usually disappear by around 2:30pm. The speciality of the house is the Roast Duck Noodles. They are very good. Just as good as you would get in HK.The Beef Noodles are worth trying too. The brisket is melt-in-the-mouth tasty. The noodles also have that unique Hong Kong texture

I arrived 5 minutes before my booking and was told to wait. Meanwhile, all the other parties who arrived after me were shown to their tables. My party arrived a few minutes later and I approached the counter to tell them my party was here. We were told to wait again. Now it was past 12 noon, my booking time. At 12:10, we asked again what the matter was and were told our table was not ready. At 12:15, I asked the staff again for our table and she said our table was still occupied by guests who were there for the first seating (at 11!) Then we knew there was no point waiting! We left the restaurant without even stepping into the restaurant. Throughout the 20 minutes, no staff member approached us to explain or apologise for making us wait. When we repeatedly asked for our table, there was also NO friendliness, no smiles, no no apologetic explanation , and there was minimal eye contact.  They did not show any respect to their guests.What kind of restaurant is this?
1
Overall experiences is below average. First, the service provided is not professional enough, from very tiny things like hot towel that is not even warm, service staff changing next table's table cloth with attitude. The service staffs checked our table probably 20 times for 1.5 hours dining (which we find disturbing). We ordered set menu with additional ala carte items. However, while we just start drinking soup, our first dishes, two other dishes were served. By the time we finish our soup, the other two dishes were not warm enough to be enjoyed. We had to stop the service staff to keep bringing us food because they seems rushing us to finish our dinner as soon as possible. Yet, our steamed cod fish was served before we even start to eat the current dishes. Second, the food quality was not up to expectation. Overall there is no "wow" factor, fish were over cooked, noodles were a little soggy. Third, I think as a Michelin starred restaurant. Paying attention to the details are crucial. When the food is served, the plate is quite dirty, stained with soup or gravy and oily fingerprints.

A quick business lunch in a rainy day. It's full and had to wait for 30 min to get a table of two. Great service and beautiful setting. Sea cucumber was an awesome dish not to be missed. Not cheap but worth the taste. Different types of chillies were served
1
I hated this restaurant. Not meant for westerners really, lots of Chinese people in private dining rooms seemed to be having a good time. I found the staff unhelpful and clueless regarding even the most basic requests/poor language skills for Singapore standards.. I was not welcomed nicely, one waiter tried his best but even he was mildly annoying.. everything was very expensive, noodles were basic and seemed like they came out of a ready pack.. desert that was recommended some type of boiled marrow speciality was disgusting.... go there if you want a page long menu of shark fin at a high price, don't go if you like tasty Chinese food at a reasonable price.. very disappointing. Amazing given this restaurant was in a major shopping centre no-one knew where I could get a cab from nearby (when I wandered around I found a sign in about 30 seconds within ion).. worse still the manager just didn't care and shook her head when a waiter asked her like it was a ridiculous request
4
I have been patronizing this restaurant quite regularly since early May 2017; before they got their first star. The decor is sophisticated & befitting a fine Chinese dining experience, particularly the larger gallery area with great views of Orchard Road. The dim sum definitely is more refined & in some cases the flavors more robust than most of the other luxury dim sum places in town. My favorites: the chong fun with a crispy filling & the succulent minced beef balls. As for the ala carte dishes, no particular favorites, but none have failed to meet my high expectations.Alan LeongSingapore

This is a true authentic chinese restaurant . Very good menu , service and food is great . Staff helpfull if you are new to this experience .

Dinner for 7 adults and 3 kids. We had the chilled crab, plain steamed fish with accompanying sauce, marinated meat combo - intestines, liver, duck, tofu, fried rice with char siew and prawns (very good), crispy fried noodles with vinegar and sugar - a signature teochew dish, sweet and sour pork (great), fried flat rice noodles (fantastic!) fried oyster omelette (good), oysters with lettuce cups, yam pudding and some mango dessert (great). The food was well presented and some dishes were good as indicated. They do 2 sittings for dinner, 6pm and 745pm. We went for the first sitting and had to end by 745pm so we felt a bit rushed. It was crowded and noisy on the Sunday night we were there
4
Modern and innovative Chaozhou style cuisine. Cooking was very fine and came with slight Cantonese twist. Excellent service - friendly, professional and attentive. I was quite impressed that they promptly change our wine glasses when a different bottle of wine was served. Ambient was classy and comfortable. Highly recommended
4
This restaurant was previously located in Takashimaya, however has since moved to ICON mall. It's one of chain Imperial Treasure restaurant, which is granted a One Michelin star, and this outlet specialised in Teochew cuisine. Their cold crabs and yam paste dessert are a must try
3
LocationLocated at Orchard Road (the busiest street in SG). PlaceIt has that traditional Chinese restaurant set up. Very grand and ambiance is good.Service Good but needs improvement. I asked for a cake to be kept and served later as a surprise cake for my Friend, in the end, the server brought the cake with me at the table and mentioned so loud about the surprise. Spoiler! They even serve it before I even requested! She's not even sorry.FoodGood taste, good quality,good quantity! Portioning is just nice!If not because of the service laps, I would have rated this 5.
5
From a humble and down-to-earth food, Imperial Treasure has elevated it to a top notch cuisine. Each dish supersedes the previous. Some of the memorable dishes are suckling pig, Mee Pok and mullet. This is definitely Teochew cuisine at its best
3
Had lunch and chose to order dishes that go with rice porridge. The steamed minced pork with salted fish was extremely salty. The omelette with radish was oily and might have been left in the kitchen for awhile as we were waiting for some time for some of the dishes. Service was pleasant and good but the kitchen was probably responsible for delay in serving the food at a good pace. We had to call the staff several times to get our food. The vegetables, long beans and mustard greens were well prepared.
5
The staff were excellent at Imperial Treasure. Can't ask for more on the attention that was provided at appropriate times. My favorite oyster or luak was sold out and I was unable to sample it. High marks given for the Or Nee desert, the braised duck, and the prawn with truffle egg white. Some of the dishes could be further improved.. such as the stir fry beef and the appertiser..
5
I scouted around Spore for a fine dining Teochew restaurant for my overseas teochew guests but there is not many to choose from. I finally settled for the Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine as it is located at ION Orchard and has good interior atmosphere.Locating next to Larry's Jewellery, one can easily miss the restaurant's entrance. The private room for 4 pax was about the right size but there is no window view. Ms Connie Ngan prepared a special menu which included steamed fish, braised duck & liver, oysters, minced abalone dumplings, sharkfins, etc. The huge flower crabs on display (at least twice the size you find in regular market) were simply too irresistible that we ordered two. The cold crabs were very meaty and sweet. Tasted so much better than Sri Lanka crabs! If you are a fan of duck liver, this is the place...melt like butter in your mouth but with a firm texture bite Simply deliciously shiok!It was a great overall dining experience and my guests loved it so much....especially the flower crabs and duck liver. But it burnt a huge hole in my pocket as the final bill came out >$300/pax. You pay for what you get.My guests whispered to me, brings me here again. Ouch!
5
This little restaurant inside the ion shopping mall although tiny in size serves the best duck and chicken dishes we have had in Singapore, staff are very attentive and look after you really well, explaining all the dishes on the menu and making sure you don't miss out by reserving the meal. Handy location for us as we were staying in Scott street and mall is just down the road. Menu is not huge but has a big range of food to try
4
If you want a quick lunch with noodles and roast meats, HK style, this is the place. Seating is orderly and by an issued number in a queue the moment you arrive. Don't expect a fine dining experience but a quick service place with lots of varieties of noodles and congee. I was craving for noodles so we ordered a plain soup noodle and combination roasted duck and pork dish. The chef recommendation - stewed chicken and liver in claypot is excellent. Will definitely return to try their "you tiao" or pastry with congee next time!
4
We had the braised duck. It was succulent and delicate. Imperial Treasure sure know how to treat a duck dish (like Super Peking Duck outlet)The best I have tasted to date. A must eat dish. We also had the fried treasure bag, crab claw and seaweed roll. All well done. Dinner was rounded up with the traditional Teochew yam dessert with pumpkin. Again I am speechless with the dish. What a grand finish to an exceptional dinner. Price ? What is it when you get such quality of cooking !!!Another great Imperial Treasure outlet. Nice ambience and service. Bravo !!
5
Love the warm and detail service. Food was good and memorable. It was awhile back so I can't remember what i had but i remember walking out happy with the overall food and service experience
4
We had noodles, congee and dumplings while waiting for our flight at Terminal 3 Changi Airport. I'm not a fan of noodles and congee but it's amazingly delicious. Not cheap but very filling. I'm not sure why this place called Imperial Noodles and Congee while the invoice showed Le Nu Noodles Bar and the order showed Paradise. Maybe they're from the same group of business
5
The food was generally good. The long beans with pork, the cubed beef with garlic and the "orh nee (yam paste)" were excellent. What stood out was the service. Ping Ying (hope I got her name right) was excellent. Gave good advice and patiently answered questions. The rest of the service staff were also extremely efficient and pleasant
4
Had lunch by myself . Excellent porridge- the best in Singapore . So creamy ! Always very busy and a you normally end up with a number and wait for a seat . Very popular and you see why.
2
It was my last night in Singapore and we wanted something quick to eat before an early night, for an early flight the next morning. We found this place and decided to try it. The wait staff was not friendly at all, and I ordered 2 different things off the menu and neither was good. The pork and chicken appeared to be under cooked and since I was going on a 17.5 hour flight I wasn't taking any chances. Finally just ordered shrimp soup. The shrimp were good, the soup wasn't
5
Was invited for a dinner on this fine Teochew Restaurant and it certainly lives up to its billing. The ambiance of the place was congenial especially for business discussion and family gatherings.We started off with an appetizer which is pork cooked until it became somewhat like Gelatin. We then had a combination of prawn balls, seaweed back and meatball which was surprisingly delicious. We also had long beans cook with minced pork which was the best I had tasted. The steam fish was good as well. And their speciality was a combination of duck meat, goose wings, pork intestines and bean curd. Also included were baby oysters, fried yam with seafood and it concluded with a spectacular yam pudding (or nee)All these dishes topped up with wine (Pinot noir) was exquisite.Would definitely recommend this place.
5
I have been only once in this restaurant and from my experience the food was tasty and at a reasonable price. The food was prepared really fast and overall it was a good experience
5
Ten for lunch in private room on a Sunday. , decor is modern , place is fully packed and busy . My local friend told me the Imperial Tresure group has taken over as the group,that provide the best cuisine and management in Singapore and overseas ( used to be Crystal Jade ).Service is very good . We have variety of dim sum ( refined quality ) , duck with Teachew style sauce ,sea cucumber with goose web , stirred fried turbo. , and champaign and red wine. . Excellent taste and superb quality. On par to be the best place to dine 
4
Of quality you would expect from this brand. Slightly different menu from other noodle house. If only the potion could be bigger
4
Had a memorable dining experience at Imperial Treasure to celebrate my birthday. Ordered teochew style steamed pomfret which tastes so heavenly that I kept drinking its soup stock! Love the sour plum flavor which makes my appetite very good . The fish is also quite fresh although it's a little pricey for the amount of meat served. We also ordered a Double platter consisting of crispy roasted pork and honey glazed tender char siew that comes with mustard. Do try their dim sum as they're also famous for it! We had the shrimp rice vermicelli （虾猪肠粉） which was comparable to Tim Ho Wan's standard. Finally we also had a plate of shrimp roe Ee Fu Mian which was surprisingly silky smooth that flavorful stock instead of the usual oily noodles from other mainstream shops. On the side note, the pickles and kungfu tea are served before your order arrives (but they are charged so you may want to request for no pickles or tea if you don't take them). Overall, service is good but can be improved in terms of their speed. Will be back next time to try other delicacies! Recommended for friends and family as they offer a wide array of food choices and is sufficiently spacious as well.

Friend bought us there,standard of food is good and ingredients are fresh.We had some dishes and some tim sum.We are a group of food lover like to try new foods.We have crab roll, prawn roll, wo kok ( yam pastry) har kow, siew mai teochew meatball, custard bun. We also order yu seng, ( cny season)teochew duck, yam pancake.All of the foods taste was really good. Service was also good because my friend was a regular of the restaurant. She has since recommend lots of friends to the outlet.I believe it will attrack more crowd if they has promotion with credit card because most people will choose dinning with extra frill. Especially dining in singapore is expensive with the ++

Simple, tasty and light, Teochew cuisine, has erstwhile been viewed as a less sophisticated cousin to Cantonese cuisine, which has quite some time ago broken into echelons of fine dining. Kudos to Imperial Treasure Teochew for successfully taking Teochew style upmarket and into the 21st century in a tasteful way. Rare feat. Teochew purists will approve the retention of the typical appetizer of preserved vegetable and little cups of brewed tea. Nice ambience, good service. Wine list looks quite full. Food quality is good. Would suggest that the menu, which has a lot of dishes both Teochew and Cantonese, could be trimmed to focus more on those of core Teochew character e.g. steamed pomfret, braised duck. Unfortunately did not have an opportunity to try those when I visited so hope to be back another time
5
we had lunch there, we had heard about the home made pork dumplings, they where so jammy so we had to order more
4
It was barely 11.30 am on Sunday morning & there was already a queue waiting to enter. We waited about 15 minutes for a table. We ordered braised vegetables with black mushroom, wanton noodle soup, stewed beef brisket, bbq pork neck, fish belly congee, prawn horfun with scrambled eggs & steamed glutinuous rice wrapped in lotus leaf. Everything met our expectations (on all our visits). The mushrooms are thick, tasty & fragrant & we love the al dente, springy noodles in clear, savoury broth, perfectly caramelised & succulent bbq pork, melt in mouth beef brisket, slightly charred horfun with big crunchy prawns ... Other recommendations include stewed vegetables in claypot with taro sauce, roasted duck, soya sauce chicken, steamed prawn dumplings ..
5
We were pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the Teochew food, which I would say is better than in most Teochew restaurants we've been to. Particularly memorable - the roast suckling pig, soy sauce braised duck and the pig stomach and pork rib soup. This is THE place for fine Teochew cuisine
4
This Imperial Treasure branch serves Teochew cuisine, which is rather uncommon compared to most Chinese restaurants that serve Cantonese or Hainanese. Overall food is good. Very flavorful and hit the palate right away. Service is great too.
4
Prompt service and food was pretty okay. Didn't like the Stewed Promfet Fish Dish though, was a bit bland for me. The Ee fu noodles was quite tasty. Service wise, it was pretty good as they regularly topped up the tea
4
Unpretentious Chinese. Good Dim Sum, efficient service and good value. Roast duck excellent. Always a line of people waiting for tables - a good sign
5
Certainly worth the visit and price. One of the best congee ever tasted in Singapore!
Smooth, piping warm and delicious. Ordered with pig liver and century egg. The crispy you tiao tops off the taste. (;
3
This place is a non fuss, quick place to have some good Chinese noodles and congee. Dim Sum is ok too.
4
Quality yet affordable chinese food. Try glutinous rice with salted egg. special instructions for eating: get a bite size then top it with soy sauce and add some sugar. You ll be surprised with the wonderful combination of tastes!I also tried the combination noodles with roasted duck and soy chicken. The duck was good but what impressed me was the soy chicken. Just the right balance of sweet and salty
5
from takashimaya to ion, this evergreen Teochew restaurant stills believes in Bring your Own with no corkage charges and serving up it all times favorites such as the XO braised mee pok, roasted meat, empress chicken, and the whole army of Teochew fried and marinated appetizers
5
My favourite Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. It is used to be on the 4th floor of Ngee Anee City.Popular dishes include 白饭鱼，卤水拼盘，猪肚汤，冻蟹，香港芥兰。Senior Manager, Jacky, is always helpful with his awesome food recommendations
5
Our family almost came here 2/3 times per week, and they got great food and amazing services, everybody here is really helpful with the kids, and our kids are familiar with the whole staff here already. we strongly recommended this place as good lunch and dinner for weekend and weekdays
3
This seems to be the motto of the staff here! It brings a whole new meaning to fast food and whilst I can accept that with a queue of people waiting, the staff are anxious to find a table, to have everything cleared away before you gave had chance to swallow the last mouthful is taking things to the extreme. There is a very comprehensive menu so it's not too difficult finding something you hope you will like although we did feel pressurized into deciding. The food arrives quickly and was quite tasty but it's certainly not a place where you can relax and take your time. Prices are about average for a restaurant in a shopping mall and if such delights as braised frog or pigs giblet congee are your sort of thing then you will probably enjoy the experience.We didn't mind sharing a table but we do not like being almost force fed! To be honest I thought the staff rude and unprofessional. Would we eat here again on one of our visits to Singapore ..... No
4
We have been going to this restaurant (and, later, several of its sister outlets - like Super Peking Duck Paragon and Asia Square, Shanghai, etc) since it first opened over ten years ago. In addition to Teochew dishes, they also serve the standard Cantonese favs, Consistent, reliably very good food. Great service by a loyal, low-turnover staff, who REMEMBER old customers like us by name, but treat all patrons with the same courtesy and efficiency. Over the years, we regret the disappearance of the delectable roasted goose. Some unusual dishes - like the 'yin-yang', or tomato and cream sauce fried rice, which one member of our family adores but other abhor
4
When Imperial Treasure first split from Crystal Jade around 10 years ago, I wondered whether it could survive as pretty much everything, from the menu down to the interior deco and logo and employee uniform is quite similar. Today, as Crystal Jade slowly dies from a self inflicted wound, I am glad Imperial Treasure is still around as an alternative for customers looking for authentic Cantonese food at relatively affordable price
4
I went to this restaurant with a pinch of salt thinking to myself 'just another expensive restaurant' but I came out happy and tucked. The lotus rice is really good with the right amount of ingredient and not too salty. The dumpling soup is so tasty i want to go backFor more!! Love it. Classy and good food for family or friend
5
This is always my to-go place when my family is craving for chinese food. I absolutely love the quality of the good as well as the service here. My family's favorite dishes are the teochew style steamed fish which is absolutely spectacular and the yam dessert is a must-get
5
this place is always packed. You can share tabless and everyone there inluding guests are all very friendly. The food is outstanding but the restaurant is so popular that they run out of some popular menu items very quickly. so get there for lunch rather than evening. but whatever you choose you can be assured of very good food
3
Food is ok. Service is horrible unless you are one of their Big clients. Price and quality of food does not gel.Very crowded on weekends and unless you are one of their big clients..... You have special treatment.Not recommended for tourist
4
There is always a lingering concern when the restaurant opens too many outlet and the overall quality of food, ambience and customer service will be affected. We were pleasantly surprise that this wasn't the case at the restaurant! The staff were sincere and attentive and they will suggest the appropriate portion for every order so that we don't waste food. And save money too! Kudo
4
Having avoided eating any meals at Ngee Ann City for years, we decided to have lunch here on a whim some months back. We thought the food was great and have been back several times since - tasty and not MSG laden like in some other chain restaurants. Apart from the dim sum, we would also recommend the teochew rice porridge and the bitter ground omelette- fast becoming our favourite dishes. Reservations are essential though the ladies at the front of house have very kindly squeezed us in at the last minute on a few occasions. The quid pro quo is that you don't linger after your meal. The main dining room is comfortable and well lit as are the large private dining rooms. There is also booth seating available which is cosier but not as well lit.
3
- Recommended for their noodle with roast duck. - The roast pork is also tasty but quite expensive. - The BBQ pork is not recommended
4
There was not queue when I visited this restaurant. The food was not bad but a bit pricy. Service quality was good. Will come and visit again and highly recommended ✌️
4
We went here for a quick 'Dim Sum' lunch only on a brief stopver in Singapore. The selection of Dim Sum was probably the widest we have ever seen & the quality of the both the cooking & ingredients was excellent. Service was quick but not partiualry good & we had at least one dish delivered incorrectly & had to wait quite a while for the correct one. Can't comment on the rest of the food/menu but excellent Dim Sum
4
Dim sum, roasted meat and certain dishes are nice here, but not all dishes were good. I prefer their Roast Pork & Duck, and ordered 滑蛋牛肉河粉， beef hor fun to go with it. Everything was delicious. They charge 80 cents for glass of water FY

This restaurant has the best barbecue pork with honey sauce. Went there 2 times in last 2 months and always no more BBQ pork with honey sauce. Disappointment. The restaurant should prepare more

Got to take long Q...... but if u dont mind to share table will be fast. Best meat congee and luohan tea.

If you enjoy Chinese food and need something for all your differing ages of family members this is the place. The food was great and we found something suitable in flavour and spice for all the family. Be careful with the soup it is super hot! But tastes great!

A friend recommended this place to me for lunch, so we met here. We were seated promptly, and although the food was served quickly, I was not impressed as much with the variety of food or quality - it seemed similar to other Chinese restaurants I have been to, and nothing stood out. And yet it was quite expensive for a lunch. Food was satisfactory, service was good, but nothing memorable to shout home about. I would not choose to come here, unless other people wanted to come here

Food here is great but service is mediocre . Disappointed with the dessert Ginger 汤圆.2 tiny 汤圆 cost $6!! Claimed to be fabulous, yummy and made in house!Has given feedback to supervisor / Manager. Hope to see improvements upon next visit. At least 3-4 balls for $6 is reasonable or have it in bigger size if it is only 2. This is Imperial Treasure Noodles & Congee house at 100AM

Good variety of Dim Sum, local and other Asian dishes, large menu. There's almost always a wait at lunch time, but it goes quickly and is well worth it. Often for smaller groups, they'll ask you if you're willing to share a table - definitely do it if you can, they are the big round tables and it's no big deal at all! Easy way to skip forward in the wait

This is our all time favorite dim sum place. Their char siu bao is a must and finish with egg custard or crispy red bean pastry with sesame. The waitresses here are lovely and attentive. If you work in Orchard come for lunch and try their excellent congee and noodle. We much prefer here to their more upscale sister restaurant Imperial Treasure Shanghai Cuisine

We have eaten at this restaurant 1-2 times per month for the last 4 years and enjoy its Dim Sum, BBQ pork, beef noodles and congee better than other restaurants. Good value for money, and the number of local Singaporeans eating here is testament to its quality. Expect a 45-60 minute wait on weekends, or go to the Raffles City branch for a shorter wait.

My wife and I had wanted to try this much-spoken-about congee restaurant but there always seems to be a long line waiting to be seated whenever we go there. We happened to be shopping at ION Orchard over the New Year long weekend and decided to try our chances. Surprisingly, the wait to be seated was only 20 minutes. Service was quick and efficient. The congee and dishes were as good as we expected. And the pricing was quite reasonable for ION standards. We expect to be returning quite frequently

me and my friends had a dinner on 22/12/2015 at this restaurant.At that day should be a very happy day as festival. however, the manager handled the issue make us so disappointed and spoil our day. we ordered one dish 猪颈肉 that is very huge and taste bad. we never eat this kind of 猪颈肉 before. we asked the waiter if possible we can change to another dish. the manager rejected to change for us as the dish is like that. the way she responded, its as if we do not exist.At the end, me and my friends never touched 猪颈肉。the manager should check our satisfaction in service line. its not like just ignore us. this is no the first time we are there as we like the service and quality of food before. and further more the price quite expensive, but we are willing to pay as we like it. Im really very very disappointed.I would not go back and recommend to my friends again

We visited this restaurant half a dozen times during an extended stay in Singapore. The congee, noodles and bbq meat dishes were very good and excellent value. We never failed to be satisfied with what we ordered and servcie was always helpful
5
Had several items ordered during lunch here. Overall it was good. The service was excellent. The restaurant was packed, with a long queue of at least half an hour wait. Never wonder. Because the food here just makes you come back for more.

We stumbled across this HK eatery on the first day of our 4D stay in Singapore. I can't fault their food. Consistent and delicious. You must try their dim sim - radish cake. It's so amazing! We dined their twice and did takeaways twice - they don't charge the service fee (10%) if you do takeaways. Their roast duck and pork is aromatic and not fatty plus their roast pork cracking is super crispy. Portions for roast meat is tiny! So it seems uber pricey, but when it tastes as good as it did, we were happy to fork out the $$. I also tried their crispy seafood noodles which had two massive prawns - well cooked and that was the highlight of the dish. I couldn't finish the dish, not enough toppings and too much noddles. Flavour was excellent.Staff were too attentive at times, for some reason they like to check our order receipts each time they pass by our table even though most and at times, when all dishes we ordered had arrived? I don't get it. There was one incident where one of our dishes was still being prepared and we experienced a rude Mainland waitress who raised her voice at my dad because he corrected her for a mistake. Overall, 9/10 food. 8/10 service.I would definitely come back and do a proper yum Cha session

If you like delicacies like duck web, tongue or frog with clam sauce, then this is the restaurant for you. I believe this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore now in terms of food. Dim Sum only up to 5pm and the siew mai is great! The chicken and mushroom buns are very cute as they are in the shape and colour of a shitake mushroom. Japanese friends may enjoy it
4
Visited at about 4pm and there was no queue at all. Ordered plain congee with soya sauce chicken which was delicious but portion looking a little small. Also ordered beef brisket which came in a more generous portion. I've always enjoyed my meals at this restaurant and would recommend to try their custard buns if you visit for lunch.Be prepared to queue if visiting during lunch and dinner peaks especially on weekends

~My Wife & I went for a Saturday brunch at 11am and due to the National Day weekend, there weren't anyone queuing outside, we got a table in less than a minute. It was actually a booth seat right at the far corner of the restaurant Table 73~we penciled our dim sum and ordered a Congee & Fried Vermicelli which all arrived in 5 mins~Ha Kau YUMz, Rice Rolls (Shrimp & BBQ Pork) both YUMz, Deepfried Wanton in a bow with sweet oil is SUPERz, Fish Congee to add to my crushed Wanton skins and a sliced meat vermicelli with everything on, minus the curry power you see in overseas dishes :(This is absolutely the best place for Dim Sum in Singapor
5
This is our favourite dim sum restaurant in Singapore. Unfortunately reservations are not possible so if you get the timing wrong it can be quite a long wait due to the popularity of this restaurant. It can also get a little noisy as Singaporeans insist upon bringing their young kids out to eat especially at weekends!That aside the food is served efficiently and swiftly and always piping hot. In addition to the wide range of dim sum or dumpling dishes the congee and the beef horfun are excellent and extremely tasty. My wife and I eat at this restaurant at least twice a month and to date have never had an indifferent experience. Excellent value for money

~whenever my wife & I need a dim sum fix, here's where we go to get the best since the Prince Room at Selegie :)~you get a queue number, wait your turn to be called, order and get served easy :) this place serves fast as food should be cooked and eaten :)~there are 2 slips of dim sum menus you can pencil your order either Cantonese (less spicy) or Shanghai (spicy)This is the staples I'd order~Cantonese Har Kow (just like I remember them)~Fried Wonton these the folded ones with a sweet & sour spiced sauce that uniquely served only with this dish, not the mayo that you get with the pocked faced wonton skinned ones~rice noodles with prawn & another with char siew, served with the light sweet fish soya sauce is a light meal always prepared freshMy wife will order the 3 treasure congee and get 1 fish & 2 century eggs into it and we'd prolly be out in less than 30 mins, the most affordable weekend late breakfast eve

Been to Imperial Treasure Noodle and Congee at this Ion branch for a few times now. The congee is indeed excellent and standards are consistently high. I like to select the congee that allows you to select any 2 ingredients, favorites for me are pork liver and pork ball. They have also excellent Dim Sum for lunch, the different types of dumplings are all good. Carrot cake, both steam and fried are good too. Their crispy pork and roasted duck seems to be very popular too. You will need to wait easily for 30 mins to get in on a Saturday lunch time, you will be given a number. Dinner on weekdays are less crowded

My favourite Congee Haunt. The Liwan boat style is worth every cent as it contains fish, cuttlefish, crunchy peanuts, pork skin, fried dough, spreads of pork with julienned spring onions. With pepper and its piping hot flavorful congee it really warm your hungry soul. I further complement it with duck's tongue and deep fried but soft inside tofu both very well stewed to perfection dipped in vinegared garlic chilli sauce.The menu has various congee of your choice.Dim sum is also served here.Noodles and fried rice are also offered. A restful place for me and I would like to see improvement in their service as I notice I have to repeat my requests of extra ginger for my siow long pao or please top up my tea

We thoroughly enjoyed eating here. We over ordered in our excitement but loved the beans and pork, roast meats and the egg rolls (we had prawn, pork and duck). Delicious food, fast service and fair prices make it a great meal overall.
5
General great tasting food. Recommended: congee, liu sha bao, har gow, siu mai, egg tart, char siu sou. Roast duck wasn't tasty enough. Roast pork was good but not excellent. Did not try the noodle, so can't comment.

Located inside ION.
One of the food stop while shopping in ION. This restaurant served no frills HongKong cuisines. Popular items, as the name suggest, is noodles and congee. The more adventurous Europeans can try the frog congee.
Overall, good food, decent service.

Chose this restaurant dinner.We tried to order the steamed rice rolls with roasted duck, but they had run out of roasted duck. So, we tried to order steamed rice rolls with BBQ pork, but they had also run out of BBQ pork (this was at 8:30pm).Subsequently, after we had finished what we had ordered, we tried ordering more steamed rice rolls, but they had run out of steamed rice rolls altogether (this was at 9:10pm).For dinner, we ended up having steamed rice roll with four treasures (chicken, beef, sliced fish and shrimp), xiao long baos, shrimp wanton noodles, sliced beef congee, deep fried pig's intestine and carrot pastry.From the steamed rice rolls with four treasures, the chicken was bland, and lacked texture, shrimp was a bit bland and didn't feel very fresh (which was surprising because the shrimps with the wanton noodles were very fresh), fish was acceptable and beef was tasty. Xiao long baos were average. The shrimp wanton noodles was good, shrimps were very fresh, but the amount of noodles was fairly small in size. Sliced beef congee and carrot pastry were good. Deep fried pig's intestine was average.Verdict: It is not a fair comparison, but I would prefer to stick with the Imperial Treasure restaurant at Takashimaya (although I normally go there for lunch and would only have dim sum

We came in based on its imperial treasure and its hongkong cuisine billing. We had :1) Roast pork - came out cold and limpy...2) claypot rice - seriously cant compare to the claypot rice in hk...3)macau crispy pork bun was alright4).wanton noodles - overcooked Seriously, Imperial treasures billing fell flat. Dont insult hong kong cuisine...

My husband went back for a 2nd round after our 1st visit during our 4-day trip to Singapore. This time we tried the congee and noodles. They were excellent! I had the simple dry noodles with ginger and shallots (spring onion); noodles were al dente, springy as it should be and very tasty. The congee was fine and smooth like those found in Hong Kong.The other dishes we tried and enjoyed were the har gao, siew mai, custard buns and char siew pastries. We felt the roast duck was rather bland. Overall, I would highly recommend this place that has a simple setting like a cafe but serves excellent food. Queues are rather long but the wait isn't. Service was friendly too.

We had lunch last Sunday at this excellent noodle shop. Although table reservations are not possible we had only a short wait before being shown to our table. Whilst a little cramped and with minimal furnishings the location was clean and the staff helpful and friendly.We ordered six dishes all of which were served individually. The highlight of the meal was the crispy noodle with seafood but the wanton which we have had on previous occasions is equally good.What distinguishes this chain of restaurants from some of its competitors is the piping hot food. Every dish was served hot and remained so until finished. All in all excellent food, reasonably priced and attentive service

We really like the Dim Sum here. The har-gau and the steamed custard bun are really good. The roasted duck and roasted pork are also excellent. The xiao-long-pao is so so. But you have to be there early to get a seat. We were there 20 minutes after opening time and the restaurant was already fully seated and giving out queue numbers! This is a good place to introduce foreign friends to good Chinese food, at reasonable cost. The bill for five of us (all adults) came to about SGD130 including taxes

This is a review of the outlet in 100AM mall. I have been to several outlets under Imperial Treasure, but first time dining at 100AM mall. Went there on a weekday and thankfully we had made a reservation prior to hopping in for lunch. The restaurant was filled with office workers working around the Tanjong Pagar area. Given the crowd, it's a place where one can soak in the ambience of a dim sum restaurant but if one is there for serious business or negotiation, you will probably want to avoid it.Tables are set quite close to each other so your conversations (if confidential) can be easily heard by your neighbors.Despite the lunchtime crowd, service was still quite good and it's always good to see familiar faces...- I was happy to see one of the captains from Ion Orchard branch.The dim sum and food has never disappoint. The standard of imperial treasure seems to be more consistent across their different outlets compared to crystal jade. The only branch of Imperial treasure that I find lacking in service and quality will be the branch at 111 Somerset which serves food like a hongkong cafe (茶餐厅).As usual, loved the roast pork, which was roasted to perfection. Dim sum was tasty and delicate... Carrot cake was soft and turnip strips can be tasted as well. If you are around the area and would like a quick dim sum fix, just head down to imperial treasure and you won't be disappointed

We live in Singapore for almost 15 years. We love to eat Dim Sum at least once every month. Imperial Treasure Noodle & Congee restaurant so far is the best place to go, although the waiting to get table when lunch time is quite sometimes, but most of the meals that we had never fail, always good.Our favorite meals are chicken fried rice, pork belly, cuttle fish chili and pepper and the must try one is "custard bun" so so good. Remember this Custard bun they only serve until 05:00 PM. Meaning no custard bun on dinner. For all duck lover please also order their famous duck dish.I really recommend this restaurant to anybody who likes dim sum or any Chinese food. The restaurant is nice, bright and clean and most of the waitress are nice.
