Highly recommended,a great place to gather with family,friends & colleagues,good quality of variety dishes..with a fair price..Friendly staff & Good Ambiance to dine in

Great set lunch food menu which is good value for money when you are out for fine dining at bar bar cluny. But Menu keeps changing which makes me disappointed. Initially thai food was at Cluny. I really no idea why the kitchen is no more. Requesting to bring back thai kitchen we love tamarind prawns, fried wonton and tom yom soup. We used to go there your place often but now very seldom come for dining. Service always best at this place even though at times very busy during lunch or dinner time. We always appreciate the service team both manager and crew . Very pleasant moments at all times

We ate at bar bar black sheep and enjoyed the amazing dinner and drinks menu. All dishes were delicious. The food was really fresh and service was outstanding. We also felt value for money, and the quiet, elegant ambiance just added to our stunning dinner evening. Thank you bar bar. We Will Be Back
5
I'll highly recommend Bar Bar Black Sheep @ CLUNY COURT :)I love everything there; the cosy ambience, the excellent service from the staff and the food.I had the Deluxe Club Burger (yummy beef patty burger topped with saut√©ed mushroom, chesse, bacon plus a sunny side-up egg) and a special customised cocktail :) It was simply amazing, nicely prepared and a great value for the price
5
We were in Upper bukit Timah area and looking bring some out of town relatives for a good dinner..I m searching online this restaurant name sound quite funny bar bar black sheep..so we want to give a try.as it turned out , it was a proper restaurant with a nice cosy setting offering three different kitchen but only think is so many menu that make us more time so choose the dishes.food was not a bad price wise is decent charges... Services is really fast and they are really owasome staff... definitely will come back again.

Visited this joint on a Friday evening with my husband at 5:30pm and ordered a Korean soup dish. Asked the staff if there is already rice in the soup (like most Korean soup dishes), waiter replied no so I added a bowl of their Choo Choo rice, which is an expensive $2 price and tiny bowl. Not even the amount in a usual bowl.At least the soup had rice in the end so I returned my bowl of rice. Overall $15 for this dish with an odd side dish of western cold salad that didn't work with the hot dish. Amount was average as well. Taste is okay but will not order anything Korean here anymore.Husband ordered butter naan and curry and amount was much more sizeable and topped up my otherwise average meal

Nice place to visit at night, good atmosphere, however just a bitHidden from the botanic garden but excellent place for meet ups, gatherings & meetings. There are so many options for food & drinks at bar bar black sheep Cluny court. Service crew is very attentive and fast response to the drinks order. Its Really must appreciated of the service team & good to see that they keep moving all the tables and approaching. Sure will come back soon. Cheer
4
Come around evening to night is the best time to see the night outdoor atmosphere to drink & talk. Its really very cozy decent crowd to hang out. Reasonable price for drinks & food. Great & kind service to our table. Staff were super friendly. Enjoyed our evening
5
Food was excellent and the ambience is great! The services was good was well...üëçüëçüëç
Will do visit with friends and family again...
Good f&b skills.....
5
Ordered a western burger which was rather disappointing, however the excellent service at the restaurant more than made up for it!
5
I have heard from my friend must definitely visit once atleast. This place has a lovely indoor outlook & outdoor ambience. It has a nice open airy feeling. Got more variety of food but doesn't matter drinks options are phenomenal with moderate ranges of prices. The service was excellent n wonderful. The staff very attentive & manager is so kind/helpful all the time thru out our evening. Its a highly recommended bar & restaurant. One of the best place at bukit timah botanic garden. Cheer
5
I passby, Wanted something other than food, so googled and came up with this restaurant for mainly drinks.Very nice cozy environment for having beers & bar bar house cocktails.Our host santhosh was very informative......he told us about the receipe in each drinks. I was stunted that he remember my order & repeated to me without note it down.Overall a great place to chill out for everyone.Highly recommended place at A bit hidden gardens
5
It was our second time here and we were very well satisfied with our food.We ordered Indian food and drinks to chill.indian food at it's best.with big screen tv's and happy enough staff.in great location by the this place and certainly an easy place to enjoy.Can say Brooklyn IPA is the best out of all beers.we would be back here for sure
5
I had the salmon main course and cider. Dish is flavourful but a tad bit too salty to my liking. But delicious overall. Good size portion. Value for money. Staff are casually friendly. Place is cosy and not too crowded/squeezy with tables. Music is of good volume where you can still hear each other talking. Area is clean and neat as well. Convenient to go to from MRT (Botanic Gardens) but a bit tricky for some to find as entry is on the side of the building
5
Was delightfully surprised with this place & environment.Excellent meal with many many variety of dishes with 3 different kitchen. Brilliant service by the staff & their team. I guess there is a event happening at this restaurant but the manager come forward & provide me the better table with warm welcome eventhough he is very busy with the event. They really went out of there way to make me and my partner feel welcome and special...Will return when next in Singapore

‚ÄúBar Bar Black Sheep Restaurant‚Äù, is the third restaurant we have been visited in our journey in Singapore. My wife and my children love the foods they have. They are good not only for the foods their services also very nice. I like the way they handle their customers. If I come again to Singapore firstly I will visit the ‚ÄúBar Bar Blackship‚Äù
5
Am one of the regular customers at bar bar black sheep but today very very terrible indian food. I ordered lemon rice & naan. One of the worst tasteless dishe prepared by chef. Either change chef or improve the quality of indian food. We always come here to eat Indian food but this time really disappointed. I really need to mention about service.. Service team doing a great job Always. Keep it up guy
4
Am friquent customer of bar bar cluny.Asically i like indian dishes.but the option forindian vegetarian starter are less.specially during week days theres no kebab.Watever i order , either the dish not availableor the chef on leave.But must appreciate the staff there.They try toconvince me byrecommending other dishes.Can increase the indian veg starters or bring back indian samosa.I will definetily come back forcluny hard working service team
5
Been on a Friday night, atmosphere was chill and easy. Many varieties of food but Western food price is quite expensive & taste-wise can be improved. Service was quick & friendly‚ò∫
4
Me and my husband went this place for the first time.good place for couple and family..we ordered 'butter chicken'.Butter chicken is not hot but the taste is not bad.The service was fantastic.manager and all staff very friendly.confirm will come back again.
5
First time here and definately would visit again!!! The food is delicious and worth it, staff is friendly and overall a great experience :) 10/10

It all comes back to the basics.serve customers the bests tasting food at a good value in this restaurant.cleaner comfortable this place.their prices also very reasonable.their staff is very good and friendly.Sure we Will coming back again "Bar Bar Black Sheep".
5
As I have tried so many restaurants in Singapore, I found its unique, Bar Bar Black Sheep Korean chicken dish. Its very fresh & tasty. It was really awesome meal especially with their warm hospitality & amazing service by bar bar staff . I would like to introduce this place to my friends & it makes me to have regular meals in this shop with affordable prices.
5
Nice place for me to chill on a sunday night. Away from the busy hustle of life in the city. Nice warm lights creating a warm cozy ambience with music that is not overly loud. Service staffs are very attentive as well. Food waiting time was quite fast. Manager is nice and ensures I enjoyed my drinks but food is just ok. Ordered crabmeat pasta and the crabmeat given was a little bit too much in ratio with the pasta, I could not finish all of it. Did not expect the gravy to have chilli included too, although not very spicy but would prefer it with no chilli padis or maybe even without and I can just add my own serving of tobasco in it. Enjoyed the Bar bar black sheep drink though, has a tinge of sweetness every sip, the flavour of the blended taste is just nice. Ever since I found this place, I will drop by here more often whenever I can and suggest this place to my friends as well
5
The staff was very welcoming when we entered in to the restaurant and the way they explain the menus was really good and there were different kinds of food and drinks. from the food items the pizza seafood was the one inspired me. From the drinks red wine was fabulous. I really hope to come back again
4
As i came to singapore this monday, i was finding an indian restaurant to have my dinner. So as i walking through the street i found this restaurant and when i entered into the restaurant there was a great welcome for me by the service staff. And as i am new to the restaurant one of the service staff member explained me about the 3 menus. And i ordered the indian food , they servied me it very quickly and the food is soo nice and the service is perfect.And the drink that was servied to me is so nice.Definitely i will come back
5
Bar bar black sheep is the best sheep in the flock and certainly worth at-tending. Santhosh and staff-extremely attentive and gracious to boot. The food is good and the drinks list is nothing if not impressive. A right little gem in the unique enclave of Cluny Road.Lou
5
This place have a natural and very beautiful environment. Clean as well now and nice lighting on the outside sitting area. Manager and staff was very friendly. The food exceptionally tasty and flavored. Food and beer make a good match. Definitely will be back anytime soon. GREAT...
5
I usually dont really enjoy indian food but when i ate the naan with butter chicken, i was very impressed with it. Both the taste and presentation! And i was amazed on the appearance of the restaurant both outdoor and indoor. Awesome!
5
Very beautiful environment '' bar bar black sheep ''.The staff here are awesome and friendly. Wonderful service provided by the superb friendly staff. Foods and drinks are affordable price. Highlight is No gst No service. Definitely I will come to this place.
1
Nice food, but rude waiting staff. I had to get the menu myself and they were so rude when ordering. They were also too busy on their mobile phones to pay any attention to customers. Pity.
5
Last month I have been visited to Singapore and suddenly I found the good restaurant called "Bar Bar Black Sheep". I'm really happy to eat from there because I feel like I was in home. The Indian food in there is very tasty. Also their service is better than the other restaurants I visited. So, from my experience I would like to recommend it to you all who is going to visit in Singapore.
4
There was nothing that stood out about the food at this place but still I had western food not up to mark. Indian food available but no platter that's very disappointed. Concepts is still nice with 3 different kitchen, chefs can be trained well. To be honest service is amazing & the drink is very quick to my table. That's really made my day worth at this place. Good to see the manager is very attentive & moves around all the tables that's one thing I want to appreciate. Definitely I will come back for sure
5
I was walking around botanic gardens and thats when i found my new favourite hide out. Bar Bar Black Sheep is going to be my new place to chill especially with its super cheap food. But the best thing here,besides the food is really the service. Despite the fact that theres no gst or service charge,the staff here are really hardworking and friendly. Theyre able to serve very fast and efficently and overall,theyre really customer minded. I must say that of all the places ive eaten,i find that the staff here really do love their jobs and are willing to make sure that we have a great time. the manager did a great job on training all the staff. gonna come back here soon with my famil
5
I was walking around and i found this hidden gem. The place has 3 menus and a wide varriety of food that i was spoilt for choices. Luckily the manager Santhosh came and gave me recommendations. Not only that,its value for money with the happy hour prices. Its really cheap and the cheapest bar by far. I highly recommed everyone to give this place a try as there is something here for everyone. Definetely gonna come back here again
5
Visited on a Tuesday night with my friend and we had a great experience there. I ordered an aglio olio and my friend had a seafood pasta. We also ordered the cheese fries. The food and drinks were delicious and affordable. The service was really fast and the staff was exceptional in making us feel really at home, being friendly and attentive. The setting is comfortable, with outdoor and indoor sections. We had such a great time we didn't even realise we had almost stayed till closing time. Kudos to the great team at BBBS. Highly recommended
3
we go almost every other week. Recently they changed the menu and some of the staffs seems to have changed as well. Menu used to be much better, more variety. Food quality also went down compared to before. Not sure if the chef has changed as well. Service was also much better before. Went there yesterday and service was slow and food was not as good as it used to be. Decided to skip this place from now on
5
I'm back with friends after a year later at cluny bar bar..normally i will visit Holland bar bar since im closed by at cluny i give it a try here...and I have seen a lot of good changes. clean as well now and nice lighting on the outside sitting area. Indian food have improved since then..service's by manager santhosh and staff was top notch.. definitely will be back anytime soon.. great job guy's
4
A very pleasant bar restaurant, just a short walk across the bridge from the Gand Copthorne if you are looking for something less stuffy. The food list as wide and the beer is cold.
5
The perfect place to wind your day with great chilled beers and some delicious nibbles. The fact that they sell craft beers was a pleasant surprise! The nibbles are a delight too.
5
The place is hidden but a great hangout spot after work! Most surprised that they have Green devil IPAs! Friendly staff and amazing food combos... must visit!
5
Went there with an office colleague for lunch on Friday. We enjoyed our meal. The food was exceptionally tasty and flavored. We ordered chicken kebabs, butter chicken and fish masala.... one of the best Indian food In Singapore.
5
Went here for the 2nd time and been to another outlet as well..This place is amazing hidden infront of botanical garden mrt..Drinks was affordable for this area.. what is amazing is that this place have a unique concept offering variety of drinks and different menus as well..Service was fast for no GST and no service charge..keep it up guys..definitely coming back..
5
Came back to Bar Bar Black Sheep Cluny Court yesterday and was pleasantly surprised that the entire outlet has been touched up, and looks alot better than before. Great cold Brooklyn craft beer on tap now, and had an amazing Indian set dinner from their North Indian stall (Ali Bar Bar). Was also told that they have a popular Korean Fried Chicken stall opening there next week as well, can't wait to try that out! Should be great with beer
1
I've never bothered to write a review but my experience at this outlet baffled me. The service staff was really rude when we were trying to order and when I asked to check on my wine, I was talked back to. I believe he was the manager and he was very annoyed at us even when we tried to tell him the steak my friend ordered (she wanted M) but it came our MR and bloody. He began to dispute that that was definitely M but we all could see that it wasn't. I worked in a restaurant selling quality wagyu steaks and prime ribs for the last 2 and a half years and I most certainly knew what that doneness was. He gave it back to the kitchen and it came back to my friend well done... an absolute nightmare. Furthermore, the salmon my friends had were TINY. Picture attached to prove it. Most certainly wasn't worth the price they paid (~$24). The squid ink pasta I had was outrageously salty and pasta was overcooked. The plan was to stay for the affordable drinks but after the service and food we received, we had to get out of there. Boycotting the brand from then
5
Impressed by the ambience and wonderful service provided by the superb friendly staff on my first visit to this outlet with my friends. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been to the other outlet in Holland Village and the service in Cluny is far superior than in HV. Food is AMAZING and the foreign beers make a good match. 10/10 would recommend would definitely come back for another pint of Blanc and some hearty Butter Chicken
2
Although no service charge is included, there should be some level of service as one still has the opportunity to tip. Given that the restaurant was not busy we could not understand why the food took so long. Further to that some special requests were made and the food arrived without these been heeded. After we raised this a second burger arrived still not correct so we gave up. We requested sauces it never arrived.Halfway through our meal the music was turned off and a football match on TV was broadcast at high volume. The Thai menu no longer exists so it needs to be updated on Chope and other websites.Needless to say we will not be back
5
The staff here are awesome and friendly. Food and drinks are also cheap and good because there's no GST and service charge. Must try sides like buffalo wings and mozeralla cheese sticks for side dishes! Also quiet and nice place, good for chilling with the bros or conversation with friend
5
Came across this place after walking around Botanical Gardens, and what a hidden gem! We had butter chicken, palek paneer and biryani, they were all lovely. Prices of their wines are very reasonable, we had their very own sheep shape sauvignon blanc and it really paired well with the food that we had ordered. Would definitely come back again
4
Extremely tasty Indian food and French Rose that completes the weekend. Go for the garlic-cheese naan and chicken tikka masala if you are having their French Rose on promo. Never disappoints! Had the carbonara too but it's really forgettable. For bar grub, opt for fried mozzarella cheese sticks and white bait. Perfect with beer.We didn't have desserts as they only had ice-cream that night so we walked over to Dao Paolo ;)Just one complain about BBBS @ Cluny Courtyard, they need to replace their tables!!
1
We ordered few dishes and nothing was good, starting from some Indian food (chicken tikka) to other food like nachos and beef burgers. Absolutely a waste of money. Staff was also rude and the music in the background was repeting all the time. For sure the worst place I have been in my 7 years in Singapore
2
The staff were very rude when handling orders and serving the food . The food was rather disappointing.The fish batter was very doughy for the fish and chips,the calamari was overcooked and the batter was so thick and oily it was very badly don .Was told off extremely rudely about my water bottle,I understand where he was coming from but the tone that he said it in was really uncalled for.Had super high expectations of this place what a let down
4
So the not so great part first, which isn't so bad- you are next to a busy main road, so no scenery. But that's Singapore in areas like this! Secondly, alcohol prices in Singapore is insane, but that's everywhere! We frequent this bar because you can sit outside, relax, great staff and amazing curry! Order it behind the bar at the restaurant and they will bring it to you. It's really good. Definitely recommend this place because of that!
2
Ordered Indian and Thai food. Basil chicken and butter chicken were very salty. Otahotah & Tom yum soup were decent. Staffs were not exactly very friendly
3
Went there during dinner around 7pm and only a few tables is occupied. Asked for the menu and just pointed at the bar area, which i need took it myself. Food was average and probably there was no service charge so everything you have to do it yourself including went to the counter to ask for the bill
2
I went to Bar Bar Black Sheep Cluny Court after a very long time and was extremely disappointed to see that the place had taken a turn for the worse. I had gone to order some takeaway from the Indian outlet. The first observation was the attitude of the staff behind the counter was less than acceptable. No greeting, no hello, no smile, just standing there. I placed my order to which he responded in mono syllables. It was like he was doing me a favour by taking my order. Made me feel quite unwelcome.The dishes themselves were nothing like what they used to be 2 years aho. The yellow dhal was tasteless and bland and lacked any type of flavour. The mutton roganjosh cost $12 but was not any better than the mutton you would get in a local hawker south indian stall for $3.The whole experience was disappointing and a waste of money and effort. I would like this place to get back to what it was 2 years ago
3
Visited BBBS during dinner , our first visit to this hidden hideout at Cluny Court. Very casual chill ambience with music offering various types of beers , spirits, Thai , Indian and western cuisine . Tried the crab meat spaghetti and Indian veggie dish, they were alright , average tasting. This place is good for beer ,sports entertainment and group gatherings. There's no Gst and service charge but there were mosquitoes in the outdoor area , so be prepared if you are wearing shorts.
3
Went on a weekday for lunch and service could be much improved!! would recommend the Indian set menu; Super value for $$!!
5
Environment was pretty good.. one of the best restaurant-bar I ever went.. Price of the food was reasonably
2
While we were familiar with the old Bar Bar Black Sheep outlet at Cherry Avenue further down Bukit Timah Road, we decided to check the Cluny Court location for the first time, since we were craving for some North Indian grub like we used to get at Cherry Avenue.Made a reservation at 12noon as allowed on the system, and we got there 10mins before. Strangely enough...the shutters were closed, complete with food that hadn't been cleared up from the night before, left on the tables located al fresco. No matter. The family decided to head for Cold Storage to escape the heat and come back at 12 sharp, which we did.Upon our return, we were delighted to find the shutters open, and we seated ourselves inside the restaurant (standard fare for BBBS because it's pretty much self service). We thought that the restaurant would cool off since they just opened, but the place was basically stifling from start to finish. The fans and poorly maintained air-conditioning didn't help matters.To make things worse, we were told that while the restaurant opens at 12pm, the kitchen isn't operational till 12.30pm. No big deal if it's just adults, but we had 2 hungry toddlers that were expecting to get fed asap. It's a good thing my kids are trained to be patient, but it didn't make sense for the restaurant to open for business without a prepped kitchen don't you think?I'm afraid the stuffy ambience, the horrid single tune on repeat, and the ridiculously dim lighting didn't make our first visit a pleasant one. The North Indian food and mac and cheese we ordered were decent, albeit quite bloody small in terms of portion size. $63, for 2 bryanis, 2 nan breads, 1 butter chicken, 1 mac and cheese, and 2 iced teas. Not exactly value for money considering the mac and cheese was just enough for the 4 year old kid, and the Butter Chicken had about 4 small pieces of meat swimming in a lagoon of gravy. The Indian establishment at Cherry Avenue was miles ahead I'm afraid.I find myself hard pressed for a second visit in future.P.S The lighting was far too low to provide any useable photographs of the food...not that it really matters anyway
4
If you'd like to unwind at a secluded restaurant, head to Bar Bar Black Sheep at Cluny Courtyard. There's a MRT station right at the door-step so it's very convenient. Food wise, it is delectable and reasonably priced. There's a good selection of alcohol as well.
4
Visited here with a friend after a lovely but long and v hot walk through the Botanical Gardens. It's tucked away down a side path and we just decided to risk it and see what was down there, v pleasantly surprised as it has a nice comfortable outdoor area with fans and a very nice setup inside. Ordered the steak Bruschetta and fries which was really nice and some lovely cold Blonde beers.Staff were friendly and efficient. Highly recommended.
3
Mushroom Aglio Olio was spicy enough for me; good kick, not too oily, sufficient mushroom slices √¢≈ì≈íMac & Cheese is an apparently an appetiser, but it is so rich that it could do as a main of its own. Best for sharing though. Nicely done.WiFi password only given to those who order drinks >$10 or something. Don't know why there is this policy because we are still paying customers despite not drinking, but it is what it is. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats WiFi available - only if you order >$10 drin
4
Finally completed my visitation of their chain shop. Comparing all 4 outlets, this is the most hidden from view, but most idyllic. A pathway leading to a beer garden restaurant, it is almost invisible from the main road. Food wise, the Indian variety is comparable to the other outlets, but my preference is still the original beside Elm Ave
2
It should have been a really pleasant garden cafe-restaurant-winebar. Instead, they play really loud dance music. Loud noisy obnoxious dance music. The music was totally clashing with the restaurant atmosphere. When I asked the waiter if he could turn the music volume lower, he said that they could not and that the music settings and music selections were predetermined. This was even stranger. The place wasn't that busy, and if one of the tables is asking for the music to be turned lower, of course they should turn the music lower. Was shocked.We then moved from the obnoxiously loud indoor to the still loud outdoor. Unfortunately, they also allow smoking outside, and we frequently smelled the smoke coming over from the smoker section.The place has really good potential. It would be a wonderful place to come after a stroll through Botanic Garden. The food is good and the restaurant setting has a lot of potential.Just terrible restaurant management
3
3 different cuisines, good for groups up till 8. Recommend making reservation in advance for dinner, but for lunch it's quieter.Pizza was baked well and had a crispy texture ($10.90 for 4 pieces).Caesar Salad ($8.90) was worth the price for one portion.No free water tho, one bottle is $2.90
3
Came here for dinner with my wife. Ordered the steak and blue cheese burger.No steak knives supplied so made it difficult to eat. Burger was the wrong order... But they added the blue cheese on the side later. Food was ok...nothing more I can write about it. Friendly staff, but don't expect silver service.
5
Service was prompt and food was good and reasonably priced (No GST and no service charge!). The ambience was cosy and romantic indoors but yet suitable for groups of friends as well. Just ONE gripe we had - their in-house Bar Bar Sheep ale is not good (we have tasted better
3
The food here is ok - not the best in town but if you are in the area or want to order from uber eats some Indian food then it's ok. The garlic naan is good
4
Great range of (pricey) but top street food. The Thai meals were delicious. Service was awful however
3
Have make reservation under Chope. but they not prepared the table for us. Inddor air-conditioning not sure is not function well or no swtich on at all. We all sweating while having our meal for one hour plus. We did order grilled chicken chop and squid ink spaghetti, both of these dishes are quite salty. Not really suit for us. Friends order phad thai, tom yum and nasi lemak. Phad Thai waitied for long and we need to remind the waiter.
2
Good for drinks n sports u think. Waiter recommended the Thai set meal, turned out to be so so based on a bar/restaurant standard. Will not go back.
3
Laid back and tucked away behind Cluny Court, it's a getaway if you like 'Al Fresco' dining. (Air conditioning present but not switched on, fans were whirling and this was in the indoor section.They have an ambitious menu. Indian, Western, Thai. Definitely not horrible but neither was it great.You can get a lunch set for under $11 excluding drinks.I'm not a drinking person. Think those who enjoy a drink with a large selection of tucker will appreciate this place more
4
Paying a second visit and it never fail me. Standard maintained. I have a primary school friends gathering and all are happy with the food, wine and service. They are definitely coming back for more. Keep up the good work. Cheers. Eric Leong.
2
The foods are okay but serving portion and presentations not up the the price been paid for. But a great variety of food choices I must say. From Indian to Thai and western.
1
Second time here, first time shut the bar at half time of the football so left. Gave it another try, great setting and location but service is woeful. Kitchen closed at 9pm on a Sunday! Staff were only interested in closing and going home. Won't come back and suggest owners if interested in running a successful business look at staff and opening hours.
2
We had a seat at the outdoors section away from the smoking corner however we had to change our seats because it was too hot. Ironically, the other side of the outdoors section where the smoking corner is was much cooler because there was extra fans and all. The food tasted ok but our buffalo wings that were supposed to arrive in 5 minutes never appeared. We had to cancel the order. The place seemed understaff. Service was quite ba

I have been going there for a few years and just found out about change of ownership taking place. The beers are still fine but the food at the Indian station has completely changed for the worst. Portions are much smaller, there is a lot of sauce for very little meat, prices are therefore now very high for what you get. It is more canteen like, which is a real shame as previous owner was very sociable and was obviously caring about what was going into his customers' mouths. Papadoms no longer complimentary and are 2 dollars for substandard ones. Very very very disappointed, the crowds at the Chinese eateries next door will only continue to see growing queues to get in as a result, leaving empty tables at this once overcrowded bar. Or simply stop serving food and focus on the drinks....
5
I was at this place last week and decided to say just a few things...
1. Hospitality - Excellent
2. Food - Great
3. Ambience - Nice
4. Service - Good
5. Drinks - Superb
4
Dropped in with friends for a beer. The atmosphere was good and the beer was fine and no more expensive than anywhere else in Singapore
5
This is my second to coming to the restaurant. The service was good able to serve us on time however it was busy. The food was delicious especially butter chicken. Definitely will come back again.
The price is reasonable..
3
Comfy place, with nice music.
Staffs were attentive and their food not bad. We ordered the ribeye steak, Mac & cheese and Belgium waffles with chocolate ice cream. üëçüëç
Worth to go!
4
Nice pub like feel. Good music and ambience. I have eaten from the Indian menu twice now. Dall Makhani is great. The Haryali kebab and fish kebab is the most tender and juicy I have eaten for a while. Great food and fun place.
4
A group of fun cheeky runners having our Carbo Loading in this restaurant and we are having tons of enjoyment that evening. Nice environment, friendly staff, tasty food and variety of drinks. What more to ask for. We'll definitely come back for more. Cheers.
4
We went there last Sunday. We had a nice meal, and I would definitively label it as a Sports Bar with a very nice menu. The staff is very friendly, and there are plenty of options to eat and drink. I believe you can even organize a gathering/party with a couple of friends. There is a dart chart, which you can play

Went to this so called popular restaurant from words of mouth and have pretty high expectation....left a very disappointed man and friends...Firstly, the infrastructure is very very worn down, the state of the outdoor sitting roof is so dirty and worn out... using canvas to act as an additional layer but water still dripping from it as it was raining then, can see algae formation on the roof and canvas material, the seat cushion look dirty and super soft, end up sitting almost with my neck nearing the table top or maybe i am just heavy....As it was raining so chose to sit indoor, wrong decision as inside was so stuffy and humid, ceiling fans does not serve the purpose at all, no air con either...Secondly, the services is very bad, the waiter that served us seem no mood and was talking to himself when we order our meal, a slight smile will change everything. Ordered at 1215hrs, food came at almost 1pm! a long 45 mins of wait! and in between no apologies or even at least when we ordered could have told us the kitchen is not ready yet (that is what i observed that caused the delay of the food) and might expect to delay. The food ordered was simple dishes and not like some elaborated dishes that required long preparation time! there were probably 3 groups of diners at that time.....Finally when the dishes were served, we noticed that the group sitting outside who came in much later than us got served first! And the food we saw walking past us are what we ordered too! btw there isnt much choices on the menu at least during lunch. Is it because we were local and they wasn't? When we try to polite and pass a simple remarks that the dishes were served late to the waiter that walked past us, all we got is a simple "ha" and that it! no follow up, nothing....I wont elaborate much on the food which i felt is nothing fantastic and can get similar food at any coffee shop nearby at a faction of the price...definitely will not return...

Bar Bar Black Sheep is a wonderful restaurant that calls itself a bar.The place is so nice and the north indian food are awesome . They hav a great selection of draught beers, wines , great bar bar black sheep and a blue sheep cocktails. Also Homemade Lassi.. Service staff is friendly thought not polished .but, hey , this is a bar after all.NO GST NO SERVICE CHARGE ....

This was our second visit with our family of 2 adults and 2 kids (6 & 9). Bar Bar Black sheep is tucked away down a laneway in Cluny Court just off Bukit Timah Rd. The cuisine is a mixture of Indian and Thai food but when we went this time they had added a selection of tapas meals which we tried and enjoyed. On a Saturday night this place was really busy with a mixture of people there just to drink the selection of draught beers and cocktails and those who wanted to eat. The service was efficient (not necessarily friendly, but did the job).They have English Premier League playing on 2 televisions which initially made me wonder if this place was more bar than restaurant however we were pleasantly surprised by the food. Our kids love the Butter chicken there and we had a 4 of the tapas offferings. The tapas is more like small tasting plates of the actual menu rather than the tapas you might find in an authentic Spanish place. Overall, this is a good go-to restaurant when we want something relatively quick and not too expensive and we haven't thought to book ahead

Food is great..Ambience is relaxing and cool..Fast service..Rayhaan is good and relax in explaining every type of liquer and beer..Affordable and confirm will come back again..

Great spot for a quick bite and a few beers. They do good beer on tap, with some Indian and Thai food. I liked their fish tikka and butter chicken with Naan.
3
Food- Lot of choices to choose from, Good bottled beer collection, Slow Service
Ambience- Decent ambience for family outing and hangouts
Price- Bit over priced for quality of food
3
It's a convenient location and has outdoor seating. Food is fairly standard fast food bar style with Indian, Thai and western offerings. What we found very disconcerting was their refusal to serve tap water and insisting that we bought bottled water instead. That put quite a few of the more environmentally aware in the party's backs up. While we can understand their stance from a profitability point of view if people were just "hanging out", everyone was having a full meal and other (alcoholic) beverages

A friend had recommended this place some time back. Then I stumbled upon a review in Ladyironchef website. It had glowing review for the Cluny Courtyard restaurant. So me and a friend ended up at this restaurant, with our respective spouses. What happened next was so bad that it became really amusing later.We reached about 8pm or so and were allocated a table near the entrance - our backs to the kitchen counter from where food was being served and a door on our right hand side where dirty dishes are accumulated before being washed (door was left open often!). Other end of the restaurant seemed lot better.We ordered some appetizers, including "samosa". We clarified with the staff that samosa on the menu is Indian samosa or local triangular potato-filled savouries that are labelled as samosa. Since the staff advised it is "the samosa", we went for it only to regret later. Then we ordered 2 cocktails for the ladies and a "bucket" of beer. That's when fun started.Staff brought the cocktails and ladies did not like the look or taste of it. Immediately after, the beer "bucket" was served - staff brought 4 beer bottles with the caps opened. We were somewhat amused and hailed the staff back. We asked why would they open all the 4 bottles when only 2 of us are having beers (ladies have their cocktails) - it would go stale. Also since we ordered a bucket, can they not put the other 2 bottles in the "bucket" with ice to keep it chilled....this is typically how it is served at other places. By the time we finished our sentences the staff went batshit crazy on us. Agitated, he said "you did not ask me to open the first 2 bottles either but I did...that's how we serve...I opened all the 4 bottles to help you...yada yada". My friend interjected and asked about the bucket with ice and then the staff started raging "you want bucket, I will give you bucket...is that what you want, I will give you bucket".When he went away to fetch the "bucket", we burst out laughing. What is a night out without stories to tell.I believe the manager may have noted the interaction at out table and we were served by someone else for rest of the evening.Later we were served food - naans, chicken etc. Without being prejudiced by the incident above, I would say the food was mediocre. One can get better food for lesser price at Lau Pa Sat or Maxwell. I typically do not waste food but its one of the few rare occasions I had to give up.Eventually we left the place with a chuckle - food was crap but we had our fun story to share with friends. We ended up at another dessert place after that

We had read reviews about poor or slow service, but these criticisms were not borne out in our experience.The bar employs chefs of different ethnicities (Indian, Thai and Malay/Singaporean) to produce three distinct menus with just enough variety. There was a wide range of drinks available and the prices were reasonable
4
It's a solid step up from a hawker stall, but features a number of different cuisines under one roof. One of the nicer outlets by the Bar Bar crew, it features a small area indoor, as well as a nice outdoor seated area. The food features Indian, Pizza and other Western fare, and is well priced
4
this is my first time dinner at barbar black sheep with some few friend I find the place so romantic with the candle on the table and the dim light ...very peace to have dinner and enjoy food there. . the food is nice all my friend are happy with food and the drink ...for sure will return there next time for lunch ....the service very friendly and warm with smile specialy Mr gurinderjit has a fabulous smile keep it updefinitely will come again and agai

Me and my husband were suggested to visit this place for the first time by our friends. What I like about this restaurant, the ambience I felt was relax and captivating. The foods which we ordered were well cook and the taste were just right to our taste bud. We ordered Butter Chicken and Pattaya Fried Rice which we like it so much. Two service providers which I would like to compliment are Mr Santosh and Mr Rayhaan. They had given an excellent service which made me and my husband will definitely patronise again. Well done and I will definitely share this wonderful experience with my friends and colleagues.Best regardsMya Aviann

Happy hour for beer not wine (not clearly advertised). Food very average. Will not be going back. Disappointing experience
5
The service here is excellent! They take initiative to serve you and attend to your needs before you even request for it. Special shout out to the Indian fellow!
4
a great Sunday early dinner option. Thai dishes and yummy Indian dishes and curry are what Baa Baa has to offer. The restaurant is quick, and efficient and its always reliably good and delicious.
5
We come here from time to time, Great ciders & we like the Thai food a lot. Service is very good and friendly. No service charge, so make sure to tip if you like it!

I've been visiting Bar Bar for some time now. While I initially ate there, the signs about 'not asking for water' and long explanation about tips eventually made me do a takeaway and get out of there.Bar Bar has a variety of cuisines and my personal view is that when one does a bit of everything, they can't really be good at them.The burgers are very mediocre. The Thai food was not really flavorful.There are a lot of Indian options and I've only found the Lamb kabab and the Green Chicken Kabab to be worth the effort
5
We came across this place before going for a walk in Botanic Gardens. This bar is not in the small centre but at the corner opposite the MRT station. They offer a large selection of Thai, Indian and Western Food and the tax and service charge is already included in the prices. The staff were friendly and helpful.
4
Had book this place for gathering with friends. Just next to Singapore Botanic Gardens Station. Is a family friendly cafe. They did provide kids meal. Foods we order is good and in reasonable price. Love the Thai foods here. But we cant taste all in one time. Hope to go back again. The only con is ventilation. Not cooling enough
5
Bar Bar Black Sheep is really close to the beautiful botanic gardens. My mum and I had a lovely evening here. The ambience is relaxed and lovely, and the service was fantastic. In particular, Adam and Murugan were especially attentive and made our time here that much better. Thank you! We will definitely be back again

I took my girl friend to this restaurant for a brand new experience on my birthday celebration.Usually bored celebrating it in other restaurants..this was a good experience..My girlfriend and me really had a good time..Amazing views.good place for couples and family.food exquisite.service exceptional.Especially a staff over there Santosh was remarkably good in his service..very good value.great wine and another birthday cake.Cheers Marce

Have been coming back to this bar almost every week ever since my first visit. The bar has really good service with commendable staff. Friendly and at the same time professional with whatever they do. Seriously recommend this place as this is not only where you enjoy time with your friends, but also feel like home. Special shout out to the staffs "Gurween" who took care of us and made sure that we have been enjoying our time here never failing to make a memorable experience at the sheep. P.s the food here is tasty and value for money.

Of two minds about writing a review after seeing the somewhat defensive responses (well you have a like-minded twin at Ce La Vie if you see their response to my not so flattering review!) from this establishment to earlier not so positive reviews. Disclaimer:1. Less than 5% of my ratings are below average 2. Before the above are written, there is a check to see that there are others who think the same way hence similar ratings3. These are meant to make readers aware that there are other better options out there and the overall reviews are out there for them to judge.So here goes:This place services average Western food of food court standards but at premium prices. However its cosy location in Cluny Court is a pull. Better for beer with finger food but have a proper meal somewhere else

I frequent this restaurant but usually for drinks in the evening. This weekend my family and I decided to hold my mothers birthday party there with a couple of close friends. The food was amazing and the staff were very pleasant to deal with. Despite our numerous request they were happy to accommodate us and were pleasant to deal with the whole afternoon. Their manager Ash was great to deal with even before the actual event. All our guest had an awesome time and loved the location. Nice little courtyard and comfortable environment. We will definitely go back to barbar black sheep and i believe that many of our guest will as well. Give it a go you will be pleasantly surprised
5
I frequently visit this restaurant and It never seems to disappoint me. This tucked away little jewel offers a variety of cuisine from western, local, Thai and Indian. Personally I believe that the Indian food here is amazing and one of the best I have tried in Singapore! With an casual aroma and pleasant service I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal
5
This is a frequent go to place for no strings hawker style food with pluses, there are 3 locations around and about, the best thing I always enjoy are Tetley's butter on draught and great Indian food. Best dhal makhni and naan I know in Singapore.
2
My first experience at BBBS. We ordered plenty of drinks as we had a celebration going on. BBBS's policy is not to allow for a single glass of tap water. In my opinion, this is cheating customers and does not help having a nice opinion of the place and staff.

I would like to take a few moments and thank the staffs at Bar Bar Black Sheep who worked the SAS event I organized at BBBS on Thursday, December 17, 2014. This is actually the third event I have held at the restaurant (September 2013, December 2013 & December 2014).First of all, I would like to say that I have had the most positive experience, and the main reason we have returned to host multiple events at your establishment is because of your General Manager, Ash. Ash was the first person who contacted me in April 2013 when I first wrote and enquired about having a social event at BBBS. Ash contacted me within hours of receiving my initial e-mail and was extremely helpful when I had numerous questions about hosting a large event beginning in late afternoon and running into the evening. Ash was clear in his communication and helped planned our first event. This was important because I wanted to make sure we had enough food and that I also stayed within my budget. The rest is history - we have now hosted three events at BBBS and they are by far the favorite of events of the year that is sponsored by SAS. All people in attendance are quick to ask me when we will be able to return and come back to BBBS. Ash is also very conscientious of who he staffs to work our events.....and we are very lucky for all staff that is present are top-notice and totally commit themselves to great service for our guests. This is noticed for more than a few people have said to me what great service they received. A special shout out to Reagan for he has worked all three of our events and always has everything under control and makes sure all is going smoothly at all times. All the staff working at BBBS have been wonderful - I am sorry I am not sure of all their names. I think the best compliment is that the people I have invited for our gathering love the food and have returned with their families. For our events we usually order Garlic and cheese naan, Samosas, Spring rolls, Chicken Tikka, Calamari, Chicken Drumlets and Chicken Enchiladas. All the food disappears - which means everyone likes the variety and the taste. Coming back to eat again on their own time proves that people are very happy with all BBBS has to offer.Thank you for providing such great service, food and atmosphere. We will return again for our events.With Appreciation,m

The entrance itself is slightly hard to find, but once you get in it's a nice, laid back place. The ambience is cozy and unpretentious, and not too crowded on a Sunday evening. We only tried the Indian food here, so can't speak for the Thai or Western stuff. We got the dal makhani and the palak paneer, both of which were really good. The dal particularly is one of the best we've had in Singapore (and we've tried dal makhani at pretty much every Indian place here). Value for money too - Food for 2 was around 27sgdReading the other reviews, people seem to have had issues with the service, but that wasn't the case with us. The only slightly long wait we had was for the check, but not inordinately so.Overall, a good place to visit for some good indian food in a relaxed setting

If you've never been to Cluny Court, it's a chichi, colonial building that bursts at the seams with expat ladies who do lunch, antiques checking, Cold Storage deli shopping, manicures, handcrafted toys etc. Sit yourself to be seen at the outdoor terrace of Da Paolo but don't venture into Bar Bar Black sheep.Went to meet a friend for coffee and a light bite before lunchtime rush, but my iced coffee was the brown coloured dregs from the machine, the mango pudding so vile looking that we didn't dare break into its plasticky crust. Four items and the bill was wrong...!? Despite being the only 2 people when we sat down, we still had to ask for the menu. Oh, what did I expect when the menu offer Western, Indian and Thai food? Jack of all trades and master of none, to be remembered for the future
2
The food in this place is over rated. I ate chicken (chicken windaloo) and the meat was so sticky that I couldnt get my fork in. So this was the first and the last time there
5
Love this al fresco place! I can come here, chill and eat good food that's varied and not over priced. Thai and Indian cuisine is excellent - haven't tried the western, why should I? Boring! What I especially like is that the staff is open and upfront - " if we're frantically busy and you can't seem to get hold of us, do feel free to come to the counter to get our attention and place an order". No worries - at least one knows! Tipping is discretionary but they've earned it every time and I frequent once weekly at least. I can't say I've ever had a negative experience nor a bad meal. The Indian cuisine is particularly excellent.And if dinner isn't your thing, then a beer after a walk in the Botanic Gardens is easy enough - it's right next to the MRT
3
me and my friends went there during my training.
the place is quite hidden from main street,
the food is delightful and tasty.
food and beer prices is quite fair.
2
Expensive, lacks the atmosphere of its other outlets... and poor service. if you enjoy average food , pay a lot and sit in a hole in the wall ... this is it
4
Went here with my son as it is pretty close to where he lives. The drinks were nice and cool, service very polite and the price most reasonable. Only draw back is that the courtyard looks a bit shabby and could do with a bit of upgrading to enhance the experience.A pleasant outing and it didn't break the ban
1
We had lunch at this cafe. It was our first visit after reading rave reviews by prominent local food bloggers.Firstly, no one greets you when you enter this cafe. The entrance is off the main entrance but there are sufficient signages. You can sit anywhere.Secondly, although they have set lunch menu on weekdays, you need to ask for the menu. Otherwise, order from the ala carte. Thirdly, they don't serve water. We tried the north indian menu and the western grill. The Thai kitchen was closed on Mondays.The food portion was only generous on the carbos eg. Rice, bread and fries. The chicken tikka was not hot, only warm and became cold in a while.The fish curry had deep fried fish chunks which didn't taste fresh. Any foodie can tell you when the fish is deep fried, it is usually not fresh.Service was slow and food was worse than hawker centre
5
I have flicked through some of the reviews here and find them hard to believe. I am a regular at Cluny Court "Bar Bar". Even the sheep on the bar knows me.One of the reasons I keep coming back is the laid back, quiet ambience and the friendliness of the staff. These guys (and lady) serve promptly and have good observational skills (unlike most local waiters/waitresses). I have always had excellent service both for food and for drink. I've never had silly charges levied and the staff always seem to work hard from my stance.There is a lack of bars in this area and most cafes/restaurants have appallingly slothful service unless they get their quota of hard-working experienced staff. This is also one of the few venues in this residential area where I can watch sport, or which plays a good cross-section of piped music.No doubt, I will be there again over the weekend - it is a pity it doesn't open until 5.30 pm and closes early in the week. It always seems to be buzzing on the many occasions I visit and I expect most punters are very happy - I see many people returning, especially as groups for birthday celebrations etc.I will remain a firm fan (especially of the chicken tikka!). It is not one of your 6-star, SGD200/person venues, but then I can take home change from a SGD50 note for a decent, well-prepared, unpretentious meal and a beer or three. If I want Sky on 57, I'll go to Sky on 57. Meanwhile, long may Bar Bar be open to me as an oasis surrounded by mediocre local businesses. Great for being alone, or meeting there with friends. Would be even better with a little of bit of spending by the owner on further enhancing the very handy courtyard, which has a lot of potential.And

My wife and I went for dinner on Wednesday at 6 pm. There is a short path from the main road that leads to this bar cum restaurant. If you are searching for this bar, if not for a small white signboard at the main road, this bar is not easily found.The bar offers a range of food from Northern Indian, Thai, and local cuisine to western grill. The western grill seems to be their specialty because it had many 'chef's recommendation' listed in their menu.The bar is dimly lit as expected of any bar, with sufficient light where the tables are situated. The background music is soothing and not blaring. The air is mixed with the aroma of Indian spices and the smell of grease because the open kitchen is exposed to the bar. The table felt sticky to touch because of the grease from the kitchen.We made our order, chicken briyani and char-grilled chicken. I also asked for two glasses of warm water which we would have gladly paid for. We were told they had no warm water, only bottled water. No warm water? A bar that has all kinds of beverages, alcoholic, non-alcoholic, cocktails,etc., does not serve warm water? What a let down.Also, the person who briefly served us did not seem warm (no pun intended) and friendly. Good and friendly service is the pinnacle of any great culinary experience. This was somewhat lacking in the bar. Everybody working in the bar seemed indifferent and preoccupied and the bar was not even crowded at that time. Their black outfits, coupled with their cheerless faces made the place dimmer.The briyani was good. It had succulent pieces of chicken, and ample spices that gave it a good flavor. However, apart from chicken it only had tomato and chopped coriander leaves. What would have made this good briyani great would be less oil and less salt, and a sprinkle of cashew nuts and raisins.The char-grilled chicken came with lettuce sprinkled with balsamic vinegar, and sliced mushrooms. The cream sauce on the chicken was overwhelming. If the sauce was reduced, the dish would be a lot better.After the meal, I walked up to the counter to pay my bill. The person who served us also doubled up as the cashier. As he gave me the change, his face was turned away. There was no smile, no 'thank you' and no 'please come again'. I did not feel valued as a customer.A restaurant can serve great food but with indifferent staff and poor service, I am thankful that Singapore has other bars and restaurants to choose from.Will I go back again to Bar Bar Black Sheep? Well since I did not feel valued as a customer, why bother

Choice is good and reasonably priced. Atmosphere is OK: there is tv on showing soccer but for many tables you would have to look over your shoulder but the sound is on throughout the roomFood is OK: the fish and chips good, the burger and two types of curry average. Nachos was poor (bowl of nachos out of a nacho bag?)Two disappointments: a) food was served on a rolling timetable: i.e. first nachos appetiser, then within a minute came main course for two persons, then 5 minutes later the other two main courses b) have to pay for bottled water (2.90 small bottle? I forget): no tap water availabl
2
Bar Bar Black Sheep offers three different menus: Thai, Western and Northern Indian. The choice is almost too much, but we found that the food was good. The atmosphere is somewhat like an American bar, bustling and pleasantly noisy.Whilst I understand that the occasional order can get lost, what I do not accept is a poor response from management.Our drinks took 20 minutes to arrive and only after a reminder to the waitress. How difficult is it to pour a couple of cokes and one milkshake?Our food was took about an hour to arrive. When we asked to talk the manager, he said that the restaurant was busy. When it was pointed out that the couple next to us had already received their order 20 minutes ago, he said that they had ordered different food. When it arrived, our food came at different times and one of the orders was wrong. How long does it take to cook a burger?Whilst the food was good, and my friends said they had come before and had no problems, I was very disappointed with the manager's reaction to our complaints. I would have been satisfied with an apology (none given) and admitting that they had lost our order. Instead we got excuses. What would have been better (and normal from a good restaurant) is to offer us free drinks.You may enjoy the good food, but if it goes astray, do not expect good service from these people

It was my first time to Bar Bar Black Sheep (Cluny Courtyard) last Sunday for dinner with a bunch of good friends. The decoration was quite interesting, just a simple pub. I had read quite a few negative comments in trip advisor at other branch. I was mentally prepared but dun mind to go for a try. I asked for a glass of plain water and the waiter said they dun serve water for free unless I buy their drinking bottle. It was fine as some of the restaurants did the same thing. It took more than 15 minutes and my drinking bottle has not arrived yet till one of my friends had to go to the counter bar to ask for one.We ordered their Thai food set that serves for 6 pax. They were very generous for their fragrant rice but we dun eat so much of rice. Kinda of waste. We also ordered indian food, malasa chicken was good too. We were quite pleased with our dishes. We tried to order hot beverages after dinner. They said their machine was down. So we have to order cold beverages. Their iced latte were good. We wanted to order more iced lattes and they said they sold all. We left with no choice but to order coke light and iced lemon tea. Basically they do not walk around to clear the dishes on the table, and left us a lot of freedom to chill. After that I realized that they did not charge us on service charge and also no GST. That explained all. They depended customers to give tips. Probably the management have to train their staff to improve their service and use more initiative to see what customers' needs so that more tips to reward them for their initiative and service excellence

Little better fair than standard Pub Food however overall feel of the place is like a pub.Good selection of food on offer and we had a mixture of Thai and Indian Cuisane which was quite good and reasonable value for money.Service was a little slow as they appear to be a little light on serving staff.Good place to take Kids as wel
3
one of my friend who live in singapore guided me here. the service is not so good, but i love the food which is so delicious and various.
4
Good variety of dishes of reasonable value for money. Service is sometimes a bit slow but overall pleasant. Relaxed atmosphere.
4
Cute little place with wide variety of food. I had a question about the dish and the chef came out to answer my questions- very nice of him. Food was delicious. Service was average for Singapore (meaning it was terrible by US standards)
5
Individual cooks for the different food types. We tried the currys which were really tasty and enormous portions. Good value for money too.

Living in Singapore, my family have been to BBBS quite a few times, especially the Cluny Court location, as it is close to home.Tonight we arrived, ordered our meals and drinks. My husbands meal arrived, no drinks yet!! about 10 mins later a waiter arrived with our drinks- 2 bottled waters and 2 beers. Absolutely useless, he spilt the beer all over my 5 yo. No apologies, no one offered to bring a cloth to help clean up my child now dripping in beer.I went in to ask for assistance, the first staff member told me to ask someone else. Finally someone arrived with paper napkins. Food arrived for the rest of us at the same time as our drinks. No apologies.Absolutely hopeless and we will NEVER be returning and telling our friends about this experience

Have been a frequent visitor of Bbbs outlets, and this one is no exception; great variety and value, with the added advantage of a classier and really chill atmosphere- aircon indoors (a barbar first!) and a cool courtyard outside.. like a hidden treasure of sorts. Aside from the usual indian/western/thai, The food menu also includes local delights, and the mee rebus /nasi lemak we tried was sedap... Don't think the other Bbbs outlets carry this. I frequent barbar at cherry avenue too for the rustic vibe- my house is right in between both outlets; More wines and liquors here tho. on that note- dasani bottled water is only $1 nett! If that isnt awesome value, i duno what is. And All Bbbs outlets operate as a coffee shop model and therefore cannot give free water - give them a break. No idea why people would complain about this, when the prices arent much higher than a food court, you get full table service with no service charge, and the ambience is much better. Try asking your "kopi tiam" drink stall auntie for free ice water, and see what she says? They do make exceptions though, we've seen sloshed patrons after one Johnny walker too many being given bottled water out of goodwill. Still the only place I know to get such premium liquor at these prices
1
Very small portions, the only place in Singapore I know of where you cannot get ice water and are forced to buy bottled, and overpriced for what you get. The place was deserted, which is what the owner's 'squeeze 'em dry' attitude will do to any good place. This is a shame, because the Bar Bar a couple K's down the road (Bukit Timah) is so good, so fair and so pleasant - we were hoping for the same experience and were very disappointed
4
The hardest thing I find when we go out for dinner with the kids (6 and 9) is what they will eat. The good thing about BB Blacksheep is the range of choices available for them to select - we can always find something they will like and unlike McD's we can always find something my wife and I can choose from in the local or Indian menus. What a relief

Went on Sunday night when it was very quiet (I believe there was only one other table occupied when we came to pay our bill). One of our party did warn us that the service was bad before we began. It was a bit slack but not remarkably so until we asked for the bill.We gave the waiter a single credit card, no cash. 5 min later, we chased for the payment slip. The same waiter came back with the bill again. Clearly, he did not remember he had given us the bill already, even though it was only 5 mins earlier and he had done nothing since besides watch the TV. He went back to the bar, then returned saying we hadn't given him the card. After several minutes of panic on our side (were we being ripped off, now we would have to cancel the card), we eventually found the card where he had dropped it, on the floor in between our table and the bar.How he could have dropped the card and then forgotten he even had it is beyond me. He only had one job, to carry a card twenty feet and give it to the bar manager. What did he think when he got to the bar and found he didn't have cash or a card as payment? In that situation, I would have also expected the manager to act - he just stayed behind and let the waiter deal with it. I'd have expected at least a real apology and probably some free drinks, but perhaps he was just used to such incompetence.Avoid
3
They have 3 full menus of Thai, Indian and Western so if you can't decide what you feel like then go here! The waiter very helpfully told us when we arrived that a table of 20 had just ordered burgers etc. off the Western menu so he suggested we choose something else or we would be waiting a long time. We thought that was nice!We went on a weekday (Wed I think?) and it was very busy! It is not a big space and enclosed behind Cluny Court. We sat inside. I think there is an outdoor area but there is no view. The bar serves a range of beers so good for beer lovers. There were a few kids and we took our baby in a stroller but just had to lift if up a few stairs. Once in there it was a little tight where we were sitting near the kitchen with the stroller as well. The food was good, not great, but good for a family dinner out.I wouldn't suggest it for a special occasion, special date or work meeting even. A couple next to us were obviously having a work discussion and we heard every word. It was bustling so the atmosphere so more bar-like. They also don't serve tap water and ask you to pay for bottled water. Not a big deal to us but the woman next to us kicked up quite a fuss and then they brought her tap water. We probably won't be back just because there are so many other places to choose from which are more open (with a bit of a view), less crowded and with better food
