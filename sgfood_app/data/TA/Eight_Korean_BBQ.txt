We had an excellent dinner here. It gets a bit warm and smokey with the bbq at the table but everything was hot, fresh and delicious. Definitely worth a try!!

Good food, good service. First time there so the waiter patiently explained the menu options and gave good recommendations for us. Spot on ! The waiter also does the BBQ cooking for you and it is cooked to the "doneness" that you reqiest. The other plus point is that you don't smell like a piece of BBQ meat after you leave.Lighting was a little dim but adequate
4
This restaurant has dim lighting and excellent K-pop playing on the mounted TV screens. We had the Argentinian ribeye, pork neck and seafood pancake. The items were well executed. We would have appreciated a bigger variety of small dishes (banchan) though. We counted only 6. Overall, we enjoyed the food.

We first tried 8 Korean BBQ in Seoul. It blew our mind. When we heard about them opening a store in Singapore, we jumped at the chance to try it. The taste didn't failed us. Meat was succulent and well marinated. Just like how we tasted it in Seoul. Although we are limited by the variety of vegetables we can get in Singapore, it did not diminish the whole experience.Price here is on the high side compared to Korea. The price for 2 pax in Singapore would feed 3 in Seoul
5
First time visiting the restaurant. Seek waitress' help to order. She patiently advise and introduce the types of dishes they cater in the menu. The meat are very well marinated. Looks little but when the waiter starts to BBQ for us, the portion is actually quite a lot and filling. The staff helped us to BBQ and cook the stew. So we don't have to cook anything at all. Jus have to enjoy eating. Very good service! And after coming out from the restaurant the odour on my clothes is not too strong

Went to the outlet at Shaw Centre, service is good. Our server was friendly, chatty and accommodated our requests for additional radish. The place also has covered containers for your bags to prevent the BBQ smell from getting to them. One of those restaurants where they BBQ the stuff for you and all you need to do is relax and eat. The food is not authentic Korean though, so if you are looking for that this is not the place for you. Having said that the food is good in itself. We ordered the seafood pancake (crispy-good!), seafood beancurd stew, spicy chicken thigh (was over cooked with a lot of burnt bits), and kimchi fried rice

Having savoured 8 Korean BBQ in Los Angeles Korean Town a few times, I finally got to taste its equivalent back home here in Clark Quay Central. 8 Color Set - The unique style of preparing 8 differently seasoned belly pork (Hungarian Mangalitza Hog) remains basically the same with slightly varied side dishes. Not sure whether it's due to supply source or otherwise, I noticed that the belly pork here is rather more fatty. Nevertheless the tastes of the different styles remain good. Unfortunately we got them all mixed up and couldn't pinpoint which flavours tasted better. Generally other dishes we ordered were also good. Don't forget to wash down the oily stuff with the very satisfying Passion Makgeolli. The meal was satisfying but somehow my preference remains with the original outlet in Los Angeles

Had went over to Eight Korean over the weekend with my family. We had ordered the 4 coloured set, portion and taste wasn't all that great.Food was not tasty, it was lacking in authentic Korean flavour. Banchan served were very limited and are not refillable, which was shocking for a Korean restaurant.For its value, you're better off finding a cheaper and family owned Korean restaurant along Tanjong Pagar road. Would not come back again, and definitely would not recommend

Ordered : 8Colour Set & U.S Beef Prime Rib. Quality of meats were fantastic and considering that, the prices are value for money. Side dishes were lacklusture, and in small portions, i.e.: 3 pieces of baby potatoes for a table of 4 and no refill. You can find better banchan elsewhere. Kimchi and bean sprouts kimchi were not too bad. As with most Korean BBQ joints, the service staff will offer to cook the meats for you but usually as I prefer to do my own grilling I requested to do so but was told by the service staff that I CAN'T do so. Tts shocking, as a customer don't I have the rights to choose to do my own grilling?! As these are really great cuts of meats. The service staff took over and as expected the first 4 slabs of meats were ruined. The grill was not hot and a piece of wax paper was placed atop the meats to prevent oil splatters but that resulted in a steaming effect of the meats. BBQ-ing of meats should have a prefect slight char on the outside and still juicy on the inside. But what we got were steamed pork bellies that greatly disappointed due to poor grilling skills. When she came along the second round, I insisted that I would really prefer to cook it myself to prevent future wreckage to such great pieces of meat. Don't know if it's a hard and fast rule? I'm aware she's just doing her job but if you're in a BBQ joint and can't do a good job at grilling meats, why can't we as customers DIY instead?She came to check on us a few times and kept lowering the heat on the grill affecting the heat required to cook the meats and I was told off by her as she said high heat will result in damage of the hotplate?!!!If this was so then why choose such a piece of equipment that would easily damage under high heat if you're running a BBQ Joint?!!!!!We visited on a Sat evening and it was crowded and packed as usual so the way we were served and how she cooked the meat for us was done in a way that seemed rushed and without much care. If the standard protocol is that customers are not allowed to cook their own meats and only the service staff are allowed to do the cooking, I would not return. But if management can clarify their stand on this, the quality of meats is worth a return visit.

~my brother in law recommended Mangalitsa pig & at this Korean BBQ I'd brough my colleagues out to lunch back in 2016Jun~at level 2 Blue Zone, without a reservation the 4 of us walked in at opening hour and ordered an 8 color set (these sets are expensive)...~the seats are hollow, so you can pry off the top and shove your bags into them... just remember to grab them out while leaving :)~there are drawers just below the table where the utensils are kept~a Cold Water Flask is $2, this place would rather you drink Soju or Beer and the many ways you can drink both of them together are illustrated in the menu~an ample range of condiments are brought out ala Korean style that filled the table~the cooking is performed by the wait staff and the hot plate is slanted so that flow juices can be collected in a cup. when a fresh batch of pork is placed on the tray oil may splatter so a cooking paper is placed over it to contain heat and evenly cook the meat strip above and below~the dessert Bingsu is amazing but at $28ea an order to share is prolly the ideaSteamed Egg - i dunno about this but it costs and awful lot to afford this8 Color Set - $98 somewhat YUMzNew 8 Color Set - $98 it's actually taste YUMzSeafood Soft Tofu Upgrade & Army Stew Upgrade - well worth the adonKim Cheese Fried Rice - dude it's $20 each, we'd 2 helpings and still not enough, it is SUPER YUMzBibimbap Bingsu - @$28 even shared it's really not mid-priced YUMzBOTTOMLINE, guys you spend a HUGE bomb even without drinks, not for an everyday outing but when you wanna splurge and have a group party...!NSFR = Not Safe For Romantics

The food here is quite good, and price is reasonable. Best of all, the staff cooked the food for you :)
5
They offer a great marinated pork, beef. The service is good, Got the table outside is better because you can enjoy the view of river.
5
Food was awesome. Great Atmosphere (we sat outside)
Service far exceeded our expectations. We were in a slight rush and they took care of us right away. Definitely going back
5
Just had a great meal at the Shaw house branch, food was awesome! We arrived 5 mins before closing and they served us without any fuss, the food was excellent made even better by Vanessa helping to cook our food for us Korean bbq beginners. Would highly recommend for anyone either couples or groups of friends, definite 5 star

I have always heard of @Eight Korean BBQ but never had a chance until we ran out of ideas for Korean BBQ. And well...we were not disappointed at all! We had the Wagyu and 8 Colours of pork, which was really tasty especially with the pork cooking in its own fat. Wagyu on the other hand was ok but not heavenly Wagyu. We also had the makgeolli. Went well with the meat and ended with the bimbinbap dessert. Almost got everyone fooled that its another savoury! Hah

2016 Nov 27 Dinner @Eight Korean BBQ To Celebrate My Niece's Birthday. Food & Service Were Good. Staff Will BBQ The Meat For Us. When Finish BBQ, Staff Cleaning Up The Table, My Sister Say She Has Ordered 3 Bimbimbap, My Reaction Is "HUH?" Serious, How To Finish?!But Incredibly We Finished All Bimbimbap BingsuIs Nice(Hint: Is Not Rice!)Bimbimbap (Mixed Rice, Different Type Of Veg On Rice Topped With A Egg In A Hot Pot Then Mix And Eat)PatBingsu Pat = Red Bean Bingsu = IceAnd Added Ingredients Like Strawberries, Grape, Cookies, Cereal Etc, And Topped With Whip Cream And Half Peach On Shaved IcePatBingsu That Looks Like Bimbimbap And Eat It As If Is Bimbimbap. Instead Of Add Red Bean Paste Sauce, This Can Add Chocolate SyrupPersonally Feel After All The BBQ, Having This Ice Is Much Better Than Eating Cake

So disappointed. The so called pork belly is almost purely animal fat... ordered the eight color set cost 80+??? And most of the food had to be discarded due to the amount of fat... don't get me wrong, it is just not real K BBQ pork belly. Wondering who is willing pay so much for a pile of pure animal fat after knowing the truth... terrible..

Visited this place for lunch. First impressions - nice dark decor, airy spacious layout. Not very crowded. This is really a place for an elaborate BBQ dinner or extended lunch, so if you are looking for a quick meal this is not the place.There is a set lunch menu which is quite unattractive. The a la carte prices are on the higher side. I got a bibimbap which was good. Very large portion. But the place takes just too long to serve even when they are relatively empty.Won't return in a hurr
4
Looking for a unique Korean BBQ pork? try their 8 flavours pork strips. but be prepared to be oily. Food wise I rate it 7.5/10 Service wise due to lack of men power 6/10going in a big group? suggestion to divide your group into fours. best group size will be four

When a supplier came to Singapore and wanted to visit Clarke Quay in the evening, I chose this restaurant since the guest preferred grill meat. The restaurant looks worn out and dated. Simple wooden tables with steel bins stools complete the setting. The ventilation in the main dinning hall was bad. I guessed that if I had dined inside, I would have smelled like a piece of BBQ meat when I left and I would have perspired heavily. We decided to opt for the seating outside at the deck overlooking Singapore River. However, the trees had since grown taller and had blocked the river view.We selected a Pork Flower set which was meant for 2, a kimchi stew and a squid. Together with 1 beer, these cost us almost SGD150. Too much for the quantity and quality. The 3 types of pork was only enough for 2 small eaters. The quality of the cuts were just average.Service is just average. Halfway through our dinner, someone switch off the outdoor lights and left us in darkness for 10 minutes till we are unable see what we are eating and had to ask them to switch back on. I will not recommend for business dinners. But having said that, even a causal dinner is not worth the price we paid.

Quality of the meat did not justify the high prices. There are definitely better places to go to.
Also not friendly for a couple date as the portions (and prices) are large.
3
The seafood stew was not tasty. Limited compliment and usually Korean Restaurant will give at least 5 choices. The prices are too expensive. The staff are pretty attentive. It will be a place for meat eaters !
2
The terrasse is not even confortable. You will receive on your head the kitchen ventilation.
It is a very expensive place and it doesn't worth it.
A lot of products : beverages (alcohol and softs) and meats weren't availables.

The problem with Singapore as one local told me is that meat imports are expensive as they do not have the land for rearing their own. So you either go to somewhere where the prices are high to get the good meat or you go to a place where the meat is on the fatty side and the less desirable cuts. This has the latter but with the prices that don't match the quality. The premise is good you sit at the table where your food is brought to you and it is heated and cooked in front of you so you "can get it while its hot". Apart from the meat issue the rest of the food is actually good and tasty with lots of flavours and certainly some spice, if you like that sort of thing.Despite it all it is popular especially on the weekends so either get there early or try during the week

I would rarely write bad reviews, but Eight Korean BBQ deserves this attention. Horrible service, low-quality & overpriced fat (note: not advertised meat), almost no fresh vegetables.. The ginseng chicken soup for SGD 28++ comes for the rescue? Hardly. Uncooked, tasteless, so hard it has to be cut with scissors to even get to any meat. Never again

I went to 8 Korean bbq with a group of friends and let them know I had a shellfish allergy. They understood, took it into account and even replaced the cooking plate after they realised there was shrimp paste in one of the dishes. As a bonus the food was great with fantastic quality meat, brilliant service and reasonably priced. I will be back and recommend.

First of all the food was allright, but everything else was really dissapointing about this place. Try to avoid it and go somewhere else. My girlfriend (who is korean and had her fair share of korean BBQ in her life) and I were really hungry for some pork belly and actually looked up some nice places in the central business district but they were all closed because it was sunday evening (I dont really get why). We went then to this place and only regretted it.1. After we read the menu and were ready to order it took very long to place the order eventhough not even half the places were taken. They kept us waiting nearly 15 minutes.2. The selection of sidedishes was extremely poor and not what u expect from an korean Restaurant. We got a bit of squid, some weird seaweed and some radish. Nothing really interesting or outstanding (in particular considering the extremely high price).3.The staff was extremely unattendive. They started grilling the Kimchi. When the kimchi started burning we needed to switch of the bbq by ourself. It took than another ten minutes until our stew arrived. After asking three times when our meat finally arrives, and we were waiting for ages in front of our burned kimchi and overcooking stew they finally were so kind to bring our porkbelly. Just bring everything at the same time. The place was relatively empty and there was plenty of staff, but they were completely uncoordinated. U have to bring a plate of raw pork belly which has most likely been marinated long before. Does that really take 30 minutes plus while ruining all the other foods?4. The price was ridiculously high. We paid for pork belly for 2 persons 68 $. We had some cheese fried rice with it and a bucket with 5 beers. Our grand total was for everything 108 which is already pretty expensive for just pork belly and a couple of beers, but I was then okay with it since I am on holiday and the food was okay. This amount did not include Service Charge and Tax. Are you kidding me? So we ended up paying 140 $ Dollars for this horrible experience. That is more than 100 Euros. Germany is not a cheap country, but with that money I can have a pretty upscale dinner and not eat pork belly. At least I expect with that kind of money that the place is run professional. I have been to plenty of korean bbq places that were much less expensive, were the staff did not ignore u and which offered you more than this place.Dont go here, this place is overpriced, the staff is incappable of running this place properly and the food was okay but our mood was already affected and extremely bad.AVOID!!

Having spent about 3 years in S.Korea, I have developed the LOVE for Korean food. Needless to say, from time to time I really crave for it. Here in Singapore, it took me quite a while to finally find a few good restaurants that serve authentic Korean dishes. Glad to say that not very long ago another bbq place has been added to my list of "where to go when the crave kicks in". Over the weekend, my husband and two friends of ours have decided to try a new Korean restaurant. This is how we got to have great dinner at "8 Korean BBQ" I'll start with service. To cut it short, it is satisfactory - friendly & efficient. Food - excellent! Except for the "gyeran chim" that is a bit blunt, all the things we ordered are yummy. We had wagyu beef and 4 kinds of pork belly - garlic, herb, original & red pepper paste. We also had army soup, dry cold noodles, 3 bowls of rice and seafood korean pizza. Drinks, the gentlemen had korean beers and us ladies had cola. Now, the side dishes - a bit limited and not on the so hardcore Korean side but at least the basics are there like really nice Kimchi and well-seasoned bean sprout. Most importantly, they top up the side dishes. Just request for it and the staffs are more than happy to give you more! Atmosphere is lively. Perhaps on a bit of discomfort side is that the place isn't very big and you'll surely kind of smell like a bbq after dinner but this is just a very small inconvenience compared to the good food u'll get to savour. All in all, with super full stomach and satisfying experience, we ended up with a 250sgd bill. For 4 pacs who ate like crazy, it's actually a decent deal. Will surely recommend to friends and colleagues of mine who have the love for Korean food!!! Almost forgot, will promote to my Korean friends, too :

Come here for good meat and you will not be disappointed! Beef and korean soup that reminds me of Korea. Just thinking about this place makes me want to eat Korean food NOW! Make a reservation in advance as this place gets crowded. The rice wine was especially worth it, huge bottle and not too expensive.
4
We all enjoyed the food. It was fresh and tasty, and although it was our first time, we had an idea of what sort of things to expect. We were there yesterday lunch time, so it was pretty busy. The staff were a little overstretched but at least it meant we could take our time. We find it quite a common issue in Singapore that they don't have enough staff to cover the busy periods, but here at least the staff were trying hard to serve everyone as best they could. I would recommend Eight, but advise to go at quieter time
4
One of the finest Korean bbq's I have had. We sat outside, inside it seemed too noisy for me. Outside it is overlooking Clarke Quay which is very nice.
5
Recently they are bringing in Manglica pork bellies for their BBQs and I tell you, they are damn awesome! They are juicy and tender and these fats are actually healthy fats!
4
Good location and great people. Set menu is strongly recommended. Kimchi fried rice was also nice.
will I go back? Yes, definitely.

Service: The service was poor. It wasn't a particularly busy evening, but the waiter was not attentive. The menu was not clearly explained to us, so we ended up ordering the wrong soup base.Food: The food was extremely fattening. It was interesting that the meat was fried in front of us, but I was splattered with a bit of oil. Atmosphere: The restaurant was very noisy, as a few TVs were showing pop Korean singing and dancing. This sort of pop culture atmosphere in a restaurant was not to my taste. All in all, this restaurant did not live up to our family's expectations
5
A warm welcome greeted us here. As newbies to Korean food, staff were very willing to explain everything and their recommendations were excellent. There were just the two of us so we had the 4 piece set menu. The food was plentiful and there was no problem swapping the set menu stew for a different flavour we were keen to try. We really enjoyed our experience and will definitely be back. Food and service were really very good and we thought it good value for Singapore which can be pricey.We think this would be fun for those in a large group although we would suggest those with very young children should consider carefully as the bbq is in the centre of the table and can get hot

If you are crazy about pork bellies then this restaurant is hands down the best in Singapore. Ever since our experience with Mangalica, my partner and I have been scouring all over Singapore for a reasonably priced mangalica experience. Finally our prayers have been answered thanks to Tripadvisor!Let's begin :) As you approach the restaurant, the thick smell of BBQ goodness is in the air, oh yes, your stomach starts growling in anticipation, make no mistake, your sense of smell is tickled even before you enter 8 korean bbq. It was a saturday and packed, note to self, MAKE A RESERVATION! Host was kind enough to sit both of us down and we wasted no time in scanning the menu.Ordering was fairly straightforward with either the 4 colour or 8 colour set, numbers referring to the strips of bellies served. Wait staff were extremely helpful and efficient (full house with 6 visible servers, amazing). We decided to do the 4 colour set and the army stew.When the bellies arrived, we knew straightaway this was the real deal, signature lard of the decadent kind, not your typical lean belly you will see anywhere else. Every bite was heaven right down to the last morsel, even basic essentials in the form of lettuce and kimchi were very fresh, we could find no fault. We finished off with their signature korean patbingsu icy dessert served meaningfully on a freezing stone pot.This is an amazing restaurant, straight to the point pork belly goodness. If you have to spend your next dollar on quality pork bellies, look no further, nothing can beat the MANGALICA in terms of taste, texture and wholesome goodness. Definitely coming BACK!!!!

I have only compliments for the food = 3 thumbs up!But behind the "friendly" faces lurk rude and insulting servers. Most visitors probably compliment the "good" service because they do not understand what the Filipino servers comment when they exchange communication amongst themselves in Tagalog.I visited the restaurant today with a friend who understands and speaks fluent Tagalog but is Chinese. The servers, Joey and Del, didn't suspect one bit that she understands Tagalog and continuously exchanged insulting and rude comments about us between themselves in Tagalog while masking their insults with wide smiles - while serving us.Good food but such service standards would make anyone lose an appetite

When i saw this place first, yesterday evening, it was almost empty but they could not seat me, because fully reserved tables. That was interesting, and so i went for lunch today. I must say, i can understand why its better to have a reservation for that place. The signature 4 or 8 pork belly's can also be ordered individually if you come alone, i had 3 (curry, misu, paprika) and they were excellent. They come with the usual korean kimchi ans sprouts and are prepared perfectly at your table. It is however not cheap, add one coke and you pay 45sgd for that, but if you come as a couple and have the 4 flavour menue with stew, i think the price will not feel so expensive anymore. Staff is attentive, friendly and knows their business. I can really recommend this place, as it sticks out over all the other korean restaurants in singapore
5
My 2nd time here and it didn't fail me again. Food was excellent, beef was superb (though pricey but worth it) and staff were very polite and enthusiastic. A meal for 4 (beef, pork belly, soup, ban chan) with rice wine set us back $200 but it was worth it coz the food items were very fresh. Definitely will visit again. :
5
It is no wonder why so many people say that you can get great food from all cultures in Singapore. I am Korean and as a Korean, we love PORK BELLIES and this restaurant specializes in Mangalitza bellies...yes, the very exquisite and rare Hungarian variety which I found out is only exclusive to Eight Korean BBQ.Their 8 Colour set comes complete with your choice of stew and free flow of side dishes. While it can get a bit smoky, their food more than makes up for the slight discomfort.If you're in Singapore and craving for Korean food, look no further, you will not be disappointed!!
