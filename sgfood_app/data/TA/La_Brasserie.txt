Came here for a couple hours and enjoyed some drinks. Good view and outdoor sitting area. Would recommend for casual drinks next to the bay
5
Service is very good. Order main dish came with bread with tuna & butter & end the meal dessert.
A good & quiet place.
4
This is a restaurant in the Fullerton Bay hotel. Friendly atmosphere and good service. Wine list is ok and the food to. You dont have a view of the bay. These guys are fast to.
4
Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was passable. No complaints. Although the staff could try to understand the difference between vegetarian and vegan, and not pass off their Risotto with eggs and cheese as vegan.

Located in the Fullerton hotel on marina bay this brasserie oozes ambience. Setting resembles a cross between Ritz with a fine dining flair and pricelist.We dropped in for a cocktail made to perfection and it was a good size.Bus, taxi or walk from MRTWe found on a very busy night where thousands swarmed the marina bay district, that this was not busy, perhaps due to limited view
4
Went here for a lunch date with my wife. The setting isn't as grand as we'd perhaps hoped for but was still very pleasant. The lunch menu was reasonably priced for such an establishment and the food quality was good. The chocolate mouse was particularly nice and exceeded our expectations. With lots of cherries lurking in the mouse. Service was also very good
4
They do a quite elaborate brunch on both Sat and Sun. There is a huge variety of things from salads to roast meats to sides to desserts. The roasted pork belly was the best we have ever had! The restaurant is lovely with high ceilings and lots of windows. Service was delightful. highly recommended
5
Absolutely great ambience. Service was amazing! Attentive staff named Win. VAwesome place if u looking for a romantic dinner too. Spectacular view of marina bay sands

Celebrated one of our yearly Christmas gathering and the place is a delight. Great service from the manager and the food is a stellar as well

I ordered Escargots from the menu .This is a dish I have been eating for over 50 years but in this restaurant ,it came with Tomatoes ,something I had not experienced ever before .When I asked to see the menu ,as presumably I had not read it correctly ,I discovered no mention was made of this additional ingredient .Neither ,clearly, had the waitstaff advised me of its inclusion .I have no problem with Chef choosing to prepare the dishes as s(he) wishes but when dealing with a standard dish,I do feel diners ought to be made aware of the change ,in advance .Either they may not like the new ingredient ,half of my problem,or they simply expected from the printed description ,something else .( I am tempted to wonder what the French Onion Soup would have been ,but no-one on our Party ordered that ) 
4
Like the food and the ambience. The staff provided a excellent service. We plan to go again for our next gathering.
5
The portion was substantial for the price we paid. Service was excellent. Had a great toy for my daughter that kept her occupied throughout.
4
Food was tasty and for the price, it was great value. Portion for starters was good as well, and the pork rillette that came with the bread was delicious
5
Pretty decent lunch set menu except for the 3 course set, we have to add a lot more extra $$ on the items we want.
4
Really nice place , quite intimate atmosphere, food selection good and well prepared , free flow of champagne , drinks , wine and soft drinks 140$ ++ - very good value for money , and we will come back
4
The staff were very friendly. They were very kind to offer a good table and remembered it's for our special occasion
5
This place is suitable for you to bring your prospective clients for a good meal to clinch a good deal
4
Food and service is good. Presentable to bring business clients along to dine. After renovation look nice. Only thing the hotline can sometimes be difficult to reach
5
We were impressed with the ambience, food and service.Plenty of choices for lunch. The bread was exceptionally tasty with the pate.Most importantly was the impeccable service by Mr Vijay. Extremely prompt, meticulous and a friendly chap. He just wants every guest to have a relaxing time over good food
4
Child friendly, was given was 3D puzzle for my kids which quieten them down. Food was value for $ due to the 1-for-1 main course we opted for the steak which was nice but the sauces could use more oompf as I like strong tastes. Complimentary dessert and cake for birthday. I lik
5
One of our Favourite restaurant at Raffles Place area. We had duck confit and rack of lamb, both done excellently and finished with profiteroles.
5
It's an great overall experience!! The food was fresh and delicious! most importantly the atmosphere was great with attentive service
5
As the names suggest La Brasserie serves great French Brasserie dishes. We chose the 3 course menu option which we found to be good value. Our Group had 2 different stakes and the Burger and they were all very good. We were celebrating a special occasion and they really provided great service. The decor and ambience is spectacular. Very high ceilings and very tastefully done. We would definitely go again
5
Many thanks to Kris and staff who worked so hard to make the evening special for our family's birthday celebration !The private room with the beautiful chandelier and high ceilings was so elegant, the onyx-like table was a modern twist. Set within ceiling-to-floor windows over-looking the water, it's hard to find another French restaurant with better ambience.The food was classic French, and we were not disappointed in the least.The beef cheeks were melt-in-the-mouth; the Wagyu burger was beautifully charred in a soft warm brioche bun. The steaks were well accompanied by a choice of 16 different flavoured-mustards - a surprising treat ! The lamb came in generous, perfectly done portions.We shared side dishes of truffle fries, peas with lardons and mashed potato, each of which was delicious. The portions were perfect.Late into the evening we stepped out through a side sliding door to enjoy the evening breeze and views of Marina Bay Sands in a private alfresco area. We even caught the laser show !Then we returned to our table to enjoy a chocolate birthday cake, compliments of the chef. We had such a lovely evening and were sorry to leave. We will be making plans to come back soon 
5
Forget all the bad reviews of this place! The earpiece-donning staff were polite and professional. The food was delicious as well -- we all enjoyed each and every bite of the exquisite food. They even provided us with a complimentary bread basket and dessert platter, to our surprise.We came for a birthday dinner and enjoyed the indulgent evening thoroughly.
3
Visited the restaurant to have a catch up with a relative on 30 Aug. Ambience was fantastic and the mood was right.We had the set dinner - the Steak & Frites and the Waygu Rump. It was a bit of a disappointment with the high rating and good reviews which I read. The steak was overcooked and so was tough to us (a bit of fighting with the meat may be good at times :-). Same for the Waygu rump and it has too much veins (making it tough to eat). During the ordering, would suggest that the restaurant could improve if the waiter could present the menu well. Maybe it was a busy night...service was not top notch. We were not presented with the type of knives or the different mustards that you could have.....Anyway, maybe I had expected too much from the reading of all the good reviews
5
A Saturday wouldn't be complete without a Saturday brunch. My family and I were blown away by the friendly service and wide selection of food and beverages, especially the free flow of famous Veuve Clicquot Champagne. It didn't stop coming and they always made sure our glasses were always poured and filled to the rim! The room was spacious and bright with 10 ft high windows from the ground to the ceiling. The salad bar and Bloody Mary presentation was set to perfection. The staff always ensured that the tables always looked pristine! The staff greeted us at the end of our stay and asked how our stay was with them. They were so generous and offered us a nice espresso martini on the house as we go there regularly. This champagne brunch is not one to be missed! The decor and atmosphere is elegant and the food is cooked to perfection. It is definitely a MUST GO TO, if you know anyone special that is visiting Singapore. Will definitely visit again

Wanted to test a French restaurant on Marina Bay.La Brasserie at Fullerton Bay Hotel is looking good. Unfortunatly my culinary experience was disappointing in spite of a good service. Food and wine were not at the experted level: tenderloin with nerves, French Burgundy wine poor.Very expensive
5
We had the 3 course set dinner. The food is amazing & we clean the whole plate. My friend chose the wagyu steak & the server brought out a whole tray of selections for mustard. Bread roll is warm when served & service was very attentive. It was a Birthday celebration & the restaurant thoughtfully presented a cake for us on the house. We will be coming back
4
Had a quick birthday lunch here - menu was as expected with all the French classics - execution was sincere rather than the increasingly common fusion / interpretation you get in Singapore. Perhaps the only disappointment was the dessert - neither Mousse or Creme Brulee was particularly impressive and I wondered at the training of the chef given the ease of getting these right in most french bistros
5
Simply wonderful experience. Enjoyed a good togetherness like home. Would come again definitely. Maybe New Year.
4
This is a great blend of modernism and classic finishes. The huge glass walls are broken up by 3 story drapes and chandeliers. The food is very good and the wait staff very professional. However the highlight is the private dining room down the end of the restaurant. Perfect for a group of 8-10 it is separate but not isolated and is perfectly proportioned. We had Sunday brunch (love the make your own Bloody Mary station) as well as a "normal" breakfast with all the trimmings.
2
Was there for dinner.Ordered the set menu.Service, plentiful but not sincere..like ' how is the food' and not hear the reply.Starter which is supposedly a tuna dish, came without the tuna Mixed order for main course (unforgivable for a supposed upmarket restaurant) Price.. Expensive. Don't ask for water, at $13, quite exorbitant in Singapore. Food.. OK but not exquisite. Poor presentation..so no pics to boastAmbience.. Good, though no of diners in flip flops and Bermudars!Overall..not worth i

great restaurant with wonderful services, put other restaurants at shame with their excellent service quality. tall ceiling makes the place really posh. setup is comfortable and cozy. food offered is delectable
5
I (and the bundle of joy nestled in my belly) was craving for a good French cuisine. Very happy to learn that there's a french restaurant in the hotel we were staying in so me and my husband went down for dinner. Instead of being served a good french food, we were served AMAZING french food. I couldn't decide between wanting a good boeuf or a hearty canard, so after my husband promised me that we would go back to eat here again prior to our departure (he wanted beef so he persuaded me to go with his choice) we went with the delicious cote de boeuf with a side of caramelized carrots, pommes puree for me and pommes pont neuf for Armand. They were absolutely delicious, so delicious that my husband and I said absolutely nothing during our meal (this is a rare occasion since I'm a huge chatter)! We were a very happy (and full) couple after the dinner. A few days later we went back for lunch. I (finally) had the Confit Canard and some of the delicious Pommes Pont Neuf while Armand had the Wagyu Steak & Truffle Fries. Highly recommended french restaurant
5
One of the best brunch's in Singapore. Free flow Verve Clicquot champagne made for a love relaxing 3 hours with a great selection of foods both ready prepared and that you could order. The service was ever smiling and helpful which you don't always get in Singapore brunches.So happy with the overall atmosphere and food and wines that we're coming back
3
Had a simple dinner at La Brasserie. Nice table and surroundings. It's a longish room but they made good use of it. Large windows, but not much of a view as it was mostly dark outside. Very nice bread. Staff was certainly nice, but I suspect they didn't have enough people to cope with guests all coming at virtually the same time that evening. My main issue is with the food. Seemed a little too salty to me. But I will go try again, perhaps at lunch.
5
When staying at the Fullerton Bay hotel for a few nights, we ate breakfast each morning in the Brasserie, and dinner one night. An experience not to be missed.Breakfast: Choice of breakfast items was outstanding, with something to suit everyone in the buffet; omelette station or from a range of cook to order items.Eggs Benedict is one of my favourites, but this was elevated to a new level with the bar now being set higher after I tasted the Eggs Benedict with salmon, which I didn't realize was a signature dish here (now I know why- awesome). Nothing was to much trouble for Vijay, Astrid and their team, who sought to make your total experience memorable.In fact, during conversation when they learned it was my birthday, my wife and I were treated to champagne and also a layer cake. Very impressive and not expected. Kicked off the day brilliantly. Vijay also took care of our dinner reservation for that evening and gave us some recommendations.Dinner was equally impressive. Although the set menu was tempting, we went a' la carter so that we could try some of our favourite foods, e.g French onion soup, prawns & chorizo and chateau Briand. Our starters were perfect. We were offered a range of steak knives to choose from, heightening expectations of what was to follow. The Chateau Briand was among the best I have eaten; and didn't really need a steak knife - fantastic meal!Very attentive staff who strive hard to anticipate and deliver exceptional service at every turn. Truly 5 star service! Can't wait to come back
5
The ambience is great for a Romantic evening dinner- the location itself offers window seatings with great views of the Marina Bay floating platform and skyline of the Marina Bay Area. Food is great and service from the staff was splendid too. Complimentary bread with butter before meal and after-meal petits are served
5
Celebrated my anniversary here and it was a pleasant experience with good steak. Servers could be more familiar with the card promos though..
4
Went there for a birthday celebration, would think that it is not really value for money. On the hindsight, the service was very good.
4
Place to enjoy the French cuisine. Good selection of red and white wines. Meat lovers will enjoy fully while vegetarians might find it difficult as the veg selection are very few. Beautifully located, both indoor and outdoor dining is possible
5
Choose to Dine in here because of the romantic atmosphere  to celebrate my partner birthday. Besides of the atmosphere the main course that we order Duck confit, Wagyu beef steak, was superb. And thanks to the Assistant Manager Mr.Kris for the good wine  combinations for our main course. He is very good in pairing the wine with the food that we ordered. At the end we did get a complimentary birthday cake for my partners. We had a wonderfull dinner. Will be back here soon.
4
Food is good & love their high ceiling, overall ambience so romantic. There's promo gg on at that period (1 for 1 main course) & selection is limited but all of us enjoyed
5
A big thank you to all at the La Brasserie for making my husband's birthday dinner (16 June 2017) wonderful. The service provided was impeccable and the food was delicious. Will recommend La Brasserie to anyone who would like to celebrate a special occasion as they really go the extra mile to make their guests feel welcomed. Will be back to dine there again
5
The Fullerton Bay Hotel's buffet breakfast is served here. A truly excellent buffet with both Western and Oriental options. Each morning there is a special egg dish on the buffet breakfast. One morning we had poached egg with fois gras and another we had scrambled eggs with truffles.The breakfast and lunch menus are excellent and reasonably priced
5
Attached to the Fullerton Bay Hotel, the restaurant has a wonderful night time ambience. We chose the $58.00 3 course meal deal. Starters was basically from the salad bar, however it was better than its sounds. Assorted breads were provided, something that is not always seen today in the dining experience. The Wagu Steak was very good, with a side of vegetables and your choice of numerous sauces that is prepared at the table. Simple but tasty deserts closed the evening nicely and we were not wanting for more, which is so often the case. Those wanting a greater selection, the Al a Carte menu looked terrific. The staff were very attentive and frankly made the evening that much more special. Thanks guys. We will visit again when next in Singapore
5
Rare quiet and good place for business lunches in the Fullerton Bay Area. Set menu was a bit pricey ($60 with add ons) but the escargot and duck confit I had were truly well made. Service is attentive, and environment is quiet enough to talk work without being awkwardly silent
5
What a lovely restaurant! Perfect for special occasions. Has a relaxing view of the Bay and easy access to the outdoors to enjoy the sunset. Duck rillette, escargots and oysters were great to start the meal. The Boston lobster capellini and mushroom tagliatelle were al dente and delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed the beef -cote de boeuf. Leave space for desserts - profiteroles and chocolate mousse delightful!Service was attentive and very helpful.
5
I had a lovely dinner at La Brasserie! The service was good but a little slow. But that's okay. My 6 and 9 year olds had a great time too. Even though I was skeptical about the fried food they ordered, it must be good enough for them finish their meal in half an hour. The ambience is romantic with dimly lit lights, quiet, restaurant has a high ceiling and has very spacious seating. One of the managers was honest in asking us not to order a certain beverage when we asked him about it. That's a plus point and is most appreciated. I had a huge piece of complimentary cake to end the evening. I see a lot of customers ordering the oysters on buffet. Looks really good too. Maybe I will go back some other time if they still have that on promotion. The portion of the food was huge. And the quality amazing! Thank you for a great evening

I enjoyed my dinner together with my friend last night.The manager and staff are very accommodating and attentive which makes us feel comfortable and happy.The food are in average.We had a great dinner!!!!!

We came here for our wedding anniversary before heading up to the Lantern roof top bar for drinks. We tried the 3 course set dinner, and had the lobsters & scallops carpaccio, escargots, French onion soups, entrecôte beef. For dessert we had the creme brûlée and soufflé. The service could be improved as we were served with the soup and there was no soup spoon. We were just waiting for them to realized the missing utensils, but no reaction after 5 mins we had to call for the spoons. The food was ok, but there are better FRENCH restaurants with better service aroun
5
We had set dinner here for a birthday celebration. The ambience is nice and I can't help but praise the food quality and quantity which was fantastic. The 3 course set dinner was like $58++ and we replaced the appetizer with 1/2 dozen of fresh oysters with only $12 top up. Wine was 1 for 1 throughout the evening. Highly recommended for great dinner at super value. Will be back for sure.
3
The only reason I would not go lower on the rating is the good kitchen. This was good. We loved the tartare and Lam! The service was just awful for this kind of restaurant and price. We had to call waiters several times for everything even to top up wine! If you pay 200SGD per person you expect more than this mediocre approach.
5
Came here as a couple's dinner. Very nice ambiance with delicious french cuisine. Highly recommend the oyster buffet and their lobster bouillabaisse. Very surprised at how generous the portions were. The waiters and waitresses were very warm and very professional. 5 star service here.Also, try and get a free parking voucher if you dine here above a certain amount (I think it was above SGD 200
3
We had breakfast this morning. The buffet was a good spread and the foods were delicious. On the side we ordered French toast and eggs benedict. All very nice . However, service was not as good expected. Clearing the dirty plates was never happened as expected in a buffet restaurant, so we need to eat next to it. Happened to the table next to us also. We really missed the good service at this restaurant.
5
Been there a few times. Sometimes just for drinks, their happy hours are excellent value. Food is also very good. The ambience of this restaurant, with high roof and classic decor is great. That plus the friendly and courteous service will make you very happy indeed.Last visit was a couple of weeks back. Had the house pour French red which was excellent, unlike most house pours. Priced very reasonably too. It is also available by 'carafe' which is again a damn good deal. Had the set dinner but upgraded the main. The cod fish was a good size portion cooked to perfection with natural flavor and taste which is what I like about this place. Even better was the dessert - served with complimentary chocolates and mini cakes. Big, be careful if you are watching your weight! Water glass was refilled all the time by the attentive waitress, maitre'd dropping by often to inquire. As it was raining heavily after the meal they even offered an umbrella which I did not take. Reasonable price, great setting, good service, what more can we ask for?
4
Selected the restaurant for its convenient location and nice ambience. The set menu offered good variety for varying tastes but we decided to go with the Chinese-French set. The Seabass was done very nicely and presentation also very impressive. The dessert offering a blend of Chinese during lunar new year was eye-catching and colorful. Overall, it was a good lunch but the kitchen did fall behind midway through our meal. So we had to rush our client towards the end.
4
Dear La brasserie,Thank you for the awesome service and we were well taken care.I would like to take this compliment to say a big thank you to Mr Arjen and Ismail and of course the rest of the staffs.The foods was awesome, the dessert was delicious! Lastly, thanks to Mr Robert the hotel manager for this arrangement and we are satisfied and happy about it.Thank you so much!
3
The included buffet breakfast was served here. Although the choices were plentiful and beautifully presented, the food was rather average. We preferred to eat dinner and tea in the other of the hotels restaurants
4
I was invited to evening dinner at La Brasserie with local colleagues on the last evening of my recent business trip to Singapore. We had a nice table overlooking the water and we got settled in to a French style brasserie type evening meal. The menu looked very sophisticated and... French. I went for the set menu with "escargots" followed by the "entrecot et frites" and finishing with profiteroles! In reality the snails were OK - served on a dish with 6 wells rather than in their shells. The steak and chips was also OK if rather tepid. To be honest we should have complained and asked them to serve the food at a normal hot temperature but all of us were just too polite. There were no complaints about the delicious profiteroles. I don't recall the French wine served with the meal, but it was certainly very nice. I loved the atmosphere, the company and the effort put into trying to emulate a true French dining experience just a few kilometres away from the equator
3
A solid offering in a Fullerton Bay Hotel with some (limited) view to the water and bay. A traditional Brasserie style menu offering good choice and bar drinks.Overall we all enjoyed the food but the service was very slow at times and we had to ask twice to remind folk about desert and coffees. The bill paying was not a pleasant experience as on did not feel at all to be a valued customer.
5
My husband took me to La Brasserie two weeks ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was our first time to dine here and I'm happy to share that all the good things I've read about it are absolutely true and more! La Brasserie is gorgeous with it's high ceiling and elegant interiors. It's actually pretty romantic inside and it's right by the marina so some seats would have the view of the water. The staff are incredibly sweet and service-oriented. We had a little chat with Martin and the restaurant manager who's name escaped me at the moment but he's Dutch and I remember him saying he has the same name as one of the Dutch football players (so sorry). They're both very lovely people and we had fun exchanging pleasantries with them. The food is exquisite, like really exquisite! We ordered bouillabaisse, salmon, oysters, etc and they were all exceptionally good - especially the bouillabaisse. The portion is more than sufficient for anyone with normal-sized appetite. For dessert, we had creme brulée and chocolate lava cake which were both intensely rich and decadent! We had such an incredible dining experience I wouldn't mind going back one or two times more.:
3
Was invited for a farewell brunch bash. Heard a lot of good things about this place so I was excited to try it out. Location was perfect of course being right beside the bay and service was excellent except for this one waiter that couldn't understand my singaporean English or my friend's Texan accent ; p. Was looking for the wow but was kinda disappointed. I didn't mind the condensed menu if it was for better quality food. Roast beef and wagyu beef burger were probably the highlight but all others (pork belly, dessert, cheese platter and wine) were just not befitting the location and setting. It was also weird to see Nasi Goreng on the menu. Overall a good experience because of the location, setting and service but I think this experience could have been so much better.
5
My family dined at La Brasserie last night in celebration of my wife's birthday. We were really impressed by the ambience and setting of the restaurant. A seemingly colonial setting, with a stunning view of the city landscape, we knew we were in for an enjoyable dining experience. For starters, we ordered a fruzee salad, truffle fries and several of the soups. The starters met our expectations and the bread basket that came with the starters complemented with the starters well. Then came our main courses, whereby we ordered the cod fish, grilled fish of the day and duck confit. The cod fish was the best main dish of the evening! A generous serving portion, the fish was succulent and fresh, got us wanting for more after every bite. The risotto that came with me earned our thumbs up as well.More importantly, our dinner was accompanied by hosts and servers who were extremely welcoming, thoughtful and courteous. They were really professional and yearned to make sure that we enjoyed the evening to the fullest. A special shout out goes to Mr Martin and Ms Charisma, who went the extra mile to make our dining experience a memorable one! We were really impressed by their excellent service and we believe that they are valuable assets of La Brasserie! The evening ended off with some delicious petite desserts (chocolates, macarons, kueh lapis) and a complimentary birthday cake for my wife, who of course had a delightful evening! Keep it up, La Brasserie and we will definitely be back for more
5
Beautiful restaurant great food & service. I had the chateaubriand which was so beautiful & tender. Good old fashioned service white tablecloths silver service & extensive wine menu.Would definitely recommend for a special occasion. Mid -high price bill as no entree due to main meals quite big. Banquette bench seating was our choice, found tables for 2 very close to other couples 
4
Breakfast great variety as expected in a top Asian hotel with a chef to cook Omelettes. Asian options were sometimes excellent and sometimes disappointing. Service excellent and friendly. dinner - casual to formal options but we were disappointed with a tastelsss burger. Would not eat there for dinner again as plenty of other options including their top class Chinese restauarnt which was fully booked
3
Fourth time to dine in this restaurant; all three previous times when it was called Clifford Pier. This time, the menu seemed less inspired, and waitstaff did not seem as well trained as I remember them to be.For restaurant week 2016, the complementary basket of bread is tasteless, and the egg (sous vide) and pumpkin soup were average. Fortunately, the main course of salmon is cooked perfectly so that the meat was moist and whatever seasonings were used did not over the natural flavour of the cold water fish. Panna cotta and petit fours were served as desserts, accompanied by tea and coffee. The perfect texture of the panna cotta was ruined by the cloyingly sugary syrup of the canned cherry (or berry) that was topped onto it (passion fruit would've provided a better balance); worse, the petit fours were forgettable. The Chardonnay (thank God!) was crisp and refreshing.The restaurant offers a really charming view of the waters. Its high ceilings and elegant furnishings carry so much class. Besides, the Fullerton Bay Hotel is a majestic place to be-- the Landing Point and the Lantern Bar are places we visit and recommend to friends time and again. I truly hope this restaurant picks up its game soon

I have visited La Brasserie on more than quite a few occasions over the past few years and the experience had always been a pleasure. Located within Fullerton Bay Hotel, diners at La Brasserie get to enjoy quite a spectacular view of Singapore Marina Bay front. Although one does not get the Marina Bay Sands view, diners do get to see the impressive The Sail@Marina Bay towering over the skyline.During my latest visit, I decided to try out their 3-course set dinner. For appetizer, I had half a dozen escargot, baked with garlic and parsley butter. For the main course, there were 3 options. But I selected none of them, instead opting to pay an extra S$18/- for an upgrade to the roasted cod, a decision well made! For dessert, I opted for the creme brulee.Personally, I found the escargots and creme brulee to be good, but not exceptional. The outstanding dish of the evening was without doubt the roasted cod. The fish was so soft and tender, it almost literally melted in the mouth!A special mention ought to go to Martin, the manager who remembered us as returned patron even though our visits were not actually not that frequent, and Emma who were friendly and super efficient in taking care of the tables!We will certainly be back
5
Celebrating my wife 50th with the family at la brasserie @ Fullerton bay hotel With free flow of Moët it is arguably one of the best possible places to go. Very friendly and attentive staff , food selection IS more than enough to make all palate happy and it won't burn a big hole in your wallet Highly recommended for a perfect birthday outing
4
Our first visit in August 2016 left a very bad taste in our mouths. We were invited back to the restaurant by Naveen, the assistant F&B manager for another meal. Like before, we went on a weekday evening and were seated promptly at a quiet table. Both the assistant F&B manager and the hotel manager dropped by to say hi. We were served exclusively by the restaurant manager (I presume) the entire night. Went with his food recommendations and it came warm/hot with reasonable waiting time. Although we were not asked how we'd like the beef done, the meat was cooked just right and very soft. The onion soup was also split into two portions which made sharing easier. This time round, the issues/unhappiness we encountered during our previous visit did not resurface
5
I've visited twice. The first time I was blown away by the excellent service. Both the wait staff and the chef were very accommodating of my dietary limitations due to coeliac disease. The food was excellent.
5
On a selfish note, i do not wish to give this restaurant 5 * .... but given that i am reaching 80k on my readership on TA, i feel the need to be honest - and i do love what this place has to offer. This is my 4th visit to La Brasserie, but my 1st Sunday Brunch. And this is an advance birthday celebration for myself. Price wise, at $138++ with VC Champagne, cocktails and selected wine, it is competitive with what the other big boys are offering. Food is fresh, you will get your usual offering of oyster, lobster, prawns. There is the meat section with beef,lamb,chicken and roast pork... etc. There is also a bloody mary counter which is free for all to access, and you will get a nice mix of flavored vodka concocted to your preference ( available to those that decides to go with the usual brunch package at $98++). You will get a welcome drink (apple juice + champagne) at the door to kick start your sunday brunch. Personally, i like the way that they keep the tables spaced out pretty reasonably. Waitering staff are a bit pushy on the champagne package thou. But nonetheless, i opted for the package since it is for my birthday. The brunch comes with a list of ala carte dishes to choose from and my favorite is the fried dory and chicken rice! The waygu is too tough and laksa is too watery. Linguine lobster pasta is not too bad. Oh yes, and the Fullerton bears made an entrance and they were perfect for picture moments! The last bit where the staff forgotten about the cake was a bit of a letdown, but nothing major. Overall my friends and i agreed that the place is cosy, quality food with reasonable pricing & lastly, my friend really enjoyed the cosmopolitan that one of the managers claimed to have mixed it himself - well done!
5
It is rare to find saturday brunch in Singapore but here it is, La Brasserie has it nailed.Featuring a comprehensive DIY bloody mary cocktail station, anyone would be spoilt for choice when it comes to mix and matches for your drink. I was thrilled to have the fun in creating my own concoction.The savoury food were delicious, especially the roast chicken which had a very flavorful texture. The made to order item consists of egg dishes and main courses. You would seriously get full from all these. Not to mention service was efficient, with my champagne never touching the base of the glass
3
Visited for lunch. Lovely environment with a view over the Harbour. The tables are well spaced out and allow for conversation. They have a good set menu but we opted to have the steak and fries. My steak was quite tough and very disappointing - I thought they would have used a better cut of meat. The macaroons and chocolates at the end of the meal were great.
5
Excellent Champagne Brunch on a Sunday. Fantastic venue and attentive staff. Good value compared to the rest of the big hitters of Singapore like Equinox, Ritz Carlton, Mezzanine etc. The choice is obviously not quite as extensive but you choose the main course from the menu and they are excellent

Located in the waterfront of Singapore's Financial Centre, the restaurant is ideal if you look to enjoy both the ambience and experience of french dining. When we arrive at 12pm there are only 2 tables occupied, so it is peaceful and quiet.Given that it is not crowded on a weekday lunch, service is attentive with staff asking if everything is ok. Food is acceptable for restaurant standard

Dine here if you want to have your evening ruined. We had dessert and movie plans but had to cancel because of the slow service. Made reservations via Chope website but the waitress couldn't find it. No issue. There were a few empty tables and we were seated promptly, that's when the nightmare started.On a weekday night, with empty tables, our food took almost AN HOUR to arrive. I notified the waitress after 30mins of waiting and she said she'll check, but I never heard back. There was no apology, explanation or compensation for the delay. Just two words: "I'll check" and "It's coming".When the food finally came, the sea bass tasted like it was left outside for a long time. It wasn't warm or hot. The food was very average, like heartland mall restaurant kind of average. Definitely NOT what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.The manager came over as we were paying and according to him, it usually takes 25 to 30mins for the food to be served after the starters. Well, we did not order starters. Also, I have never waited more than 20mins for food in a hotel. We ended up going somewhere else for a second dinner because this experience left an unpleasant taste in our mouths

The Saturday brunch is good value for money. We went with a bunch of friends and had a great 3-4 hours. The buffet spread is decent, and the free flow wines and beers makes it a great deal. Service was good too, they topped up the beverages regularly. They even have an ala-carte menu for you to choose your main course from. I will go back

Had a delightful dinner here with my husband . I chose the steak recommended by the waiter and it was simply outstanding . My husband had a vegetarian option which was also nice. But the steak was the standout. We wanted a basic salad , not on the menu and they made one up for us . We had eaten so much Chinese cuisine while in Singapore it was nice to have a change. Could highly recommend this restaurant . Will certainly return next time .
1
I was made to wait 1.5 hours for my food,past 9.30pm, only to be informed that there was some miscommunication in the kitchen and it won't be coming. Bad kitchen management. Won't come back again

I went there last weekend with my husband and seven other friends to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We’ve been here on several occasions and have enjoyed it every other time. The setting, ambience and service is usually great. However, to say it was a let down this time is an understatement. Unfortunately it fell very short of our expectations. Had it not been for our previous experiences, I would have awarded this restaurant a ‘terrible’ rating. Firstly, we found that the food from the buffet ran out and was not replenished quickly, if at all. I had to stand around waiting for bread for quite some time and eventually had to request some. After seeing me waiting for a long time, one of the waiters kindly suggested I sit down and he would bring it to me, which he did. Unfortunately when he brought it, it was warm on the outside and still rather frozen in the middle. The cheese platter also ran out very early on and was not filled up again. Our waiter was quite unfriendly and made us feel like we were an inconvenience to him. We actually had to ask him to take our food orders on both occasions. I requested the eggs from my first course be fully cooked through. When I cut into the eggs the yokes were both runny so I asked our waiter again to have fully cooked-through eggs. He started to debate what I’d initially asked for implying that I hadn’t made it clear that I wanted the eggs cooked all the way through. It wasn’t until my husband pointed out that I was pregnant and cannot eat runny eggs that the waiter took the plate away. The waiter presented us with a single bill at the end without asking us how we would like to pay it. When we asked for individual bills, he asked us if we wouldn’t just like to divide it between our nine guests. This really wasn’t acceptable as we all had different options and left us feeling quite uncomfortable in front of our friends. Again, we had to ask him if we were able to order tea and coffee as this was not offered to us as it has been on previous occasions. He seemed rather put out by this request. Overall, Saturday’s brunch was a great disappointment. Had it been our first time there, I’m certain we would not come back. As it is, I would seriously question whether it’s worth returning

We have eaten lunch there before and standard was good. However dinner on Sunday evening was not very good at all. My wife had the rack of lamb which was hard to believe when it was served (over cooked and terribly presented). I had the steak which was badly undercooked with a truffle sauce on it that I didn't request. Overall we were not charged for any of the food. It is a pity because overall the Fullerton Bay hotel is a first rate establishment.
2
A great setting with high sealings and beautiful decoration, makes a nice scene and unfortunately in this case sets expectations to a level where the kitchen can't deliver... Went here twice, the first time for a mediocre weekend brunch 5-6 months ago, where the selection left much to be desired. The second time was a friend's birthday party this past weekend, where the set dinner was super disappointing! Had a very sweet French onion soup with very little cheese, then 4 (too) small slices of entrecôte steak, that was cold and served with bleak fries! I normally have a healthy appetite and have seldom left half my dish behind, but that night I had to go for supper on the way back from dinner... Unfortunately, the duck confit that others from the same party had was left half finished as well, and the poor host of our party even asked the waiters "where the potato side dish" for the confit was hidden...

I was at the restaurant for a wedding dinner. The staff were very attentive to the guests' needs and the food quality was quite good! Really love the scenic view too
5
This was our second time to experience the Sunday free flow champagne brunch which is very good value for money. Staff are attentive and friendly and our one year old grandson liked the Teddy Bear mascot coming to greet each table. Free flow champagne and some interesting shots are part of the deal. Food is mainly very good seafood and some roasts but you can also order a main course off the menu. After a few glasses of champagne the food choice is not a problem and the buffet is very tasty with make your own Bloody Mary. A very enjoyable couple of hours!
4
Nice restaurant with very high ceiling. Great place to chat with special friends without having to raise or lower voices. Food will be great if it is a little less saucy and sweet though.
4
We only had breakfast at la Brasserie but it is a very good place for that. A large hot and cold buffet with the chef on hand for your made to order eggs etc. Efficient and welcoming staff who are sure to remember you
4
We have been frequenting this restaurant mainly for its Saturday brunch since 2013. The ambience, the view of Marina Bay and music from the jazz duo is just right to make one feel that this is going to be a great weekend. We like it that part of the meal is buffet-style and part-served. There are no large, noisy crowds like most hotel buffets though reservations are recommended as the restaurant has been fully booked everytime we've been there. At a recent brunch, we had our usual package of free-flow of wine and juices at $99++. There is a buffet of hot and cold appetizers, and a live station offering roast pork - juicy and tender with the tastiest crackling, chicken (tasty though a bit boring) and beef (excellent!). The dessert selection is also a buffet. The crepe with choice of toppings is highly recommended. In addition to the buffet, you can choose eggs done in four various ways and a separate small menu for the main course, also a choice of five items. The egg items we ordered did not disappoint but after the helpings of the roasts from the buffet, we were quite happily stuffed. Likewise for the mains. We ordered the cod (perfectly prepared) and the wagyu burger (well seasoned and the onion relish was great!). Again, we could not finish our servings though they were by no means large plates. I must mention that they also have a Bloody Mary buffet counter, just what every respectable brunch needs to kick-start the feasting. There is a full array of condiments to make this drink as special as you want it to be. This might be the best part of the brunch actually!The service has been excellent at every visit though I must add that the cashier frequently has to be reminded of credit card offers.No doubt we're going to keep coming back for more

Just walked into the restaurant without reservation. The restaurant's interior is very beautiful. Brunch was served, which I didn't want to participate in. Was offered set menus instead and was not disappointed. Had an excellent 3 course set lunch for a very moderate price that even included coffee and wonderful macaroons. The service was extremely good, friendly and helpful which has rounded up a great lunch experience. Would definitely return
4
Delightful restaurant setting and the food is good. Service here is excellent, the staff, friendly professional and helpful
5
We weren't expecting much as we thought this would be another adequate, but dull, hotel restaurant. We were very pleasantly surprised to find excellent food and service (although with the benefit of hindsight the wagyu burger with foie gras, which was delicious, wasn't necessarily a wise choice). A reasonably buzzy atmosphere, but probably more hotel than independent restaurant.Slightly odd that a restaurant right on Marina Bay actually had no view of it unless you were in the private dining room at the end. A minor quibble for a Singapore resident, but perhaps more significant for a short term visitor
3
I was here 2 years ago, and had griped about the quality of the food. Looks like things haven't changed much, and little has improved.Came here for lunch again with some colleagues, and although service started out great, it gradually turned bad about midway through our meal.It's not like any of the staff were rude or anything, but it's just the speed of the serving was absolutely atrocious. We all had to wait much longer than acceptable, for each of our courses to be served, regardless of what we had ordered. I'm pretty sure we were left waiting for our final course for at least 30 minutes, before we decided to ask them about it. If we hadn't asked them for it, God knows it might have taken even longer for the food to finally appear.Having said that, the food wasn't tasty either, which is the same verdict as my last review. My pasta was average, and the dessert was horrendous. Not only did it look ugly, it tasted bad too.Whether it's called The Clifford, as it was once known, or La Brasserie, as it's known now, this place is turning into one of those overstated, posh restaurants that offer little else other than its brand-name
5
The set menu was great and covers all the french classics - good value, good food, beautiful dining room and attentive service - can't ask for more
2
A recent lunch at La Brasserie was rather disappointing. Starting with the beef carpaccio and mushroom soup, every dish was somewhat insipid and lacked any soul. The fish was completely tasteless and felt quite unfresh. I hope this does not happen often at the restaurant, but there was an actual live bird flying overhead throughout lunch. Felt a bit unsanitary as we could have had bird droppings on our food at any time
4
This is a restaurant set within the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The overall atmosphere was relaxed but not casual. The friendliness and warmth of the staff makes you comfortable, unlike what most of us would typically perceived of a French restaurant. We ordered 1/2 a dozen of escargots and I had a main serving of steak tartare. The pricing are right, slightly mid-upper pricing, but I recommend this for a night out with a good or special friends. The serving is good, and this should ease the worry of not having enough as to fill our stomachs at french cuisine. Restaurant's decoration is chic European classic, nothing too daunting, and easy for one to ease into the environment and make the meal enjoyable
4
The ambience of this restaurant is really romantic. We received excellent service from a staff named Ting Yan. She's is friendly, meticulous and thoughtful. We enjoyed our dinner greatly because of her recommendation and service.
5
Wonderful continental food and very romantic setting. Definitely suited for special occasion celebration.
2
We celebrated my mum's birthday at probably one of the most disappointing restaurant. With the kind of prices at Fullerton Bay Hotel you would expect tasty and awesome food.But the food took one hour and when our main courses were served they were all cold. When the manager asked how was everything, I gave my honest feedback and said the food came out all cold and waited for one hour, he kept silent for a good 8 seconds ( probably didn't expect negative comments or don't know how to handle negative comments ) and ended off by saying " will feedback to the chef " After that it was nothing , no apologizes or no other things offered ( not that I was expecting any) but usually restaurants that dare to charge high prices usually have an awesome way to handle negative feedback.Anyway last time dinning there.Long wait / bad food / cold food.

When it is hot outside you like the cool yet tastfully, warmly decorated atmosphere in the Fullerton Bay Brasserie. The competence, warm friendliness and charm of the personal contributes to your wellbeing. The well coached waitresses of Mr Blom surprise you every time with their warm attention. The food and wines are luxurious, well presented and of first quality. The chef and his team convince with their modern international cuisine. We had a Frisee salad followed by surf and turf with a fine filet mignion and half a lobster respectively a lobster salad followed by a grilled sea bass. Very tastful dressings and delicat sauces gave the dishes a fine frame. Singapore in gneral is quite a expensive, but the quality of the entire diner was worth the price. The breakfasts are equally remarkable in the Brassserie, early morning sunshines of the waitresses, like that of Ida enlighten all your day. We will be back
5
Service was prompt and we got a stalk of rose, paper fan, & photo frame with our picture because it's Valentine's Day weekend!
3
Location is great, ambiance and interior design are nice and give a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Staff is friendly, swift and professional. Unfortunately and disappointingly, the food is average, not what you would expect for such a place and the prices. It's good enough for business dinner, when the talking is more important than the meals
4
Food was okay. Staff, ambience and view made up for the lack of quality in food. Maybe will return again for lunch
5
when we came for dinner we had a group of 6 so we had a small problem finding a table but the staff kindly showed us all the available tables when the food came it was absolutely amazing including desert will come back
4
We chose La Brasserie to celebrate a momentous family occasion and we were definitely not disappointed. Everything from the food, setting to the service was great. It's the second time we are coming back to this place and definitely we will be coming back again! The cod is definitely a winner! Keep it up La Brasserie
5
A well-kept secret is the Sunday brunch at Le Brasserie at the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore. From 12 noon-3pm you can enjoy a magnificent buffet smorgasbord, as well as choose a main course from the a la carte menu. Also if you choose, you can have the champagne drinks package which gives you free-flowing champagne for the entire length of your brunch (on the day we went it was Veuve!) The setting is gorgeous, right on the water in a beautifully decorated room with very attentive staff who never let you see the bottom of your glass! We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and the staff took a photo of us and presented it to us on leaving, as well as a special dessert. If you're after a special lunch in Singapore, this is the place
5
When we stay at the Fullerton Bay, we love the Breakfast at The Brasserie - a wide variety of foods, all delicious. Service is superb - a special experience always
4
We arrived shortly before the restaurant was closing, but the waiter accommodated us with a lovely table, bayside, outdoors. We were interested in a light meal as we had just arrived from the long day of flying in from Miami (via Frankfurt-Singapore). We selected a four appetizers, and red wine by the glass. The food was EXCELLENT, and perfectly suited our intents. The wine was spot on, and the waiter provided a generous pour. While resting between courses the restaurant manager came out to chat with us and after a while treated us to another glass of wine. The waiter and the manager were both long time restaurant professionals with international experience and training. Both relocated to Singapore many years ago and have settled down with Singaporean wives. Their kind attention, and the balmy weather, the French ambiance, wonderful food made the evening just perfect. Since we were guests at the Fullerton Bay Marina Hotel it was a few short steps to our elevator and to our room. Thank you staff of La Brasserie

I've enjoyed this place for brunch on more occasions that I visited than not, but given the standard of the venue, and the price, it really does not have the option to vary that much.Arguably the finest Bloody Mary bar in Singapore, only slightly annoying on a busy day when novices will stand in front of the impressive array of ingredients and just stare for a few moments, but mostly more amusing.Not a large room for brunch, more intimate in comparison to the other 5* options on the island. The standard of food is consistently high, with a great seafood bar, but I remain cautious about the inconsistency with the staff. When left waiting at the carving station whist chef was too preoccupied with a pasta dish to even inform me how long I might be standing there, and this after my lamb shank was cancelled quite early in service, due one presumes to management issues in the kitchen.I summary, one of my favourite brunch spots, but don't get your hopes up on a busy weekend, the staff does tend to crack under pressure
2
Not a bad place but beware of what food they bring you. We asked for some fries for my gf's 3 year old and ended up with truffle fries. Rather odd selection for a child which was clearly not enjoyed.
4
Had a separate room for a group lunch. Hotel and the room simply beautiful. Service was try hard but one bip off perfect, but still very good. Food was really nice, great produce cooked fantastically. Highly recommend
5
The waiters and waitresses are very attentive to us, and the food were really yummy! Love the steak! Love the ambiance!
4
Ideal place for a special occasion, good list of wines, i went here for dinner around 8pm though its easy to find if you are going first time you might have to walk a little as its inside bay hotel after the elevator. Very easy to go back to raffles mrt and easy to get cabs from here. Its located at the riverside with views of marina bay sands on the other side..the lights are amazing at night though i still prefer lantern which is on the roof la brasserie has my likeness for its excellent service and hospitality by the staff very friendly and humorous. My tip is you choose a table near the river side at the back of the hotel if u sit infront the view will be blocked by customs house. Food is good but deserts are not that great. I would recommend hotel to add candle light on all tables at night as the current lighting is bit dull

Needed a place to go for a Saturday brunch. Not too many options in Singapore in this regard. The mix of a la carte orders and self serve buffet was nice. Service was hit or miss with the crepe chef missing for a while (the manager eventually found him) and drinks orders (as we are non-drinkers) needing to be repeated a few times. The multiple garnishes and sauces available at the buffet table is nice and unique. The room got quite warm as it is all glass and the air conditioning seemed to be weak (the staff handed out fans to the ladies so it must be a common issue). The old Clifford Pier building is a wonderful conversion
2
I was so disappointed that I felt compelled to write my first review. Went for a birthday dinner as a family of four.  Ambience: elegant, high-ceilings. Tables far enough apart.  Service: Alarmingly bad. Received menus but no wine list. Had to ask for the wine list from two servers before receiving it. Same with the bill, which contained an error so the process of trying to pay for our meal was painfully time consuming-more excruciating after a very long wait for dessert. Then we had to remind them of our coffee order, which ended up arriving after we were done. Being served water was another challenge, and the list goes on.  Food: generally ok but duck confit overly dry and bouillabaisse watery. Bread was wonderful.  I expected better from Fullerton Bay and I certainly won't go back. To think I chose this restaurant over another one because the other one had bad reviews on service and I hadn't wanted to put up with bad service for a nice birthday meal
5
We stopped for a dinner after wandering in the hotel lobby. The atmosphere is as you have travel 100 years in time to old Singapore.We had a cream mushroom soup for starter. It was perfect. For main course we had mussels in Thai sauce which were very fresh with delicate taste, simply excellent. Other main course was a "chateaubrian" 300 gr. which was tender and made in perfection. Side dishes were French potato purée which was creamy but just the right texture and asparagus in hollandes sauce which was crispy and very delicious. For desert we took a dreamy creme brûlée. Also a selection of home made cookies and chocolate were a perfect finish for an extra ordinary dinner. Service was prompt with a smile just as you would expect such a high quality restaurant. Prices are reasonable, worth it. DONT MISS THIS EXPERIENCE (!)
5
My brother and I just had dinner there this evening for Steak Frites and it was great. The steak was superb and the truffle fries were delicious. We started off with a steak tartare and ended the meal with profiteroles. I have to admit, one of the best parts of the meal was the service! The servers were very friendly and fun to talk to, which for Singapore is extremely rare. I will definitely be a regular here as the food was great, the service was amazing, and the atmosphere is incredible
3
Note this use to be called the Clifford so it is hard to find a review under this name. This is a very lovely and chic restaurant with great ambiance. We came on a Tuesday night and it was quite full. The service was very attentive - until the end of the meal when we tried to order other items and were ignored. We ordered the 3 course set menu. Dinner for two came to about $240 Singapore dollars which we thought pricey for what we had
4
*Note: Clifford Restaurant has been re-branded as La BrasserieTried out La Brasserie during Restaurant week Singapore, Oct 26 - Oct 30 2015 and I am glad I did. Located at the swanky Fullerton Bay Hotel (The newer hotel at Customs House, Not to be confused with the older Fullerton Hotel ), La Brasserie is almost old skool elegance with mood lighting, salons, servers in full Maitre D uniforms, and a competent restaurant manager that provides a light but sometimes aloof touch to the service. The food is excellent as well, having had the Salmon Scallops Carpaccio as starters, Beef Ribs A La Provencal for the Main dish and a decadent caramel crispy chocolate cake for dessert. I highly recommend the Beef Ribs by the way should it ever surface on the regular menu. All in all, its a good 3-course dinner to write home about for the fixed price of $55++. I don't know what is the usual price for the dishes apart from Restaurant Week Fixed Price menu but I imagine it would match the lofty heights of the restaurant ceiling. Still, this would be an excellent place for a good business meal to clinch deals, or a nice romantic date for that special person. They also possess a rare and small private room in a French cuisine restaurant (Outside of Chinese restaurants that is) that can probably only fit maximum 6 people comfortably. I would give this 4 stars only because I feel sometimes the service although good, can sometimes be aloof. Also I assume this would be the fine-dining range for the price conscious
5
I had breakfast on Oct. 20 and 21. The buffet had everything I could want including omelets made to order and brought to the table. I particularly enjoyed the smoked salmon, yogurt, fresh fruit juices, and coffee. At the table there were a few items which could be ordered. The French toast was very good as was the waffle.The service was extremely good and I enjoyed the lovely decor.I would give this restaurant a 10 out of 10 and will surely go there again when I next visit Singapore.The cost was only S$38 per person plus service charge and GST so I feel this was very good value for money
5
Awesome food quality and service :D a great dining experience so would recommend foodies to head over
5
Although this is an expensive hotel, the lunch special is excellent value and delicious. The setting is sublime and well worth experiencing

We were there for a birthday and had their Sunday Champagne Brunch buffet which we thought was a great experience and plan to make it a yearly affair for our anniversary. Stepping into the restaurant, we were greeted with warm welcoming decor, great use of space and a great view. We felt very relaxed and and with the restaurant being smaller than most brunch places, it didn't feel over-crowded and noisy, the live 2 piece band also helped. Additional plus point was an outdoor deck to enjoy your alcohol along with the view! Food was of a good international variety. Lobsters & fresh oysters were the highlight of the seafood section but the desserts were a disappointment given Fullerton's typical standard in desserts. What was fun was that they included a buffet bar to make your own bloody marys! Apart from the usual buffet spread, they also went an extra mile to serve main courses with a mix of local to western options prepared with premium ingredients which were tasty. Service was professional, prompt and friendly and our glasses were never left empty, kudos to their attentiveness. As we mentioned we were celebrating a birthday, they even threw in a birthday cake that was better than their dessert line. Loved the whole experience
4
A wonderful building with excellent views over the Marina Bay, great service, good value food although a somewhat limited menu, the only downside was the acceptance of a very poor dress code from the locals ( thongs and shorts are acceptable), also it is unfortunate they let children run amock! but otherwise well worth a visit
4
Dinner Restaurant: I like the place.....high ceiling and windows provide great views.Service: Above average....but not excellent.Food: The oysters are great at this place. The steaks were good.Value for money: Good for the quality of food I think it is reasonably prices.Overall: I have eaten here many times, and what surprised me were the errors the establishment made. The restaurant had 5-6 tables filled, so it most definitely wasn't a busy dinner service, yet there were multiple lapses in the service.1) They forgot our drinks....but the staff did spot the error and apologised after our first course was over.2) They forgot a side order....Truffle Fries to go along with the steak never showed up....ever3) They forgot our sauces for the steak....wowNot sure what was going on behind the scenes but I'm really surprised by the mistakes when the restaurant wasn't even busy. Perhaps the kitchen was busy supporting a banquet or something is going on the way they submit orders. Food was great. loved the breads. decent service held back what would have been an excellent review
3
I used to go to The Clifford for lunch quite regularly. However since it has been rebranded La Brasserie I would have to say I have not been as impressed. Firstly whereas previously if I wanted a light meal I could go for one or two entrees or a chicken Caesar salad. However, the menu choices have been cut so you end up having the two or three course set meal which is not too cheap. The two last times I went I ended up with a pork chop which was very average and I could not finish it and fish which was tiny. Secondly, they do seem to try too hard to up sell the drinks or wine which in Singapore at lunchtime on a weekday is not going to work. On the other hand the service speed is generally quite good. La Brasserie - you may wish to revisit your menu choices and portion sizes as meals are not great value these days. Also I think your food standard may have dropped a bit
2
We visited La Brasserie on a Tuesday at 12.15pm for a business lunch. The restaurant is only half filled but service was very slow. Our bread came after our starters, main dish arrived at 45mins later at 1.15pm, and it's definitely overpriced. Average food but fine dining price. Not worth it
2
I love the Fullerton Bay and often go to the Clifford pier restaurant which nowadays is booked out thus for a business lunch I got the last table in la brasserie- interior - simply beautiful.tasteful- food - nice,not spectacular,had asparagus and fish dishes as well as the duck leg & the steak. nothing to vow,exciting but good qualitybiggest TURN OFF - staff at reception desk outside restaurant (one female who seems supervisor) ,rude, unfriendly,not the greatest marketing for the placeWould I go back? to the Fullerton bay any time,la brasserie less likely
1
the fullerton bay hotel is the best in singapore.unfortunately this restaurant, now renamed la brasserie, does not do it justice.we had the 4 course degustation menu; quality and presentation was at suburban standard, at world prices!service equally ordinary; you know that moment after the main course when the waiter clears the bread crumbs with a specially made implement....here they do it with a blue Super Chux!Singapore is full of outstanding restaurants. memo to fullerton bay guests...try somewhere else!I am usually a positive reviewer....but this place let us down badl

I came here for the 1st time , in part to try the food of a French michelin chef who was in town for the week. I expected a set meal and was surprised to see the restaurant in the middle of a buffet. After a few confusing minutes, they explained that the michelin menu is available in a la carteWhile looking at the menu, the French and local chefs actually came by to say hello which was a nice touch. after chatting, we agreed to try 2 starters that was to be shared with my friend, followed by our mains. the 2 starters - foie gras and eggplant, were ok but not outstanding . Then surprisingly , 2 more starters came! I didn't bother to kick up a fuss, and this prawn starter was also just slightly above averageMy main of fish with risotto was again pedestrian. my friend's chicken with truffle was slightly undercooked , which I thought was a no noWe decided to skip dessert since we had 2 starters each and also we weren't that excited about the food quality The other nice touch was that the staff kept filling our wine glasses at no extra chargeEnded with petit fours and even then, they weren't totally impressive Perhaps the regular menu here may be better ..
5
The breakfast buffet came with our hotel package, so I am not sure how much it would have cost. there was a wide variety of foods and everything we had was wonderful each morning. The service was also very good.
5
Amazing ambience and setting of the restaurant!! Truly a very romantic place to be at with ur loved ones. Appropriate food portion, price is definitely steep.
5
Ribs are a must, food generally great. Nice atmosphere and attentive yet unintrusive service. Strongly recommended.
4
Though the menu does not have a lot of variety, it has everyone's favourite and of good quality. Service was very good and attentive. Excellent environment as well.

It is a Tuesday evening and yet Clifford is bustling with hungry diners. The restaurant is 1 of the few among The Fullerton Bay Hotel and is housed in a nice colonial setting, pretty much like Au Jardin. My guest and i was greeted by a poker faced hostess who led us to our table without much of a word, not to mention any eye contact or half of a smile. Without saying the night didn't start as well as we would have liked. My guest and I were here for a special set menu and it costs $55 per person with 3 courses. Clifford adds to the menu by suggesting alternatives at an extra charge. The server who took our orders explained patiently to us the alternatives and soften the mood slightly after our encounter with the unfriendly hostess. First up, the bread... Alas i didn't take a photo of it but the bread basket is (almost) the highlight of the meal. The bread rolls are warm and soft and is served with butter and some sort of Pâté which was fragrant and appetizing. Next the starters... The mushroom soup is quite typical and really nothing outstanding. The Tuna Tartare is fresh and the greens on the side well seasoned and appetizing. Then the main courses - my guest's Whole Lobster Angel Hair was good though the pasta is slightly too generous. I had some short ribs which was very tender and tasty although it might be better if more tendons or fats were present. The bed of mash potatoes were a pleasant surprise as well, especially when u mix the sauce from the ribs into it. The dessert... well, pretty standard fare and i would rate them at a decent 6/10. Throughout the dinner, we were served by a very nice lady, EMMA, who spots a flip contrast from the hostess who brought us to our table. Emma was friendly and always carries a mesmerizing smile. She is ready to offer suggestions, engages in short dialogue but at the same time knows how to not intrude our space and dinner, as some over eager servers might do. Excellent service from Emma. I later concluded that almost all the staff working inside the restaurant, from the managers to the servers, were in fact friendly and service oriented. One has to ponder why Clifford decided to deploy the most unfriendly staff right at the door. Or perhaps it is just us... The ala carte menu at Clifford offers a decent variety as well. Starters are from $20++ and main courses are from $40-ish up. I would love to return to try their burgers and oysters

Our experience at Clifford started out well and unfortunately degenerated through the evening. This is a beautiful restaurant with tall ceilings and lush furnishing which made a great impression. Our starters came out well and we were expecting a very good meal. When our mains came, my palate was shocked by how over-salted our steak and spinach were. Our food was so salty we couldn't taste anything else subsequently. Quite a shocker for a fine dining restaurant. At those price points, you don't expect such a basic culinary mistake!

We had the lamb rack and roasted cod for mains, and the chocolate fondant and raisin apple crepe for dessert. The lamb was slightly tough and while it was not one of the best dinning experiences I have had in terms of quality of food, overall it was relatively good. I found the meal for four to be set at a reasonable price considering we had dessert and drinks. The interior was beautiful. I recommend sitting inside for dinner but outside for drinks. The location of the resteraunt is ideal in that you get a nice view from the outside or through the wall to floor glass windows if you are seated in doors. It was also relatively quiet and the romantic feel of the interior makes it ideal for a date or dinner with friends

Restaurant was huge with many seating and double volume. Came here on anniversary in October last year. Felt it deserved mentioning. Steak served was delicious and portion reasonable though fine dining style. Waiters eager to please albeit crowded towards 9pm given Friday evening. Spent $270 for 2 inclusive of half bottle of wine (4 glasses). Memorable dinner and highly recommended

the restaurant has very nice view, service standard was five star. Food portion is just nice and taste really good. They gave a complimentary mini desserts which comprises macaroon, white chocolate and cake. Usually the quality of the free staff will not be as good as the food you paid, but I must say that the free mini dessert was exceptional. Will visit again for sure

To top it, there's live music during Sunday lunch we were there, the lady singer had the most soothing voice ! Love this place, I will definitely recommend this, What we got for the price we paid which is about sgd85 per person is more than expected. Thank you

A quiet, intimate restaurant, with just the right level of service. Good quality food in sensible servings at sensible prices.

Stunning venue - Art Deco building beautifully restored with refined service and varied menu. Simple options for those of us who don't require degustation menus but no snobbery and beautiful manners. Worth every cent - highly recommended. Would return tomorrow!

I've been here for business lunches and with the wife....very formal style, albeit a modern room in a modern hotel.....but can't fault the food. Traditional Euromerican fare - meats in rich sauces, grilled or pan-fried fish - but well done.

First time at this restaurant. Great ambience with the restored old building with high ceiling and intimate settings. Service was very good with attentive and cheerful staff. Food was excellent. We had the duck confit and lamb rack. Mentioned briefly to the waiter that we were celebrating our anniversary and at the end of dinner, a cake appeared with the words "Happy Anniversary"!. Memorable evening. Highly recommended and will go again for sure

We stayed at the hotel and had breakfast here everyday at it was great quality and service. The manager Ida was delightful and super helpful helping us plan our day's activities.We had dinner here as well and the French fare was fantastic. Cherrie was delightful and Deborah the concierge at the hotel helped us get a last minute booking and we are so great full as the dinner was the best we had in Singapor

We first went to this place in 2013. We love the ambience of the restaurant, the quality of the food, selections of the wine and champagne, the romantic vibe of the decor and the friendliness of the staffs. We ended up having our wedding here in 2014. Everything was amazing. They have a patio with outdoor sofa for gentlemen to smoke their cigar with the view of the bay. There are two salon which you can book for your private functions. A separate private dining area also available with round table and amazing ceiling and chandelier. Open for lunch, dinner and have week-end brunch with fantastic entertainer. A Must Experience place but expect a $$$ in the end. Ask for Mylene or Sivan as their operational managements. They are very helpful and professional.

We went there for a Sunday brunch which includes free flow of champagne. Our 2 young children enjoy the food very much as there was a good selection of juices and desserts. We had so much food from the buffet section that we could not finish the main course that we ordered from the menu. The oysters and the lobsters are so fresh!!!

We had dinner at Clifford recently to celebrate my sister's birthday. The restaurant's interior is very stylish because of it's high ceiling and it's located right along the Marina Bay waterfront.  For our starters, we ordered Lobster Carpaccio (which is truly amazing and a must try) and the waitress recommended us their tasting portions so we can try some of their signature dishes. We had porcini mushroom soup, lobster angel hair and foie gras for us to share. Then for our mains, we had Suckling Pig, Seared Black Cod (both from their White Truffe Promotion), Duck Confit and Roasted Lamb Rack. The dishes are really great and tasty and we all enjoyed it. For our dessert, we had their Signature Apple Tart Tatin and Souffle. I loved it!! After the desserts are served, the staff surprised us with a small cake and candle for my sister. We all had a great night here in Clifford and I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends. Food is great, service is excellent. A bit pricey though but it's all worth it. :

We went to Clifford recently to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It is a beautiful restaurant with lovely ambiance. fyi - Don't bother with windows as there is no view in the restaurant. Our biggest issue was with the service - which pretty much didn't exist. I think it is a management issue versus a staff issue. There seemed to be loads of young guys running around with bread baskets and such, but only 2 ladies who seemed to be doing the actual waiting on the tables - orders, food, drinks, etc. We waited 10 minutes on a glass of wine and asked twice for a beer too. No one ever came back with water or to see if we wanted more wine etc. Every time we needed something we had to flag down a staff. Usually it took 2-3 tries before anyone would make eye contact and actually respond. Shocking for this kind of restaurant. Perhaps there were some high dollar rooms in the back as the service in our section was very poor. Seems the work/tables were not very evenly distributed. Our waitress was nice and professional when she came, but very distracted and rarely came. She seemed very busy.There was also an issue with the steak. I had ordered a medium well steak which had to be sent back twice as it was served rare the first time with blood all over the plate. Second time it was returned maybe medium so we tried for a 3rd time to get it cooked enough. I will say they brought more accompanying items when it was recooked which was very considerate. But, i don't like my steak to be bloody and asked for just a little bit of pink.After the second return a manager came over, and said they would make a whole new steak. This was nice, but now i had waited for 15 minutes + and the rest of the family was finished.The place is lovely, i will probably give them a second try. But, i hope they do something about the service. You expect staff to come back with wine, water, dessert etc at a restaurant of this caliber.After dinner we went up to the Lantern and had a lovely time. Beautiful and nice drinks with great music and atmosphere

I love the ambiance of the setting at Marina Bay and the tasteful decor of the restaurant. The French-inspired food was excellent, and our wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. They were very generous in their champagne by the glass pours, something unheard of in Singapore! My dining partner and I were celebrating being back in Singapore, and we both were delighted by the Clifford dining experience

I hope this restaurant survive. Given the poor food quality and high price (relative to food portion), I doubt it can draw local crowd. It cannot just depend on foreigners or visitors.

Firstly, I would like to make it clear that I'm writing the review for Clifford Restaurant not Clifford Pier. The Clifford restaurant serves French, American and Italian dishes where as the latter serves local cuisine. I noticed that many reviewers, reviewed the Clifford pier restaurant instead of the Clifford restaurant over here, which is very misleading and annoying. Recently, I dined here with my wife on my birthday along with our infant daughter. The restaurant is located on the right extreme corner of the hotel. The restaurant offers great view of the waterfront with its ten meter high glass panels to the ceiling and the interior designs are stylishly done by Asia's leading designer.We ordered porcini mushroom soup for starters, mushroom risotto and carbonara for mains and their signature apple tart tatin (for two) for dessert. The mushroom soup serving was pretty small but it was bursting with flavours. The carbonara was presented with runny egg yolk and the sauce was light and creamy. The Apple tart was excellent! Warm tart with caramelised apple chunks served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Overall, It was a pleasant experience. Staffs were polite, efficient and friendly. The price is little steep side though.

I came expecting a nice sumptuous buffet spread but totally dismayed. The restaurant promotes it as an Asian Buffet on National Day nite priced at SGD$55++ per pax with free flow of tea/coffee.But the buffet spread was shocking. And I felt so ripped off. There was only chicken curry, vegetarian bee hoon ( which taste bland and no ingredients like fish cake, carrots, beans sprouts, egg nor mushrooms or sliced bean curd), it was just plain fried bee hoon, the other warm main is broccoli and carrots stir fry.In the light bites section, deep fried calamari, spring roll , satay. That's all!then there is the salad counter which is no big deal, lettuce, cabbage, all the sauces and salad creams, a dish with ham and cheese kind of salad, there was bandung drink , a pot of Szechuan soup which only taste heavily on msgthen a dessert booth with kueh kuehs which are the better tasting of the lot.It is the most miserable buffet I ever had in my life.Totally ripped of

I recently had a work lunch at Clifford (I had been a few times previously for dinner).The venue is good for work lunches. The menus allows a lot of different options depending on how hungry you are (I had a salad) and the portion sizes are good for lunch. The venue is relatively small but quiet which is good. Service is very professional and prompt. I'll be back

We had reserved table for 4 pax under the name of madam Mandy dhillion ! But certainly one of our. Closed friend also wann to join us ! The manage was so good it was accommodated us ! The food was good we had snail !!Beef carpaccio !Some good breads ! Good selection off menu I really enjoy buffola cheese ! Thnks

Went to Clifford restaurant for lunch with my wife.Restaurant served local crusine.Ambience is great. There was a live band set in the middle of the dining hall, but the band was not playing then when we visit. Guess their playing time should be the evening.Still not an issue for us.Service is excellent - we were served promptly by the staff on arrival, and our orders taken immediately once we flagged for attention. Staff were attentive and promptly topped up our glasses of water.Unfortunately, some food were not up to our expectation.I ordered laksa but frankly I think the laksa served in maxwell market might have tasted better.Nevertheless, diners are paying for the ambience as well on top of the local crusine. Moreover, staff are courteous and attentive. I would still recommend clifford for some nice meal with spouse.For me, I will be returning to clifford
4
We had the "hangover brunch" and very much enjoyed the choice of tasty food. The live Jazz music gave a pleasant touch to the relaxing atmosphere.We paid SGD 207 for two pax, without champagne free-flow. I can highly recommend this place for a great Sunday brunch

I wanted to book Clifford Pier, the newest restaurant in the Fullerton Bay Hotel but accidentally booked Clifford Restaurant instead. I was glad I did because we had an excellent lunch. Most the patrons were businessman and executives from the nearby Raffles Place. The ambience was excellent and the view from the restaurant was great.We opted for the set lunch and service was very prompt and reliable. The food was also good, including the bread which were freshly baked.Prices were reasonable, about $45 for a 2 course lunch (salad and mains). This is definitely the place to go if you want to clinch a business deal or to impress your guests

had a most enjoyable lunch at clifford, fullerton bay hotel, on 27.3.2014, in the company of good friends – hugo, a close dutch friend was visiting singapore, & PL, who had helped me a lot in my earlier ventures, and who insisted on buying lunch. we were served bread – baguette & multi-grain roll. both were good, and especially so as they were served with duck rillettes in addition to the usual butter. i had lunch at clifford maybe 1.5 years ago with my dining quartet which has now discontinued. food & ambience were truly excellent, especially as we had the uob 1 for 1 at S$68 (so S$34pax) 3-course lunch then. the price is a lot more now, 2-course for S$48, and 3-course for S$58, coffee included. we took the 2-course. the appetizer choices included a salmon tartar, a mushroom veloute & i think a salad (cannot quite recall). the mains choices included a herb crusted lamb loin, a dory fillet, and a pasta (can’t recall what). there were a lot more appetizer & mains choices but they came with supplements.PL ordered the lobster salad (top photo – looked just fabulous) – S$12 supplement, and the 220g beef entrecot (a ribeye or scotch fillet steak) – S$25 supplement. i ordered the salmon tartar & lamb loin & hugo ordered same salmon & the dory. the salmon tartar was a good-size helping.the suave, efficient & polite restaurant manager prakash came by to ask about the food, so i gave him some feedback. i thought the salmon tartar was very fresh & sweet but the sour cream distracted & did not quite enhance the flavour (this part of course is subjective taste…). personally i like it with just sea salt & pepper & olive oil. those might already have been incorporated so perhaps just some additional fresh ground black peppers. i thought the prices were really too high, though fortunately the regular appetiser & mains (i.e. w/o supplements) were quite excellent. compare this with les amis’ 4-course S$45pax set lunch, which included choice of patagonia toothfish (the excellent chilean seabass my favourite fish) or quail. to be fair, i have not tried the les amis set lunch yet (will do soon enough!), but you know it’s les amis! likewise the excellent S$45pax set lunch we had at au jar din! & au jardin’s plating was also somewhat more artisan by comparison! or indeed the exquisite & simply fabulous S$48 3-course lunch at gordon grill at goodwood park, with 3 mini appetisers & 3 mini soups.prakash was very receptive & accommodating. he offered us a complementary citrus lychee drink. PL declined so we had 2 glasses.my herb crusted lamb loin was excellent, nicely medium rare & flavourful with hardly any gamey taste. my friends were asking what was the crust (breadcrumbs with spinach, basil etc) as c/w my own pistachio crusted rack of lamb. the dory looked great.the beef entrecot looked perfectly charred. PL like it well done. somehow it did not quite look like 220g, not sure if it was dry aged for more intense flavours & so had some weight loss.we had coffee & petit fours (which means small oven & not 4 items!). macarons were too sweet. nutty chocolates were ok. i did not try the cake but it should be good.overall, the service was efficient & responsive, the ambience was just super, and the food quality quite excellent. i can’t say food was better than au jardin though (in fact i thought au jardin’s was better) & of course the price was not just marginally but significantly higher than les amis (S$48 2-course vs S$45 4-course set lunch) or au jar din or gordon grill. i will come here for its great ambience, service & food, but sparingly. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/03/29/excellent-lunch-company-clifford-on-27mar2014

Located along the scenic river, the restaurant has a super-high ceiling, giving one a feeling of comfort and spaciousness. The staff were professional, yet warm and friendly, often anticipating what we needed.The manager was always on hand whenever we needed, and passionately explained the food that we were enjoying so much that day.Our starter was a salmon sashimi with salmon roe, folowed by a slow-cooked egg on a bed of truffled mash, with a piece of truffle on top.The main course was heavenly, a perfectly roasted pork belly with just the right amount of fat that just melted in my mouth.The dessert was good, but I'm not a big fan of salty caramel, and didn't help when I bit into a big chunk of salty while just thinking they went easy on the salt. (Otherwise 5 stars)Definitely worth a visit, and great for that special occasio

One of the best food we tried in Singapore. Good to see them in Tripadvisor. They worth it. They really have a professional ground crew. Their food are delicious we loved it .
5
We went there for an anniversary celebration. We had a wagyu beef steak which was just fantastic. The special moment went to the max when we were given a piece of cake with surprise to celebrate our anniversary. We were given a paranoid photo, signed off by the team for the anniversary. Such simple touch really made our day

I have previously experienced the original Fullerton Hotel champagne brunch, which blew my mind, the best buffet I have ever seen with free flowing champagne I had talked it up to all my friends . However they have changed this to the Fullerton Bay hotel Clifford restaurant and now it's just ho hum.. Nothing special just a typical lunch buffet. The setting is quite nice but nothing as lovely as the old Fullerton Hotel which was an old post office and a beautiful building. They still have champagne but the buffet is now so boring it's hardly worth the effort to get up to get something to eat.I won't be returnin

We had just finished the Singapore River Cruise and alighted from the boat near Clifford Pier. Being lunchtime and near the Clifford Pier Restaurant (part of the Fullarton Bay Hotel complex), we decided to have lunch. We checked the menu and whilst the prices were a little high, they were able to provide "gluten free" options for my wife. We were then taken to a table in this very stylish and beautiful interior restaurant. We then had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be waited upon. There was no excuse for this long wait as only a few tables were occupied at the time and there were a number of staff. It got to the point, where we were about to leave when a waiter came over to take our order. I must admit the food was excellent but the service was terrible
4
My friend and I went to Clifford Restaurant in the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The Hotel itself is very stylish and the interior design is gorgeous.We had made a reservation, however the restaurant, despite being nearly empty, made us wait for 20 minutes.When we sat down they looked down a little that we were staying at another Hotel and even suggested we were working at the hotel we were staying at!The waiter suggested we ordered the asparagus as an aperitif, and practically forced us to so we politely agreed. My trout starter was very good and sea bass main was delicious. I had fruit for dessert, my friend had the soufle which looked very impressive.I would go back, although I think the staff were very pushy and rather rude to us

Visited this restaurant for dinner with 7 colleagues. I had eaten lunch there before and always found it pretty good. But I will never go back for dinner.The good first - the restaurant is elegant and the food was OK. Well better than OK in fact but still you can find better food for the money elsewhere.Service was atrocious. It wasn't as if the restaurant was particularly busy but (1) they failed to give us a winelist when we arrived, (2) they took for ever to take our orders and had to be asked to do so. When the appetisers arrived (which took over 30 minutes) they came in 3 separate deliveries with a 5-10 minute wait between the first and last appetiser to arrive. Main courses equally took a long time to arrive and although they came in batches the time between batches was a bit less. They got one order wrong however.When we asked for a second bottle of white wine they managed to bring a different one from the one we had ordered first time.At the end of the evening they managed to not bring at least one of the coffees/teas we had ordered but by that point we were so eager to get out and so convinced that they would take too long to bring it that we just checked that they had not charged us for it on the bill (and to be fair they had not).We had also had a problem getting service in the bar outside the restaurant entrance - it felt as if at least 2 of us had to be waving vigorously at the staff in order to get any attention.They did recognise how poor service had been by not charging us for one of the bottles of wine we ordered, which was a plus of sorts.I realise that serving 8 is difficult but this is a 5 star hotel and you expect good service at those sorts of prices. The service we got was completely substandard and I at least will not be returning
3
My wife and I had passed by The Clifford several times on the way to the elevator to the Lantern Bar. The restaurant looks very elegant and so I booked a table. Unfortunately, the food was very ordinary and the service was quite lacklustre. Nothing special. We won't be going back again.
4
Went to Sunday brunch with my wife, we ordered the non-alcoholic buffet at S$98++ (so really S$ 115).Plus points were the high quality of the buffet items. We especially enjoyed the pork terrine and smoked fish. The mains we ordered were both delicious. Downsides - despite the Marina Bay location, most tables don't enjoy a bay view. Also while is undeniably good the S$100+ price tag does seem a bit on the high side
4
This luxurious and elegant restaurant has it all - ambience, enchanting setting, impeccable service and delectable dishes.With its lavishly furnished interior - think gilt mirrors, dark expensive wood, ornate furniture, and scented candles, this place hits one like a movie setting. Everything was glossy and perfect, a mixture of contemporary high life with hints of vintage. The wait staff were polite and professional as well. We loved the ambience itself already - even before being escorted to the tables with crisp white tablecloths and plush seats.Then my Honey Truffle Glazed Suckling Pig dish came - the cracklingly crispy skin concealing exceedingly tender, juicy flesh beneath it was heavenly to the bite - all the flavors of the pork itself, mercilessly bathed over with black truffle, Parsnip puree and cipollini - it was literally an explosion of goodness in the jaws.

The place is great. The decor, furniture and arrangements of the table was very pleasing, and the full-length windows that provided the view of the bay was wonderful.Upon arrival I was attended to promptly by the lady at the counter, and shown to my table. Once I was seated, I was provided the menu, and asked if I wanted any drinks to start with. The lovely service continued throughout my time there, and the food was also quite okay. ... No, I can't say it was fantastic, but it was just okay. Well the bread they served, together with butter and the spread, was lovely. The starter I had, a soup, tasted great too. But my main, which consisted of truffle fries and angus steak, was not so ideal. The fries were good. Very tasty. My real problem was with the angus steak. While the taste of the steak was great, I wasn't thrilled about the quality of the meat itself. This isn't the first time I've had medium-rare steak, but this is definitely the first time I've had steak that is so bloody tough and difficult to chew, in a high-end restaurant such as the Clifford. Within 5 minutes into the meat, I could feel my jaw growing tired from the chewing. As it is, I never finished the meat. It's already a bonus that I could get through about two-thirds of it. You call that steak? I've had steak done rare, and it's better than this one. More tender and easier to chew.All in all, I really did quite enjoy my experience at Clifford, but the terrible steak was really major points deducted
4
Great service and great food! Classic black and white all around gives it a classy ambiance. Breakfasts are served at the Clifford too.

I come here very often for my business lunch. I like the atmosphere and the nice menu. Not too many choices but very nice. Service is also good.
2
Went there with my friend for lunch and I have been there several times. Unfortunately this is the worst experience . First , staff was really cold. Upon the reception, the waitress could not be bother to greet us but kept sending txt via her iPhone.Second, the service was really slow. It took us almost half hour to have our starter and the main was just cold when I started eating and I had to sent it back .The waiter did not even make an apology when I told them the main was cold. When they re-presnetd my main, they even forgot to bring the cultery and I have to wait for another five min to get my fork and knife.Wont visit again and as the over experience was really poor for the money we spent

Great decor and ambience. Perfect dating restaurant.We were here very close to Christmas, and so we took on a festive menu for the degustation. It was about $100 pp including a bottle of champagne. The food was great, but the foie gras 2 ways was not quite my thing, and the dessert was way too heavy. However, the lobster bisque and the fish were perfect. Loved it.Afterwards, make sure you go to the roof top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel (where the restaurant is) and check out the even better views of Marina Bay at Lantern Bar
5
Of the Bay, especially at night with the intensely romantic lights glittering on the water through the full-length windows. Opulent setting, skating close to over-ornate but rescued by a few modernist touches. Service was great - a little mistake in the final bill was swiftly rectified with profuse apologies. And food was, despite some initial misgivings imparted by hearsay, excellent
5
A wonderful dining experience - great decor, an amazing atmosphere which is all part of the charm and elegance of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, efficient and unobtrusive service, a charming menu, and delightful food.What more - well there are the views across Marina Bay which themselves are stunning.A magnificent dining experience. I would add that I had the seafood risotto - I could not fault it all; one of the best risottos I have ever enjoyedMagnifique. - French to a

Walking into the jazz music- filled, high ornate-ceilinged lounge-like dining room with a view of the Marina Bay area through the full-glass panel window on one side, one is immediately transported back to a time when long Sunday lunches were in fashion. The service of the attentive but unintrusive wait staff is as glittering as the sunlight dancing on the water in the bay. Even as one's knife slips accidentally into the dish of the main course, a waitress comes alongside to replace it with a clean one. The French cuisine we decided on for lunch was prepared and presented with finesse. The multigrain brown buns and butter loaves were served with duck pate, besides a disc of butter engraved with the 'f' of the Fullerton Bay Hotel that houses the restaurant. The French onion soup was just flavourful with its caramelised onion slivers and cheese crouton. The duck confit had a lightly crisped skin to be enjoyed with the sweet bean sauce a la Peking Duck style. The dessert of strawberry consomme was the proverbial cherry on the cake as the ice-cream was doused in a raspberry sauce crowned with a caramelised sugar ring. Our cappuccino came with the 'f' dusted in chocolate powder on the froth and a little sweet surprise- petit fours of fruity kueh lapis (Peranakan layered cake), macaroons and sugared jelly cubes.The contemporary style of the cuisine is as much appreciated as the sincere assistance of the staff who leads one out onto the balcony pier to show the way for a walk around the bay on a sunny afternoon

Went to the Clifford to celebrate my 50th birthday, omg! Having been to many champagne lunch buffets I have to say this is in my top 3!Oysters to die for, beautiful sushi. Best sea bass I have had in years! The service was impeccable, the jazz singer was wonderful! We had to slow them down with the free flowing Perrier jouet!!! Yum, perfectly chilled too! Staff were friendly, service first class!!! It's such a pleasure to be treated so well in a restaurant, we have cancelled another booking and are going back to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, that's how great it was!!Thank you to everyone at the Clifford for a fantastic lunch
5
nice, classy, romantic or even business dinner , this place can fit any occasion. relatively inexpensive the food and the service are amazing. I always go there when I receive friends and family in Singapore. I am French and I really like those truffle fries there. highly recommended. the restaurant is facing the marina bay sands however the restaurant is located on the side so the view could be better, but anyway atmosphear is still very cosy

We tried out this restaurant as we were blessed with some vouchers for the Sunday Champagne buffet lunch. Do remember to book well in advance as they can run quite full on Sunday brunch. They have quite a good spread of food (oysters, boston lobsters, prawns,...) and it is pretty fresh. Do reserve some space for the main course though. The main highlight is of course the champagne which we took our time to enjoy till the buffet ends at 3 pm
5
The range of choices are expansive, with something to suit most tastes. The service is the best I've experienced in Singapore.

The website says a French restaurant - it is not, its western with the obligatory burger. The wine list was terrible and expensive Cote du Rhone is not a burgundy. The service was OK but the food was really poor. I had lobster & Scallop Carpaccio; it was so bland and insipid that I could hardly make out the scallops and the plate was oily - not taste YUK! I then had duck confit (which was good) but the portions were tiny. My husband had rack of lamb which was satisfactory. Dessert - I had trio of crème brulee. Unbeknown to me as I couldn't taste anything, it was pandan, chocolate and crème. The first one - no way could anything be that green (must have spilt the food colouring), I had to ask what the chocolate one was as I had no idea, and the crème was an egg custard - appalling. I will not recommend this restaurant the decor was lovely BUT that was it

I was impressed by the ambience of the place... Posh... High ceiling... Perfect lighting...We were seated by the window in a semi private corner overlooking the river with Singapore's lights dancing at its edge. Amazing view. Perfect. We ordered a 4 course dinner and a bottle of Clos Du Marquis '96 - St Julien. Excellent wine by the way. My Fiancé didn't coordinate the proposal with the waiter but when she realized what just happened... She served us a "Congratulations" dessert. The service was excellent .., we had a little mishap on the bottle of wine because my Fiancé ordered a vintage wine... I think cork got dried up bec of wrong storage... Anyway, the sommelier immediately took over & replaced our bottle... We even had some impromptu wine lessons...Honestly, I wasn't able to finish my meal because of the excitement... But presentation & service is spot on... Clifford's would always have a special place in my heart

We had a group of 7 people tonight. Given that we had the 30% discount voucher & 2 bottles corkage free, the meal was altogether outrageously bad. For starters some of us had the seasonal truffle menu, without the discount. I had the scrambled eggs with truffles -$32, which came in a hugh plate of mesclun salad, i couldn't even see the scrambled eggs. They apparently were embedded in the pile of salad in the form of nuggets and drenched with truffle oil! Very disappointing for a fine dine. My main was a lobster pasta. The menu mentioned 1 whole lobster -$52 (which i thought was cheap), clearly not, as there were about 4 tiny pieces of lobster, drenched in tomato sauce. It almost looked like something one would find in an airport cafeterias. The sauce lacked flavours, the texture of the pasta was overdone & the pasta was swimming in the sauce. To my dismay, I asked the waiter who the chef was & he rattled off an italian name - Sandro.....I cannot imagine an italian not being proud of one of their national dishes! Clearly he was not around. The dessert, a rhubarb mousse of some sort came sorely lacking of rhubarb flavours, the presentation looked like something I would find in a nonya cake shop. We mentioned this to our waitor & he did not seem one bit apologetic, not to mention, wines wasn't poured to our glasses. We paid $75 per bottle corkage for 5 other bottles & before we left, there were about 1/3 left in 2 of our red wine bottles. That included a Smith Haut Lafitte 2000 & a bottle of Pichon 1990. For a restaurant with it's brillant decor, their food really needs much work!

I had friends and family from Europe visiting us recently. After a spicy Singaporean dinner, we decided to go there to have Dessert and enjoy the view. At the restaurant we were offered a choice of 3 flavours of ice cream. So one of us chose chocolate fondant-vanilla, 2nd was chocolate-strawberry 3rd Choco-vanilla and I ordered a so called "coffee affogato". After 25-30 minutes we finally got our desserts. Big surprise, the ice cream was of the size of half a table tennis ball and sadly presented in a big bowl. We had to insist to have them topped-up with whip cream. Taste and presentation was nothing fancy. As to my dessert coffee , it was simply a rather small cup of espresso coffee with whip cream and by the time it was served, the ice cream, if any, had melted. Charged S$14+ ! I had expected something like a decent size of glass containing some coffee with a real ball of ice cream. We thought this was the most simple order and did not want to embarrass the waitress who tried but had to have us repeated 2x our orders while she wrote them. Also, another waiter mistakenly brought to us the order from someone else... Our total bill was around $60 but above all, it was not a nice experience of "dessert by the bay" that I initially praised to my guests !! Overall, service was very slow and below the standards of such category. Pricey compared to average quality. So admire the view but don't expect much

Went with family for the Sunday champagne lunch. Sensible size spread full of luxury food like oysters, lobster, roast beef, trout etc, quite decadent but thoroughly enjoyable. You get to order a main course (large choice) with starters and pudding as a buffet. I would have happily foregone my mains and just concentrated my efforts on the starters. The service was outstanding and not intrusive. Prices reflect the market rate in Singapore and are relatively reasonable for what you get. Champagne was truly free flow with constant top-ups being offered. Come for the champagne lunch here and expect to waddle off in a most unsteady fashion

First experience at the Clifford restaurant for my birthday celebration. Having seen nice pictures from the restaurant and reading nice reviews, I was expecting to spend a nice evening on the occasion.Unfortunately I confess I’ve been really disappointed. First the food is not worth the price they charged. I had the pissaladiere tartlet and the pan fried seabass with veggies. Honestly the two dishes were tasteless, basic flavors, not what we expect from a restaurant from that standard. I can do easily the same at home, and for less cost.My husband had a New York cut of beef with French fries, not bad, but just grilled Go to Hutcher Butcher and do it yourself at home, you’ll have the same.Now speaking about the service, the staff was simply friendly but not as professional as they should be in this category of hotel.For the main course, my husband requested to have a glass of wine and an additional plate of fries with his meat. The wine arrived early first. And he had to request the fries as they forgot the order. So we have to wait another 10 min to start eating, the meat becoming almost cold.And finally, just after finishing our main course, the staff cleaned the plates and took away the bread. I know Asian people like this kind of service, but not European people, and I think they should be careful and make the difference between customers to take this into consideration.After the desserts, the staff came with a complementary piece of cake, which I admit was a nice attention, but as always the traditional chocolate cake. What about people like me who don’t like chocolate ? It would be great if they can ask about person’s dislike during the reservation.To summarize, the place is not worth the money you spend. You can easily find other restaurants with nice views and better food. I don’t mind spending money, but it should reach my expectations

Set along the quayside in a charming enclave of buildings with a rich heritage, this restaurant offers formal dining with superb food and service. The warm bread rolls with duck rillete pâté set the meal off on the right note. White asparagus dishes were perfectly done and the oysters were fresh and succulent. The Wagyu foie gras burger with truffle fries was delectable. Lobster angel hair, lamb rack and steak and frites all great. Leave some space for desserts - the chocolate manjari cake is a real favourite and a signature cake not to be missed

My family and I had dinner here. The restaurant is elegant and the ambience is very good. From the moment you arrive, the service is first class. I would add that all the waiters were very friendly, courteous and efficient at all times. We could not fault anything. We had a mixed starter of salmon, Wagu beef carpaccio, mozzarella with tomato and a delicious mushroom coffee cup dish. Outstanding.The main course portions were good - just right. Food piping hot and served impeccably well. We had the beef cheek and mussels and I have to say that they were some of the best we have eaten in Asia. Compliments to the Chef. Overall, very much worth a visit. You will not be disappointed. Well done to Ziahul who was looking after us - amazing service and knowledgable. A credit to the Fullerton Bay

We had a lovely four-course (and petit fours/coffee/tea) dinner for $55+ during Singapore Restaurant Week in March 2013. The setting in Fullerton Bay Hotel was really stunning and classy with a view of the bay- the best kind of place for a romantic dinner date! The service was top-notch - efficient and flawless yet always polite and smiling. The food was delicious - while warm bread arrived at the table with some chicken pate, we started with french onion soup with a generous amount of gruyere cheese. It was rich and just sweet enough. Next was a trio of wagyu beef with parmesan crisp and ocean trout. For a main I have the beef dish with a side of truffle fries which was a slightly small portion for a made but really very delicious and cooked to medium perfection. Dessert was choux pastry with chocolate and passionfruit sauce - yummy! I think I will definitely be back to try their full ala-carte menu for a special occasion in the future - I believe they're quite pricey but after having a taste of the quality, I'm sure it will be well-worth it

Ate breakfast and lunch once whilst staying at the FBH on business. No complaints other than the service at lunchtime was very slow. The restaurant was not packed and even if it had been slow service is inexcusable in a hotel of this standard.

Great location, decent food, quite slow and haphazard service - not up to standard for a hotel restaurant of this calibre.

Beautiful setting, attentive staff and lovely food. Great set menu for dinner @ $298 - four courses - all delicious and a bottle of Perrier Jouet Champagne!
Loved it!

Loved its classy and sophisticated setting. You can impress your date or business associates here. The steak was fantastic. Even better than the Morton's.

Went there last week as part of the Perrier Joulet Champagne dinner. Pre-dinner capanes were excellent, the tuna cappacio on a filo pastry really stood out. Soup was a lobster bisque, main was a super tender pork loin, and the dessert was a lemon cream souffle style. All excellent. Service was efficient and courteous. Will be back

We were here for a birthday brunch. Good to be able to make your own bloody mary, the addition of sherry and celery salt would be even better. Food was pretty delicious, decent roast pork with superb apple sauce. Why oh why are main courses so disappointing? The descriptions are fabulous, but the dish that arrives is not the same at all. Duck Bubble and Squeak sounds great, but when it appears with 2 pieces of duck, loads of potato and very little cabbage..? Beefed up Mac and cheese was mostly pasta. Having said that, the Salted caramel was gorgeous. So much so that having shared one between us my dear one ordered another just for himself!The house pour wine was good, red being better than the white. Irritating to be charged for mineral water, when one is paying already

Food was good but service was a little bit slow.The time gap between starter and main was just too which annoyed me a little bit. Need focusing some small details which could bring this restaurant from Good to Excellent! I did not think that I got enough value out of money I spent , although the food is delicious.

A friend recommended this restaurant for special occasion dining and the food fit the bill but not the service. It was amateur hour from start to finish and on a Saturday night at one of Singapores fancy new hotels one just did not expect that. The waiters all seemed to be in training and id not know whether the Entrees on he menu were main course sized (US term for main course) or starters. A more senior waiter (Maitre D?) had to come over and explain. Small portions of a terrine -like substance appeared with the bread rolls unexplained and, given one of our partyvwas a vegetarian we had to call someone over to ask what it was -just as well we did as it was duck terrine. We practically had to wave our arms round to order drinks and food. A request to substitute a different fish in the degustation menu was refused. The waiters seemed unfamiliar with the basic French dishes - when asked to explain duck confit, it was described as 'deep fried duck leg'. ' do you mean slow cooked in it's own juices then seared to finish, something like that? 'yes Mam, deep fried duck leg'. With such a description conjuring up a KFC drumstick of duck, I ordered it and crossed my fingers, and started joking about Manuel of Fawlty Towers fame. Google it if you don't know it. most of the food was very good (duck was a traditional French confit, much to my relief;salmon excellent, Bouillaibesse so-so) . after a long wait having finished our main course the waiter came over with four menus to see if we wanted dessert; we had to explain that 3 of us, having the degustation, were waiting for ( and waiting.....) the dessert included, which took some time to sink in. By the time the cappuccino arrived with a letter 'f' in chocolate on the top we were convinced it stood for 'Fawlty' not Fullerton.... It was a quiet night for a Saturday so rather surprising that the service was so hard to get

Fine dining with very good and attentive service. This restaurant is nestled in the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Enjoyed the food and ambience a lot. Varieties on the menu is limited but almost every item is exquisite. Food quality is very good. Very high ceiling with dim lighting. Note however the view is not facing the Marina Bay Sands

Lovely elegant restaurant in the beautiful Fullerton Bay Hotel. The food was more modern than traditional French and very good. But what impressed us most was the great service. Our servers were sincerely friendly, very helpful with menu recommendations and anticipated our needs - eg. getting extra plates so that our kids could share the starters & desserts with us and bringing out a small birthday cake for my husband. The 10-minute walk from the One Fullerton building where we parked our car to the restaurant was a lovely one by the water. Restaurant is definitely recommended for a special occasion or special date
