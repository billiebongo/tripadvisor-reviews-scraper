If you wanted to find the taste of Hong Kong "Da Pai Dong" (meaning street style cooking) in Singapore, try Tonny Restaurant. The best thing is we ordered something outside the menu, the staff provided various options which turn out to be quite nice.

One of the best scallop dishes I have had in Singapore, and its one of their house specials definitely worth a try. Good range of choice, in a casual atmosphere and quite low corkage as well.

Yam in truffle oil, fish meat noodle, putin fish w chili and garlic, pork neck, steam prawns w garlic, fried long beans w dried prawns, sea cucumber w beancurd.....all these food were superb and scumptious! Only disappointed was the Yusheng. Other than that worth going there for dinner. Highly recommend

Food was good in terms of quality and variety. The price is slightly on the high side for family meal. But all of us enjoyed the food, particularly the black chicken soup. Air-con was too cold at the restaurant though, which made our dishes turn cold quickly.

Located few Lorongs (Malay word for street) away from the famous red light district in Geylang, this Cantonese restaurant is a popular hunt amongst the locals. Ample parking as there is a public multi storey car park besides the restaurant. It is also within 10 minutes walk from Kallang MRT.We were particularly impressed with their signature dish - crispy shredded yam with truffle. You could taste the strong smell of truffle in the dish. A rather unusual dish that make a great appetizer. The next dish most liked very much was the claypot beef cube with carrot and reddish. It may look like an ordinary claypot dish but once you tasted the tenderness of the beef with its accompanying sauce together with the sweetest of the reddish, it was mama mia! I would come back for more.Other dishes ike Peking duck, butter big prawns, roast chicken, tofu with mushroom and French beans with dried prawns were spot on too. Roast chicken meat was tender with the crispy skin. Loved the tofu and the king mushroom.There are many more great dishes but will keep it for the next visit.

We had the 1 for 1 promo for 10pax @ $515 all inclusive tea, towels & taxes. Itâ€™s 6 course meal. We deem it a little pricey for what was offered. Shark cartilage soup with fish maw was a little too diluted. Braised Abalone was the only more expensive dish. It was a birthday celebration and our request to change the steamed rice with noodles was not entertained neither was our request for birthday buns. Restaurant was manned by many mandarin speaking staff. They were generally polite and courteous.

My third visit to this restaurant. This time with my business friends. We ordered crispy yam with truffle oil, double boiled black chicken soup, smoke soon hock fillets in clay pot and steamed glutinous rice with chinese sausages. The glutinous rice is average. We like all the other 3 dishes very much - unique and tastety. They are must-try dishes. My business friends like the food so much that they decided to have their next monthly OLD FRIENDS GATHERING in this restaurant. The restaurant is spacious and atmosphere is good - suitable for family gathering and also good for business meeting. This is one of my favorite restsurants

Hidden in a lazy corner of Geylang, one could easily dwarf what it has to offer to the bevy of chinese restaurants in the busy area. Having survived the notoriously tough food business for decades, it finally earned a visit from us and by the time we left it was we who felt that we have been missing out! The setting was unpretentious , simple but immaculate. The food are cantonese cuisine done in authentic flavor , I assumed the kitchen is helmed by owner chef Tonny himself. Food standard was above average and I love the small menu which removed the indecisiveness but good enough to have a decent selection. Despite that we went on a promotional deal, the service was impeccable, always having someone to suggest and serve our needs. Food was not rushed through but served one after another, wedding style! I will like to return there to try their roast items and its exclusive menu.

In a secluded corner of Geylang is this amazing Chinese restaurant. Chef Tonny whips up creative (mainly) Cantonese dishes such as this Christmas tree-esque crispy yam in truffle oil, "crouching tiger hidden dragon" , double boiled shark's cartilage soup with fish maw, boiled joshu beef in superior soup etc etc. Not your usual fare in a typical Chinese restaurant

Great place for Cantonese cuisine. Chef Tonny is constantly trying to create dishes not found elsewhere. So Kudos!I booked for dinner during the CNY period, despite the busy period, service was pretty prompt and good. First time I had Lou Hei paired with iberico pork...good combinatio, beats the salmon version anytime.The garlic steam prawns was memorable, another must try is the truffle yam.Their Cantonese soups are always hearty and yummy.My highlight was the noodle made from fish paste, fried with shimeji mushroom.Pack in some chili padi and it will leave you wanting more

Friends from work invited us to this place for a taste of the local life before we move back to the US. It's a very local place with a TV on the wall and a large room in the back for banquets. Not fancy at all but fresh ingredients. We were there on a Friday night and it was especially slow. The food was pretty darn tasty - the crispy yam and truffle oil was yummy and I liked the fried crispy salmon skins. Service was attentive. We brought our own champagne and wine and they happily poured it for us. Cost for 4 adults was less than $200 with no alcohol. If you like Cantonese food, I think this is a good find

Plenty of parking nearby, if not it's a 10min walk from Kallang MRT.Dinner on a weekday, restaurant only had a few tables occupied, service was good.Yam w truffle essence was a gd starter to wet the appetite as the yam was crispy & light with drizzling of truffle essence.Shark bone soup was wholesome & full of gelatinous goodness, however it would have been even better if there weren't so many small bone splints in the soup, maybe it was due to the way it was chopped up.Tofu w mushrooms in some spicy sauce was alright but can do without.Grilled kurobuta was nicely done but was as expected.Steamed fish was fresh.Roast chicken was succulent & good.Glutinous rice with assortment of waxed meats was full of flavour & worth ordering if your not counting calories.Had another 2 regular stirfried vegetable dishes.Overall a nice dinner, enjoyed the soup & the glutinous rice the most but at this price point one would have quite a bit of other options in a nicer setting with similar offerings

I was looking for a nice place for diner and found it with nice review. I must say : never again, it's expensive, not thin, not good, the service is just hardly good enough. Don't loose your time and pass your way, Singapore got a lot of cheaper places that are delicious!

Toony is run by a Hong Kong chef, who specializes in Cantonese dishes.His dishes were full of flavors and he used quality ingredients to create his dishes.The price of the food was reasonable in consideration of the good quality and reasonable portion.I would definitely go back there again

Went to try Tonny Restaurant after seeing friends post pictures of their experience online. Generally, we found the dishes nice - especially their truffle yam appetizer.The pricing was a bit high in my view... But I guess it depends from person to person.At least I managed to try this restaurant

Tucked away in a shop house amidst the HDB flats is Tonny. They serve HK style cooking as the chef hails from Hong Kong. dÃ©cor is simple but food is good. ample parking is available in the multi storey car park next door. a must try is the crispy yam with truffle oil and the pig trotters bee hoon
5
This restaurant serves very delicious Chinese food at reasonable prices. There is a parking lot conveniently located next to it as well. Overall very tasty dishes, but not a very big selection, and it is always crowded, so it will take awhile for the food to arrive

This is our third visit to Tonny Restaurant and it never fails to exceed our expectations. Their signature dish of crispy yam and truffle oil is to die for as is the pan fried diced fish cake. Tonny even agreed to prepare chilli crab and crab bee hoon, both of which were not on his normal menu. Can't imagine why as the chilli crab was fresh and spectacular. Will be coming back for more of Tonny's fantastic cuisine on our return visits to Singapore.
