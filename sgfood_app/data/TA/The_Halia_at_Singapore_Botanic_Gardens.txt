Dennis Castro! Look for him. One of the friendliest waiter we‚Äôve ever met and an excellent service! Had dinner with a guest and our baby. The food is amazing and we love it. Will definitely come back when we visit singapore again! üòä
5
I tried the Halibut Fish and the Singapore style spaghetti. Both are fantastic. Raja gave us great service and recommended us the best drinks in the menu. Overall great experience
2
We went for an official group dinner. Food was very mediocre at least for me-- i had crab pasta. Dessert was also ordinary.
5
Everything was just perfect. The ambience, food, service and even the other patrons! Will definitely come back for more!
5
Good atmosphere, fusion food and location. The crew was very knowledgeable, patient and accommodating.

Managed to book for a party of 10 for a company lunch at the very last minute!Staff also helped arrange for indoor sitting, which was not available at first.We ordered 10 set lunches.Starter - we didn't quite enjoy it. Some said it tasted like baby food. Some texture would be great too.Main - Chili Crab Spaghettini(6.5/10)quite filling, Steak(7/10)not so fillingDessert - die die(9/10), ginger(6.5/10)Coffee was simple but great!Held a last minute birthday surprise and the servers was very enthusiastic. We even sang in 3 different languages!Would love to come again Special thanks to our server, Raja, for handling our staff really well (Give him a pay raise already!

The food and the service from your staff are amazing, quick response was made after I made the reservation on the day itself. My fiance certainly loved the place & he did not expect a lovely birthday surprise from your staff. The atmosphere of The Halia Restaurant is the most cozy and it was beautifully lit at night. I would certainly recommend this place to my family & friends. Keep up the good service!
4
We ordered a few different things to share, and they were all great - definitely the best meal of the trip. Would recommend the crab pasta, carpaccio and halloumi dishes. The only thing I was disappointed by - because I had researched the restaurant before visiting - was that you're not really dining in the trees as a lot of the promotional photos suggest. Our table was approx. two metres from a path with people walking by. However, it's very nicely designed and the service was decent
5
Third time visiting the Halia at 3 different occasions and it was never a disappointment. Loved the Chilli crab bun the best but I must recommend trying the Braised Wagyu Nasi Lemak. My Mommy is a fussy eater yet she said the Nasi Lemak was good. I had opted for the 'healthier option' of avocado toast. And it tasted awesome too! And it is indeed a pleasure to have Ms Alice Lim serving us. On 3 different occasion she had served me and her smile and friendly disposition always makes it an added bonus at The Halia. What are you waiting for guys? Go there pronto and try yourself!
5
A group of 8 of us recently dined at Halia for a birthday celebration, and the wonderful service we received made it a very enjoyable experience for us.Their desserts were delicious and we loved the creative combination of flavours (just wish the portions were bigger :) All the service staff members who looked after our table were so attentive - really appreciated how they answered our queries & requests so patiently and helped us with the birthday celebration. We also wanted to make a special mention of Ms Mae, who was so warm and friendly from start to finish. We're looking forward to our next visit
5
After a long walk through the beautiful orchid garden we had a nice rest in the Halia restaurant with an excellent service.
Her recommendations and explanations received by the waitress were very helpful. Worth to stop by.
5
Beautiful place! Food was good and service was great. Thanks to Tao Ha, Maru, Raja & Elton for making our dinner experience such a great one!
5
The food and atmosphere were both lovely. The risotto was rich and creamy and the nasi lemak had good flavour. Thank you Alice for recommending us dishes and being so nice and informative.
1
While a nice setting, the food was horrible and they do not serve alcohol at the restaurant. Very disappointing .
3
Nice ambience and setting, the service was good but the food was a bit let down. We are vegetarians and we were fine with the choices available but the food didn't taste that great. It was very average. Maybe the non-vegetarian choices are better.
5
Beautiful place in the middle of the Botanic Gardens wonderful food and reasonable prices, served by Tao Ha and what a lovely girl, really cared about us having a nice time which made the experience so much better.
5
Had an excellent meal here with a friend. Nice environment to enjoy great food and have a good chat. Service was excellent as always.
5
We had our Valentine‚Äôs dinner at The Halia. It‚Äôs a romantic dinner place in the middle of the Botanic Garden Singapore. The food was great and without any negative surprises. Unfortunately no alcohol but of course it‚Äôs a halal restaurant. The excellent service by Dennis Castro made our evening. Thank you very much for this
4
Have visited Halia many times and i'm sure will return again. The food is always delicious and the staff are friendly, however service is consistently very slow. They are slow to seat you, slow to take your orders, to serve you drinks/food and bring your bill etc. It has been the same every time we've visited.I'm not sure if they just don't have enough members of staff for the size of restaurant or whether the service is any quicker inside (we always opt to sit outside as the surroundings are so beautiful).That being said, we still love this place as the food/atmosphere makes up for it. Great place to take visitors too.Tip - If you can visit during the week the set menu is great value but only served Mon-Fri
4
Service was great. We chose the outdoor seats, its not too hot (at night) and quite quiet. Interesting food choices, plenty of Singapore-infused style food. The soy cured tuna was really good. Beverages choices was good too. Although all the food are on the slighter more expensive side
5
Had my wedding anniversary dinner there and the food was awesome. So was their service and dessert. Definitely worth a visit on a special occassion
5
We ordered from the ala carte menu and the dishes were innovative and of good quality. The service was also very prompt and friendly.
5
We went on a weekday lunch and the ambience was awesome. The service was fast and food was delicious. The portions are tad small so you would want to get a salad main and desert for a complete meal :)
4
Great food presentation. Nice service and wonderfull ambience. Will go again and recommend friends..
5
I am pleasantly surprised when the restaurant texted me 30mins(I think) that the location was raining and be prepared; that is a thoughtful reminder. I am very pleased. üòä
5
I love the atmosphere, the weather, feel like u are having lunch in the forest, its different than others place in Singapore
5
Kudos to Halia for their excellent and personal service, in particular Raja and Edwin whom are attentive and ensuring we have a good time at Halia. The food is delicious and the portion is decent huge. Ambience is beautiful. Thanks again to the team for the planning of our birthday celebration.
4
Family‚Äôs first time to The Halia for a double birthday celebration. Beautiful restaurant. A+ service - From my first call abt cake to the WhatsApp from Siti and our last min table requests dealt with flawlessly. Our servers Raja/Maru were extremely attentive and Raja gave us a great recommendation to try the commune menu so we could try all their best dishes. Inventive food and lovely desserts. Bonus live jazz was magical
2
We went for a date night on Friday. Ordered their famous chilli crab spaghetti. There was no visible crab meat and the spaghetti sauce tasted more like a curry then chilli crab. We ordered glass noodles with prawns salad and the noodles were raw and dressing very sweet we couldn‚Äôt finish the food it was so bad.
4
There were 3 of us at lunch. My husband had the paper wrapped halibut which he enjoyed very much, our friend had the charred caesar salad which she also thought was very good. I had the lemongrass prawn salad which was iffy. It was generally a good idea but the salad tasted musty and there was too much sauce although the taste was the right degree of tanginess. The prawns were fresh and had a nice lemak taste but the sauce over-whelmed everything. I had the berry mint tea is one of the nicer fusion teas but the glass was so small that for $7 is was rather ridiculous. The menu gives choices from light to heavy meals so it's good for a group of picky eaters. The prices are a bit steep at $20 average for the quantity. Overall it's an OK choice especially if you want to sit outside near the greenery
5
Great service from 2 lovely ladies - Alice & Mary! Nice chilli crab pasta but not so nice chocolate dessert. Overall for service 5/5 and 3/5 for food. Would recommend to friends to come again :)
5
One word to describe this place ‚ÄúAMAZING‚Äù from the place to the food to the staff. Special thanks to Dennis Castro, Troung, Chan and the rest of the staff! thank u guys. I will definitely come back here again.
4
Second time here. Good dinner, great atmosphere. Managed to switch us to a table outside which was much better.
4
Dived in here to avoid heavy showers and although busy I was quickly found a table in the non-ac area which was lovely. I had read about the specials but as it was weekend the focus was on brunch. Beautifully served and very enjoyable while watching the rain teem down on the greenery outside
3
Service staff was indifferent and cannot care less. Food was good though. It is a pity as the ambience in the garden was so ideal
5
Was attended mainly by Dennis Castro! According to Dennis, it was a rare night that the restaurant was quiet! Lovely ambience surrounded by nature & lots of greens! Recommend sitting at the non-air conditioned section during cooling weather :) Ordered totally based on Dennis' recommendations the Lemongrass & ginger prawn salad, paperbag oven-baked halibut fillet, chilli crab spaghetti, sticky toffee pudding, banana & almond drink and mint berry drink! Spending about $58+ per person for 2 of us. EVERY dish was so good. My favourite being the Halibut fillet which was so tender with delicious broth & rice. Dennis's service was great! He was warm, friendly, knowledgeable and experienced! He shared many interesting things with us, and we also learnt that Halia's current executive chef is from Ireland. Would definitely return with my family to try other dishes on the menu. I also think its a wonderful place for celebrations/functions/weddings. 900m walk from Tanglin gate near Gleneagles Hospital
4
Our 6th visit and always look forward to the next! The servers are always attentive. Knowledgeable and able to recommend menu for first timers. The Caesar salad is a must! Delicious, refreshing and a perfect start to any meal. The rest of the menu is just perfect, with something for everyone. You cannot go wrong with any dish. Fantastic selection of drinks and finish off your meal with divine desserts. The die die must have chocolate is truly to die for! The chocolate comes with a perfect pairing of raspberry sorbet. To top is all, you are dining surrounded by lush garden‚Ä¶..
5
Had lunch in Halia, no reservations allowed for Sunday brunch but was really quick to get a table for two. We had Raja who served us, and he was so enthusiastic About his work, attentive and knew the menu very well. Lucky for us first-timers. Food was good and presentAble and service was excellent. Nice ambience. Would recommend for dates if you don‚Äôt want to look like you‚Äôre trying to hard, just let the service and food impress your partner . Happy tummy happy us! 
5
The Halia was a delight. Entirely healthy foods in the middle of the beautiful Botanical Gardens. Highly recommend their banana smoothie made with almost milk, the cold porridge and definitely must try their ginger pineapple jelly. Service from our waitress Tan was delightful. You can‚Äôt go wrong here. Thank you Halia
5
my friend booked this place as a birthday surprise for me, I loved the ambience as well the food. They were very nice with carrying out the plans that my friend suggested/planned with them. Also, a special thanks to Raja, a staff working there for coordinating the entire Birthday surprise dinner on behalf of my friend. I genuinely liked the dinner, the portion as well as the service provided by the staff members. They had a lighted up smiley face despite the late hour! and not forgetting their excellent service with constantly ensuring we were having a nice dinner
5
Was greeted by a very friendly and helpful staff, Tao Ka, Dennis. She gave an excellent service, surprised my boyfee w a birthday song and candle! Managed to explain the dishes very well and helping us choose the best dish to our taste buds!!
5
Lovely restaurant with an interesting menu and lovely staff. We stayed for hours as it poured with rain and our main waitress Alice was utterly sweet and charming.
5
Happened to stop for drink and spot of lunch and what an excellent place.
Service fantastic. Lovely choice of drinks and cocktails-non alcoholic. Food was very well presented, and very delicious.
Waitress Alice Lim was very helpful.
Highly recommended
4
The food is good, with a nice blend of herbs. The chicken breast was surprisingly really tender and the dishes we ordered were flavourful
3
Had the halibut main course with Japanese rice. But the rice is hardly Japanese, with the grain still hard. Is it meant to be like that or was the rice only semi-cooked?
4
Food and service was fantastic, thanks to Raja & Arnel. Location is very cosy. Overall 4 stars for The Halia üëçüèª
5
My friends and I opted for the communal dining and we were glad we did. It allowed us to try a variety of food including desserts! The wagyu rump was the best!
5
Excellent ambience. Varied selection of food choices and could add a bit more for tea time e.g. sandwiches. Service was very good.
5
Warm welcome by friendly staff. Beautiful place to dine. Strongly recommend for nature lovers. Staff were very accommodating and service was excellent. Scrumptious food with good portion. Special credit to Staff Raja for the reservation and preparation for my best friend's birthday surprise. He made a good choice of seat allocation and tasty dessert too. Kudos! :-) Would highly recommend for a pleasant dine-in
5
I alsways go here to take my herbal tea, listen to the birds and girt by the tropical rainforrest. Here I am served by the charming Dennis Castro and his excellent trained and welcoming staff. A balm for the soul!Lars √Öke Nilsson - "Mr Okay"member of the World Travelllers Clu
4
After walking around the gardens early in the morning to escape the heat we stopped here for a late breakfast. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. Lovely setting, although fountains can be a little noisy!
5
Had a wonderful time celebrating a birthday. The ambience was perfect for us and service was top notch. Special mention to the male Indian waiter who gave us excellent service and gave a solid recommendation as to what to order. Will definitely visit again.
5
Location is easily accesible. Ambience is lovely. Our server Truong was really knowledgable about the food and drinks and he recommended the best dishes that my wife and me ever tried. Will surely come again!
3
We had good, friendly service from our waitress Alice Lim, and would still recommend this restaurant if visiting the gardens, but since we last visited, the management have made it ‚ÄòHalal‚Äô, so no more proper cocktails, (though the ‚Äòmocktails‚Äô were nice enough), and the place just doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äòbuzz‚Äô it did before. Whilst the salads we ordered were tasty, the portion size has got smaller and the chilli crab dip had been overheated and blistered the roof of my mouth!Overall it was pleasant but disappointing that somewhere we loved on past occasions has become ‚Äòsober‚Äô in atmosphere as well as religious observance
4
We had a delicious lunch after spending the morning walking in the gardens on a very hot and humid day. We had the set menu 2 course lunch which was reasonably priced and very tasty. Soup and a roll followed by steak with peppercorn sauce fries and salad for me and chilli crab spaghetti for my husband with coffee/tea included in the deal. We were served by Alice who was so friendly
5
We took a long walk from the MRT to the restaurant n thankfully we were greeted with warm smiles from the staffs.Love the ambience and out of city feel there. The place is clean. Do take note it does take a while for the food to arrive however the taste of the food beats it. Food is tasty and delicious. My wife had Halia's Style Chilli Crab Spaghetti while I had Slow Cooked Tender Chicken Breast and Braised Thigh Potato Gratin for our main dish. Ginger Garden and Yuzu Gateaux for dessert were awesome! They even decorated the plate to wish us on our anniversary. Overall the service and food is outstanding. Enjoyed our dinner there. Thank you The Halia
3
4 people . 3 different dish was ordered and mine was bad and the 2 others a disappointment. But the service was great. I ordered a mashpotato and that was okay :) won't come back for the food. But the starter was great. Something with chees
4
Took the Communal Dining set for 6 pax and realised that the servings for each dish is the same as it is for 1 person. Granted there are quite a number of dishes but a single chicken breast to be shared between 6 people is very small. I think the price could be higher so that the servings are larger as it is something shared. Apart from that, the food tasted really good
4
AS it rains a LOT in Singapore, one is always looking for a place to get out of it for awhile. The Halia is a great place to do that while visiting the Botanical Gardens. We visited the gardens and went through the Orchid Gardens area ...all during the rain...no problem, just bring an umbrella. We came out of the Orchid Garden and there was The Halia. It wasn't busy that day and we got a nice table outside and had lemon tea while waiting for our salads. My partner had a tomato and veggie salad that he really liked while I had the shrimp with cellophane noodles with greens and a great fruity dressing. I really liked it and would have it again. It was nice to come out of an attraction like the Orchid Garden and sit down in a nice restaurant with good service and good food. No, nothing special but, very good
5
I organized a baby shower for my friend, and even though I can't make reservations on Sundays, Mae and Maru made sure that we had enough seats at the al fresco area :) the food is good too! the restaurant better promote Mae as I haven't met someone so exceptional :)
5
Awesome food with amazing attentive staff. you guys made the day for us. The lamb rack was juicy tender and sweet. My
girlfriend liked the Halia chilli crab legs spaghetti. Great romantic ambiance.
Thank you guys!
5
Nice and perfectly prepared fresh food. Friendly service and great Ambiente in the Botanic Gardens..
5
Inside the botanical gardens close to the ginger garden. Lovely menu in a perfect place, do not miss the ginger based dishes.
5
Never disappoint. The food is awesome. The service is top notch. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
5
Excellent service by Tao Ha & Raja. Food served ;like it to be warmer if possible. Taste of dish Ambience is nice but good if there is a barrier(leafy plants) to separate the view of diners seated next to the glass panel. Outdoor Romantic diners cannot be lovey dovey if they receive attention from indoor diners next to them.This is badly needed. I love the food Will be back again
5
We had a birthday dinner for 9 friends; and it was a perfect combination of good food, warm service and lovely ambience. It was our first time here and we must say we enjoyed every dish served. Loved the fresh Lemongrass & Ginger Prawn Salad, Fresh Boston Bay Mussel (its broth tastes a lil like lemak cili), Chilli Crab Dip (pretty legit); and the mains were tasty too esp the Pan Fried Barramudi (crispy skin, and juicy flesh :)) and the chilli crab spaghettini. Wasn't a fan of the Paperbag oven-baked halibut - the fillet was a lil too dry, I thought. Ok, desserts ! Star item was Sticky Toffee Pudding (absolutely love the texture and that it wasnt too sweet or swimming in sauce). "The ginger garden" and "Ginger spice, all things nice" - well, nice and refreshing. And then there was "Die die must have chocolate", which was quite a bomb next to the pudding.We would also like to thank the staff who was serving us throughout the evening - for being patient with the bunch, and taking the pains to explain every item in detail, and made really good recommendations. Appreciate her eye for detail and was very attentive as well. Thank you, TAO HA! It was the first for all of us. But for most, it definitely won't be the last
5
Enjoyed a great lunch at the Halia while waiting out some rain during my visit to the wonderful botanical gardens. Really nice atmosphere and great service by Alicelim and the rest of the team. I went for the 3 course lunch set (pumpkin soup, chicken breast and ginger spice as desert), all of which tasted really great. After lunch I staid around reading a book with some nice tea
5
We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary at The Halia. The food was amazing. Both our lamb and wagyu were melt in your mouth tender. No wonder there wasn‚Äôt any steak knives! You didn‚Äôt need them at all! Service was fantastic, ambiance gorgeous. As the sun set and the evening dinner crowd turned, it got pretty romantic. The sticky toffee pudding was out of this world, oh my!
2
Visited Halia for brunch on Saturday (around 3pm). The location and ambience is excellent, service quite prompt too but sadly the food was lacking! When we were placing our order, we were informed that they are out of poached eggs and beef. This rules out about 70% of their brunch menu - not only is this quite strange for someone advertising all day brunch (which is on the expensive and upscale side), but we were not even informed till we asked for specific dishes containing those items.The food was reasonably prompt but was quite disappointing - the bread was burnt yet cold, and food in general lacked seasoning. Coffee and other drinks were actually great but needless to say, we won't be returning here
5
My boyfriend and I visited after spending the morning in the garden. Alice was a wonderful server and gave great suggestions on menu items (highly recommend the chilli crab spaghetti!) The ambiance is really unique, situated on the edge of the orchid garden in a lush grove of foliage
5
A perfect location for a family dinner to start the new year. Jad dinner on 1st Jan 2018. The staff were friendly and provided suggestion on the menu. Food was superb.
4
The place was slightly remote but their food and service were pretty decent. Mussels is a must-try dish!
4
I was impressed by the quality of the food and the creativity of the dishes.
The place was quite noisy (group of people).
5
I went to the Halia for my boyfriend birthday celebration. Since I‚Äôm from KL, i just emailed them for the birthday surprise that I would like to make and amazingly they managed to surprise my boyfriend and I.Thanks the Halia and team
4
Botanical garden being my ever favorite place in Singapore I decided to go to Halia for my birthday dinner with my husband. The panfried barramundi was tottaly worth every dollar spent. The Rump steak however was chewy and not upto my expectation. We finished the dinner on a high note with amazing Ginger spice, and all things nice
5
Stopped in to the Halia after a day walking around the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Set amongst the gardens, it's the perfect place to rest your feet and try some great food. Great range of options on the menu, from Western to Asian fusion and a nice take on Singapore's famous chili crab. Nice to also see the "ginger" theme cleverly carried through to a lot the menu. Service was fast and staff attentive and friendly. Had a great chat with our waiter, Truong, who was knowledgeable about the food and made sure we were looked after
3
Food quality is good. Floor staffs are attentive. There are so many available tables but when I ask for another table the front desk decline my request telling me all are reserved but after an hour plus later they are still available. My table is dirty with ants all over even though the floor staffs wipe twice. Until I insist a change of table for third time then she finally give in to my request 
4
+ great interior, ambience and music+ interesting menu (only had drinks)+ exceptional service from Alice Lim- bad service once from a waiter (Malay name): no smile, seemed to be annoyed to serve us... as if this is a restaurant that caters only for tourists- ladies at the front jump immediately to ask where you are going (there is a sign behind with ‚Äòoutside food forbidden‚Äô or sth); restaurant of this kind should be more positive and opening to their guest
4
First visit: Birthday treat from adult children, Sunday lunchNo reservations accepted for weekends and found out that only brunch menu available. We did not have to wait too long for table for six, although the place was full. Recommended by TH to have steak of the day for my spouse and I, rather than having two different steak options, which turned out to be a good choice. As this took sometime, we were advised to have some sides; we opted for fries and mesclun salad. The menu was limited but interesting; and so were the drinks. All in all; enjoyable.2nd visit: Saturday brunch; my treat for all-girls; Mum and two older sisters.different dishes; laksa, beef/mushroom, full breakfast, and two other items. Served attentively by TH again. Both occasions: seated indoors, as singapore‚Äôs midday heat,humidity not too welcome. Food: Go for western options as these were more satisfying; Asian fusion as the name suggest, won‚Äôt go down well with traditionalists.Service: TH was attentive and gave good recommendations.Price: on the higher side, but hey, you are eating in a restaurant situated within a UNESCO heritage site.Verdict: will come again but reserved for special occasions and for the weekday menu. Be prepared to wait for food
4
I dined here over two consecutive nights - the first night with my family and the second night with friends. Between us, we had the following dishes: paperbag halibut; chilli crab spaghettini; panfried barramundi; slow cooked chicken with braised thigh potato gratin; potato fries, sauteed spinach and mushrooms; ginger prawn salad; charred Caesar salad; die die chocolate; sticky toffee pudding.The highlights of the two dinners for me were the ginger prawn salad, the potato gratin that came with the slow cooked chicken and the desserts. Apart from these particular dishes that I tried and liked, I think it was the overall ambience and service of the restaurant that were the main drawing points for me. Based on this, I would return during the day time to try their special drinks (herbarium) and other desserts
5
Loved our dinner, barramundi was excellent. Romantic atmosphere. Lovely to dine with trees and flowers all around.
5
Ambience was perfect and the place is cooling and relaxing. Staff was great and service was efficient. Good for couples who want to have a nice dinner during the weekend after a long week.
5
Birthday celebration, nice ambience in the gardens, live band, good food and service. Very enjoyable!
3
Unless you love long walks and dark pathways, take a cab to the Halia. Food was great but the portion is not meant for sharing. Paper bag halibut is a beauty.
5
Was late for my reservation and they made no fuss about it. Food and service was excellent. Would recommend to couples or small families.
5
Enjoy your meal in garden with nice food and fantastic service. Alice Lim service-lady will give you a good choice and best service. If you come to singapore and looking for the halal food, this is the right place and unmissable!
5
Fabulous food, amazing ambience, superb service! Second trip to Halia. They still wow-ed, surprised and delivered!
3
Food took an hour to arrive. Restaurant was not at full capacity but did not seem to be able to cope
5
My husband and I went there for dinner last night. The service from Tao Thi Ha was fabulous! She was attentive, polite and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was really lovely, as was the ambience and mocktails! We order the smoked kingfish, prawn noodle salad, and grilled prawns. All dishes were really excellent, light and tasty. It was such a pleasant experience that we came back for breakfast the next day!The breakfast is not bad. The weekday breakfast is not as comprehensive as the weekend breakfast. There was no sausage, ham or bacon available. The only meat dish was chilli crab eggs which was lovely or Nasi Lemak with beef which we didn't try. Would like the restaurant to consider adding more meat options for breakfast on weekdays please. The service is okay for breakfast. We sat in the aircon area for dinner and then the outside area under some very effective fans. I felt more relaxed in the outdoor area with this fans and closer to the lovely trees and plants. Lots of cute squirrels jumping between tree branches. This is a lovely cafe and I'm glad it's at the Botanical Gardens for both locals and tourists to enjoy.
5
First time coming to this place after it became officially halal.The ambience is nice and cozy with lots of greeneries surrounding the restaurant.The smoked salmon we chose for appetizer was so delicious.I ordered the cucumber & basil drink and the paperbag halibut for my main meal.No regrets at all for ordering
5
Staff very friendly..food excellent the service fast n effcient.
And Alice lim very helpful since i bring my twins grandson/daughter .
5
Alice was a fun hostess, she was attentive and efficient. The restaurant was very good and has a very nice ambience. Definitely a worthy visit
4
The food was nice. Ambience was good. Staff was friendly and service was prompt.
Order a oven baked halibut with Japanese rice. It was better expected.
My friend ordered a crab spaghetti. Taste was quite normal but the crab meat was generous
5
Superb ambience and food. The food we ordered were delectable. Portion was just right. The staff were attentive to the guest dining at the restaurant. Pleasant experience.
4
Went there for a team dinner. Ordered the communal menu. Spread and portion was good. The salad and toffee pudding was AWESOME.
The staff serving us wasn't the best, but was not bad either. Average.
Overall, still a good experience.
4
Went there with 5 other people on a Thurs night with reservation at 7pm. The Halia provided clear directions & the menu 1 day ahead of it. Service was good, we took the communal menu which was served promptly & tasted great. But felt pressurized slightly as they needed to clear the table as soon as the next dish is present. Wagyu beef, chilli crab spaghetti, paperbag baked halibut & sticky date pudding deserve special mention.Place is unfortunately inaccessible for those who dont own a car, & especially at night, takes a while before Uber/Grab arrives. It‚Äôs about $10 more from the Tyersall gate & I dont recommend walking to the Botanic Gardens MRT station in the pitch darkness (about 15min, with not much lighting). Nevertheless, I wld encourage everyone to try it because of its ambience & good food
4
The service was decent. However, I did request for a table with a nicer view due to our special day which was not provided. :( It is easy to make a reservation with Chope.Food selection was good and priced slightly higher (given that it is in Botanical Gardens). We had 2 mains and 3 side dishes which set us back to about SGD150. All of the dishes was spot on, with exception of the mussels which we find slightly salty. Do not waste money on the drinks. My SGD5 green tea was a miserly cup or lukewarm water with a tea bag (they provide iced water).I would not come here for a normal meal with the family
3
It was quite difficult to locate the restaurant from the Nassim entrance through botanical garden with limited signs pointing to the restaurant.the ambience is considered dark despite we were there for lunch.we took the set lunch which was normal given the reviews.staff was not attentive to details too
5
Had our company dinner here having our Boss that came from UK we are worried that the food might not to his liking BUT guess what THE HALIA food managed to impressed my boss with theor food and dessert. We took the set meal for 4..the portion was right we even had hard time finishing the food..Unique dessert impressed our Boss the most. Go for it the price i can say..it's just right!
5
We didn't make any reservation but decided to have lunch there around 12:00noon. The waitress is so kind and sweet and found us a table almost immediately. The have lunch set as options but we ordered A La Carte. Dishes are very tasty yet pricewise is higher than set lunch. it's around 50 singapore dollars per person if you don't order expensive wine or the premium steak. After all, as a local, I would highly recommand it to native friends or foreign visitors. Cheers
5
Great Food & Great Ambience..a bit noisy because of side table gathering with a group of people..after all Value for $$$$
4
Great food, nice atmosphere. Really friendly staff who accomodated my fussy eating habits! Thanks Dennis and Aiden for a lovely lunch!
3
The ambiance is nice for small group gathering. Food portion is not very big and price is slightly high.
1
Ordered the potato fries, lemongrass & ginger prawn salad and chilli crab spagetthini. All of the food came together.. Shouldn‚Äôt it be starters followed by main course first?! Basic F&B service, please. Potato fries was alright, lemongrass & ginger salad makes use of frozen prawns. How classy?! $16 salad which uses frozen prawn?!.Chili crab spaghettini is like eating a plate full of sugar. Clearly never listened to PM‚Äôs speech on cutting down on sugar! If you‚Äôre into diabetes, then you‚Äôll like this. Drinks cost $5-7 for tiny glass! How tiny is tiny? imagine 2 x vitagen drink content. Seriously?! Taking full advantage of the opportunity cost here. Oh die die must have chocolate cake? Yes! I died thinking how in the world you call that a chocolate cake when it‚Äôs a chocolate mousse! The size? Tiny as hell too. Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind paying for food that are expensive if they are delicious but not when they are pricey and not delicious at all. So go there if you have too much money to spare or you wanna impress your date (who has Low blood sugar level) with this non- main stream dining place.

I took the set: good sized portions but the chicken wasn't the most succulent - perhaps 'sou vide' for too long? The soup was unremarkable. The nougatine dessert was inventive. Probably take the ala carte the next time.The service was haphazard and the servers looked under pressure = very uncool
5
Love this restaurant for its great food, ambience and excellent service especially by Alice. We had the 3 course set lunch which came with a soup, main, dessert and coffee/tea. I especially loved the desserts. If you are looking at somewhere unique, relaxing with great food and service, this is the place! By the time we finished lunch, it started to rain. We were pleasantly surprised they provided us with complimentary disposable ponchos ! Will be back again and this time for dinner to experience this lovely place at night. If you are driving, car park via Tyersall Ave and from the car park it is only a 2 min walk. Of course while there, explore the Orchid garden and our beautiful botanic garden

It was a great choice to have our group dinner at Halia Restaurant on 25 November 2017. Before the dinner, i took a good look around this supposedly well known "a restaurant in a garden or a garden in a restaurant".The main dining hall has high ceiling with full glass walls that gives diners unobstructed views of the Ginger Garden. It has an Al Fresco dining area surrounded by the greenery. The Restaurant was very busy with wedding dinner function , full with diners and a group of us in a Private Dining Room. The service staff are very attentive & efficient, food is great and we had a wonderful dining experience at Halia Restaurant . Would certainly recommend it !!
5
It was our second visit and did not disappoint. The food was excellent--we particularly enjoyed the tuna ceviche appetizer and the barramundi dish. Loved the desserts, too, especially the ginger-based dessert and the toffee pudding. The setting is one of the best features--in the middle of the Botanic Gardens near the Orchid Garden. It's quiet and peaceful and generally a great place for a romantic dinner or an opportunity to meet up with friends and have a real conversation
4
Two of us came here at 12 pm for lunch without a reservation and was fortunate to get a table in the air-conditioned room. We took the two course set lunch which costs $33 after taxes. It includes soup of the day (sweet potatoes and celery) and a small bun. Request for extra bun is chargeable. There are three choices for the mains-fish, chicken and a vegetarian choice. Coffee or tea is included
4
Tucked away in Botanical garden, the restaurant is surrounded by lush greenery...nice ambience The food is good. We went there during a sat morning. They only serve the brunch menu on weekends. A bit pricey but the food was good.Would recommend the Halia breakfast or Beans on Toast.Friendly staff
4
Lovely spot to eat while in the gardens. Good food interesting selections of food and drinks. The portion was just right and eating outside with the greenery is nice. Staff were great and would go again.
5
Superb service! Great food with decent portion. Valued for money. Good food presentation. Staffs were very attentive.
4
Had the communal dinner which was generous for 4 people. The standouts were the beautiful lush surroundings, their botanical drinks, the fries, lemongrass & ginger prawn salad and their desserts. Great place to escape an otherwise stifling environment wherever you may be on this island.
1
Booked 30 people for a pleasant evening meal. The only positive thing is the nearby botanical garden. Meal was forgettable and poor. Service abysmal and they could care less about the customer. Tables not set up as asked; they argued. Then they served ‚Äúfamily style‚Äù dishes for each table (nice concept) but NOT ENOUGH PORTIONS ON THE PLATES FOR EACH PERSON!!! For instance, at our table of 8 people, they served a basket with 4 rolls only and a chicken dish with only 6 pieces!!! When we complained, they only brought more portions for some of the food AND THEN CHARGED US EXTRA ON THE BILL. So we paid extra just to have one portion per person, when they knew exactly how many people we were going to be. The waiters and waitresses were totally disinterested during the meal and the manager at the end totally unapologetic. You could see that customer satisfaction was the LAST thing on his mind. See the botanical gardens and stay away from the 2 restaurants in the park (same management and kitchen). By the way, food quality was only average. Nothing special and certainly nothing memorable except the bad experience.
4
A long walk works up a craving once you've trekked through the Botanical Gardens and reach the restaurant. The ambiance is rustic and cozy, the service was immaculate with a smile and the food was definitely worth the money. Had the Spicy Chilli Crab Spaghettini and the Halibut with rice and the flavors were rich and sumptuous. A must try, if you manage to find your way from Botanic Gardens MRT Station
5
Aside from the pleasant ambience and the delicious cuisine served @The Halia, the impeccable service was certainly the main highlight of the night. Had dropped a message the day before on the possibility to include the words "Happy Birthday" on the dessert ordered and the request was met beyond expectation coupled with an unexpected birthday song! Thumbs up to our hosts for the evening - Ms Chan Myae Thet and Mr Dennis Castro (: My partner and I certainly had an enjoyable evening.
4
A group us dined here for a family birthday. We ordered from the communal menu that served 6 people (a 4 person option also available). Lots of food but unfortunately the portions were off. There shouldn't be just 4 pieces of bread for 6 people or beef cut for five. Seemed odd but can't fault the service or food quality
5
Great food, fantastic customer service by our kabayan, Dennis Castro. We didn‚Äôt know what to order so we just asked him what was their most requested and popular dishes. He suggested for us to try the ones with crab and halibut. Good choice. Love the ambiance of the place, as well, so relaxing.
4
We spent a good few hours in the Botanic Gardens and we had researched places to eat. From looking at their website we also knew that they did a fixed price menu at lunchtime.When we arrived at the restaurant it was very busy and we could not see the fixed price menu displayed. We asked the lady on reception and she said they were doing the fixed price lunch and soon found us a table.The lunch was very good, we had a sweet potato and carrot soup to start. Main course was pan fried barramundi in a creamy sauce with asparagus and sun dried tomato served with rice. I had the ginger garden dessert which was excellent. We both had a "botanical" drink each and I had a coffee.The restaurant is very pleasant and the service was very good. The bill was 90 dollars which we thought was good value. Great place to take a break if visiting the gardens and have a relaxing lunch
5
I was there for my birthday dinner with my Fiancee. We were served by Tao Ha, who is friendly, cheerful and very forthcoming. Recommened us good cuts of meat and attended to all our needs during our time there. Both of us enjoyed our time there and would like to commend Tao Ha for the excellent service.
4
Great atmosphere and relaxing mood.
Went there because I needed halal food. It was not an extensive meal, and the waiter did not come around often, but aside from that it was a wonderful atmosphere.
5
We love the ambience and atmosphere. Some food are not available. Dessert are very delicious. Staff are friendly and very forthcoming.
5
Very nice place just inside the botanical gardens. Kind staff and great offering of drinks and food.
3
We have an Average dining experience.
The Food presentation is good, had the lemongrass prawn salad, Chilli crab spaghettini and lychee&thyme. the taste was ok.
5
the ambience and setting was cosy and the food was delicious and enjoyed the portions as well. the staff, Dennis, Edwin and Rovie were friendly, approachable and made my birthday celebrations and enjoyable and memorable one. Thank you!
4
Chanced upon this restaurant in the Botanic Gardens. Great food best Chilli Crab Spaghetti ever. And others enjoyed the Bara‚Äô. Pleasant service and great location. Thanks to Tao Ka for looking after us. Now on our list of top ten in Singapore.
5
If you plan to visit the Botanical Gardens make sure you book a table with a terrace view in this restaurant. The food and service are delightful. Lovely setting and a wonderful place to eat, so tranquil and so tasty!
5
The location of Halia is at the Botanical Gardens near the National Orchid garden and the Ginger Garden at the Botanic Gardens. It is easily reached by the MRT and then following the signs in the garden for the Orchid Garden, a pleasant walk of about 3 kilometers. I had the Singapore Chili Crab Spaghettini which I had previously enjoyed at their restaurant in Hanoi. It is a bit spicy but tastes so good. Service is provided courteously and relatively quickly. I had a short wait to be seated but was well worth it
5
First time at Halia. Have always walked by but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the chance to try until now. Service was great, Dennis was very helpful throughout and recommended good dishes to us, especially the steak of the day. Probably one of the better steaks I have had. Seared well and interestingly served with a lemon, which turned out to be a delightful surprise. Would definitely return for the service and food.
5
Kudos to all staffs especially Alice Lim and Mary. They were very friendly and helpful and took the initiative to sing a birthday song for my wife. Overall food was great and ambience was calming. Though the food came a bit late but the taste made up for it. Probably the preparation was tip top
5
Alice Lim was our server and she took great care of us. Love the coffees and the muffin. Cool atmosphere and relaxing stop on the way to the Orchid Gardens.
4
Staff was very friendly, the ambiance was great. The food was good, highly recommend the chilli crab spaghetti.
5
Food was undeniably good and coupled with excellent service (we were served by Dennis Castro), will definitely be coming back. Thank you, Dennis!
4
Very pretty and comfortable restaurant in the botanic gardens. We had the set lunch menu which is very good value for money. All three courses were delicious, in particular the main course of pan fried barramundi in coconut cream orzo with perfectly sweet asparagus. Unfortunately the service lets the restaurant down. It is very slow, and they only had one guy making drinks which meant we didn't get our mocktail until after the first course was cleared away. Improve that and I would give it an excellent
5
My wife & I called into The Halia at Singapore Botanical Gardens eon Wednesday 22nd November. It was very busy, but the service was very good (special mention for Alice Lin who looked after us very efficiently). The menu is very extensive & food served promptly & reasonable price with regard to usual Singapore prices.
5
Came here many years back & just returned again for dinner. Had the lemongrass drink, chilli crab dip, sauteed mushrooms & spinach, seabass, and some pastry dish. Everything was delicious! Great service too, especially from the friendly Dennis. I had actually indicated in my online reservation that it was my friend's birthday & I thought the restaurant had forgotten about it but they didn't because the staff surprised us with a bday song when serving our dessert! Shall come back and try their brunch next
5
The food was amazing, I specially recommend the paper bag oven baked hallibut fillet as well as the panfried barramundi! The ambiance was nice too, keeping it casual in the middle of a beautiful location in the Singapore botanic garden, Alice was our waitress and did an excellent job as well. Highly recommended.
2
I went here on my own. I was here for lunch and wanted to have something light so opted for the cauliflower soup. It was tasteless, bland and very small. The bread that was served with it was dry and old. The cappuccino I ordered came after the soup and not before. The service was slow and I felt like I was out in a corner and not allowed to sit on the deck when I asked because I was alone and not a couple.Would not recommend this place and will not come back
5
I went with a friend on a week night. The taxi dropped us at the Tanglin Gate and we had to walk to the restaurant. Arrived hot and sweaty but it was worth it!The restaurant was busy and since we did not have prior reservation we were seated at the terrace. The Goji Berry Infusion and the Halia Mint Berry drinks tasted heavenly after our trek. Compliments to the staff who patiently explained the dishes to us. As we are not big eaters, we had the Lemongrass and Ginger Prawn Salad and the Puff Pastry Parcel. They were good. We enjoyed our dinner.Tip: Seat at the terrace to enjoy the garden ambience and the light breeze
3
The location was still good, being located inside the Botanic Gardens. Nice walk up to the restaurant.Once there, we were seated inside, it was very noisy. Service was slow and the food took a while to be served. The chicken breast I ordered was not fully cooked, the meat was still red. I informed the server who promptly removed the dish without any apology. I lost my appetite after that. He then offered to replace it with a new fully cooked chicken breast which I asked to takeaway.It's been almost 10 years since I've been back. Not a wow experience i'm afraid.
5
Food was great and a restaurant in a nature park, such a unique experience! Will definitely be here again
5
The staff were very helpful and informative, and the food was amazing. Just note that the outdoor seating has some mosquitoes, so might want to consider bringing insect repellent.
5
We had intended only having coffee here but when we saw the menu we decided to have an early lunch! Delicious food and coffee plus great service.
5
A lovely setting in the heart of the botanic gardens, atmosphere and excellent food.
Ryan and Dennis were so helpful and made our experience memorable. Louise from UK
4
Baramundi at the Botanical Gardens, only in Singapore! I'm from the states, and have very low expectations expectations of food at this type of venue. Very surprised by an excellent menu, quality of the food, value for the price and friendly service thanks to Alice.
5
My wife and I decided to have lunch here to kill time while waiting out one of Singapore‚Äôs famous thunderstorms and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier we did. Our waitress, Alice, and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly and attentive the entire time. I have no doubt this will probably be the best dining experience at a botanical garden I‚Äôll ever have in my life both in terms of quality and service. If you are spending the day at the botanical gardens, I would absolutely recommend a meal here.
4
Had a lovely dinner at The Halia! Nice atmosphere, good service especially by waiter mr Raja, and good food. Desserts are better than the mains in my opinion, and the teas and blends and unique. Enjoyed the chilli crab dip as a starter which came with prawn crackers!
5
Went there for farewell lunch with my colleague. Was served by the wonderful staff, Dennis and the food is so full of flavour and everything is perfectly cooked.The spaghettini may need to be shared unless you really love chilli crab but the prawn salad is so refreshing
4
The Halia at the Singapore Botanic Gardens located at the UNESCO site is a great place to have a nice meal. Both indoor and alfresco seating are available and we enjoyed the Jazz band very much. Food was good too with sufficient service levels, although it didnt start off as well, for some reasons, but glad it did get better as the night went on. Point to note, it requires a little bit of walking to get to the restaurant and if you're driving, do get the right route as there are 2 ways to get there and one of it was closed due to some works when I was there.
4
We ran into Halia as we were trying to escape from the torrential rain that was pooring down at the Botanic Gardens. Was a lovely little haven and a bit quirky. Had an interesting twist on a caesar type salad with duck slices and pan fried lettuce? Who knew you could do that? Anyway all in all very pleasant. I went with my father. our waitress Alice was nice and very smiley. All in all a nice place. Also it is halal which we didn't initially realise but the lovely interesting juices made up for the lack of wine with lunch
4
We went there for lunch, the meals were very delicious, their service was excellent (Dennis Castro), and also they provided a prayer room!
Would recommend to try this at least once.
4
The service was great. Helpful and friendly staff especially from Dennis Castro. Food was also great especially the mussels dish and the unique cumin ginger drink! Will definitely dine at The Halia again. Thanks to my bestfriend for taking me here on my birthday!
5
We had a great meal here,the service was great and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough ,the menu was extensive and reasonably priced
5
Splendid service from Alice & Rayan. Friendly and welcoming. Good food recommendation and lovely ambience. üëåüèΩ
5
I went there with my girlfriend and we booked a table pretty late. Yet the service was excellent and the staff serving us was amazing! He was so polite and we had a great conversation. And to our surprise, he was the manager of the restaurant, namely Mr Dennis Castro! Really really enjoyed our time there as he was sucha great host and he even recommended the perfect dessert to end our night! Thanks Dennis, and hopefully we see you again when we come to Halia restaurant in the future!
4
The atmosphere is very nice as it is in the heart of Botanical Garden. I feel like it is very complementing the dining experience, as if I was in a jungle. The food was nice. We bought the 6 person set. I really like the appetizer and the salad is to die for. Main course for me is good, but the pasta can be more interesting. Otherwise the rest is night. Also Dennis is very good and helpful. He explains everything in an orderly manner and brings a very happy upbringing, which is always nice
5
Was there for a late lunch and dessert. The service was great and food was more than decent. We had their prawn salad, steak, saute mushrooms (a little too salty but still very good) and raspberry sorbet with chocolate (the name was kinda ambiguous and not too impressive - but man was i glad i got this dessert!
4
I have been here couple of times, once for team outing lunch, and once on a date lunch.Both times, we tried the set lunch menu and they are really good and value for money. And I do not mean just from a quantity perspective - the ingredients taste fresh and the food is delicious. Of course, the surroundings make it unique. Given it's housed in the Botanics you get a lot more of greenery environment (it's has outside seating) and along with the lunch, it's not a bad thing. Definitely the place to go, if you are visiting Botanics.PS : They also do weeding receptions, I went to a friends' weeding once here - again,l very good food
5
Have a great lunch at halia restaurant at botanic gardenWe orderred slow cooked chicken breast so yummy and two of my kids love it so much that made us to make another order.Drinks are very refreshing with some delicious herbal like ginger, lemon put in it.Food n drinks helps your day after long walking in the garden. @alice the waitress is really helpful. When i need to go to toliet she help to look after kids.We will come back
5
Celebrating my man birthday. Service from the waiter/waitress is very helpful and explain the food plan to order. He even make the recommendation for 1st dining with Halia. Food is in big portion. We end up cannot finish. The birthday sang by the crew makes my man so pleased and surprised. Appreciate all the efforts from the crew and will come again on a different occasion for dinner
5
Excellent food and very attentive staff! We went there in a big group and everyone was delighted with the service. We had the set lunches - excellent value for money! Thanks guys!
5
Halal Breakfast@Halia was a great decision we made to start our 5th Anniversary celebration! The food was of unique mix & delicious in the midst of natural garden setting. The service was also amazing - thanks Dennis Castro for the hospitality!
4
Very nice breakfast after morning walk. Especially enjoy the drink selection with herbs. Relaxing ambiance close to busy orchid garden.
4
Went for dinner. The food recommendations from the service team were great. They know the food on the menu. The food was exceptional surprisingly good! The air condition part of the restaurant was a little cramped thus it wasn‚Äôt very cosy.

After visiting the latest attraction last month, Learning Forest at Singapore Botanical Gardens, I decided to have an early lunch at Halia restaurant which was nearby to attraction. The restaurant wasn't crowded on the day I visited, less than three others in the queue but staff took more than 15 minutes to sit everyone.I ordered the 'soup of the day' and main course salmon pasta risotte. Instead of serving soup first as starter, waiter served me the main course. I then told waiter of 'missing soup of the day', he just simply looked at me without saying a word or even an apology. Instead, he went off straight back to kitchen. That was last I had seen the staff. The main course unappetizing, blend, saltish and lacked eye-appear. Probably, I had selected the wrong choice of meal. Next, when comes to payment, waitress came with bill and 'soup of the day' as complimentary. What an absurd gesture by waitress for kind of poor service recovery to a customer just to cover up for the restaurant mistake. I declined soup, paid the meal and left restaurant immediately.It was just another wrong choice of restaurant to have lunch. A restaurant that I found lacking in service quality, poor attention to customers requirements and warm. I don't expect such sub-standard service to happen coming from a restaurant located at famous Singapore Botanic Gardens. I must admit that I enjoyed more of the outdoor scenery, beautiful flowers in the gardens but not the service and food inside The Halia Restaurant.
4
Lovely starter of prawn salad and the dessert. The signature fish paperbag was somewhat of a let down. Due to the restaurant requirements, alcohol cannot be used on the fish. Which makes the dish less tasty. I figure if the chef can put some deep fried but very thinly sliced ginger, that may be able to help the dish. But the dessert was excellent. Well worth the price.
5
We stopped for a break walking through the gardens and had a lovely experience here. The herbal drinks were fabulous and the crab chilli dip was amazing. Alice, the beautiful lady that served us was sweet and friendly. A really nice spot for lunch and a break from the heat.
5
I was escorting a number of journalists and photographers to the orchid garden ahead of the visit of the uk royal family. They were pretty hot and desperate for someone cool to file their work. In a panic I spoke to Alice who was a star, opened up the indoors area, switched the aircon on and swiftly prepared cooling drinks.We all had a chance to relax and prepare for the princes arrival and felt we had the royal treatment from Alice and halia
3
This is my fifth trip to Singapore visiting family and I recall having had some truly memorable food at this restaurant on previous visits, so had no hesitation in dropping in for a late breakfast/brunch one weekday morning.The staff were helpful and friendly as previously, particularly in accommodating our two year old grandson. The food, however, was disappointing. The toast basket was exactly what it said, toast and some spreads. I ordered the fresh fruit, expecting a plate of mango, pineapple and kiwi,or similar. What arrived was a plastic tumbler containing chunks of melon, some dragon fruit (which I don't particularly like) and a few grapes (one of which was decidedly manky looking). I could have purchased better in my UK supermarket for much less. Compared to previous experiences, this was a disappointment and unlikely to take me back for another visit
5
Picturesque rest in the middle of the BG. We were having dinner tomaTos and basil soup and cesar salad. best of all was the great service offered by waiters Rovie and Dennis, whom we were able to ask about the gardens and about their home country, Philippines
5
Had an early dinner here. Ordered the Crab Chilli Pasta and Halibut Fillet, and it was simply amazing. We were served by Alice who made us feel welcomed and even checked in on us during our meal. Wonderful place! Would visit again soon!
5
The food as always was delicious and well presented.
The service was excellent, kudos to Asst. Manager Chan, and her Service Crews.
The concierge Mae Ann could pay more attention to the customers need.
5
Wonderful service and meal portion is generous. Very helpful and attentive service personnel. Recommended for any occasions.
5
I highly recommend The Halia, it has good food, great ambience & staff. Organize a birthday celebration not too long ago, staff texted me menu as well as directions to restaurant. Will come again for sure.
4
First time dining at The Halia and it was a pleasant experience. Staff were very helpful and made recommendations on what we should order. Hadnt been for the humid weather, we would love to be outdoor and enjoy the music from the performing band. Will come back to try their brunch!
5
The ambience is top notch. I was served by Alice and she was very genuine and she paid special attention to our requests of writing Happy Birthday on the dessert plate. She went the extra mile to make sure we are comfortable and she made sure she was available when we need her. Thank you for the extraordinary experience today, Alice and the Halia team
5
Loves the restaurant setting in the Tropical Garden surrounded by greenery especially with the ginger garden next to it. FYI, Halia means ginger in Malay. The drinks & food here are pretty unique, with plants, spices & especially ginger use as ingredients. Plenty of choices for vegetarian. For the drinks, we tried Goji Berries Infusion, Cucumber & Basil, Lychee & Thyme. There are all fantastic, refreshing, not only taste greats, but looks good too!For the main, I had the vegetarian Puff pastry parcel with butternut Squash, spinach, feta cheese, basil as filling in the puff pastry - absolutely delicious! My friends opted for Singaporean Chili Crab Spaghetti, and they were both impressed by it too. The fact that they get to enjoy the crab without getting their hands dirty helped too.Lastly, the desserts, we tried the die die must have chocolate, ginger spice all things nice & sticky toffee pudding, and there were all so good that I had a time picking my favourite. Will definitely come back for more, and great place to bring visitors in town. This place is always busy on weekend. Even weekday night is better to reserve if you have >4 pax.
3
Great drinks - well-presented and good selection. But the snacks we ordered were very average, at best. Staff were efficient, but somehow lacked the tourist touch
5
1) Food was good! Portion, taste and price are matching and worth the travel there2) Staff were friendly, helpful and would extremely go further for you. Would like to mention the susupervisor, Dennis Rovie, who helped and enhanced my experience there. I was celebrating my friend's birthday and he did the sweetest thing to help surprise him. Also to the other staffs, although I don't know your name, you were extremely helpful!!!3) Ambience was amazing. Being in Botanic Gardens simply gives you a serene feel while dining there as well
5
The highlight of this meal was the specialty drink menu which consists of juices infused with herbs. I had the lychee juice with thyme. You get to add the infusion yourself based on your preference. The food was good. The chilly crab dip was amazing! Recommend visiting for sure! Service was great. They were able to accommodate party of 5, mum in wheelchair. They have a ramp for wheelchairs to the right of the entrance. Grab a light jacket though, the AC is set a tad too low and it's quite a change from 28F outdoors to 18F inside the restaurant! Of course, you can sit in open air veranda or covered porch as well.
5
The staff that catered to us were so warm, welcoming and also very attentive to our requests. Thank you so much for really making this experience a lovely one :)
4
Meal was good.Maybe too filling for me.I really liked the soup (pumpkin soup).The outside seating area was nice.Our waitress Alice was also helpful and friendly.
5
What a perfect place for a late breakfast in the gardens. Alice was so nice to us, and the morning chef so helpful with dietary issues. Just wonderful.
4
Nice little restaurant in the national botanic gardens in Singapore .You can get here easily by catching the hop on hop off bus which goes all over the place in Singapore.
Nice lunch here .
5
The dishes were great and the staff cared enough to entertain us, especially Raja and Ratnah, who engaged us well. Thanks to all the staff!
4
Service is very good. Waiter recommended the right foods, drink n deserts. Price is reasonable.üòãüòãüòã
4
We had a lovely lunch and quite moderately priced for Singapore. Our waiter, Alice was great, the specialist drinks delicious and the food delicious.
4
Visited twice within a week for Sunday brunch and Friday dinner. Reservation is recommended though we managed to get an outdoor table without reservation on both occasions. Interesting menu. Love the dessert - pudding (can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t recall the full name). May visit again to try different items on the menu.
3
It was the first time for me but my friends been there a week before and enjoyed the food. However the second time around the food was not as good especially the lamb was too much fats. Also the beef short ribs was mostly fats. Overall food was not consistent and its not cheap e
4
Brought my boyfriend for his birthday dinner. Great ambience and food is good. The service is awesome. I've written additional notes for 'Happy birthday' to be written on the plate of our dessert. They managed to accomodate. It's fine dining, so the price is ouch. But once awhile, why not
4
After exhausting ourselves walking around the Botanical Gardens it was a relief to sit down and get a cool drink to start with. We then had something to eat and enjoyed it. Didnt enjoy the walk back though because it was sweltering
5
Very good ambience and atmosphere. I would recommend, it is great value for limited healthy options in the menu.
5
The staff were really friendly, service was good and so was the food.
The setting was really immaculate, not to mention scenic.
5
Was looking for a nice halal place to bring my date to. Found this place and it was amazing. The staffs were very friendly and made the night even better being very professional. The scenery is awesome. We got there earlier to take a few pics before heading for our dinner.If you guys go there lookout for Raja and Edwin. These guys were simply awesome. They explained each dish before we ordered them and even explained the dish after they arrived. They made sure we were having a good night and thanks to them we definately did. Cheers to the
5
The lamb rack was really good! Pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff. The waitress attending to us (wish I could recall her name) was so nice and made sure we were comfortable. Had the 'Die die must have chocolate' cake for dessert √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú super rich and yummy
5
I celebrated my wife's birthday and was looking for a halal restaurant with good food and nice ambiance. This restaurant exceeds my expectation. The food was excellent, so was the service by Dennis and Maru, who accommodated to all our requests. I had wagyu beef steak which was probably the best steak I've ever had. There's also a prayer room which they personally escorted us to the room. Highly recommended
5
I went to the place for late lunch. I enjoyed the food . it was freshly made with good taste and presented well. The staff were courteous and very helpful. I brought my wife and 1 year old daughter along with me. They helped me with the baby chair, cutlery for the baby and a special,Thanks to Ms. Alice for engaging with the toddler and keeping her entertained.
4
Starters & mains: 3 star ***On par with the average French bistro in Paris. Not spectacular, but good. Dessert & Drinks: 5 star *****The fig tart was delicious! Yum yum yum. Their home made drinks are awesome!! Service: 4 star ****Friendly staff, which also sang a birthday song. Ambiance: 5 star *****Outside seating in the botanical gardens just rocks!
5
We visited the Botanic Gardens d and as it started to rain decided to visit Halia until it stopped. We were welcomed by Dennis,Ramli and Rovie who provided us with wonderful service. We only ordered a tea and a soft drink but their attention to us was the same as if we had ordered meals. When we mentioned that we were just waiting for the rain to ease as we had not bought raincoats or an umbrella they went away and came back with two plastic ponchos for us. When we left my husband who has walking difficulties was helped to the entrance. We were thrilled with the service and attention
4
It was a stormy night but we still went ahead with our reservations at Halia with no regrets. Food was comfortingly delicious. The service went beyond the call of duty as one of the staff went all the way to another spot in the Botanic Gardens to help pick my friend who was stranded in the heavy rain. We felt at home after that as Dennis our waiter for the night took very good care of us & we even chatted like we knew each other for so long. I would definitely recommend Halia anytime to anyone visiting Singapore or anyone looking to feel comfortable outside their homes on any given day
5
Impressed with prompt service and friendliness from staffs. Food was great, ambience was nice! Would like to specifically say thank you to Raja, Arnel & Dennis for serving us, making sure everything‚Äôs good and also the birthday surprise üëçüèª

One of the tastiest ribs I had. It melts in your mouth. Thanks Dennis Castro for the awesome recommendation and being so welcoming. The herbal concoctions was thoughtfully served in a cup in case you don't want your drink to be too overpowering on the herbs. Highly recommended for special occasions. Do reserve especially on Friday and weekend nights! If you don't drive, take a cab to Tyersall Ave which is nearest to The Halia

Halia is located in the heart of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It has a ginger theme with the spice (and its numerous varieties) featuring in a number of dishes and beverages. The food was excellent with a more western bent than what you would expect. The desserts and drinks were the highlight: beautifully presented and very tasty. The atmosphere and being in a lush garden is definitely worth the taxi fare.

What's good:- the location- good foodWhat's not good:- the service is VERY slow although the staff is freindly- portions are a bit smallIs it worth waiting for

Celebrated our wedding anniversary at The Halia last weekend and was not disappointed. We were seated outside on the patio but it wasnt humid or uncomfortable at all. Lovely breeze and the ceiling fans more than makes up for it. had 2 appetizers and 2 mains which were very lovely and filling! The staffs were very polite and attentive. checked up on us to make sure our food was ok and gave good recommendations as well. the lovely waitress, maru also wished us happy anniversary when she brought out our desserts.definitely recommend this place for romantic dates or a relaxing chilled out dinner. will come back again with the kids to try the brunch next time
4
Had the sampler for 4 pax. Comes with Soups and all the way to Desserts. Cauliflower soup a bit tasteless. But the rest of the other meals made up for it. Ambience is good. Service is good. Friendly waiter is what u need for a complete dinner experience. If you drive, enter by Tyrell Avenue. Else it will be along stroll to Halia. Will definitely go back to try their ala carte. Kuddos

1) The food is nice 2) Using different elements on the dish reminds us masterchef3) Ambience was relexinh 4) Was a big suprised for my husband 5) He got a little embarrassed by the birthday song and i was shocked too coz i didnt knew it would happen. 6) Was a great experience would come again Thanks for the excellencies

went for late lunch in early september & i must say that the ambience and service was superb. but the food was kinda disappointing. im fine with the small portion but the food doesn't taste so great or ravishing to speak of. special thanks to Musa & Tao Ha for their impeccable service. :

We visited restaurant Halia as part of our Botanic garden tour. What a positive suprise it was. The mango prawn salad was so beautiful and delicious that it was hard to believe. Also the mussels were good value for the money. The speciality for this place was the selection of juices with innovative mixing with herbs. We tested Lychee with thyme, grape with tarragon, goji berry infusion and cucumber&basil. They were just wonderful, and a perfect match with the botanic environment. I really wish I could visit Halia again.

Service was superb! Excellent! But.. the food was rather disappointing.. Good atmosphere to dine at night though.
5
My Friend I had 'lamb rack ' and 'chicken'.
The chocolate dessert is a die die must try. Rovie and Raja gave us awesome service. Overall it's a great dinner Night.
5
Great food and ambience. Thanks to Alan for making our first visit there a memorable one for my hubby and I.
5
Well positioned ambience... good cooling weather helps a lot! Friendly staffs
The menu has just the right variety of choices.
5
Delicious food, tranquil gorgeous surroundings at lunchtime, a treat and escape from the humidity after visiting the exquisite Orchid Garden.

Great food, awesome place. Friendly staff and accommodate to my husband‚Äôs requests. üëçüèªto Mr Truong

I went to The Halia to celebrate my mother‚Äôs birthday. I was served by Truong, who offered us impeccable service. However, we soon found that service excellence at The Halia went beyond just a single waitstaff and is palpable restaurant-wide. We arranged for some dessert to be served to my mother as a surprise and a female staff member (can‚Äôt recall her name unfortunately) went out of the way to make the surprise happen. She played along very well and I‚Äôm really grateful to her for her dedication. The food is of acceptable taste but does well when it comes to quality. We had steak, ribs, pasta and poultry. Red meat portions can be rather small, even taking the premium cut into account.
5
Our exceptional experience started with a text message from one of the staffs who confirmed our reservation and provided us with the menu and answers to some of our queries.We then had the pleasure of being served by Truong and the rest of the wait staffs.Although the aircon was a bit cold, we were soon warmed up by the warmth of Troung who provided us with prompt and excellent service.Truong took the trouble to explain the pairings of the different courses. He also came over to check if the food was to our liking and was accomodating on a last minute request.All in all my family and I had a memorable night in celebrating my mother's and brother's birthday. Keep up the good work
5
We have 4 of us excluding 2 young kids (age 1 and 3). The kids were given Colour pencils and art paper to keep them entertained. We had a pleasant lunch and the food was great except the drinks. The drinks were too fanciful to our liking. Shout out to Dennis Castro as he is very attentive to our needs. Wagyu beef burger is a must try!
4
Had a party of six for a bridal shower. Ordered the wagyy beef, chilli crab spaghettini and the desserts were awesome!- ginger garden and sticky toffee pudding. Initially, i think it was a busy evening for them, so the service was not up to speed. But it ended perfectly where dennis and another lady from the service crew helped us take multiple photos.We had a nice little corner reserved for us, but would be great if we had maybe the outdoors next time. But overall, still really good as we had such a lovely time! so Thank you to the team at the Halia
5
We decided to celebrate our daughter's 13th birthday at Halia. Good ribs & steak! Nice ambience! Good service too! TQ so much!
5
Very warm and professionnal welcome, especially Dennis.
We really enjoyed this very healthy, fresh original fruit and herbal drinks.
5
Good ambience, great food, helpful and friendly staffs. Special mention to Musa, who has excellent product knowledge!
5
Had "Brunch" at Halia. The food, drinks, setting and service were all magnificent. So many good choices and everyone I was with loved their drinks and meals. Dennis Castro looked after us with efficiency, courtesy and a smile! Thank you Dennis!
5
Great find by the ginger garden in the botanical gardens. We went in for a drink after visiting the Orchid Garden but stayed for lunch as well when the rain started. Lovely salad and interesting selection of infused waters Staff were so friendly and helpful.
5
The food is amazing - Try their Chilli crab spaghettiniService staff are always on their feet and knowledgable. Really prompt in answering queries about the menuTips:1. If you do not like to sweat [even a little], request for a sitting in the air conditioned area of the restaurant. Sitting outside [under a fan] was pretty amazing and refreshing - just note of honey bees flying around. 2. Do reserve in advance as place was a little pack [but just nice] during peak hours - lunch3. If you are driving/taking a cab - Drop and/or park at Tyersall Entrance as it is much much nearer to walk to the restauran
5
We are so delighted to have Musa to serve us with his wonderful cheerfulness n recommendation! Simply love the food we ordered and i had a good time spending my hubby's bday and he also simply love it. Musa was so accommodating to our 2 small kids and to our request. He made it a breeze. The fries was so nice with wagyu beef melts in the mouth..! Also the chilli crab spaghetti is so niceee!!! We totally cleaned up our plates cos its so mouth watering good! Simply didnt regret eating there.. Thank you Musa!!! We will denifitely come again.

15 of us gathered here, staff were really accommodating and helpful with two young babies and prams. Helpful with menu suggestions and what to drink. Delicious tea mocktail and water readily available. Everyone enjoyed their food. So much so one of my guests booked for her birthday a week later.Staff remembered me and asked if I wanted the same drink as previous week, colluded with me to pay my friends lunch bill and nothing seemed too much trouble. Such a wonderful experience. Paper bag fish was highlight second visit as so many ordered it first time. All food delicious satisfied diners all round. Highly recommend. New car park makes it VERY accessible from Tyresall Ave
5
I didn't even mind the price They say don't convert dollars to ringgit when it comes to good food!Situated in the middle of Singapore Botanic Garden (just beside entrance to Orchid Garden), we had a nice warm-up walk to get here. Wonderful ambience (apparently no mosquitoes, thank god). Very friendly and helpful staffs. One particularly is a Phillipine guy (so sorry i forgot the name ) who waited on us. He charmed us with interesting conversations while helping out with the menu choices...Of course we had drinks with spice concoctions - a ginger honey drink (where u grate it yourself), blueberry masala soda (i was the only one who liked this), banana cinnamon. We had the buttersquash puff, baked fish with Japanese rice, chilli crab spaghetti, chicken stew with a side of mashed potatoes. But hands down the desserts were a unique indulgence! Especially the fig mousse. Even the more "common" brownies was delicious Just wished the portions were larger!
5
Went to Halia for my Wife birthday celebration. Outside dining was full but staff was kind enough to arrange a special seat outside! Truly grateful... food was nice, presentation and portion is acceptable. Arranged with staff for a birthday surprise... was amazed that they actually sang a birthday song together! Overall experience is a great unforgettable evening... good job
5
Celebrated my fianc√©e birthday over at The Halia last Saturday, was very impressed by the food and staff there. Definitely will visit The Halia again!
3
Great drinks & nice good but lacks the atmosphere I was expecting. Outside seating looks nice but it was too humid when we visited.
5
Great food, great restaurant and good service. Have been back many times. Always very good and a nice break from the heat of the gardens
5
We went there for our wedding anniversary and they were very adorable, little attention like "happy anniversary " on the dessert plate. Food is healthy and tasty, staff very nice and you have the feeling that you're on holiday, it's so peaceful, hide in the middle of the trees.Highly recommend this restaurant. Btw: they don't serve alcohol, but they have very nice refreshing homemade drinks I'll for sure bring couple of friends and family there;

As is it's won't most days in Singapore are punctuated by a thunderstorm. Such was the case today. I am writing this in the restaurant as it's still pouring down. A previous reviewer said that it lacks atmosphere. Possibly so, but this is more than made up for by the delicious food. My wife and I both had the Lemongrass and spicy prawn salad-delicious! Oh yes and a portion of fries. Equally good. Coffee also good which is not the general case here in Singapore. Well we've finished our coffee and it's still hammering down. Let's hope the pleasant staff take pity on us.

What started off as a dinner among fairly new friends ended up like a joyful family reunion! Does good food, resort ambiance and friendly experience all add up to make a memorable evening? It certainly does!!We arrived to find a table for 10 persons, all nicely made up. The high ceiling within the enclosed area was anything but claustrophobic. Freedom of this garden assured me that we wouldn‚Äôt be bothered by conversational hums from the far end table at the other end of the room. The rustic wood carved table and simple settings were welcoming for starters. As the guests arrived, so did the menu! Choice! Choice! Choice! While every ala carte item looked wonderful in print, it‚Äôs every discerning diner‚Äôs nightmare that the one dish I have ordered always looks sadder and less wonderful than my neighbour‚Äôs!! Their luscious plates always look more unique and is screaming that accusing voice, ‚ÄúYou SHOULD have ordered me instead!‚Äù Our table, wisely settled for the set menu for 6 and another for 4. ‚ÄúCommunal Feasting,‚Äù it reads‚Ä¶ and that way, we get to eat everything served up‚Ä¶ never mind the French portions for every dish‚Ä¶ every one dish was worth a mouthful or more. Our adventure soon began when the cream of cauliflower soup was served to each of us, by pouring the golden liquid from an aluminum kettle!! Shocking!! Soup in a kettle? My common sensibilities took a while to settle that image in! Tuck into the soup with a decent morsel of bread, and everything was just fine. At Halia, you can expect no porcelain plates. True to everything Southeast Asian, the rectangular wooden plates were a much better choice. Even when new sets of wooden plates were later used for dessert, there was no hint of the savory crossing over to the sweet. It is not easy to pin one culinary style of Halia. If fusion is a justified term, Halia has a stronger leaning towards the Asian palate. However, do not expect a robust copy of what you can find at the hawker centre (even though it‚Äôs a gem there in itself). Instead, you deeply imagine a set of bold European culinary hands, cupping ever so gently, the subtle hum and hints of the soul of Asia. Kudos, chef and team!! Everything part of Communal Feasting menu was visually inviting on the plate and well-balanced on the palate. The curried watermelon blended well with the raw yellowfin tuna, while the hint of smoked sweet paprika or chipotle in the piquant mayo turned a simple potato fry into a fiesta in the mouth. The table favourites were the mussels in coconut and ginger flower broth, tender chicken breast, full blood blackmore waygu rump and rib, and chilli crab spaghettini. In fact, those were all the mains!! The halibut, oven-baked in a paperbag, pleased the more traditional tongue among us as Japanese flavours rose up with the sambal bunga kantan (ginger flower). Dessert names were rather pale in comparison to what they actually were. While all desserts were well done, moist and flavourful, the clear favourite was the coconut moose, lightly perfumed with cardamom and ginger. True! We tasted no less that 9 dishes and 3 desserts... nicely filled up and deeply satisfied were we!Throughout the meal, our table was wonderfully taken care of by the warm, chatty and welcoming servers! Well done Edwin, Dennis, and Maru!! Again, bravissimo chef!! Well done Halia. However, while table service was wonderful, I would appreciate a little more care in the bathrooms, that were stained with unsightly droplets on the floor, cigarette smoke filled, marring the senses of eyes and even worse, the nose. Shame to have to add this, despite a wonderful experience at dinner. Despite this shock to the senses there, Halia still ranks high on my list of must-eat places. I appreciate it being unpretentious, unconventional, and unpredictable‚Ä¶. and all in a good way. May you grow Halia, to reach out to more people in our little island of Singapore with the careful mix of bold and yet subtle flavours. May you never lose your hallmark ‚Äì to turn every dinner guest to a family and friend, coming home

I think the part of my dining experience that deserves the most credit will be the service provided. Both the manager and the rest of the service team were amazing. They were all equally attentive and concern for the diners. To be honest, this kind of service shown is rare to find in a bustling city like Singapore. Throughout my dining experience, my family and I felt that we were all well taken care of even though the entire restaurant was full. The food itself was the right portion, leaving you just full enough for dessert. For the price you pay, you can tell the food is worth the money. I liked how the choices of drinks, were not too sweet (since all the options were non alcoholic). It had the right amount of herbs to complement the sweetness, which was refreshing for the warm weather if you are sitting outside. I would definitely dine again to try the brunch or just other items on the menu. I recommend this place for diners looking for halal food at a premium price.

I came here with my husband and one of my girl friend to have our dinner here. Well as this was our first time to this restaurant, we kinda lost our way but we managed to reach after 19 mins of walk to be exact. We were well served by raja and tao ha. Overall a great experience
4
Came with my family for a celebration and left full and contented.Away from bustling city life Halia offers great dining ambience with friendly and warm service that makes you feel welcome.Great recommendation on drinks selection which is a great hit for me.Food was excellent although some like chilli crab pasta could have been better.Steak was great and the salad is a big favourite for my famil
4
Had a great time here with family where we managed to try most of the menu. We had a baby with us and he was entertained by the toy provided by the restaurant. Enjoyed the food thoroughly (esp the fish and steak mains) and our host Ms Tao Ha was a gem. Would love to be back again

Food at Halia is very good, very tasty...we had lunch at the restaurant and we feel the warm hospitality...
Thanks Tao Ha...

The beautiful surroundings were soo delightful. Musa our server was helpful, professional and so entertaining! Food is delicious and fresh if a little pricey. Thank you Halia for a memorable girls day out with my cousins!! Your wagyu burger and Pain Perdu are winners!

This restaurant has a great tranquil surrounding and serves delicious food, albeit at expensive prices

I expected more from this place based on the reviews. Food was okay average, nothing in particular was great. I expected much better service from the crew. One of the staff really made us feel welcomed, the rest could have done much better
5
I'd been wanting to come here ever since I learned that they'd received their Halal certification. An opportunity finally presented itself when last weekend and we decided to head there to celebrate a dear friend's birthday over dinner. The restaurant is not the easiest to get to but the setting more than made up for it. We were a table of 7, seated outdoors with nothing but a view of nature and a jazz band to put you in the mood, if you weren't already. The food was great, the company even more so, but our host Musa was absolutely delightful from start to finish. He was extremely attentive, gave helpful suggestions on what to order, and radiated charm and humour throughout the evening. What a legend. My friends and I couldn't stop talking about him
5
it was beautiful.set in the lush green and the dark evening night, you suddenly see this restaurant and it's almost inviting you in. beautiful night. food's great and the embiance is nice. the staffs are all nice and attentive especially arnel and dennis.their knowledge of the the food and recommendations are on the spot. we had a great time and plus i nailed it with wifey. they came out with a dessert cake for her birthday. she was blushing and ofcourse happy
5
After a long day of walking in the heat and humidity this is a nice oasis. Pleasant staff and service excellence. Good menu and good food. Relaxed atmosphere with a "come as you are" feel. Be careful, no alcohol. Surprised us with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Touching and kind. Service- perfection

If you are looking for a place to have a hearty breakfast in lush greenery, Halia IS THE PLACE! On my 1st and 2nd visit (yes, I came for 2nd time!) I was warmly greeted by a very bubbly lady, Alice. She is very friendly lady with a beautiful smile.I thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast on both occasions. I personally enjoyed the Truffle Scrambled Eggs on Toasted Sourdough. It was delicious! My cousin was still raving about the drinks that they served at Halia.And one exceptional lady that I need to mentioned...a lady that serves us, Ma Tao. Thank you very much! I highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a great start to your morning and it is HALAL
5
I highly recommend the Paperbag Oven-baked Halibut fillet, the gravy goes perfectly with rice and a tiny bit of the sambal. My boyfriend had their Tajima Wagyu skirt in medium well, it was tender and so juicy ! We had their Deepfried Salt & Chilli Squid which go well with their dipping sauce. Food itself is already superb accompanied by good service from Raja who is helpful and quick in responding to our needs. Overall a very heartwarming experience to eat in the garden.

My daughter's fiancee recently planned a family dinner at The Halia as a birthday surprise for my daughter. He had been liasing with Ms Siti who is the concierge of the restaurant with his detailed plans for the surprise. To our delight Ms Siti and her team went way beyond our expectations in terms of their service and the manners they executed the event. There was a surprise birthday cake for the birthday girl and they even lighted a candle on our dessert plate for my son's belated birthday in August upon hearing that we had wanted to come earlier for his birthday if not for the planned surprise for his sister. Special mention to Ms Tao Ha for her 5 star service level whom together with Ms Truong Chan added the elements of surprise to our little event. What can we say.. the ambience was just beautiful, surrounded by the lush greeneries around us and the food was pleasing to our eyes and our pallate. We took the Communal Feast Menu for six and were very pleased with the spread. The whole wonderful dining experience was only made possible with the team behind the Halia. Highly recommended if you want that little special touch to your celebration. 2 thumbs up to The Halia, Ms Siti and her team of staff. We will be back for sure.. Rizal and the Aziz's family
5
Staff were friendly and pleasant experience with good food and unique taste..love the food from starter, lights, mains and desserts!!
5
Wonderful place set in trees, flowers and foliage - non alcoholic cocktail are a thing of beauty - worth a visit

We went for dinner together as a family and bad excellent service by Dennis Castro the whole evening. He was attentive to our needs and ensured we had an enjoyable experience at the restaurant.

Awesome food fresh ingredients, nice friendly service specially Alice and Raj , sure will come again

What better place to have lunch than the Singapore Botanic Gardens. After visiting the Orchid Gardens, my wife and I were tired and hungry. Just beside the Orchid Garden is The Halia, a very pleasant restaurant which serves very good food.We had brunch there once and this time we decided to try their lunch. We were not disappointed.The staff is friendly and helpful. They make you feel welcomed.We were served by Tao Ka. She is friendly, polite and helpful. She and all the staff always greet you with a smile
5
Simply outstanding! Visited on a Sunday evening and was knocked out by this gem. Our waiter Raja was attentive, friendly and took the time to explain the food and drinks, both when ordering and on arrival. Exceptional, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked dishes. The location was beautiful, even at night and it was very reasonable. Ticks all the boxes and then som

Booked my lunch reservation on weekday via Chope. Indicate remarks, celebrating my partner's birthday. Upon arrival, we were served by Alice. She took our orders & noted that it was my partner's birthday and even told me they have special arrangement dessert for us later. But until we finished our food and I asked for the bill at the end of it, I was surprised I have been charged $10 for my dessert which I didn't request in the first place. I assume it was complimentary as a gesture. Staff didn't really explain to me properly, if I knew it is chargeable I would have choosen my own preferred dessert!!! A little bit dissappointed with her service which she could have explain to me better in the first place.Food was good, lovely place for brunch & it's a hidden gem within Botanic Garden. We came here around 2+pm & it was quite crowded. So I would suggest to make reservation 1st before you head here. Wanted to try their slow cooked tender chicken breast but it was sold out so we had their chilli crab spaghettini, deepfried salt & chilli squid (small portion @$15) & panfried barranmundi. Price wise is quite pricy. We spend total of $100+ for the 3 & the paid dessert we had. We will probably return here again only for special occassion but not for casual lunch or dinner
5
Came here for a Birthday Celebration. We were served by Raja & Ha and they were very helpful! It was top notch! Good food and unique flavours especially the desserts! Sticky toffee pudding & DIE DIE chocolate was ze bombz! Definitely will come back here again!!
4
Great restaurant. I highly recommend the Caesar salad, mussels, fish, and chocolate cake. They were delicious. We also got the steak and I recommend skipping it as it was just average. Great little spot in the botanical gardens. I thought the prices were very reasonable (except for the steak).
5
First I knew it was going to be a winner when the concierge gives you a personalised WhatsApp message about the dinner appointment complete with a map and an e-menu.We arrived a little late but they seated us in a lovely spot (the whole restaurant is almost like a bali botanical themed resort and i almost felt like I was off mainland Singapore) We got complimentary drinks since our mains took awhile (it was still okay since the staff were so friendly and attentive)On to the food, we had the soup of the day - a pumpkin with honey soup with bread on the side, mash for sharing, the Slow cooked tender chicken breast and braised minced leg potato gratin that came with ‚ÄúWok-hei‚Äù cabbage, mushroom sauce [the potato gratin was THE BOMB, with a tinge of very mild spice and chicken chunks in it] as well as the Paperbag oven-baked halibut fillet. The fillet came with a Soy & ginger broth, sesame Japanese rice, wakame, wasabi aioli, ginger flower sambal. NOW THIS GINGER FLOWER SAMBAL WAS TO AMAZING, i have been dreaming about it ever since dinner last night. **Ambiance was A+ and so was the food to match the standard.** We came here for a birthday dinner and the staff did a beautiful plating of their die die must try chocolate with birthday wishes, all crowding out to sing a song. They close at 930 but we stayed till 1030/11 where they were so patient with us, telling us to enjoy our time here. I CANNOT THANK THE TEAM ENOUGH(i dont know all your names), ESPECIALLY CASTRO AND MARU but you have made the night so special for us and we are so delighted.For everyone considering to come here, we had a starter, side, two mains and a dessert at 50/pax. For the gold standard service, ambiance and taste, you'd have expected the bill to be more than double (please dont revise prices as i will definitely be coming back here) Thank you again team halia and see you soon

Amidst the lush greenery and beautiful waterfall lies The Halia. With friendly staff like Tao Ha who take the time to explain each dish and go the extra mile with a smile, The Halia is a must even if you're a local.
4
The Ginger, Honey & Lemongrass drink was very special. The chilli crab eggs delicious. Beautiful setting.
4
Love the ambience. We requested for an outdoor seat because we wanted to experience the atmosphere eating within the greenery. Food was great and filling too. There was a live band which completed our whole evening.
5
Great relation with customers, excellent service. Shout out to the crew that night on 23rd August 2017. Musa, Edwin and Mary great great great service. Would highly recommend for families and dates. Keep up the great customer service and food quality.
5
Great experience. The restuarant ambience was 5 star. Location is rather easy to find and service is good and fast.

Inside the beautiful botanical garden of Singapore, right next to the Orchid garden, Halia gives the hungry tourist the well deserved rest and food. Most of the ingredienti are natural, as the ginger that tinges most plates and comes from the Garden. It can be a bit pricy, but at lunch offers a fixed menu for 28/32 dollars that will satisfy your stomach and your wallet, with a soup (tomato and basil) and a choice of three mains
5
Located in the beautiful setting of the Ginger Garden in Singapore Botanical Gardens, the Halia restaurant has superb food, really interesting ginger-themed drinks and very welcoming helpful staff. The warm CGC (cumin ginger cinnamon house brew that you grind additional ginger and add with honey to your own taste) was lovely and the cold Halia mint berry drink was very refreshing. We enjoyed pan-fried barramundi (melt in the mouth fish served with pignolina (rice shaped pasta) in a coconut cream, asparagus and tomato sauce) and paper bag oven baked halibut (delicious in a soy and ginger broth) served with sesame Japanese rice, wasabi aioli and wakame. We were quite full after that as the portions are generous but the dessert menu was too tempting to decline. The ginger and almond nougatine parfait was excellent and the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream was awesome. We were looked after very well by Truong and Alice. They explained the dishes on the menu and advised us which would best suit our taste. We had a lovely time and would return to The Halia if we were in Singapore for longer.
5
Dropped by to celebrate a loved one's birthday last evening and oh my! was I awed by the presentation of food. We ordered the deep-fried squid, prawn salad, wagyu skirt steak, that humungous lamb rack and closed the night with the yuzu gateaux and fig tart. These were amazingly delicious food cautiously prepared with a myriad of tastes waiting to burst in our mouths. And to top this off, the restaurant is nicely situated in Botanic Gardens. Be prepared to take a nice 15 mins stroll to the restaurant should you enter via the main gate. Else, enter via Tyersall Ave and it will just be a 2 mins walk to the restaurant.Special thanks to the friendly, honest and attentive attendant to our table, Mr Edwin! You made the evening extra special for us.Hope to be back there again soon :

What a lovely Monday lunch at Halia Restaurant at The Botanical Gardens yesterday!It was our first visit too! What a pleasant experience from the time we were greeted to the time we left. The kind receptionist took us to the air-comditioned area of the restaurant but my friends & I loved the ambience & decided to sit in the natural setting to enjoy the breeze. No regrets. We were attended to by Edwin who was professional & attentive to our queries and orders. We were very pleased and impressed with Edwin's kind and friendly service. Food was good. We thoroughly enjoyed the puff parcel, Lamb rib & Rump along with The Butternut Squash Soup and the spinach & mushroom sides. We had two desserts - Ginger & Almond Nougatine Parfait with Coconut mouse, cubed pineapples, dehydrated coconut flesh and a Sticky Toffee Pudding. They were both delicious!!!My friends & I will certainly come again to enjoy the other dishes available on the menu & hope Edwin will be around to enhance the restaurant experience
5
Absolutely love the food there, especially the 500g in-bone wagyu. We ordered quite a few dishes and we were happy with every single dish: the presentation and the taste is so good! The service was fantastic, with Waiters and Waitresses constantly checking up on us, and ensuring our satisfaction. Not to mention, the ambience is so apt with the location
5
Service was excellent, our shoutout to Alice, Maru and Raja for entertaining us this afternoon. Tried out the 3-course set and it was satisfying. My favourite was the die die must have chocolate üç´üòç
5
Great food and ambiance, explemplary service staff (Rovie & Raja especially Musa) who knew the menu intimately and made great recommendation. Definitely would be back again.
4
Good food. A bit pricey and small but the food taste good! The manager was kind and is helpful to any tourist around. He also got a cab for us.
5
Everything was simply good, from the food to the service to the ambience. A pretty romantic place to have dinner within the botanic gardens :)
3
Went there to catchup with a colleague from another country, nice walk from the carpark to the restaurant before dinner. However, we were seated relatively close to a couple so we felt a little awkward talking too loudly. Perhaps they should have sat them at a more quiet area. The squid for a start was good but price was a little steep for the portion. Ordered the wagyu, the doneness was perfect! Didn't really like the potato side that came with it so pretty much left it intact. Also, the chilli crab spaghetti was pathetic and we didn't touch much of it too.... Perhaps the staff could have asked why there's so much leftovers but... they can definitely do with better service. Left a little disappointed...
5
Went there for anniversary dinner and was greeted and surprised by a live jazz music. The ambience was perfect and romantic for a couple or a family. There's indoor or outdoor - we chose outdoor as the aircon inside was too cold. My daughter enjoyed the kid's meal and activity that the restaurant provided. We were served by Raja, one of the pleasant and friendly staffs there. He recommended and explained to us the menu well. I can't resist but to order "die2x must have chocolate"Overall experience was good and will definitely will come back for more
5
The restaurant is situated in Botanic Gardens. Ambience is nice with live band performance. The selection of food is delicious. The speciality juice (which is ginger based) is well blended. The staff here - Rovie, Musa and Raja - are friendly, attentive and provide great service

Was there to celebrate my son 19th birthday. Excellent ambience, food & service. Imagine having a sumptuous meal in the Botanical Gardens which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, wonderful experience. Waiters were very attentive & accommodating. Food was unique in presentation & delicious. Highly recommended!
4
Nice ambience but food could have been better in terms of spread and the vegetarian options. I liked the presentation and touch for birthday celebration ie singing the birthday song. Further personalising this experience by ensuring cutlery that allows for candles and piping in a personalised message would have given that extra return value for me

My Husband and I came for dinner as an advanced birthday celebration on eve of Raya Haji.. Husband made reservation just in case we could not get a table.. My 2 yr old Son was given a pair of Colour pencils and a colouring sheet to occupy him while me and Husband enjoyed the ambience.. We ordered 1/2 dozen of fresh oysters which were really fresh! Our main course were Blackmore Wagyu Rump and lamb rack with beef stew.. The salad which came with the Wagyu rump was unique and yummy.. the truffled potato gratin was the highlight of the meal.. Both of us enjoyed our meal so much and it's worth every cent we spent there.. would love to come back to try out the other dishes
5
From the time we arrived to the time we leave, I've no complain.
We had an awesome foods and service. The server that served us is so knowledgeable.
Thanks Raja.
5
The server Mr Musa was commendable in his recommendation. The prawn salad was fresh and tasty; the Chilli crab dip was unique; and the spaghetti was delicious. There is a wide range of mocktails and refreshing drinks for a hot sunny day too.
5
Love this Halal Restaurant's ambience! Had a great dinner here. Food and drinks were absolutely delicious and service was Superb! Prices are a bit pricey but totally worth it!! Love the live jazz band too!! Will defintely be back again!
5
The food was lip-smacking delicious. The ambiance was very cosy and Halia's personnel's service perfected our evening. A perfect place for celebrations and dining. Thank you for the lovely experience.
5
Try the wagyu burger, it comes with fries. Taste superb, perfect portion and completed with a refreshing drink the lychee with herbs (forgot the name). We love this restaurant and will visit again.
4
Great experience. Good environment, tasty food & warm service.
It helps that we are surrounded by orchids and garden. It's like dinning in a big garden!
5
Excellent food, love the mocktails with many health benefits! Amazing service especially from Raja :) would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
Awesome food and even more awesome staff. I keep returning to HALIA coz I love the outdoor setting; amongst the lush greenery!
5
I came here with my young daughter and they were very accommodating. Dennis was our waiter and he is the reason this place gets 5 stars for me, he suggested things on the menu for us and answered all my questions, looked after my little ones every need and generally gave us amazing service all around, and I saw him do the same for 2 other tables right next to us, 110% dedicated! The location is lovely, the food was great, the infusions are out of this world and the banana almonds smoothie is just about the best drink I've ever had! We had a lovely time here and hope to come back with papa one day
2
Came here for a drink and snack break...bad choice.The drinks are nothing special and one can get the same drinks elsewhere at a quarter of the price
5
We were served by Auntie Alice, whom is very helpful explaining the menu & also knowledgeable with the specialty drinks.
From Mark & Rachel.
4
Nicely managed, good work done by the host Rovie!
Healthy and nutrious menu! Pleasant mood set by jazz on sundays!
All in all a good visit and highly recommended üòä
5
I was greeted warmly when i arrived earlier to make requests for a special occasion. They were accomadating and provided excellent service.
4
Delicious food, drinks and dessert. Flavours are all on point; made hungry tummies happy. Waiters are very welcoming especially Alice with her jovial aura making us comfortable and recommended us great dishes.
5
Second time I'm here within 2 months. The food was as amazing as it was the first time. Would highly recommend the beef ribs (unless you HATE fatty meat). The sticky toffee pudding is also a must-try! Service was attentive but non-obtrusive. Would come back again
5
We loved the communal menu for 4-6 pax as it was good value for money and the portions very reasonable. Not to mention the fact that the food was yummy too! Located in the Botanic Gardens, the surroundings are also very serene and pretty. Special thanks to Traang & Kristin, our wait staff who were awesome and very attentive
5
The Halia's new larger plate dinner menu is perfect for groups of 4 - 6. The staff is friendly, the food is solid and the desserts are innovative. Out of all the dishes my group sampled, I found the Slow-cooked tender Chicken Breast & Braised Minced Leg Potato Gratin ($29++) to be the most unique. The chicken breast is juicy, while the gratin is comforting. Check it out. You won't regret it
5
Food ‚Äì we had a 2 course set lunch which was comprised of carrot and pumpkin soup and a barramundi fillet on a bed of quinoa salad ‚Äì was excellent in fact I can say of the 8 servings of barramundi I have had in the past 6 months this was a standout ‚Äì well done.If visiting the Botanical Gardens this restaurant is a must visit ‚Äì again pleasant staff make the experience all the better
4
I went for a dinner with my wife and our baby (6 months) to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The waiter who served us, Dennis Castro, was very attentive and kind even, especially when our baby started to feel impatient. We chose "Paperbag oven-baked halibut fillet" and "Cauliflower and shallot bake" and when the food arrived the waiter explained us the best way to eat the fish dish. The food was well-cooked with a lot of different flavours on the same dish but well balanced. For dessert we had "Ginger spice, all things nice" and "Fig tart " and they were superb - taste and presentation.We finished our meal around 9.30 pm and we were not rushed out! They even gave us for desserts
5
Our server's name was Musa Imaru and he was excellent. Both him and his supervisor made our celebratory birthday dinner extra enjoyable. He recommended great dishes/beverages, offered to help take pictures of us considering the special occasion, was helpful in showing us directions to where we wanted to go and what we needed, and was just an overall delightful server. The lamb rack, paperbag halibut and banana almond drink we ordered were excellent. Ambience was great, good scenery and the walk through botanic gardens to the restaurant is pretty as well. Would definitely come again!I do want to suggest though that the restaurant should have a small prayer room for the Muslims though, since the restaurant is fairly inaccessible by public transport and there are no mosques around the area.
5
Excellent atmosphere, friendly service, great menu choices! Both me and my fianc√© enjoyed your delicious food and the evening was everything we hoped it would be.
The food are delicious and their serving portion is big. Their ginger flower chili is my favourite.
5
Pleasantly surprised from beginning to end-sent personal reminder of reservation, allowed us to change time of reservation slightly to singing the birthday lady a song without us asking them too..And the food was awesome..we enjoyed every minute of our dinner..
5
I would like to personally thank Dennis Castro for attending to our every needs. We were greeted with great service by Dennis as soon as we were seated at out table till we walked out. Overall, a wonderful experience. Thank you, Dennis.
5
Served by Tao Ha..the service is good and very knowledgeable about the menu items. Very friendly and patient staff as well. Toilets perhaps can be better. The overall atmosphere is pleasant. üòä
5
My mum and I had a great dinner over the weekends. We had wagyu steak and chili crab spaghetti and were not disappointed. The staff service was excellent and they kept checking if we needed any other assistance. Definitely worth the money and are excited to dine in again at the restaurant
5
We stumbled upon this jewel of a restaurant next to the orchid garden. We didn't know that they have a gluten-free menu. This menu includes versions of their main courses, appetizers, salads and desserts. We ordered two dishes from the gluten-free menu (lemongrass prawns salad and we special-ordered a Caesar salad with grilled prawns. The chef was very accommodating. In addition we ordered three main courses from their a-la-carte menu (chicken, barramunda and turmeric chicken). Everything was fantastic! This type of food belongs in a Michelin-starred restaurant. The flavors are natural, well blended and combine perfectly. I also recommend the home-grown ginger and fruit drinks. Kudos to the chef.
4
Lots of birthday Parties, including us! Lovely food, in particular the salt & Chilli squid, paper bag halibut, Lamb rack, Blackmore Wagyu Spare Rib. All with awesomely delicate taste, good quality ingredients. The desserts -Fig tart and sticky toffee pudding were a let down after such a great meal- awfully sweet!We'll be back..
5
Brought some guests to The Halia on the 18 Aug evening. Earlier was booked in another restaurant but decided to cancel it and book The Halia instead. It turned out to be a great decision as the experience was of high standard. The starters and the 'special' drinks were very unique and good. Great recommendations and excellent service by Rallan. The mains were well enjoyed by our party of five. We had the beef rib, Chilli crab and halibut (three person went for this ...) verdicts were good jobs !! We finished with desserts namely sticky, Yuzu and the garden dessert. An enjoyable dinner and experience. Great environment. Jeffre
5
My mum and I went to The Halia for lunch. We had difficulty choosing what to order as the combination of ingredients for the dishes are interesting and it was hard for me to imagine what the taste would be like and if I would like it. My mum on the other hand, cannot understand English and it was hard for me to explain when I myself do not know how to translate some of the ingredients to Malay. Hence, Alice, one of the staffs, patiently explained to my mum in Malay, describing what the taste would be like. We were so glad that we ordered Alice's recommendations cos they tasted yummilicious, especially the sticky toffee pudding. Actually, I have been to The Halia before and ordered other dishes and they tasted fabulous as well. Haven't been disappointed by the food here
5
I had my first year anniversary dinner with my wife at The Halia, and it didn't disappoint. Ambience was perfect, food was delicious, and staff was warm and friendly. Booking through Chope also has it's perks - I used the discounted Chope vouchers to offset the total bill. We ordered Irish oysters, Tajima Wagyu skirt, Halia's Singapore-style chili crab spaghettini, and sticky toffee pudding. The Halia Concierge has a Whatsapp service to confirm my reservation. On top of that, they sent me a picture of their location and menu. What more can you ask for
5
The restaurant was very. Alice wo served us with delicious drinks was also very kind, friendly and funny. we really enjoyed our dishes there.
5
The service was very personal. Environment was lovely. Food was great and reasonably priced. I will be back.
5
Had a birthday dinner for my Boyfriend and it was simply great. The service from Ms Tao Ha and the food was really delicious! Had a 3 course and can't wait to be back!!
5
A great place to have birthday celebration comes with great food, follow up by excellent service! Will definitely return again in time to come!
4
A MUST DO on a Sunday to enjoy the brunch. Nothing fancy on the menu - quite classic brunch menu but very good and the environment is amazing :) Special highlights for the almond banana cocktail, the smashed avocado and the awesome French breach with hazelnut dressing ! Highly recommended !
3
Double date on a public Holiday. Botanic Garden was packed with lots of people. We went early at 10am for brunch. We sat outside, the place has nice ambience and it kind of relax. We order fries as starter, 2 Halia Big Breakfast and 1 Beef Burger to share. We felt the Big Breakfast is kind of normal. I'm not a beef fan but the beef burger surprisingly was nice. Read about other reviews the service is kind of slow, indeed as you need to keep remind the waiter/waitress. Overall we felt the foods is a kind of pricey for the portion and taste. Maybe should have go for the dinner. As I saw lots of better review.
4
Went to check out this place after knowing that it got its Halal certification recently.. great dining experience.. pricey but understandable from the quality and type of food served and location. Nice place for special occasions. I guess weekends will be crowded considering they don't take early reservations and the fact that we saw a large number of baby chairs in the corner :p
4
It was our first time at the restaurant with the whole family of 12. The service was great, even from confirmation of our reservation. They sent us the menu via WatsApp prior to our arrival and response was prompt. Food and service was good. We brought a birthday cake for the birthday girl and they brought out the cake while singing happy birthday song. Paper plates & plastic forks provided for the cake, so no problems or hassles. Just one small drawback was that our table was not ready when we arrived. So perhaps the restaurant may look into reservations and table management since they get a good crowd.
5
Great ambience surrounded by lush of greens located at the Botanic Gardens. Good and honest service by staff Musa and Kristine. It will be good to have prayers room for Muslims since this restaurant has turned halal. Overall a good place to hang out and dine in
5
I went for brunch during our anniversary and their selections were amazing. The ambience was great - we sat outside. The waitresses, Tao Ha & Kristin explained to us the dishes and recommended the type of drinks and made us try out what we normally wouldn't. We were pleasantly surprised by their almond banana smoothie as well as their desserts. Will definitely come back to enjoy a more intimate dining experience.
5
We had a wonderful lunch on 10 Aug to celebrate my wife's birthday. The service provided by the staff esp. Mr Musa was excellent. Wonder how the atmosphere will be like during dinner....
5
Food is really really good. The meats (chicken, fish, beef) are all absolutely yummy, well done with distinct flavours. The chili crab pasta is so rich and delectable. The starters and desserts are unforgettable. SHIOK!! The service staff are friendly and very helpful and attentive.
4
This is my first experience dining at Singapore Botanic Gardens with my boyfriend. We were well greeted when we stepped in the restaurant and I was thrilled how the food that we ordered were nostalgic. We recommend the mashed potato that is very creamy and The Halia Chilli Crab Spagettini for the rich and astonishing flavour.
5
It was my 1st time there to celebrate a special occasion. Reservation was fuss free. Servers (Mae/Arniel) were attentive and great when we ask for their recommendations. They even greeted birthday greetings to my partner upon knowing the special occasion. Food is honestly good. We r already planning to go back.
2
On the spur of the moment we popped into The Halia for brunch. Nice welcome and a very pleasant outside eating area. Very nice. The portions are too small for the price level. Tasty but not enough food. No ice water provided. Service OK but not outstanding. Poached eggs were a bit too runny but not bad overall. For 60SGD for 2 with soft trips then way too expensive.
2
I ordered The Halia Breakfast but was sorely disappointed, although the beautiful setting made up for it. When the dish was served, the food looked like it has been left under a food-warmer for a while. The button mushrooms looked dry, as did the chicken & olive sausage (which came as a slice, like dried terrine). And my scrambled eggs were hard, a bit like SIA's economy-class breakfast: I could easily spear up the pieces with a fork. The sourdough bread, roasted half tomato were acceptable and the kipfler potato tasted dry, perhaps because it was meant to be, being twice-cooked. The Cardamon milk tea was a a bit weak, the fragrance was more evident towards the 2nd cup; by then the tea was already cold even though I was not seated in the air-con area. Perhaps I should have tried the other dishes recommended by previous patrons.
4
My family came here to celebrate my mothers birthday. We ordered the communal menu for 6. Menu consisted of multiple sharing platters ; Wagyu beef, barramundi & halibut. Overall, we were quite happy with the food. Each dish was different and held a delicious taste. Portions were large enough for us to share. My personal Favourite were the steaks and chocolate dessert with the hint of raspberry. Service was great too! Definitely coming back for more soon !
5
They were so on point the moment we step in the restaurant. We enjoyed the experience there fully and the service given was pretty impressive! The ambiance did enhance the overall experience a lot as we felt connected both with nature and the delicious food you guys had to offer. Thank you for the wonderful dinner. We will definitely see you guys again soon.
5
The halia welcomed us in a supreme rainy day, first of al it's really hygienic and clean. Furthermore it's really quality cafe and restaurant, the service is quick and waiters are quite polite, as a cooling drink; the halia mint berry is highly advisable, and banana almond for the kids, have fun in this lovely exotic plac
5
We had a set for 6 pax set menu meal which we shared to our hearts' content. With an Asian-Western menu, every plate was delectable and service staffs making us at ease & comfortable. We especially liked the charred Ceasar salad, Tomato soup, Chilli crab spaghetti & for dessert, the ginger parfait & coconut mousse was the perfect ending to our meal. The name of the dessert said it best - Ginger spice, all things nice. Must visit again
5
Very delicious food and excellent service. Never regret worth the money. Must try.
Ambient is excellent.
5
Love the ambience and food here. Mr Musa was very friendly and helpful. It would be nice if there's menu for kids and a prayer room nearby too!Keep up the wonderful food and service!
5
Amazing experience! Absolutely in love with the taste and the quality of the dishes served.
Also, service by Halia Team was wonderful too. Great hospitality and well deserved compliment for this!
5
Exemplary service staff exhibited by Musa and Edwin who had attended to us. Good if they can incorporate a prayer area for Muslims within the premises.
5
The food was really good and it's halal-certified! Thank you Raja and HA for the excellent service. Highly recommended.

1. Service/AmbianceService standards are commendable. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Appreciate the effort made to summarise the content of dishes served. Ambiance was comfortable and classy. Beautiful surrounding.2. FoodWe didn't really enjoy the dishes except for the following:-a. Boston Bay musselb. Sanchoku rump capc. Chilli crab spaghettid. Sticky toffee pudding and die die must have chocolateThe raw yellowfin tuna was not enticing at all. Did not taste very good either. The Caesar salad looked as though no effort was put in to prepare it. The slow cooked tender chicken breast was definitely not tender but was very dry and bland. The oven-baked halibut fillet had a very bad fishy smell. Prices are a little steep given the serving portion. We would probably not give the communal menu another try
5
Food was excellent. High level of options and taste. Not your regular Halal joint! Very generous mocktail menu to. Very pleased with the level of service by Kristin. Ambience is like none other. Me and my guests feel very comfortable and at ease surrounded by nature and greens! Top class
5
We had a great time at the halia last night - delicious food, good ambience, attentive staff.It was thoughtful of them to send the map and menu prior to our visit - found the place quite easily.Would love to dine at the halia again
5
The dining experience at Halia can be summarised by one word - comfortable. The wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Props to Musa/Raja and Erwin for making dinner tonight very pleasurable. We had a few dishes to share as a family and it was impressive both in terms of taste and presentation. The food was really awesome. Lamb was good (it made me sing the song Mary Had A Little Lamb while i was chewing through the meat, Halibut was as fresh as an ocean breeze, squid left a mark on me, mussels were muscular.The desserts we ordered, a fig tart and the die die chocolate cake was not enough. Bcuz it was too good, we would have ordered another serving had we not already been full from the main course. I like how the staff were open to our feedback and how they took time to explain to us how the dishes were made and even coaxed us into ordering desserts which would leave a smile on our faces. 10/10 would come again
5
Visited Halia for the first time to celebrate my grandmother's bday. Food was exceptional! Service was above and beyond. Unfortunately we did not get all their names, from the lady at the front, to Musa who served and made my grandmother's day a very memorable one!Certified Halal! Gr8 ambience. Only wished there was a prayer room available
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday over at Halia Botanic Gardens and we were very pleased with the food and service over there. Ambience was great too!
4
Had a Sunday brunch after brisk walking. Loved the brunch menu and the nice setting smack right in the middle of The Botanial Garden.Attended by a friendly and helpful waiter, Ramli, who went out of his way to explain the menu and offer recommendations. Good food + helpful staff; can't go wrong!Reason for the rating 4 of 5 stars:I take it concept of the restaurant is to cater both local and tourists alike and since it's halal registered, go one step further and provide a ablution/quiet/prayer room
5
Service was perfect by our waiter and waitress, very friendly and attentive but not too overbearing. (Raja and Maru)Location wise it's abit hard to find and is near the newly opened side of Botanics gardens. Food was good, however, preferred the Halibut at Raffles Hotel branch over the Halibut at the botanics brsnch. Each to their own
5
Tao-Ha was very warm and provided good recommendations. The kitchen suspended some dishes from the menu because the oven/fryer broke down. We were served with complimentary ginger drinks for the longer wait. The slow cooked tender chicken breast was the most tender and well prepared chicken breast I have ever had. Would definitely return to try the other items on the menu
5
I ordered some kind of odd cauliflower bake thing. I loved because I like that kind of thing. We were seated outside and enjoyed having nature so close to us. The food was well presented and the staff was friendly. Our waitress, Alice, was good to us. She seemed to have a little trouble getting the order into her smartphone so I hope that her management can improve that app with time. Overall a good experience
5
after took a long walking inside botanic garden, having lunch at Halia is the best decision we had. the place is very cozy and the food is very delicious. we were served by a very friendly staff name Tao Ha, she's very nice and helpful, she immediately gave us cold water after seeing our very exhausted face (it was 32 degree). surely will be back there again
5
It was a surprise lunch venue by my husband for my birthday.This restaurant was recently Halal certified and he'd thought it'll be a great place for us to try.It wasn't easy to find the restaurant and we got lost.BUT.... it was all worth it.The food was awesome !! The staff were friendly especially Musa who was detailed and explained the food items which we asked about patiently.Both of us enjoyed the Singapore Style Chilli Crab spaghetti, Paperbag Hallibut Fillet and Lemon Grass & Ginger Prawn salad.Thank you Musa for your great service.We would definitely come back with our family. However, it would be nice and thoughtful to have a comfortable and designated area for muslims to perform their prayers while having our lunch or dinner there.NParks - please take note
5
We stopped here to have lunch after touring some of the gardens. We came a bit too early, but we put our name down for a reservation and came back when they opened. We ended up sitting near the back of the restaurant, so not as much ambiance as we had hoped (the bathrooms were outside around the corner), but the service and food were "very nice". I had the heirloom tomato salad with red, green and yellow tomatoes, a hummus red sauce (very light), microgreens, and hazelnuts. The husband had the Ginger Prawn Salad which came with 5-6 prawns
5
Let me commend the amazing staffs who run this resto Ms Ha. She does explain amazingly the menus and that count for me as superb experience. Ended up ordering smashed avocado on tosted sourdough and a cucumber with basil drink. Find the food very satisfying, in fact have chatted with her on how i can prepare them on my own haha. The price for me is quite fair for singapore rate. Let me say this again as how amazing they are from Alice in the front who walks me in and May in the counter. They rock! So happened i didnt bring with me my credit card but got my NETs card and a little cash, however they don't accept the nets payment I have in handy. But these guyz would even allow me if I could just transfer the payment to their personal account and they'll just help me settle to close the bill. Waaah! As helpful and considerate as they were, I told them I would rather just find the nearest ATM which is outside the park than have them worry. With all the trust they let me and was back swiftly in 20mins. Thank you guyz...will truly be back for that buy 1 take 1 breakfast offer.
5
Greeted by a warm welcome at the reception. Our waiter Musa gave an excellent preview of the menu. We were impressed by his product knowledge and attention to details. The food and drinks were well presented. We love the marriage of ingredients that gives depth to the flavours yet complementing one another. A true gastronomic experience that is simply magnifique. C'est la vie
5
Great service, great food, great ambience! Highly recommended dishes are:
1) Deepfried Salt & Chili Squid
2) Lemongrass & Ginger Prawn Salad
3) Halia's Singapore-style Chili Crab Spaghettini
4) Tajima Wagyu Skirt (Medium Well)
5) Die Die Must Have Chocolate
5
Great place to hide away from bustling Singapore city life.
You don't actually feel you're in Singapore.
Service was excellent. Food is quite good. Time taken for food to be delivered is actually quite fast, considering one of the orders was a steak.
5
Had a good dinner at Halia, honest tasty dishes, good portion size and fair price. Our host Raja made us feel really welcome and he was very knowledgeable.
4
We held a birthday celebration cum teachers' bonding meal here and it was a wonderful experience for all of us. The food was great, the service was excellent and we loved the ambience.
Definitely a must-visit!
5
Hello,It was beautiful. Chanced upon an article about you guys over at HalalFoodHunt's Facebook page. Honestly, we came without any expectations, but we left very satisfied with our experience. We were treated very graciously. The staff were all very friendly and pleasant. Rovie stood out the most as she was mainly the one who served us, very knowledgeable about the items on the menu. There was another staff that was exceptional in his service too but I did not catch his name, he was a tall Indian man, who helped us with our later requests. (His name is Raja as informed by Siti from The Concierge) Food came in good time, and they all taste great and served piping hot. Ambience was very beautiful and we were treated to a very melodious live band. A nearby prayer room for Muslims is a plus point for me!One thing that is (very) slightly displeasing is the lack of signs to the restaurant, but I guess that is more for the management of the Botanic Gardens to look into. It took a while for us to locate the restaurant, and after our dinner, we assisted a couple who were wandering around looking for the restaurant too. The only sign posts that points to your restaurant was the one nearest to the place, just after the drop-off point. I give credit to you guys for the whatsapp message we received which confirms our reservation and provide the directions to your place.Over all a 5 star affair and will definitely return to dine.Thank you once again for the experience
5
It's my second visit in a week. Gosh! The food are so good! Could not thank enough the great hospitality , warm and cheerful Chan Myae Thet ..friendly Raja..and not to forget the sweet concierge Siti Ratnah whom put an effort to get me in though all tables are almost taken. My dates enjoy every single dish served at The Halia especially the " die die must have chocolate " yummmy! We Definitely will come back again very soon. Good job Chef! Clap Clap cla

Despite the restaurant not being crowded or being particularly busy, our food took 30+ minutes to arrive. Only the plate was warm, but the food was unappetisingly cold. By this time, the family sitting beside us who reached 10 minutes later than us were already finishing their meals. The waiters and waitresses weren't pleasant either. Upon asking if the sausage in my brunch platter could be removed or replaced with something else, the waitress interrupted my question to say that they could not switch it out.Regardless, the sausage was dry and looked like meatloaf. The scrambled eggs were completely unseasoned, not even with salt and pepper or anything really. Nobody can truly go wrong with sauteed mushrooms, but to be fair, you could get a more generous, better tasting and cheaper portion elsewhere at Cedele or TCC. The potatoes were so dry and had a chalk-like texture to it. All in all, if anyone had to pay this much for a simple brunch platter, they should at least enjoy it.
4
Had a birthday dinner celebration here and Rovie & Truong were really attentive to our wants and kept us comfortable despite the Saturday evening crowd. We really enjoyed our meal which was served promptly. Though the portion is rather small,we daresay the taste was great! Ambience was lovely, with the area surrounded by greens.Will definitely do a repeat visit
5
Alhamdulillah we were excited when it is finally halal. Nice ambience and definitely unique and delicious food served. The ginger flower sorbet was the highlight of our dinner. InshaaAllah will definitely come back for more! P/S: it will be better if there is a small space provided for prayers especially during evening dining as there is no nearby musollah/mosque.Thanks guys! :
5
When I first stepped into the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the exquisite interior design. While waiting for the food to be served, I couldn't stop looking around the place from where I was sitting. I was sitted indoors and the air-con temperature is perfect; not too cold nor too warm. The combination of nature and class was welcomed.The moment I stepped into the greeter at the counter, Ha warmly welcomed my friend and I.I was seated promptly and offered a drinks menu. Appetizers were served quickly. Food were above my expectations and would definitely visit again.My highlight of the trip was the surprise arranged by my friend. Dessert and a birthday song, along with a candle was served.I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Chan, Maru and Allan for their warm hospitality
4
A near-perfect place for any dining occassion.
However, the portions served seem smaller compare to other dining establishments.
5
The atmosphere at The Halia is simply wonderful. Located in the middle of the Botanic Gardens, it feels good to be surrounded by nature! The cuisine is delicious and the service impeccable. During my last visit, our waiter Tao Ha, was over the top!
5
Nice atmosphere, air conditioned, clean and tidy.
Receptionist was very welcoming.
Excellent food and drinks.
Musa was very charming, talked us thru the menu options and was very helpful and attentive.
The service was great.
5
Excellent ambience. Pleasantly served by Dennis Castro. Place was clean, airy and unique selection of food that i think the only kind among the halal restaurants. Will repeat the visit soon.
4
Food was delicious and flavourful with a nice blend of herbs. Service was attentive, especially by Raja
5
Thank you Alice for everything. We had a wonderful celebration dinner! The recommended drinks and food were great too. I love my cinnamon drink and chilli crab spaghetti.
5
Their service made this place excellent leaving me and my partner with a great experience. All staffs were attentive, willing to go the extra mile to check on your feedback, describe their menu and dishes (how it's prepared, how to enjoy it) particularly Musa, plus he's multi-lingual, amicable and entertaining. Not too sure why he's "only" a part-timer though.Food were nicely prepared and presentable with fine quality but it's the ambience and service that gives them an edge
5
Your waiter, Musa, took it all in stride and never treated our first dining experience with anything less than the utmost professionalism. It is service like this that will keep us coming back to The Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens.I simply must thank you for the superior service. Kudos.
5
Gosh, this restaurant was such a lovely surprise! My husband, myself and our two teenage sons had visited the nearby National Orchid Gardens (stunning) and decided to have dinner at The Halia Restaurant as they were recommended in my Lonely Planet book. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, all surrounded by lush tropical vegetation. Indoors was fully booked so we were seated undercover on the outdoor dining deck. And I'm so glad we were sat there because it was beautiful - a balmy evening temperature and surrounded by lush foliage, it felt like we were dining at a tropical island resort! The table settings were lovely. The staff were super friendly and helpful, especially our waitress Tao Ha (hailing from Vietnam), she was delightful. And the food was divine. I had the Heirloom Tomato Salad and it really was delicious. My husband and sons all had seafood and loved their meals. Interestingly, Halia is halal and does not serve alcohol. My husband loves beer so I was surprised that he agreed to dine at Halia and I'm so glad he did. They have the most amazing menu of delicious non-alcoholic drinks and we tried quite a few between the 4 of us. And the desserts are divine! I had the 'Ginger Garden' dessert that must surely be the prettiest dessert ever and so delicious. My husband and son loved their Sticky Date Puddings (generous serving) and my other son loved his unique Yuzu Gateaux dessert. Considering the quality, quantity and presentation of meals and drinks at Halia, I thought they were very reasonably priced. It cost our family $200 for 6 drinks (mocktails), 2 entrees, 4 mains and 4 desserts. The Halia would be perfect for a romantic night out or a special occasion and I wish I could transport it to Melbourne so i could take my friends and family to dine there, it was one of the most enjoyable restaurant meals I've experienced

The Halia ticks all the right boxes and more. From the exquisite, beyond delicious food to the attentive, prompt and efficient wait staff to the friendly and obliging concierge, The Halia really is a must visit. They are so, so good with regard to food and service that I went there 3 times in 3 weeks, with family and friends. Special mention goes out to Kristin and the rest of the staff for making it a truly memorable experience...
4
Staffs serving us were really welcoming. Wish the food options were more. Other thn that, it was a good evening spent over at the restaurant.

It's amazing sitting outside and enjoy the botanical garden.
The salad was delicious and their drinks are really good.
5
I decided to give The Halia a visit for my anniversary with my partner. Boy, did I not regret it!
We were given a table with good setting, served fantastic food and even got a special something to mark our anniversary.
Appreciate it all Halia!

On Father's day / Fasting Month on 19th June 2017, I brought my family to dine at Halia. We chose the communal feast for 6pax. Honestly, we find it much much worth it. With the food quality, food portion just nice for 6pax didn't waste much food. The most I love is the mushroom soup, their homemade bread and their chocolate molten dessert. The staff Rovje whom handle our table she is very friendly and helpful. When I told her I wanted to buy their homemade bread, surprisingly she said it's on the house so I get to bring back for free which is just awesome. Staff name Siti, she did a great job by taking my reservation promptly, when comes to dessert surprise for my daddy, she did help with the plate deco. Everything was just perfect.2nd time dine in with my boyfriend on July 2017, staff Tao Ha whom handle my table, she is friendly and helpful too, again Siti did a great job on taking my reservation. Would definitely come again and again

brought my boyfriend for a surprise birthday dinner. it was our both first experience. love the ambience so much! feel like we are away from the urban city of singapore. we had paperbag stew fish & wagyu steak as a main dish and mussels in coconut sauce and chilli crab dip were superb!. it was OK. love the ginger taste in our drinks and foods. certainly the halia restaurant showing off their ginger tangy taste in every dishes. after the dinner we had a romantic stroll at botanic gardens. He love it so much and so do i.
5
First, our reservation was taken by a very pleasant concierge. We want to be seated outside to enjoy the beautiful surroundings. She knew exactly where to put us. Next Truong and his colleagues rendered some good recommendation and excellent service. We had wagyu steaks, lamb, meals for the children and the ginger deserts. The food was very good. To cap it all the band was fantastic. They played lovely music perfect for the ambience
5
Visited Halia after a break of a few years. Food remains great! The Manager Dennis Castro was absolutely wonderful, and gave superb recommendations for our family dinner. We were honestly happily stuffed! The only thing missing was the alcohol menu, which we were told was no longer available as it is now a halal-certified restaurant. A nice alcoholic drink at dinner would have been nice .... anyway, kudos to Manager Dennis and his crew!
4
Location of the restaurant is perfect - in the middle of SG Botanic Gardens, making it suitable for special dining events. Food is great and worth the price. They also have very kind staffs (Dennis Castro was very friendly!). Would love to come back for a brunch next time :
5
Went there for a last min dessert. Greeted with a nice ambiance. Nice cosy place. Staff are well organised and friendly .We only had dessert and oh boy we wasn't disappointed. We had the fig tart and ginger coconut pineapple cake.Fig tart was delicious. Plating was fancy. All the ingredients mix very well. Especially the tart base.The ginger coconut pineapple cake also was awesome. Taste was well balance and the ginger taste not overwhelming.Staff, Dennis castro made the night even more awesome. Asking ask how the food was. Telling us about the restaurant and what they have on weekday and so on. Overall i might even try to have a meal there instead of just dessert. The pleasant servise staff and cosy atmosphere blends very well.
5
I took my cousins and their kids who were visiting from Australia, to have breakfast after a morning stroll at the Singapore Botanical Gardens. The food, coffee and homemade breads and muffins were all splendid, just ask the kids who wolfed them down! The meal was especially nice as we were served by a lovely elderly lady who patiently explained everything to the kids and also recommended their homemade Kaya jam... Now I have had lots of different Kaya jams in my lifetime and this one was beyond doubt the best I have had yet! Whilst others may say that there may be cheaper options to have breakfast I think that it was well worth it and look forward to returning soon
5
The location is just perfect, friendly staff and good food! Right in the middle of the beautiful Botanic Garden, after a nice walk that's the right place to rest for a while and enjoy your lunch. I just go back there any time I can!
4
Ambience was great. Service was excellent.
Truong, Chan and Pel were really warm in welcoming us and helping with our orders.
5
Service was prompt,food were delicious and the ambience were warm and tranquil...especially for us who hadnt been out for a quiet dinner for years....Thank you. 3 Cheers to all the working staff.
5
The food was of standard and I love the chilli crab pasta! My friends thought that the taste of ginger was a little overpowering but i thought the taste was just right as I love ginger. Their chicken was nicely done as well!
5
Visited the superb Botanic Gardens in Singapore and needed somewhere to eat. Visited Halia and was very impressed. We were looked after by the lovely Alice, who was very friendly and really attentive. Had the chilly crab spaghettini which was excellent and not expensive and washed it down with a cumin, ginger and cinnamon tea with extra honey. A perfect break before we headed back into the gardens. Would thoroughly recommend it
5
I made a reservation. That morning, I was surprised to received a text on the direction to The Halia & the menu. How thoughtful =)Love the ambience; cosy & romantic. The food is unique.We ordered the Chilli crab spaghettini, Panfried barramundi & Yuzu gateaux. Love it!Thanks Tao Ha, Truong & Ramli for serving us & singing birthday song to my wife
5
I had my dinner at Halia, celebrating my sister birthday with my family. I love the ambience there as it is so relax and great. The food is very good and the service from Tao Have is impeccable and I appreciate the attentiveness from her. I will be back soon
5
We enjoyed a beautiful lunch in the gardens. It was a welcome break from the heat. The staff were friendly and the prawn salad was amazing with its infusion of various spices love it. The various drinks were interesting and amazing to taste. A welcome break whilst visiting the gardens
4
This is our usual haunt after a trip to the Botanic Gardens. The infusion and fruit juices are great thirst quenchers and the kids love the paperbag halibut - they always fight over it and in time we learnt to just order two. Great place and great service - most recently from Tao Ha
4
It was my husband's birthday and we decided to try lunching at Halia. Especially when we heard good reviews about it - with the recent Halal certification. The food was ok, just nice. Nothing over the top but good enough. We were delighted that the Kids' Menu was quite of a variety too as we brought along our 4 year old child. One of the server, Mr Musa was very attentive to our needs and provides good service. And oh, Ratna too. We liaised with her for the reservation and she had been really helpful.
5
The ambience is good. It is the first time we experience communal eating and almost every table is a birthday celebration!
3
Food was great but service by Musa was excellent! Worth giving it a try! Best to go by car and try the barramundi!
5
Nice Halal restaurant in world heritage garden. Excellent service. Good selection of drinks and food.
5
Such a beautiful, relaxed restaurant to dine in. We had our appetiser of the pumpkin soup with absolutely delicious focaccia bread. Our waiter, Musa, was a delight. He whipped out olive oil and lime salt and made our appetiser taste even better. We also had the prawn lemongrass salad, halibut and the Yuzu dessert. All amazing. We will be back!
2
The booking was done on line with ease. welcome service was nice and brought us to be seated outdoor near the band & music was nice.Our orders was taken correctly and heard another customer near our seat saying their food was not nice when ask by the service staff. OMG really true when our food came my panfried barramundi with pinola and spaghetti with chilli crab. The fish was fresh but ingredients not tasty except the vinegar chilli in it. The spaghetti was dry but taste of crabs was there and if the chef put in more effort. The coconut ginger & apple paradise ginger was not too bad. They could do better but will not patronize it again. Also they must check their cleanliness of their utensils as a spoon was not clean and place in the box for used. Was replaced immediately all of it when shown to the hostess
5
I visited the gardens on Saturday afternoon and wanted to take a short break. Found The Halia in the middle of the gardens. There was no queue when I got there around 4pm. I tried the coconut parfait with frozen pineapple for $9, it was a great choice. The server, Dennis Castro, was very friendly and swift in his services
5
Great Halal upmarket casual dining option situated in the lush Botanic Gardens. Great to see the Halia go Halal, which must have been a difficult decision. Great food, service, decor and ambience. We had the lemongrass ginger prawn salad, paperbag oven baked halibut and the chilli crab spaghetti. The salad and the fish were excellent. Chilli crab spaghetti, we thought could be a little spicier and sweeter. Perhaps it is catered for a milder European / American palate. Our waiter Dennis Castro was helpful and courteous. Will certainly be coming back for more and will recommend the Halia to family and friends

After enjoying our morning at National Orchid Garden, we had lunch at Halia. Although we felt warm from our morning walks, we chose to dine at the non-airconditioned terrace. The overhead fans cooled us down while we enjoyed the surrounding greenery. As we had arrived 15 mins before their opening time at 12 noon, we ordered drinks. Our food order was taken and the service staff informed us that the food would be served after 12 noon. Not a problem as the wait cooled us down.For appetizers, we ordered soup-of-the-day, the refreshing Lemongrass & Ginger Prawn Salad (which was one of our favorite item) and potato chips. My parents shared an order of Paperbag Oven-baked Halibut Fillet which came with sesame Japanese rice. My wife and I shared an order of Slow-cooked Tender Chicken Breast with Braised Minced Chicken Leg Potato Gratin. Although the chicken breast was indeed tender, we felt that it was too meaty for our preference.We had planned to order our favorite desserts at Halia. However, our lunch turned out too heavy for us to follow through with desserts.Service was polite, thoughtful and attentive. Augmented with the lush garden atmosphere, we had a good lunch

We found out that this restaurant turning Halal and we love Tajima wagyu skirt steak and sunchoku Ribeye and why not just give it a try! We are really really exited to try this place .When approaching the hostess desk , we were assigned indoor table which is full of groups of families celebrating birthday, then we asked the hostess to move us outside so it will be more intimate for me and my newly wed husband. Through out the night we are not able to talk much without screaming at each other due to the loud noise, and when we left there were still tables that empty and not taken. We have been served by Mr Musa, very knowledgeable and friendly. Great compliment for him and we really appreciate his hospitality and recommendations. Let's go on with the menu, small but a lot of variety for the menu. As far as we've been told that the steak is not grill, it's sous vide instead. Fine. So we proceed to order 2 steak (which is 1- Sunchoku Ribeye is not available) then it's been replace with different Wagyu. Since we are here for steak yeay! Let's go for it! When the food arrived it has great presentation however the Chef recommendation of the Ribeye is the big disappointment of the night! Though, dry, blend and plus the steak knife is not sharp, both us us was struggling to cut the steak. Skirt steak was amazing, juicy and flavourful - by the way we ordered medium doneness for both steak.The sauce for the fries was too salty to our liking .We've ordered 2 mocktail to accompanied our dinner, BEATS- wow taste like heaven and PARADISE- very refreshing and light.Last but not least, dessert is called DIE DIE MUST HAVE CHOCOLATE , great presentation and really die die must have for the night. Love the 'pop' feeling in your mouth in every bite. A little something right. The downfall is the staff will go to our table to sell their product which is not really good I think and it make us guilty not to buy the product from them. Not very fine dining or semi fine dining. Overall experience is okey but to come back I think it's a maybe.
5
After visiting the fabulous Orchid Gardens stop at Halia restaurant for lunch. The caesar salad was unbelievable. It sounds a bit weird, but the lettuce was charred and it was exceptionally delicious. We were served by the unforgettable Alice. She was delightful and made us feel like we were honoured guests. We knew we were in for a treat when Alice started singing Happy Birthday to us, she explained that while it wasn't our birthday, (it was our wedding anniversary) the food was so great it had to be celebrated! The minute we get back to Singapore we will be going back again
5
Pleasantly surprised at how family-friendly the restaurant is given the "high-class" impression that we had of it. Staff was friendly and highly efficient. Food was good too.
5
Have always known Halia for good food but they took it up a few notches. Service was truly commendable with our server, Allan, never missing a beat. Our group of 5 ordered more than we should - most of the items were spot on and we returned the plates clean. We could have done with a bigger portion of ginger sorbet :) Atmosphere in the outdoor sitting area was cosy and relaxing; even in hot Singapore, the area was kept quite cool. Parking was surprisingly easy on a weekend evening. And best of all, they recently got halal-certified which means more people get to enjoy this wonderful restaurant. My only gripe: The food menu needs better design; such a nice venue shouldn't be using WordArt from the 90s
4
I have been to The Halia in the gardens quite a few times over the years. The menu looks different now than it did a year ago, although some of the dishes are still offered (esp the fish in a paper bag and the chilli-crab spaghettini). This time we really enjoyed the chicken dish (the chicken oddly comes two ways, but both are delicious: breast on the plate and pieces of thigh in an awesome potato gratin); the pan-fried barramundi was fine but not fantastic. In this always-enchanting atmosphere, however, we really miss having a cocktail or a glass of wine, and their absence may deter us from visiting in the future. This is especially true because this restaurant is best in in the evening, to sit outside when it cools down a bit, and this is also prime time for an adult beverage. I am perplexed as to why they made this change: no one is obligated to order alcohol, but why not offer it to those who would like to have it (especially since the margins on drinks are always staggering?)
5
First visit for a birthday celebration and won't be the last visit for sure! The wagyu beef selection is one of the best I've had and I urge you meat lovers out there to try them out. Definite worth for the bucks! Place is easy to find and 2 mins stroll from the information counter. A special shout-out to the waitress by the name of Alice, a very helpful waitress indeed, assisting us in any possible way to make the celebration a successful one. Thumbs up for the cool ambience, slow music etc. Another shout out to the kitchen staffs for the superb plating, great tasting food. All was superb! Definitely would recommend to anyone who wish to experience nice halal western fusion cuisine. Cheers!
5
My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the service from the team on duty, namely- Kristin, Tao Ha and Arnel. We were really well taken care of from the moment we came through the door to the end of the meal. The staff at the concierge had seated us politely, when we were ordering, followed by really attentive and friendly service all the way through. Halfway, they would stop to check if everything was alright and followed on to engage in some conversation (which is rare nowadays) After the dinner, we had wanted to view The Villa for an event and the staff took the effort to make sure it was possible as the lights in The Villa were already turned off by then. The quality of the food was also great, chicken breast meat was surprisingly very tender and the drink concoctions were very interesting incorporating elements of ginger. Overall, great effort from the team, compliments to the chef
4
Our waitress Alice was really accommodating, even after discussing with her the limited options my mom could eat (no dairy, no gluten, lactose free etc). She had the prawn salad in the end and a 'first order' hot lemon tea. I had the wagyu rump steak which was good, sauce a bit salty tho. Anyway service was good.
5
Halia is a place I always come to when I visit the Botanical Gardens. Even though it's not easy to locate (honestly I didn't know if I would stumble across it again). It was difficult to decide what to eat as we arrived at 5pm but had dinner at home. So we ordered the Yuzu Chateaux with ice coffee and fresh pineapple juice. The Yuzu Gateaux is a very artfully prepared desert with a mixture of citrus (yuzu) foam, grapefruit slices, coffee cream and chocolate. Comes at a pretty penny of SG $13. Never knew citrus and chocolate goes together but here we do. Also, a big shoutout to our server Mr Dennis Castro. He was very attentive and has great attitude. That's why I always pop by Halia when I'm at the Gardens, food that surprises, great ambience and good service. However, be prepared to fork out the appropriate price for this wonderful experience
5
We had two ginger cocktails, typical for the place, and they were pretty interesting. As for food, we had the burger, which was really great, very juicy and full of flavor and the crab spagettini, a little spicy and gingery. :) Tao Ha was assigned to our table and she was a nice person, recommended us the cocktails and their signature dishes, even gave us some hints about highlights of the city.Highly recommend this place
3
We stopped here for lunch while touring the gardens. I had the olives and french fries. The potatoes were very good, the olives were in a strange sauce, somewhat sweet which distracted from their taste. My wife had the tomato salad which she liked very much
5
Celebrated my husband's birthday at this restaurant and it was our first time there.They told me that only outdoor seats were available, and I was actually thankful they put us outside because the ambience was perfect! It was perfectly lit and the fans provided a cooling feeling and there were no mosquitoes at all! It was quiet and the were other couples around too, so no loud noises and was very romantic.We ordered a couple of sides that were recommended by the staff. For mains, the steak was very very tasty and the Chilli crab spaghetti was of the perfect spicy flavour. They offer a wide range of mocktails and house blended drinks so we were spoilt for choice! The dessert also didn't disappoint us!The staff were attentive and very helpful. Overall, it was a wonderful experience dining at The Halia and we look forward to going there again.
5
Everything was beyond perfect. Thank you so much. The service. The food. Everything was superb. We will for sure dine in there again soon! As he said the steak was the best he ever had. Thank you for making it a blast.
5
Definitely will come back wth family and friends...love the clean eating menu, desserts were awesome as well!! Love it!!!
4
Heavy rain otw to The Hali and staff kept me updated and reminded me to be careful while making my way to the restaurant. Very thoughtful
5
Delicious food, cozy ambience, great live band and awesome hospitality. Dinner in paradise! A mini Bali in Singapore‚ù§
5
The food was excellent and our waitress Tao Ha was fantastic. I recommend the Chilli Crab Spaghetti.
5
A must try mini feasting with the family. Amount of food served is more than enough for 6 average adults.Desserts to end the wonderful feasting. Server (Musa) was informative and gave us timely description of each dish served. Thank you for the tasteful feast!

1. ServiceWe had Mr Musa with us for the entire mealtime. He was superbly wonderful! Such positive and vibrant energy from him, and he was very attentive to littlest detail. He ensured we never ran out of water. Since we came in late at about 7.30, he gave us dates to break our fast as soon as we sat down. He went through the menu with us, shared the specials + answered our questions. He continued to check if we were ok, and if we needed anything throughout the meal. We need more of Mr Musa in SG service industry! :) The Concierge at Halia was FABULOUS! Kept me updated on the latest menu + halal status of the restaurant. Even provided a soft copy of the map. A couple of days after the dinner, a check-in message for feedback was sent to me. The Halia is very receptive to feedback -- much appreciated!2. FoodWe ordered 3 items: deep fried squid, parchment halibut fillet, and chilli crab spaghettini.The deep fried squid was AMAZING. very flavourful + nicely battered. Squid was fresh, and not chewy.The halibut was disappointing. It was just bland - even with the overload of soy sauce. The ginger could not be tasted. The rice was too mushed up, unlike most japanese rice. I didn't finish both the fish + rice.The chilli crab spaghettini was OK. The chilli crab sauce was flavourful + delicious. But, the dish itself was too dry. The dryness was similar to a fried bee hoon, instead of the usual spaghettini dishes. 3. Website + reservationIt was very user-friendly, and good user interface - even from mobile devices.It was very easy to make reservation.I hope this helps The Halia in moving forward with the new halal-branding
5
The restaurant had a super nice atmosphere, very cosy yet elegant feel.The food was great! Best chicken breast I've ever had. It was tender, moist and flavourful. The dessert pudding was rich and delicious.Above all, the service was the stand out. The staff are well trained as well as go above and beyond
5
An amazing location, great service and good food. Thats what you need on a holiday, and halia gives you that experience. Excellent service by Alice, who is quite happy suggesting and serving the guests around. I hope to come back soon.Kudos to Alice and the Halia team
5
Thank you chope for the easiest way to do reservation... The place was super duper romantic... food was great and yummy too... i like the surprise make by one of the friendliest waitress... overall i enjoy the moments... u all shud try @ The Halia Botanical Garde
5
We enjoyed two of their inventive fruity iced drinks. I highly recommend trying these delicious cool beverages to quench your thirst. There is a flavor combination for everyone. Nice view of the gardens and a helpful staff.
5
Nothing really to complain about. Great experience overall with a food that brings East and West together
5
We were supposed to get our table at 8pm but the friendly concierge called and allowed us to be seated by 7pm, just nice for iftar! Service was fast, staffs were very helpful and attentive, food was awesome! Excellent ambience!
5
Alice was a fantastic waitress. Excellent service and food ! Everything we asked for was provided. Thanks a lot.
5
We found Halia as a real oasis while on our exploration walk through the Garden. Stylish design, pleasant atmosphere, food and drinks were delicious! Mr. Musa took so good care of us, thank you!
5
I did visit here for a nice glass of refreshing coffee. I can say that this restaurant is a must visit after a good stroll from the Gardens. The staff were accommodating and they will explain to you the information about the food or drinks you want to order. The location was great and cozy. I stayed here for about an hour as I enjoyed the place. I had a good chat with one of their supervisors (Mr. Dennis Castro). He was a Filipino like me, so it was an entertaining stay as I was visiting solo in the restaurant. I hope they would open a branch in Manila. Overall it was a relaxing stay
5
Had our Iftar at the Halia restaurant at Botanic Gardens this evening. The restaurant was recently certified Halal. It was a delicious meal, we opted for the set communal feast with a number of dishes and desserts to 6 pax. The staff were friendly and explained all the various type of dishes to be served. Special mention for staff Rovi, good job. Meals can be had at alfresco or air-conditioned seating. Need reservations as the restaurant is fully booked on weekends.
5
I had a lovely meal here. The juice was very fresh and flavoursome. I would definitely recommend getting the chocolate dessert, it was delicious! My waitress, Tao Ha, was very friendly. The atmosphere here was lovely. I would recommend visiting The Halia if you are in the Botanic Gardens.
5
We ate dinner at the restaurant and was assisted by Mr. Allan with a very well modulated voice . the food was superb! specially the steak and ofcourse, dessert. :) Mr. Allan showed us pure Filipino Hospitality during our dine in experience. He made sure all is well and the quality of everything we ordered was in perfect condition. Will surely dine in again when we come back to Singapore
5
Very excited to know that they are halal certified.. We were very satisfied with everything...the ambience, the food n service!! Well done and we hope to come back soon. Esp to the service staff, Musa who served us and took our order, he is just awesome!
5
She is very good staff for me.
The staff name is Ms. Tao Ha.
I'm Japanese.
From Kawamura in Indonesia.
5
Halia is situated in a rural setting. Away from our hectic city. Good for chilling out.
The food is excellent. Chicken breast does not have frozen aftertaste.
5
Very good and excellent service from the staff all round especially Truong who is very attentive and helpful. üòÅ
5
Excellent service from Truong. Staff were friendly & helpful. Great ambience, good recommendations by staff and good food.
5
One of our favourite dishes was the miso halibut, which we also had two years ago when we visited. It was delicious! The wait staff were very polite, checking in every now and then if we liked the food. Romantic, pleasant atmosphere.
5
My grandson Aidan n me have visited Halia twice n enjoyed the food. Both times we were fortunate to have Tao Ha attend to us. Her services is excellent n she is a warm n caring person. Personally brought my grandson to the rest room. She goes the extra mild for the customer. Keep up the good job n we will certainly be back for more of the good food n services
5
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in The Halia from the moment I made my reservations until i completed my dinner. Wonderful jazz live band, friendly and professional waiters as well as beautiful ambience. What more can I ask for? Best of all, it is halal-certified and kids friendly. Big shoutout to Mr Musa who was very patient and efficient with his professionalism. Love his cheerful personality. I will be back with my family soon!
5
We chose this restaurant because it was right inside the botanical gardens but as it turned out the restaurant was special in and of itself. It was so wonderful he fragrant to sit at an outside table enjoying the view and the spectacular service. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and made the most excellent suggestions based on the things we said we like. The ingredients were fresh, crisp, light and satisfying. And The dishes incorporated a lot of locally grown items like the delectable ginger. A most perfect spot to din
5
We had our wedding dinner here years ago and we came back for our baby girl 's first birthday! The food is delicious as always! Baby friendly and their service is tip top! But mannnn, that halia infused drink is super addictive! (I had 3 of that same drink, should just give me a jug mannn, hahaha) ! Ambience is serene and relaxing. We had a good time there. An established restaurant that turns halal. Love everything about it. I'm still thinking of that yummilicious refreshing infused halia drink while typing this up. Love it
4
I visited recently this place with my wife and we had lunch in this restaurant. Food was really good and we really enjoyed. My wife ordered a crab spaghetti and it was really nice. We were served by Alice and she was really helpful. A good place to eat
5
Place easy to locate. Excellent and friendly customer service especially a lady named Tao Ha. The food is superb. First time did my iftar Ramadan and it's beyond expectation. Newly Certified halal. Highly recommended.
4
Service was top notch and the food is value for money! Highly recommended for those who love nature and it's also a halal certified eatery!
5
Alice recommended the Lemongrass and ginger prawn salad and the very refreshing Masala berry drink!! Excellent taste adventure! I don't know when I have had a better salad or more refreshing drink!! Alice gave excellent service and was a delight to talk to!
5
We came here on a sunday night. The restaurant had a cozy atmosphere and there was live music which was great. The staff were very friendly and the food was delicious. Would come here again!
4
Touring the Botanical Gardens this is a nice cafe for brunch and coffee. Try the beans on toast, served with salad, poached egg and beef.
4
Set in the midst of the Botanical Garden this restaurant offers an nice ambiance and a good and varied menu. We had avacado on sourdough, topped with tomato - delicious.
5
Would like to thank Alice for wonderful service and the owners for the wonderful food. We tried Chili Crab Pasta, Chicken Breast with chicken-potato cake and Fig Ginger Tart. All was delicious!
5
We were hunting for a place to eat and shelter from the midday heat and found this little shaded cafe whilst wandering around the Botanic Gardens. Little were we to know the wonderful delights that greeted us when we entered. There were many non-alcoholic fresh fruit cocktails available We each had two different cocktails and each one was so fresh and tasty. Loving halibut I spotted this on the menu. It mentioned it was cooked in paper which sounded unusual so we both decided to try it. The whole meal was amazing and Alice our waitress was extremely helpful and very friendly. The food was brilliantly cooked and together with the lovely atmosphere, the cool shade and the tasty cocktails we continued our tour of the gardens refreshed and happy
4
Visited this beautiful place to celebrate my wife's birthday. First impression was a little disappointed as even before we patron this venue, I received an email saying they do not do birthday celebration. #1 - I did not asked for birthday celebration, confetti kinda wow celebration. So do not assume! #2 - I made reservation via online, there is a comment box at the end, so I thought I should let you know. #3 - Should ask your guest what are they looking/expecting for wonderful occasion, I could have cancelled beforehand but I did not. Food was amazingly good accompanied with great ambience. Staff was thoughtful as he advised us to seat outdoor as they was a group reservation, he just wanted to ensure we're not disturbed by the surrounding. Me and my wife enjoyed ourselves very much.
5
The food is divine, with the menu a fusion of Malay/Vietnamese/Thai tastes that take the taste buds to another level. Whatever you do, try the Chilli Crab Dip served with prawn crackers, and ask for more crackers! Halia translates as "ginger"so don't be shy to try any drink with ginger in it - my personal favorite is the Spice Islands Coffee, infused with cinnamon, ginger and cardamon. Absolutely divine! And while you're there, spend some time dawdling around the botanic gardens - but don't forget the insect repellent!
5
Good food and quite simple! Very well located in the Botanic Gardens of Singapore so easy to come with kids and let them walk around.
5
Restaurant is located at amazing location of Singapore botanic garden. Food vas very good (some pics here) and service was very friendly. Prices are fair.
5
We sought shelter from torrential
rain and encountered great food and friendly service. Try the spice island coffee and cardamom milk tea - great on a rainy day. The range of desserts is interesting too! Our waiter was Dennis, very friendly, very helpful guy!

We only stopped in for a coffee and fries after wandering through the orchid gardens but the staff were friendly and helpful, Musa in particular was wonderful and funny
5
Delicious, world class food beautifully prepared and presented. Unpretentious surroundings set in relaxed gardens setting. Excellent, attentive and friendly service. One of our more memorable global culinary experiences.
5
Chili crab pasta is good but portion is a bit overwhelming
Will come again for desserts
Good job Halia

A bit pricey but reasonable for the food you're getting and the serving size was decent. We ordered the lunch set (with complete course from soup to dessert) which was already good for 3 persons. I personally loved the fresh fruit salad with coconut cream and parsley ice cream. The staffs were also friendly and accomodating, especially Alice. She comes to us from time to time to check if we're fine and if we find the food good. Overall, we had a really good time. We wish to go back!
5
I came here by coincidence as I've never heard about it before. For work I travel the world and I've been to thousands of restaurants. I had at lunch a mango salad with prawns in a fantastic lemongrass sauce. Simply delicious. And to drink? An Orchid draca. Orchid syrup, dragonfruit and peppermint. The best fruit juice I've ever had. Strongly recommended! Friendly and professional staff in an out breathing environment. Wow!!
5
Alice, the host of the cafe/restaurant is a real nice & friendly person. I came here 4 times for white brewed coffee, she was the person that brought me in the cafe, find me a comfortable sit & take my order. Other than that, the coffee here taste aroma & you will feel yourself being surrounded by a jungle. A place for healthy mind & heart therapy place to be

I used to like Halia. A simple menu but in a nice lush location. However, when I last went earlier this month I asked for a glass of white with my oysters. "We are now Halal and don't serve alcohol sir" was the response. The menu hasn't changed. All they have done is remove the wine list. There is no mention of the fact that the restaurant is now Halal on the outside. It should be made clear to prevent people wasting their time and money. Will never visit again
5
its a great tranquil place to dine in. been there twice and surely more to come. great food great ambience! great service too!
4
Had a beautiful lunch and really appreciated the service and help from Musa. Not only did he helped with food choice but he also gave us some useful information about shopping in Singapore.
5
It's always to have a great place with tea, nice chilled tonic at an air conditioned place. Alice is a great host!
5
This is a great place to take guests when they visit SG. Not only is it located in one of the most beautiful Botanical Gardens, the food and ambiance are pretty good. Great value for money too.

The food has always been unremarkable, but the setting is lovely, particularly the open doors area, and it was always enjoyable to sip a glass of Champagne in the evening in this jungle-like setting that the Botanic Gardens offer to this place, munching some slightly weird stuff and listening to good jazz. And then, suddenly and out of the blue, the place goes alcohol-free. Who wants to munch on awkward food and listen to jazz on a romantic evening in the jungle drinking coke or tea? Anyone is free of course to make there own bad decisions, and I would have nothing to say if the restaurant was anywhere in town; I would just delete the place from my list. What is disturbing here is that the restaurant owners, for their own reasons, have decided to deprive the community as a whole of a material pleasure derived from sipping an evening glass of wine in the middle of the Botanic Gardens' wonderful environment. They should not be allowed to make this decision. It would seem appropriate for the Botanic Gardens' Management to take away whatever licence they have to run this restaurant in the middle of the Gardens and give it to a sensible restaurant owner, who will not decide to deprive the Gardens' visitors of a good time for his own personal reasons
5
We were in this restaurant 5 years ago and we remembered it by very good food and nice indian waitress. So we checked it out today and were again nicely surrprised. The waiter was professional, a bit shy, but he helped us out with our food choices. I was very happy, because they knew excatly what gluten free means and they gave me a special gluten free menu. I ordered a chowder with quinoa and it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered halibut and it was also perfect (again, since this is what he ate 5 years ago here). So would definetly recommend it! Go try it out
4
We used to go to this restaurant twice a month for brunch or dinner. However, a few months ago, they stopped serving alcohol and are now halal. If you want a nice meal but no alcohol it is still OK. We stopped going though, because they also removed their really yummy waygu beef burger from the menu. That was our children's favorite dish
4
Recently went there for a meal. There were 12 of us. The service was excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful and they were knowledgeable about the menu and they could recommend dishes which will help you to decide your meal. Throughout the dinner, they were very attentive and will politely collect the empty plates or top up the drinks. For appertisers, the truffle fries was very good and so was the crackers with crab meat sauce. The wangyu beef with Romain Lettuce was well cooked but I was disappointed with the presentation of the dish. The dish did not look appetizing. I did not fancy their plating and their plates. But the food was very delicious. The desserts were very small portions though the presentation was better than the main meal. Overall, the food was great, the service was great
1
We stopped at Halia to get a quick bite while touring the Orchid Garden. The waiter got the order wrong. We ordered a mixed salad and the soup of the day which was a tomato basil.The waiter got the order wrong bringing two salads and no soup. He then actually whined that he would have to himself pay for a wrong order. So I ordered the soup extra. Big mistake. Why wouldn't this restaurant have a Chinese soup available?Anyway the tomato-basil soup was so concentrated that it was inedible. My guess is that it is purchased as a concentrate and then diluted for warming and serving. It was thick as gruel. If it was made by a chef, send that boy back to school.My wife said the salad vegetables were C grade at best.The bill was 44 SGP $ and worth not a penny. The restaurant deserves a second chance, but not by me when there are so many great restaurants, inexpensive as Capitol Piazza Chor Mee where a delightful Chinese soup can be had for SGP $5.50
4
The ambience was really good for a family tea. When we were at the botanic gardens it was really raining and we thought it would be an ideal time to sip some evening coffee. We ordered Latte , seafood salad and some french fries for our son. The food was good and the price slightly at the higher end nevertheless at the end it happened to be a worthy spen
5
We were caught in a rainstorm and rushed into the feast aura that all wet but were made very welcome by Alice .
Food was delicious and well priced. Staff were very helpful.
5
The food was really very nice and our server was kind and friendly, the service we good and they gave us free ponchos when we were leaving because it was raining- so thoughtful!
1
Had baked beans with toast. Bread was burnt to a crisp. Baked beans tasted horrible. Not recommended. Only the poached egg was so so not great. Make you complain to the manager, they they will not charge you for it.
5
The food were very delicious and the prices are reasonable. The servers are also friendly and kind. The restaurant is very clean and the decorations are perfect.Their plating is very unique, too. No words needed when you go to botanic gardens, you have go to the Halia for a meal
4
Are the paperbag halibut and it was delicious! Staff tried the new system of getting attention by flipping a dice. We were expecting immediate response whenever we need help but the staff was slower than expected. We only realised later that it's because they needed time to prepare the food. All in all, a good and experience. Would have more of a view if u visit in the day.
5
Looking for a first class restaurant that wouldn't break the bank, we came upon Halia at Singapore Botanical Gardens, and were not disappointed ... dinner was different and superb. I had lamb chops that were sous vide, and done to perfection. My husband had fish cooked in Japanese paper ... fish melted in your mouth. So many things looked delicious. Dessert was Die Die for Chocolate ... a dark chocolate tort with raspberry sorbet. Best of all was our server, Rovie, who made sure that everything was just as we liked it. We ate on the terrace, and the sounds and smells of the garden were enveloping. Just what I was looking for on a beautiful night. Take an Uber ... taxis are crazy expensive! But go if you have the opportunity
4
We went there on Good Friday with the kids, we've been going to Halia for 7years now. Overall we had a good time but despite the very kind service I would give a 3.5 stars. We didn't care about the no alcohol policy as we went for lunch but to be honest if not for the beautiful settings in the middle of he gardens i would probably not go. Food is ok, nothing amazing. It was the brunch menu, selection for lunch was very limited if you didn't want to go for very pricey steaks or eggs variations. We had steak salads, pasta and another salad I can't recall the name. Was ok, nothing great, desserts are good but the best was definitely the mocktails ! Overall quite pricey.My guess is that the same restaurant in city center would not attract much crowd but if you want to eat in the gardens it is still the best option
1
Been there for over 4 years and the best restaurant in the botanic gardens. Booked well ahead as family was travelling from Europe and 2 hours before dinner (on Good Friday) I get this message: "Sorry this is Siti here from Halia Restaurant just to be sure that you are aware that our restaurant do not serve any alcoholic beverages. "I'm not going to argue on religious grounds... but I should be made aware well beforehand. Thank you guys!Such a shame..
5
After a lovely walk in the Gardens, we stopped by Halia by chance. The place is amazing and the lemongrass & ginger prawn salade was a real surprise both for our eyes and our palate ! Dennis also gave us very good advise for our next culinary experience in Singapore in addition to having great service and replying to all our questions regarding national customs and habits! Thank you for having us here, we'll be back
4
Went here with group of colleagues. Service was friendly even brought extra dish and extra drink for someone who did not order enough to eat in the first place.only non-alcoholic drinks such as cocktail and juices. Food is very decent, had Mango/Prawn salad followed by beefsteak, yamm
5
The Halia is in a very good setting, near the trees with a pleasant view of the botanic gardens, setting you up for a good atmosphere. Food was well prepared and delicious. The only thing I would change is the price of the meals.
5
The service was remarkable and we really enjoyed the food. The alcohol free drinks, so out of the box and prepared with passion accompanied this evening perfectly. Thanks again for the great service, you really feel special in this place.
4
We stopped for a cooling salad and cold drink on our hot, humid walk around the wonderful gardens. Great, tasty food. Very pleasant sevice.
5
I think it's great they had fun vegetarian options and not the same boring stuff! I had the couscous even tho it was meant to be a side it was really filling and tasted healthy and fresh! My husband had the chilli crab dip and he said it was amazing with the right level of spice! We had a huge portion of fries with aioli dip and some other dip I don't remember but the first dip was really delicious! The fresh juices were nice altho pretty small in size. I don't remember the prices exactly but we don't recall it being overpriced, I personally think that for the quality of food it was just right however if the food was not nice then I would have said the same as most other reviewers about price!
3
The starters were quite promising, we had the prawn cocktail, mussels and fries (nice dips). But the mains were rather disappointing - wagyu was not cooked well enough the fats did not melt; steak was alright; chicken was not well seasoned (though the curry spice was interesting). The ginger garden dessert wasn't really to our liking, it felt like a few dashes of cream and a scoop of sorbet - but I may not have the best tastebuds around. Generally not value for money, we expected more for the price. Service was good though, the staff members were attentive
2
I brought my Uncle and aunt to this restaurant where we had their daily lunch menu. And the seafood risotto was a joke. The risotto was a bed full of creamy sunflowers. Literally all sunflowers, no actual risotto. Way too creamy and I have a belly ache from it. Two words - tourist trap. Probably best to just sit and sip an expensive cappuccino rather than indulge in their pretentiously unsatisfactory food.
4
Staff was very helpful, food was great except for the Crab meat spaghetti which I find the sauce to be a tad too sweet. Was told they don't serve alcoholic drinks anymore as they're in the process of waiting for a Halal certification. It didn't bother us since we were there for lunch but I'd assume people who're for dinner will be disappointed. Not sure they'll fare in the long run since majority of the patrons are tourists
4
If you have time and love nature, sit back, relax and appreciate the nature while sipping your drink and enjoying your food. This is the place, which will get you an unique experience like in the middle of a Jungle. The food is expensive but have the decent choices. I like this place very much
4
I have been to Halia two to three times over the past few years, but the latest meal was a revelation. I went on a week night with 3 others for a business dinner. The food, refined variations of local fare, was excellent. The dessert was very good too. As we were ending the dinner, Botanic Gardens at night time was lovely. The stroll to the car park was a few hundred metres but very pleasant after a good meal. It was not cheap but probably appropriately priced
5
We were so hot and bothered so took refuge in Halia for cold drinks - iced teas to be recommended. We also treated ourselves to a Ginger Garden to share. Everything on the plate was edible and a wonderful amalgam of flavours to cool us down
5
My partner and I took shelter at the cozy Halia during a stormy rain. We had the chilly seafood spaghetti and the raspberry cake and they were perfect pick-me-up food for a rainy afternoon.
5
Its in the middle of the garden, next to the entrance to the Orchid Garden. They have air-conditioned and open air seating. I much prefer the latter. The food has always been great, specially the steak and burgers.
2
Food is okay, service poor. Looked up the menus on the web. Does not match. They discontinued serving alcohol!!!!!
4
Nestled in the centre of the Botanic Gardens, just by the National Orchid gardens is this gem. The setting is superb surrounded by all the beauty of the gardens and the food and drinks compliment the setting. One of my favourite places to enjoy Singapore at its best.
1
I have been a huge fan of this restaurant for years, loved the renovation they did and loved the afternoon Jazz they use to have on a Sunday afternoon!To the owners what are you doing not serving wine, beer or cocktails? This is a special restaurant not a quick bite cafe!You will loose your clientele very quickly.This was a great spot to have lunch and dinner to share with a bottle of wine or an afternoon cocktail! Went today and ambience was very subdued, saw many people get up and go once they were told of your policy and your poor staff having to cope with their reactions! Such a pity let us know when you change your policy very disappointed
4
Very tasty food and a great atmosphere. Order the potato fries just for the truffle aioli it is simply amazing. Total meal cost for 2 was $80 but it was worth it in our eyes as the food was good quality and the service very goo
4
Due to the location, this place is not going to be cheap and offer good value but it does offer a great location and convenience. More so when it's really hot or it starts to rain (my experience). Also good to refuel the kids if they've been walking for a while. I only had drinks and snacks so I can't comment on the food. It's not bad but if you're looking for value, look elsewhere but for the location, it's about right.
4
It was our first time at Halia, Botanic Gardens. It took us awhile to find the restaurant because we had a tough time finding the correct gate which was the closest to the restaurant. The restaurant was small but tranquil. We ordered the chilli crab spaghetti and it was yummy albeit a little too ginger-y for my liking.
5
We were delighted with the care and service by our waiter, Musa. He saw we had a baby that needed nursing and he gave us a quiet booth. The menu was varied and a little pricey but to be expected in this busy area near the Orchid garden. The salad and truffle oil fries were delicious. I would go back to try the desserts
5
Nice place to have some rest after long walk and midday sun and to have a snack. A bit overpriced, but it's obvious as the restaurant is in the heart of Botanic Garden near the Orchard garden.We didn't try a lot but a soup of the day (it was pumpkin with carrot cream soup) and home made focaccia bread were wonderful. Beverages were also good. The staff (Alice in particular) was very attentive and friendly. It's very pleasant place to come back.
4
What a great place to go sit and relax in tranquility. This is located in the heart of the botanical garden. The menu is based on natural ingredients, dishes & drinks sound delicious. I would definitely go back there and recommend it to anyone.
5
Super place to stop and eat or just have tea. An oasis in the botanical gardens to stop rest your feet,Good service,nice food.Also good for a stop for tea.
5
Food delicious. Best lunch I had on our trip to Singapore. Service was excellent as was the setting.
5
we had lunch there again, it is always a delight to go there, there is always good food and good service thank you
5
Very reasonable price too. I suggest that you stop off here for your lunch while touring Singapore. You can take in the Botanical Gardens at the same time. It's free to visit.
5
Wonderful setting in the Garden. The menu has a nice variety although they no longer sell any Alcohol. We have the Chili Crab dip, the chili crab spaghetti and the Die Die Chocolate dessert. All were Excellent I I would go back next time I am in singapore
5
We went a wonderful day at the botanic gardens and stopped for Sunday brunch at Halia. Our server, Musa, was delightful and added to the enjoyment of our meal. This is a lovely spot for brunch alone or as part of a visit to the gardens.
5
We came across this restaurant whilst walking round the botanical gardens trying to get out of the heat. Arrived at 9:45 but the restaurant didn't open until 10am (noon Mon-fri) but I'm really glad we waited. Great service from lovely, friendly, attentive staff. The breakfast we had were excellent, but be warned they are massive. Really nice Earl Grey tea served in hot cups with warm milk, so they stayed hot for a long time. They have a good lunch and dinner menu and stay open until 10pm. Worth a visi
3
Stopping off for cool drinks, we expected the mandatory service charge but then had to present our order to the cashier and carry them back to our table. It felt more like self service. The drinks were not cheap and given the venue, we expected this - but not to have bottled lemon tea filled with flavours and additives or a bottled coffee for the price . We had to ask for plastic cups to drink them from. Staff were pleasant but we were not quite sure what warranted the compulsory service charge
4
Went for lunch on Sunday after walking around the orchid gardens. Was told immediately on arrival they don't serve alcohol - we must have looked thirsty. To compensate they offer a range of fruit cocktails - both ours were delicious.Because the restaurant was busy we were seated at the bar. This was not a hardship. Drinks quickly arrived but the food, a prawn and lemongrass salad and a steak sandwich took about 30 minutes. The food was faultless and delicious. Fries accompanied the steak.As we left there was a queue with several people waiting for a table. It might be wise to eat early, around noon, on the weekend
5
The food was good and the staff very attentive. Tried both the indoor and outdoor seating options, both were very pleasant. Would definitely dine here again!
5
We were tired after having walked around the gardens for hours . Found this restaurant . The food we ordered was light but with delicate fresh flavours And delightful iced teas
5
Unique setting in the Botanic garden. Well prepared food and cocktails. Peaceful dinner. A place to take a rest.
3
"Please wait to be seated"- I sure did. Staff not busy and not observant. Finally seated (politely) and given menu which I closed and placed on table showing I was ready to order. Looking around, I observed most customers seemed to be waiting for either food, a bill or whatever. After 15mins, I decided since my order had not been taken that my afternoon in Botanic gardens was not going to be spent in this restaurant so I left without dining so no comment here reflects on the food. Purely, lack of professional service which I experienced from a staff member who was by no means under pressure
4
Visited the restaurant for dinner with the family. Enjoyed the pleasant and short stroll from the carpark through the garden to the restaurant. Variety is not the restaurant's forte. Dishes tend to have that "healthy food" taste where flavours tend to be on the lighter side with hints of ginger lily flower in almost every dish. I wouldn't say its not good, just didn't live up to all the hype for me. I will come back again just cuz the ambience is pleasant
5
The staff at the Halia were very friendly and accommodating. One of the waiter was patient enough to guide the two of us how to best approach and eat the food. Some food to recommend:The halia tea, made from fresh ginger plucked right from its gardens. It serves to warm the body and leaves a soothing effect after I finished the drink. I tried the crab meat pasta, its one of its kind, with generous amount of crab meat. Will be back here for seconds
4
We stopped here for something to drink, since it was a very hot day. It's a very nice little restaurant. Musa was our extremely friendly and very helpful server. He highly recommended the ginger tea with lemon. He told us the Singapore history of the tea, which you can get hot or iced. We had it iced. Musa explained that the ginger is local and you can actually buy the ginger in packets. It's supposed to be very healthful. It's very strong, but he provided water to add to the tea, to your taste. It was a nice stop on a hot day, and after reading other reviews, I wish we had stayed for something to eat
5
I have been to Halia quite a few times. My last visit was after a long break of not being there. And it was to celebrate Valentine's Day. Food was still very good, service was great. Like all good restaurants, the service staff are able to speak about the different dishes on the menu, give recommendations. The music was a bit jarring when we arrived, and the service supervisor promptly looked into our suggestion for quieter music to match the ambience of the restaurant. Over-ate at the restaurant! From appetiser to dessert, we were not disappointed. And very happy to recommend this restaurant
5
Best place for any kind of occasions.Amazing chef,food is 5* in presentation and flavours, beautiful patio, you can also choose to eat inside if is a hot day.Services is professional and helpful when comes to choose the best for you.Drinks are yum.Friendly staff.High recommend it.Love it .Thank you Halia@ Botanical Gardens Singapore for your an amazing lunch
5
The restaurant was full when we stopped but the hostess suggested we stop at the botanic garden takeaway and eat the chilli crab buns (made by the restaurant). Oh my word!! They were divine and were a def highlight for us. Once or twice even considered going back to the gardens to eat the buns. I would def recommend stopping and eating at this restaurant.
4
The food is good. Staff is also very friendly. Just a feedback that the table arrangement makes it a bit difficult for diners to move about without disturbing other diners.
4
Wonderful spot for a romantic dinner. Well located inside Singapore Botanic Gardens. Please drive or get a car to reach there, as there is no public transport. Staff were too professional and friendly. Alcohol desserts are recommended.
3
Went here for v-day lunch. No special decoration, just like a regilar day. Seated in an "unreserved" seat. Food was hit and miss. The ginger sauce is flavourful and tasty though.
4
All of us loved the appetiser. The Chilli crab sambal or something like that with crackers. And the smoked prawn.
5
Alice gave us very good recommendation, which are good taste and suitable for my kid. Love this place
5
Great food, and a wonderfull new zealand wine, we had to come back again before going back to our hotel, and one of the staff fixed a taxi to us and followed us the short way back, we will come again. Birgit and Leif Nielsen

We went to the Halia Villa on 14 February (Valentine's Day) to celebrate our anniversary. We opted for the buffet option and had to pay $250 upfront for it. At first look, the buffet options were few and honestly didn't look appetising. We wanted some oysters (because that was one of the big reasons we chose Halia) but were told that they've run out of it. We were very frustrated, but then someone got 5 oysters in a plate saying 'this is our last batch'. Again extremely frustrating because buffet is meant to be Unlimited. The main course was really bad, the biryani rice was cold and lumpy, the chicken was cold. Basically we didn't like any of the main courses except the crab spaghetti. The desserts were ok but quite small. Again, they had run out of some fruits. We paid A LOT of money for this dinner because we had heard good reviews, but we were extremely disappointed especially because it was our anniversary and we wanted it to be special. Will never go back to Halia. BIG let down
1
Halia used to be our favorite fine dine restaurant in Singapore. This time we were faced with the fact that the theme had been downgraded to more mediocre and one could see that instantly from the quality of the dishes to the service. Will not go again
5
This is a place you can do for special occasions as well as casual lunches with friends. It is located in the lush Botanical Gardens. The atmosphere is beautiful, the food is very good - especially recommend the Goat Cheese with Tomato Salsa. I love sitting outside with the fans going in this beautiful scenery.
4
Food was pricey, menu was unique, whole family enjoyed the food.From their warm bread to chilly crab pasta, it was a perfect brunch for our family of 3 generations.Even the grannies said that the food was good. However, do expect to pay $60-80/person.They have cosy function rooms to for events if you are interested
5
Wonderful lemon grass and prawn salad served by the delightful Alice who was charming, attentive and very helpful. Thanks
5
Love the food and attentive service rendered. Booked the place just 2 hours before the dinner, and still managed to get the reservation comfirmed.
5
It is set amongst the Botanic Gardens,
The Halia is positioned amongst the most beautiful surroundings. The excellent and attentive staff along with a stunning menu, this restaurant is an absolute must do!!
5
In a hot November afternoon, after touring the beautiful Botanic Gardens, we had lunch at the Halia. The food was delicious and the service was very good.
5
great night loved the ginger cosmo, stunning location in heart of botanical gardens perfect way to relax and show off Singapore. We sat on the balcony and enjoyed the warm breezes.
5
I have brought guests here for rats and have not been disappointed. The range of flavors served here are wide and pretty nice! I had chili crab spaghettini, widely recommended, and my friends mostly went with the baked sea bass. Gorgeous environment and the National Orchid Gardens are nearby.Only catch? Each entree is pricey, above $18 and up. Not for those on a budget
5
We tried the Chilli crab pasta and truffle scrambled eggs for brunch. Both were great, and we also bought their pineapple ginger jam as a takeaway. But the main highlight was our server, Dennis. His is an amazing story of triumph over personal adversity, ceaseless hope and paying it forward. Good food, fantastic service - won't be our last time.
3
Came here for a business dinner. The back entrance via tyressall road is the closer way and now it's riddled with construction. The signs leading to the restaurant are not clearWe could only get the outdoor seats so it's hot. Starters of chilli crab dip and prawn salad were average and overpriced. My main of lamb had the lamby smell and overpriced. They sous vided it and did that to the chicken also. Don't sous vide for just the sake of it. My friends had fish and also mentioned the fishy smellGoing to the exit to get a taxi was a nightmare as the gardens signage was horrid. Walked 5km in the evening heat in a business sui
5
We walked around in Botanic Garden then a heavy rain hit us. We used the Halia as a shelter and to enjoy food and drinks in this green and special place. Food and hospitality was great. Alice served us whole day until rain stopped. She is very charming and helpful. Special thanks to her first
5
Visited The Halia for a light snack during a wonderful afternoon at the Botanic Gardens. The quinoa salad was fresh and delicious and the marinated (in house) olives excellent. Service was very friendly and attentive, particularly by Alice who ways keen to provide everything we wanted and also gave us very useful local information. To top it all she was able to organise a search party for our lost hat and duly returned it safely. Many thanks.
4
Were there on 1st Jan to celebrate the new year with my family. We were served by Musa. He is jovial and helpful. Thanks Musa. We enjoy the food and the outdoor settings of the restaurant.
1
Set lunch menu had no vegetarian main course options. Restaurant was inflexible in substituting a simple pasta as the main course in the set menu and insisted that the courses be ordered ala carte.
5
Great location, right in front of the entrance to national orchid gallery. Weather permitting, it would be great to enjoy the patio and immerse in the lush vegetation surrounding the restaurant. Food was impeccable; we particularly enjoyed the barramundi. For starters, the grilled squid was perfectly done, full of flavour and impeccably presented. Service was great from the moment we made reservations. Strong recommendation to visit if you can and, of course make reservations. The restaurant was packed ! Enjoy
3
Went down to Halia Restaurant for their weekday lunch set. The setting and service was great, however the food was not up to standard. The slow cooked turkey breast was dry, which made it hard to chew and the steak felt old and did not feel fresh. I must say the plating and presentation of the food was great. It was a pity that the space was not complimented with good food. I would recommend trying the Asian selection, it looked better. We had feedback to the staff regarding the food quality but the staff was caught off guard and did not know how to respond.
3
Being in the land of great food, restaurants do need to do more to impress. The setting, service and whisky selection were fantastic. the food was good... not mind blowing but good quality and taste. Personally it's not a restaurant I would choose (why have European style food in Singapore??!!! with all the great local food!
5
We love Halia for its weekend brunch. The setting is peaceful and relaxing, feels like a complete break from the city. The service is rushed but ok. Food is excellent (must try the paper bag fish, avocado toast, baked beans and pain perdu). If you go by 12 you should get a table fairly quickly.The weekday lunch is a lot less exciting I felt, without the stellar breads and pastries of the bench.
5
Made a reservation on line (easy!) for dinner for four. Spent a couple hours enjoying the amazing gardens and then sat down under lovely cooling fans in a shaded open dining room for a wonderful feast. Highlights were chili crab spaghettini which was spicy and nuanced and perfectly cooked. Grilled squid Israeli and couscous with habanero coulis and kecap manis was so good we needed more sauce. Grilled greens with ginger milk were smoky and chewy. And a dessert to die for -- frozen ginger nougat with ginger crumple and pineapple and ginger compote. We were in a hurry and Allan, the best service executive in the world, made recommendations, hustled our food out, called us a cab and walked us to the entrance. He was a true gem in a sparkling jewel box of a restaurant. I wish we were here long enough to go back again for more.
5
Stopped by for lunch after a couple of hours exploring the botanic gardens. Had the chilli crab spaghetti, ground lamb, marinated olives, focaccia bread and garden salad and shared the lot between the 2 of us. It was light and delicious. Musa was very efficient, attentive and informative. Would return again
5
The biggest thanks to the Chief the food is amazing I'm really enjoyed with every bite. Thanks to the Alice she was treated us the the most precious guests of the restourant, she was very attentive to us and gave us perfect service with a smile 
4
Me and my friend with our toddlers had been to Halia for lunch. Food was excellent, especially Fish & Chips and Chilli Crab Spaghetti. Staff were friendly; one of them who served us was amazing with her friendly smile and humble nature. Keep up the good work Alice
5
The food is nice and the restaurant has good ambience. Ryan and Rovie are very polite and friendly. Good service. Good recommendation of food.

Our first visit to The Halia and the evening was delightful with recommendations made by Musa and colleagues! Love the attentive service and ambience - very relaxing and charming place for catching up with friends!
3
Food wise, one would probably call it East west fusion. They do a decent job for most dishes. The restaurant seems to have more outdoor seating than air conditioned space, so it's best to make reservations if you require air conditioning.
5
Popped in for a quick bite to check out the chilli crab spaghettini but I wasn't as impressed as others. Thought the original chilli crab dish was miles ahead in terms flavour, texture and presentation.On the other hand by 3YO's fish and chips (fries) were excellent. Very fresh fish and perfect fries. Would be nice to serve this in adult portions
5
We were lucky enough to spend Christmas lunch at the restaurant and it was an experience we will never forget!Firstly the service was wonderful, and the staff so very helpful, including our table manager Dennis Castro. Dennis was always there when needed and our glasses of water and wine were always full, he ensured we were always looked after.The food!! WOW it was so good! The buffet included everything from seafood, pasta, beef, chicken, sushi, etc etc etc, it was endless and each plate tastier than the last. This was all complemented by great salads and side dishes, which combined with the mains, and of course one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world made for an experience that will never be forgotten!!If you get the opportunity make sure you try this restaurant and I am sure you will love it as much as we did!!
4
Great attentive service, service staff also regularly checked up on us throughout our meal. Indoor and outdoor sitting options. The restaurant is located in the Ginger Garden in the Botanic Gardens so you are surrounded by lush greenery.Plenty of ginger-based items and drinks. The brunch food was good, but prices here are on the expensive side.I expected more from the Halia fushion (the Ginger Drink) but it didn't taste that special. Overall, food was so-so but the service and environment was nice
5
I brought my partner for a birthday lunch here on a Monday and had made reservations beforehand. They were kind enough to have reserved a nice table by the side as per my request. It wasn't exactly as quiet as I thought it'd be as there were mainly big families with kids but after awhile the families cleared out and it was really nice to have a quiet lunch.The food was so so to be honest for the price. I had the set lunch menu: the lamb for the salad was slightly too cooked for my liking, the seafood pie was decent and partner had the spice ground lamb which was quite good.The staff was really kind and took it upon himself to serve served our desert with a candle which was a nice touch! I mostly enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and the great service by the attentive staff there who were constantly checking on us to see if we were okay
3
Average food and bad cocktails. Ordered a lychee margarita and apple mojito and they had to remake it for us. Crab spaghetti was good but the lamb rump tasted frozen. Mussels was tiny, uncleaned and the sauce tasted like green curry. Ambience was great tho', took a nice walk from botanic gardens mrt to the restaurants. Other than that, I wouldn't return again.
4
My wife and I took time out from our visit to the Gardens to have a light lunch snack. The food was good. My wife had the prawn salad--it was good and was a very big portion. I had the sweet potatoe and carrot soup-very nice. The service was very good. A nice place to take a enjoy a meal during you walk through the par
5
Celebrated our 2nd year anniversary there. Nice ambience and the beef steak was nice! The theme of the food is ginger (as what the name Halia means), so most of the food will have a tinge of ginger flavor in them. Ordered dessert after that. The serving is quite small, but I guess u pay for the presentation as well:
5
Nice place to spend time in a peaceful place. Came here with my wife. Was pleased the way staff treated us.
Nice food and very calm place.
Must visit.
5
This restaurant has a beautiful setting, excellent service and a solid menu of good, well thought out dishes. I have been twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times, it was a lovely experience.
4
It was a party dinner and some of the dishes are too much cooked or not so excellent as I expected.
The atmosphere and location are nice though...
4
Nice food, and very relaxing location.service is quick, friendly and warm.Highly recommend for everyone.
5
I've never had a bad experience at Halia. I love the location. The food presentation exudes creativity, the portions are exactly right, and the drink selection is marvelous!
5
I have been to Hallia many times and have tried it for brunch, lunch and dinner. This is one of my favorite places to take friends visiting Singapore. The menu is delicious and creative and the staff is really friendly. You might need to wait for a table on the weekends but is really worth it. If you don't mind the heat, sit in the terrace. It's just very green and surrounded by beautiful trees. I love the chili crab spaghettini but nothing I tried there was less than delicious. Try the Vietnamese coffee (strong coffee with condensed milk). It's a treat.
5
I went to the botanical garden with a friend both from Peru and live in Melbourne. The experience in Halia was absolutely awesome. Alice was our waitress and she was so nice and friendly. The organic quinua was delicious. Definitely we will be back when we return to Singapore
5
After a tiring day filled with long walks, shopping, and more walking through the botanical garden, we stopped at Halia for their special cardamom-ginger-cinamon coffee and their amazing frozen ginger parfait. Ending the day with a full 17km walk! This place was expensive but worth the experience. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Highly recommend.Visited in Jan 2015 during our honeymoon but can't change the year
5
Spent the morning at the National Orchid Garden and lunched at the restaurantWe were sat outside under shade looking out into the Ginger garden and were served a wonderful array of food The best were the desserts Ginger and Spice and all things nice & Die Die must Have chocolate both a beautiful balance of tastes and texturesEnded the meal with a wonderful ginger drink with wild honeyA MUST VISIT PLAC
5
My Son took me here on evening after a walk in the gardens. We started with tomato soup which was the best I had ever tasted obviously freshly made followed by heritage tomato salad and spiced minced lamb. All were excellent. One week later before returning home I took a family Friend for lunch again this was excellent as the was a wait for one dish we were given a sharing plate of goats cheese and home made bread both superb. Would recommend this to anyone looking fora special meal the lunch lime does a fixed price lunch as well which I also sampled at another visit and of course a walk after in the gardens finishes things off
5
I was here for coffee with my families at around evening time. The place was quiet and cozy, ambiance is very relaxing. Not much people was around just a few tables. I would recommend the latte and the chocolate brownie. Overall i love the surrounding.
5
Good service, good food, good environment. Alice who served is very nice and helpful. The chili spaghetti is good though bit pricey but overall is great. Wifi is available too. Good place to chill post garden visit.
4
The beautiful gardens certainly help in adding to you opinions of this restaurant. The place was cool on a warm day which of course is not unusual for Singapore and the service was for the most part good - we did have to distract one of the female staff from her game on her phone at one stage to get her help. The food was ok and had potential but I'd be looking for a bit more polish in presentation. Overall ok
5
We went last Sunday and were lucky to get an outdoor table. We selected their signature drinks and found them to be well balanced. The potato soup was out of this world and not to be missed. The chilli crab was not disappointing but the only dish that was not excellent. We can especially recommend the Die by Chocolate!Don't forget to make prior reservation especially if you're coming over the weekend.
3
Though meant as a kind gesture but would really been a lovely meal if left to enjoy our meal & not kept selling in-house items after EVERY dish
5
Enjoyed the brunch at Halia on a recent visit to the Botanical Gardens. The Halia Infusion was excellent as also the Banana Bread we had for dessert. We were very well looked after by Tao Ha who was full of smiles and very attentive despite the rush. All in all a very enjoyable time
4
Myself and five colleagues visited The Halia recently. Great restaurant, beautiful setting in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Service was excellent, food was well prepared and presented. A reasonable choice of drinks and a pleasant relaxing atmosphere all made for a good night. Back to the service, our waitress was superb and very knowledgable about the menu and very descriptive about the dishes. Food was good quality and at a reasonable, medium, price range. So why not rated five, the toilets could be cleaner. Don't let that detract from the review, this is a great place for a night out with colleagues, family or friends
5
Loved dinner here!, the setting the food, the wine was superb.we had the truffle fries (which really has truffle bits in it) the chilli crab dip which is great when you want to try Singapore's famed chilli crab but don't want to get your hands dirty we also had the Paperbag oven-baked halibut fillet which was very flavourful and the special halia dessert with bits of candied ginger straight from the gardens! lovely and fresh a great dessert
4
Halia is in the Botanical Gardens and part of the pleasure in visiting at night is the ten minute stroll along the cool pathway among the plants and the perfumes. The building is of the colonial style. Our table (you really must reserve a table in advance) was in the covered outdoor deck, which is a great place to be on a balmy Singapore evening. Unfortunately, we were right next to a three-piece band so that, except when they took a break, conversation was impossible - a point worth checking when you reserve. The place was packed and the waitstaff and kitchen were obviously under pressure, so patience is called for. The menu has many attractive offerings and it also caters for children. Between the four adults, we had a chilli crab pasta, pork tenderloin, prawn salad and a paperbag halibut. And desserts. All this was tasty and enjoyable but we did not think S$340 for the four adults, including a jug of sangria and 1 Tiger beer, was good value - the food and drinks were not at a standard that justified such a high price. But it was in the Botanical Gardens, after all..
5
The dishes there are just amazing!! I usually avoid ginger but I have gone through the whole dinner from cocktail to dessert, with all of them containing ginger; and I must say, with no regrets at all! Indeed, all the dishes gave me pleasant surprises! And the service there is warm and amicable. Definitely will go back there next time
5
Had brunch and was served by Alice. Very friendly and warm reception here. Food was delicious, a little pricey but everything around this area is! But totally worth it!
5
Mr. Musa treat us very well. He not only taking order for us but also explain in detail how and what the chef prepare the food and what is the ingredient about.
4
I very much enjoyed my 'Paperbag Fish', and the courteous service from Alice. It lifted the spirits on a very damp day
5
We loved their wagyu beef burger and the fish fillet! The restaurant is at the middle of botanical garden which gives it a fresh ambiance. very into nature. the service is also great!
5
This is my second time visiting and it was just as great as the first time I was there. There's a choice of indoor and outdoor seating, with a range from small bites to large plates on the menu. The service staff are stellar, explaining details of dishes and mindful of the timing of our service. The dishes I have tried were specialties of theirs and the flavors are beautiful and diverse - the chili crab spaghettini tasted boldly of the chili crab itself, and the oven-baked halibut had a very delicate and lightly savory flavor
5
So earlier this week my second birthday dining destination brought me to this hidden Jem in the botanical gardens. Our reservations was in the evening and luckily the rain stopped and a very short walk from the carpark which we took as a lovely stroll enjoying the ambiance.Greeted by Tao Ha who was exploding with warm hospitality brought a smile to us while we were talking about our travels in VIETNAM.We ordered 3 starter dishes and 2 mains... oh boy did we get carried away or what. But the seasonings and flavours didn't stop us from finishing the dishes. Especially since the arrival of the dishes Tao Ha explained to us about the dishes which made it even more enticing than the amazing fine platings done by the chefs. Very impressed with how well the presentations were. Certainly shows the showmanship of a fine dining grade restaurent. The price for all these was just perfect and you are not going to spend a bomb for amazing food and lovely and attentive service here. Don't take my word for it, but order Hali Infusion. This drink is just so perfect and aids with digestion and refreshes you while enjoying your meal.Towards the end of the meal while I had no more space for dessert but so wanting to try their olive oil ice-cream, my birthday dessert arrives with staffs singing for me. A personal touch was a handwritten postcard from Halia by Tao Ha wishing me a very happy birthday. Thanks babe for such a lovely evening and treating us with 5* service.Can't wait to go back. My ultimate favourite was the Pan Fried Halloumi Cheese and my main which was the Halibut!!! I still dream of my halibut... Enough said, enjoy my photographs
5
Finding Halia is seeking solace from the panting and grunting amidst the 182 acres of lush forest and lakes that of Singapore Botanic Gardens, which is also by the way, heralded by Unesco as a heritage site. Halia may be on the up range but it is well worth the value for money considering the ambiance, quality of food and service not to mention the warm and friendly staff. Bi Fang and Diana were both accommodating and attentive to our needs, they made sure that we were comfortably enjoying our meal. We will definitely be coming back and recommend to friends who are visiting Botanic Gardens
4
The Halia restaurant is located within the Botanic Gardens and offers the perfect picturesque scene for a lunch stop.We decided to eat here as the food court was a little overcrowded and noisy in comparison and had a lovely table outside on the decking among the tall, surrounding ginger plants.The menu is comprehensive and allows for either light, medium or large meals depending on your appetite.We dined on the Ginger prawn and lemongrass salad and the pork tenderloin with pork cabbage.The food and service was good, although a little expensive, perhaps due to its location.We decided against drinks as even a coffee/ tea was over $7SG
3
Unfortunately this was probably our least memorable meal during our Singapore trip. The food was ridiculously expensive for what it was. The ambiance is great and the most important thing is that it is cool in there - that is the main reason we went - to get some respite from the heat.The portions were small, and expensive and although the food was good, nothing was fantastic
4
Celebrated my birthday there and Musa was awesome! We felt very welcome and he was knowledgeable about the dishes and drinks. The prawn salad was yummy and refreshing. Halibut was really nice as well. Striploin was ok but not fantastic - we've had better. For dessert we had something chocolatey with a raspberry sorbet, which was a great finish to a nice dinner
5
Good food, me and my boyfriend enjoyed very much especially dessert: Yuzu & Hazelnut. Good environment to let us have a quality time heart to heart talk. We are really enjoyed the 2 hours spent there to celebrate his birthday. Lovely :)
5
Nice restaurant and ambience, and service was very good. Thank you Alice! Will definitely come back again.
5
Halia at the Botanical Gardens is perfectly positioned for a nice lunch or drinks and tasty snacks (especially the chili crab dip!). Beautiful setting, great staff and outstanding chef!
4
Their staff were super attentive..kudos to them... Had their speciality of crab spaghetti which was not bad...loved the Singapore Sling.
The ambience is good and had a small birthday celebration for my husband..nice place
4
Nice little corner of Singapore, ambiance is beautiful and great to get back to nature. Food is really impressive, we had the fish in the bag, prawn salad and Chilli crab spaghettini - all highly commended. As a Singaporean resident, my only gripe was it's a little over priced for what it is, and a tourist trap.
3
Lovely spot to have lunch. The Botanic gardens are beautiful. However I felt that the Hokkaido scallops was very disappointing. 2 scallops sitting on a bed of sambal sauce with no flavours of spice with a scattering of blackpudding for $27 was a little expensive for the size of the meal. A extra scallop would cost $10. I feel this dish needs some thought. However the prawn salad did look very nice and only $19. The service was very good.
4
The Halia is by the Ginger garden in Botanic Gardens and not far from the spectacular national orchid collection. Although not cheap for its setting it is good. The staff are very attentive and helpful and there is a reasonable selection of food on offer. I had lemongrass and ginger to drink which was really lovely - very refreshing. A good spot to stop as you wonder around the Botanic Gardens
3
We are all very taken aback when the female waitress starts marketing and selling Halia takeaway products, she was quite persistent as she approached the table twice! We feel sorry for her and the other serving staffs that Halia had to make them do these extra task but we strongly feel that such direct selling should NOT be happening at a restaurant!!! It really affects our overall dining experience, furthermore it was my 1st time eating at Halia!
4
You get to admire some orchids on the way in as it is located near the National Orchid Garden. Ordered a set lunch consisting of salad, grill squid and lime & ginger cream tart, the Halia's Singapore-style Chilli Crab spaghettini and hot Halia fusion. I appreciate the good service. The waitress Sylvia, would check on us from time to time to ask for feedback on the food. She also gave recommendations on how to drink the Halia fusion. I loved the Halia fusion, the ginger drink on its own was soothing, not overly strong and tasted even better when mixed with honey. The spaghettini sauce was just right, not too spicy and lots to go with spaghettini. The cream tart from the set lunch was interesting and not too sweet. After the meal, we visited the provision store to check out what they had. I would definitely return to try other items on the menu :
4
Halia restaurant is one of the signature restaurants at Singapore's UNESCO World Heritage Site awarded Botanic Gardens. We had lunch on the outside verandah (in door is available), overlooking the gardens. The food is a fusion of Asian and Western influences with creative mix of Asian food styles like chilly crab into modern dishes like spaghetti. This might tricky with some people as the restaurant can sometimes be overtly creative. If you are the adventurous type, this would be an interesting attraction. The restaurant itself is housed in a hut reminiscent of an Asian long house, with very casual atmosphere betraying the more up-class nature of the restaurant. Of course the draw itself is being able to enjoy a good meal overlooking the Botanic Gardens
5
Food was delicious and lots of things on the menu which I would have loved to try. Food was presented beautifully and we sat outside in a lovely setting surrounded by palm trees
5
Alice did a Great Job taking care of us and the Food was good too. Beatifull view into the Botanik Garden Hearing the birds, it was lovely.

We had lunch after a 2-hour stroll in the unbelievable Orchid Garden at to Singapore Botanical Garden. The restaurant overlooks the garden, so the setting is beautiful. For lunch we had chili crab dip with prawn crackers, shrimp and mango salad and the delicious halibut in a paper bag. We came back the next night for dinner and had the amazing smoked prawn cocktail and chili crab spaghettini, followed by a dish of amazing homemade ice cream with a superb vanilla taste and a dish of ginger flower sorbet. Alice took great care of us for lunch and Allan was wonderful at dinner the next night. They really care that their customers enjoy the food and experience
5
I just wanted a healthy light lunch after a morning strolling in Singapore botanical garden. Shalin restaurant is right beside the orchid garden with very relax view sitting outdoor. I ordered prawn salad and cardamom milk tea, Alice served me, she is a very happy friendly lady, make me feel very welcomed and enjoy my lunch. Surprisingly the prawn salad is just daw delicious and I even bought the dressing from the restaurant, I would made salad at home for my husband and definitely I would bring him here on my next visit!
1
A forgettable experience. Food was very ordinary( kopitiam- singapore slang)and presentation leave much to be desired. It was to celebrate a birthday , thought that they would give a complimentary cake but its chargeable. Not much of an issue if most restaurants follow suit( charging for a cake meant for birthda) but its the reverse. Take your love ones and your penny elsewhere for more unforgettable dining experience
4
Had an excellent meal here during a visit to the wonderful botanic gardens. The setting is lovely and relaxing and the haloumi was delicious. Service was however very slow considering there was only one other table with diners outside. Don't let that out you off as it really was very good.
5
It started to rain so we ran to take shelter at Halia restaurant in the Botanic Gardens. Although it wasn't yet open, staff welcomed us to sit under shelter. We ordered breakfast as soon as it opened and enjoyed lovely freshly made dishes. I had avocado on toasted sourdough with tomato and soft cheese, a ginger and lemongrass infusion and coffee. All was fresh and hot and delicious!! Staff were charming and helpful and when we left Denis Castro, who had been looking after us, gave us plastic ponchos to keep us dry. A great experience, thoroughly recommend you try it
3
Chose this as a special evening to end our visit to Singapore but not quite what it appeared to be. Service was OK ish, if you asked you got but even if you'd ordered you had to ask!Food was fine although one of the mussels wasn't opened so I wouldn't eat it and hubby's chicken was only just cooked, still looked a wee bit pink by the bone to me. We were given a complimentary dessert (maybe as I pointed out an unopened mussel?) Upon departure hostess ordered a taxi and then escorted us to the exit & the taxi, so a good end to the evening after all!Quite pricey but then much is in SIngapore
5
This restaurant is located in the Botanic Gardens so you are surrounded by the lush greens of the tropics. It is a romantic spot with a varied menu and a good wine list. And it was so nice to have a quiet meal after many evenings of hustle and bustle in all other Singapore restaurants. The food was outstanding, well seasoned but not overpoweringly spicy like many places in Singapore. Service was great; attentive but not pushy. Our wait staff (Tao Ha) was patient with us and helped us work through things like portion size, food delivery timing, spice levels, etc. She is a first class, top notch professional, possibly the best we've had in Asia. Thanks Ha! We recommend this place to have a great meal
4
I brought my girlfriend to The Halia at Singapore Botantic Gardens for her birthday dinner and we have truly enjoyed ourselves there with the food, service and ambience. Will recommend this restaurant to my friends if they have a special occasion to celebrate.
5
Came back for the second time and enjoyed the brunch with my family.
Excellent service by Mr. Dennis Castro, a young man with a remarkable life story.
Put it in your plan for the next visit to the Botanic garden.
5
The restaurant is situated in the stunning botanical gardens, the scenery from the restaurant is absolutely amazing.
The food was heavenly, especially the grilled squid and crab spaghettini. The drinks and service were also delightful.
Would definitely come for a second visit.
2
I booked a table for lunch via the website for 3,30pm (the website states continuous service) but having made the taxi trip there was told we could only have drinks. When I expressed surprise - because of confirmed booking - we were reluctantly offered a menu. Chilli Crab spaghetti as good as ever. Not able to have dessert as, we were told - and could see - the kitchen staff have dinner at 4-5pm. Service was the most indifferent we have witnessed in Singapore. Fantastic location - possibly the best in Singapore. BUT exceptionally poor service - only lightened when we asked for taxi and that was actually organised efficiently
3
it still is a good option for the Gardens but Dempsey is so close and with other great options. Halia needs to make an effort
5
A very warmth and Pleasant welcomed and Very dear hospitality was presented the moment we stepped in.Personal Touch came when the owner personally served us with a bottle of wine with great hospitality too....The staffs were friendly and ushered us to take a walk around the restaurant and indeed ...it was a beautiful sight.Be there...all. A place to remember...Luv,Gordo
5
I hosted my global leadership colleagues recently in Singapore and part of the itinerary was a walk through the Botanic Gardens. I decided to end the day after the evening walk at the Halia, which I had been to only once before, over 5 years ago. Because of the large crowd (there were about 25 of us), we had to select only a few choices for main courses, so we chose a fish, chicken or beef for the guests to pre-select. All choices got great feedback from the guests, but especially the fish (paper bag oven baked halibut fillet) and the beef (slow cooked grassfed tenderloin). I chose the tenderloin, and it was the best steak I have had in a long time.The evening was a big success, thanks to the Halia experience
5
We only had some cocktails there, but they were truly excellent and very special. The fresh ginger they use is truly superb almost as if they pick it from the garden itself, and the ginger flower extremely subtle. So an excellent stop in the botanical garden that is so big that some rest is needed if you want to see at least part of it. Furthermore, they also serve great coffee and spiced teas. Since the garden is open until 12 midnight it looks like a great place to have diner as well. It has a beautiful location close to the orchid garden and in the ginger garden
5
Caught in a downpour the first time. We ran through the garden and stumbled on this oasis. The canvas sides were down against the rain. It was cozy, tropical, intimate and yet, still good quality food. Not high end and also not an attraction venue diner. Fresh food, interesting menu and mid-level pricing.  The first time (a few months back) we sat at the bar, as we like to do. They have a small but decent range of spirits and we shared the cod. It was well done and nicely presented. Unfortunately, after some brief pleasantries the bartender did not stop talking! We seriously could not get him to leave us alone. It kinda put a damper on our otherwise romantic rain-dash mid-day find.  This past weekend we returned for Sunday brunch. This time we took a table and the canvas sides were up, surrounding us in a verdant jungle. Hsb got the Waygu burger. I got smashed avocado toast and cold cardamom milk tea. His burger was excellent! (As per his report). My toast was very good. I was going for healthy and, while the bread was thick and flavorful it was a bit too much for me. The "smashed avocado" wasn't fresh smashed but tasted more like a guacamole made in advance. The tomato was fresh and amazing, which is a rare treat in Singapore. I give my sandwich an 8. It was really good, but could easily be better with fresh avo. Cardamom Coffee was cold and delicious. They serve the cardamom in a simple syrup on the side and didn't explain that all the flavor is in there. Normally I skip the sugar if given the choice so at first it was bland and disappointing. But once I figured out where the flavor was hiding (in the simple syrup) all was resolved. The waiter (I'm so sorry I didn't get his name!) was excellent. So kind but not overbearing. Very attentive but, as is the case everywhere in Singapore, you must hold up your hand to request service. It was extra sweet that he informed us the burger would take about 15 minutes and made sure we were ok with that. We decided to munch on the garlic/chili-soaked olives while waited and they were AMAZING! My secret tip: order the olives, but then use the spicy oil to add pizzaz to the avocado toast or whatever you order. Interesting menu. Unique options. Fresh food. Incredible location.
3
Didn't particularly enjoy ginger flavored food and drinks. Interesting experience, but will not return
5
Although the portions are small and a little pricey, it's worth it for the lovely atmosphere, the friendly and jokey staff and the beautiful flavours of the food.
5
We visited the Halia last year and enjoyed the experience so much we returned again this year when we were visiting the Botanic Gardens. The menu is excellent - featuring Ginger on a lot of their dishes. The staff (particularly our waiter Dennis Castro) were attentive and friendly. We weren't rushed to eat but the food came out of the kitchens quickly. English is spoken and we felt very welcomed. Will make a point of returning next year and hope to have a chat with Dennis again
4
My husband and I dined at Halia for dinner a few nights ago and we really enjoyed it. Our meals were deliciously and my pork was one of the best pork dishes I've eaten at a restaurant. I don't often order pork fillet as it tends to be a bit try however this was juicy and full of flavour. Unfortunately the beginning of the evening was spoiled a bit as the taxi dropped us off at the wrong entrance and we had to order another taxi so we were late for our reservation
4
Halia was one of the first parts of the Botanic Gardens' march to recognition as a Unesco world heritage site, opening in 2001. Of course, it uses ginger in many of its dishes, and even on a warm evening, the fans above and foliage around made for a delightful setting. The service was the best I had in a Singapore restaurant this year. Food's not bad too
5
My partner and I visited here for a 'light' late lunch one afternoon in September. We thought it would be a quick snack but it ended up being one of our favourite meals in Singapore! The mussels in the ginger and chile sauce were to die for and the Prawn & Mango salad with glass noodles was just as tastey. The staff were incredibly attentive (perhaps a little too attentive!) and the atmosphere was just perfect after an afternoon stroll in the gardens. The surroundings were also not to be faulted, sat amongst the beautiful botanic gardens. What else could you want??As I mention we only had a lunch but it would be great to come back and try the dinner menu, i;ve no doubt it will be just as good!It's almost easy to miss this restaurant if you do not know to look for it, but I would say make sure you hunt this one out and taste the array of ginger flavours for yourself
3
Service is a bit slow, the drinks we ordered came at the end of the meal, and we were charged for three, whilst we only had two. Food was good. Only average service, so average rating I'm afraid.
5
We enjoyed our meal and drinks set in the beautiful surroundings of the botanical garden - the dishes are imaginative and tasty and the drinks refreshing and original. All the staff were pleasant , particularly the guy with the beard! I would just caution the restaurant not to try to make their product 'too modern' or 'clever' as part of the charm of this place for us when we visited a couple of years ago was that it had a tropical, slightly colonial and exotic feel to it - we felt this time it was in danger of becoming a bit like a 'Trader Vic's' type establishment, which would be a shame - you have a unique product which is what people return to you to enjoy - please don't lose it for the sake of appealing to the latest 'fad'
5
What better way to spend a day in the botanic gardens than to have lunch at this restaurant. The staff were very professional, friendly and prompt. They didn't bother us all the time, but were ever watchful for a guest requiring something. The food was made of fresh ingredients and cooked beautifully. You can choose whether to sit in air-conditioned comfort of outside (under cover). Two mains and a bottle of spring water cost S$65. At least walking through the gardens will eat away at some of the calories
5
For a restaurant location isn't enough but certainly helps! Halia also delivered simple, well executed, great tasting food - all four in the party started discussing when to return.As to the location, we sat enjoying the sights and sounds of the Botanic gardens, and when a thunder storm hit they closed the blinds enough to keep us drying the outside dining area...a great experience
3
food atmosphere in the forest but food is basic : good with good sauce but not so complex or creativ
4
Tucked right in the middle of the gardens this place is well worth a visit.
Service was very quick and friendly and got a few complimentary drinks.
Lovely to walk back out through the gardens after dark.
4
The location of this restaurant is exceptional, in the Botanic Gardens, close to Orchids exhibition. You can eat on a terrace. The service is efficient and friendly. The food is ok, mixing international dishes with more local food. There is an interesting lunch set menu.
2
Went for brunch. It's a pleasant atmosphere and in general the food is of good quality. However, don't ask for your eggs over-easy. They can't do it. I sent back mine twice because they were over-hard. The third time they still were right, not running at all (they were over-medium if you are being optimistic). When you pay $26 for eggs, you expect them to be cooked correctly. Honestly, it's not difficult

My experience with The Halia was exceptional in every regard. I successfully proposed to my fiance and enjoyed a marvelous evening of authentic Singaporean food, jazz music, and the settling ambiance of the subtropical botanic gardens.I decided long before my dining experience with The Halia that I was going to propose to my girlfriend in Singapore on our Southeast Asian excursion. I found The Halia via a google search highlighting places to propose to your significant other. I made a reservation and I emailed the restaurant with my plans of proposal. When I received a response from management, I immediately knew I had made the right decision.The staff was extremely helpful via email and was willing to coordinate a chef writing a note on my dessert as well as to coordinate jazz music for the band to play for us. Upon arriving, the staff made no indication to my fiance that we had previously conversed, maintaining the surprise for her. We ordered excellent food, enjoyed jazz music, and once my girlfriend thankfully ordered us the dessert I had predicted she would, the plate beautifully had "..., will you marry me?" written in chocolate sauce on the plate. My girlfriend said yes and I couldn't be more thankful for the help of all the staff at The Halia

Located adjacent the entrance to the National Orchid Garden within the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Consider timing your visit so that you can dine here. Allow 60-90 minutes to see the National Orchid Garden and plan to exit around the time you would like to dine so that you can rest a bit after all that walking! Halia has indoor and outdoor seating. Of course it is cooler inside. The restaurant is pleasant decorated with large glass walls to make one feel outdoors even when indoors. The food is quite good and not too expensive for Singapore. Weekend brunch includes salads, egg dishes, pasta, and more.

I have not been back to eat at the Halia for a couple of years, and I should obviously have returned sooner. They really have a very interesting menu, and the items are well prepared and tasty. the service was also friendly, prompt and our server Sylvia was knowledgeable about the dishes.I recommend the Halloumi cheese, and tomato salad. The puff pastry with butternut squash was also very good. The prices are average for Singapore

Having been to the Halia at Raffles and in Hanoi (the latter unfortunately closed), we came back to the Halia at Botanic Gardens - and it was a wonderful evening again. If you haven't been here yet - then this is a total must-go on Singapore's gourmet map. If you have - then this place keeps up being great and better, so do come again.It is located on the fringe of the Botanic Gardens and surrounded by lush greenery. The decor is a good match to the green surroundings, with wooden tables, bamboo accessories, discreet light and background music. The atmosphere is quite relaxed, no tablecloths, steaks are served on wood planks. It's a perfect place for an evening with family, friends, and loved ones.And I really love it when food is the best part of what one can write about a restaurant. We went for the trademark halibut en papillotte dish, and were amazed again. It's not the most obvious, but a very inventive combination of ingredients accompanying the perfectly cooked halibut fillet: shiitake, broccoli, and shallots making it to the papillotte, with cucumber and wakame topped rice on the side. As a starter, we went for a daring but awesome salad mix of lemongrass spiced prawns, tomato salsa, and sweet ripe mango. If you're the kind of person who loves their favourite ingredients mixed in interesting ways, you will be inspired. There is a good wine list to pick from, and the cidre-style ginger beer was another interesting match for the food.Last but not least - the service was exceptional, another trademark point of the Halia's. The staff are helpful, mature, and once again made great food recommmendations. And the service quality has been consistent for years, which really deserves credit of its own. We had a lovely evening, and will be back for sure

We were visiting Singapore for a few days and were taken to Halia by our expat friends who are living in Singapore. We sat at the outdoor dining area and suprisingly I didn't have much problem with mosquitos (if you are one of those unluckky people who are loved much by mosquito, they provide mosquite repellent at your request). The atmosphere was really nice and peaceful - being part of the Botanical Garden. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Our favorite dish was the oven-baked Halibut fillet. It was a little over-priced for local standard, however it was a nice dining experience for us, to visit and catch up with old friends

Last Sunday had a family celebration birthday dinner at Halia Botanical Garden in Singapore.The soft ambiance goes very well with the lovely live band (Jazz - on Sundays) playing the numbers to the liking of select customers at the dinner on a lazy Sunday evening.The dishes were equally presentable as they were subtle in their tastes and flavors, nothing 'over the top' or excessively spicy. The food leaves a beautiful lingering taste to stay with you to relish and remember

First I would like to specify that Halia seems to have two versions of dining hall: a, very formal, indoors, apparently intended for weddings and other special occasions; and another, under an open veranda, almost in contact with the plants of the botanical garden. Our experience covers the food and service of this second hall.We were invited to come in for lunch by a kind and skilled manager. The hall as I said is pleasant, open on all sides, and at that time it was crowded.Having consulted the menu, we found that the prices were quite high, even having regard to the Singapore trends. We therefore adapted to the situation, and we ordered what looked more affordable: three "Halia breakfasts" (26 SGD each), a "Chilli Crab Pasta" and a Prawn Salad.All this, with four Tiger beers and an "infusion", for five people has cost nearly 218 SGD. The food was flawless, but we felt the value for money really low.I imagine that this is also due to the condition of monopoly-like of this property towards those who visit the beautiful Botanic Gardens

Great service esp Dennis Castro who served all 6 mummies & babies really well! Thanks for accommodating us!

Tables into the forest. Wonderful restaurant with gourmet kitchen, congratulations to the Greek chef. A little more expensive from the others restaurants that we have already visited, but probably we paid the good view.
3
Wonderfully located in the stunning Singapore Botanical Garden this restaurant should be a winner but I found it over priced and pretty ordinary. The lemongrass prawn salad was okay but sounded better than it was. Four small to medium prawns topped a bowl of salad greens, fresh tomato and mango and vermicelli noodles ($19 plus gst). But it was the drinks that I thought were over the top - $12 plus gst for a spiced coffee which was not so great and $8.50 plus gst for a lemongrass ginger infusion which was not meant to be sweet but was.The service was friendly and helpful but a bit pushy - trying to sell ordinary spice concoctions at seriously inflated prices. I liked the squirrels wandering on the fence line

My friend held her wedding at The Halia. Was privileged to get invited! I was amazed by some lemon ginger drink that was served to us. Refreshing and cool! Definitely not an usual drink. After this fantastic drink, I was looking forward to the lunch. Indeed, it was awesome!!! All of the dishes tasted great. Would love to go back here again :
5
Living in the city in a garden affords us many pleasures, Halia is one of them. This is one of our favourites. It is nestled under a canopy of trees. You can almost touch the Orchid garden from your seat. The serenity of this location makes it special. The food is fresh and interesting. We always come away energised in body and soul.
5
Great calamari to start. Excellently cooked with a hot chilli sauce. Had scallop with black pudding for a main. Truly brilliant with both the scallop and black pudding done to perfection. First time I have seen black pudding on offer in Singapore in two years. The Ginger garden desert was also memorable. Staff were very good and having the charming manager come over and ask your true opinion about the latest entry on the continually changing menu was nice. Do not hesitate, the food, setting and service made it a memorable meal
1
Avoid if you are in hurry, they can tell you "I let you sit does't mean we start business, our business hour start 12:00pm no tolerance even one minutes. Trying to order food for my kids, they simply tell you can't be help at 11:50am !!!
5
Really loved the chefs simple yet tasty creations, especially the prawn mango salad which was perfect for a quick lunch before visiting the orchid garden right in front of it. Provides both indoors air-conditioned seating or outdoors in the garden. Service is quick, efficient and warm. Congratulations also for the family-friendly kids menu

Couldn't fault a thing here. Situated just near to the National Orchid display we made a snap decision to have lunch here and we were not disappointed. From the moment we decided to go in the staff were friendly and welcoming and inquiring as to our satisfaction with everything. Our waiter Rallan was fantastic, offering suggestions and answering our questions about the food. He made sure we knew how long the meals would take, and when he brought oil and flavoured salt for the bread he explained what they were. He also checked a couple of times during our meal that we had everything we needed.The food was fabulous. The all-day menu is nice and varied with light meal and large meal options. Being in the ginger garden there is an obvious ginger / fresh influence. We chose the pan-fried halloumi from the light meals list and the spicy ground lamb from the "√É¬Øn-between" list. Both were delicious and beautifully presented. The halloumi came with a great spicy sauce which had ginger, onion, red peppers and a little chilli in it. The lamb was served on eggplant. At Rallan's suggestion we had the selection of home-made bread - 4 different breads which went very well with our meal.The food was very well presented and not only was the best meal we've had in Singapore, it was one of the best ever. The price was fair too; including a soft drink and a very refreshing ginger jive mocktail the bill came to $65. Good value for a very satisfying meal in a vibrant atmosphere. Must do if visiting the Botanic Gardens
5
We weren't going to go to Halia simply because we figured it would be touristy since it is in the midst of the Botanical Gardens. But we are glad we went. Had outstanding salad and avocado toast. Was a nice rest after walking all over the gardens ! Highly recommen
4
A tasty venue for eating outside amongst the lush vegetation of the Botantical Garden. An eclectic menu where everytone can find something to their liking.
5
Great service, food, value. What more could one ask for.
The Chilli Crab Spaghetinni is a must. Just delicious
5
Had a delicious light lunch at Halia, the lemon grass and ginger drink was unbelievably
Refreshing and not sweet. Staff excellent and Musa went out of his way to accomodate us. Thankyou.
4
The service was great, with our waitress (Ling) very attentive. The food was reasonably priced, delicious, and very well plated.
5
It's in a nice location of Orchard Garden in the Botantic Gardens. An excellent place for a romantic dinner or a celebration. Had the halibut and prawn salad. Service was excellent, food was excellent.
4
If you're looking for something a little special and different and very typical Singapore but with a twist - try this! Good food, fabulous ambience and great service. The Botanic Gardens by night make a very nice setting and this open air restaurant (indoor is also an option but why bother!) is the best way to enjoy the atmosphere. Temperatures are pleasant enough to sit outside and the menu is fabulous!
5
We reserved a table for 2 on a Saturday evening. We were very friendly welcomed and escorted to our table. We ordered about 4 bits and bites for a starter,delicious. The olives very tasty, likewise the little salad and the "bruscetta"which is an interpretation of the chef, but yummi.Also the artichokes Jerusalem. .we enjoyed all a lot. The waiters ate very attentive and asked when we wanted o have the main. My hubs had the porc, cooked to perfection and I as a vegetarian the celery with wine gravy and quinoa salad, best I ever had. The food is not cheap, but worth every Cent and the atmosphere is wonderful
5
I had been for lunch at the Halia a couple of times during a last visit to Singapore, this time I went for dinner. Sitting outside in the ginger garden is a magic experience, and the service and food continued to be excellent. Salads as starters were fresh and crisp with a hint of ginger; same hint of ginger in the Cosmopolitan cocktails. The main dish, halibut, was absolutely delicious. A place to look forward to for my next visit to Singapore
5
My girlfriend and I had one of the best meals of our life at the Halia. We had the price fix lunch for 32 dollars and the value was unbelievable. We had a seriously amazing salad, salmon, dessert and iced tea. All top notch and high quality. Additionally, the atmosphere is delightful. We ate in the breezy open air patio which felt like eating in a tropical garden. A must do while in Singapore.
4
Even if Singapore is one of my favorite city, for everything, respect, cleaning, services, kindness, but unfortunately being a metropolis the problem it's the traffic noisy...Come to Halia bring you into a breake, breatable & fresh clean air, in a word a jump into nature at 2 steps from dowtown.Good food, and really nice and friendly stuff, professional and at same time not formal.Ask for Mr. Musa and you can get a better way to enjoy your stay at Halia.Nevertheless, don't be afraid where the taxi will drop you of, even if you have to walk for a while, is it for nature you came here right?The enjoy your walking into nature, breath all odors around and don't be afraid to walk at the middle of lil Street, there is not snake or crocodile comes out from jungle on the side.Raccomanded for dinner, please there before the sunsert to enjoy nature, the your favorite foot at Halia.Garantee from an italian where the food is a mast
4
Had a lovely lunch at there, food was spectacular and fantastic service. Lovely waiter named Musa served us, he was very well spoken and friendly!
5
My son and I had a delicious light lunch - a welcome break from a LOT of walking. The prices were reasonable and the service was great. Restrooms were very clean. I ordered a Singapore Sling with my lunch and it was excellent.
5
I had the lamb. It had an exquisite taste of herbs. My mum & sister had a salad. All enjoyed in the ambiance of the Gardens under fans but their was the choice of AC for those who required it.
5
Stopped here for lunch after walking around the gardens. Our first meal in Singapore and had a wonderful experience. Staff was friendly and recommended what dishes to try. We had the prawn salad and crab spaghetti. Both amazing dishes! Lots of flavor and refreshing stop while in the gardens
3
Visit Halia for late lunch.This restaurant staff is very friendly, I ordered wagyu beef burger, hamburgers tastes nice but not worth price.Also too much french fries.Drink they recommend one is strong ginger flavor, I like but not suitable for every one.Bill for hamburger and drink is $44
5
We brought our relative from oversea for a walk at the Botanic Gardens and went to The Halia right after they open their door to welcome us in. This is our 2nd visits to this restaurant. We have ordered their free flow freshly brew coffee, some aromatic drinks recommended by the staff and a basket of breads to go along. We have a kid's meal for our little girl. When the food and drinks arrived, our little girl accidentally dropped her cup of apple juice onto the floor. Feeling apologetic, we tried to clean up the floor while our daughter was feeling upset. The staff came over and quickly clean it up for us. What surprised us is the staff gave our little girl another cup of apple juice and that really put a smile on our daughter's face. We were all impressed with the initiative of the staff. Very Good service received from this restaurant. * The squirrels are frequent visitor to this restaurant, we saw them during our last visit a year ago.
4
We found out later, that this restaurant was a sister of the one in Raffles, which surprised me. We, my mum and sister walked around the lake and then went toward the Ginger Garden, where the work is currently being commenced and decided that something to eat was in order. My mum, (80) really needed to sit somewhere in the shade and drink something cool and take some food. We both ordered the same thing, a prawn salad which was just right for lunch and one of the ginger drinks. Both were excellent and we sat outside surrounded by green plants and were gently fanned by the overhead fans. My sister ate a lamb mince, and eggplant dish which looked and smelled divine. We had no fault with the meal, the only downside, if one could call it that, was that the waiter tried to "sell" us some of the condiments which were used in the cooking. In all, it was a lovely setting in which to regenerate
4
The Halia offers a surprisingly wide menu, reflecting Singapore's Chinese, Indian, and Malay cultures as well as international dishes. Many menu items are cooked on the spot, which can take a bit of time but the technology of getting your dish to your table is very effective. The local food is tastier than the international dishes, at least based on our experience, but the restaurant is nicely located and offers a pleasant respite from a stroll through the extensive Botanic Garden. Price is very reasonable and service is efficient and gracious. We thought we would just get enough calories to continue, but the food was a surprising addition to our day
5
Halia Restaurant by the Ginger Garden in the National Botanic Gardens is a real gem. Great food...especially the chilli crab spaghettini ...from the varied and interesting menu. Not cheap but by Singapore standards reasonably priced given the quality of the food. And the delightful setting. Puds are good too
3
Singapore is a hot location in more senses than one. The weekend visit meant that it was packed with families, however that did not stop the service from being any less than good.The building was not easy to find, however its ambience was quite convivial, although it seemed to be a little pricey, but then the cost of living in Singapore is quite high. An example was the lemongrass ginger infusion and ginger flower lemon infusion drinks that cost √Ç¬£20 - a little bit spicy?The layout of this "cafe" is pleasant and there is ample seating available, despite the time of the week
5
The place was nice and the athmosphere wonderful thanks to MUSA, one of the nicest and more professional waiter we have ever met.
Friendly and funny, have made our stay a nice moment to remember.
5
Great food, and very relaxing location! We take a dinner with 2 course, very good tagliatelle with vegetables!
4
The food was quite yummy, but not the bestest.
However, you can enjoy your food and drinks with fresh air and nice atmosphere here. Quite refreshing after a long walk in humid weather.
5
Had dinner with colleagues. Food was great value. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Our taxi did not show up after dinner and Tao Ha personally took care that a taxi came to pick us up.
4
Halia is set within the Botanical Gardens so whether the day is hot or rainy, the ambience is gorgeous. Been here a few times and each time the food was delicious, each dish had an interesting twist from the norm and the service delightful!
4
What a glorious little restaurant! It was less grand than we anticipated and is more cafe style, but it's in a fabulous location tucked inside the Ginger gardens and offers a fantastic menu. We started with cocktails and moved onto seafood and mango salad starters, followed with an amazing piece of lamb with a coconut infused rice and a "fish in a bag". A nice bottle of Chablis washed it all down wonderfully. We finished our lunch with a sweet ginger pud and coffee on the outdoor terrace, shaded by the giant leaves of the surrounding gardens. Would highly recommend The Halia - it was a really lovely stolen afternoon when we both should have been working
4
It was my first time dining at Halia Restaurant @ Botanic Garden. Whilst the view is astounding and the atmosphere is 'magical'; I don't quite agree with the food. I thought the food was average.Nevertheless, the dining experience is plentiful. I have to admit that location wise is both pros and cons. It's hard to find but at the same time is rewarding... Given its special location
2
I rarely write a bad review, and I'm disappointed that I can't be more positive about Halia. For a number of years this was one of our favorite restaurants to visit for a special dinner and to take overseas visitors. The location is amazing, especially after dark, and the food, whilst pricey was a delicious mix of fusion and traditional Singapore dishes. Sadly, the last two times we have taken guests, it's been a bit of a disaster. The service was poor, with English being a bit of a problem and no managers working that evening. The menu has reduced to just one large page with a shortage of choices. And although the prices remain above average, the portions were tiny and the quality well below average. Sadly, Halia is, for now at least, off our list of special restaurants
5
So this place doesn't accept reservations during the weekend so its but scary as its a bit of a walk inside the gardens to get here. Having said not to fear, there was enough space for sunday lunch. Food was decent with an extensive brunch menu and less number of mains: their risotto was out of the world. The paper wrapped fish was also good. Very happy that we decided to come here for a relaxing sunday lunch and kids had loads of fun in the gardens as well.
5
A really lovely spot for any meal here. Some colleagues and I came here for Dinner and it turned out to be a really nice evening all the food is great and the staff are really chilled out and disappear when you want them to but right there when you do
5
Good food. Good ambiance and nice place to relax. Food was served by "MUSA" . A very kind , polite and friendly guy. Keep up the good work Musa. All the bestüòä
5
Good food comes in big portion. Very nice and relaxing setting for those who love nature. A good place to relax away from the hectic city life.
5
great place within botanical garden ( which is beautiful itself) with great food to be enjoyed outside under the ventilator.
Seafood as well as meat. The beef was great and medium/rare as it is supposed to be.
4
It's very exciting to sit down and have brunch next to a big green garden with a squirrel jumping around once in a while. Impossible to experience all this in Jakarta :)The Halia is located inside the Botanic Garden, it has indoor/outdoor seating, we of course sat outside. The arrangement is not that special but the atmosphere is really nice, the smell of greens and the sound of nature is just lovely.They have a good selection of brunch menu, not cheap, but definitely worth trying.Everything is fresh and taste really good, good portion.We walked about 1 km to get to the MRT station and good thing the weather was good (read: wasn't hot). It was a good walk in the clean and neat Botanic Garden after quite a big meal we had. If only we in Jakarta could preserve and maintain its garden in Bogor, I would definitely visit it once in a while. But one could only wish.A lovely day indeed. Recommended for Jakartans who would like to take a break from Orchard sometimes :
5
We ate here almost by accident... After taking a photo of every orchid in the Orchid Garden, we wanted a cool place to rest and have a drink and this was right next to the entrance. The drinks were delicious, the salads were refreshing (although I was expecting lettuce in the heirloom tomato salad), and the ginger ice cream dessert was fantastic AND gorgeous.
4
The Halia is in a lovely location and one of the highlights is being able to walk through some of the gardens at night. The service was excellent and the ambience delightful with live music. Price wise it's not too bad for Singapore but one disappointment was the cocktails. In our group of 5 we had to ask for 4 cocktails to be remade as they simply didn't taste as they should have. Meals were nice but portion size a bit small. Overall though it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
5
We had our wedding there and everything is perfect! Highly recommended  From day 1 speaking and liasing with Lydia, she has been very helpful providing options for us. Then Mazni took over and she was fabulous, very accommodative and promptly response. During the wedding, the event IC Jeepy John again has done an excellent job. He offered helps all the time just to give us a stress free night.
4
The restaurant is located in the midst of luxuriant garden. You could well enjoy a walk in the garden before the meal.A conducive place to connect with friends and loved ones. A inspiring place for the artists and the floral enthusiasts. Our American friend loved the Irish beef in particular and we ordered Asian foods. The service was commendable.We would surely come back for more
4
This was my second time back in Halia as I had an awesome experience the previous time. On the second round, food maintained its standard - never fail to impress me. However, staff knowledge on menu was mediocre on that day. Bill was also charged wrongly. There were ants all over the table even though this time I was in the aircon dining area instead of al fresco. Asparagus soup was on the salty side - would be great if there's some improvement. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this place and will definitely come back again.
4
We have been there in the past with a friend and was superb. So we were in the Botanic Gardens and we thought to try again, it was weekend and they have a brunch menu. We ordered one beef burger and one salmon risotto; beef burger was great, meat, bread, french fries everything...but the risotto wow!! Outstanding when they brought the meal I thought it was the prelude of an epic failure because the presentation doesn't look at all to a risotto but the flavour...terrific!! Absolutely a must if you try this place.Service is extremely good compared to the average in Singapore, they are nice and always looking for you to have a nice time there.
4
Lovely little restaurant situated in the beautiful Singapore Botanical Gardens, simple menu with several tasty options.
5
Apologies that i took 2months to write up this review. As my friend did his proposal at Botanic Garden on March 26 2016, we book a number of 22pax at Halia to celebrate this joyous occasion. I would like to thank all staffs especially Li Bifang, supervisor for the service rendered to us and ensuring that all food meet up to our expectation. She even went to the extra mile by placing name tags on our table to better ease their staff of serving the right food to the right customers. Many thanks for the awesome service as it's never easy to deal with customers especially those in big groups. Therefore, thanks for the patience and hardwork! thank you! (
5
Lunch here after the orchid gardens. Service was excellent, the supervisor Aalia was onto every detail. Excellent menu and food and yet very reasonably priced for the quality. Everything from presentation to attention to detail was spot on. We will definitely visit again when next in Singapore. Best meal we have had here since arriving.
1
We waited for hours to get our food. But the time everyone got food our cracker were no longer crispy - pasta were cold. We had to complain about how slow the service was. After the Long wait the food was very bad. $90 each without alcohol. Rip off!

Halia at Botanic GardensNestled within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the outdoor seating offered by Halia amongst the foliage is a fabulous setting for a meal. Together with the wooden patio outdoor seating area, you feel like you are having a supper in a tree house. The service, ambience and the quality of the food make this a favourite restaurant for me.

I went here with a friend on her last day in Singapore, and it was a lovely way to spend the afternoon before her departure. You are in a cozy place in the middle of what feels like a tropical forest. The menu is limited, and expensive, but the food is fantastic. And with the experience, I do find it worth it. We also had these deserts and they were fabulous. It's a lovely experience with friends or a significant other on a lazy weekend morning :
5
Very good restaurant for dining in unusual place. Food is delicious. Deserts are awesome. Atmosphere is smooth and relaxing. Very quiet. Great place to go there with your family. Personnel is friendly. Special thanks to Musa for looking after our Daughter and making our evening very comfortable.
5
Had a fantastic lunch while spending a few hours at the Botanic Gardens. The menu is full of interesting choices. The Ginger and Lemongrass Tiger Prawn Salad was wonderful, so was the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio and the Mango Mousse for dessert. All dishes were beautifully arranged. A very helpful and friendly service have made this lunch a truly remarkable experience. Definitely a must while visiting the Botanic Gardens
4
The restaurant boasts a significant repertoire of ginger dishes. But if ginger is not your thing they have other options as well. The food was impeccable and the service friendly. We had the tuna starter and the vegetable in a pastry pouch for lunch and dessert was the Death by Chocolate and the the Other Bay. The desserts were out of this world. The prices are on the more expensive side but overall worth it. The staff also organized emergency ponchos for us as it was raining and we needed to leave, which I thought was very hospitable of them
5
I just happened to come across this restaurant in the heart of Singapore Botanic Garden after an afternoon walk with a friend. Who would have thought of a great restaurant right here in the middle of the forest? Without any doubt, my friend and I went to try. The restaurant is very charming, surrounded by a mini-forest. As the darkness enveloped the evening, we could hear the insects sounds from the surroundings. It's just peaceful, communing with nature right in the middle of the city.Then we looked at the menu. Well it's our first time but just one cursory look at their a la carte dishes, I had the impression they were all delicious. Since we just came from a walk, we asked for recommendation for something light. Thus we settled for some salad, puff pastry and chicken. We were not mistaken with our choices. They all came in great presentation and simply delicious. In addition, we also had the lime and ginger yellowfin tuna kinilaw for starter as I was expecting it to be similar to the Filipino dish kinilaw, only to be surprised with a superbly unique presentation. We ended up emptying all our plates. It was a superb experience and I am sure I will come here again to impress a friend, guest or anyone special
3
Good place for breakfast only, will be too hot if you will to go there for lunch. Cost of the food still acceptable.
5
Atmosphere is natural, secluded, and comfortable. I deal for a private date or dinner and nestled in the Botanic Gardens. Service was solid and meals were all tasty.
5
Called in today for a drink after a lovely wander around the Botanic Gardens in 35 degree humid heat. Excellent stop made more pleasant by our waiter, Dennis Castro, who chatted to us and made us feel really welcome
4
The restaurant is located in beautiful setting in the botanical gardens. To enjoy sitting outside I would suggest going in the evening. It was too hot to sit outside so we moved inside, which feels more cafe style. The food was great. (Not a lot of choice for the time we went lunch) The food was all good. Except the artichoke and potato which was not eatenDefinitely recommend.
4
Sporting a raging hangover from the previous night, a trek round the Botanic Gardens in 30 degree heat wasn't top of my list of things to do on a Sunday afternoon. However in doing so I discovered the best hangover cure ever; the absolutely delicious Wagyu Short rib Rendang on Toast at Halia. Super friendly service from our waiter Dennis and some killer Bloody Marys soon knocked my hangover for six. The main dining area is a very pretty space overlooking part of the Ginger Garden - it really is worth a visit, hangover optional
3
Stopped in for lunch following visit to the lovely botanical gardens that morning. Very disappointed with what we got for the price paid. 330 ml tiger beer served tepid was SPD12. We also had 2 starters (mains were too expensive) which were decent enough but really tiny. Mainly our own fault for not checking out the menu before sitting down. If you want an expensive, ok quality meal in an admittedly very nice setting then this is the place for you. Staff were helpful enough
4
Nestled setting in beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Site is itself praiseworthy. Service by Dennis Castro was engaging and heartwarming. Steaks were nicely done, enjoyed the sweet venison curry with papadam and kinila
4
The Botanical Gardens are clearly one of the biggest attraction in Singapore. To complete the experience, The Halia, is a great place to stop for lunch or brunch. Ginger in-fused lemonade, the very popular salad with prawns, the tuna, everything is light & fresh, totally in harmony the exotic environment of the restaurant. It's a tad on the pricey side for the food but the atmosphere is unique. All in all an incredibly relaxing experience, especially after walking the Gardens in the heat
4
Worried that we'd be bittten by mosquitoes after a downpour but found ourselves in a delightful open air terrace cooled by overhead fans.Don't worry if you're driving. Easiest car park is on Tyresall Road off Holland Road (opposite Dempsey Hill). Surprise dinner which offered me the chance to sample their chilli crab dip, cheese and bacon bread and Spicy lamb loin in curried wild rice with coconut and ginger. To die for!Lovely spot, great service. Can't wait to return on a Sunday afternoon for live jazz
4
Very enjoyable dinner. Had the combo of chilli crab spaghettini with a Singapore Sling by Hendrick's, which was very good. (and alcoholic!) Wish I had gone earlier (arrived around 21:00), as some of the dishes had sold out. The table service was excellent and am embarrassed to have misplaced the name of the waiter who really made the evening special (I do recall that he has been there for 3-month's to date, if this narrows things down and provides credit to the gentleman whom has earned my praise

I have been to Halia many times. The location inside the botanic gardens is lovely and it is a perfect and relaxing spot for drinks, lunch or brunch.
5
We got a small meal, french fries with truffle oil and another dish that I can't recall the name, it has pumpkin on it.
5
This place is really nice! I ate the mango/tiger prawn salad, the ginger lamb and a ginger desert - all dishes were super! Great location in the middle of the gardens which gives a cool ambiance. I really recommend this place!
5
This restaurant is in the middle of the botanical gardens. The have and outside area and also a room with AC. The food was just excellent and the service as well. It was a little bit pricy for me but totally worth it!
5
The location at the botanic garden is fantastic. The food was delicious and the service of our Vietnamese waitress Ms. Ha excellent. For us this is our favorite place to eat in Singapore.
4
All good. Great dishes but would have loved less 'brunch' menu items at 2.30pm and more real lunch options. But all in all: great location, friendly staff, nice plates
4
Service by Musa was exceptional and much appreciated for. Enthusiastic, friendly and his promptness to provide his customers with maximum dining comfort at Halia has been most impressive. Such service standards are a rare find. Thumbs up!
5
The atmosphere, theme, service and food at Halia are all fabulous. It is an ode to ginger, with a selection of ginger-infused food and drink. Our server, Musa was knowledgeable and well-informed about the food, friendly, and funny. I would thoroughly recommend the sous vide steak currently on the specials menu, as the meat and accompanying artichoke are fantastic. Halia has jumped to the top of the list of my favourite restaurants in Singapore
5
The Botanical Gardens are a must for visitors to Singapore but so is the need to take time out and sit in the shade ! The Halia provides a perfect setting - a cool, shady interior, an extensive and delicious menu, a bar guaranteed to quench any thirst (and don't forget that water is a side-bar must in that heat!) and a lovely team serving you. If you visit there, please say a hello from me to the very likeable Dennis Castro
5
We were hot and bothered, the kids were overheating so we decided food and drink was the best option. We opted for the air cooled room at The Halia, the ambience was wonderful and in a beautiful setting. Our waiter (Musa) was well informed, friendly and simply brilliant with our two girls/us. He took us through the menu, explained how the dishes/drinks were made. We were very impressed with the quality of the food, not forgetting to mention the refreshing cool drinks that were much needed.We ate out a lot during our trip and sometimes the food was hit and miss. The Halia on the other hand was definitely worth it, so if you're looking for somewhere to eat/experience/a touch special...with great food and service...The Halia at SBG is worth the jaunt.Thank you Musa
4
Our first time to Halia and it's a wonderful surprise. Delicious food with a great band at the background. Our server Jim is professional, attentive and always carry a smile. Will recommend this place to friends and family.
4
Nice cool evening with lots of greenery. Excellent service with good variety of dishes, unique cocktails / mocktails and dessert.
5
located inside the ginger garden, can enjoy the good view with dinner. quiet and breezy, full of oxygen. The Chinese waitress (studying in Taiwan) is very sweet and considerate. Food tastes good, ribeye steak is tender and juicy.
4
After a couple of hours in the orchids we were delighted with this find in the Botanic Gardens.Our waitress was welcoming, informative, and interested, the mocktails we chose were fresh and refreshing, and the food was just right. Modest bill too.We will return soon
5
this is my 2nd time coming here, this time i just brought my husband to celebrate his birthday. we went to movie night in botanical gardens (swan lake)-was so fun ! then we strolled down to halia and enjoyed their ginger-inspired cocktails. i got a singapore sling and hubby got herbalicious halia--both excellent. dessert: die die must have chocolate--a serious choco overload! the cacao nibs tuile were very interesting--they were snap crackling and popping-basically having a party in your mouth, be sure to try. ginger garden was interesting-it has an edible garden component, all very different and trans formative desserts. certainly will come back!! also--service was excellent! be sure to sit outside, lighting is so nice and if you get a cool night-will be amazing. sun nights--there is a live ban
5
We truly had a lovely time: food was truly good, desserts were awesome and our waitress Tao Ha was just taking excellent care of us. She provided us very good advice, ensured we were happy and was always anticipating for what we were looking for. Do not miss the Sunday band : they are terrifi
5
It was a hot humid afternoon when my sisters and I dropped into Halia for lunch after a walk at the Botanic Gardens. But we were pleasantly surprised that the foliage and ceiling fans effectively blocked out the heat even though we sat al fresco at the patio. Service from all staff was excellent. Reception was warm and prompt. The supervisor waiter Dennis Castro was on hand to see to it that we received the best service and recommendation that Halia could offer. Service was attentive but never intrusive. The set lunch was good value for money, combining herbs and ingredients that brought out the flavours in a refreshing way. Kudos to the Halia team, especially to Dennis who is beaming with enthusiasm and initiative
4
Although it was quite difficult to find the right entrance of the garden due to numerous road work, you rapidly feel peace and wisdom in the garden. After a walk through, you arrive at the restaurant. The place is comfortable and so peaceful that you can really enjoy a meal and conversations of fellow invitees. The food was simple but of very good quality. Service excellent, always around and at disposal but still discreet. Will not hesitate to retur
4
The pros : tables available both inside and outside depending on your preference. Nice selection of dishes, most of them based on ginger. Good cocktails and mocktails. The cons : place requires a bit of walking from the main entrance, which can be problematic in case of rain. A new car park was opened nearby but most taxi drivers don't know it.
5
My boyfriend and I had dinner at Halia for my birthday and we both agreed that this is probably one of our favorites. My BF made a reservation and when we arrived the staff who was waiting on us addressed us by name with was very impressive. Loved the Asian twist on all the dishes and the very innovative and unique incorporation of ginger in their food. Although some of the dishes were on the pricy side, it was definitely worth it. My BF got the cod fish and I had the Singapore chili crab pasta. The cod fish was cooked to perfection. It was light and flavorful, literally melts in your mouth. The chili crab pasta was really good however I would prefer it to be a little more spicy. As it was my birthday (they even remembered this even though my BF casually said it over the phone as a passing remark when he was making the reservation) , the staff stopped my BF on his way to the restroom to reconfirm that it was my birthday. We ordered dessert and my plate had a birthday greeting on it which was very sweet. The all the staff were very professional and welcoming. It was such a great experience and I'm sure we'll definitely be back !
5
This is excellent cuisine in the central place in the gardens. Very good service. Is very popular and can be busy - so may be a short wait for a table
4
Saturday brunch was wonderful. The Wagyu burgers and cinnamon french toast were exceptionally delicious. The staff was helpful with our gigantic twins pram. A wonderful rest place to grab a bite among the beautiful greenery of the Singapore Botanic Garden.
5
Proposed to my then girlfriend (now fiancee) at the Halia with the help of Faisal and the rest of the team. They gladly obliged to craft "Will You Marry Me?" in the dessert plate and helped in keeping the flower bouquet beforehand to surprise my then girlfriend. Had the signature Chilli Crab Spaghettini (which is very fragrant), Riverine Tenderloin, truffle fries, and Singapore Sling. Overall had a wonderful food and service experience. Thank
5
Would I return? DefinitelySpecifically liked: The freshness, scents and colours on the plates were matched by the gardens surrounding the restaurant. Relaxing atmosphere and comfortable setting.Biggest Opportunity: Though the timber tables were clean and suitable for the natural setting, the experience may have been even better if tablecloths were provided
5
Halia is a place I visit regularly (at least 2x per month). Great for lunches after a morning walk at Botanic Gardens, my favourite dish is their signature Halia Chilli Crab spaghettini, paired with a refreshing lemon grass. One of the hidden gems in Singapore and I highly recommend this place
5
Perfect place for getting a break surrounded by the Jungle: having a drink, Lunch or Dinner there will make you forgot the intense urban life of the city a few minutes far away (10min by walk crossing the gardens from the subway station). Really nice and tasty food with one of the nicest service . One of the best place in town
5
We had superb food here when we visited and I wouldn't say it was drastically more expensive than a lot of other places are, our choices seemed on a par price wise.This made for a great stop during our Botanic Gardens visit. We had a table outside (covered) and sitting alongside the foliage with a breeze flowing through enhanced the experience
5
Excellent service from a charming, chatty waiter. Chilli crab dip, good, as per usual. Grilled Romaine Lettuce with wasabi was a treat. Paper bag halibut in a superb broth was excellent, as was the spice island lamb. Lovely surroundings finished off by a stroll through the gardens to the MRT. 4th visit, it won't be the last
5
4 of us met for lunch on the terrace at the restaurant. We started with a sensibly priced Australian sparking wine that tasted delicious. For our main courses one of us had Chilli Crab pasta dish, one had a fillet of Halibut en papilote, one of us had a vegetarian dish with puff pastry and I enjoyed a fillet of lamb cooked to perfections with a curry rice base. There were 4 empty plates which I guess says a lot. For desert their ice cream was thick and delicious. The person who chose the chocolate dish was very happy and the ginger pudding was all eaten. Throughout the meal the service was very attentive but not intrusive. For a venue inside a well known location we were all very impressed
3
Very nice cafe in the garden, but unfortunately it's completely overpriced, small portions, misleading names and quite average service. Their special Halia tea with ginger and mountain honey was very nice though...honestly I am not a harsh reviewer, but it is a big shame for such a beautiful restaurant location
4
Great food and pleasant service - however on the more expensive side, rather small portions - but the place is nice and after a stroll in the gardens a perfect place to relax
4
Freshly prepared food. My light salad was delicious as was the tomato and basil soup.
Mains menu looked very inviting especially the venison. Friendly attentive staff and delightful setting.
4
We went for an early afternoon walk and decided to sit somewhere for a snack, and happened upon Halia near the Orchid Gardens. It was very busy, so we assumed it was popular for a reason. We were not disappointed. We split the wagyu burger, and it was by far the best burger we've had thus far in Singapore. Can't speak for any of the other menu items, but we'll be back for the burger!
4
Excellent range of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks available. I would recommend the mocktails. Freshly prepared, delicious, refreshing and inexpensive. Iced water brought to the table before making choice of other drinks. Staff very helpful especially Musa who also obtained warm water which he recommended for a cough. It worked!! Overall a very pleasurable visi

I have been to Singapore Botanic Gardens for several times. But it was my first time to dine at The Halia restaurant there. We ordered oysters (quite small, not creamy enough), truffles fries, Halia's Singapore style crab meat chili spaghettini - this dish is acceptable, grilled Romania, venison curry with papadum and gingerflower sambal chicken, these dish were acceptable as it was valued for money and ginger garden dessert presentation was good. We also ordered chicken rice, guess what happened...a few pieces of chicken meat, shredded cucumber√Ø¬º≈íwith a teaspoon of puff rice on a big plate. Kindly rename the dish as it will ruin the reputation, how much is the rice costs? Why dun serve proper rice? My friend and I ordered this dish, we were so utterly disappointed. The birthday girl had to share her chili crab spaghettini with me. Same as my other friend, his girlfriend had to do the same thingy. The waiter took the a feedback form to me. I wrote my comments. The manager saw my comments, she came to approach me about the chicken rice dish. I told her my view. She was nice to waive our Chicken rice bill. The waiter did explain to me before this dish but the name of the dish "chicken rice' was really misleading us as we really expect a decent chicken rice.
5
my wife and i decided, after so many visits to Singapore, we should walk the botanical gardens,we got a little hungry half way round and found this gem Halia,the staff were great,albeit you can't book but the food was just great.we had the burger, which we shared as huge but tasted great and the a nice lunch in the middle of these beautiful gardens was perfect.they also do dinner,which looks great
5
I really was not expecting the food to be as good as it was here.... But I'm glad it was, it really was fantastic. We went on a Sunday morning/lunch and there seemed to be some sort of brunch menu on offer, but regardless I was very happy with my beef burger and my girlfriend was equally happy with her salad. Quality and taste was excellent, service was also very good, and the surroundings were lovely. It's not cheap (for western prices) but it is very good value for the quality of food you get
3
I booked dinner at the Halia at the Botanic Gardens based off of some good reviews on TA. So went with high expectations.First up - the location is fantastic and a nice change from restaurants in tall buildings.The menu was quite varied, and the sweet venison starter was the highlight for me (with the ginger flower sambal chicken for main which was ok). The food itself was quite pleasant overall, but nothing too out of the ordinary.Service was also a bit mixed, we were welcomed and settled quickly, but then we seemed to get overlooked on a couple of occasions, when trying to get dessert and drinks.The price wasn't too bad (this is Singapore) - overall it was a nice place to eat, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be
5
We visited the gardens in January 16 in a party of six. We stumbled upon the restaurant and we were very interested in the lunchtime set menu which was very reasonably priced. The menu was available up to 2pm and it was about 5 mins away from that time. No problem and we were soon sat indoors at a lovely set table whilst a tropical storm raged outside. The atmosphere was great. The menu was very good, three course and coffee. The food was amazing and was fine dining at a great price. We had a wonderful lunch, made especially so by the lovely Vietnamese lady by the name of Tao Ha. She served and entertained us with her local knowledge and good wit. She was a delight. When it was time to leave the rain still poured but Tao kitted us all out with plastic rain ponchos so we could continue our exploration of the lovely gardens. What a great place
4
I was surprised how good this restaurant was, because I did have a pre-judged feeling that it will be one of those who boasts a great setting but compromise their menu quality. But I was proven wrong - the menu is creative and the wine selection is decent.A few of us had the Singapore Crab Spaghettoni - and it became a fast favourite.This is a great place to go for date nights - or just to have a good night out for dinner with friends and family.The lighting is a bit too dim though, so we couldn't stay too long after several bottle of wine or we'll lose our momentum of going eleswhere for a nightcap.Service was attentive, professional and efficient
4
Went here with my parents after a walk through the gardens. A refreshing little place, gorgeous views and great food. I had the set menu, very delicious.
5
The Halia never fails to disappoint - superb food, service and ambience! It is definitely worth paying for. You might have to make a reservation!
4
Tried the wagyu, cooked perfectly!
The surrounding is filled with green plants, making it a comfortable meal in the garden.
4
We came here each time we visited Singapore. The restaurant is situated inside the botanical garden with beautiful plants surrounding the dinning area. It's quiet, away from the crowd and provides a very enjoyable dinning experience. The only surprise was that the Ginger Flower Sambal Chicken that we ordered had no starch (eg. rice, potato) or vegetable accompanied the chicken. It was very tasty, but the dish seems too simple for the price they charge
4
Passed by here today looking for lunch after the Orchid Garden and although the menu look very tasty, the prices we thought were a tad over the mark, so settled for a sandwich from the shop just around the corner.I think they need to review their prices a little.A note to make, there is also a function and wedding centre associated with this facility which would be a lovely setting for any major happening
5
My colleagues and I dined at your beautiful restaurant the other night and had such a great time. We really enjoyed the hospitality! Chan Myae Thet was out host, she really looked after us. We loved the lemongrass drink and favorites were the truffles fries and the steak! We look forward to another great dining experience soon.
5
Besides the Halia, means ginger in Malay language, I love this restaurant as they can offer you varieties of herbs as the main theme or ingredient for your preference. The Halia also a friendly restaurant for vegetarians, vegans or gluten fret diet required people. That's way I like it very much!
5
This is an overdue review of our Christmas 2015 experience at Halia. The food and service at the Sparkling Brunch Buffet were outstanding. It‚Äôs better each year. We arrived at the early seating starting at 10am, and sampled every item on the buffet. All were delicious. The assistant manager Diana made us feel very welcome. The serving staff, as always, were attentive and polite. With it‚Äôs lush greenery, the setting is peaceful and relaxing. We‚Äôll be there on Christmas 2016, too
5
We sat down after walking around the gardens and were a little surprised at the price of much of the food (we were on one of our last days in Singapore and were trying to make our money last). We felt a little bad as we ordered no drinks and ended up getting the soup of the day with a side of homemade foccacia ($8 soup and $4 bread - most menu items are $~30).The tomato and basil soup was the best soup either of us have ever eaten, it was perfect. The homemade bread was also delicious and great dipped in the soup. The bread came with 4 pieces, and the soup came with 1 too, so it ended up being a very fulling meal for $12. The waiter kept filling up our glasses with ice cold water and was an incredibly friendly older guy.Overall we absolutely loved this place, and ended up eating on the cheap (it wasn't very busy as it was a wet monday so we didn't end up feeling too bad).Highly recommended, and if you have the budget, I am sure their proper meals would taste amazing too
5
First time to The Halia, even though the restaurant is located in the middle of the Botanic Garden, it is not that difficult to locate it. Greeted with a friendly server at the front. Was served by awesome servers with friendly staff who made sure that everything went okay and was constantly attentive to us. Not to mention, the food was also worth the price. Will definitely visit the place again!!
5
We had a great lunch, tasty food , relaxing environment and excellent service. Really enjoyed tomato salad with gazpacho (light and refreshing).
5
We passed by this restaurant with my family during the walking in Botanic Gardens. The food and service was perfect. I strongly recommend you to taste the fish "halibut", tomato salad under the gaspacho greasing. Don't miss it when you walking trough ....
5
Was really happy after almost 2 hours plus of walked in the park. Had a good rest with light music and a nice afternoon tea set to fuel me up. Tastefully designed, a great place to have your afternoon tea surrounding by greens.
5
Quite apart from the beauty of the botanical gardens, this restaurant provides a superb resting and refreshment venue. We went there for 'brunch' and the service was excellent and charming. The food was very good, truffled scrambled eggs and those that chose the Cinnamon French Toast did not stop praising it
5
We went to a wedding. The ceremony was scheduled to take place in the bandstand in the gardens. The name Halia means ginger.I loved the ginger and lemon grass non-alcoholic cocktail. The pumpkin soup was much better then one I had at another (supposedly fine) restaurant a few days later. The salmon was perfect. The high point was the ginger dessert, crunchy and flavourful. Staff were attentive. The minute you looked up and gave a wave somebody rushed over.  Your car or taxi leaves you at the end of the drive so not ideal for anybody who can't walk. Set lunch price includes coffee but not the 10 per cent service nor the 7% GST
5
The Halia restaurant is set in the beautiful botanic gardens, it is not pretentious in any way. A wonderfully relaxed atmosphere with incredibly attentive service and simply great food is what we enjoyed. Joe and Rallan looked after us brilliantly. We started by sharing a tomatoe salad.....sounds dull but it was alive and scrumptious . Then my husband had a smoked salmon risotto which was new on the menu and was simply delicious. I had a great Angus steak cooked simply and well with the quality of the meat shining through. We then had a yummy banana bread pudding and coffee.It is not cheap but you are paying for the ambience and our food was great.Thank you to everyone that made our lunch so special
3
F&B 3,5 Service 3, Location 5Menu 4Promotion of the month for wine was sold out on the 7th already and we also did not get the alternative wine we ordered but another one, without notifying us.Nice Singaporean dishes
5
Beautiful food, much of it featuring the flavour of ginger. Who knew what a sweet and subtle taste ginger could have? My lamb was perfectly cooked, while my girlfriend said the halibut was one of the best fish dishes she's ever eaten. The dessert was a work of art. Oh, and don't order the truffle fries unless you want to consume a whole plate of them in five minutes flat - they're that moreish
5
My boyfriend brought me there to celebrate my birthday and it was an extremely great experience. Although it was a long way walking in, the setting of the restaurant in the lush greenery of the Botanical Gardens was worth every sweat. The ambience was perfect and the band played beautifully, allowing a dining experience that was both chill and fun. They also sang me a birthday song when my boyfriend presented me with the cake. The food was great; I am deeply in love with the way the mushroom soup is served and the broken bruschetta was to die for. Loved the duck rillette as well! For the main, we had the paperbag halibut fillet. Service was relatively pleasant, staff were attentive and very friendly. I would love to go back again even if I am not in the vicinity
5
We went to the Halia while it started to rain heavily. The restaurant is pricy, but the food was great. The biggest plus is the friendly staff! They are very polite and as we asked where to buy a emergency raincoat, they gave us two for free
4
Nice restaurant next to the Orchid Garden. Food was good (I had noodles with prawns) and service efficient.
4
The staff gave a good advice if you didn't have an idea. They were friendly also. And the atmosphere is very good.
5
We discovered this restaurant only because it was raining & it was truely a great find- fabulous food- I had the prawn salad- great flavours followed by the chocolate desert which was to die for- hence it's name & such lovely staff!!!

Located within the lush greenery of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, The Halia, is a fine-dining restaurant that serves up dishes that use a key ingredient ‚Äì ginger (which is what the restaurant is named after, ‚Äòhalia‚Äô means ginger in Malay.It was fortunately for us that day that it had rained earlier, resulting in a nice cool air enveloping us as we were seated outside in the outdoor area. :) We were so near nature that we spotted an adorable bushy tailed squirrel running across the beam! We had about 20 people in our group, and we were waiting for one of our party to arrive. However, while waiting it took the wait staff more than 15 minutes after we were seated to take the initiative to give us bottles of chilled water and asked us what we would like to drink. Thereafter, it seems like they wanted to ‚Äòdrown‚Äô us asking us whether we would like to drink after every meal. It didn‚Äôt help that they were also slow on serving up the bread (slices) which were a little miserable ‚Äì literally one slice per person on the table. And not to mention we were almost done with the bread did the vinegar (to go with the olive oil and bread) arrive, almost another 10 minutes later. It also didn‚Äôt help that the vinegar was only given to the first table and not passed down the table. The salad was served in a relatively large bowl with lots of leafy greens topped with mango bits, slices of fresh succulent prawns and rice noodles. It was a good appetizer and opened up the appetite for the next course. Soup of the day: It was an odd concoction of potato and spinach. Not one of our favorites of the night. I had the Whole grain-fed stockyard tenderloin with garden salad & pepper sauce and the beef was tender and moist, complimented well by the pepper sauce with accompanied it. Once we were done with the main, the dessert soon followed shortly. It was an in interesting concoction of ginger and spice with pineapple bits presented in the form of a nougat, which was a bit like a cross between ice-cream and whipped cream. It was light on the palate and definitely lived up to its name ‚ÄòGinger & Spice, All Things Nice‚Äô.Overall, food wise I would say that it was good, but service still needs to be improved a little (i.e. more coordinated). If your pockets are deep and you want to experience good food in a lush green setting than do give 'The Halia' a try
1
We booked the Halia for Christmas lunch as mother in law was visiting us for the first time since losing her husband of 56 years earlier this year. It was the location that sold it to us as we could get up and have a nice walk if emotion got the better of my wife and her mum. The traditional Christmas lunch was awful and was not worth the money. We sat down at 3.30pm and started to enjoy the free-flow wine. There was a good choice of meats at the carvery but it was all cold. My wife tried lamb but it was almost raw. The turkey was cold. The beef was cold. We should have had pasta! The vegetables were indescribably poor. Roast potatoes, roasted in goose fat, were cold and soft. Brussel sprouts were massively overdone and were burnt! Gravy was cold. There was not one thing about this 'traditional Christmas dinner' that was any good in any way. Coffee at the end of the meal was not included and we paid the bill and went to Muddy Murphy's and had a wonderful meal for less than half the price of the Halia
5
We had a very pleasant lunch here while visiting Singapore's World Heritage Botanic gardens. Halia is Latin for ginger as the restaurant is in the Ginger garden, and ginger features strongly on the menu. Lovely food, including a very welcome light menu with many appealing salads - the tiger prawns were great! Top food and quick, competent and friendly service. And good tropical infusions - ginger of course! - and mocktails/cocktails. The Singapore Sling is cheaper here than at Raffles Bar, (Halia has a sister restaurant at Raffles). The restaurant seems to be very popular with locals And is popular for weddings - easy to see why.
5
Had lunch here and was pleasantly surprised by the quality ofthe food and the friendly staff, especially Sarahanya. Often restaurants in this sort of location is average at best, but this one is excellent. Discovered afterwards that tey also have a restaurant in Raffles..say no more.
5
I would like to thank all Halia personnel, and especially Mazni and Hetty for organizing our wedding dinner at The Halia at Botanic Gardens. We had so much of help during the whole process of organization and on the event day itself! And everything went so smooth, we even didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything! I am very happy we have chosen Halia to celebrate our special day, awesome location among nature, and really great service. Thank you again :
4
A great place to wind down after a walk in the Botanic Gardens. My second visit here. Nice food and drinks. Family friendly. My first visit was with family and second a solo one. Love the place and the food. Does get crowded though on weekends especially and at meal times too. Great place to hang out for tea as well
4
An experience you will never forget eating and seeing the Botanic Gardens in Singapore. I absolutely loved it. The dish we had at the restaurant was unforgettable also it was this puff pastry with butternut squash with greens on top with feta cheese, it was really good and I have even made it here at home after eating it. The restaurant was nice inside and waiters very nice and patient. I just wish they had more options for vegetarians
1
The food sucks.
For the price that you're paying, just take a short walk to its neighbour in the Botanic Gardens.
5
Stopped for lunch during our walk around the botanic gardens. Expected just cafe food but were pleasantly surprised, great service and reallllllly yummy food.
3
Once we were seated, the staff will ask for your name and subsequently they will address you by the name. The restaurant has a nice setting up and nice environment.
4
The food at this place is very good. However, if you're really hungry, the portions are rather small. Do avoid the place during peak periods as it can get extremely crowded especially when it's raining.
5
Great location in the middle of Singapore's Botanical Garden which is a treat by itself. The restaurant has a beautiful terrace where friendly staff is serving fresh delicious and tasty food, lovely drinks and tempting sweets. One of the best locations in this wonderful city.
5
The food is excellent and the food with the live music is more than you expected. Additionally the environment is one of the best in Singapore. You can enjoy the outside also because of the fans.
4
We dropped by after visiting the orchids (with a reservation, after all this is Singapore) expecting typical caf√É¬© food. It is much better than that, with an excellent choice of light offerings, salads, seafood. After walking our feet off, it was lovely respite. Friendly service, the staff couldn't do enough for us without ever intruding.
2
Definitely disappointing. Menu has mainly seafood which does not fit into surrounding/ambience. Staff is not attentive, more busy with themselves than guests. We had live music which was so loud that no more conversation was possible at the table.It looks like a romantic place, but it is not. Be warned.quality low, prices high
4
The beauty of Spore is that there have very well up attractions and they do very well in exploiting their attractions. Halia is one , a restaurant in the beautiful gardens of Botanic gardens. We dined outdoor for a group of 30pax. It was very nice as we can enjoy the greenery and good ceiling fans also ensure we were kept cool and comfortable. The staff were really good, friendly and helpful. Food was also very good.
5
My wife and I visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens on the second day of our holiday and kind of stumbled upon Halia by accident - I think there are some other dining options in the gardens but Halia is definitely more "high end" and we fancied a treat so we got a seat inside (we needed the cool of air conditioning after the heat of the gardens!).Cocktails were good (not amazing, but well made) but the food was awesome - my wife went for the raw tuna dish and I had goat cheese mousse with tomato salsa and rustic bread, and we shared some truffle fries. OMG THOSE FRIES! We've never tasted anything so good! They were by far the best fries we've ever had - if you visit Halia, DO NOT MISS THEM. They're cooked to perfection and the cheese and truffle dressing is sublime.I think there's another Halia over at the Raffles Hotel, which I assume is just as good. This was one of the dining highlights of our holiday, second only to the truly stellar Bacchanalia, so if you're in the Botanic Gardens and you want a knockout meal, don't hesitate to check our Halia
5
Great little spot, friendly service and tasty and well presented dishes! Had the halibut and prawn salad. Would definitely visit again, as it's a nice break from the heat!
5
Beautiful ambience & surroundings.
Tucked in a nice spot at the Botanic gardens.
Service was excellent.
Food was good but lacked variety however dessert was very good.
An excellent place for a romantic dinner or a celebration.
4
Love the place! Good drinks & food! The atmosphere is just amazing. Thank you- we will come back for a city break soon!
5
It's in a nice location of Orchard Garden in the Botantic Gardens. I took a taxi here and the taxi will drop you off at the Tourist Centre and then it's less than a 10 minute walk.The restaurant offer a two course lunch special or three course lunch special.  This is by far the best service I've received in Singapore.I will certainly be back again

I decided to stop for a nice, cool, relaxing sit-down meal at the Botanic Gardens, and this place was perfect. Had a light fare ginger tiger prawn and greens salad for S$19 and an iced latte. Service was excellent (some tables are communal, had a nice conversation with a British couple), food was excellent. I was not rushed. Given prices in sit-down restaurants in Singapore, the restaurant prices were not a surprise

Dined here one Sunday with my son and wife and we had fabulous time raving to each other about our meal, ambience and the service. We felt closer to nature by dining alfresco as indoors can be quite cold. Will definitely take my family back again when I'm back in SG. It's been awhile so I hope nothing's changed. See you soon

good for taking a rest in the middle of rambling under the scorching sun.I had a slight cold at that time. what I choose for beverage is "halia infusion" which tastes like sweet ginger and made me feel better for sore throat. The atmosphere of the restaurant was exotic but still too hot at terrace.
5
A cool refreshing atmosphere, ably presided over by the friendly and efficient Faizal and Ha. The food is clean and fresh with delicious and unusual flavour combinations such as in the pulled duck leg salad and heirloom salad. We were particularly pleased with the variety of vegetables contained within each dish, in a country where meat and rice/noodles usually dominate. Our favourite dessert was The Other Harbour which is a feast for the eyes festooned with colourful edible petals. The rich creamy citrus and mango combination lives up to all expectations
5
Great experience indeed! Wonderful setting with gardens all around you. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace as in the evening it is not that hot anymore. Also a very rich and inventive menu. And I was especially happy to find light meals that had local flavours and as we ordered several of the items it turned into a beautiful dinner bouquet. Allan our waiter was very knowledgable, suggested drinks, gave good explanations about the menu items and when we were leaving even made sure we will find the right way to exit the garden as it was already dark, he gave us very clear directions. On a separate note the Botanical garden becomes magical at night, so if you are having a dinner at Halia you should also then stroll in the gardens inhale the fresh air and enjoy the light up paths and trees
4
I absolutely love the ginger (halia) tea here! Keeps me warm and comforted. Set in the midst of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the ambience is also fantastic here. I have tried its main course too, like the chilli crab spaghetti. It is delicious. However, it is the ginger tea that lures me back to this place again and again
5
A good combination of Wonderful food with top-notch service from all of the staffs especially Diana, Mae, Sarah, Faizal and for those who i can't remember their name ;p
5
It was our first time and not just the quality of food is great, more importantly are the staff. they are all friendly and courteous. Special Thanks to Faisal. world class service .
2
go here for the location, not much more; the service is poor and the food is average; prices are high, though
3
I arranged for a Japanese couple (elderly) to have their dinner in this restaurant 5 years ago. I personally experienced excellent food and service prior with my husband. The couple expressed : this is one of our best dining experience!". However as time passes and the restaurant is better known, service drops and the food is not as good as it used to be. is this the labor crunch or is it really difficult for restaurants to keep their quality and service level over time? I no longer go to this restaurant
4
Had lunch here... Food is wonderful and friendly staff who recommended starter to go with the Main. Did not have to wait very long for the food to be served and best is that the place is situated inside of the botanic gardens and can go for a walk after your meal. Halia is a Malay word and it means ginger and majority of the food has this unique taste. I had the chilli crab spaghetti while my partner tried the Alaska black cod . Would be back for dinner in futur
4
I chose to eat at Halos in the botanical gardens after I reviewed the menu as I prefer to try out local cuisine and its variances instead of the traditional tourists pizza or burgers.At the restaurant, Ha reviewed the options with me based on my preferences and recommended options. The service was quick, food fresh and drinks were refreshing.
4
After the sensory overload of the Orchid Garden and with a desperate need to escape the haze due to the fires in Indonesia we ventured into Halia for lunch. It was a relief to sit down in the cool and although the menu wasn‚Äôt explained we finally asked if we could have the dishes on the breakfast menu. The answer was yes and we thoroughly enjoyed the smashed avocado, goats cheese & chilli on toasted sourdough and the saut√©ed brown mushrooms on sourdough. The ginger and lemongrass infusion was an instant reviver and the coffee with ginger, cinnamon and cardamom was a success. We were given a voucher for a discount at the associated shop so we could bring home some ginger to make our own version of their infusion. It was not a cheap lunch, around $70, but it was delicious
4
Our experience at The Halia at SBG is one of those rare occasions where an ordinary customer such as us would be treated extraordinarily special. And it seems this goes beyond usual dining experience as the staff have taken on the extra mile in rendering their service. We wish to thank and commend Faizal for warmly welcoming us to who and what Halia is, and introducing us to the menu as if the chef is speaking what the food is about, how you will likely perceive it, what is their recommendation, and why is it recommended. He also took a proactive step to ask what could be the occasion why my wife and I are having dinner, and as a customer, we felt important as he took interest and time to make a connection, not just communicating. So far all the dishes he has recommended were superb, in particular the prawn salad - a real must-have not only to open palate, as he said, but to please it as well. The chili crab spaghettini is an experimental treat and, risky to me as it sounded, it was a revelation in taste - on this I fully trusted Faizal's word that it is not spicy that will scare me off - this one is truly a must-try without regret. And now comes the dilemma on the dessert, as my wife, so biased towards cakes and pastries, could not find a cake in the menu. We thought we would be closing the bill when she just thought to ask Faizal if they have cake but not holding our breath on it. He replied there is and he could get her one - cheese or chocolate? Astounding, we never saw it coming as he said the cake is not on their usual menu. Lo and behold, Faizal comes out with plate of chocolate cake overlaid with nuts with a surprise candle, and a warm "Happy 20th Anniversary" inscribed in chocolate icing. Plus, he gave us a card with his name and the Halia team commemorating the same. What else does this guy has in his sleeve that will just surprise you? My wife and I thought visiting the Singapore Botanic Garden is already interesting, for a change, to celebrate two decades of our being together, but this experience was a memorable one that sealed a really fine ordinary Friday evening into an extraordinary one. It is a such blessing that someone took it upon himself to make you special even without you having to ask for it. Very simply, my wife and I would want to go back and dine there again. Eugene & Tricia SantosOn their simple 20th Wedding Anniversary dinner which this Faizal in this restaurant made specialSingapor

Probably could not get a better view or ambiance for dinner in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the botanical gardens and so when you eat outside you are literally sitting inside a tropical forrest. It is absolutely beautiful. Sitting outside is not an issue as there are overhead fans. The food is ok but the setting makes the place. The food is more western orientated and mixed fish, meat and chicken menu. Service is good and friendly
5
Been here three times and have never been disappointed. Great location, very good service and food. Chilli crab pasta was very tasty. Broken bread bruschetta very good starter. Went on a Sunday when there was a live Jazz band. Some in the group found them a bit loud for comfortable conversation. Get a table inside if this could disturb you.
5
About time here was memorable for us, we like this place a lot, a beautiful green space, fresh air and the food is absolutely superb.
3
Just passed by the Ginger Garden with my family. We enjoyed the chili crab pasta & their signature drinks. Down fall with the staff attentiveness.
5
We ate here as a group of 20 at around 9pm. This is a great time to eat as it was slightly cooler and there were not many other people in the restaurant / gardens.Halia is nestled in the Botanical Gardens and is a prime spot and is really lovely.The waiting staff are very attentive and kept our drinks topped up.All the food was bought together and was all hot and very very very tasty. Eveyone mentioned how much they enjoyed the food.Our table waiter / host was an Austrailain? guy who knew the menu inside out and explained the food / specials / drinks well and answered any questions and looked after us very well! I had the full rack of ribs which is one of the nicest meals I had in Singapore.This restaurant is a must to visit in the evening
5
Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday there with her friends and their weekend brunch food is simply magnificent. Their main courses was great as expected and their desserts are to die for! Thanks for the excellent and friendly service too! Thank you Rallan and Faizal for the great recommendations
4
This was a friend's daughter's wedding and this entrance to the Botanical Gardens is less frenzied than the others, probably because it's a bit of a walk from public transport and it's a one way street. The setting and layout of The Halia (ginger) - in my opinion - manages to pull off the appearance of a forest setting quite convincingly without the accompanying tropical nuisances. This is aided by the presence of the friendly staff: thank you!As for the food, it was nice but since this is a wedding, value considerations do not apply ;-) so YMMV
5
Even though we showed up at 3:30pm, we were welcomed and lunch was still served. The truffle fries were yummy, chilli crab pasta should be tried at least once, vegetarians would be delighted with the tofu tower, washed down with the iced Halia infusion (refreshing ginger drink with honey). If you like dessert, then try the mango mouse (with pomelo, mango, yoghurt sherbert). The service was lovely, the staff are attentive and helpful
4
Went over to the restaurant after walking all over the botanical gardens. The ambience is lovely and the staff was attentive. I had one of their set lunches (2 course). The food was good, but doesn't quite merit the price tag. A dish I particularly liked was the Gnochhi with pea
3
We had lunch. Last time my friends went there the raisin toast and berries were amazing. This time it was a big slice of tasteless sweet bread. I had a breakfast. The elements were tasty individually but together it was dry. Needed juicy tomatoes. The prawn salad was fabulous
5
I love the Halia at Singapore Botanic gardens. Located just next to the Ginger Garden and Orchid Garden and close to the Symphony lake, it is quieter than the other botanic gardens options. Great natural decor (wood, muted earthenware etc) and with the atmosphere of a spa resort in Bali this place serves wonderful food. I have visited many times and never had a bad meal.Cocktails and mocktails are great with a lot of delicious ginger themed options as well as the more traditional choices. Food is fresh, sometimes quirky, well presented and with good portions. chilli crab linguine in particular is yummy.Service is great, they will almost always give you a feedback form which means they are continually seeking feedback and trying to improve.Love everything about it. Hope it continues to maintain this standard
3
had dinner with two friends in September, after a nice walk in the gardens. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, good service but average food vs. the price tag. We tried the salmon, chili crab spaghetti and noodle salad. Would go back for drinks and atmosphere.
4
We had our appetizer in the lunch set today. Even though, it wasn't quite up to my liking, the waiter Fansal was great. He wrote a card to apologise and offered a salad in return. Awesome service and good ambience. A good chill out place!
3
Nice menu, enjoyed the chill crab spaghetti , but it was overpriced, the service was good and the staff pleasant
4
This is a nice, well positioned and charming restaurant. I had high expectations due to teh way people waxed lyrical about it, it was good but it wasn't amazing. Happy to return again if I am in the Botanic Gardens.
4
Had a business meeting here and ended with lunch in the Halia restaurant at Singapore's beautiful botanic gardens.
The surroundings are beautiful and very relaxing. We had a set menu as a large group but it was delicious and the service was fantastic.
Highly recommended.
4
It's outside of Orchid Garden with nice environment surrounding with plants. Sitting outdoor is not hot at all. There is light menu available for lunch. I tried the tiger prawn salad which was very tasty.
5
Great food the best ginger dishes and drinks. I really love the lemongrass ginger infusion great in the warm weather. The service was friendly and fast. Keep up the great ginger menu and add a ginger mojito!
2
We were a group of the company I work with and had a fixed menu.The first plate they served was regular in everything (taste, presentation, etc.)... Then we moved to the main course and asked the head of waiters to please bring my salmon seared...When the waiter arrived they were over cooked and dry...Call this guy again and nothing happened, call the manager... Finally after more than 40 minutes my salmon arrived.... Wouldn't return to this restaurant
3
Nice stop off along our walk in the gardens. Orchids are one of my favorite flowers so I naturally had to come and enjoy the orchids. Beautiful place with trees, grass, flowers and plants, as well as exhibits, walking trails, and picnic area. Accessible by subway/bus
3
Very peaceful and relaxing place. It is a good idea to walk in the Botanic garden and finish your evening in the restaurant in the middle of the garden. The place is excellent, but the kitchen and the prices are not so. The prices like in high-level restaurants, but the dishes are very moderate. I think that the kitchen good me better in such a beautiful place. By the way - no wifi access
2
This was a disappointing revisit to a restaurant we had been before. Dirty tables. Extremely small portions at lunch( no menu salad options). Two guests were served first, the third had to wait 15 min for exactly the same dish. For three soft drinks, one ice cream and two minuscule salads the bill came to $90. Best avoided
4
Great food. Love the crab. Good place to sit back with a cool drink in the Singapore humidity.
Nice break after walking around the orchid gardens
4
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore - and very convenient after walking through the Botanical gardens. The chilli crab is a fantastic, it is also great value at lunch time during the week.
5
We dived in here having come out of the beautiful Orchid Gardens quite hungry & as we did the heavens opened! Alan served us, explaining about the food as it arrived & chatting in general. I chose the halibut, which was sensational. One of the nicest meals I have had - served steamed in paper, in a broth with Japanese mushrooms & broccoli, with Japanese rice & a truffle mayonnaise - delicate flavours, perfect portion size & absolutely gorgeous. I sent my compliments to the Chef. Hubby had lightly smoked salmon on a bed of cauliflower with a smoked cauliflower soup & loved his too. Dessert was a gorgeous chocolate & raspberry medley - you can't go wrong! I had the Ginger Garden - beautiful! Delicate & complex flavours to savour & so pretty. The Halia infusion - a ginger & honey infusion is wonderful too.When the bill arrived we were pleasantly surprised given the calibre of the meal - about √Ç¬£75 UK including a glass of wine & a pint of beer. The environment is lovely, comfy & cool, surrounded by the gardens, & with a slightly spooky quality when it rained. Excellent service throughout the meal, & as Alan realised that we really loved the food he was happy to expand on its history & composition, asking our opinion on portion size etc. Overall - very glad we stopped & we will try to come back - thanks guys

I went to botanic gardens last weekend, walking for a couple of hours and finally we can stop here and eat our lunch. We ordered a chili crab pasta, it was nice but it will be even better if its spicier. They only have one type of pasta, we mushroom soup which is soup of the day. It was too watery and dilute. The bread that comes together with the soup is nice, it taste very strong of herbs and olive oil. Too bad the soup wasn't good enough. Other than that we have truffle cheese fries, it smells good, but fries texture is dry... We still finished them cos too hungry. Besides they also serve fish in a packet, salad, all day breakfast and liquor. Nice environment to chill
5
Interesting menu, perfect "rainforest" setting in the ginger gardens. Food is good, prices are adequate and service meets the expectations.A dish that really surprised me was the Jurong Griglegs with porridge. It was part of a menu otherwise I would have never chosen this but sit was absolutely fantastic.If you have bad luck there are loud Chinese weddings in the neighbour building, the will spoil the tranquil night noises from the "rainforest" I'm the botanic gardens.Enjoy going here and have visited it 4 times for dinner and have also visited The Halia restaurant in Hano
3
The Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens is overpriced. Menu has interesting choices but then taste is something else and the presentation of the food is quite ordinary. The only time I would suggest to go to this place is if you happen to be at the Botanic Gardens and don't want to go anywhere else out of the way to eat
3
The location is excellent withing the Botanic Gardens and it's great to eat outside there. Some mosquito bites are difficult to prevent though. But that's OK when you're having a good time. We found the food to be very good, slightly overpriced, very helpful staff I must say, and the menu was a bit too limited for our taste. Still it's a good place to go once and try it out, but I will not go again as the competition in Singapore is so high and there's better places to be found within this price/quality category. Other than that you'll probably like the food very much
2
The only reason I gave this a 2 star is because of the beautiful location. First of all portions are tiny! We walked out hungry! Items come no where near the appetizing description on the menu! You will be very disappointed when your food arrives. We went for brunch and we were early and when we asked for the burger they said they ran out. We ordered an avocado spinach salad, it should really just be called spinach salad as there was exactly one small bite of avocado. Also don't be fooled by their "tiger" prawn! They are tiny shrimp cocktail! And on top of that they slice them in half to make it look like a bigger portion when ur only eating paper thin prawns. Rest of the food was also very disappointing. For the prices they charge at halia I recommend you go somewhere else! Just not worth it anymore
2
Visited with my family. This restaurant has gone from best to really bad. I personally visited to review if i should do a big business lunch here, after this visit, I say forget it. Pumpkin soup came with seeds. Tiger prawn salad came with mini prawn (they claimed it was a small tiger prawn which didn't look anything like tiger prawn). Avocado salad came with 2 slices of avocado. Very disappointing experience all around comparing to my last visit last year..
5
I enjoyed dinner with colleagues there this week. I loved the natural setting of the gardens as well as the interior/exterior design of the restaurant. Service was great and food was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the crab soup starter and the spring chicken. Good choice of wine and other drinks. I wouldn't mind going back there for another leisurely meal or afternoon tea
5
The restaurant has been renovated since our last visit, but the memories, excellent service and food, and the perfect ambience has not changed.
5
The nicest part about halia is its location, right in the heart of the botanical gardens. While the menu didn't have a lot of choice, everything we had was good.
5
The pasta dishes were awesome. The garlic bread and breadsticks were great. Wouldn't recommend the Singapore noodles.
4
We went to this scenic spot for lunch, its located in the Botanical Gardens so the setting is excellent. The food is also good and presented nicely, however, the options for vegetarians are very limited indeed.
4
Nice restaurant in the Botanical Gardens. Peaceful, very good food, and nice selection of healthy meals. A bit pricey, but the ambiance and environment of the Botanical Gardens makes it a nice place to enjoy a relaxing dinner.
4
Due to a booking error last Valentine's Day we were unable to have lunch at Halia but Sarah promised if we were back in Singapore she would look after us. We were given a wonderful welcome back by the staff and looked after superbly. A cocktail was produced and a dessert with welcome back to Halia written in chocolate on the plate. We enjoyed the experience so much we returned that night and listened to a great jazz band with singer and had another delicious meal. Not to be forgotten!
5
Superb services, service staffs are friendly and knowledgeable, as the place is crowded during weekends, do be a little patient for the wait to be seated. :) Wonderful brunch I had and top up with their refreshing lemongrass drink in the midst of lushful greenery not forgetting a cute squirrel that ran past me by the fence...
5
Recently back at the Botanical Gardens and revisited Halia to escape a downpour. Had been there 18 months ago and had a less than comfortable experience- icy aircon, anticipated menu unavailable at the time... bit disappointed because it was an occasion :(This time we were heading for cheap eats at the railway but the rain diverted us and it was a most happy diversion! The lunch menu isn't huge and isn't cheap but it was brilliant quality! This time we chose to sit on the verandah and watch the wind and deluge from there. Good choice- and this time the waitress warned us that it was very cold if we sat inside.Mains were excellent, fresh and light sashimi style tuna kinilaw, truffle fries, an unusual and delicious bruschetta and superbly dressed heirloom tomato salad. With three of us we shared and enjoyed everything. And then came dessert!The die, die must have chocolate is just the best chocolate dessert I remember ever! I didn't order it but tasted from my husband's plate. The combination of flavour bombs- the raspberry sorbet and crispy dried fruits with chocolate done several different ways and the varied textures in each element of the dish was enough to take me back to Singapore from Oz. I know where I will send any future visitors and I wish we'd just had dessert on our previous visit. I did also order a dessert which suited my lemony palate - mango, pomelo, sherbet, lime. Brilliant!I am sure this experience was coloured by having had a great wander in the orchid garden and amongst the gingers for which Halia is named. Plus being a lovely unexpected surprise to ourselves it was one of those serendipitous events which will live on in my memory. Other times- drinks hours, evenings etc. I cannot judge and to each their own- but for our lunch, I guess you can tell I enjoyed
5
We decided to eat at the Halia at the SBG on a week night at around 6PM. There were few people there when we joined, but the atmosphere was calming and fitting for the beautiful garden surrounds. We ordered the singapore chilli crab spaghettini, prawn and ginger salad, and chilli crab dip with truffle fries. Everything was very tasty, the salad was seasoned well and the flavours were perfectly balanced. These dishes were recommended to us by the waiter and they did not disappoint.Overall our experience at The Halia at SBG was exemplary, the service and environment was relaxing and tranquil, the food was excellent, fresh and well presented. The only downside is the location can be difficult to access as the road near it is one way, and taxi's are hard to find(we used an uber in the end). I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who enjoys tasty fresh food and a tranquil causal dining experience
3
We visited this restaurant 2 years ago celebrating a birthday. It was a wonderful evening. Great food and atmosphere.Visited again a few days ago. Again to celebrate a birthday. Very disappointed. The food was still excellent, but the restaurant has gone down market from two years ago.Not somewhere to go and celebrate. A great pity
4
Good food, great service.
I had the sterloin steak while my partner had wagyu burger. The mash potatoes were amazing and the steak excellently cooked.
I recommend those that are planning to go for the steak to take it with the ginger seaweed butter sauce.
4
Nice afternoon tea hangout with friends. Love the high tea set with local flavours - chilli crab as one of the items.
4
Halia is just next to the orchid gardens. The pricelevel seems like it is influenced by that location.
Anyway the Chili crab spaghettini were good, the goat cheese creme was very delicious and I recommend the Ginger Jive.
4
The place is beautiful complimenting its nice surrounding scenery. The food is prepared with thought and tastes great. Highly recommended.
5
Mostly on holidays I'm bit reluctant about seafood but at Halia we've tried smoked salmon with cauliflower and turmeric sauce. Delicious, only needed bit of fresh bread to wipe the plate. Highly recommended.
5
Tropical setting, great food with mocktails and juices spiked with ginger. Refreshing and mid-price. Always popular, waiting times of 20-30 minutes can be expected
5
This is the mix that Halia offers to its clients. It's a pretty good proposition.We got married here in 2014, came back months later for dinner to find all the staff providing one of the best restaurant services we've experienced in Singapore, from the moment we got seated until we got the bill, everyone ensured that we had a great dinner. Sunday would be a good time to visit for dinner as they have a live band playing. You should book in advance for dinner over the weekend. Not a cheap place, but a service to match
5
Have eaten here twice. Menu gives option for something light around 18-22 SGD, or something more substantial at about 36SGD or so, prices as at late July 2015. I had a tiger prawn salad which was very nice and quite filling. They provide water, which is a nice touch. Building is sort of dark wood modernist with plenty of glass as viewed from the inside. Setting is amongst the ginger gardens and they add some ginger to a few menu options. Five star value is given in the context that Singapore is not a cheap place to eat. Expect to pay 14-18 SGD for a beer (ouch)
4
I'm not a big fan of fusion dishes. But I must say that Halia has done it pretty well. Ambience is casual n relaxing to begin with n the service staff is attentive. We were quickly ushered to a table n served chilled water to quench our thirst. Menu is simple n yet varied. The range of variety allows the fussiest eater to be able to pick something. Most of the dishes have the element of East meets West. Food n drinks were up to expectations n will definitely return again to try other dishes. If u r looking for a small bite, the chilli crab dip is s must try
4
Went for tea with grandparents (90+) but they don't have a tea set! However they have a great selection of ginger themed drinks and a chocolate cake and cheesecake (not on the menu). Nice place to visit after an afternoon at the orchid garden nearby. Good service too. Helped the grandparents into their wheelchairs before leaving.
4
Nice brunch place nestled in the ginger garden of the botanical gardens. Nice interior decor in tropical settings Highly recommend the smashed avocado toast with tomatoes and goat cheese as well as the truffle scramble eggs on toast. Pair it with the lemongrass ginger tea!
4
Treat yourself to a culinary highlight break during your (must-do) visit of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Excellent food of above average quality.
5
great ambient, nice food. It is recommended to sit down before sunset in a sunny or cloudy days in the greeneries around.
4
Located in the midst of the verdant Singapore Botanical Gardens, Halia has a lovely location. Sitting in the interior part of the restaurant has the benefit of air conditioning - sitting outside allows you to be aware of the green space around you. We sat outside (I was hot but others in my party were ok with it).Our group included 3 kids and 6 adults. After a 25 minute wait, we got a table right by the bar - it was fun to watch the batman mix all kids of delicious (and colorful to boot) drinks. The kids ordered "Halia Breakfasts" which are served all day and include eggs, potatoes, sausage and more. My 12 year old son was very happy with his meal. The bruschetta appetizer was ok but not great. I had an avocado sandwich which was very good, while my wife had a prawn salad which she liked a lot. The pumpkin soup was apparently good too according to others in our party. Generally speaking, everyone enjoyed their food.The desserts looked amazing. Though I skipped dessert, my kids pronounced the "Die Die must have chocolate cake" absolutely delicious.Service throughout was excellent.All in all, a great experience.
5
Each dish we had (soup, spatchcock, salmon, kipfler potatoes and papaya salad) was delicious. The service was excellent, though perhaps the length of time the dishes took to come was a little too long for lunch. And of course the location, in the newly crowned UNESCO world heritage site Singapore Botanic gardens, could scarcely be better. Every bit as good as it was on our previous visit 13 years ago. Fantastic
2
Our Sunday Breakfast choice was Halia after hearing about it through friends and family. Whilst we enjoyed the surroundings and menu choice, we were shocked at the way we where billed following the breakfast. For someone like myself who has managed restaurants before, it seem's that some restaurants can really get this wrong, deterring future customers most definitely. While ordering, I asked for a few simple ingredients not to be included in the meal, due to allergies, and for an additional item to be added. The meal arrived and was kindly adjusted to my preferences, but without a condiment that later advised "Oh, sorry but we no longer have that, but still leave on the menu as it is only a small portion of the meal". When we finally got the cheque, we discovered that I was charged the full amount for my breakfast meal, and an additional charge for an added item. When the waitress was asked why, she returned telling me that the "chef would like to charge it that way". I understand meals have to be charged accordingly, but this is unfair and not encouraging for future customers. This type of billing is not fair, by any standards, and not in all my years of dining out and managing restaurants have I ever experienced such outrage towards a final cheque

We are often looking for unique restaurants in Singapore which are appropriate for small to medium sized groups attending leadership or professional development workshops.Since our workshop days are very long, it is important to find a restaurant which is fine tuned to providing an overall, exceptional experience for our workshop participants and their senior leadership team.Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens-Singapore is set in the beautiful surrounding of the Singapore Botanic Gardens and upon arrival, it feels as if we are entering a culinary spa.The service is exceptionally proactive, friendly and anticipate the interests of their guests, rather than waiting to be asked to be of service. The selection of wines by the glass is good and moderately priced for Singapore and the selection of appetizers, salads, main courses and desserts are truly unique.Our group felt as if we were honored guests of the culinary spa and I will be delighted to return again, because of the friendly and helpful service.Halia was appropriately renovated within the last 12 months, to be reflective of a culinary spa within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, so if you did not appreciate the former decor and ambiance, as I did not, please visit again and allow Halia to delight your culinary senses
4
Singapore's Botanic Garden was recently recognized as the first UNESCO World Heritage Garden in South East Asia and Halia is the perfect place to enjoy the atmospher and the food. You can enjoy indoor and outdoor seats and the food has plenty of choice to enjoy being in Singapore. Staff are very frinedly and makes the whole experience very pleasant. You should try Halia while you are in Singapore

We went here for lunch while on a visit to the Botanic Gardens. A member of the desk staff at our hotel had recommended it to my husband and as we seemed to arrive just outside it at lunchtime, we decided to give it a go. Halia has a fairly substantial menu, offering both light bites and heartier meals, a selection of puds which all sound wonderful from their descriptions and both hot and cold drinks and alcohol. We both opted for Singapore-style chilli crab with spaghettini, described as one of their specialities, and we were not disappointed as it was delicious and was a fair-sized helping too. I had a mocktail to drink, a Halia Mint Berry-ginger, mint, lime, blueberry and sprite as recommended by our waiter and it was lovely too. For pud, I had a concoction called The Ginger Garden, which looked absolutely exquisite and tasted rather good too!This was not the cheapest lunch we had at just under $S100 (¬£50) for two mains, one pud, a mocktail and two iced lattes but it felt like a classy lunch and was yummy too!The only issue we had was when it came to paying the bill. We waited and waited for our change and it didn't arrive. In Singapore, you are not necessarily expected to tip waiting staff and often, 10% service charge has already been added to your bill, as it had in this case. I have to say this was the only place in Singapore where this happened to us. Eventually, my husband asked for his change and you could tell they were surprised. You know, it was probably only about ¬£4, and if they'd returned it initially, my husband would have left it as a tip, as he had in every other restaurant we ate in, but on this occasion, because of their presumption, he didn't. Ah well, these things happen!
5
Consistently good service and menu, with a tropical paradise surroundings. Had lunch there with my husband and my parents, and all were very pleased with the meal and waiter. Still miss the cherry tomato salad they used to serve in a "kent" -- long serving tray for olives, but the variety of food remains quite healthy and inviting. Definitely a good place to take a break for a high-value if expensive meal in the Botanic Gardens

Ordered the signature Halia Breakfast and was very impressed. Air ventilation was good despite the 34celsius temperature. Good job ceiling fans! Good ambience, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the tourists. Will definitely visit again.

As we were walk in, Faisal managed to get a table to fit us comfortably. Love the coconut soup dessert and the ambience. Place is bit warm though.
4
The ambiance in this restaurant is perfect. I suggest for dinner at the end of visiting the gardens. If you like fries try their Rosemary, truffle oil French fries delicious!!!!!

Decided to stop here for a quick lunch and it was enjoyable! Had an appetizer and a salad and both were very tasty. Good service and nice atmosphere!
5
Simply FANTASTIC food. Not cheap - but good value for the really seriously good, 5 star restaurant quality food you'll have. My wife and I sat inside the air conditioned section, as it was a fairly steamy Singapore day and we had been walking through the gardens for a couple of hours and needed to cool down. The staff were very accommodating, Duan who greeted us and showed us to our table and Joy who explained the menu and waited on us throughout lunch. I had the Heirloom Tomato Salad with Fetta and gazpacho dressing, which was outstanding. Anne had the Tuna salad which was even more amazing. Small cubes of raw Tuna, marinated in Ginger and Lemongrass with a kind of wasabi tufts around the plate about the size of peas joined in a roadmap of funky mayonnaise stuff. I've eaten a lot of Tuna and this was up with the best.If you're in the Singapore Botanical Gardens, pop in - you'll be glad you did.

I've been to Halia for lunch a few times and always enjoyed it but dinner was a totally different experience. We were greeted by a lovely host who helped us choose the perfect table. Not too close or far away from the band. Our server Allen was very professional and extremely attentive. The atmosphere is beautiful, being surrounded by the gardens with the band playing was very romantic. We usually don't start our evenings so early but this was an exception. Arriving at 6:30 was perfect, we had a few cocktails and shared the crab dip to start, we followed it up with the yellow fin tuna and beef carpaccio entrees. For mains I had the vegetarian puffed pastry filled with pumpkin and my husband had their signature Chilli Crab pasta. Both were lovely. We finished off the evening with a cool drink while we listened to the band.I highly recommend visiting Halia on a Sunday evening and we will definitely be back
4
Came here for lunch with our friends who live in Singapore. Service was very good. Our host apologized that he could only squeeze our party of 5 on a square 4-seater table but when a table opened up before we ordered, he moved us to that larger table. I had the chili crab spaghettini which was very good but quite heavy for a hot and humid day for lunch, but I still enjoyed it. some of our other dishes were grilled salmon, tofu tempura, and a prawn salad which came with some noodles. All were very good. The highlight was the coconut soup for dessert. It was so refreshing and had such a nice coconut flavor with some candied ginger bits. It was not inexpensive but I thought it was worth going
5
This our fourth or fifth time to go to Singapore and I can't believe we only knew about this restaurant now. We really loved dining at Halia. It's located within a lush garden setting, with friendly and courteous staff (shoutout to one of our servers Dainiel who was very accommodating), and GREAT FOOD. We've dined at a number of michelin-star restaurants and could say that the food we had here--the chili crab spaghettini, salmon fillet drizzled with spiced pumpkin puree, dau miao, curry oil & sweet soy, and ginger nougat parfait--was truly comparable with the michelin-star dishes that we've tried. Flavors are unique, dynamic, and refreshing. Ingredients so fresh. For the quality and taste of the food and the beautiful ambience, it's not expensive at all. We will definitely come back. Strongly recommended for romantic dates or weekend meals with the family

We read about the reviews on Ladyironchef and were so excited to try it!We went on a cool morning after it rained. It was a beautiful setting. It was very packed though, lucky we made a reservation beforehand.There were many expats who came with their friends here. I could see the appeal It's alfresco dining and yet so calming with all the greenery around. The food was a little pricey but it was fantastic! I couldn't ask for more. The staff also knew the food well and could give us constructive recommendations which we enjoyed. The staff was very friendly too.I enjoyed my one on one birthday celebration here with my other half. A great experience
1
We went in for dinner and the service was extremely good and they called us by our last names. We ordered the halia herbalicious and the halia quencher sangria. Both of the drinks were very diluted and the taste was nothing great. Get better drinks in most places. The starters was goat cheese dish which was ok but expensive for a small portion. Main course was completely disappointing which we ordered a tofu tempura. For 28 dollars it was extremely expensive and low portion. Taste was below average as well. Nothing great about the dessert as well which was carrot cake with meringue and cheese ice cream. Will only recommend to go if you are planning to have a nice glass of wine and some starters before heading to a good dinner place later.
4
We had the set lunch today and the beef salad was very tasty and tender. The pork schnitzel was crispy tender and plentiful. Perfect setting with very attentive staff.
4
Many customers have already raved about the excellent quality of the food here so I won't do the same. Whenever I have visitors over from abroad I take them for a walk in Botanic Gardens. As this is best done in the morning when it is still relatively cool we usually finish at Halia for lunch. Compared to the other food options at the Botanical Gardens this is a luxurious one and not necessarily cheap. However the food is excellent and well-worth it. The added bonus is the beautiful location
5
We took a party of 30 to the Halia in the last week of May, and we had a great time. Having tested a few dishes earlier in the week, we devised our own menu, and Hetty (the sales exec) and her colleagues were really helpful with this. A lot of places would want you to stick to a set menu, so we appreciated their flexibility. The food was just lovely (highlights being the Paperbag oven-baked halibut fillet, Chilli crab spaghettini and for dessert - Strawberry Champagne and Textures of Chocolate). This has made me feel quite hungry now! :-) Anyway, I personally can't recommend this place enough, and thanks again to the team, including Sarah and Ryan
5
I brought my wife to Halia for our 4th wedding anniversary celebration. The place has a great ambiance and we were being served by Faizal and he is exceptional in explaining the menu as well as how it will fit into our taste bud. Faizal is extremely attentive as well, my wife was having a sorethroat and he came back with a small bottle of honey to go along with her warm water.Overall it is such a pleasant experience from the food, service and total overall setting. We left as happy customer and will definitely come back again. We will also recommend our friends to visit as wel
5
My favorite restaurant in Singapore thanks to the combination of food, location and ambiance. Cuisine is Asian fusion, Look for Jazz brunches. Avoid sitting across the path at Villa Halia. Ask for the main resaurant. Outdoor seating is pleasant all day thanks to plenty of shade and breeze
4
Halia used to be a little too formal but has had a re-think. The new more casual style is a great improvement. Cooking remains excellent & there are still some real gems on the menu. My only criticism would be that the menu is now more restricted with few choices for vegetarians. That said, the setting is quite wonderful, especially at night - a real trea
4
I stopped here during an afternoon at the Botanic Garden. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the array of savory treats and desserts were fantastic. There were five or six of each, and they were all delicious. Perfect for an afternoon break. I had the halia (ginger) tea, since we were in a ginger garden, and it was wonderful! Overall, it was a great place to rest after walking around the gardens. Tea was S$28 plus service charges, about S$34 total
5
Great & diverse menu with super friendly & positive staff. This is one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore, especially as we tend to combine it with a walk through the gardens. The ginger tea is a must & the meat platter is pretty damn good. Love the Jungle atmosphere feel & its even better if you can time your meal with the many rain showers we get out here in Singapore
5
It was one of the best dining experience i ever had, not only we arrived really late (about 925pm i think... last order had to be taken by 915pm) but Faizal went out of his way to ensure us that we will still be served with full dinner... Halia team @Botanic Gardens knows what great service/ hospitality really means! Food was GREAT! LOVELY ambience we will be back again!
5
This restaurant is very well integrated with the botanic garden.Decor - simple, elegant, warm, very comfortable. A great view of the garden.Food - A combination of European and Asian traditions, presented in a very natural way. Excellent taste and very healthy.Service - Perfect, delicate, smiling.Price - not expensive at all for the level of the experience.Atmosphere - A quiet, natural atmosphere in the middle of a very busy city
5
This is definitely one of Singapore's finest restaurants. Excellent food, amazing ambiance and great service/staff. Top notch all across the board!!!!
5
Longing for a salad after several days on the road, this restaurant made my day. Fresh ingredients, wonderful dressing, competent servers, beautiful space. One caveat: inspire of the heat outside, it is very cool in the restaurant. Come, eat, enjoy.
4
This restaurant is in between the beautiful ginger and orchid gardens at the Singapore Botanic Garden. The scenery was great--food, drinks and service was OK.
5
Ate here a couple of times,once for lunch with the set menu and the other for dinner,both times food and drink excellent.beautiful location,great staff.5stars
5
Came here with my boyfriend for a birthday meal. Straight away felt like we were on holiday - stunning atmosphere hidden among the jungle-like Botanic gardens. Great service, incredible house red wine. Recommend the chilli crab dip - delicious, and the Asian style carbonara linguine yum yum yum. Nice simple desserts, very fresh. Didn't feel too full at all. Can't believe I was in Singapore that night - felt like I was on a Thai island. Highly recommended, and a good price too
5
After a leisurely stroll through the orchid garden (itself one the the world's most beautiful places) I stopped for lunch at this beautiful restaurant. I was seated in their patio, surrounded by gorgeous trees and plants. I was quickly attended to by fine, professional servers. It was a typical day in Singapore, about 100F (38C) and sunny, so I was quite thirsty. Luckily, they have a fine selection of non-alcoholic refreshers. And the food was excellent. I left satisfied and refreshed. I have enjoyed the experience on two separate occasions while in Singapore, the more recent one being summer of 2014. If I am lucky enough to return, I will unquestionably seek them out again
5
Wonderful, friendly service. Beautiful location and one of the best puddings I've ever had - it was the nougat slice - gorgeous! I wish I could remember our waiters name, but nothing was too much for him... he was fab :) Me and my friends were very happy ...
5
We had never been to the Botanic Gardens and decided to spend some time enjoying the beautiful surrounds. We enjoyed the Chilli Crab special and a couple of glasses of wine, and it was an absolute delight! - If you have the time to linger - this is the place to do it. There is a small air-con section of the property, as well as covered outside porches and dining areas. We chose to dine outside - being from the UK it's always a novelty. A great few hours on our penultimate day in Singapore.When we return to Singapore we will return to The Halia
5
Best meal of our holiday! A lovely ambience overlooking the plants and a welcome rest from the heat. Cracking food, the chilli crab was bang on the money, but the deserts were top notch. My ginger garden was simply spectacular and Judith's chocolate concoction was much appreciated. Do not pass this place by
5
Halia at Bot garden is a wonderful,romantic place with attentive service and fantastic food.- LOVE the chilli crab spaghettini & their cocktails (Halia mint berry if I remember correctly)They also do high tea on weekends (we are talking scones etc in the jungle),be there early,around 3 pm as no reservations are taken for high tea.If you come by taxi best to go cluny road /parking space behind Halia and then walk to restaurant via the waterfall. outdoor reservations recommended,they have lovely fans to keep you cool.Toilets - only slight negative- please clean more ofte
5
Everything is perfect!!! Good job n services by Aizat n Dennis. Enjoy the food n tea. Wonderful experience
5
My husband thought this was one of the best meals he had ever had and the best during our visit to Singapore.
5
After a very long walk thru the Botanic Gardens we finally stopped to have lunch at Halia. The location is lovely, and the staff is very polite and prepared. Food is excellent, same as the refreshing drinks and cocktails.
5
+Pros:
-Views
-Food quality
-Good Service
-Decoration
- Cons:
-Short list menu
-Sometimes overbooking
4
Such a beautiful spot! My main course was a little forgettable but the mushroom soup was the best I've ever eaten. Good, unobtrusive service.
4
The Halia is in the ginger garden and offers an interesting ginger-themed menu. For a refreshing drink try the ginger and lemongrass. Lovely, well prepared dishes - very good indeed. The restaurtant is also a delightful place to sit and relax.
5
Had a mini brirthday dinner at halia earlier one. Loved the ambience loved the food and most importantly loved the pleasant hospitality given by the staff esp from bi fang and faizal. Continue with the good job! Will go there for food again. Thanks for the birthday card as well
4
The restaurant is located amidst nature and has a most relaxing ambience. The staff were delightful and decorated our dessert with birthday wishes as it was my birthday. Herbs, flower petals and spices are featured prominently in most of the dishes. The food was visually pleasing but more importantly, tasted delicious. My wife and I would definitely be back
4
My boyfriend took me to Halia for dinner last Friday and I have to say that the place is really lovely with very romantic atmosphere. We had reservation for outside seats, it's quite and you can enjoy the beautiful garden view. In addition, all the staff were really friendly and helpful. However the food was just okay, didn't really meet my expectation. We had the chili crap pasta, chili dip and the ginger dressing salad
3
We walked past and asked to reserve a table but were told first come first served basis, which was fine. We arrived back not long after midday and sat in the upper outside area overlooking the garden, which was a really pretty setting. It wasn't too hot either. We ordered the prawn satay salad and the singapore style chiili crab spaghettini. Both meals were tasty enough but the prawn salad left you wanting more as it wasn't very filling (only 3 prawns) - maybe they could offer a main size? We also had a couple of glasses of wine which was nice, but expensive of course. Our meals and 2 wines came to $95.00 incl tax which is quite an expensive lunch but in a pleasant setting. For some reason I had a high expectation of getting a wow factor with my meal but this didn't happen yet couldn't really fault what we had. Perhaps we have had better for the same price
4
We didn't eat much more than an ice cream between us, coffees mostly. It was just a lovely caf√© to sit in and watch the world go by. The lack of comment on food and service reflects this.
4
The setting of the restaurant amidst the Ginger Gardens is spectacular. Tucked away in a lush garden, sitting on the terrace, we had a wonderful time.
It really made our visit to the Botanical Gardens even more enjoyable!
3
The service is prompt and attentive. Ambience is amazing.Sever describe well about the foods on the menu. But chili crab pasta sauce is a bit dry, compare to Flutes.
4
Difficult to put our finger on what exactly didn't work here but we were underwhelmed - the food was 'nice' rather than 'excellent' and the service was 'ok' rather than 'outstanding'. Then venue was great though.
4
We stumbled upon this place for a bite to eat when in the Botanical Gardens. There was a wait for tables, do we had to reserve and come back in an hour. We then sat outside (rather than indoors in the air con) because that is where a table became available, but as it turns out, that would be my recommendation because the setting was really pretty and "tropical" but with fans, so not too hot. We only had a light snack - grilled prawn salad with a ginger dressing. The food was beautifully presented and very tasty, but the portions were not overly generous. It was not cripplingly expensive by UK standards, but compared to the food markets or chinatown in Singapore, it was pricey. Still, overall a nice experience and one I would recommend if you are in the Gardens - I just wouldn't go there as a separate, special trip
5
I went to the halia on my last night in Singapore! The food was amazing, a nice mix of asian and western influences! Surrounded by the botanic gardens I felt very relaxed and didnt want my meal to end! I would suggest getting the brushetta as a starter! Still dreaming about it now
4
We made a reservation at the Halia for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We had a party of 4, and went on a Sunday evening when they had live music. While the audio was a tad loud, it was a great added touch. We sat outside with a great view of the park.The food presentation is great, but food quality was only average. For the price, you're paying for the ambience and live music...not food quality.I was on the fence for service. On one hand, they knew that it was my gf's birthday based on email correspondence, and offered us a free dessert. In addition, they had the live singer perform "Happy Birthday", and even addressed it to my girlfriend! Nice touch.On the other hand, it was dreadfully slow. From having our order taken, the arrival of our food...all the way down to settling our bill. If you don't mind the wait, and want a parkside view, Halia is a great option. Just remember to go on a Sunday night when there's live music
3
Set right by the entrance to the ginger garden, this is a beautiful location. The food was pretty good especially the prawn satay and the crab spaghetti. Unfortunately they had run out of ginger beer! Sadly the experience of eating here was let down by appalling service. Maybe it was because they had to deal with a large group. We noticed that a table of at least 12 people got so fed up waiting that they left without eating. The waitress was very apologetic and deleted our service charge without prompting
4
Enjoyed a very good brunch here with friends. Beautifully located in the Botanic Gardens with lush green views. Ceiling fans make it very comfortable to sit outside. All of our main courses were very good and those that had pudding enjoyed it very much. Good coffee and tea selection including some different, house specials. Will go back for sure
1
After being told to come back for a complimentary meal on the house after our previous disappointing meal , i thought maybe we would give this place another go. we arrived for lunch after a strode in the beautiful garden. i explained that i was invited back but the staff seem quiet confused and insisted we take a sit and look at the menu then she will go and speak to the manager, we never saw her again. I think she was distracted by another group of customer. terrible service. So me and my girlfriend then ordered thru another waiter which seem more reliable. We ordered prawn satay for entr√É¬©e, chilli crab spaghetti, halibut fillet in a paper bag for main because we really enjoyed our fish the very first time we dined at halia before the renovation. Chilli crab spaghetti was nice. BUT both my prawn and fish are over cooked prawn a bit chewy. Seriously, if you can't get a simple fish right then you shouldn't be putting it on the menu. We left the restaurant hungry and not satisfied at all we ended up going for hawker chicken rice. Never coming back again. I don't recommend this place. Price set too high for what the chef can actually deliver
4
Came here after a terrible service experience at the nearby Casa Verde. To begin with, the service at Halia is great. And so is the food, although it's quite pricy and the (dessert) portions could be a bit bigger. But definitely worth a visit!

http://missneverfull.com/singapore-halia-botanic-gardens/
Omg the ambiance is soooo nice. We firstly ordered one plate of Chili Crab Spaghetti and several other dishes, the Spaghetti was so good and we added on another order!
5
Lucky to get table, advise too book. Nice wine, excellent beef rendang and nice atmosphere sitting in the garden. Can get tables inside with Aircon but preferred outside. Friendly attentive service.
5
We come here every time we are in Singapore for an elegant wine washed lunch after a long Botanic Gardens walk. Creative Asian fusion food that seems light and healthy.
4
We thought that perhaps it was a little overpriced for what it was exactly, but we did have a lovely meal. Food was delicious, staff were nice. Restaurant looked very pretty, atmosphere was right.
4
We brought our visiting parents to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens for a relaxing afternoon and had a wonderful break at Halia. The setting was perfect for the occasion and the service was pretty good. We did not have any food but the atmosphere and ambiance fits perfectly with the surroundings. We will be back with guests
5
Set in the midst of the Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, this restaurant offers a delectable spread of delicate dishes and scrumptious steaks. True to is name, Halia (Ginger in Mayay language) has a hint of fresh ginger in many of its dishes. This enhances the flavors and gives them their uniqueness. The mini cheese parcels I had as a starter tempted me to order some more but I moved onto the chickpea soup which was smooth on the palate and very delicately seasoned. My main was the pumpkin and barley risotto. The barley was cooked to perfection and the portion was perfect.Picking a dessert at Halia is a challenge in itself as each one seems more attractive than the other.The salted caramel chocolate tart is the Queen of them all.Make sure you have a meal at Halia when you visit the Botanic Gardens. Lunch or dinner the ambience is amazing
3
The setting for Halia is great, it is in the botanical gardens. However, i was disappointed. The vegetables including the potatoes were undercooked. It wasn't the style, it was that the potatoes were hard and crunchy, and not in a good way. The other people at the table, were not happy of their dishes. The staff were friendly, but too slow. The restaurant is not expensive, but the price is not correct
4
Located amidst the lush, tropical foliage of Singapore's Botanic Gardens, Halia is an excellent place for brunch. We love the restaurant's casual, family-friendly atmosphere. There's a wide selection of dishes on the brunch/lunch menu to meet everyone's needs. One of Halia's most well-known dish is its east-meets-west chilli crab pasta dish, which comes with generous chunks of crab in Singapore's famous chili crab sauce. We find the service at Halia exceptional. The staff are all very friendly and switched on. The restaurant seems very customer focused and takes feedback seriously.
4
Let me start by saying that the service at Halia is exceptional, Faizal and the girls were attentive, courteous and definitely on top of the list when it comes to service in Singapore. The location is beautiful, you really do forget where you are and I had to remind myself I wasn't at a tropical beach resort a few times. The food was lovely, the dessert in particular was the highlight. There's no doubt we will be returning
5
Very good service. They take the effort to remember your names and check if things are ok. Kudos to Mr Faizal for recommending a great wine to my chili crab pasta :)
5
Being back in Singapore after 4 year, the first thing we did was to visit Botanical Gardens and go for lunch at Halia. And they did not disappoint us. Great food, great service, and as always, a great ambience.
5
My mum and I went here after the orchid garden ,needing a rest . The food was lovely and service great. It was surrounded by beautiful gingers and heliconias. A nice refreshing place for a rest and great food
5
This was a cool oasis on a very hot day in the Botanic Gardens. Situated in the Ginger Garden it had a ginger theme with delicious signature tea drink, ginger dressings etc. Charming service and plenty of time to relax.
3
Reasonable and nice high tea set .
Not crowded and good ambience. Definitely best to visit after a long walk in garden
4
Have been at the halia restaurant and booked a table for dinner. First of all I have to state that it is an amazing location, in the middle of a "Jungle". So we have arrived at the venue and have been greeted very friendly from their host. The staff that is working there is really helpful and friendly as well as attentive. HOWEVER, we have ordered cheese pillows which are highly overpriced as well as 2 steaks which are ridiculously overpriced for what you get. The Sirloin Steak has been max 140g and has been sliced before and served to me (without being mentioned in the menu to be a precut) . The steak itself was for the price it had, just not what I would expect. I have been quite disappointed after the main and ordered the bill, and the supervisor has approached me and asked me immediately if I have not been happy with something. So i explained it to her and the follow up they have made on this issue was the only reason why I am giving this place a very good than a terrible. good job from the service team in this place. But kitchen (Please start to hire real chefs in there, it reflects on the food you serve to customers
1
Went for dinner with my girlfriend. It was our second visit. The restaurant setting has changed to casual decor which is a fantastic move. No white table covers which is nice. But the menu was DISAPPOINTING compare to the first time we dined there before renovation in 2014. We ordered two entr√©es and one of it was the Caesar salad with 62degrees egg but my egg was over cooked and was not runny at all! I ordered lamb rack with purple potato pur√©e for my main. My lamb rack is so dry and salty when I asked for medium rare. We are glad Ginger Garden dessert is still on the menu, although presentation is not as pretty as it was either but the taste still remained the same. Me and my girlfriend waited around to talk to a staff but they were too occupied to attend to us. I'm not sure what happened with the service and food quality now with the new renovation, new staff? new chef maybe? whatever it may be, we did not enjoy our second visit at all. ive been recommending friends after my first visit and now we don't think we will ever recommend this place to any of my friends visiting Singapore in the future. Not worth the money and time at all anymore
4
Had dinner at The Halia. The ambiance really sets you in a mood of being in tropical paradise. Dining in the middle of Botanic Gardens, away from the city noise really makes you forget about being in Singapore.Service was very good. Attentive waiters and waitresses. Love the interior. It has both indoor and outdoor dining area. I would highly recommend dining outdoors so that you can hear the sounds of crickets, leaves rustling at every breeze and occasional hoots of an owl. But if you can't stand mosquito bites, please bring a repellent or wear long dress/pants because I had few annoying bites but none of my friends who dined with me had that problem, thanks to their hairy legs/arms, long dress and long sleeves.Loved the chilli crab spaghettini. That's the most memorable food I've tasted there. My friends loved the bak kwa carbonara. Price was a little on higher end but it was worth it.Travelling to this place might be a problem. One has to take a taxi to Tyersall Avenue and alight at the entrance closest to The Halia. We made a mistake by alighting on Evan Road where the Visitor Centre is and we had to walked all the way there, but the view made up for the hassle.Recommended for couples seeking tropical mood in romantic meals
4
We enjoyed a full morning of touring the Singapore Botanic Gardens and stopped for lunch at Halia, near the Ginger Garden. This location lended itself well to ginger specialty dishes at the restaurant. Halia offers both indoor (air conditioned) and outdoor (covered deck with fans) seating - we waited 15 minutes for an indoor table. We enjoyed the iced Ginger Honey Infusion, a house specialty drink, and the Sangria - both refreshing and delicious. My husband and I shared the Chili Crab Spaghettini (spicy!) and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - thinly sliced beef flavored with Asian ingredients - a delightful twist on a long-standing favorite. Do not miss the Frozen Ginger Nougat Parfait with Spiced Pineapple Sauce, Ginger Crumble, and Crispy Crackers. It was one of the best desserts we've ever had! We look forward to returning to Halia for their Prix Fixe lunch special in the near future
4
After an enjoyable, but humid walk through the Botanical Gardens we felt like having a light lunch snack.This place was perfect.Indoor or outdoor dining is available. We cosy a crispy pita/ salad (s$14), and a garlic/ tomato bruschetta ($10).Well prepared, well presented foodAttentive service.Very enjoyable 
4
Lovely setting.
The food is excellent and the service very attentive.
Not the cheapest place to eat but very well presented.
A bit Nouvelle Cuisine so don't expect to come out feeling completely full!
5
This is where we had lunch when we were visiting the Botanical Garden. we had the vegetarian risotto , it was very tasty.
3
Located in the heart of the Botanic Gardens, near National Orchid Garden I decided is a nice place to have a good lunch. Wait to be seated sign was absolutelly a piece of furniture because after minutes of waiting nobody came to welcome us, so we went inside and found all by ourselves a table. Tried to obtain some recommendations because is a different kind of food in Singapore than that one we are used to in Europe, but was a little bit difficult to get, especially for a vegetarian and non spicy dish. The portions are a little bit smaller for the price. No wi-fi. Nice view for outdoor seeting. Filling in the customer satisfaction form, I was surprised to see the interest for the comments provided. I talked with an employee argumenting every issue filled in and I do appreciate the will of customer service improvement. The desert was on the house, a dessert wich I highly recommend: ginger icecream
5
Decided to stop and have a snack whilst visiting the beautiful botanical gardens and were surprised at what a gem this place was.We only had a light meal but the food was something you would expect from a hatted restaurant but at far less cost. The service was efficient and friendly.While the beverage prices were over the top (we were charged $22.00 ++ for green tea for 3) I would otherwise highly recommend Hali
4
While visiting the botanical garden it started raining quite hard, so we took cover in the restaurant. We had delicious tea and the waiter was absolutely wonderful. He gave us valuable information about the buses and Singapore and was super friendly. They also gave us ponchos to use in the rain. It was truly the friendliest service I received
4
We enjoyed a lovely lunch here after experiencing the glories of the beautiful orchid gardens at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (it is conveniently located adjacent to the entrance within the park). The service was first class, the menu stimulating and the atmosphere dynamic. We chose to sit inside to escape the humidity. The deserts were absolutely beautiful. Recommended
4
my girlfriend and I visited here for New Year's Eve dinner. It was the perfect place for a dinner for 2. Temperature outside was perfect and the garden lights are beautiful. All our food was brilliant and the service was spot on. Couldn't fault the whole experience.  
3
My family and I were here for dinner on New Years eve. We'd been to Halia at Raffles hotel earlier this year and were impressed with the food. This time however portions especially drinks( cocktails and cardamom tea)seemed smaller although I was reassured that the volume served was exactly the same as the other outlet. I ordered the chili crab spaghetti which was tasty and filing. My husband's paper wrapped halibut didn't taste as fresh as the one at Raffles. The soup was tasty. Price of $40 was on the high side. Ambience was nice & relaxing especially outdoors yesterday when the weather was cool and windy. Service was good and staff were very attentive
4
As it can happen in Singapore, we came into a rainstorm that lasted for about one hour while we visited the botanical garden. If this happens to you go there fast as many will seek shelter and enjoy a nice drink or some light food while looking outside into the green and simply enjoy the friendly atmosphere. The food is a bot overpriced and the drinks are as well but for not getting soaked fully worth the price.If it is included in your tour on a sunny day, better saty outside to see more of the garden
5
I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and chose the Halia at Botanical garden for our new year's eve dinner place. We arrived there around 6:30pm without reservation and luckly find one table available. Since this is the first time we visit the restaurant, I asked Faizal, who was in charge of our table, for recommendations. He suggested their signature pasta (singapore something, with crab meat), which was excellent, and the drink he suggested was also good. Specially recommend the bread, fresh and tasty. All the staffs are very friendly, attentive and helpful. Our special thanks go to Faizal, who not only provided excellent service, but also offered his personal mobile phone as a wireless hub to share the internet assess with us (the restaurant doesn't provide wireless service). Overall, great experience

Located just beside the ginger garden, Halia restaurant is the perfect restaurant for a lunch at Botanic gardens. Great ambience and good service
5
A hidden gem in the Botanical Garden. Staffs are very friendly and very helpful and good knowledge on their menu. Good ambient, and food is good too. Must try the Oven baked halibut fish.
5
Our first time at Halia and we learned that it has recently been renovated (along with the menu). The options are healthy, creative, and varied, with something for everyone.
We will definitely be back!

Halia in the botanic garden has been recommended highly, and I just experienced its great service.I went there alone to have ginger drink which I knew by the guidebook.The supervisor Mr. Dennis Castro took care of me from the time of escorting seat to of payment.His recommendation and nice talk( he knows some Japanese and Korean words) entertained me and made my break time memorable.I had wonderful time there.Such heartwarming services will satisfy you.I definitely visit again

An amazing venue: in the middle of the Singapore Botanical Gardens, outdoor seating...it requires a short walk from the entrance of the gardens but what a view! The menu was creative and interesting: very few of the usual suspects that you would find in a restaurant in town so it forces you to try something different, and it was worth the risk. The dishes were wonderfully done, using fresh ingredients from their gardens. Portions are good. Service was very friendly and welcoming. And most of all, perhaps due to the location, it was quiet so it was a treat to be away from the noise of the crowds that you would normally find in good restaurants in Singapore. Will very confidently go back again for sure

It is never easy to find a suitable place for a corporate event as our tea m has expanded to now be over 30 pax , so to get privacy and quality is difficult.This year we held our Staff Xmas event at Halia , where I had had a great personal experience at a Wine Dinner previously.I must send a huge thank you to the team as they exceeded my expectations.Starting with the bookings staff who were helpful and attentive (despite my busy schedule and delays in emails). Even the fact that I could bring my own wine (with corkage) was a major benefit.On arrival, I was warmly welcomed by Joshua , who quickly made me feel at home and informed about the evening. Everything was at or beyond my expectation and my last minute requests were handled without any fuss at all.The venue itself is well located, great d√©cor and spacious so perfect for our requirement of pre dinner drinks and sit down buffet.The food was just terrific , the choice on the original selection list was vast and what we selected was cooked perfectly. Flavoursome, visually appealing, tender and plentiful. Definitely amongst the best buffets (and I have had too many perhaps) that I have experienced.Fro m start to finish, we couldn't have been treated any better and everyone of my team was enthusiastic in the compliments of the venue and food.Well done Halia , you have set a high standard!Strongly recommend this to any one looking for an event of 30-60pax as you will no doubt have a terrific experience just like ours

Been to this place for dinner and Breakfast. Location: Had very romantic Anniversary dinner among the calm nature vibe.Food: One word - "Delicious"The staff are friendly but its take quite a time serving between each course. They carry nice selection of wine.Very kids friendly, i saw many kids enjoying the food and place

Inspired by my experience in Halia at Raffles Hotel, I treated by husband to a pre-Christmas dinner in Halia at the Botanic Garden. The menu was different from the Raffles but it was equally excellent. The setting which is in the middle of this lush garden made the experience even better. We would go there again. Best place to take visiting friends and family from abroad.
3
The staff are very friendly and efficient and as pleassnt as can be. However the kitchen really has a problem in timing. One main course after 15 mins then a second 10 mins later then two more some 45 mins after the first two main courses had been finished.! Very poor timings and many others were seen suffering the same fateWe wete offered a sweet to share .. sorry one and four forks is not acceptable and i had refused anywayThe food when arrives is good the restaurant vlean and the front staff very goodExpensive lunch for singapor
5
This restaurant is set in the spectacularly beautiful garden. The food combined the excellence of western cuisine with some local asian twist. If only the price is somewhat friendlier, I will probably go there every weekend.
5
The hotel is in the midst of the lush botanic gardens
The decor is elegant and stately and the food is delicious.
A must visit in Singapore, hope to be back soon.
5
Just had lunch here after touring the beautiful gardens,.had the signature dish of chilli crab linguini and I must say it was beautifully balanced,.the service was fantastic and friendly and the price considering the setting and given singapore is not cheap was very reasonable
5
Had a great evening, casual chic atmosphere. Fantastic food and Faizal was a knowledgeable, friendly, and super friendly getting us a cab in middle of the night and waiting with us to make sure we got into it safely.
5
This little restaurant tucked away in the Ginger Garden of the Botanical Gardens in Singapore is the perfect setting for a celebratory lunch or dinner. We like to celebrate Father or Mothers Day there with their brunch menu. The children enjoy the food there too, and it is family friendly- especially at lunchtime.You are a moments walk from the most astonishingly beautiful tropical gardens, so treat yourself to a meal at Halia's and then walk it off in the gardens
5
We've eaten at many restaurants in Europe and across the world, but the Halia in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore is in our experience a rare combination of excellent food and service in a beautiful exotic location. The Botanic Gardens make in themselves a wonderful precursor with acres of of exquisite orchids and the Halia set amongst the tropical 'Ginger Gardens' is an ideal setting for lunch. Halia is malay for ginger and that versatile spice is the general theme of the cuisine, often used in some unexpected ways. There is the choice of sitting on a verandah but we chose the beautifully cool and air-conditioned stylish interior. The choice and standard of courses is just right and the service is attentive, without being intrusive. We were so impressed that we returned to the Halia on our homeward journey from Sydney. It is not unduly expensive and in our opinion, a shining example of how things should be done. Don't visit Singapore without going to the wonderful Botanic gardens and the Halia
4
Spectacular setting in the middle of the Botanical Gardens. As mentioned in other reviews, the signature dish Chili Crab Linguine is one of the best Asian dishes I have ever had. My wife had the Shrimp which was tasty although not very filling. My only slight criticism was that there were long waits for service from beginning to end. Perhaps this is a choice to make the meal feel leisurely or, perhaps, I'm just another impatient American

This restaurant, which is nestled in the lush greenery of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, is a nice and unique place for weddings. My wife and I had our wedding lunch at Villa Halia in Oct this year, and we had a great time and received good feedback from our guests.We'd like to thank the exceptional staff at Halia for making our wedding such a smooth and memorable one; Mazni, our coordinator, had been absolutely professional and efficient from day one of planning, providing us with clear and concise information promptly whenever we requested for it.As the days passed and we got nearer to the event, we never panicked a single bit as every last minute change or request was met by Mazni with prompt solutions and dealt with in a calm assured manner. We could not have asked for a better coordinator.We also want to thank operations manager Fid for coordinating and providing excellent service on the day of the wedding. Everything went to plan and on time. He also listened to our feedback and dealt with it in a professional manner which we appreciate a lot.So thumbs up for the good service Halia and thank you

Set in the Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens you'd be hard pressed to find a more beautiful setting for a brunch or afternoon tea. The outdoor terrace seating offers the best views within touching distance of the nearby plants.They have a varied brunch menu but we both couldn't resist the Cinnamon French toast. A thick slab of soft bread, expertly flavoured and served with white chocolate and pistachios, wonderful. As you would expect from the setting many of the menu items and drinks have a ginger theme and the ginger tea went down a treat with the french toast.We returned later in the day for afternoon tea. Not your traditional English sandwiches and scones, but more like a mini exotic buffet, as has become standard throughout Singapore for afternoon tea service. The quality was again excellent although the variety of items could mean not everything will be to your taste.The staff were very friendly and helpful, even giving us free ponchos on leaving as a downpour had just started, a nice touch. My wife is vegetarian and they went out their way to modify the set afternoon tea service to suit.The Halia isn't the cheapest place to eat, but you get what you pay for, excellent service, a wonderful location and great food
5
The Halia is a lovely restaurant right in the heart of the Singapore Botanical Gardens. We were seated in the outside part with the warm breeze on us and thought it was a romantic setting. The food was delicious and we highly recommend the chilli crab spaghettini, ginger and black forest desserts, and yummy mocktails! The presentation of the desserts were just incredible. Our waiter, Zim, was extremely friendly and recommended some places to visit in Singapore as well. The overall price was reasonable too. One tip - make sure your taxi driver takes you the correct way (check for directions on the restaurant website) as we were dropped off at the front gates and it took us quite a while to trek through the gardens in the dark to reach our destination
4
a romantic location coupled with superb food specially the rack of lamb and chili crab spaghettini! staff was courteous and knowledgeable about the menu. overall it was a very good experience.
5
Great ambience, delicious dishes, supeeerrrr friendly staff ! I would more than love to come back :)
5
Service was excellent, food was delicious and the ambience was very peaceful. You can take a stroll before or after meals in the surrounding with the trees, pond and cool air.
4
There are two parts to this establishment - the Halia and the Villa Halia. The latter is exclusively for events/parties. It's located on the western edge of the botanical gardens, the "green lung" of Singapore.This place came recommended as "different" ...But I have to say that the food was very good, as was the service and ambience. There was even a live band playing jazz.Overall an excellent experience and most definitely a place I'd go back to again
4
I love the ambiance and surrounding of the botanic gardens of Halia. The food is fine and great for interesting mix of ingredients. However that comes with a price. It is not exactly value for money if it is what you are looking for.However if you want a walk in the park after dinner or just have a romantic meals, it's the best place to go to bring your date for a good night.I must say the food is good though. And maybe for people who like portions that are not too big or overeat, you may find this an ideal place... you are paying for the ambiance, so depends on what you want.It's an occasional treat
4
In a tourist attraction such as the botanical gardens you would expect low quality food and poor service. Well none of that here. The staff was very attentive and the food was nicely done (portions big enough but not too big and beuatifully presented).Seating outside in the patio is the best, and actualy gets even more cozy when it rains.Both me and my husband had the chili crab spaghetti, it's worth the try
2
My husband and I fell in love with the Singapore Botanic Gardens on our recent trip to Singapore. It is an amazing oasis in the concrete jungle of Singapore. When we heard that there was an upscale restaurant in the gardens we were ecstatic. We quickly made a reservation. Unfortunately, the experience was a total disappointment. The location was wonderful but the service and food were mediocre at best. Certainly not worth the very elevated prices. And to make matters worse, there was a constant beat of techno-pop "music" in the background. We wanted a delicious meal served in a natural garden of Eden and we got an average meal served with the background noise of a mall
5
Honestly I never knew this place existed. Trawling the net for a romantic dinner place for our wedding anniversary, I got this popped up in the search.I got to say, it was a real romantic dinner for both of us. My other half enjoyed the ambience and mood with the indoor dining surrounded with flora and fauna on the exterior. Moreover it was drizzling lightly which gave that cosy and cold setting.The food was just awesome. Non traditional stuff, more like of western and mixed with Asian Fusion. I really enjoyed by Seafood Satay Glaze with a glass of white wine. Their wine selections are real classy too.In an overall note, it's just an awesome dinner place for 2. Settling in for some great food and drinks. You can pop in with a group of friends but I won't as the mood of this place just isn't for a group dining
5
It is very near the Orchid Gardens & was a great spot for lunch. The staff were all very friendly & helpful. We sat on the outside terrace & really enjoyed being there. The food was excellent, I had the chilli crab spaghetti, was so good much better than I expected & I would highly recommend
4
By chance, I visited Halia while at the Botanic Gardens with my friend and his family. It was very hot and humid out so we opted to eat lunch indoors where the air conditioning made it very pleasant and not too cold.Service was very good, they accommodated the toddler in our group with a kids meal quickly to avoid a melt down, while the adults took a bit more time to peruse the various choices on the menu.I opted for the french toast with white chocolate and berries which was extremely tasty and well cooked, crisp outside and light and fluffy inside. The other meals also looked very appetizing of duck and crab linguine.This is definitely a great place to eat if you are already in the Botanic Gardens, however, not somewhere I would make a special trip for
4
The service here was excellent and the food was delicious, slightly expensive but worth every cent. Great!
4
Love the experience of dinning in the garden. The food was good and the service excellent. The staff there was knowledgeable, very courteous and attentive.
5
We had just left the Orchid Garden and walked past Halia and decided to stop for a rest and a snack. It looks quite plain although cool and comfortable and we didn't have great expectations for the food. We both had tomato and basil soup with bread followed by different salads and it was all fantastic. I've never had such intensely tomato-flavoured soup - it tasted like sun-warmed, freshly picked tomatoes! Our salads were equally fresh and delicious. The service was pleasant and knowledgeable. We were sorry we were only there for a snack. Next time we'll go back for lunch or dinner and sample more of the menu
5
I was surprised they were fully booked but still find a way to accommodate me on the terrace for an early dinner. Perfect spot in the garden greenery, nice and relaxing ambiance. I love ginger and they had great options in the menu for my taste. Both food and drinks were great
5
My family and friend were visiting the Orchid Garden within the Botanical Gardens and decided to stop at Halia (Malay for "ginger") for lunch. Not wanting to walk very far, we checked out Halia and thought it looked interesting. I'm so glad we did.Upon entering, we were greeted with a neutral, "Asian-y" decore in an uncramped seating area (we sat inside). Having a look around, there is also a very large outdoor dining area that also carried over this vibe.I had the restaurant's signature dish: Chili Crab Spaghettini with a fresh fruit juice mocktail. My wife had a Duck rillette with pan seared peach, and my friend had the Cinnamon French toast with fresh berries. Everything about the food was top notch: presentation, flavours, and portions (not too big, not too small). Even my daughter's spaghetti with tomato sauce was nice, which usually can't be said for a kids meal.Service was also very good and accomodating to a group with a 3 year old. They provided us with special kid utensils, cups, etc. for our daughter, which was really appreciated.Overall, Halia deserves it's 5 out of 5 because it is so unexpected. Typically when visiting tourist our group attractions, the food is typically pretty bad: fries, chicken nuggets, etc. The very fact that Halia exists and cooks excellent food just didn't compute with my expectations.But don't take my word for it - try it yourself
5
Enjoyed a weekend lunch after a morning of taking in the botanical gardens. The air conditioning was a welcome break from the humidity, as was the delicious food and hospitable service. I tried what the waitress described as the house specialty - chilli crab over spaghettini. It was an incredible mix of sweet and spicy, with plentiful amounts of crab meat. Being in the Ginger Garden, I had to try the iced dried ginger and honey drink, and it both refreshed and paired nicely with the spicy dish.
5
Sausage nibbles platter was wonderful and plentiful with eggplant dip and red plum chutney. Singapore-style chilli crab spaghettini had crab throughout with a wonderful spicy sauce that didn't overpower the crab. Great wine selections and cocktails. Waitress attentive and meal paced well. View over ginger garden in a light drizzle was gorgeous and soothing. Fun walk to the restaurant through the Botanical Gardens
3
The location is beautiful, can't beat the botanic gardens.The setting is a bit too simple for the price range. but still very nice. The food is a great effort at creativity but fails to deliver on taste. We had the house cured salmon and cheese pockets as starters: The Salmon was ok, but sitting on a completely bland salad with bits of beats and cucumber on a bed of bread crumbs. Unseasoned and mostly flavourless, looks pretty but a total miss. It comes with a 'wasabi ice cream' that is actually a very sweet vanilla ice cream that is an absolutely terrible mix of flavours. The cheese pockets are just that. Nothing else on the plate, juste a pile of fried little pockets of cheese. No texture or outstanding flavour.The main: We opted for the meat special a 550gm Wagyu steak with a 8/10 marbling at 170$ ++. The meat and side were very good. However, the meat was lukewarm, and definitely not a 8/10 wagyu. (More chunks of fat than marbling). The sides were good: Roast potatoes with Sunchoke and a tomato salad.Service is great and my pregnant wife's special needs were catered for.Total bill 350$ for 2
5
The food is a bit pricy however; the service they provide is very good. The staff that served us was very friendly. He recommended the drinks and the food. The atmosphere is very nice. It was not crowded and it was quiet. We definitely will come back here again

To Riduan, Mazni, and everyone in Team Halia,From our very first meeting with Riduan all the way to when we collected the leftover decorations from Andy the day after, every single interaction we‚Äôve had with Halia was absolutely brilliant and top-notch. We cannot emphasise enough the professionalism, promptness, and proactive attitude of everyone that undoubtedly helped make our evening extra special. From our conversations with our guests that evening and after, they were definitely impressed with the beautiful venue and warm service, as were we. In particular, we would like to thank: THE CHEFWithout exception, the first thing everyone raved about was the food. The reviews online hardly do justice to the quality and taste that was on offer that evening. Of special mentions were the Chilli Crab Spaghettini and Beef Rendang. RIDUANYour effusive personality and charm were so irresistible, you convinced us to commit having our wedding dinner at a place we hadn‚Äôt even seen in person yet. But it was your professionalism and helpfulness that cemented our belief that we made the right choice. MAZNIWe had to deal with so many details in the lead up to our dinner, but if there‚Äôs one thing we can honestly say we were absolutely not worried about, it was the planning on your end. From replying to our emails so quickly (even at odd hours) to understanding what we needed even when we did not, you handled everything with grace, efficiency, and a big smile. Even though you were not there that evening, your briefing to the team was so detailed, it felt as if you were. ANDY & JOSHUAYour experience and organisational skills are surpassed only by your friendliness and warmth. Our sincere thanks to the both of you for making our evening run without a hitch and helping with everything we needed, both big and small.We‚Äôd especially like to thank the both of you with regard to the lights issue ‚Äì Joshua for escorting a bride struggling with her gown and high heels out in the dark for her cigarette and following up immediately with NParks, and Andy for giving his torchlight to a guest. TEAM HALIAOur apologies for not getting all your names, but our evening would not have gone the way it did without your hard work. It is definitely a case of first-class service from first-class people. Thank you once again, one and all, for the marvellous jobs and for making our evening so special. Weddings are always memorable for many reasons, and we‚Äôll always look back at ours fondly thanks to Halia and its staff.Yours sincerely,Ian & Andre

had lunch at Halia, they were extremely busy, we waited for over 45 min. how ever we were given a small ice cream!!!! for thanking us!
the meal was very nice, when it did come.
will go there again, love the botanic garden.
4
We stopped here for breakfast when we were visiting the gardens.it was lovely, the food was great, the service was great and I would recommend trying the ginger infusion drink-absolutely lovely!!
5
Had dinner here and had an enjoyable evening celebrating birthday for a gal friend. The restaurant is open-air and surrounded by greenery with lovely lighting giving it a very romantic atmosphere.The staff were all very friendly,attentive and efficient and the food was pretty good. Good choice to celebrate any special occasion with your love ones if you are not really too focus on the food
5
We had dinner here and had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. There is a bar for pre-dinner drinks. The restaurant is open-air and surrounded by greenery with lovely lighting giving it a very romantic atmosphere.The staff were all very friendly and efficient and the food was very good. The restaurant has an all day menu so there is a wide variety of dishes to chose from. Portion sizes are generous. The gardens are lit at night so it is possible to go for a stroll after dining.A few words of advice:1. Make sure you book as it seems to get very busy in an evening2. It would be worth using insect repellant as you will be eating outside3.Ask the restaurant to call you a cab as it could be difficult to find one from this location
4
Be on time, as it does get busy. This was a Friday, and we arrived just a little before 12noon, just before opening time, and started with some iced water and refreshing lime juices.Ordered about 10past and had lunch delivered at 12.30pm. Lunch is cooked fresh, so you may have a bit of a wait depending on your dish.Unknowingly we both ordered the "signature" dishes - chili crab spaghetti and the satay skewered prawns - absolutely delicious, subtle flavours, just right for a light lunch. Reasonably priced, and as all in Singapore, you do *pay* for a glass of wine... but have to say that the wine match suggestion for my prawns was perfect.Attentive staff, breezy setting (chose the upper balcony) made for a welcome finish to our 3 hour explore morning in the gorgeous Botanic Gardens
4
This place is pretty close to my house. Great venue with a very nice atmosphere. Service is a bit patchy, but that seems to be the new normal in Singapore after the visa regulations changed. Food is ok but far from all the raving reviews that put Halia in the top 50. For brunch you can get a good bottomless coffee/tea option. Solid place, will always go back
4
Hidden amidst lush greenery, this great place if perfect for all occasions. I took the MRT and stopped at the botanical garden stop. Had to walk quite a distance to reach here. Well it was a nice walk in the nature. If you are not keen you can take a cab to the entrance. Make a reservation ahead to get a good sitting. Smokers this place is strictly no smoking as the botanicals is a no smoking area. Wide variety of selection of food which is carefully prepared to tickle your taste buds. They have great cocktails but on the higher side of the budget. Food was tasty and reasonably priced in my opinion. A great view of the garden with a band playing jazz and blues sets up the romantic ambience. If you make a trip to Singapore, do try this awesome restauran
3
If you're going for ambiance, this is the place. But if you're going for food, I'd say take a pass. The price was comparable to places with better food like Pollen or Gattopardo but the taste was no where near. I've had better japanese rice and seafood at Sakae Sushi for half the price. Wine and cocktail selections were good but I wouldn't return. :
5
We had a great meal here with helpful and attentive staff. As it was our anniversary the setting was quite romantic and comfortable. For a special occasion it is a lovely restaurant. Tip-if coming by taxi make sure they know which entrance to come into the gardens. Our driver didn't so we had a long walk. The staff arranged a taxi when we left which was great.
5
premise - with the company of trees and insects at night, this resto is set to wow patrons. With some live band playing cool Jazzy music, it's hard not to like this place. book early, if you are a walk-in, make sure it's after regular meal times.location - Botanic Gardens, come early and get some coupon parking spaces. Park at own risk illegally as there are LTA enforcers patrolling here often. Else, park at the main car park of the gardens and walk about 10mins to the resto.staff - all friendly and polite. I felt like a million dollars and the attention given was above and beyond. Even other establishments that pride themselves in 5-star service may have lost out to the good people of Halia. the servers here do not see colour as a passport to good service, they treat you nice regardless. :)crowd - good mix of people. from couples to friends to big family groups.food - wow... i was impressed. loved all the dishes that we ordered except the dessert, that was 4/5 to me but the starters, small bites and main (Rendang was 4.5/5)were like dancing in my tongueverdict - MUST GO. for locals, you have to go, it's not expensive as it used to be and for tourists, since you will likely be in Botanic Gardens, do drop by and enjoy the hospitality of the people in Halia and enjoy the evening in the holistic settings of the gardens, because, after all, how often do you get to eat in such tranquil settings in your own country? :
5
The setting was beautiful ,squirrels running around!
Party of 4, 2 of us had the Caesar Salad with fresh bread ,olive oil for dipping, YUM! the other 2 had Satay prawns, WOW, huge prawns, and the sauce was great!!!! very reasonable priced, would recommend
5
Great Place located the ingwer garden of the botanical garden, we found the restau just by accident and are absolutely convinced: this is a place to be!!! Outstanding food, great atmosphere and top class service - we are coming back!
4
The setting is great, amidst the diversity of greenery with interesting shapes and colours of flowers. Menu is good enough, I'm there for the ambience and the good company of friends. Rather relaxing.
4
To celebrate my birthday, we had brunch at Halia. Menu is good although they ran out of bacon for their breakfast set. My daughter loved the chicken nuggets. I loved their signature Chili Crab Spaghettini. Service was great. Great ambiance.
5
They don't have so many dishes but everything is astonishing, tasty. The stuff is very friendly, helpfull and try to guess your desire. Foods and drinks were more than we expected: very tasty, smells heavenly. If you want to eat something really good with friendly people definitely go there
4
Visited the gardens last August. The gardens were beautiful but we had been on our feet all morning and were tired and hungry. We saw The Halia and thought how cute it was but were so surprised that the food was good too. We had nice food drink and a rest. No complaints
4
After a delightful morning wandering through the Orchid gardens we were in dire need of a drink and some food. Usually the restaurants in these settings are mediocre, but not the Halia. We had a terrific experience: delicious food (especially the salad with prawns and mangoes), chilled drinks, and a fan overhead. We especially liked that the children's menu attracted many young families and we enjoyed watching how well they were treated and how much the children enjoyed their food. Highly recommend it!Tip - try to arrive just prior to noon if you don't wish to wait
5
Set in a lush green garden, Halia boasts one of the best weekend brunch menus and my all time favourite is the poached egg on brioche with sauteed spinach and mushrooms. The golden yolk once burst just oozes with sunshine happiness for me and the brioche soaks every bit of the golden yolk right up

New to Singapore, mid 2013. Living near Singapore's Botanic Gardens, we delighted in exploring all SBG had to offer. We had stayed at Raffles Hotel while waiting for our furniture shipment to arrive so were familiar with Halia, but did not eat there. Discovering Halia at SBG, we felt we were in for something special. September 2013: First impressions did not disappoint. Host welcoming and seating outside provided a very relaxing ambience. Service was good but somewhat distracted or stressed. Food was delicious as we laughed somewhat nervously about this meal being the most expensive breakfast/brunch we had ever eaten, which was quite a feat in itself!Fast-forward to Christmas 2013. Given our brunch experience and a newspaper article highlighting the best places to celebrate Christmas lunch, we promptly booked and were excited about the prospect. The cost was surprisingly reasonable but we did not reflect upon how that might affect the quality of the experience.We were very disappointed with our Christmas lunch on every level. Firstly we were seated inside, in an awkward concrete enclosure that was completely disconnected from the main restaurant area. It completely lacked any festive atmosphere and felt like an outdoor pavilion shooting above its weight.The food was set out in buffet style and as is often the case with buffets, looked mass-produced and messy. Service was haphazard and our drinks order was forgotten. Again, table service portrayed a sense of stress. We felt like we were shoved in the corner and forgotten. There was no festive spirit in this experience whatsoever. We were very sad as it was our first Christmas in Singapore, away from family in Australia. We had thought this experience would be delightful. We would have been happy to pay more (given how expensive our brunch had been) to celebrate Christmas in a style that befitted the occasion.We hope to find somewhere wonderful and inclusive this Christmas 2014. It will not be SBG Halia
5
We had our wedding dinner there. The food was as delicious as ever and the service was impeccable.We have also visited the place several times before and it is one of the few (less than five!) places in Singapore, where the waiters really deserve a generous tip for their service.I can't commend enough the place
5
They have been named one of Asias best restaurants, and I would say they deserve that. Apparently they have recently dropped the price level and serve simpler foods, but it was clear from our visit that the staff (Both serving and kitchen) are still at the top of their game. We went with a toddler in a stroller but were welcomed with open arms.The wine pairing was superb, and it would not have been shameful to serve the food in a 1-star restaurant
4
I always like restaurants which provide a good view. So when TA threw this as no 1, I had to check it out. Especially when the view is so Non Singaporean to say. You cannot see anything concrete when you dine here. Instead, all you se is greenery, foliage, plants, flowers... It's just divine. The ambience is basic but that's what makes it special. Service is good.They don't have much choice for vegetarians so we ended up ordering all that they and for us: Risotto and a Pasta. Both were very good in taste. Our server even suggested a nice wine that would compliment the same.I have been told that they have excellent duck and chicken.Go here for an evening where you can relish the fabulousness of Botanical Gardens at a much quieter time.Don't go if you are a veggie.

During our visit to the Orchid Gardens at Singapore Botanic Gardens we were fortunate to find the Halia Restaurant adjacent to the Orchid Garden. The service and meal were excellent, the staff had product knowledge of both beverages and food , our selection of Pork Hock salad with a white wine was as good as could be wished for. Peter B

Visited this weekend. Booked Patio seating in advance. We were greeted by exceptional service with a smile which is rarity in Singapore. Great ambience and wonderful location inside the botanical garden. We ordered Wagyu Beef and Crab Spaghetti, I must say that food must have been cooked before hand because it arrived very quick and was also not warm enough. Similarly in 3 minutes of ordering our desserts they arrived too . All in all average food. Don't miss the opportunity to go for a romantic walk after the dinner in the botanical garden which will make up for any shortcomings in taste.

Explored the famous Botanical Gardens again this weekend and made my first stop at Halia despite living in Singapore for a few years. The salad I had for lunch was good, but not remarkable -- but a very nice break before entering the National Orchid Gardens. What did strike my fancy was the array of gourmet desserts, which is why I had the salad for lunch. It was a tough choice, but I went for the Banana Bread with Coconut Ice Cream and Honey-Glazed Macadamia Nuts with Hot Butterscotch Sauce. Even the banana slices were burnt sugar crusted. Awesome, try it! The bread is a dessert nut bread with the bananas and other goodies on top. Can't wait to go back and try the other desserts and perhaps Afternoon High Tea

Singapore Botanical Gardens are exceptional. And in its Ginger Garden, there is a small, upmarket restaurant called Halia, whose signature dishes and cocktails are all done with fresh ginger, in subtle dosage.We discovered it on 7 June, a greyish, rainy day and had delicious chili crab Spaghetoni, with prawn satay as starters. We came back on 18 June, stopover day on our return to Europe - sunny and bright, we enjoyed the gardens (on a hot day try the rainforest trail to get cool) and ended up having the hokkaido scallops and Wagyu Beef Rendang.Try a ginger infused Cosmopolitan as an ap√É¬©ro - you will never want your cocktail without ginger again

This restaurant is one of the restaurants that i absolutely love. I first came down here for a Meet and i have to say, I love the ambiance. Its quiet and peaceful and it is a change of environment for someone who is looking to escape from the fast paced environment outside.another plus point is that it is located in the beautiful Botanic Gardens.You can take a walk along and reach the Halia just in time to have their signature Halia's ( Ginger in Malay) drinks!Their Signature dish Chilli Crab Pasta. it is one of my favorite dishes in the restaurant and if you do go by, this is a must try. From the Manager to the staff , every single one of them was professional and friendly at the same time.you do not have to trust my word.. you can go down and experience this yourselves. Great place for couple

Having spent the morning wandering around the stunning Singapore Botanical Gardens we were thirsty and hungry so when we came upon this little restaurant tucked away in the Ginger Garden we dived on it, thinking a coffee and snack would keep us going. Little did we realise we would experience such fine dining. Our little snack was the best chilli crab pasta ever invented, along with the entree of prawn and mango salad. The ginger based dressing on this salad was tastiest I have ever had.The service was impeccable and friendly. And the 'coffee' ended up being the best Singapore Slings in town. It changed our day! Will be going back

This is the 10th restaurant I've visited while in Singapore. It was not as easy to find specially if the taxi driver do not know where to go, with good assistance from their staff we managed. Was late for our reservation for 30mins though. We were warmly welcomed by the hostess, however we can't get a table in their alfresco, perhaps its Friday and they looked busy. Here are my comments*Prawn Satay for appetisers-somewhat Asian yet modern in presentation. Loved the mango combination.* Lamb Rack-too sweet for me but my wife loved it. It was done perfectly, though they could be more generous with vegetables portion* Stingray-not a fan of this dish for curry was over powering, must replace dish for me.*Devil pies -very good desert to share. It was chocolatey yet not overly sweet,not to mention me being not a fan of sweets. My wife was satisfied with their service and she's not easy to please. They introduced the food and call you by name is a plus points to us.To end the good meal we were called a cabby and they did not stop until they got one. Since we got lost we were sent to the taxi by the hostess,too bad Im not good with names.Jeg vil vaere tilbake

A very nice place to have our final dinner out in Singapore before heading home. The botanic garden is a wonderful setting, especially after dark when the scents of the plants take over from the view. Food was faultless with a well-thought out menu.Downside? Well, I'm not used to having to argue with the waitress when my choice of dishes doesn't coincide with what she thinks I ought to have. Maybe we didn't start off on the right foot when we said we wished to sit inside and she said the terrace was better, but really, when it came to main courses "Why are you not going for the beef as I suggested?" shouldn't be a key part of restaurant's dialogue with its customers. Given the heat in Singapore it's very tiring having to cope with strident staff when all you want to do is sit down and enjoy a good meal at the end of the day.That aside I'd certainly go back. We did have an enjoyable evening overall

Good food with personalized service, very pleasant location for a meal of two. Serve nice Riesling wine from Germany and both Angus and Wayu beef on the menu.

we celebrated my wife's birthday at Halia. we had seen it many times during our walks at the botanic garden and always wanted to visit.It was a mixed evening. I had requested a small cake for wife' birthday and the restaurant had called ahead to make necessary arrangements. They brought out the cake and played the surprise part very well (Thank you). The service was attentive and friendly but they could focus on the details (our olive oil was served but they missed serving the bread until we asked). The outdoor ambiance was very nice.On the negative, there are no directions on the website about parking and we ended up parking very far (long walk). The food was average (for a restaurant of this nature actually below par). We had the scallops which were presented well but there was no taste in the dish. The lamb was overcooked (I had ordered medium-rare, it was more like medium - well done and was not juicy but tough) and the accompanying vegetables & puree were tasteless. The Duck Confit was only slightly better.While other things are important in a restaurant dinner, food is major factor and it disappointed

A visit to this restaurant late last year surprised my husband and I having never heard of it on our prior visits to Singapore. The food was fantastic, the service spot on and the ambiance was unique and beautiful. Fast forward half a year, and I don't know what on earth has happened, the restaurant seems to of been fairly poorly overhauled. Change of ownership perhaps? Service wasn't to the professional standard that we had experienced prior. Though the food was still very good, the beef wellington was amazing, far better than great examples I've had at The Hand and The Flower and Claridges
4
When we arrived we were greeted by name (we had made a booking) and the service was amazing all night. At first, I wasn't too excited about the menu, but once I had found something I wanted to eat, I was delighted with my choice of duck. It was delicious and tender. My husband's lamb was equally delicious. It's not cheap there, and the menu is not particularly extensive, but the food and service were impeccable
3
The original Halia was undergoing renovations and the restaurant was temporarily located in a different building just across the original building. We had the chili crab spaghettini which was just okay and a bit overpriced for the quantity and the quality. The same can be stated about most of the restaurants in Singapore if you are used to the portions in the USA! The honey-infused ginger drink is quite strong with a very spicy after taste. If you do not like ginger, you will not like the drink. The customer service was okay, we had to flag down the waiter to get additional bread
5
We got caught in a big thunderstorm whilst visiting the botanical gardens and dashed into here to wait for it to pass. Ended up being the best meal of our entire holiday in Singapore and Malaysia. Each dish was meticulously explained and tasted superb. Fresh local ingredients within each one.The cocktails were also delicious, I had a Singapore Sling and my partner had a Halia one. I thoroughly recommend this place, very romantic and special

Wow! My husband and I still haven't got over the amazing dining experience that we were treated to at this restaurant while celebrating my birthday! We initially planned to dine at the Raffles Halia, but due to the venue being fully booked we were instead referred to the SBG venue. And what a great stroke of luck this was! On arrival we were immediately made to feel welcome, and were treated with the utmost hospitality professionalism. Staff were friendly, accommodating, and paid attention to the smallest detail. The cuisine was delicious, and we thoroughly enjoyed each stunning course! The restaurant had a lovely ambience, and we appreciated being seated by an open window to enjoy the surrounding nature. Based on our experience, we highly recommend Halia at SBG. Special mention to Mr R. Allan for one of the most memorable dining experiences that we have ever had, and for making my 30th birthday dinner an event to remember
5
We stopped here for something to eat while walking around the Botanic Gardens. The staff were very friendly and accommodating with the table they gave us as we had a large pushchair. The menu has a good choice of food. I had beef carpaccio to start with followed by chicken breast, dauphinoise potatoes and sprouts. My sister had the tomato salad to start followed by the crab linguini. The food was beautifully presented and reasonably priced. We would go back ;-
5
We ducked into this restaurant due to a rainstorm and boy, were we glad we did! I had one of the best breakfasts ever .... cinnamon french toast with fresh fruit, white chocolate and pistachios. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious! It's a lovely spot with white tablecloths and a feature-wall waterfall. Be sure to stop in for a respite from walking around the garden
4
It was on my birthday during the Sept month and my galfriend has made a dinner arrangement. I am impressed with the service render throughout our dining experience. From the moment i step in till i leave the restaurant, they actually great me by my surname. I was impressed with courtesy service by the restaurant staff with so much smiles on their faces even tho i knew they are actually physically tired
3
if you are admiring the botanical garden then halia is a great spot for a lunch or sunday brunch. Food is ok, not spectacular, prices are good the location is great
2
I walked to my own table as there was no host available to show me to mine. My steak burger was overdone which was a real shame as it possibly could have been good. The dessert was average. When it was time to leave the host had re-emerged and not so much as a smile as I left. They seemed a bit flurried that day though I was given to believe that bus loads of tourists sometimes descend upon that restaurant I guess they did not have enough service staff trained in time. Would I go back, no. Why? This was a real splurge for me so this was a bit of a 'let it go' moment. p/s can't be sure of the date of my visit...mid 2013 I guess
4
We had planned our visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens a few weeks in advance of our arrival in Singapore. We reserved a table in advance for lunch, although in retrospect, on a weekday Thursday, that was probably not required. For anyone visiting the gardens for a day, Halia makes for an obvious place to enjoy lunch.The vegetation around the restaurant is so lush that is quite easy to miss the building. The hostess and servers are friendly and accommodating. The restaurant offers both outdoor and airconditioned indoor seating (we opted for outdoors). After a morning of walking in the sunny gardens, we were, unfortunately, more thirsty than hungry, so we ate sparingly, one appetizer and one entree between the two of us. Both appetizer and enree were good, however, including a nicer-than-necessary presentation for a midweek lunch.In fairness to Halia, I was not feeling a 100% at the time of our visit, so I didn't get to fully enjoy their offerings. One of the few knocks was the unusually dark restroom, even if stylish

I spend hours looking for somewhere nice to take my mum on a mother daughter date and we finally picked Halia form all the great reviews. Mum saw the lobster on the online menu and declared it would be her main course. Reservations were made swiftly. When we had to shift the time slot to an hour later and had trouble directing the cab to the correct gate, the staff over the phone was extremely pleasant and helpful. The walk to the restaurant was a delightful stroll and I do imagine this being a great place for a romantic dinner date. I chose to have dinner outdoors when reservations were made but due to the humidity and lack of breeze that night, we requested to be shifted indoors. Thankfully there was table available and our waitress was very accommodating. I had trouble getting the attention of several wait staff prior to that and was relieved when we were shifted indoors as i presumed it was too dark for them to see me waving my hand or too noisy to hear me calling out to passing waiters. We are disappointed to find out that the menu we had seen online was an outdated one and that there was no lobsters available. Needless to say the dinner was starting to go downhill and I could sense my mums disappointment as it was meant to be a treat. She managed to pick the recommended chilli crab spaghettini and went with the garden journey. The waiter explained the dishes as it came and I was delighted by the plating. Portions were rather small. Oyster surprised me as i was expecting the goat cheese to overwhelm it but it was delicious, scallops were well seared but i didnt care too much for the chicken wing presse, the frog porridge is really good as the meat was slightly crisp and tender inside while the porridge had a texture I didnt expect as oats were added, angus beef was well marinated and beautifully grilled to a medium rare but was cut too thin for my liking and also had quite a bit of tendon, would have been perfect otherwise. The crab pasta was too spicy for my liking but i expect someone with better tolerance of chilli would have liked it. Mum wasnt impressed with her dish. Was pretty upset by now as mum wasnt enjoying dinner to the extent I called a place in Dempsy to check what time they closed and so when dessert came and she loved it, there was obviously nothing stopping us ordering a second helping of 'the ginger garden' and also the 'snickers'. The ginger garden was so pretty I could hardly bring myself to eat it. The ginger flower sherbet was divine and the meringue in the shape of a pink mushroom was the best I had. Even service had taken an excellent turn when friendly-suit-guy (manager I presume?, my bad for not getting his name) came to the rescue. He surprised us by getting us additional ginger crumble that my mum was loving and recommended 'snickers' which was also beautifully plated. All in all it turned out pretty good towards the end and we didnt have to head to Dempsy as a plan B after all. Would have given it 5 stars if not for the few hiccups

Halia is one of those restaurants I've always wanted to try, and it did not disappoint. I took my boyfriend there for his birthday (one of the few places open on a Monday). Definitely sit outside so you can experience the full ambiance of dining in the gardens. We got the beef to share and it was cooked to perfection. Our waiter provided excellent service, and even took the time to learn our names and called us by our names the entire evening.Afterwards we brought our own dessert and wine and had a picnic in the park :) great evening 
5
We walked across the botanic garden to get here, which was lovely in twilight, and sat outside. It was busy even on a Monday, so definitely need to book. The service was particularly noteworthy (Mae was our server, and was so warmly hospitable we felt very well looked after. I particularly liked the fact she asked how we would like to be addressed, and used our names throughout - without over-using them or being contrived). The food was excellent - we didn't go for the tasting menu, although it was very inviting, but the a la carte also had a great balance of dishes. We opted for the recommended wines with each course, and they had been very well chosen - it was worth trying wines that we would not necessarily have chosen.A really lovely experience in Singapore, I would definitely come back. I imagine the atmosphere (and menu) are quite different during the day, but I would not let the fact that Halia is in the gardens put you off going in the evening - quite the opposite

After a visit to the Orchid Garden we wanted to drink coffee and tea. The prices were extremely i high. We were charged SingD 10.00 for a Chamomile Tea and SindD 8.00 each for 1 Latte and 1 Cappuccino. Apart from the incredibly high prices, the cappuccino had far too much milk. (These prices compare with The Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong, which is a 5+ Star Hotel.
5
We came for brunch this time after having visited a couple of years ago for dinner. Quality of dishes and sevice is still incredible! Their original take on Singapore Sling with Hendricks gin is refreshing and sweet ... I won't be waiting 2 years to go back next time
5
Over the last few years we have dined at Halia many times. Every time we go we love it all the more. Whenever we stay in Singapore and have time for lunch, Halia is THE destination for us. The environment is amazing, the food is always splendid and the staff really know what they're doing.The menu is interesting and a little exotic. The food is prepared with finesse and always looks amazing. Halia has a good wine list and an impressive array of cocktails to suit almost anyone.Highly recommended as a jewel in the already wonderful Botanic Gardens. Take the time to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy one of the best meals you will have
4
Even at a moderate pace in morning heat and humidity the garden'a topography should be challenging enough to allow you the privilege to earn calories here. Nice setting , good service, and you can enjoy a chili crab without needing to shell it. Separately, singapore should print a $28 bill and name it after the singapore sling because that consistently seems to be the retail price around town
4
first time experience,great location and atmosphere and the service staff have been very friendly as we celebrating new years eve
5
I loooooved the feel of this restaurant ...the food and service were also very memorable - we popped in to cool off from our first walk through the Gardens - the Yuzu ice-cream was the best I ever had and I am a yuzu fanatic! I am considering this location as one of several (but not many) for my wedding.....my 1-year-old niece was welcome and well-accommodated....family-friendly

My visit to the restaurant was unplanned but memorable. The restaurant set in the midst of the Ginger Garden section has a prime location near the Orchid Housein the Singapore Botanic Gardens . I viewed the takeaway kiosk nearby but decided upon the restaurant. The setting is simply glorious.No tables were vacant so I was initially seated at a long bench table which I envisaged would possibly become cosy: it did. The chair I found uncomfortable. A two-person setting became vacant. I immediately suggested a move. Staff obliged and the new chair gave greater comfort. I had already ordered by this time.The restaurant in addition to the a la carte menu offers a set menu on weekdays between noon and 2pm. I‚Äôd chosen the 3 course set menu. Time ticked by and, having no reading material, I had little choice but to clock and people watch. The bench table was filled to capacity and a queue lengthened. I‚Äôd made the correct choice. Delays came with several apologies. To whet my appetite, firstly, a delicious freshly-made sorbet arrived with the ordered coffee. My expectations were raised. I like coffee after a meal not before as a general rule. I wasn‚Äôt asked.Food presentation is an integral part of this dining experience. Quantities are definitely not large: taste quite reasonable - perhaps I made a mistake ordering barramundi in Singapore but conversely I promised I would endeavour to replicate the ice-cream when back home. Coffee (brewed) was good. So, final memories are positive.Would I return? Probably, apart from food, just for relaxation purposes in the garden settingA tip ‚Äì when dining in Singapore, prices have a service charge and tax added as well, so expect to pay more than that original price
5
The place is delightful, specially on the terrace surrounded by the greenery of the botanical garden. It is calm and the atmosphere feels even more relaxed with the low level of light. The dishes are elaborate and very well prepared and presented. Choice is pretty wide. Prices are ok. One of the very nice places in Singapore
3
We had booked this restaurant from Australia and were looking forward to spending Christmas Night there with our parents. Our booking time was 6.30pm. We were done and dusted by 7.30pm!!! Talk about fast food! It took longer to get our first order of drinks, then no sooner had the entr√©e plates been cleared, out came the main course. Had no real complaints about the food or service, but was bitterly disappointed in the fact that we would have liked to spend a pleasant evening out in the outdoor area, but felt that we were being rushed out the door. It was expensive by Singapore standards but we did expect that so there were no real surprises 
5
Having read Trip Adviser reviews we weren't sure whether this was worth investing in for our last meal in Singapore. It was more than worth it-excellent value set lunch and ginger infusion to drink. Lovely setting and great service. Don't believe them if they say it may be busy inside-nobody there at 12. First class ingredient combinations. Will keep us going through a Qantas flight overnight.
5
Found Halia by accident when wandering trough the gardens. After lunch but staff were more than helpful accommodating our late seating. Food was truly world class. Beautifully served and presented. We had mains and deserts, both stunning. Reasonably priced for such high quality food, service and location. I would recommend to anyone
4
The service staff have been very friendly and helpful. As i was celebrating my wife's birthday there with my children they provide us with the extra cutlery and even with a surprise birthday dessert for my wife
4
My partner took me here for my birthday recently and the out of the way location confused our driver a lot. It is hard to find.When we finally arrived and found the food, wine, wait staff and band all of a high quality.Beware the price - it‚Äôs not cheap. The most affordable bottle of red wine was around SIN$90 and went up to many hundreds.All in all, not great value for money as a restaurant, but a nice one-off experience
3
To make it short and simple: go for the location (in the middle of the lush green ginger garden as part of the huge Singapore Botanical Garden) - don't go for the food. The latter was absolutely ok, but alone not worth the almost 200 SGD we spent for a very basic and simple one course dinner with two glasses of wine. The menu itself is ok but also no real reason for a visit: the self-declared signature dish is spaghetti with a slightly spicy crab sauce... The service was fast and attentive, though. All in all it was a nice but too expensive evening given the high expectations we had and the by far not stellar food quality we got
5
We lunched at Halia following a recommendation by a friend in Australia . Service was excellent ,food delicious and the surrounds beautiful. If you are in Singapore it is an experience not to be missed.
4
Turned up at Saturday lunchtime without a booking yet still got a good table.The service was professional with a sense of humour(we need more of this in Singapore).The drinks were prompt and well made, recommend the Sangria cocktail and ginger jive mocktail.They were busy and supplied a complementary amuse bouche as the food was slightly delayed(wish more restaurants would do this).The food was excellent apart from the wedges being slightly under done.If this was not so expensive I would be a regula
4
After visiting the beautiful National Orchid Collection we stopped at the Halia for afternoon tea. A beautiful setting, a tasty selection of savoury and sweet treats and excellent service (much better service and value for money than the Fullarton Bay Hotel which we visited a few days later). Recommended
4
My husband and I visited Singapore and the Botanic Gardens were a must.We decided to have lunch at the gardens and this restaurant was a really good option.They offered a three course lunch menu that was excellent. We even found wine from Argentina (we are Argentine).The red potato gnocchi dish was so interesting! The salmon appetizer and deserts including a ice cream and spicy cake were also very good.The restaurant is located within a nice green area, a very quiet location.The gardens are the best we have ever visited.I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are planning to visit the gardens, and of course to visit the gardens if you are visiting Singapore
5
Our last evening in Singapore - it had to be something special! We chose Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens. Before entering we made a short walk around with "what an incredibly beautiful place"-feelings.It was a Friday-evening but the place was not quite full and the number of waiters was so numerous, that we didn√Ç¬¥t need to wait a second in between our courses. The service was polite and knowledgeable but perhaps even a little bit too fast - not leaving time to enjoy a moment before the next course... The second you placed away your cutlery, a waiter was next to you taking away your plate and friendly asking if you had enjoyed. In very few places you can "complain" about that kind of service.We chose Garden Journey with pairing wines to make things easy for ourselves. It was really a set of first class tasty food with aesthetic layout. The menu consisted of specialities like frog "porridge" and stingray fillet end ended with a Ginger Garden -dessert. They were also willing to change this frog "porridge" to a little less exotique course.When leaving, our waiter - Anan - accompanied us to the taxi pick-up place, about 100 meters from the restaurant
5
We had a Saturday brunch here with friends and loved it. The whole experience is great - the setting is beautiful (in the botanic gardens) and they've done a wonderful job with the outdoor part of restaurants. Plenty of fans to keep you cool and it's very beautiful with all the surrounding greenery.The service here is exceptional - they're very, very attentive without being intrusive and all of the wait staff that helped us knew the menu inside and out. The food was great - we all ordered something different and it was rave reviews all around.With its food, service and location, I think this restaurant is a must-do in Singapore
5
This restaurant was a great find that was recommended by a cousin. Went with some friends for dinner, the service was brilliantly efficient, the ambience was fantastic and the food world class. All the dishes were presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. Foie gras with chocolate was especially outstanding. From the moment you reach the door until leaving all the staff were so warm and hospitable, even the cute chef wished us a good night.The experience at halia was one of the very best I've had in Asia, I cannot wait to come back again to try their lunches
3
Really lovely venue in the Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The restaurant itself is not very inspiring... fairly simple wooden tables, white cloths and wooden chairs with plain table decorations, cutlery etc... Rather old-fashioned...Doesn't really make the best of its location. Nice live jazz music. Had the tasting menu which was 5 courses including several of the restaurants signature dishes. OK really.... but nothing special and certainly not worth the apparent accolades the restaurant receives.. Some elements were overcooked; some under-seasoned. reasonable price for the food. Wine list average; OK on prices but quality not much good...Nice for the venue..
5
Excellent restaurant. Located next to the Botanic Garden gate. Loved the atmosphere, excellent quality of food; had the goose liver with chocolate sauce and pineapple foam - divine. Never expected! Main course (sea bass) and desert (variations of chocolate) superb quality, and taste!! The food, the atmosphere and the wine was worth the money spent
5
Had lunch at this wonderful place and it was nothing short of excellent. Having been here before and left with a memorable experience, it's no surprise that this was the first place that came to mind which has a warm and homely feel to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. When we arrived at Halia, it was nice that we were adknowledged by name by Diana and Faizal, who instantly recognized us as though we never left. We were led to a beautiful table on the outdoor veranda where we had a refreshing view of greenery and fresh air. To our surprise, even staff we've met for the first time greeted us by our names, for example our server for the day, Rena. It might seem like a simple gesture but it can really make someone's day knowing that there is a genuine effort put in their top class hospitality. Now the food. We ordered the set lunch which we feel is great value for money for a 3 course meal. We had our favourite black angus beef rendang which is DELICIOUS. Again I must compliment the feeling one can take home with them after a dining experience here. Whatever it is you're doing to maintain this exceptional level of service, please keep it up! Will definitely come back again and again
5
Excellent restaurant. Located next to the Botanic Garden gate. Somehow expensive but well worthy considering the quality of service and meals. Atmosphere during lunch is very relaxing.
4
We come here because of Singapore friends introduce to us. The food and service are good. The choices of menu are great. The atmosphere here is very good and romantic here. The drinks here are also recommended.
4
I had a watermelon/tomato salad with goat cheese which was *beautifully* presented. I then had the chili crab which was spicy and wonderful. The service was outstanding. I loved it!
5
I went there for a birthday dinner. While on the way there, we got lost and I nearly gave up. When I called the restaurant, Diane/Diana picked up the phone and actually offered to pick us up at cafe verde. We were surprised by the offer and yet we were delighted that she actually went an extra mile. She took like 7mins and voila... there she was walking towards us. She's very friendly and helpful and knowledgeable I must say. The ambience is perfect, I love it. Her colleague let us to our table (indoor) and Diane came to us and asked if we want any water and let us settled down. All the staffs are knowledgeable and friendly, we are very happy with the service and feel very comfortable. The food is awesome, I had the striploin (medium) and my partner had the new zealand rack of lamb (medium). However, my partner didnt like the lamb being done medium. We asked Diane if the chef can grilled a lil bit more to medium well, she said not a problem. She took the plate and then a little while later, gave my partner an orange sorbet (complimentary of course) to indulge while waiting for the lamb. How sweet is that!!! The orange sorbet is delicious too, very tangy and refreshing! The lamb came back and we realised they changed to a whole new lamb and this time its medium well and the taste was delicious!! It just melts in the mouth. After that, the dessert came and they sang a birthday song for my partner, he was overwhelmed. Overall, everything was perfect on that day and we will definitely come back again for our anniversary dinner and this time I am gonna order the lamb for myself
4
This restaurant provides a sense of privacy and relax ambience to those who dine there.The outdoor seating has a serene view of greenery.The staff were knowledgeable and always ready to serve you with enthusiasm. The food was really good. Would recommend their salad, roasted corn fed chicken breast and carrot cake for the 3- course meal
4
To celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, I wanted to make it extra special. After reading some recommendations, I decided to try Halia, and it sure live to its reputation. The night started out with a romantic walk from through Singapore's iconic garden.We were warmly greeted by the manager, Faizal, who even when out of the way to know our names. For starters, we decided on the Frog porridge, though it does not sound appetizing, we agreed that it is one of the best appetizers we had- definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Halia. For mains, I had the Roasted New Zealand Rack of Lamb which was prepared very well, however, my partner who had the Oven-baked Chilean Sea Bass, had a distinctive smell and taste from the fish and was too salty, and be improved.However, what really stood out and made our visit to Halia unforgettable, was the outstanding service- every single staff was polite, attentive and wanted only the best for us. They even when the extra mile to make a birthday greeting on our dessert. To put it simply, if you are looking for a place with outstanding service and food, you cannot go wrong with Halia
4
I first came here a couple of years ago and the service was so shocking i walked out halfway through. I decided to give it another go and the service was fantastic, couldn't be better.The food was excellent, choices very good, range good and delivery very good.Wine and drink choices were pretty good and the cost was comparable to other competitors.Definitely worth a try if you're in the Botanic Gardens or want a special late night dinner

Visiting the Botanical Garden in Singapore was high on our list of things to do on our recent trip. We wanted to eat lunch while we were out, so we decided to combine efforts and eat at Halia. I admit that we were not thrilled about the prices as we looked at the menu, but we were hungry and didn't want to have to find another option so we decided to stay. "Wow" is all I can say about our food....it was absolutely delicious and it was one of our favorite meals! The Chili Crab Pasta was amazing!

Had a nice celebration dinner at Halia with a group of friends and it was a very pleasant experience.We sat outside, the weather was not too hot or humid and the greenery surrounding us contributed to a beautiful ambience.Even though I did find the prices a little on the higher end of the spectrum, the food was tasty. The staff were very professional and polite.I will be going back again to try out their brunch menu
5
Went to Halia on the afternoon 19th October for a lazy brunch. Reservation ws made with Mr Faizal and i was served by Ms Sarah upon arrival. Food was just as good as the first time i was there. I was sunsequently given utmost attention by Dennis and Nur. They were most polite and with never ending smiles. The brunch ended with a very special Ice Cream treat by the staffs of Halia and a birthday song. I want to thank Faizal, Sarah, Nor and Dennis for all that they had done for me
5
Brought mum there for lunch when we were nearby and had a really sumptuous meal in this restaurant. Can't get over the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio in Truffle Oil and the Chilli Crab Spaghettini.. The set lunch is awesome and service is really good too.
5
As I know this restaurnat due to some meeting event, I visited with my parents here. Staff is very friendly and approachable. Also I enjoyed atmosphere as this restaurant is surroneded by the garden. I can recommend signature food, chili crab spaghetti & frog congee!
4
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. It was my favourite Singapore dining experience in the 4 days we were there. We caught the hop on hop off bus to the gardens and had the 2 course special which was so delicious. I recommend.
4
We shared lunch with our friends who were visiting from Australia, before heading around the gardens. Tucked away in a lush garden,, sitting on the terrace, we had a wonderful time. Food excellent and served hot. Staff were friendly and efficient.

After a late arrival from the UK the night before we slept late and missed breakfast! Eager not to waste any more time we set off for the Botanic Gardens and found Halia, what a lovely find it was. As it was a public holiday they were serving the brunch menu which was perfect for us, we sat inside in the aircon room, were served by polite and attentive staff, good menu choice, on the expensive side but worth every cent as it was beautifully presented and tasted just as good. We all ordered two items, the waitress did suggest a half size of the one of the dishes as it was very large, we were grateful for that as it would have been too much (we were accordingly charged half price for that dish too)Would definitely recommend for brunch and would try again if in Singapore again
5
A surprise birthday dinner celebration that turned out to be one of my most memorable one. Everything from service to food and right down to ambience was perfect. A special shout out to Faizal, the host, who was very helpful and accommodating to our needs. Service from Faizal and the rest of the staff was above my expectations. After this lovely experience, it's safe to say I would definitely be coming back for more! Well done Halia! Two thumbs up
5
We were meant to head to another outlet. When we stopped by to ask the staff for directions, we found them so warm and friendly that we decided to have our brunch there instead.The service was as friendly once inside the restaurant and we were served with no waiting time (which is great when you have a hungry little one). We thank the team for our wonderful brunch, namely Faizal, Diana and Ravan (? our waiter)
5
I have been to Halia at Botanic Garden few days ago. I had a complimentary lunch voucher for 2 persons. Firstly, it was fantastic. food were very delicious and amazing. Also staff (Faizal and Sarah) were very approachable and friendly. I will sure recommend this restaurant to my friends and colleagues. Thank you for your great food and service

I just came back from this restaurant. I chose this restaurant because of good reviews and setting. It was my birthday and I was expecting nice and quiet dinner. I had their 4 course set dinner with beef (S$98), and my husband had their lab and ordered more veggies. Food was OK, but very common ingredients and presentation. What was unexpected was the setting. I requested a table indoor when I booked, and we were given a table next to a family with two small children. When I saw the kids, I wanted to change the table, but they said that outside tables were fully booked. Kids were shouting, going in and out from the glass door behind them, and just running around the restaurant. The parents did nothing, so as the waiting people. I thought it was just like a family restaurant, but the price was NOT (S$230). I chose this restaurant because I thought it would have a nice setting, but it was a big disappointment. Singapore has a lot nicer restaurants with this price. I will not go back to this restaurant again and I would NOT recommend to anyone
5
This place was our amazing discover while we were walking down to street to find someplaces to hide from the hot weather here.We were impressed by the green outside. We totally enjoyed the lunch here. We ordered crab spaggatini, which were absolutely fresh and tasty.It was a bit pricey but it worths due to its quality of food and service.Attentive and smiley staff.I love it
4
Dining among the plants and serenity make this a must dine location in Singapore. They have a concise menu selction that fits both the location and the atmosphere. Make sure you try their signature Ginger Nougat for dessert.
4
Just had a cup of tea and a cold drink after visiting the Orchid Garden. I was made to feel as welcome as if I'd ordered a dinner for six people. Very nice setting and excellent service.
5
The Singapore Botanic Gardens is one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. Add in a meal at Halia Restaurant to complete your trip to the Gardens.The setting of the restaurant amidst the Ginger Gardens is spectacular. It's like bringing the outside in with a restaurant patio open to the Gardens. It was a bit warm at first, but the ceiling fans helped. The service at the restaurant is beyond spectacular with a warm and friendly staff who will cater to your needs. Our waiter was kind enough to ask us if there was anything else as part of our trip to Singapore that he could help us with - directions, recommendations, anything.The food was spectacular. We ordered the set lunch meals and each chose different appetizers and entrees and found each and every dish spectacular, tasty and amazing. The coconut panna cotta dessert was brilliant.This meal at Halia was the highlight of our trip to Singapore and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend that anyone give this restaurant a try
5
Had a great lunch here after a couple of hours exploring the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Prices are a little expensive but you get what you pay for - I had the crab spaggatini, which was delicious, and others in our party had the lamb and the fish, which were also hits.The location is wonderful and the ambiance is calm and cool, which was a welcome relief from the heat and humidity!
5
Dining in such a beautiful setting was made even more special by the great food and excellent service. Dennis Castro and his team were particularly helpful with recommendations and the restaurant proved to be a big hit with our young grandchildren. It really made our visit to the Botanical Gardens even more enjoyable

A friend of mine and myself decided to go to Halia for a catchup session. Halia is a hidden gem of a restaurant which is located in the heart of the Singapore Botanical Gardens.Faisal, Diana and Allen were wonderful and very helpful with recommendations. We both decided on the 3-course lunch set menu. Starters began with a 'House-cured salmon topped with English mustard' and I myself had a 'Mayura Station Wagyu beef carpaccio', we then moved on to the main course.I had 'Rangers Valley Black Angus beef rendang' which was served with a bowl of fragrant jasmine rice while my friend decided on the restaurant's signature dish 'Halia Chilli Crab spaghettini'. The beef rendang was excellent with strong flavored that exploded in your mouth and one thing that I loved about the beef was that instead of the usual tough cut of meat traditionally used for this type of dish, it was a very tender cut which went well with the jasmine rice. The Chilli crab spaghettini was very unique in taste with hints of ginger which blended well with the chili crab sauce. We ended off with an Apple and Pear Crumble, served with salted Caramel ice cream, together with a Ginger Nougat Parfait, accompanied by caramelized pineapple topped with spiced pineapple sauce. All-in-all, it was a great restaurant experience, which was complimented by the almost Colonial-era feel of dining in the Botanic Gardens. We quite enjoyed the tranquility and food, and would definitely recommend it for a romantic dinner with loved ones

Had a hard time choosing a restaurant for dinner with ma girlfriend on my bday and at the last minute she introduced Halia at botanical garden to me and it turned out be a great decision . Was little on the expensive side but it's all worth for the quality of food and service they catered. Ensure that you go through tyersall ave. coz it's a 10 minute walk thru the garden if you are taking cluny road. We had reserved over the phone though that was not required as the place was not very crowded. Good choice of drinks , delicious and well presented food , caring and well mannered bunch of people... Overall, a perfect combo of nature and food with everything you could ask for on a candlelight dinner. (The bill for 2 came around s$269 with a bottle of wine, an appetizer and two main courses
5
Set in the luxuriance of the Halia Garden, this restaurant exploits fully both the natural environment for its seating of glass-doored comfortable indoors and sheltered rustic outdoors, and the ginger plant (its namesake) for its menu of ginger-infused savouries, sweets and beverages.The service is welcoming and personal as the Vietnamese waiter at our table would take pains to explain the items on the 3-tiered tea tray.The high tea set supplies a generous variety of tastes that are visually exciting with jelly in egg shells and ginger ice-cream atop financiers. From the deliciously ginger-perfumed salmon gravlax rosettes to the ginger-steeped panna cotta in glass jars, the flavours are surprisingly delightful.Drinks hot or cold come ginger-infused for a calming effect.What a perfect way to while away a languid afternoon
3
I expected much more from the food. It was boring by any standards and given the price, it was really disappointing. When we got appetizer, we were asked 5x if everything was OK - it was supposed to be romantic lunch but I spend more time talking to waiter than to my companion. Will not come again

For pictures and more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatTea (the event) is the best thing that the English have invented. Nothing beats whiling the afternoon away in the garden with buttery and crusty scones, clotted cream and jam. Best place to do it in Singapore? Try The Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens, a romantic and picturesque restaurant tucked away in in the lush foliage centrally located in town.My frazzled nerves were soothed by the Chilled Halia Infusion, a lightly spiced tea sweetened with honey, while we waited for our tiered tea set to be served. You could pick other teas or brewed coffee as part of your set. I much prefered the chilled version over the hot one that i had during brunch the last time.Always start with the scone when doing tea. It kind of sets the tone for tea (that and you really should eat it when it's hot) and i knew i was in for a great time when i bit into the crusty and dense pastry slathered with chantilly cream and a tinge of orange ginger jam.There's a nice balance of sweet and savory bites in the tea set, which i alternated between. The Gorgonzola and caramelized onion quiche had an absolutely buttery tart with a light blue cheese filling. There's also the poached chicken and smoked paprika finger sandwich and the meh-ish Wagyu beef rendang samosa. The sweet plate consists of the delicious scones, the towering coconut panna cotta with mango, passion fuit and lychee. I quite enjoyed the moist carrot cake with cr√É¬®me cheese icing and certainly wouldn't mind seconds. I was impressed by the Ginger flower macaroon which had quite the perfect candy shell and slightly chewy center.For $28 per individual set, I have to say this is a steal for tea. I'll definitely recommend this for a tea party with the girls! Don't miss out on this lovely tea at The Halia, Singapore Botanic Gardens which is available every weekend and Public Holiday from 3 - 5pm. Reservations are not accepted for brunch and tea service though
3
My title says it all. It was a good restaurant, responsive service, pricing in comparison to food choices...well? I really felt that it was lacking in food choices.
I would go back to eat as the food and service tasted good.

Halia is a delightful high-class restaurant at the Singapore Botanical Gardens, with accommodation both inside and outside.The outside accommodation is on a very well-sheltered wooden terrace, surrounded by lush foliage.On the recommendation of relatives we booked in here in the afternoon for High Tea. The first thing to say is that the service is outstanding, with personal and very polite attentiveness displayed throughout the process.The menu for high tea is far from the conventional, featuring a fusion of traditional Western-style and more subtle oriental confections and sweetmeats. There is an outstanding range of teas and beverages available and these are explained carefully to you by the waiter.The ambience is very gracious but still extremely relaxing and informal. I would regard this High Tea as a great way to get the most out of a visit to the Botanical Gardens. The volume of food is not excessive and the prices are very reasonable for the standard of cuisine provided, which is top quality and quite unique.The restaurant is set in the Ginger Garden with waterfalls just nearby and this adds to the special atmosphere of the whole experience
5
This was my second visit to Halia at the Botanical Garden. Great atmosphere. 1 of the nicer fine dining in town! Good value lunch and weekend brunch.Faizal Wahab - the restaurant host simply amazing. He recognize his regular diner at his fingertips. Sarah the waiter and Ronnie were great and paying lots of attention at the dining table. Great service!As for the food, must try the beef rendang with jasmine rice. Very beautifully local taste using wagyu category. Very tender. 3 course set lunch at 32++ per person. Good value for money. Food plus experience. Must try cocktail - Heavenly Halia, cosmopolitan and Singapore Sling.Dessert was also nice. Keep it up Halia. Looking forward for my next visit
4
We walked in as we were captivated by this beauitful restaurant in the park. I had the seabass and my husband had the carpacio . The food was delicious and the ambience is great as we sat outdoors. price is a bit expensive but the experience is good. The service is good with friendly staff. Recommende
5
One of the best restaurants we have been to in Singapore, in terms of quality of food and the service. Each and every course of food was of excellent quality, in particular the Wagyu Carpaccio really stood out. I'd recommend the Al Fresco dining area as that has a nice charm to it.Not that pricey considering the quality as we've paid a lot more at other "good" restaurants for either slightly above average food quality or service that wasn't that great. So this place is worth the money spent.We'll be looking forward to going back there again soon

Feels like fine dining in a garden.Warm reception upon arrival and service staffs make an effort to adhere to our requests. We wanted to have an indoor seating, however did not specified in my reservation and was given a outdoor seating instead. We were promised if there were indoor seats available they would move us in. We were pleased that they remembered our requests even after second serving of our food and we were moved to indoor seats. Thumbs up for this.Food:- French confit duck BrikThe duck confit, unlike others, is wrapped in crispy skin and does not comes in a drumstick. It is all meat stuffed in the skin which makes it easier to cut and eat.- Oven-baked Chilean seabass filletVery fresh seabass and the mushrooms are to taste.Price:- Price is on a steep side but for the quality of the food and the service staffs, it's still worth the priceLocation:It's inside SBG. Need a car or cab to get in, otherwise will be abit of walk from MRT.Overall:Nice ambience, good settings and quality food. It would be perfect if some of the dishes from Raffles Hotel Halia were offered in SBG e.g. Halia Chilli Crab and Truffle Fries
5
I'm an absolute critic when it comes to food, ambience and service. Most restaurants get 1-2 factors right but never the perfect score. What i absolutely adore and i mean genuine appreciation in the Halia Raffles Hotel & Halia Botanical Gardens is the excellent service! They are ever so consistent in delivering warm, friendly and so wonderful service that makes you feel so pampered. Excellent dining location for anniversaries, birthdays or just a special splurge. Food surprise my palates and exploded in my mouth. Every dish is an enjoyment and an absolute delight. We had the set meal n a bottle of chandon. The set meal is the perfect option of choice if you've not been to the restaurant before. It gives you a variety of the best dishes offered in the house. With soft music and crickets chirping in the background, outdoor seating is a must. Finally, what most patrons would not be concerned with but is a stickler for me, toilets and the cleanliness of it. Its a 5 star for me. Paper towels for hands, tissues for the face and the careful consideration of making sure the bugs do not share the same space as the you when you need that private moment is fantastic! Thank you Allan for the wonderful service and the entire Halia team for such a memorable experience. I'm now a convert and will be back to both the Halia @ Raffles Hotel and the Halia @ Botanical Gardens for that unforgettable dining experience again.

You need to be specific if you're getting a taxi to Halia in the SBG to go to the nearest pick up to the Ginger Garden, otherwise you risk a long walk. Not that it isn't a very pretty walk but a little difficult to navigate in the dark if you're heading to dinner. The open air tables have a lovely ambience - the tables inside are unremarkable - there's also a rather odd smell from the open kitchen. The food is, well, a bit odd. The flavour combinations don't really work, or go a step too far. A lovely dish of carpaccio has a variety of toppings - most of which you can do without. The service is prompt and welcoming but it's let down by the standard of food which is just not good enough to justify the price
5
My wife and me went to this place on our anniversary for brunch and enjoyed the serene garden ambience and great food. The best dish we liked was poached eggs on brioche, dill hollandaise, Swiss brown mushroom, spinach & tomato, shaved honey baked ham which was like another version of Eggs Benedict. The chilli crab spaghettini was also quite good. The friendly staff always wear a smile and were quite attentive. We ordered 3 dishes and were served in less than 15 mins. We will definitely visit again
4
Botanic Gardens with kids can be tiring and hungry business - and Halia is a great place to cool down and feast on some exceptionally good food. They take pride in their dinner - but we always seem to be able to get there for lunch... And love it. Service is caring, important with kids. It's somewhere we look forward to going again!
4
Very romantic setting and restaurant. Very nice menu, good service. Food is very good -- the salads in particular are excellent. Main courses were a little uneven, especially the chili crab spaghetti, which I believe is a signature dish.
5
Very good food, we tried also the Singapore Sling, which was perfect.One thing I can't get used to it in the area is that waiters will assist you regardless of your seat and waiter and sometimes information gets lost on the way. You ask a waiter for something and either you get it doubled, or you don't get it at al
5
My husband and I had our lunch there, it was such an amazing experience. The food was really nice and we were welcomed by such a lovely staff, Kengar, who was so lovely to speak with and had such a professional manner. We absolutely loved our experience there. Also the restaurant has the lovely garden view
4
Like many others, I was busy online reading on which restaurants to patronize for a special dinner event and I am very happy that I settled on Halia @ SBG. It is really not a big restaurant and tables with A/C is rather limited, although there are tables for alfresco dining.Although the walk from the car park to the restaurant was rather dark, we were not disappointed upon entering the restaurant. The ambiance was quiet and the decor was simple but tasteful.The highlight however, was the service...which was very prompt and efficient. The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable regarding the menu. We were so impressed that we actually went along with many of the recommendations that were given. The staff were non-invasive and gave diners the privacy when needed. The food did not disappoint at all...the yummy bread was 'free flow' and they were generous with offering it. The lamb we ordered was cooked to near perfection and the dessert was a very sweet ending to a wonderful meal. The portioning was sufficient and the plating was simple without being boring.I am surely looking forward to my next visit there, perhaps this time in the day so that we can walk around the lovely grounds after what I am certain will be another fulfilling meal
4
I have been to Singapore many times and really enjoyed this combination of the gardens and restaurant, While it may have been a business trip, I consider the restaurant so warm and inviting, the food so good and the service so excellent - I felt that I was among friends
5
My wife and I had our wedding anniversary dinner at this restaurant last night. It did not disappoint. The website stated that it was one of the top 50 best restaurants in Asia. I cannot say that I have been to the other 49, but this was definitely one of the best restaurants I have spent time and money in, in the world. Off the bat the service was IMPECCABLE. All round. It couldn't be more perfect.The location was also perfect for anyone wanting to have a nice quite romantic dinner together. All elements, service, food, ambience surroundings all in(did I say) perfect harmony.Now the food:The bread was home cooked freshly baked focaccia bread. Lovely, and fabulous. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip was exquisite. Again Perfect balance.We started with the Carparcio. It was a balance of flavors that was quit nice.We then had a New Zealand rack of lamb bad Seabass for our main. The lamb was PERFECTION one of the best that we ever had any where in the world (we do travel a lot). The Seabass was good. I just have to recommend that they hold back a bit on the garlic sauce. It tended to overpower the fish.They then gave us a mango/ginger sherbet - to cleanse our palettes. Very nice.Unfortunately we did not have any room for dessert.The bill was also a surprise. It wasn't as expensive as I thought.I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone
5
We had been to the Orchid Garden for my birthday treat and just stumbled upon the Halia. Kengar and her team were really welcoming. We had a Sing Sling (one of the best on the island and we've tried a few!) and pondered the menu. The frog porridge starter was recommend and being in an adventurous mood I decided to try it. Wow I'm glad I did, it was delicious, packed full of flavour. I followed that with the triple chocolate dessert. Yum yum. Hubbie had the waygu beef starter (still raving about that) and the ginger garden dessert. We are definitely going back and will take visitors there. Thank you everyone there, you helped make my day very special :

We had lunch at Halia whilst visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The service was fine and the ambience of the restaurant really good, but it was let down by some of its food, which was not up to the standard expected for an establishment that charges quite high prices. To be fair, I was asked after the meal if I was dissatisfied and why and I explained where I felt they had let themselves down. There was a nice apology and an offer of dessert, which I declined as we needed to continue our exploration of the Gardens
4
We loved our lunch at Halia. The setting is very peaceful, which is rare for Singapore, and the food was fantastic. We were travelling on a budget, but the three course set lunch menu meant we could still include Halia in our itinerary. My only gripe is that even though I booked online - and had a reservation confirmation - they still had no record of the booking. If they were full it would have been a problem but since it was mid-week they still had a good table for us
5
Strugglingling to like this sanitised city cf earlier visits in 1979 & 80's. Miss the great vibe of old Bugis Street, top notch chilli crab with ice cold Tigers, all life found there etc. But life moves on, change happens & no point in big harking back to the past. Botanical Gardens are engaging (divine orchids) but it's hot hot hot. To my delight I come across Halia in the midst of the Ginger Garden. Gorgeous ambiance, very charming staff & delish Sing Sling to kick off. Chilli crab spaghettini totally rings my bell - a fave pasta combined with mmmm mmmm chilli crab. Coconut panna cotta with fresh mango & lychee granita accompanied by a lovely Alsace Riesling..o yes. Superb macchiato to finish. Not cheap but dread to think what it would cost in London town. And since I've been eating (very nice) vego in various cheapo food courts in down home shopping malls here in Singerstown this is a super treat
5
Tasty crab chilli spagettini, nice place, perfect view from terrace. Very pleasant staff and service as anywhere in Singapore
5
The carrot cake is delicious. The best carrot cake I ever tasted in Singapore :D Very relaxing outdoor setting!
2
Lovely place. Great service. But my breakfast - their Sunday special was very cold and not all that interesting anyway. Toast wasn't toasted properly. For those of you thinking: why didn't I send it back? You are right. I did complain afterwards and received a nice apology and a complimentary Bloody Mary, But still, a disappointing Brunch
4
Was out with family at Singapore Botanical Garden on Sunday morning and fondly recalled Halia Restaurant in the garden where i once hosted a company brunch in 2004/5. It was a beautiful restaurant amid the lush greenery then. And Halia @ Botanical is still a beautiful restaurant today and even better yet, with better food and service team! Despite the lack of advance reservation & a full-house, we were lucky to get a table for 6 of us & 1 2yo within 15min And thanks to Jufrie & Rena top-notched service & care, we had a wonderful brunch. I can't imagine how amazing they will be if it was dinner.I was at Halia @ Raffles Hotel and I was sorely disappointed with the lack of characteristic compare to Halia @ Botanical. So, if you want to experience Halia, it has to be Halia @ Botanical enjoying ginger-theme dishes amidst the ginger-theme section of Singapore best garden.Thank you once again, Jufrie, Rena & Faizal. Do continue to make Halia @ Botanical beautiful..
5
This was a delightful experience. The surroundings of the botanic gardens was beautiful and it was right next to the orchid gardens which was very convenient. The service was excellent, when we dropped a fork, the second we dropped it, a waiter quickly replaced it. They were very friendly and attentive. The food was epic. I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked and soft, I loved it. My sister had a pasta which I tasted and it was wonderful, just enough spices and sauce. The rest of us had 'Harisa chicken' it was really good and the bread was amazing as well. It's great for occasions as well. We will definitely be back
3
Went there for lunch, service was good and the setting was indeed very tranquil and relaxing. We had the lunch special ravioli which was overcooked - tasty but very soggy. We also had the wagyu beef sandwich - beef was tasty but very chewy . I did not know if wagyu was supposed to be that chewy or not. The setting was unbeatable but the average food meant we won't rush back or recommend . I do recommend for drinks but you get better food at a lot other places for this price bracket
5
I booked the Halia online as we do not live in Singpore and I wanted to organise a special dinner for my husband's birthday. I found the onine booking prompt and appreciated the email reminder on the morning of our dinner reservation. Being greeted at the door by friendly wait staff was a taste to our entire evening where we recieved very attentive and personalised service. Our meal started with complimenatry homemade bread and an amuse busch. A delightful start to a delicious meal. My husband and I ordered starters and as a our teenage daughters didn't want one they were offered extra bread to enjoy at the same time. Our main meals were all cooked to perfection, and my husband was very happy he was able to order the chilli crab spaghetti from the lunch menu. Our evening finished with 3 different chocolate desserts for my daughters and myself. The staff brought out their signature ginger garden dessert for my husband and sang him Happy Birthday. All four desserts were beautifully presented and tasted amazing! I wanted to have a memorable, special evening with my family for my husband's birthday and the Halia delivered in every way. We will definitely come back on our next trip to Singapore
2
We had a birthday celebration at Halia. The service I must say is excellent. They are very attentive. The entrees were nice but not worth the money you pay. The mains were very disappointing. Average taste and not cooked well. I ordered a medium done lamb rack that came back uncooked in the middle
5
Eating in restaurants in Singapore is not necessarily a "cheap" option, and this is really no exception. However with a significant birthday for our mum and the fact that our family is rarely together due to our geographical spread, we decided to try Halia at the Singapore Botanical Gardens. It did not disappoint! The food is exceptional, service attentive but not over bearing and the location is very peaceful. The menu was well explained with the option for degustation or a la carte menu. We all decided on a la carte so we could almost experience the whole menu. Very thoughtful extras of fresh bread and a tasting of tuna mousse whilst we waited on entrees. Excellent wine lists, even a couple from NZ which was unexpected. The portions were of excellent size and had ample choices for vegetarians. We were able to watch some of the staff prepare certain dishes in a open kitchen which always adds to the experience of great food. There was great choice of seafood and as a seafood loving family we had ample choice. The sea bass in Japanese paper parcel stunning, a carpaccio of beef sublime, goats cheese and beet root salad mouth was mouth watering. To top the night off the birthday girl received a complimentary beautiful dessert with candle and birthday wishes, she was totally overwhelmed! We would highly recommend Halia and we look forward to going back next time we are in Singapore. Thank you for making this a special night for us all
5
We stumbled upon Halia on our way through the Singapore Botanical gardens and so glad we did! Fantastic food (I had the chicken, carrot pur√É¬©e, potato galette and Brussel sprouts and dessert was apple and pear crumble with salted caramel ice cream) Was delicious and the service was faultless. If we were staying closer I would have gone back for dinner
4
I love the place, it is so peaceful. The food is delicious and the presentation is beautiful. Service is also very good.
5
Great food from different parts of the world, best service I have had in a long time and the atmosphere on the outside Terra's is just stunning!
5
This was my second time to the restaurant. It is nicely set-up in the peaceful environment of the Botanic Gardens. The food is delicious and the staff are very friendly and helpful.
4
Halia is a fine dining restaurant located within the grounds of the Singapore Botanical Garden. The food at Halia is some of the best we've had in Singapore. But, we came away a little hungry!! That is saying a lot coming from me, because I am not a big eater to begin with. If you decide to go, brunch just might be the best option for this restaurant.
4
This is a lovely oasis ofwhite table cloths great service and delicious food near the orchid garden. Sit inside and cool off. It is pretty expensive by singapore standards but the set lunch worked out about 40 dollars for 3 courses and pay the extra for the chili crab its delicious. Good for a quiet sit down and a chat.Nice non alcoholic drinks and admire the gardens outside and we saw a monkey
5
Staff were absolutely friendly and accommodating. Apart from being delicious, food was creatively presented and portion sizes were just right. The ambience in the evening was very peaceful and nice with candles on the table and the Botanic Gardens outside. Had a great evening and would highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion
4
We were invited to a reception hosted by a local family to celebrate their son's engagement.The chef did a marvelous job of mouth-watering fusion delicacies - starters: tuna tartare trio; entree: beetroot carpaccio and foie gras; main course; confusing choice of main courses: Sirloin, Australian snapper; and for vegetarians too a choice. The Valroha chocolate fondant, poached strawberry, yuzu ice cream and shiso was to die for!!The music was at times very loud, but the staff lowered the volume when requested. Service was great and we were well taken care of besides well fed
5
This place has exceeded all my expectations. Service was on top of everything, the head honcho man served our food and came by to talk to us. Food was delectable and the drinks were top notch. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Views are awesome and just an overall amazing experience
4
Had lunch here after visiting the orchid garden. Always nice to sit at a table with a wite table cloth. The open kitchen is also attractive, and above all, it is located in a garden which gives it an open, relaxed atmosphere. The staff is very service oriented and friendly which compensated it when they brought out a main course which I did not order. As the prices were high I expected more oustanding dishes. This only worked out for the dessert, coconut panna cotta with passion fruit juice and lychee at the side, which was excellent. The location in the park is admirable, so therefor worthwile to visit. You can choose to have a table inside (airconditioned) or outside.

Having been to Halia at Raffles, when we had an evening visit to the gardens, decided to have dinner at the sister restaurant there. We were the only diners, suspect they are more busy at lunchtime, but the service and food were excellent. Friendly but not intrusive waiter gave very good descriptions of dishes, and advice re choices. And in lovely surroundings
3
I had a lovely lunch at Halia, the food was great and I choose from the set lunch menu. It was priced at $32.00 for 3 courses but beware the added charges in fine print, for some of the selection and the drinks are pricey.
5
Great Service, nice quiet location in the Ginger garden, reasonably priced menu with variety, brunch all day on Sundays.
Great variety of fresh juices
5
This was an unusual dining experience where the restaurant is nestled in a huge garden. While the sky dimmers, the restaurant feels cozier. It's a great place to have romantic dinners. The staff were friendly and the food tasted superb. From my table, I could see the Caucasian chef busying preparing our food.After dinner, a romantic stroll through the garden back to the main entrance was a refreshing experience for nature lovers like us

Third time lucky- I went here for a work lunch and they have come a long way. The portions are decent for lunchtime and the choice and quality is good. They have a new chef. He's introducing more new items to menu and a friendly person. It took a while to get attention for bill so if in rush keep it in mind. They are all friendly so maybe a staffing issue. Above all a great improvement and well deserved for a great location outside the a.c. of office blocks and in amongst the green of the Botanics. Worth a trip under the new chef.
5
What a lovely restaurant. Location, food, service & staff excellent. Made to feel very welcome. Use of mr & ms Paul & Caroline was a lovely touch and made us feel familiar & cared for. The food was delicious - the oysters were gorgeous. If you want a romantic dinner for 2 or a special family celebration this is the place to go. We will be back again. I quite fancy the brunch
5
amazing place for great food. the service was impeccable. my lamb steak came a little late and the staff promptly served me a salad as a form of apology. very good atmosphere. my only gripe would be that it was quite difficult to get to the place. especially at night, as there were very little signs leading to the restaurant. had a great experience though! (

We had lunch here after visiting the Orchard garden. The food was delicious and service was fabulous. We sat in the outdoor verandah, which is covered and offers a beautiful view of the gardens. A brief storm came through, which added to the atmosphere and we stayed very dry on the verandah and enjoyed watching the rain. Staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Any extra charges for certain meal selections were written on the menu and explained by staff before taking the order. The Singapore sling cocktail was superb and well worth the price, wines are very good quality and food well presented. Would highly recommend lunch here, you can stick to the set menu and keep the price low or indulge and try the cocktails and other menu selections
3
Halia is located inside the Botanical Gardens. We went there for high tea. The high tea is of good selections and variety, the taste is average and comparable to many of the other high teas offered in other Singapore locations. This is a place to bring visitors who have come to Singapore and would be a wonderful add onafter a walk through the Botanic gardens. Nice atmosphere but nothing spectacular for the food/service itself
4
I always frequent Singapore botanic gardens for a walk and always pass by this restaurant. One Sunday, finally decided to try it out. Had eggs benedict which was average. Ambience was great. However, some servers seemed arrogant and unfriendly. Some were too friendly though. Found the service quite strange and off
4
The setting for this restaurant is lovely, in the park, and a great place to end a few hours stroll at the botanical gardens. Be sure to order the Singapore crab. This national dish was delicious and followed up by the local icecream assortment was one of our most memorable meals in this city filled with great restaurant
4
A relaxing, cozy nice garden place. Food was good. Would recommend it. A perfect venue for couple on their first date.
5
A very pretty venue in the evening surrounded by palm trees and the lush ginger gardens - the venue is worth a visit in evening. We particularly like dining out on Jazz Nights - live jazz. Enjoy the "ginger dishes"...Halia's specialty.
4
I first chanced upon this restaurant while strolling through the park on my own. I was initially disappointed that set lunch would no longer be served even though I was merely 10 minutes past the time. Still, it's a lovely respite from the usual Singaporean humidity and heat. Lovely garden with a quaint setting. Food is nice as always. I have gone there twice now, both for lunch and it's always a nice experience. Pricing is not over-the-top. Typically the same pricing that we would pay if we dined at a nice restaurant elsewhere for lunch
4
Visited the restaurant on a wet afternoon... Door hostess was prompt in getting my date and I a table (indoor). Ordered their ginger tea and I would say, it's nice and refreshing. Food was nice and well presented. A but pricey though. The assistant manager, Redzuan was super friendly and knows his food product. Thumbs up to him for his excellent services. Will go back on special occasion
3
Had lunch at Halia this weekend. It's a favored haunt of the "ladies wot lunch" set. They were busy nd we had to wait a while for a table for three, and oddly we weren't invited to sit and wait. Spoke with the manager a little and after ten minutes or so, we were seated. We both ordered ice coffee and a pastry basket while waiting for our third. The bread was good, the coffee so sweet I thought I would go into shock. Top tip, order sugar on the side!Or fiend arrived and we ordered. Corn beef hash - bland. Salmon toasty - bland too, truffle fries - very good. Also ordered a bottle of s.blanc. Not bad but pricey. Indeed that sums up the experience
4
To get to Halia, one must stroll along a pathway in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, past a couple of waterfalls and its colorful indigenenous flora. The restaurant provides both indoor and outdoor dining in a lovely setting surrounded by the gardens. We hosted a dinner for eight indoors and were seated next to a small kitchen which gave the impression we were eating at a Chef's table. Cocktails were generally good but the fresh ginger infused drinks took a little getting used to. I ordered the New Zealand Rack of Lamb marinated in Java spice which was papered perfectly rare and was as exotic a lamb as I have ever tasted. Our guests were similarly satisfied with their mains. The hit for me was Halia's Rojak desert which included fresh fruit, berries, an amazing chilli chocolate sauce, chopped peanuts, sesame seeds and nori crisp. It was a perfect ending to a great meal. I would have easily given the restaurant five stars had the service not been so slow on what appeared to be a slow night. If you want a nice, relaxed romantic evening enjoying a fantastic meal in Singapore, I highly recommend Halia'
5
One of the most beautiful settings imaginable, a lovely space seated in the Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanical Garden. The setting is duly matched by the exquisite culinary skill of the chef, serving delectable flavor complements equally matched by the gracious warmth and hospitality of the dining room professionals. I arrived alone walking through the rainy mist into this magical place and left elevated by the multi sensory dining experience and personal kindness expressed by each staff member. I look forward to returning to Halia and hope that each guest arrives with the same grace and kind expectation that this fine restaurant exudes

We've been to Halia for brunch several times. It's a favourite when we have out of town guests visiting Singapore for the first time and who aren't quite adventurous enough to try local food, but want an experience that isn't 'just another restaurant'. We always sit outside. The dining room is usually chilled so much that one would need to wear a parka. The outside dining area is covered from sun and rain, but open at the sides to the gardens almost encroaching onto the tables. Dress code is quite casual, acknowledging that diners might like to walk in the Botanic Gardens before or after their meal. And, of course, it's always hot and sticky walking in the beautful Singapore Botanic Gardens so loose casual clothing is a must.The menu at Halia ranges from light snacks to full meal dishes, with an interesting and eclectic choice of styles and flavours. Service is reasonably good, but it doesn't matter when it's not fantastically quick because it's the chance to sit surrounded by the gardens for a long leisurely chat with friends that is the point.The only irritating point is the refusal to accept reservations for weekend brunch
5
When we desperately needed a beer they hadn't open yet but we got it anyway! We stayed for lunch and it was really worth every dollar. The Australian chef is a gem and the service was excellent. The food had different tastes supporting each other creating a perfect balance to the dishes.Try it - you wouldn't be disappointed
5
My wife and i decised to head down to Halia for our Anniversary Dinner as a walk in guest. The friendly waitress at the door told us gently that there was a table available but there is a reversation at 8pm. My wife and I have no issue with that. We sat down, told them its our Anniversay night. The attentiveness of the waiter there was awesome. Explained and suggested everything in detailed. We ordered Rack of Lamb, pork belly, soup and the special oysters as appetizer. Well cooked and drlicious food. pork belly was a little hard though but still delicious!At the end of the dinner, they provided a complimentary dessert with the words Happy One Tear Anniversary for us. Very thoughtful. We promise we will be back soon. a highly recommended place for dinner or celebration
4
We didn't eat a full meal, mostly starters and dessert. We wanted to sit down and cool off after the orchid garden and process the experience. There wasn't any space available indoors, which actually worked out better for us, after we'd watched things for a while once we sat down. The food was on the pricey side for what it was and we were completely happy with the exchange under the circumstances. The setting is gorgeous and the food was well-presented and interesting; portions were spare for what it was, and they were unstinting with the water and ice! We had some of their special drinks and they were expensive and a fun treat--worth it. Service fine and consistent with prices without being over the top. A lovely, lovely experience. We toured the ginger garden afterwards and that was fun, to
5
My husband's parents were visiting Singapore, and we wanted to choose the right place for it. I suggested Halia because I had been there before with my friends and really loved the food and atmosphere. Yes, I was right! My parents in law were happy that we took them there, because not only the food was good, the service was excellent. We really felt like we were treated special. Would highly recommend others for this. I will definitely come back again
5
This was a highlight of our trip to Singapore. We had dinner seated out doors and it was a truly romantic and peaceful experience which I would highly recommend. We found the service to be very friendly and helpful and people went out of their way for us. After dinner, we then strolled back to our hotel through the gardens and all the trees were lit up with pretty lights! I will always remember our lovely evening spent there and will return again.

My wife and I arrived in Singapore on Monday and had booked a table at Halia for the following lunchtime. We were staying over the causeway in Johor Bahru and had to make the hectic border crossing back to the island to keep the appointment, after a slight delay and a telephone call to the restaurant re-confirming the booking we were shown to our table about 13:15, for the next one hundred and eighty minutes we could have been a million miles away.On offer was a fantastic "express lunchtime menu" at $S 28.00++ but we opted for the Al a Carte selection, after all we might never eat here again. A bottle of Leroy Duval champagne got the meal off to a great start and made a fine accompaniment to our choice of starters. My wife chose ginger infused foie Gras with a green leaf salad, fresh figs and finely cubed apple that was delightful whilst I had hokkaido scallops with a boneless pressed chicken wing that was served with a selection of sweet corn ‚Äútextures‚Äù, a puree, a section cut from the cob, some kernels and a desiccated coating. As a main course Marian selected a 300 day grain fed Black Angus tenderloin steak which to use her words ‚Äúcould have been eaten without teeth‚Äù this was served with saffron mash and wilted spinach. I opted for pan seared duck breast with saut√©ed potatoes, cinnamon compote and baby carrots. Such was the portion size, I can only assume that the duck was related to either Pamela Anderson or Barbra Windsor, possibly both, but it was cooked to perfection. It ws only my wife who could manage a dessert requesting the house dish ‚ÄúHalia‚Äôs Rojak‚Äù consisting of fresh fruits and berries, with a chilli chocolate sauce and ginger flower sorbet. The texture was given an extra dimension with the addition of chopped nuts, nori crisp and sesame seeds.Throughout our dinning experience every course was described and explained in great depth by the extremely knowledgeable waiting staff.The restaurant also offers a recommended wine by the glass with each dish, from its extensive wine list.  This was a truly memorable lunch, not inexpensive, but not overpriced
5
Everything about this restaurant was perfect. The staff were friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was quiet and elegant and the meal - well it was probably the best meal I have ever had out. Every bite is carefully constructed for perfect flavours, and I've never been anywhere quite like it.
3
The Halia Restaurant is situated on the grounds of the Botanic Gardens. I am really surprised by all the rave reviews of this establishment. Service was average. We went for lunch and were so disappointed. Maybe it was an off day but the restaurant is very pricey even for Singapore and while the food quality was good, the taste and quantity were lacking. You will leave hungry
5
If ginger tea with honey takes your fancy, pop in here for breakfast. We arrived before 10am (opening time ) but were warmly welcomed and sat at a shaded table. After a leisurely read and scan of the menu we settled for field mushrooms and poached eggs. The suggestion of starting with a green salad was new to us but we loved the fresh,zingy tastes of apple, orange peel,salad leaves,grapes and walnuts. When the mains arrived, we could not believe the size. We swapped our dishes midway to share and both eggs and mushrooms were cooked to perfection
4
I had dinner at the outside bar last night by myself. It was empty, am guessing because of the four tourist buses idling just next to the bar. The bartender was great- professional, courteous and welcoming. He helped me with the menu and suggested the chili crab. It was a nice dish, but not fantastic- actually needed some chili! I would definitely go back with friends and have dinner inside the restaurant, which was packed. The menu was eclectic and quite interesting, and the prices really good value. And of course, the ambiance of Raffles Hotel is special
4
My partner had Oven-baked Chilean seabass fillet and I had Hiramasa Kingfish. We also had the soup of the day - Jerusalem Artichoke as well as Brown Brothers Sweet Wine which was exclusive to Halia Restaurant.The ambience of outdoor dining was relaxing and enjoyable. Diana made us felt well taken care of during dinner.When she found out that it was my partner's birthday, she offered complimentary Halia Infusion with Himalayan Honey. It was perfect after dinner beverage
5
Amazing night in the garden! We got lost because the taxi cant find the location that is why we have to walk quite far! I find it exciting but my friends dont they find it creepy coz of the poorly lit garden. We were welcomed by a lovely lady who at the same time served us perfectly! This is indeed one of the best spot in Singapore to visit, food was terrific, carpaccio of beef with chips for appetiser, followed by nicely done beef and fondant for our dessert! The lady even arranged a special dessert for my friend due to allergies! Very thoughtful! I will visit the gardens again, really a sanctuary in the busy district of Singapore
5
lovely ambience close to ginger garden and a beautiful spread too. choice of every tea imaginable, a special treat after a wander through the gardens
5
Really enjoyed the interesting food. The Duo Fois Gras was really excellent and hubby enjoyed his sea bass en papillotte. The service was terrific, enjoyed the lovely setting and ambience. Also low key Sunday night jazz was an added bonus.
5
We had a really good meal ... Lovely garden setting and great service - attentive, knowledgable and good humoured.
5
We had lunch here after a delightful morning in the famous botanical gardens of Singapore.The restaurant isn't cheap but neither is it over-priced in terms of the menu choices, the excellent service and the wonderful atmosphere.One of the notable touches here is the recommendations of the wines that might go with the food. We had Barramundi and the wine suggested to compliment it was an Australian riesling. It went perfectly with the meal and was a wine we might never had considered for this food.We've often thought about eating here on our many previous visits to the gardens but were put off because it looked very expensive - it isn't so go for it
3
Grabbed food here while visiting the botanical garden and orchid garden. The food was pretty good, but the main advantage is location. Since this restaurant is in the park, you don't need to leave the gardens to find food. The surroundings are very pleasant (near the ginger garden). However, the price is write expensive, even by Singapore standards. Service was slow, but not annoyingly so. You might want to find food before you arrive
3
One of the most expensive restaurants of Singapore, that I have been to; and the worst part is the food isn't even that great for the price. It is a fine dining, with all the classy experience of service, ambiance, culinary art and the presentation. Food, however, is just average
4
We went here on the recommendation of Lonely Planet and were not disappointed. I had the Green Apple Salad which was outstanding and my wife had the Quiche which she also reported as excellent. We ate here with our kids, 11 and 16, and both liked the food options as well. Our only complaint was that my son ordered from the kids menu and was VERY unhappy that they brought his food on what were basically baby plates. He was very embarrased and upset that they did this. It was a shame this happened because otherwise it was a flawless dining experience. Taking off one star because the staff should know to differentiate older kids from younger ones
5
We chanced upon Halia during a visit to the Botanic Gardens, Too late for lunch, we returned for afternoon tea. At our choice we sat outside and were offered appropriate mosquito protection (you may think there should not be any in a restaurant of this quality, and that would be a fair point, but presumably hard to achieve in a location within the Botanic Gardens). There was limited choice for afternoon tea but we enjoyed a chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, English breakfast tea and still water, with suitable spacing of course. The chocolate cake was a masterpiece, oozing high quality chocolate from every pore. This cake had been lovingly and skilfully put together. Outstanding. And a very generous portion, too. The vanilla ice cream was not quite in the same league, merely very good as opposed to outstanding. The English Breakfast tea suffered from the long life milk that is the norm in these parts. The water, to our surprise, had been imported from Italy. It was perfectly good water but it seemed a little unnecessary to ship it so far. Service was friendly, helpful and accurate throughout. Overall a little expensive at around $50 Singapore dollars for 2 (including service and tax), but a most enjoyable and relaxing hour or so. The menus that we inspected looked well thought out and it was clear that great care had been taken to match the wines to the food. We did not have the opportunity to return for a meal but would not hesitate to do so
5
We had dinner at the Halia in early December to celebrate the wedding of our friends. The natural beauty of the gardens was highlighted by the extra lights for Christmas. Between the four of us we had four different starters, four different mains and two desserts. And each of us believed that we had each made the best meal choice. The food was exquisite - whether it was sea bass, duck, lamb or beef tenderloin. The service was impeccable: attentive, without being disruptive. We would highly recommend Halia for a special occasion. Ask for an outdoor table if you have the choice
4
Lovely spot. Great food at reasonable prices. The freshly baked banana bread is worth the wait and the calories :-)Staff are impeccably polite and do the right thing. When they brought poached eggs with hollandaise all over it unlike on the side order, they volunteered to take it off the bill. Recommended for Sunday brunc
4
Lovely fresh food set in the lush greenery of the botanic gardens. Very small portions unfortunately. Good wine list. Very attentive staff. Highly recommend for brunch after a walk through the gardens and the orchid garden.
4
I loved the clean, fresh cuisine they served. Portion is to be desired though as its small for the price charged. Lovely ambience! Goes with the whole ¬¥in the garden¬¥theme.

When we last visited this restaurant in October we were impressed (see relevant review). At the time we had given thought of trying brunch and finally we made it. It was once again a fantastic experience. The ambience is wonderful; even if different from night, it retains the charm, charisma and uniqueness of being surrounded by these great plants and vegetation.The food was outstanding, We can't fault it or pick on it in any way. The service was superb as when we went for dinner. If you want to spoil yourself or impress somebody for whatever reason, this is the perfect place. You can choose indoor or (strongly recommended) outdoors. We will surely visit this place many more times.Note: for brunch they don't take bookings

Attracted by the tantalizing brunch pictures on its website, it was slightly disappointing to find out that the trout salmon fillet(not the usual smoke salmon version) topped with poached egg and that velvety hollandaise sauce is no longer available. So we shared a couple of other brunch dishes.For more info: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/11/halia-gingerhouse.htmlCaramelised banana walnut bread, vanilla mascarpone cream, kumquat compote and crushed hazelnuts: This requires 20minutes of waiting time but the taste of the bread (more like a light cake) was warm, moist and fresh so I think the wait is reasonable. The bananas were grilled nicely to give a subtle bitter caramelised flavour. The bread itself is choke full of walnuts which some people who dislike nuts may want to avoid but I guess having some walnuts are still beneficial to the brainThe AmericanLike the previous one, the portion is good for sharing. Nothing spectacular but perhaps the only slight flaw is the overcooked poached egg. Not only was the egg yolk fully cooked, the egg white had a sharp tang of white vinegar. warm chocolate pudding white choc sauce(if you can spot) crushed pistachio orange flower ice creamIt was strange that they served an ice cream on a hot plate even though the chocolate pudding was supposed to be warm. The ice cream melted rapidly. This pudding is the steamed English version of fa kueh so perhaps the menu should have stated whether it is the creamy custard version or a cake version. The white chocolate sauce is also evidently very very little.Young ginger Nougat frozen parfait with roasted pineapple and spiced pineapple sauceNougat is not something common on a restaurant's menu and this one is worth trying since it has been the longest running dessert on it's menu according to the waiter. The use of coconut, ginger and pineapple highlights the Asian flavour and it's no wonder a hit especially for tourists.Special brunch item: almond orange cake with citrus sherbet and lemongrass panna cotta Another interesting Asian style dessert whose individual components are well balanced. Sour food lovers will certainly like the tangy sherbet. Service was friendly but the attentiveness can be improved. Nonetheless, it may be a decent dining place to go if you are looking for one that is located in a garden

Was viewing the place for a wedding reception today. The sales person was not available and we were being brought about by a person who did not know anything and was not able to properly introduce the place. It started raining so we went to the restaurant area to have some drinks and talk about the wedding.Upon entering the air-conditioned area of the restaurant, a waitress approached us and asked us to sit at the long table when there were 6 of us (with a kid), facing the wall! There was a table of 4 available but she insisted we sit at the long table facing the glass wall. I asked her why when the table was available and she said that as we were not eating, we should not sit at the table since there would be other customers who might be eating a meal!This is downright rude behaviour, does it mean that when patrons come in, they must have a meal else we are treated as "lower class"? She did not even bother to ask us whether we were eating a meal when she did that! I never felt so humilated! I told her we were eating and she said, you did not say so! Finally after insisting, she put us at the table but when i asked for water, she demanded to know whether it was mineral water - still or sparking! I think she did it deliberately so that I was say what is it?? Guess she was disappointed when I said sparking! I definately saw that they serve tap water but she did not offer that option to us!This is really lousy service! I suggest that other customers should not go there unless you are caucasion since this Philippino waitress treated them like royalty (at the table next to us) but the locals were treated as sub-standard people
4
The restaurant is located in the ginger gardens of the Botanical Gardens. It is a great place to take a break from enjoying all the beautiful flowers (the orchid garden is right next door). The lunch menu is a la carte or a 2 or 3-course meal. While they don't have much in the salad department, they do have nice appetizers and entrees including a barramundi dish that is outstanding. They also have a nice wine list. Like everything else in Singapore, this is not a cheap place to eat--around Sin$28 for a 2 course lunch without alcohol.
5
While walking around the Botanical Gardens we got a little hungry so we stopped in for lunch at this cozy little restaurant in the middel of the gardens. WOW, what a suprise. Even though the portions were small, the food was excellent along with the presentation. The service was excellent and we would recommend this as one of the have to eat at restaurants in Singapore.
5
I started my day roaming around Botanic Gardens and i came across a restaurant called Halia located just next to the Ginger Gardens and Orchid gardens. The view is beautiful so i decided to have my lunch there. i was seated in the outdoor dining area. The service was prompt and friendly. I had the soup for a starter and Salmon for my main course. I also had wine paring as recommended by the charming young server Faiza who never fail to stop smiling and entertained me through out my meal . i then finished my meal with the steamed chocolate pudding for dessert. The taste was exactly how Faiza described ! Mouth watering ! I had a sumptuous lunch. Thank you to Halia and its asset waiter

Halia in Botanic Garden serves wonderful food in a breath-taking environment. But what top it is the excellent service.We made the booking at 8:30, but we were over an hour late due to famous taxi saga in Singapore and we were lost in the Botanical Garden (dark with minimal direction). We got there and the whole place was empty (it would be close to 10pm). We walked in and asked if they still serve, our server Michael said 'we are open as long as you are here'. He took us through the recommendation in wine, appetizers, main courses and desserts with patience. Throughout the entire dinner, not even a sign of rushing. The service of the restaurant set it apart from other great dinning experience. So even he forgot to give us napkin until we reminded him, it's still a 5 stars place for us. When we finished it was 12 midnight, the garden was so dark we could hardly see our way. Michael took his ipad to light the path so we could walk out of the garden to main road to get a cab. It's a 4 star restaurant but Michael earned an extra star for it
4
We have visited Singapore several times and always intended on having a fancy dinner out so we finally booked a table at Halia. First tip is to make sure you know which entrance to the botanical gardens is best as we ended up walking for a while! When we got there we chose to sit inside and were the only people in there. We had fantastic service from two young men and the food was fantastic, yes the portions are fairly small but they are fantastic, the dessert was to die for and the quality of the food was amazing. It ended up costing a fair bit but it was worth it for a perfect romantic night to celebrate our engagement
5
A wonderful location in the Botanic Gardens. Very peaceful. The food and service was excelllent, although rather pricey if you eat in the 'restaurant garden.' Every other Sunday they have a jazz evening during dinner, which is wonderful. Definitely worth a visit.
5
The food and service was brilliant. We sat in the outside part of the restaurant surrounded by plants - so peaceful and the young man who served us did an amazing job.
5
Every experience is individual and unique. However the atmosphere here is spectacular and the service excellent. The food was also great, and the experience overall was one of a kind. We will definitely visit this place many times.
5
Visited last week to celebrate an anniversary. The setting amongst the Botanical Gardens was beautiful and the food and service was excellent though rather pricey. Enjoyed the evening and would definitely return for a special occasion.
3
Went to Halia last Sunday night for the Jazz evening. The setting of the restaurant is beautiful, the music was very good..but the food is a different story. Although I had no problem with the quality of the food, the portion sizes are so small, that we all went home hungry. As the prices are not small this was not acceptable. With mains around the $45-$50++ range, one would expect to at least leave with a full tummy. A perfect example was the single, tiny, baby carrot served on my dish. Really???? I would like to return to Halia, but won't be doing so until the portion sizes are of a reasonable size
3
I went to Halia for dinner this week with a friend. The location is wonderful, walkin through the gardens, around the lake and the sounds & smells of the vegetation percolated through Halia.The menu was pretty small, one of those menus where you're picking what do have based on what you don't want rather than agonising between choices.We ordered some cocktails (very tasty) I had lamb and my friend fish. That, plus a bottle of wine, the cocktails and 2 desserts brought our bill to over $300.Nice evening but not $300 worth of nic
5
Despite the fact that I have written one comment for Halia already, I would like to add a few lines after my recent visit (and I can assure that I have no personal links to this restaurant !)I do not want to add another statement about the great food, the creativity of the chef, the nice setting of this place; I will not write about the flexibility of the kitchen when you have food allergy; this time I will focus on the staff of Halia. Our host was again Riduan and he is an example of how I want to be treated as customer. He combines friendliness and extensive knowledge about food and wine with a good sense of humor. He leads a team that does its work in an efficient and polite manner ‚Äì available when you need them and otherwise ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù in the background. We have been treated exceptionally with a fruity-sweet surprise at the end ‚Äì it was another wonderful experience at Halia
5
I came out of the National Orchid Garden, looking for something to drink and saw the Halia Restaurant. The menu looked so appealing that instead going for just a drink ... I went in for a lunch :-)Sat outside, beautiful atmosphere amid the gardens and the service was really great! Of course the essential is the food and that was awesome! Decided to spoil myself, skipped the set lunch menu and went for "√† la carte" : a trio of seasonal oysters, followed by duo de foie gras ... and it was simply succulent!! OK ... it comes with a price tag but it was definitely worth it and in the end of the day, everything is expensive in Singapore so better make sure you get the best quality!Would definitely go back :-
2
I returned here after a previous visit to give it another try. This time myself and two friends went for the lunch set menu. While the quality of the food was good, the portion size ensures that you leave hungry. The most amusing part of it was the amount of mashed potatoes, which was decoratively swirled around the plate but it was simply a minute size. While it may appear to be good value, when you consider how small and unsatisfying the portion size is, it is not. It's a great location. I would try it once more, third time lucky but don't hold high hopes. We also filled in the comment card but never heard from them. What's the point in having comment cards if the comments aren't acted upon? They probably get a lot of tourist passing trade, so unlikely that anything will change here
4
Amazing setting in the middle of Botanic Gardens. We went for the Jazz night (last Sunday of the month), the music was very good and the environment perfect for a romantic evening out with my wife. Food is very good although I find it sligthly over-sold with all the fancy descriptions for food which is good, but not really gourmet quality.All in all a very enjoyable evening
5
This place led to us measuring all other restaurants by its high standard. From a warm welcome to excellent food . Extras included local honey and ginger tea . Being asked if they could use our names and remembering these throughout the night .

The place was nice and staff were polite but it was prohibitively expensive.
Food was average relative to the price they were charging for it.

There is not much to say except excellent serve and mouthwatering food. Dining here was the best experience I had in singapore. The atmosphere, the ambiance, the service and the food was beyond excellent. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed :).

Halia is an excellent restaurant, situated in the beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens.It's a delightful place to have lunch when you're visiting the Botanic Gardens.You can sit inside or outside.The food and service is excellent. Try the weekday lunch specials: SGD 28 for 2 courses or SGD 32 for 3 courses.Besides the specials, there are superb dishes on the a la carte menue, including foie gras and Maine lobster- beautifully prepared.Highly recommended

i guess not may people know that there are some good restaurants in the middle of botanic garden. one of the good restaurant is Halia. my family and i had halia for a birthday dinner. we shared the appetisers like foie gras duo, and i'm a fans of foie gras, baked hokkaido scallops and also a risoto, that forgot the name. they made the foie gras with two types of cooking. one of the foie gras was like terinne and served with biscotti, and the other one with a little bit pan seared with some ripe tomato sauce. both were amaizing, the terine one was not so mussy and it was just perfect. the scallop was also perfect not too salty and very tender and it was served with some crunchy pastrry to add some layers. the part that i like is the risoto. usually risotto made by special risotto rice, but in Halia it is made from like such a bean sprout. it was combined with fresh oyster.for main i took grilled maine lobster with truffle and hollandise gratin. it was amazing!!! the lobster was cooked perfectly and the truffle made the dish unbeatable. i also tried wagyu with a thick sauce. the meat was cooked perfectly but the sauce is just to heavy for me. i like a light and foamy sauce.and come of my favourite part, DESSERT. we had some dessert and shared it. the dessert that i like the most is the eadible garden. it was made by some eadible flower and an ice cream and combined it with lychee shoot. it was perfect.The service was just perfect. it was worth every penny

Having been to Halia a couple of years ago, we decided to have Sunday brunch again, this time with stroller in tow! The restaurant isn't completely stroller friendly, but the helpful staff got us to our outdoor table with minimum fuss. This was only the start of the excellent service we received throughout our visit. Our server for the day as Michael, and he set a high service standard from the first greeting. A standard that was followed by the other staff that attended to us. We were impressed, not expecting service levels usually found in fine dining establishments, in such a casual environment. Dining al fresco would fit the ambience better than the air conditioned area. But better to leave it to the cooler hours of the day, as it can get really humid. The food was good but perhaps we could expect a little bit more for this price range (truffle fries with that wagyu burger perhaps). Overall it was an experience we would gladly repeat and will look forward to Halia again on our next visit to the Botanic Gardens

Perfect combination of great food and service in a dreamy lush garden setting.Was drawn and charmed by their big brunch menu one fine Saturday afternoon and decided to drop by the very next day after learning of their live Jazz band on Sunday evenings. We were indeed mesmerized by it all and it was what one would call; a faultless experience. We chose to seat at the breezy and intimate outdoor terrace - marvellous ambiance. Imagine "dining high-end amidst the dense jungle". Great beverage list. Food: top picks (all that we both had to share!) were the foie gras duo, oysters trio, rack of lamb and wagyu rump cap. Nicely complimented by the wine-pairing recommendations on the menu for every dish (smart!). Was coaxed by our lovely host to end the meal with a dessert...now we explained that we do not have a sweet tooth and was recommended the fig tart with bacon pear ice cream. Voila,ended the meal on an excellent sweet savoury note. I agree that their Signature vietnamese Halia (ginger) infusion was a great natural "digestif". Keep it up and we already are planning our next visit!

It was my second time at Halia -I had lunch there in February and this time it was dinner.Both meals were excellent and unforgettable ,and the atmosphere was great.The staff were wonderful,too esp Riduan,who was so articulate about the menu!My main dish was the oven-baked sea bass wrapped in paper -it was so good!Would love to go back again
5
My husband, myself and my 4year old son dined on 4th Aug to celebrate my birthday in advance. Starter we had foie gras and the prawn.... and with the white wine recommended by Mr Riduan. They really go well together. We loved the food, esp the lamb and the tenderloin. Purrrrrrrfect with the red wine recommended by Mr Riduan too. He has great knowledge regarding food + wine, his service is absolutely excellent...There is absolutely no worries in what to order for my son, he has fish and chips. (the serving is huge for a 4 year old!! ) And the soup of the day was mushroom soup, which is my son's all time fav. For my "birthday cake" it was a fruit platter beautifully created by The Halia Team. Thank you all for making my night so memorable one. We will definitely vist The Halia again. Highly recommended for those who love wine and food. And yes... the pipe in music was jazzy , good ambience and overall... food+wine+ambience+service 5 stars. Thumbs up guys

I like high tea mainly due to I love the dessert and pastry. I did an online google and found the review for Halia was overall good, and it is located inside botanical garden. I am thinking high tea in garden, that will be very nice. So decided to give it a try. Their high tea only availavle on Saturday, Sunday & Public Holiday, from 3pm to 5pm.Halia doesn't take reservations for afternoon tea. However, it is not very crowded when we arrive. Due to the warm weather most of the visitor choose to seat inside the air-corn room. You may refer to their website for more information on high tea session.Dated my sister and friend, we reached Halia on a Sunday afternoon. I like the environment & ambiance, tea house in greeny. The high-tea set is around $28++ per person, and we ordered 2 sets and one extra drink and shared among 3 of us. It is indeed quite expensive, with some top up you may enjoy high tea buffet at some other place.It comes in a two-tiered stand and you may see the cake and pastry serves as below. The cake and pastry are nice. That actually made us feel like the money we paid is worth for the environment and food

Great food & service. Would sit outside next time- looks a little more fun.
5
Magnificent food and good value lunch menu. Worth a visit when you are in the gardens.
5
Had a fantastic meal here. The food was divine and the service attentive. Of the mains the sea bass and the king fish were the most popular. We sat outside, amidst the garden, which was lovely. It was pricey but we had a great night.
5
Whilst on several stays in the city Halia was always one of my favourite eateries. Whether for lunch and cocktails, High Tea or the open dining experience in the evening. The food is divine and the staff are excellent. The open area is much better than the air conditioned restaurant. You feel close to nature with the trees and plants all around. If you are ever lucky enough to visit Singapore take a trip to The Botanical gardens and give Halia a try

My girlfriend surprised me with a meal at Halia this week: she told me it would be a surprise and I was kind expecting a picnic or something as we were in the Botanical Gardnes, but was getting dark and we walked into Halia.Fantastic ambience, seat by the window, some cocktails and appetisers and perused the menu for mains. I ordered duck and my girlfriend fish and a nicve bottle of red (chilled in Singapore style) and we tucked in. Great flavours, nicely presented.Great service - not too fast and not too pushy. We skipped dessert and went for a moonlit stroll in the gardens. A bit expensive but I feel was worth it
5
Upon recommendation of relatives I decided to book a table for two. Since I made the reservation just 1 hour before, they were not able to give give me indoor seats. The outdoor seat however is just perfect.We were greeted by the staff and all of them were very friendly and professional. The waiter was able to explain each of the dishes vividly and was also able to recommened on what appetizer goes well with what main course.The dishes were presented very nicely and the food ofcouse were perfectly prepared. Well done!The combination of location (situated in the Botanic Garden), food, ambience, and service make this a highly recommended restaurant
5
Cousins and I spent our Saturday afternoon at Halia Restaurant, Botanic Garden Singapore. Located within the Botanic Garden, the restaurant is surrounded by green lush plants, a perfect escape from the tall concrete buildings in the City. The restaurant has indoor as well as outdoor seating area, we op to have al fresco afternoon tea. We are welcomed by friendly staff. Ordering is very easy with help from very knowledgeable staff! Service is prompt. The staff even explain the food to us when our tea set is served! We enjoyed the afternoon tea with no rush and the noise level @ outdoor seating area is very minimal* i guess this is variable , depending on the guests at that time. Overall we had a perfect afternoon tea. Note: Tea is served in presser , not in tea pot
3
its a lovely looking restaurant and tyhe location in the middle of the botanical gardens is really lovely , i dashed in here as the heavens had opened and i thought id have lunch whilst i waited for the rain to stop. a rusher bruque indian waitrose told me i couldnt have a table and had to sit around the edges of the restaurant along a bench as i was a "single " diner. I get there point as it did get busy later but it wasnt phrased very diplomatically . i then chose the set three course lunch menu which was very good value. where they sting you is on the wine i had a glass of sauvignon and a desert wine and it doubles my bill . i did think it odd that said same waitress insisted that i choose my desert when she took my food order, normally you'd do that after you've eaten your main course. i got the impression they wanted to rush you through and get you in and out tomake room for someone else. she was just a bit agressive in her manner, and totally unsmiley. she somewhat marred my dining experience which could have been lovely as the food was beautifully presented and very flavoursome. All i can say is sort out the staff training ... a course in customer care and how to smile wouldnt go astray

Friends took us out to this restaurant and it was absolutely amazing. Now our favorite restaurant in Singapore. The staff knows the menu really well and are very informative. The fusion flavors make eating a dream. We tried the oysters, the foie gras, the sea bass, the pork, and the seared tuna. Everything was divine. The flavor combinations were original and delicious. All dishes have a proposed wine pairing, but we chose our own wines and were quite happy. This is a pricey restaurant, but well worth it! We hope to go back again and again.
5
...next to the Ginger Garden of the Botanical Garden. Our choice of seared tuna with herb rub, pink peppercorn, mango salsa and mesclun salad in green lime vinaigrette gave an exquisite combination of flavours. This refreshing lunch finished with a dessert of ginger frozen nougat parfait and roasted pineapple. Aim to go between 12 and 2 pm for the best value, their set lunch
5
We only stopped here for a drink whilst walking in the Botanic gardens. The drinks were beautifully presented, quite pricey but the service was brilliant, even down to giving us shower capes to continue with the rest of our walk.
4
Great location attentive knowledgeable staff. Fantastic interesting menu. Lovely
5
The food here was really good and the wine was lovely. It is a bit pricey, but after walking for a few hours in the heat visiting the fabulous orchid gardens, this is a perfect way to end the day.
5
A unique place to have dinner in Singapore, located in the Botanical Gardens. Food & service are just great, each menu item has a wine recommendation, a nice touch. Option to dine both inside and outside, outside is the way to go. Perfect setting for a romantic dinner or dine with biz relations or visitors to the City. Only a 5 - 10 min taxi ride from the city center. No smoking
4
Food and setting are great. It's in the middle of the botanic garden, however always had the feeling that the staff was not satisfied with our choices. She even said I had to choose the dessert at the beginning, because portions are very small... weird atmosphere, just totally unnecessary... but i would def go back
3
Peaceful and quiet in the middle of the gardens. Could be quite a walk before you can reach it but just at the right moment for you to rest your tired feet. Had afternoon tea there. Food wasn't superb but one is too tired to really mind
3
We had breakfast there. The menu was eclectic and substantial enough. The presentation was thought out and well executed. The service was very attentive and polite. The atmosphere was a healthy combination of city-smart and park-friendly...linen cloths without the pretense.The food was not particularly memorable, though the quality of the ingredients was high. The bread basket did, however, stand out. The sweet breads were fantastic! It seemed a bit short on flavor otherwise and better suited for a more mild palate than my own. Mine is an American palate so take that with a grain of salt. I prefer more sweet and more spice.All of this said, if you're looking for a dine out "experience," and not just great food, I do recommend Halia Restaurant. It's a great place to spend some time dining with friends or family
5
On a visit to the botanical gardens we decided to lunch at Hania. We did not have a reservation and were lucky to get a table as it was busy. We opted to order starters as we were to have a large dinner and I tried the Oyster combination which was unique and delicious. The wine list is very good and sipping an ice cold Savignon Blanc on a hot and humid day in a maginificent garden is a great way to enjoy life! Pricey but worth the experience
4
My hubby and I love Halia because of the location. This restaurant is neatly tucked away in a corner of the botanical gardens which allows for a very romantic and peaceful setting, amongst the tropical flowers. The menu is definitely creative and can sometimes be hit or miss. Luckily, we‚Äôve experienced mainly ‚Äúhits‚Äù. This is more of a refined restaurant (at least during dinner) which equates into small portions and on the expensive side. The service ranges from OK to outstanding depending on your waiter for the night. In summary, I imagine we will continue to patronize Halia for special occasions because we love the location and the food is above average
5
It was amazing experience at the heart of Botanic garden Singapore, next to waterfall, the restaurant is hidden in this richness of the green trees. The service was unbelievable, not annoying as at some restaurants it can be, but just at the right time, at the right place. The washroom was shown and taken practically to the door, even we got accompanied to the taxi stand. It was really unsual. The 3 course meal was very tasty but you have to deal with small quantities of the dishes. The prices of the meals are more at a high end. But for some special occasions it is really worth it
5
We wandered in here for our Christmas lunch. The staff were very friendly, the food was superb and it was in an excellent location in the middle of the Botanic Gardens.
2
I was there for their lunch set. Prices were reasonable. The food isn't too bad. A little on the over seasoned side of things (could do with less salt) and found it strange that they would serve you butter but then proceed to ask if you'd like to purchase the bread. Otherwise they would remove the butter. Very odd. I would rather they price it in and not ask during the start of the meal. It was a strange experience to say the least. This is the first having dined around the world. The bread wasn't anything special.Great location and setting however the wait service needs a lot more training. They were friendly but seemed a little brash. It is still falling short when compared to similar dinning places in Singapore and especially around the world. Wait staff are amateur at most, slow and reactive in service, had to be called for refills, told to remove extra table settings, just an overall mis-timed such as asking how the food was. Yes, they did ask how the food was but 1 min into the meal was too soon and seeing a conversation going on was interruptive. It is a pity because, the dinning experience would easily have been a lot better had the service been up to par with the level of sophistication the setting provided. I hope this will improve, hope they will provide better training for their staff. They did have a good bye greet which was nice

Halia is known amongst gourmets for its lovely location and its great food. This is something you could expect from a high-class restaurant. But Halia is more than that. If you have an allergy, if you have any food-restrictions, if you want the chef to adjust a dish since you do not like certain ingredients or vegetables etc, go to this restaurant. There is no other restaurant I am aware of in Singapore where waiters and chefs are that knowledgable in this respect. Furthermore we are always impressed by the friendliness, by the great sense of humour and the customer-mindset of the hosts of Halia. It will certainly not be the last visit at this restaurant...
5
This restaurant is in the beautiful botanical gardens of Singapore. Our first visit was about a year ago and we just made our second trip for my birthday. The setting is relaxed sitting outside under a covered terrace. All the staff look after you superbly and all remember your name for the entire stay. The food of course is not for those that like huge portions on their plate, but for those who like something a little more sophisticated. There is a wonderful beverages list which caters to all. Hopefully we will have a chance to visit again sometime
3
Agree that the lunch menu is much better value and service staff tries hard.To have an Asian name and not provide local delights (which they used to ) does not make sense to me however. During my last visit 6 months ago, my colleague ordered the lamb rack. It was cold and raw on the inside. When it was sent back to be improved, the plate returned with one rib charred and the other still cold and raw on the inside. Why we keep going back is simply because of the location, to dine amidst a garden with fresh air
3
This was my second visit, with 3 years gap in between and my memories were shattered by a very average dining experience. And a word of warning, Halia is not cheap ($SGD86 for small steak) and so my expectations were high. What's good: great setting in the Botanical Gardens, attentive and polite service, good list of cocktails to choose from... unfortunately overshadowed by a tough steak, not cooked to order. Think I will pass on my next invitation
3
The setting for Halia is great - it is in the botanical gardens, so it has a great view and is family-friendly. However, we went to Halia for Christmas Day Brunch and the food was disappointing. The Live Station (Turkey, etc) was disappointing because the meat was quite dry and there wasn't any stuffing or gravy provided. The vegetables including the potatoes were undercooked. It wasn't the style, it was that the potatoes were hard and crunchy, and not in a good way. There was also an issue with ants crawling over the food in one section of the buffet, which was addressed eventually. The free flow option was good value and the wines were good. The staff were friendly. With restaurants though, if you can't get the food right, then you're in trouble. Perhaps it was the number of people and the style (buffet) which was the problem, but I wont go rushing back there for a buffet anytime soon, although I would be willing to give it's a la carte option a go. This is probably more a flag to check the details of the buffets and when catering for large numbers, which isn't necessarily included on the menu that is available
4
Ate with another couple of friends. Service was food, but the food was average for the price. The size of the portions were also very small. Our bill was $900 for 4 people including 2 bottles of averaged priced wine. The location however is fire class and very pleasant but I feel there is better value fine dining in Singapore
4
My girlfriends and I started our day roaming around the Botanic Gardens. After we worked up an appetite we found reviews (via smartphone) and decided Halia is worth a try. Located near the Ginger Gardens and Orchid gardens the view is beautiful. We were seated in the outdoor dining area. We could feel the fans overhead as well as a nice breeze through the trees. The service was prompt and friendly, explaining the set specials and their new holiday cocktail menu. I had the Fois Gras appetizer and Salmon with pesto mash and tomato salad for my main course. I also splurged for the wine paired with the salmon. Then finished with the ginger creme brule. My friend ordered the Ginger ice cream which was a much better choice!The price point is a little higher compared to other options within the Gardens but you won't be disappointed with Halia. Everything was right on par
4
I've been to the Halia several times for lunch and dinner. Lunch is $28 ++ for two courses and $32 with dessert thrown in. The waitresses and waiters strive to please. The ambience is great on a cloudy cool day as the Botanic Gardens form a serene backdrop. Good value if its not a hot day.Dinner is pricey and while the mood is nice, I think one could get a better deal elsewhere unless one enjoys an after dinner walk in the beautiful gardens
5
Went for high tea. Its $29++ which I thought was great value, particularly compared to other high teas on the island. Beautifully presented, they had this chocolate mousse-cake which was to die for. Great service and atmosphere!
5
This is a great place to eat. The service is first class and the food lives up to expectations. The week day set lunch is particularly good value. I had an Island Cooler Mocktail which was very refreshing.
5
great atmosphere
the food was good
unique mixture of coffee
and the service is something you can't describe
4
This unplanned lunch turned out to be a very pleasant one. As the main restaurant at the entrance of the Botanic Garden is always crowded and unorganized at lunch times on weekends, we opted to check out Halila. The setting is peaceful and quiet and the service and food surprisingly good. Prompt and friendly service, very attentive towards kids, good portions (especially for kids menu and for desserts) and high quality of food. At the end of our lunch, it started to rain very heavily and while we were still thinking of what to do, a waiter presented us with rain coats for each and every person on the table. Its more expensive, yet we found the value much better. Our new regular spot in the Botanic Garden
5
When friends visit from out of Singapore, this is where we take them. This is also a favorite for special events with the family, such as birthdays. Great environment but not too formal. For some reason our children always behave here; maybe there are enough distractions with the surrounding forest (we always eat outside). The food is good if not showy. Steaks are good. Not much of a children's menu, our kids usually have spaghetti or steak. There is a ginger cocktail, I don't remember the name, that is excellent. The service ranges from OK to outstanding, depending on the luck of who is working that night.For special dinners with just my wife and me, we go elsewhere (our current favorite is the Cliff). But with families, we choose Halia
5
This is my 2nd review and a great deal has changed ever since my last visit. Renovations completed and a newly overhauled menu by a new chef. The indoor now boasts comfortable sleep-worthy full leather arm chairs,new tables and a show kitchen.The whole airconditioned room smelled like chocolate at one point of time as the pastry chef was baking his creations. My partner and I first had our aperitifs at the new counter table overlooking the lush foliage seating outdoor where the new full bar is,before we adjourned for our dinner indoor.Cocktails with ginger (halia means ginger by the way) were out of the world and the new food menu with wine reccomendations was even mind blowing. My top picks are the salmon and hiramasa kingfish topped with oscietra caviar ($80/++) (ap'tiser) and Blackmore wagyu rump with saffron mash and edamame ($82/++) (main). The soja risotto with truffles,mascoporne and poached oysters ($42/++) is light and very refreshing (side). We declined desserts as we were stuffed but the captain presented a light ginger nougat parfait with glazed pineapple which was beautifully plated with chocolate sauce,"Happy 3rd Anniversary Ryan and Nitty". It was complimentary and we didn't even expect this as my missus casually told the captain of the occasion while they were exchanging conversation when I was in the gents. Need I say more about the service? Michelin-stars worthy. Go
5
Lush tropical surrounds - the sound of the forest cooling breezes Raffles style ambience , outstanding food very skilled staff with great people skills, great wine list at fair value prices -Singapore wine prices are never cheap - this is a great night time restaurant . Take a special person and spoil ech othe
5
Scenic lush setting for the restaurant.. surrounded by green and bright foliage.. open air tables are also available.. extremely courteous staff.. And if they say 15 mins for a dish they deliver it in less than 15 minutes. Yes, the dishes are pricey but it is gourmet and done to perfection. As I am not a fan of European dishes, I went in to the restaurant only for a quick caffeine fix and dessert but was pleasantly surprised by the service .. Please let this place be a secret atleast until our next visit :
5
I took my colleague to Halia Restaurant for a lunch catch up. This is not my first time to visit this restaurant. I must say "What a surprise!" Not only nice weather, "Cloudy" we had a table outdoor and it was perfect. It seems everyone from the restaurant is serving us. "unusual in Singapore". I was pleasantly surprised... We ordered 2 course lunch and no wine. the bill came in around $98 which is not bad for the location and food. My seafood skewer was amazing with couscous. very nice! We completed it with a skim milk latte. Great place to relax for lunch.Will bring my wife next time
2
Halia has several things going for it. A green breezy location, warm wooden decor, plenty of staff to wait on tables, and a menu creative enough to whet the appetite. It is however, let down by the quality of its food. Specifically, on the day we brunched there, the yolk of our poached eggs didn't ooze (i.e. the eggs were overcooked), the hollandaise sauce was bland and viscous, and the bread was soggy. The chef's special - a steak on a paella bed - was unevenly cooked, the steak was mostly fat and little meat, and the paella bed, cold! Despite the number of staff wondering around the restaurant, it was a battle to get their attention and consequently, be served.Unless major changes can be made to the food and service, not an experience I'd like to relive
5
All dishes and drinks are nice and they never fell short of my expectations.
For some sundays, you can enjoy live-jazz band session in the middle of the garden greens.
They have afternoon tea time also.
1
I went there for a lunch with a group of friends; we frequented the place in the past because of the good location and it used to have a good no-nonsense menu. Obviously this has changed over the past year or so as I was presented with a bill of 300 Singapore dollar (~170 euro) for a 300 gram rib-eye!! I never had to pay so much for a piece of meat and this is in a three star restaurant, not exactly the place where you would expect such a royal rib-eye. Unfortunately, it is only when I got the bill that we realized this was a special rib-eye; we had not noticed while tasting it! When confronted, the manager justified the price because it was flown in from Australia - which is true for all Australian beef that is served in most restaurants in Singapore with prices typically between 30-60 dollar.It was a visit we will not forget any time soon; a real rib-off, be warned
5
Halia offers very elegant and idyllic setting,it's impossible for one to bring their troubles into this fine eatery,where it's top-notch service and fine European dishes are second to none in the nation.Im fairly surprised to see negative reviews,hence I wonder if they actually went to the right restaurant,considering it's one of Singapore's best kept secret. Keep it up guys 
3
I had been looking forward to Halia as I love the Botanic Gardens.BTW, the gardens are all non-smoking so no stepping out of the restaurant for a quick smoke. We were greeted warmly but then the upselling started. We were asked if we wanted some Moet champagne. Actually we usually order champagne but I hate someone trying to sell me supermarket quality products. Then he proposed prosecco to my partner and I ordered a gin/tonic. Then he asked me if I wanted Bombay Saphire. Again I said regular gin is fine. By this point I had made it clear I was very pleased with this but he continued by asking if we wanted bottled water. We don't drink bottle water so I asked for regular water. Finally the order. We ordered an escargot mouse and seared foie gras with fig, followed by a vegetable and gorgonzolla risotto and grilled lamb. The menu had pairings for all the dishes so we decided to go with the restaurant's choices. After I ordered, he said why don't you have abottle of wine. Unbelievable, we had ordered the restaurant's own choices which I pointed out to him. Thankfully he disappeared for the rest of the evening.From then we had a pleasant evening and the young wine steward who had just returned from a 2 week trip to wineries in Australia was charming and knowledgeable. For dessert I had a fig tarte with bacon ice cream-the only really memorable food of the evening. The total was $387.00 before tip. This place is incredibly mediocre. I just hope someone has the sense to headhunt the young wine stewar

The walk leading upto the restaurant, if you chose the "long walk", will ensure two things: one you enjoy the scenic beauty of the botanical gardens. And you have enough calories burnt to get ready to burn a hole in your pocket for the upcoming meal.But jokes apart, here's the real deal. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. IMHO the outdoor seating has a 360 degree scenic view. The menu has a combination of the main course along with the wine options which would be best suited with it. The food is quite sumptuous and the deserts are out of this world. I don't really have a huge sweet tooth and me saying such means that the dessert is not "Just Desserts". So make sure that you don't overdo your main course. The fish is what you should stick to for the main course, snapper or salmon are two of my standing favorites.This is a place for fine wine and dining. Depending on your choice of the dishes, it can range from delicious to downright mouth watering
3
I've been here several times. The setting is very nice, but the food is average, and definitely not worth the price. I ordered the focaccia with tandoori chicken and mango. It was fine, but was delivered in something resembling a burger bun - S$20. My fiancee had a Mexican seefood wrap with natios and dip - S$24, again average tastewise.Service in Singapore in just about every restaurant I have been to has been crap, yet they still charge for service. Most waiters here at Halia do their job well, though the one we had messed up the drinks order so we sat waiting til she sorted it out. No apology when I raised this with her.1 mocktail, 1 glass of Tiger, the focaccia and the mexican wrap = S$75.00. Clearly not worth it.Overall, it's a good place to eat if you are hungry after coming out of the Orchid Garden, but I would try the dining area near the exit for something more reasonable value
5
Halia is a hidden gem in the Singapore Botanic Garden.There are two restaurants- opposite each other in the Botanic Garden (Halia Restaurant and Villa Halia).Both offer excellent and well priced food, with pleasant service.There are a broad range of dishes on the menu, which would be likely to cater for a variety of tastes. There is a blending of Asian and Western dishes.The setting in the Botanic Garden is superb and relaxing.This is a great place for a leisurely lunch with friends
3
We visited the place for Sunday blunch.We ate an open sandwitch, the taste was good, and the atmosphere was pleasant.But SGD25 for a small open sandwitch, SGD7 for a small glass of juice (it was obviously from a paper-packed juice anyone can buy at a super market!), etc., were, we think, very much overpriced.If you don't mind their prices, it's an OK place
1
I was excited and looked forward to have an afternoon tea in such a beautiful place. It hurts to say that the service was real bad. The waiter was barely able to speak English and it got worse when he tried to explain the Halia tea specialty. When taking our order, he has this " I could care less" attitude and rushed us while we were contemplating which tea to order to compliment our afternoon tea.I decided to try the Halia tea and it would have been an excellent tea if the water was hot enough for the ginger to properly infused. My tea was bland and all I could taste was the honey. When I explained this to the waiter he said sure, paid for another order and you will get more ginger !!!!I would definitely return to the Botanical garden for they have done a wonderful job in beautifying Singapore but there would be no way I would go for the afternoon tea in Halia. The food was only mediocre. I supposed you are only paying for the environment which could be free by having a picnic in one of the many beautifully manicure lawn

We came on a Sunday, late during the Lunch serving period and while a Wedding party was going on. No one was at the hostess stand. We waited for over 5 minutes, but no one came out. However, we were persistent and my husband and I went into the dining room to find someone to seat us. Although the dining room was only 25 % occupied, they asked us if we had a reservation. We said "No." And they seated us by the window anyway.Once we were seated, the service was swift and very attentive.We had eaten Brunch earlier, so I only wanted a quick bite to eat, and my husband only wanted a beverage. I had the Chilli Crab Spaghettini and I will definitely return again to enjoy it.I do, however agree with the others, Make a reservation
