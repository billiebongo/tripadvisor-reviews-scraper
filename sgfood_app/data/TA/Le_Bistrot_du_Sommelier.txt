Good place for French food but nothing amazing and prices are quite high. Lack of wine by the glass option as it was mostly Australian wine (surprising for a French restaurant).
5
Reasonable top notch French food, cosy place, great wine list, always a pleasure to be here for dinner
4
Scallop tartar was amazing, pork done in 3 different ways - must try!
Did not appreciate the 60 days aged beef as much as the other dishes though
Duck rilette and foie Grau pate was lovely
4
My Wife and I came here as part of our weekend staycation. Lovely meal. My wifeâ€™s steak was well prepared and delicious. My poulet was wonderful. I would definitely order either of these again. The recommended Pinot wine was reasonably good. The one oddity is that they served us a nice crusty bread, but no butter, olive oil, or anything. Just dry bread. The bill at the end was a bit of a surprise. Maybe not the best value for money, but very good food and I am certain we will return
3
We came by without reservation on a Saturday night but said we could come back 45 minutes later when a table was available. The service team was initially not interested but agreed to look out for an opening. When we returned we got a table, but it was bizarre that they then took a long time to wait our table and take our orders. We went for two classic french dishes, both tasty like you would expect from an authentic french restaurant, including the fries. We ordered red wine, but I'm pretty sure that what we got by the glass was NOT the same wine as it was presented (in bottle and for tasting) and what we were served. Pretty disappointing that wine experience by the glass. We were all the time polite, including when settling the bill to include a tip. A group of french guys were seated after us, got food earlier and left the restaurant before us. So, if nothing else, the arrogant service was authentic enough. Think the owner need to teach the staff how to handle people

The warm ambience of the place combined with the friendly service from the staff and unpretentious, simple French food, makes this place one of my favourite, go-to French restaurants in Singapore. It feels like dining in your usual neighbourhood bistro in Paris!My favourite food here is definitely the array of rillettes, can't go wrong with that, as well as their steak tartare and steak with shallots. SO GOOD!They also have a great selection of wines. Love this place for a casual date and will definitely come back

I had recommended coming to this restaurant for my husband's birthday dinner following dining here for my company's Christmas party. The service here is excellent with the Maitre D' even remembering me from the Christmas party. The food is exquisite as well (especially their mashed potato which is the best I have ever tasted). The only thing we were slightly disappointed about was that the steak we ordered to share between the 4 of us had too much fat vs meat. They made up for it by decorating our dessert plates for my husband's birthday
4
We ate upstairs in the Rillette Bar, I didn't see the main restaurant section so cannot comment on that. However the bar is cosy, high tables and bar stools and quite a bit of space between them so it doesn't feel that crowded even though it was quite busy.Very helpful staff, the manager recommended a selection of starters, including their rillettes which were very tasty and decidedly moreish. For the main course we shared a platter of cooked meats, some beef/steak and different cuts of pork. Accompanying this was pomme dauphinois and some vegetables. It was all well presented but I didn't think the meat platter was anything too special. It was perfectly okay but not amazing.Overall we had a fun evening but was rather surprised towards the end of the night when the manager turned a blind eye to a number of people who started smoking in the bar. We did complain about it, I believe it's not permitted in singapore, but the manager declined to do anything about it. That was disappointing
5
That was our hesitation till our son Gerald (also a chef in Australia) highly recommended the food here. The dinner for two exceeded our expectations on all scores. Well done to a young Asian team. The food was excellent! "Must eat" include the selection of in-house rillettes. Our favourite was the duck and we'll be back for the rabbit rilettes. We shared a generous portion of the roast leg of lamb and it was cooked to perfect timing with great flavour balance on a casserole of stewed peas served with mashed potatoes that you have to indulge it and throw all calorie concerns out the window becuase it was worth every mouthful. Typically, we pass the deserts but as we saw the smiles at every table when desert was served at their tables, we decided, why not try! We settled for the earl grey souffle baked to a fluffy puff. The sweetness was beautifully balanced with a refreshingly tarty accompanying French grapefruit. The smallish and narrow restaurant is manned by a busy team that seemed busy shuttling too and fro all evening. The restaurant was packed full and the atmosphere was very lively, like being in a Paris bistro... happy and friendly. Definitely a place to enjoy good food and great service! We had a brief moment to meet the young chef Brandon.. at 32, he epitomizes the new generation of young chefs who are passionate, talented and eager to serve up more than just good food! Well done and best wishes to him and the great team and Le Bistrot De Sommelier!

Only had an hour before a tour of The Pernakan Museum so we accepted the invitation to climb the stairs for a pleasant surprise. The ambiance and setting were attractive. Our server was informative both about the menu and the building. We finished off a perfect meal in great shape for an informative afternoon. Definitely a find
3
Visited once before but this time I didn't enjoy the food as much. Service wasn't great either. I doubt we will return.
5
It’s one of the most enjoyable restaurants - the service is great and the food is superb. Love it! Will be back for dinner another time.
3
We booked a table in advance, we end up with a pooly located one.
Food is great but servjce is slow.
Also a bit too salty.
Good but not great for the price level.
4
A great find with a solid wine menu and lots of cheese and charcuterie options! You should book as it gets pretty busy.
5
An ever reliable favourite when we’re craving hearty French food.- Escargots: yum, though we weren’t sure why it needed the tomato purée- Poulet au vin Blanc: our first try and boy, will we have this again. Could taste the white wine infused into the cream sauce. Generous portion with 3 big pieces of chicken and gloriously sweet veg.- Onglet de boeuf: generous 2 piece portion, fries great and a hearty portion of glazed onion made this dish very satisfying- PROFITEROLES were the highlight of the dinner. These are the real deal (ice cream, good quality chocolate), none of that whipped cream nonsense. A MUST HAVESommelier was attentive and recommended a good value Burgundy (lesser known commune but still good
5
I had the pleasure of dining at this fine French establishment on Christmas Eve with Mum. What a wonderful Christmas Eve!We had a table in Rillet Bar. The country pork terrine was delicious. Served with crunchy French bread, it was a winning starter. Perfect in proportion and taste. The salad selection was impressive too. Diverse territories of fresh flavours served on generously sized plates.The beef cassoulet was rich and a warm and hearty conclusion to our meal.Our selected and suggested wines accompanied the food perfectly. The staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly and greatly added to the relaxed French feeling of the restaurant. I look forward to returning on my next visit to Singapore
5
Service was efficient, friendly and helpful with recommendations. Food was just incredible - you must try the rillette and pates! I had the steak tartare which had the perfect amount of tanginess. The portions were generous but not too much. The atmosphere was buzzing and authentic
1
We ordered a starter with scallops, a beef tartare & joue de boeuf.The scallops tartare was obviously left in the fridge for too long, the joue de boeuf was tasteless and the tartare..hmmm... both of us got sick and had to leave the restaurant without finishing our meal.We definitely don't recommend this place even though we had a good experience on our first visit there several months ago
2
Went there for lunch a couple of months ago and was impressed by the food and atmosphere. Went there recently for dinner, and that will probably be my last time there.Three staff to run the ground floor bistro, and they were all inattentive to customers. They appeared to be deliberate to avoid eye contact and many customers including myself hv to wait for them to appear from the kitchen and calling for their service. No sincerity or enthusiasm to recommend the dishes, hv to ask for the wine list, again no suggestion or recommendation for wine.Prepared to tolerate all these in the pursuit of good food, but what a disappointment. The food is so average, and hence not a good value for money. Had the chef's special of braised beef ribs. Beef was tender enough but the sauce was saltish and overwhelming the taste of the beef. The much talked about onglet was again so saltish and the huge portion of fries just made the dish looked cheap. Less fries, less salt, less sauce to let the beef shines through would be so much better. The rest of the dishes were not even worth mentioning.No reason to revisit, too many good authentic French restaurants to go to instead.
3
The food was good however the setup was terrible. I booked the table about a week plus before the date but they gave me a very bad place such as at the corner or near the door where people will walk in and out often. The waiters weren’t suggesting us foos when they saw us so confused about the food. As we ordered quite a lot they didn’t say that the portion fit for 2 person. So we ended up order a lot and wasted the food
5
The Mont D’or was to die for and the chicken liver pate never disappoints. First time trying the pan seared onglet , beef was great, but what surprised me was how well the sauce complimented the beef. Will be coming back often!
5
I don't care about the hassle to reach the place! I love the homely warm lamb stew with cheese ravioli. Brightened my day!
5
Really great experience at the Riettes bar.
Amazing food and most of all a great Wine list!
It is obvious this restaurant is run by true passionate and professionals.
I wholeheartedly recommend this amazing restaurant.
5
Good food and environment for a quiet luncheon with friends. Portions are suitable for sharing. Recommendations were good and food was nicely prepared and served.
5
I booked with three friends on National Day. We had the choice to eat at the restaurant downstairs which is a little bit more intimate or at the winery upstairs which we finally chose. My first impression was super great, the staff are very professional and attentive and it was so nice to meet someone from Basque Country! They advised us very well on wine and food. They were super friendly which I think is necessary for a French winery. Instead of ordering main courses, we decided to do it like "à la Maison" with many platters to share. From snails, to homemade duck rillètes and cheese platter, everything was really good. Next time I am in Singapore, I will for sure go back! Thanks guys for the great service and the amazing food and wine
5
Birthday dinner went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday after passing by the restaurant. Was initially attracted by tHe cozy design of the place. We ordered the chef's special and it was absolutely delicious. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. One waiter spent 10 mins explaining the menu and the seasonal food they get. We definitely had a very pleasant evening. Only downside is the heavy price tag, but definitely worth it! Will go back.
5
Liked the ambience, the attention to details and the quality of the food and the wines as well, although the choice for wines by the glass could be more.We had Foie Gras , as an entree, we had steak tartar , duck confit , french spring chicken, fish and pork loin with mashed potatoes with cheese. All very tasty and the portions are so big!! We were with 4 people and we could not finish all the dishes.We will come bac
4
Went there specially for the cote du boeuf and steak tartare. Cote du boeuf was good but the steak tartare standard has dropped. The mince beef was too fine there was something lacking in the taste. I have been here many times but standard is dropping. Thanks to them for accommodating a child
5
I booked a table for 4 for a Friday night with another couple and what a pleasant surprise. We had a wonderful meal - so French, so authentic. Max, the owner and host attended our table several times and recommended a wine pairing that suited our meals. He also introduced us to the upstairs wine bar for our digestif. If you're looking for an authentic French rustic restaurant in Singapore which has a lovely homely atmospheric setting, then Le Bistro du Sommelier is for you. And to top it all - it's very reasonable - despite being in Singapore! :-
3
I invited a friend to the Bistro du Sommelier because of its name as we love a good wine experience. But I was quite disappointed by the very limited choice of wines by the glass. Only 3 red and 3 white french country wines (msot of them from the same maker). The food was very good though. So 2 stars for drinks and 4 stars for food..
5
I will be back very soon for the good steak, wine and service. Love the peaceful evening I had at the bar (second level).
5
Beautiful atmosphere, excellent service, and the food was simply delicious. Mashed potatoes were the creamiest ever, and beef was perfectly done!
5
Food and service was perfect. The staff really friendly and pro, and the food just amazing. Congrats to the chef and team.
Keep it up.
Definetely recommended.
5
We have visited many times for drinks and nibbles upstairs. I am never left disappointed and always leaving with a goody bag from the deli.
Always fabulous service from excellent staff with wonderful and authentic french cuisine.
4
This is my second time to the restaurant. This is also a birthday celebration. I like the ambience the place was cosy. Most importantly the food was good and so was the service.
5
Authentic french food . Home-Made Rilletes are stunning.
Large choice of french wines. Service is excellent , staff is great. Good Value.
3
ambience is great as is the assistance with the wine. really the bar upstairs is a better experience than the bistro. The food was fine without being anything special. What was disappointing was the staff packing up to close the restaurant around us - it was not late..
4
We had business dinner and it wasn't very casual so I couldn't release myself as much as I would like too. However, there is great choice of appetizers (try escargot) and deserts. You won't be sorry to opt for a chef's recommendation (asparagus in mozzarela foam were beautiful) or oven roasted Canadian pork cutlets . Wine however was hard to choose. There are so many options but if you're feeling adventurous, try Slovenian orange wines. They go great with frog legs :
5
French comfort food at a value for money offering. We had lunch for the family and ordered the set menu which was great! Wines were also easy to drink and very pleasant for it's price. Of course do expect this is at Singapore prices for wine
4
Probably a review that took a while to be penned but nonetheless, Le Bistrot du Sommelier reminds one of the typical parisian restaurant. Walk into it and you will feel as if you have been transported to a french restaurant in Paris - nostalgic I must say. My department had organised a Chinese New Year lunch at the restaurant late Jan and each of us ordered the set meal. I had the beef steak - tender, chewy and probably a little salty but it had the right texture. The sides of french fries was probably the best fries I ever had and well salted. Desserts was the profiteroles - homemade choux bun filled with vanilla ice cream, drench with warm chocolate sauce and crispy almond flakes. If you have a sweet tooth, this is a must try! Wait staff were friendly and accommodating as well. I would certainly return for a meal here with my loved ones
5
the roast beef is to die for, comes with lots of sweet onions. Red wine is generally good too. very hard to get a table though. do make reservations in advance
4
Small restaurant serving excellent french home-style food. The pates and rillettes are delicious! Even the house wines were good enough. Not cheap, dinner came to about $430 including a bottle of house red.
4
We visited Le Bistrot du Sommelier because one of us was craving for Boudin Noir. It was definitely a good call to visit. We actually went to the second floor where the Rillette Bar is. We had French tapas to share among 6 of us family. We tried their beef, which was top notch quality and taste. Most of the foods we had were of excellent quality, but we had order escargot, which they forgot to make at the end that turned out a bit disappointing (we didn't like the tomato in it). Service was excellent and ambience of the place was excellent too. Will definitely go back again if in the mood for French food and will definitely recommend to friends.
3
We sat in the down stairs dinning section. The interior is kept in a "French" style and is pretty cosy.The food is good. We had three different starters. Frog legs, snails and scallops. For msin course we tried two different ones: the beef tartare and the beef shoulder. It all tasted nice, but lacked a bit more depth to the taste.The service is good. Fairly personal in a good sense and attentive.The acustics were not great. It was very noisy/loud with many guest in the room. I would recommend they do something about that
5
We had the vacherin mont d'or stuffed with homemade chorizo with a side of potatoes, a delicious rich and hearty lamb stew, and the potato gratin. My boyfriend is a big eater but all of that filled us up to a food coma level. A very small, cute and romantic place. Staff are also very friendly! Would definitely recommend it and will be back for sure
5
We loved it! The food was reminiscent of what we'd be enjoying on a fine spring day in French countryside. The crusty bread and pork rillette was marvellous. We loved the escargots and garbure, a vegetable soup with pork sausage but the absolute highlight of our appetisers was the vacherin mont dor - a pot of melted cheese with onions and bacon served with steamed potatoes. Really must not be missed! Mains are in fairly large portions so I would recommend sharing esp if you've had the range of appetisers. We had the Angus beef rib (can easily share among four), incredibly tender beef cheeks and the French chicken. The French fries are crisp, salty and totally addictive!Must have the desserts - The best profiteroles and the hazelnut soufflé!The wine selection is super and service is helpful.
4
This is a personal favourite of mine whenever I can gather a group of 4 or more meat lovers. The restaurant doesn't allow customers to wine but to be fair they have an impressive and very affordable wine list and Max the owner is happy to recommend a bottle which suits your taste and budget.The highlight is always the Rillettes and the Cote de Boeuf which should be ordered at least a day in advance. It comes perfectly cooked (medium rare) with heavenly sides of caramelised onions and skinny french fries. Wash it down with a 10 year old Gigondas and it's the perfect match for a Friday night and prelude to a cheery weekend. For desserts, save room for the profiteroles which come with lashings of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. All you need to cap the evening is a fortified flat white.This is the place to chill and enjoy the crowd and the friendly service.8/1

The Rillette Bar upstairs at Le Bistrot du Sommelier is good spot for a glass of wine and a snack or a full bottle of wine and a meal. The decor is rustic and they specialise in rustic French rillettes and patés of duck, pork, rabbit, etc. They have quite a few warm dishes from a lamb cocotte with cheese ravioli all the way up to a 600g ribeye to share. Be forewarned that it's not inexpensive, but it is very good
3
What worked against it was the high expectations of food quality and service - it wasn't bad, but certainly not great.Long time to wait for the food - close to or just over an hour.......and when it did arrive, was good, but not great, despite the increased hunger
3
i went to le bistrot with high expectations having heard good reviews of it from friends. i was underwhelmed. the ambience was nice - cozy and quaint etc. i found the food just passable and service not up to scratch. food took forever to come and was nothing special given the wait and the cost (expensive). the waiter (who in all fairness was very pleasant) showed us to our table and appeared with a bowl of sorry looking beets. he said something about beets of that colour not being available in singapore. i wouldn't be proud of such beets and certainly wouldn't be showing them off - they looked sad and withered. one person at our table ordered the cod. turned out it wasn't available but the other waiter said it was being substituted by another fish (i think i heard turbot) that would be as good. it turned out to be very insipid and tasteless. two others at our table ordered steak cooked medium - when it came parts were medium but parts were really quite bloody. i wouldn't go back here in a hurry
4
I went to this place on a Monday night with friends. The frog legs were excellent. The cassoulet was solid without being exceptional. The wine was good. Service was attentive. It was busy for a quite Monday night. Solid and worth a visit.
5
As true joy from the friendly welcoming to service to food to wine. As close as true France as you can get. Highly recommended
5
I returned with a friend to this restaurant for the first time for a while and was very impressed.When making the reservation they sms'd us with details of items on the menu which required some time to order,in case we wanted to pre-order,which was a good idea.When we arrived they knew our preferences immediately,and also apologised for one item which was on the menu but not available.Good attention to detail.We started with frogs legs and salad which was excellent.My friend's John Dory fish was good but not outstanding.My duck breast (substantial when this option is often nouvel cuisine in restaurants) was superb.The apricot shuffle was to die for.The bread and butter were perfect.The service was excellent,a rarity in Singapore.My one negative about this restaurant is the wine.The wine list is interesting and extensive enough,but really comprises all expensive wines.I think they would do well to provide some more economic options for those who don't want to spend $100+ on wine
5
This is authentic French Bistro in the heart of Singapore. They have cleverly managed to create a lovely atmosphere serving delicious authentic food. The confit of duck is always a winner as are the frog legs and steak/frittes. They always have interesting and unusual french wines by the glass that enhance the food. Service is always with a smile. I have enjoyed many good meals here
4
Le bistrot du Sommelier is well located in a quiet street near to a car park: easy to park! The place offers both indoor and outdoor dining. The decor is simple but typical of french regional restaurant. Reminds me of the "bouchon" from Lyon. Staff is friendly and efficient. But the best is obviously the food and the selection of wines. The menu offers a good variety of french regional dishes, very authentic and very tasty. Try les rillettes or the soup de poissons or the onglet of beef... Delicious!The wine list is great. You have the choice between reasonably priced regionsl wines and the more renown chateaux. Nice selection of gourmet desserts as well will make the whole experience very enjoyable.

I was invited to this restaurant for dinner this week. I have never heard of it and it didn't seem easy to locate. However Gps guided me safely there and there was ample parking in an open space carpark just a 3 min walk away. I was invited to try their pig trotters which was a speciality. My friend ordered the duck. The pig trotters were braised and cooked till deliciously soft. It was served with potatoes and vege but those were unmemorable. What deserves review is that pig trotter! I wasn't a fan but I must say that this was simply delicious. The duck was also tender and well cooked. But special mention must be made of the canele. The outside was richly carmelized whilst the center was soft and yummy. It was simply delicious.
5
We tried this French bistro last night and I should admit that it is very very nice.It looks like a real French bistro, both ambiance and menu transport you in France.The food is delicious, good meat and well cooked. We chose the beef onglet with shallots and French fries and the beef fillet with girolles mushrooms, mash potatoes and red wine sauce. The cooking was perfect.For appetizer we had the mackerel and tomatoes rillettes (special mention for the homemade bread) and for dessert the crÃ¨me brulee. Yummy !Also we enjoy the service, attentive and efficient, friendly just what we need, not too much.All in all, a very nice dinner

came for a birthday celebration with family and was looking for a quaint, relatively authentic, french restaurant (not the steak and frites kind, but the more homey dish kind).starters - pork rillettes; came with amazing fresh french baguette (so good we got more to use for our main later as well), the rillette also amazing (they are famous for them here i believe, so of course at the end of the meal we decided to buy a whole packet to bring home to eat)salad with a mix of seafood (can't remember what kind now) - but the fish was fresh and delicious, and they ran out of one of the 3 different kinds so subbed in for more fish.mains - we shared a pot of the braised beef cheeks which were devine. the meat was melt-in-your-mouth soft and the stew sauce so rich and wonderful to mix with both the baguette and mash potato that came as a side. the second main we shared was the sausage duck ham cassoullette which was a little heavier in flavour. sausage was fat and flavourful, the duck and ham, i suppose due to the method of cooking, not as tender but still very tasty. dessert - as we felt we did not have quite enough food yet we decided to try a few desserts. the mains we felt (although recommended that those 2 to share would be enough) seemed slightly smaller than expected, so we decided why not try 3 desserts for 3 people? now i have to say the desserts are VERY generous in portion size! good for satisfaction, bad for the waistline!!! we ordered profiteroles (3 giant ones came with heapings of ice cream per profiterole), the hazelnut souffle (gigantic one!) and the pie of the day also with a huge serving of ice cream. all were amazingly sweet and delectable but probably just a little too much after all our previous food. NO REGRETS though!!wine - were recommended a good robust red wine to go with our meaty mains which went down very nicely too.would recommend this place for a quiet, quaint and authentic french food experience for sure!! and would be back to try more of the recommended mains!
4
At $35++ for the plat du jour, the quality was really good. The highlight was the dessert - almond flan with vanilla icecream, but everything else was well made. The excellent Mikulski Cote de Beaune was a great accompaniment to the steak frites.I'll be back. Going upstairs now to visit the bar..
5
We were recommended to this bistro by the Fullerton Bay Hotel concierge as a local, well priced classic French bistro. We were really pleased that the description was right on - a small oasis in bustling Singapore. Highly attentive and patient service, classic bistro menu (specializing in beef - I had the braised beef cheeks and my spouse had the joue de boeff). Topped it off with a rhubarb crumble for two - excellent but decadent. Only downside - wine pricing was toppy. The bistro was well patronized by locals
3
We've been here a few times with friends this year and we like it. Rillete is tasty (esp duck) and steak has never disappointed.
Apparently there's been a chef change recently but still a good meal. We'll try again...
5
Tight little restaurant just like the ones you'd find in Paris - chalk marked boards showing the day's menu adds to the feel of authenticity. Which is all fine but the real test is in the food. Fortunately the food did not disappoint. Casual style dining but fine dining style taste
3
Great food, sublime baked Vacherin. But don't expect any sense from the staff about why the house wine is $138 a bottle. Or why it's not called "house wine" on the menu. Or why there are wines for less than $90 sitting snugly beside the house wine on the menu that isn't a house wine. As my brother pointed out, "house wine? Might as well be mortgage wine!"Seriously the staff had this look of déjà vu when explaining this. It's clearly a problem and someone in management is having a laugh conning people out of their money with their clever wheeze. The "Sommelier" has made it his metier to make sure you pay
3
We went here last night with our daughters, aged 7 and 4 - wouldn't normally go for French with them but we were in the area. Most restaurants, particularly in Singapore, will show some flexibility for picky young eaters - Bistrot was having none of it - if it wasn't on the menu, then tough luck... Which is a shame as they serve some really good French food, nice charcuterie, a tasty hanger steak and good beef cheeks, all things my wife and I love - but this is a no kids zone so couples and business groups only... I get it, sometimes I want that too, I was just a little surprised and disappointed last night..
4
Delicious simple bistro food. The best beef tartar I have ever tried in Singapore so far (my favorite before Sommelier was the one in Barroque). So fresh tartar, huge portion. Only this makes up the dinner.My dinner companion has beef cheek which was also outstanding
5
Visited this great little restaurant for dinner on Saturday night for the sixth time in the past few years and once again had a memorable evening. Atmosphere, service, food and wine were all excellent - the duck rillettes and pig's head terrine were delicious, the traditional duck cassoulet with big chunks of streaky bacon, home made pork sausage and melt-in-your mouth lamb shoulder with white beans was hearty and wonderful, and the lamb shank braised with orange and fennel was very flavorful and falling off the bone. Add buttery potato puree, a dish of steamed vegetables and a bottle of cotes du rhone…a great meal! To finish, we shared a rhubarb crumble which was just the right mix of sweet and sour; and much as we would have loved to revisit the chocolate profiteroles we have so enjoyed on previous visits, we will have to leave that pleasure to our next return visit….Having always had great food here, cooked in the classic old fashioned French traditional manner, including hearty portions, and experienced helpful and attentive service on every visit, I believe Le Bistrot du Sommelier deserves a much higher rating amongst SIngapore's restaurants and would thoroughly recommend it for lunch or dinner
4
Our first foray in French cuisine in Singapore so difficult to compare but we really enjoyed our night at Le Bistrot. Most struck by the service - our waiter was subtle, attentive, reasonable when it came to choosing a French wine and advised us when we over ordered on food. Food was typically rich and meaty. We loved the French provincial soup but make sure you just get one between two. I thought the beef cheeks were memorable but have it with an appropriately heavy red
5
Dined here as a group of 4 celebrating a birthday. It was a busy night with many large groups and service was a bit shorthanded so some delays here and there, but luckily it didn't take away from a great meal and evening.Staff recommended the jerusalem artichoke, rillettes and other starters which were all great. Must try to visit the Rillette bar in future.The mains were the highlight, with one of the better roast chickens I can remember with amazing buttery sauce filled with grilled onions and garlic. Some people have complained food is oily and greasy, but what's wrong with that? Rich and delicious is how I'd describe it.The cote de beouf was great too. Better than most I've had in Singapore for the same price and it came with more sides and accompaniments than we could finish.Topped it off with dessert which I can't remember, although we aren't really dessert people.Nice bottle of wine was recommended to us. Slightly above average only though.Food is definitely the highlight for us. Will be returning soon
5
Bottle of wine, some of the rillettes, duck or pork and a main. Perfect evening. Escargot very creamy/garlicky. Onglet steak was cooked exactly to med rare. Steak tartare prepared like it's supposed to be. I need to go back so I can try a dozen other things here
3
I was happy to have found this place that serves seasonal french food. However, the experience was marred by the poor service from the phillipino waitress. She clearly distinguishes between service for a white person and asian women. She also made an mistake with my order and did not have the courtesy to apologise for the mistake. Instead she clearly showed her displeasure. It takes both good food and good service to do well as a restaurant. This hopefully will change when the restauranteur recognises that cheap labour could send customers running in the other direction
4
Food was great and the portion was large. Definitely good to share. Great atmosphere and place to go with group with friends.
2
Hoping for some French Bistrot food, we booked here. Starters were all either very fatty charcuterie, escargots. Main courses were swimming in heavy sauces. The waiter forgot about us and we had to call to him to get the plates cleared and ask for the next course. Wine was excellent but the selection of Bordeaux were quite poor. Decor so so although the bottleholder chandeliers with wine glasses were amusing and appropriate
1
Just got back from Le Bistrot du Sommelier. As a french canadian I am not as picky as a real french. I selected a botlle of wine of $88 for a 2012 Bourgogne from the menu and got charged $138 for a 2010. I complained to the waiter (indian) and spoke to the owner (singaporian) but they refused to admit their mistake. I ended up with a $250 for a below average meal. Went out telling myself I will never recommend that restaurant who is ran by indian cooked that have no clue of french food. The French ambassy should sue them for such a disgrace to french food. No ambiance no music

I have passed this restaurant several times when I park my car nearby. I came by for lunch recently with some friends. This was my first visit to this restaurant.We tried some of the restaurant signatures. Here are the highlights:- Home-made Rillettes: Duck Rillette ($10.80/ 100gm) and Rabbit Rillette ($12.80/ 100gm). These were served with house-made baguettes. The rillettes were mildly salty and paired well with the baguette. The rabbit rillettes weren’t gamey at all. Its nice. - Salade de Tomate: $19. Picadilly Sicilian tomato were halved and arranged neatly on the bottom of the plate. Its topped with basil mousse and Parmesan crisps. The tomatoes were fresh and sweet. The basil mousse was unique and complemented the tomatoes. - ‘Fillet de Poulet Roti’: Oven roasted free range chicken breast served with white wine and mushroom cream sauce and a side of mash potatoes. This was really god. My group loved it. The chicken breast was moist. The mash potato was a standout for me, so smooth and velvety. For my next meal, I can order this alone and eat it all by myself. - Filet Mignon de Porc, Saucisson a l’ail et ‘Papet Vaudois’ (for 2 pax): $65. Pan-seared pork tenderloin and home-made garlic pork sausage served with ‘Papet Vaudois’. The pork was pink in the middle but it tastes good. The sausage standsout for the flavour and you can find radish and garlic in it. Lovely. - Joue de Boeuf Braisee au vin rouge (200gm): $32. Served in a Chinese claypot, its red wine braised beef cheeks with carrots and mushrooms served with a side of parsley potatoes. The beef is fork-tender and flavorful. I even finished the gravy that was in my bowl. The baguette also goes well with the gravy.Dessert- Mille-feuille aux Framboises: $16. This was very pretty. It’s a raspberry ‘mille-feuille;, Opalys chocolate and vanilla whipped ganache. Couldn’t bear to cut into this dessert and spoil this ‘work of art’. Its light and easy to eat.- Profiteroles: $15. A big Choux bun filled with vanilla ice cream, drizzled with warm chocolate sauce and topped with almond flakes. Easy to eat and gone in no time. - Poached Plums: $14. This was a seasonal special. Plums are now in season and the chef poached the Reine Claude plums and served it atop bread pudding with vanilla ice cream on the side.It’s a good French meal. The portions are good sized. I recommend coming here with a bigger group of friends or family, so you can order more food and enjoy a wider variety of food.Food-wise, they were well executed and it’s a meal I will remember.For lunch, the restaurant has a 3-course TGV Set lunch at $35++ per pax (appetiser, main and dessert) which is good value

Bistro has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Over the years they have managed to keep the consistency up and deliver a great product. I must say I always liked their other location better, this one I don't think has the same cozy feel. It is always busy. But I wonder now if they are trying to hard? The food is still very good, don't get me wrong. But some things seem a bit too good. It just doesn't feel like that hearty bistro meal they gave you before, large portions with food brimming over. Something your mother would give you. it feels like its now got a bit of a 'designer' look and feel to it, as if they are trying to be better but its the same thing.The price now of course is way up there, you need to be prepared to spend some money for dinner, but for me personally I like the way they used to be, with a little more personalized attention from the owners and the big hearty meals

I visited with my wife and two other friends on Saturday and was hugely impressed. I can't believe that I've never been here before. It reminded me of Singapore when I arrived 12 years ago I.e well styled and very well thought out not a cookie cutter copy of the latest global trend. We ate upstairs. The venue is a well styled shophouse with high tables which work well in a group. There is music but it is discreet and cool and is unlikely to offend. The food was classic bistro fare and was delicious. We had a duck and a rabbit terrine which were delicious. The lamb stew was very good and all are in sharing friendly sizes. And then they brought out the beautifully cooked artichoke which was stunning. We drank a great Bandol at 98 bucks a bottle as well as some nice craft beer. Bravo! I eil be bringing my wife back for a date soon

Brought to this small place by my colleague for lunch as it was near office.The food was nice and the ambience good and cosy. The food was of a large portion and definitely value. The beef I ordered was of reasonable quality but probably due to the way the meat is being sliced, there is some tough chewy part.The dessert was huge and the ice cream accompanied were pretty one of the most generous portion given by a restaurant. Pity that the other dessert of creme brulee was not hot enough.There is no need for reservation in a weekday lunch

I don't understand the positive reviews, perhaps this place has changed hands? The food was like a copy of good French food prepared by someone from a recipe with no idea of what to taste for or what was important in the preparation. The final dish presented was far below the average French restaurant in Singapore.The service was the worst I have encountered. Slow, unsure, generally very poor.The name of the restaurant is Bistrot du Sommelier, but it was a stand out for the worst wine service ever. First, they were out of the two best wines by the glass, then for the third one they had just over a glass left in the bottle. The waiter swirled the bottle dramatically and poured it all out in one movement, smiling like I should be happy he'd given me large serve. All he had done was swirl all the sediment into my glass, which was undrinkable.The service staff was dressed very casually, which I don't mind, but the dirt and open toed shoes were not a great look.Avoid this as there are many, many better options in Singapore

I went here to celebrate with some girlfriends and if you're looking for a place with quality, French home-style cooking, then this is it!Every dish was flavourful (some perhaps even a little too salty) but overall it was a great experience, with the dessert perhaps being even better than the mains!! Best souffle I have ever had, as well as some monster giant profiteroles! Yum yum yum!

I have dined at this restaurant on 2 previous occasions and have been favourably impressed by the good French cuisine and friendly service. However, my last visit was over a year ago and I was surprised and rather concerned after reading the few adverse reviews posted here. I have just visited the restaurant again earlier this week with my family (9 of us in total) and I must say we greatly enjoyed the excellent food - the Côte de Boeuf, Duck Confit, Duck Cassoulet, Oven-roasted Lamb, duck & pork rillette, Duck Foie Gras Terrine and the scrumptious desserts - the Coconut Souffle and Profiteroles were amazing!The service was very good and our waiter "Sam" was friendly and very helpful in ensuring we did not over-order. Overall, we had a great time and enjoyed the fantastic French cuisine. I would highly recommend this place (don't be put off by the few adverse reviews and go!

Family dinner last night. Started with Rillettes, terrines, pate etc and each chose a main course. Servings are he which offsets the sticker shock to some extent. Wine list moves up in price pretty quickly but some very good wines there.

We decided to have dinner at Bistrot Du Sommelier after visiting the Peranakan Museum which is just a few doors away.We tried the Asparagus salad, which consisted of a mound of rocket leaves with chopped asparagus below and a pile of warm, crispy parmesan waffles with dollops of cream in between each layer. We also shared the rough country terrine which was served on a bed of cold lentils together with crusty brown bread.As we did not want to have a very heavy dinner, we just shared one main dish which was their daily special - it turned out to be an excellent choice as the braised beef shoulder was delicious, tender and gelatinous on a bed of mash. It was topped with a mass of black trumpet mushrooms together with a few leaves of baby spinach and crispy deep fried potato slices. The combination of tastes and textures in each bite made this dish a winner! Service was prompt, obliging and knowledgeable about the dishes and their ingredients.They also offer a selection of rilettes and pates for eating or to take away. Their mains featured meat dishes like beef, rabbit, lamb and chicken and portion sizes were mostly made for sharing. Unfortunately, we were too full to try their desserts. Our bill came up to S$91 for two (without drinks).

I came across the restaurant when it was recommended as one of the places other chefs go to. I certainly was not disappointed even though I booked just 30mins beforehand and only one table was left. The decor upstairs was not particularly enticing and the tables were too narrow with couples kinda "sharing" a table. It would be better to have a classic bistro style seating arrangement. However, the service was excellent. The key was the food. The restaurant served more than the selection of standard Bistro style cuisine which was the outstanding part. I tried the frogs legs and my wife tried the salmon. Both were excellent, and in particular the frogs legs were really one of the highlights, done perfectly with a crusty outside and tender meat with loads of garlic! I have been to quite a few Parisian restaurants and can say it is done better than in Paris! We also had the white asparagus, which was not was well done as I would have liked. It did not have the tenderness and melt in your mouth texture but the taste was good. Rather than vinagrette dressing, a simple butter dressing would have better. For mains, I had the Rabbit in cider, and again what a wonderful dish, with a rich white sauce that brought out the flavour of the succulent rabbit. To finish off, the dried plums with vanilla ice cream was not too rich and really hit the spot. I have read some of the reviews from the other authors and really can't understand what had been the problem unless the chef had an off day. The servings are quite large so one must be careful not to over order. Its a little gem and cannot recommend it more. French Provencial cooking at its best

The place is located at Armenian st. I just gave my chance to walk in. They have a spot for me as i came a bit early at around6.30pm.Went there to try the roast chicken but one they have is for lunch.one at dinner is good for two. Waiter are friendly and recommends special of the day. The service was pretty good. Food wise: portion is quite big. Even my meal i ordered : lamb cheek, was a bit big for one. They have wine selection too. A glass of red cost me around sgd$22, as for the meal (lamb cheeck) cost around $38. Price wise is a bit above the market. Rsvp is highly recommended. I was quite lucky i got a table available

I have been to this restaurant for the 3rd and last time. Each time was a big disappointment! The selection of wines is very nice but no sommelier to help you out. What's the point then to name it bistrot du sommerlier? When it comes to food here also they have it all wrong: bad quality and systematic wrong cooking! They manage to serve meat pieces that are wrongly cut and overcooked! With what they charge you would expect to have somebody in there to know how to cook a piece of meat, this is not rocket science! The side dishes are OK but when it comes to the leek gratin and it turns out that there are more potatoes in your gratin than leek you wonder why they still call this way. The service is just in line with the overall experience...I think you got it, just don't waste your time here

Since we often crave classic French, we’ve been coming to Bistrot du Sommelier for years. Although location has changed, quality hasn’t. For a recent lunch, we decided to sit in the casual-chic rillette bar (high tables, friendly for groups too) and started off, appropriately, with Duck Rillettes and Pork Terrine. Duck Rillettes were our favorite- texture just right, delicious flavor, and very nicely served with some refined lentils, little cornichons, and of course fresh baguette. On chef’s suggestion we decided to go for the Ox Tongue with “Grenobloise Sauce”, and although I’m not usually a fan, the meat was melt-in-your-mouth and served up beautifully seasoned. Other mains included the Cote de Boeuf with shallot & garlic confit (scrumptious, if a little more cooked than we might have liked) and Oven-roasted Lamb Saddle, which was tender and juicy, plus sumptuous potatoes au gratin. A nice mix of steamed veggies helped us feel about 5% less guilty… but we made up for that at dessert, by ordering the copious Profiteroles and absolutely not-to-miss Rhubarb Crumble (2nd excellent surprise of the meal). Manager Myra was on hand whenever we needed her, but was never intrusive - 2 thumbs up on the service. Highly recommended to get your French fix
4
So this is my second time in 4 days going to a casual restaurant with fine-dining prices. But this time round, because we had wine, I think it's not so bad. We started with some rillettes, which were ok. We shared 3 mains: the steak and fries (very nice!), the wild boar (good too) and the stuffed quail (also good). For dessert, we had profiteroles (excellent!), a creme brulee (good enough) and a cheese platter (nice! only wish they served crackers instead of bread). Now, I just wish they'd bring down the prices a little, considering this is not a fine-dining establishment
4
This restaurant is very hard to book. But now I find a solution. I book the upstairs Rillet & Cheeze Bar instead. Yes, the seating is a bit different - on high stools and small bar tables but the feeling is more relaxed and casual. Only complaint is that they have the TV on with foodie programmes on over and over again. You choose your wine and then start with all sorts of rillet - we tried their ox tongue rillet yesterday and it is good. We always enjoy the pork or duck rillet. Their cheese plate is also very good if you really know French cheese and their vibrant flavours ! Their wine selection is also very good and I always enjoy their bread. It just taste like the real French bread ! I always ask for more bread to be served. Maybe I should not write too much as next time I can't even find seats upstairs ! Bon Appetit

Supposedly one of the better French restaurants in Sing - their prices suggest they think they are - they really are not. Staff not necessarily rude but fairly oblivious - you might expect in a bar here but not when paying premium prices. I was in the restaurant when it wasn't busy at all but I still had to wait 10mins for someone to show me menu and ask what i wanted to drink. They were also poorly presented and frankly would have struggled in a hawkers.Food exceedingly bland - the l'escargot was a complete mess, the steak tartare had no flavour at all - might as well have got some mince out of the supermarket and just dumped it on the plate. McDonald style fries accompanied it - and tasted as bad. And somehow they had managed to burn the creme brulee (!)The top line of menu items were written in French and the wine list is exclusively French. And that's where any authenticity starts... and ends
3
Made a couple of visits in the last couple of weeks, following strong recommendations from (usually) smart friends. It is an interesting place with some earthy French fare (rillettes, saucissons, etc) as well as interesting cheeses, with some unusual, hard-to-find ones (you can also take-away all this stuff). The wine list is quite eclectic, if somewhat expensive, even by Singapore standards. As in all such places in Singapore, it is a place to go to if you get a hankering for some unusual food/cheese, as long as you are prepared to pay for it
1
Outdoor seating is in a horrible back alley without lights. Couldn't see the food. The food was not nice and the service terrible. The duck confit was just a casserole with a hint of duck. Terrible!
4
Had drinks and snacks upstairs in a great space . Good wine selection
Artichoke and duck app v good
Dinner downstairs served quickly and all very good

My husband and I had dinner here tonight and were very disappointed. Starting with the service that was appalling, the staff were very casual for the price point and did not understand the menu or the wine, The head waiter poured the dregs of the bottle into my husbands glass after swilling the bottle to pick up the particulates at the bottom. We paid over 200 dollars for very poor food and wine. This is not a place to go for french wine, expensive and poor quality for a place that is called Sommelier! The food is bland and served in Asian clay pots, nothing French about it. The beef cheek jus was watery and had no flavour, for the first time I had to ask for salt and pepper in a restaurant. The restaurant was still half empty on a Saturday night at 8pm but they sat each table close together, not necessary to be sitting on top of each other. Worst meal in Singapore, I would not recommend
1
This is an oft mentioned restaurant, so we finally relented and booked a table. Oh boy!The food itself isn't bad nor is it particularly good BUT nothing really makes sense - very rustic dishes priced at contemporary prices, entire service staff giving the vibe of being more comfortable in a hawker centre than in any type of modern restaurant (some wearing dirty t-shirts etc), incredibly noisy room downstairs, bizarre bar upstairs (TV showing old French cooking shows, unappealing dÃ©cor, same hawker-centre staff)... Overall, a completely over-hyped, over-priced and under-whelming restaurant, best avoided

I recently visited for a Friday night dinner with my wife. I booked about 30mins in advance and there were only outside tables left. I would suggest sitting inside as it is Spore and it's hot and we sat next to a building site, although it was covered up and the work had stopped there was still something going on behind the boards. Also the lighting is very dimm only a few little lights, to be honest they needed a few more.Inside looked cosy and had a great atmosphere.The food was great. From the delicious pate which you can also order as takeaway to the sizeable Onglet covered in onions and garlic. Wonderful!The service and knowledge of the waiters was very good, it's not usual to get such service.And very reasonably priced.It has been sometime since I have really felt satisfied after a dinner in Singapore and for sure we will be returning. This time with an inside table
4
We had the cheese appetiser and shared in our table of 4. The cheese was nice, smooth and goes will with the white wine infused into it. For mains, the ladies ordered the onglet and we had the lamb. Both were delicious and well prepared. Dessert was the Apple Sorbet (which tasted more like Prune) and the Profiteroles. Overall a nice pleasant meal on a saturday afternoon. Our waiter Sam was great and provided exceptional service
2
We went with great expectations as the first we went to this restaurant it was fantastic. Charcuterie was great, very delicious. Main course.....we were a table of four but had different tastes, limited choices of just a meal for 1, mostly meals for 2. Difficult if you were just a couple and didn't like the same thing could be a problem. The steak tartare came out chilled not at room temperature and the accompaniments lacked the Worcestershire sauce which wasn't even in the kitchen. I don't feel this was a proper French restaurant. Our stomachs were not quite right the next day

This was my second visit to the restaurant. My wife and I enjoyed our first so much that we brought our friends , who are quite particular on food, service and ambience. The restaurant was crowded on the Wednesday but not too noisy. The menu has some interesting and creative items , a very good selection of beef options as well, and some fantastic cheese and pate choices. The beef dish was well prepared , meat was tender , succulent and full of flavor. The pork sausage and pork belly dish is very unique- served in a claypot with sauerkraut , very tasty and hearty. The catch of the day was baked salmon , very fresh and the flesh was cooked just right with the correct pink tone. There was little left on each of our plates! There is a good choice of desserts but we shared the profiteroles - an excellent choice if you like cool ice cream and chocolate sauce after a hearty meal. Service is good and attentive. Definitely a recommendation for good french cuisine in a pleasant and warm ambience
4
Cool place. Always got a crowd but never to much. Simple menu. High quality produce prepared by people that know what they like, know what they are doing and how to deliver it. Good bunch of people and I respect them for this place. Great great wine list and knowledgeable people behind it. And the miracle is they arent pretentious. Go. Eat
4
I really love the food in this restaurant. Made with passion and full of quality and flavors. Try the rillettes as a starter and the angus beef to share for your mains. They are to die for.. The specials of the day are usually a very good choice too. Make sure to ask the staff for recommendations on what is good and fresh. They also have a very nice wine menu; particularly if you like French wine. The place is quite small so reserve a table in advance. The ambience is lovely and it really makes you feel that you are in an authentic French bistro. The staff was super friendly and attentive but we got our table almost one hour late (they made us wait in the bar upstairs) and the food was slow to show up at the table. We also had an error on the bill that was corrected without a problem. The overall service experience was a real disappointment, but unlike what I have experienced during previous visits. Go there for the food and the ambience. A bit pricey but you will love it
4
My prefered french restaurant in Singapore. Love the meat, superbe desserts. Ask the specials, always good. Beef cheeks or pepper steak are my favourites
1
They said the food would take 30 mins. 1 hour after ordering they hadn't even started preparing the food. Very rude, too.
5
Yes, I'm back!
Yes, I over-ate (again)!
Yes, blood sausage!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
(Sometimes, one really doesn't need to use a hundred words to get the message across... Especially when the food here is soooooooooo good!)
4
For a table for 2 we had a selection if rillette which is what the restaurant is known for. Very typical French set up with close tables and very knowledgeable staff. Fun dining experience if you're tired of eating the usual everyday stuff.
4
This restaurant offer bistro french cuisine. I went there with 3 of my friends. We we greeted by a friendly french lady upon arrival. Food served in a very homely classical french style. The portion was really generous. Actually you can order 2 mains to be share among 4 of us, since we are a small eater. Anyway what's really great was the taste of the food. It was prepared in a way that you could actually taste the fresh ingredients that were used. you could not find any wrong with the food. Service wise just expect a friendly bistro service. Really good value for food and wine

There are so many mediocre and over priced restaurants here that it was a pleasure to be introduced to somewhere that can cook good honest food. Let's start with the bread - proper pain de campagne, crusty and fresh. Living in Switzerland, we were amused to be offered a tartiflette for starters - reblochon cheese over lardons and potatoes. The others pronounced it good, I stuck to an assortment of spicy green leaves with a piquant dressing. For minas, my husband and I chose the New Zealand gurnard which was perfectly cooked in a saffron cream sauce, with mussels and cauliflower (with some silly foam), very tasty and delicate, as always with saffron; while our friends chose the roast pork for two, which was both rare (not for pork, please!) and a bit fatty. They were disappointed. Though not with their profiterole dessert; my husband apple ice cream with calvados was just the pudding I make apres ski, though I do mine with pear sorbet and poire Williams! However as a non red meat eater, my choices were very limited, and Im not really supposed to have dairy either, so had I been strict there was nothing I could eat on the menu apart from green salad! So vegans be warned. Mind you, French restaurants don't cater for vegans any day of the week
4
Busy and lively bistro atmosphere. Simple small tables without tablecloths, just as I like. And the most important: food. Everything was excellent: snails, duck leg confit, beef tartar and green apple sorbet, but favorite of all: frog legs.Their Chateauneuf-du-Pape wine was excellent and good value for money
2
Came here as ex French dwellers and hoping for a bit of refined French cooking. Having found such excellent restaurants in Singapore as La Petite Cuisine, La Saveur and the French Market Stall we thought this must be good! No, not the case - it is over-rated, over priced and certainly very dated cooking. The main course choices are essentially stews! The first course recommendation of Haddock turned out to be a very strong smoked haddock, not that expected at all!Wine - well, asked for a house red and offered an average Pinot Noir at 98 dollars! When asked if we enjoyed the meal - the french waitress respond on auto pilot! we said - 'it was OK" - "perfect" she replied - what an insult!
4
food is amazing from beginning to end, service is good but this restaurant is not the best for a romantic dinner as the tables are very close to each others and the atmosphere is more to friends/family gathering. Will come back soon with friends for the food, but not for a romantic occasion (then i would recommend Taratata Bistrot
3
Western food in Singapore is hit and miss but the food is probably the best thing about this place. Great portions, nicely presented but just really expensive. We are talking London prices and more and as one reviewer commented, about 4x the price of Paris.Starters were good but padded with a lot of generic salad greens instead of what you've really ordered. Mains were probably the best but desserts were nothing special.The wines we originally ordered were not available but then substituted with something 'in the same range'. Other reviewers have noted this practice before.The bill can just get horrendously out of control especially when in a group and with the staff making an effort to up sell everything, particularly the wine and more and more bottles. The sharing plate of beef at $168 was really expensive and whilst it was good, a single diner can get a shared portion of a bill upwards of $150 for sharing some beef, some wine and a starter. Overall, good food but really, really expensive and one needs to be careful
5
There are very few true European restaurants and even fewer excellent ones. And this has to be some of the best French food I have had ever, anywhereI have been to Le Bistrot du Sommelier many times over the years both at their old location and the current one on Armenian Street. It is true, the service can be a bit slow, but it is definitely worth the wait for the food. Since they moved to Armenian Street, the only place I eat is upstairs in the rillette bar. They a wide selection of different little bits and bites --- various types of rillettes as well as a whole heap of other delicious choices of meat. Most of the dishes are prepared in house --- so the star rillettes are prepared in house. I'm quite a cheap person so I only give myself the pleasure of going here 4 times a year - but it's also a good thing or else I would super fat
4
I have been to Le Bistrot du Sommelier for the second time this week. Both times we were a company of two. The first time, I was invited and the main item was the hot Vacherin... it was excellent but - together with some other high-cholesterol offerings (rilette) a serious test on the system. During my recent visit, we took an array of not excessively heavy items: escargots, cheese platter (excellent selection of prime quality representatives of each variety) and a generous helping of a fabulous beet root salad. My friend insisted on having a second bottle of wine and sneaked in an order of beef (I don't know what he ordered but guess it was the cote de boeuf - cote without bone)... and man was it good! The seasoning of cracked pepper and salt and the cooking was perfect. There are many places for a good steak in Singapore but I cannot remember to have had a piece of beef that was that enjoyable - neither at any of the upmarket dedicated steak places nor at any of the other French restaurants of high distinction. Absolutely fantastic
5
It had been some time since I'd eaten at Bistro du Sommelier and restaurants in Singapore tend to fluctuate wildly over a short period of time,so it was interesting to try it again.The meal exceeded expectations even though those expectations were high.The service,often a bugbear in Singapore especially since the government has tightened up on work permits in the service industry,was exemplary,with a clear description of the day's specials,just the right amount of attentiveness,and a good receommendation for the wine (a Cotes du Rhone).My companion and I shared a starter of a frog's leg salad,and for the main course she had one of the specials,an excellent grilled pigeon,while I had hare stuffed with foie gras in a bed of perfect mashed potato.All almost perfect.My only criticism,and a minor one,is that the dessert menu is somewhat unimaginative.The desserts are all okay but ones you see in European restaurants everywhere here,but nothing to get excited about.The restaurant is a good reflection of a bistro experience you might have in France itself,and it would be nice to have something more interesting you typically find in France such as tarte tatin,ile flottante etc.That is a minor quibble,and we left feeling very full and very satisfied
5
There are two separate 'concepts' here where the restaurant/bistro, with proper tables and chairs, is downstairs... whilst the upstairs is more a Rillettes Bar with tall tables and bar stools and I'm a big fan of the latter where Patrick makes probably the best Rillettes and pates in Singapore
4
I had been visiting this restaurant over the last 5 years and had never been disappointed by the food. They serve honest and delicious homely french food. The rillettes, the cote de boeuf, frog leg are one of the best in town. This is a bistro and we shall not expect fine dinning service standard. However, there are rooms for improvement.The few serving staff lack basic friendliness and lack product knowledge. The last I visited, a wrong desert was served but the staff that served it refused to admit that it was a wrong quite arrogantly. It was later verified by a more experience staff and replaced with the right one. On Saturday, they run the 2 seating system and we were practical rushed through our dinner. This restaurant serve great food, but the service can sometime spoil the whole dinning experience. If you like to have the time and right service attention to enjoy their excellent food, do it on a less busy weekday lunch or dinner
4
I had recently a meal at Le Bistrot du sommelier, overall it is good value for money, really French bistrot cuisine however choice is limited for main courses. Interesting rillettes menu presenting as dim sum choice. Taste overall of rillettes was acceptable. Nice wine list hand picked from artisan wineries from France. Service was casual and overall good menu for mone

My workplace is within the vicinity of this place and have been coming here more frequently of late even though I loathe staying so close to the office for meals which I treat as my escapes from the daily grind...Go up the stairs to the bar area which is more casual and you'll be greeted with a more tapas styles menu which is great for sharing and tasting the great flavours from Chef Patrick's kitchen. There's an extensive list of on premise-made sausages, terrines and other preserved meats, along with some tasty and authentic French hot dishes.My personal favourites are the duck rilletes and the Pig's Head Terrine. Do NOT miss this dish. I haven't been able to find another place in Singapore that serves it and it is absolutely delicious. It is a MUST try here. The rilletes are all also awesome.Service is well informed and casual and I love the intimate nature atmosphere of the whole place. The decor is unique in it's industrial-meets-traditional shophouse design. Be warned that prices are a little steep for the portions though.It's definitely a place to come and enjoy a night with friends. Great tasting plates and lots of good wines to keep the conversation flowing. Needless to say, it's become a favourite place to entertain guests from out of town now.And one last note. Remember to save space for desert. The profiteroles are to die for. :-

This was a lovely french dining experience. Upstairs we had cocktails before dinner and ordered our meal which we had in the down stairs dining room. The service was excellent and all the dishes on the menu were all very tempting but settled for the special of the day.. Not disappointed. Will definitely go back there again

I've been to this place several times in the past, however I don't plan to go back anytime soon.First, it's very expensive for what it is, basic hearty French food - I went there last week with a friend of mine... a couple of cold cut appetizers, a 'cote de boeuf', and a bottle of wine later, we had a bill close to 400 SGD - easily 5 times what you would spend in Paris for a similar meal! the wine list in particular is ridiculously expensive, you can't find a drinkable bottle (i'm not even saying decent) for less than 120-130 SGD! Anyway... You would think that with such a price tag, the management is focusing on delivering a high quality service - it's just the opposite! The place has become a cash cow I am afraid : inside, the sound reverberates - the table I booked inside last time was close to a group table of ~10 people - some kind of student reunion, half drunk, who spent the evening in a shouting & giggling match that gave me a headache - several tables around were visibly annoyed as well. Service was very friendly but awfully slow... do you really need 1 hour to cook a piece of beef? I am not coming back, I am not bringing guest from abroad anymore, that's it. If you want to risk it, here is what I suggest:- pick a table outside - I'll choose sweating over the inside noise anytime. the occasional roar of a passing Ferrari is pleasant in comparison.- order wine by the glass. - better still, consider your options : 'le bistrot du vin', near great wall city, is just as good and much more reasonably priced (service is better too). "L'angelus" in Club street, "les bouchons rive gauche" at Robertson quay are all superior choices... bon appetit :

We had a great afternoon at this place. Authentic french food, impressive range of wines (they have to live up to the restaurant's name after all) and pairing advice. Really professional wait staff, and friendly chef who came by to say Hi. More photos and details here. http://littlebluebottle.blogspot.sg/2013/08/le-bistrot-du-sommelier.htm

Unbeatable Food, Wine, Service and Atmosphere. Recommend a trip to the bar to start things off. The Cote de Boeuf is very good. Will definitely return

Best French food this side of the Rhine...excellent food, wine and service...all home made from fresh ingredients. Great setting. Definitely will return again.

I have to say I love the place and their tartare and onglets are usually great. However this time the onglet was not tender at all, and before we asked for coffee they asked us to bring the bill and to leave asap because others guests were coming. This is definitely not acceptable and sad for this place I used to recommend a lot
2
went to this restaurant after reading abt rave reviews abt the place. food was ok , but service was not there . they made a mistake of giving us the wrong orders and when we insisted to change, a lady allowed with a black face.Waitress was not very attentive , before we finiz our query , she was off to another table. I ordered a glass of wine , my bad , I din scrutinize the bill carefully and was grotesquely overcharged (I suspect they lump the still water n servings of drinking water with it 
4
Finally, a relaxed venue in Singapore with a great wine list and good drinking food - pate, bread, cold cut meats etc. A choice of indoor a/c or outdoor seating is great. Service was initially a bit slow but improved over the course of the evening. A real winner was when my chosen wine was not available, they gave me a more expensive bottle at the lower price. I'll be back

I deliberately put "excellent service" in the headline as reading other reviews, there seems to be inconsistency here.We "walked in" during our visit of the Singapore Art Night Festival.The waiter, looking after us was from start to finish, professional, friendly and attentive. I mentioned to my wife, that if I was to be in F&B, I would hire him away. I did not ask his name. He mentioned he was from Johor in Malaysia. Excellent guy.There were other staff serving us at times, and all were equally good.So now I have that of my chest, over to the food and beverage.Our friend from Johor did the wine suggestion and he was spot on every time.The frog legs and snails we ordered was quite superb, the frog legs some of the best I have tasted. The mains, we both had the beef steaks with fries were cooked to perfection. The fries exactly what you would expect them to be. Shoestring and perfectly cooked and salted.As a desert, we shared the Colonel. Lemon sorbet with vodka.As for the cost, we spent $303.00 which included $140.00 wine.All in all a great dining experience and we will be back
3
This was our second visit this year. The food was quite average. For starters, we had the day special which was baked lobster and greens as well as the tomato salad. For the mains we had the the Cotedeboef and the Gigot Agneau (Lamb) which was as we expected.For desserts I had the profiteroles. What was quite disappointing was the wine selection. The white we had, Bach M Brgeb (2011) and the red, Aurage (2007) were quite ordinary but pricey at $88 and $128 respectively. What I was most disappointed was the way the waiter kept coming back after we made the selection saying that what we wanted was out and proposing something more expensive.Even when we were looking for a dessert wine to finish the same happened. Often they would also propose something without naming the price. I think the restaurant name is quite misleading to the customers and we felt like so. The food is pricey too, the cost is about $70 pp for the experience
5
We had a chill out weekend for the family, and what better way to finish than a visit to our favorite French restaurant in Armenian street. The duck rilette was fab as always, as was the suckling pig/rabbit terrine. The Joue de Boeuf braisee was incredibly tender, and the stuffed pig trotter was amazing. We finished with the sky-high coconut soufflÃ© and the green apple sorbet which was simply perfect. Puts a smile on your face with each bite!
3
First time we went to this restaurant thought it was great. It is a loud buzzy small restaurant. The disappointing thing about the second visit was the service. We had to constantly ask for the wine to be poured which I found irritating since they said that it was a $78++ per person minimum I felt they were setting a standard and stopping people from just popping in for a drink and taking up room, which is fine, but I don't like the fact they tell you your minimum price before you get there as I can't imagine getting out of any restaurant in Singapore under that. It irritated me that the waitress, when not a proper sommelier, thought she should have a decent taste of every bottle we ordered, we felt she was not enjoying servicing our table. The food was very good, had no problem with that, but would I bother going back...... Probably no
5
I came here for dinner with my other half and friends several times, this place never disappoints.The food is consistently very delicious, good portion, and also the service is great. I love the vegetable soup, the duck terrine and the steak. The meat is succulent, juicy.. They also make the best mash potatoes ever! The cooking is like home cooking which makes it more special and rustic French. I recommend to make a reservation few days in advance...
4
If you are looking for genuine French food and have been to France, you will know that this place sells you what you are looking for. Service is unpretentious and the portions are big. Love the foi gras terrine!
5
Le Bistrot offers something different in Singapore and also never disappoints. The portions are generous to say the least and the wine prices are excellent if you ask for advice. Le Bistrot follows a tried and tested formula but the guys in charge have now perfected their art. Really excellent
2
It's hard to believe that a respectable joint with generally good food would deign to sully its reputation with such a move, & all for a measly S$14...Last Fri, after finishing our mains, waiter came by asking if we wanted dessert, we said we would pass as we were stuffedWhen he asked again, a friend (who evidently hadn't been there before, & more of that later, below) asked casually "what do you do for birthday people"Waiter said he would offer us 1-for-1 for any dessert we orderWe replied that we would let him know if we changed our mind & carried on with our conversationUnknown to most of us at the table, before leaving us, waiter discreetly asked 1 of my friends for my name (yes, I was the birthday boy)Shortly after, we were served with a plate of profiteroles with lit candle implanted & my name inscribed in chocoloate ink on the rim of the plateAll of us were surprised because none of us had placed the orderNonetheless, we went with the flow, sang birthday song, took a gazillion handphone pix etcWe were surprised when the bill came, to see the birthday profiteroles being charged despite us not having ordered it(Most other establishments would have given it FOC, but not Le Bistrot du Sommelier, & more of that later, below)If the fact that we didn't reject the birthday profiteroles was interpreted by the waiter as a tacit confirmation of the involuntary order made on our behalf, then he should have had the decency to also offer another free dessert (per his 1-for-1 spiel) or failing that, explain why we were chargedBut no, he neither offered nor explainedIt made us wonder how many other guests have been similarly charged Considering that our bill was not exactly paltry, this cheapened the entire dining experience for us, & spoilt what was otherwise an enjoyable night out...It also made one of our friends (who already had misgivings about this restaurant after previously making enquiries & being told unceremoniously that she couldnt bring in a birthday cake & that the restaurant would give her a candle atop any dessert order - that's their modus operandi, folks) remark that she would not be backPS 1: If they had the decency to check with us before serving us the birthday profiteroles, my friends would have told them that I'm allergic to bovine dairy & almonds both of which were key ingredientsPS 2: On our 2 previous visits, we'd fedback about the chewiness/rawness of their pork neck dish, only to be told "that's how we do it". Granted, pork neck has a somewhat elastic texture, but there's something to be said of the way it's cooked if its consistently rubbery & raw. So, if you don't like your pork neck cooked that way, steer clear, like we did last Fri..

We had a birthday dinner to celebrate so we assembled a big group for dinner and it was also my second time back to the restaurant. I was told that the restaurant would impose a minimum charge of S$78++ per person but as I knew the voracious appetites of my group well, I accepted it. The restaurant sent a text a day prior to confirm the booking. I liked this unintrusive method of communication. And also took opportunity to SMS in return to confirm and request a birthday "cake" for one. A return SMS confirmed my request. Efficient. On the day of our dinner I received yet another text to ask if we would like to pre-order to minimize waiting time. However seeing as we would be arriving at the restaurant some 20 minutes before our booking, I left it as it was. We settled in and ordered our starters of duck rilette (nice), foie terrine (heavenly), salmon rilette, ham and cheese puffs, suckling pig and iberico ham. Like vultures we descended on the food the minute it arrived and within minutes it was all gone. Two bottles of white and red wine accompanied the meal for fellow diners, my only gripe was that being the only non alcoholic in the group (allergies, unfortunate), I wasn't left with much choice and so stuck to plain water. Healthy and best, the waiter smilingly said. True. A hearty vegetable soup to share plus escargots followed before our main courses of duck confit, beef cheek, chicken, beef shoulder, beef onglet and lamb appeared at the table. Other than one diner who found her duck dry (the other duck order was fine) everyone was happy with the main course. Once the table was cleared, a birthday plate of almond butter biscuit stuffed with rhubarb compote appeared for the birthday girl. And this was followed by three servings of desert (chocolate stack with ice cream, passion fruit floating island and profiteroles) appeared for all of us to share. With coffee and tea. What I really enjoyed about the place was its unassuming ambience. We were not the most demure of diners, and even if we tried to keep volumes low, we still hushedly sang "happy birthday" like three times just so we could embarrass our friend. Our laughter was not necessarily muffled too. Unlike other pretentious places with communal tables for groups yet they will ask that you keep voices low, this bistro did no such thing and the guests there were also good natured, joining in to applaud for our birthday friend too. If this isn't unpretentious, I don't know what is. No issues with service, our orders were handled professionally (no pen not paper!) and they got most orders + placements right too. They also knew their dishes well so recommendations for portion planning and for off the menu items were great.All in, a hearty good time. We laughed and ate too much for sure. But that's a sign of a good dinner.

We made a late decision to go out for some meat, and I managed to get a table for dinner, but only outside. Luckily the evening was fine if a little toasty by the time we finished our meal, and another time - if there were another time - I would have to be inside.As with many other reviewers, you cannot fault the food: great quality of ingredients, well-prepared solid bistro fare, but the service is just not good enough when you are paying close to $200 a head.The lass doing the greeting bit is good, bright bubbly and friendly, and in general the staff are friendly and polite but they have no clue what they are doing. One guy spent the evening wandering around in a t shirt looking lost, I thought he had drifted over from SMU by mistake initially then I realised he was staff. When I sit down, I want to be offered an aperitif; to whet my appetite and give me something to play with while I peruse the menu. I had to call the waiter over and ask for one. I wanted a glass of crisp white wine, and I would have thought a restaurant with the word "sommelier" in its name would have such a thing. The waiter told me they had a choice of two: fairly obscure wines from Languedoc as far as I could work out but he had no idea what grapes the wines were, what they might taste like, or indeed whether they were dry or sweet. I chose one at random, it was just OK, more medium than dry and if I knew what it was, that would be handy as I would not choose it again.I looked through the reds: to be fair there is a good selection and a decent range of prices (by Singapore standards anything around $80 can be considered reasonable!), and I chose a 2008 St Estephe at around $120, only three times what I would pay back in France, so a bargain. It was a very good wine and worth a note in my little wine book.The main reason for choosing the place was however the cote de beouf, which we had tried at the previous incarnation and wanted again. With this in mind we shared a starter, a very good boned quail salad with liver vinaigrette, and more than enough for two.We had a decent wait for the main event, which was fine; watching the world and cars go by and having a leisurely chat with the missus. I had been out all week on business dinners so it was nice to chill out together (as well as I could while gently sweating under the stars).The beouf arrived with a big bowl of salad and a small Dauphinoise, and smothered in a kind of shallot jam and garlic confit. We leapt into action and demolished it quite quickly. To my mind it could have done with a bit more salt but unfortunately the salt police had been at work in the kitchen so we just asked the waiter for some.By the time we finished the meat I was getting really warm, and neither of us could manage a desert so we just ordered up the bill, and I went to the WC. As others have mentioned, there is one, a unisex toilet for at least the whole ground floor and outside area. I hopped about waiting while the current incumbent completed their performance, getting in the staff's way as they tried to go about their business, really not a great way to end the experience. I just don't understand how Singapore can think such inadequate toilet facilities are acceptable, but I guess such things take up valuable space where you could squeeze another table for paying customers.All in all, a mixed evening. On the one hand, a good meal, a good bottle of wine. On the other, pretty average service, toilet deficiency and getting very sweaty, and on the third a bill for close to $400.I am just not sure I would do it again, which is a pity, as it could be very good

We managed to secure a 9pm reservation for a table of 6 on a Saturday night in this hard-to-book restaurant. Started the evening in the bar area upstairs, with a recommended bottle of rose champagne that was dry and delicious, great suggestion by the bar tender, and a terrific start. The food here is really very good - honest, true-to-genre French bistro food, and the servings are more than generous so keep that in mind when you order. We very much enjoyed several of the specials, especially the fresh white asparagus flown in from Germany - seasonal and a rare sensation in Asia. We all shared tastings of our main courses: fall-apart tender lamb, roasted with herbs and garlic; a very traditional rabbit cassoulet; and beef, all of which were grand. If I was rating the restaurant just on the food, it would certainly rate a Very Good at least. But the service left something to be desired. I can't understand why so many Singapore restaurants can't grasp the rhythm of serving drinks with a meal. Here's how it goes: offer water or pre-dinner drink when you sit down. Take the wine order. Pour the wine before the appetisers arrive. Top up the wine if needed when you serve the appetisers. Check on wine order before main course arrives. Ensure all guests have wine when they are having their main course. It's really pretty straightforward. In a restaurant like this, the pairing of food and wine is a crucial element of the overall experience, and if I were the chef, I'd be pretty annoyed that my guests were missing out on the pleasure of enjoying a carefully-chosen wine with food. Although we ordered wine at the same time as the meal orders, 2 of our group were served our appetisers well before the bottles arrived. When they did arrive, after everyone's appetiser had appeared and were already being eaten, the bottles were plonked down on the table and left unopened. We had to ask 2 different passing waiters to please open them. By the time they were opened, we'd more or less finished our appetisers. At least we managed to have some wine with our main courses. We topped up our glasses ourselves throughout. I also thought the waiter could have warned us that there are no vegetables or greens served with the main meals and suggested we order a side serving of vegetables. We did this when the main courses arrived. Aside from this, the staff were personable and friendly. One final point: for a restaurant with seating for around 38 people downstairs, there is only one toilet, and it's unisex. I really dislike this trend of unisex toilets in restaurants and clubs, and think that just one being shared by 38 men and women, is not really up to standard in a restaurant where you will be paying over $150 per head for 2 courses plus wine. There were queues all evening, and you end up hanging round waiting right outside the kitchen, getting in the way of the staff coming in and out. In summary? Excellent food but service and amenities are letting them down. Could be great

Everything about this place points to the fact that the owner is very opportunistic and wants to make max $$ in shortest time possible. Let me explain:1. they dont allow you to bring your own wine, even if you pay cockage OR buy a bottle from them, then consume a second bottle of your own! And their wine starts from S$100++, which is ok if they are all expensive wines but some of them i see are just with ridiculous mark up (100% at least!!)2. some of the supposedly nice dishes has a min 2 pax order, e.g. pork chop costs S$156 for 2 pax, but that's what you need to pay if you want to eat pork in this place!!!!3. there are 2 seating in this place for dinners during their busy nights, so they keep chasing you to order and return the table (i can agree with this if prices are cheaper and points 1 & 2 above does not hold...... )4. Food is really average. Soup is nice, nothing fantastic! The roast pork however was a real disappointment. Slightly red on the inside, hard and hardly any flavour!!! The only item that was nice was white asparagus, but that due to the asparagus, not the chef
4
I went for dinner with a group on a business dinner. We have ordered beef (medium) which came cut in slices. But the one of the meat pieces was really still rare and the other one more than medium. The side dishes were quite special and very French.The staff was okay. Not great - not bad. And the athmosphere in the restaurant itself deserves not more than 3.5 stars in my opinion.It is a good place, but really, there will be loads of other restaurants that I will be visiting in Singpore first, before I go back there
5
I do not understand what the people are looking for when they are going to a restaurant. I have travelled often to France over the last 20 years and I think a fair bit over French food. When I read the reviews and when I compare with what I had, I think there is a serious problem with guys writting reviews on tripadvisor. I had a fantastic meal with a quail salad follow with veal trotter stuffed with sweetbread. The wine selection is probably one of the best in Singapore. The little Philippina girl on the floor was fantastic. That is my dream restaurant
3
Looked up the address on google maps, and they haven't updated their details. Took a cab to their old location in Prinsep street. Couldn't get another cab on busy Friday night, so walked 20min to the new location. Really need to update google maps, this must happen to many people. I was expecting a more intimate atmosphere. We dined outside in the garden by candle light, but something was missing, it lacks charm somehow. The food was OK. A small menu of traditional French country food, looked inviting. I ordered the roast chicken, my husband ordered the rabbit stew. Both were fine, just a little bland. The chicken dish was a little fatty for my taste. Frites very good. I asked the sommelier to recommend a medium-bodied wine, and he gave us a very light wine. All in all fine, but won't hurry to return
5
Rillettes, foie gras, perfectly cooked onglet steack-frites, amazing wine list with highly knowledgeable sommeliers. What more do you need?
3
Have been there several times, from when they were at Prinsep and now at Armenian Street. So on busy nights, which are usually Fridays- Sundays, service can be slow. Food has always been great. Great selection of wine.
4
I did my usual second guessing about choice of restaurant but we are all glad that everyone ignored my inner voice. This place was recommended by a local colleague who happens to be French - in his words "we have never been disappointed here". Of course hat might just mean that they start with low expectations...We sat outside in a section between the main building and a lovely park. As a couple of negative reviews mentioned it is bounded by a 3 lane road but whether it was quiet being a Monday night but we thought it was fine, certainly not noisy. Service was very good throughout, informative when needed. And a great recommendation on the wine (and certainly not upwelling me).On the wine, like all of Singapore, the markups are excessive compared to Australia and even other Asian cities. Having said that they had an excellent selection, predominantly French, but some notable exceptions.Now the food. They make their own wide range of charcuterie and it looks fabulous. We shared a rabbit, tomato and basil terrine - delicious. Served with some green salad and lovely fresh baguette (wherever they gt their bread from it is very good).Two of us ad the chefs cut which was boeuf tongue, braised in a mustard sauce and new potatoes. Very good. Lyn had the whole roast NZ red gurnard with sweet red pepper vinaigrette and arugula jelly and lemon (and dill). Excellent. The side order of mash was heart stoppingly good.Finished off with a good espresso. Desserts looked very interesting but we were full.An excellent recommendation from JL and quite reasonable at about $100 per head.
2
We went for our anniversary and even though the food is good, they have a terrible service. We think it is because they should hire more waiters, but yet the gentleman who greets at the door never smiles either. We asked for two glasses of Champagne and we were surprised that being a french restaurant, they poured the Champagne in regular wine glasses not in flutes. It was very busy, so we felt they were rushing us. Food is very good, but when we go out for a special occasion, we expect good food and good service too
3
My Idea of taking someone out to dinner is to enjoy the meal together. The quality of the meal was good, but this is as far as it went. One of my guests and I got our main meal served and my wife and the other guest just sat there and watched us eat and long after we finished the other mains arrived, then we sat there and watched them eat. For the price we paid, I was expecting first class service and clearly this was not there.My wife asked a passing waiter several times about the outstanding meals and all we got was a mumble about a problem in the kitchen.I emailed the owner Max and he said that he was going to investigate, I am still waiting for the outcome. Ah well c'est la vie and no more business from me!
5
The restaurant recently moved to a different location: now the outside dining area is even nicer and more relaxed. We always thoroughly enjoy our eating experience here. Nicely run restaurant with bistro area on 2nd floor and a counter to take away the homemade delicacies. We’ll definitely come back when in Singapore
5
Having heard so much of Le Bistrot du Sommelier, my hubby and I decided to try the restaurant with friends on a Friday evening but were told they were full - even though we had called a week before. "That good huh?" was the response I got from my better half when I told him. So we opted for Thursday evening instead. Dinner for 6 people was for 7 pm and we were early, in fact the first diners at the place. Located at the end of a row of conserved shops in Armenian Street in Singapore, it wasn't difficult to find and I was a little gobsmacked when I entered because the ambience was quaint ... a little cramped in fact but had a "french" air about it. The food - which was what we came here for - was simply divine. We had starters of different sorts to share but the haddock served on a waffle of sorts was very delicious but the thing that took the cake was the Cuisse de Grenouilles - frogs' legs. Ok, being Chinese I am not surprised by "exotic" fare but I still get a bit apprehensive about "unusual" meat. I had little to fear because the standard statement that "frogs' legs taste like chicken" was quite true. Fried in butter and garlic, the lightly floured "grenouilles" was delicious. Not to be missed. The other two starters that I would recommend is their rillettes - there was the duck and the black chicken. We chomped away on the baguettes they served (too much in fact) but the rillettes were that good.For the mains, we order "le boeuf" - their beef done raw. The 1 kilo meat was good for sharing - something the 5 of us decided to do together with a stuffed veal with sweetmeats. One of chose fish instead - grilled (I can't remember the type) but she only nodded approvingly throughout the course - a testimony to how great it tasted. What I liked particularly about the beef was the caramelised onions served as a topping. Yums! After packing away all that food - we were stuffed but could not say "no" to their desserts. There were profiteroles, creme brûlée, and poached pear that were whisked to the table. All recommended for those with a sweet tooth. We walked away from the meal - happy and we are now planning for our next visit - soon
3
The new spot for the Bistrot du Sommelier is nice with a bit of a side garden that lends itself to a slightly quieter atmosphere than busy streets. Enjoy coming here for good French food. Great beef selection. Very classic French menu, variety of meats, but do not expect to find chicken. Classic desserts. Found that the night that we went that they were 'out' of many options, not sure how often that happens but it changed our order a few times. The service was fine, nothing fantastic
4
This is a great restaurant for a large party. The atmosphere is relaxed, noisy and welcoming and the food is big and tasty.The delicious home made pates, cheeses, terrines and breads alone are enough to fill you up, but when you see the menu of mains - roast lamb, big juicy steaks and healthy free range chickens, you will manage to make room for a little bit more!The wine is all based on availability and the maitre'd will be able to make an excellent recommendation to your taste, it is all fairly priced.We would recommend this restaurant for a group night out, there is no snobbishness about the food as we find in other Singaporean-French restaurants, you will leave full and satisfied
5
I have been to Le bistrot several times now. They are consistantly prrforming very well, staff is great, food i fantastic and the wine selection is also pleasing.If you after a very nice meal for a decent price and a good atmosphere this is the place
2
I hate to leave a negative review, but this was terrible. Unprofessional service, soupy mushroom ravioli - and disorganized - prepare to wait to be greeted, and for your food. This is not a French restaurant, it's imitation. Sorry.....
2
We booked a table, and when we arrived, they wanted to install us outside, but what they called a terrassé, is the sidewalks at the back of the restaurant with no light and next to a very busy Road! So we said that we booked a table inside and then the owner told us it was fuul even if we booked so instead we went to another french restaurant in Singapore where the fond was very good, Tarrata Bistrot
5
We really thoroughly enjoyed everything - not too pretentious, not too formal but with a clear statement that Le Bistro du Sommerlier takes dining very seriously. We particularly loved the rilette, pate & terrine so much that we went back again after a film one night for our second dinner. Having lived in countries where spreads and charcuteries are part of our every day staples, we've become very picky when it comes to our basic French bites. We've been looking for good rilette and pate in Singapore for a while and haven't found it at the stores, but then to find it at a great restaurant at relatively reasonable prices (no more or less than we would pay at a decent grocery store!) we were utterly in love. This is perfect for an afternoon snack, pre-dinner nibbles or late night drinks snacks - highly recommended
5
The move to their new premises in Armenian Street has not lessened the atmosphere of this restaurant,or its excellent cuisine,and has added the option of sitting outdoors.We chose outside as it was a cool evening,and Armenian Street is a pleasant and not too traffic-intensive area.The indoors area can be a bit noisy and is not naturally sound insulated.We shared a starter of frogs legs with salad:the portion was large and the taste excellent.For main course I had a special dish of hare stuffed with foie gras,and it was really a dish to die for...My companion had guinea-fowl wrapped in cabbage,also very tasty and interesting.The rhubarb tart we shared (this is a restaurant where the portions are very generous) rounded off the meal satisfactorily.The wine-list is well-rounded,with good choices from the lower-priced (we went for a light Pinot Noir from Savoie) through to more expensive wines,with some interesting choices.The service was friendly and attentive,but not over-attentive.This meal was in such contrast to a new "nouvelle cuisine" restaurant I visited recently in Chinatown,where the food was over-priced and under-suppled.I cannot recommend 'Le Bistrot du Sommelier" highly enough
4
I visited this restaurant on a weekday for lunch. Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I found the service reasonable and friendly - the waitress was very ready to recommend the popular and more special items on the menu.Try the rilettes for starters. We tried the rabbit meat which was pretty good - it comes with bread and small cucumbers. The steak dish as well as the veal brisket are good choices.For dessert, the creme brulee is not too bad, but the most popular item seems to be the profiteroles - hazelnut ice cream with almonds and chocolate.FYI: their reservation list usually fills up very, very quickly for dinners. But on the other hand, the lunch menu is more limited, with a wider variety of choices on the dinner menu
2
I know it's a bit cliched to use the words French and arrogant in the same sentence but it's unavoidable in this instance. Just two examples, if you insist:1) My wife and I were the first to arrive. We walked in the door and there was no one willing or available to greet us. Then a guy comes running down the stairs, looks at us and proceeds to pass us by without uttering a syllable. I just said, "hello, do you work here?" He just says yes with a rather bemused or perhaps perplexed look, I'm not quite sure. As he was about to continue on his way, I just told him that I was actually here for a meal tonight. Only then did he say OK. No hello, no welcome, not even I'll be right back to help you in a minute if he really was that busy!2) One of the group ordered "andouillette". Now before I get to the end of this story, I know the foodies amongst you will think we are pig ignorant not to know what it is and I won't argue with you. However, we did ask the waitress and she just said it was stuffed pork. Being a lover of stuffed pork, the poor lad ordered it. Good grief, the stink when that thing hit our table! We asked the manager what on earth it was. He simply said "but it's tripe" as in what did you expect. We told him that we had asked the waitress. He shrugged his soldiers and moved on.Other than that, some of the dishes were good now, I have to say but others were poor or average. We ordered a few bottles of wine for the group and it was like a battle to get them to serve it. I think we asked 3 or 4 times!! This epitomised the service on the whole evening...inattentive and extremely slow.To be fair, I should mention that they gave us all a free kind of prune brandy or something. I can't recall now exactly. It was nice of them to do so and it finished off the meal rather well.Overall though, I would need a fair bit of persuading to tempt me to go back

If you're craving hearty French bistro standards with a good selection of wines, Le Bistrot du Sommelier would be hard to beat. It has now moved to a new location in Armenian street from its original spot in Prinsep Street. I went with some friends after work & we were not disappointed.For starters, their rillettes served on crusty french bread with cornichons is a stellar recommendation. For mains you'd be spoilt for choice, the onglet (flank steak) with frites would be a wonderful choice as is the cassoulet ( a generous porttion that you might be unable to finish) or the chicken cooked with 40 cloves of garlic. Plenty to choose from on their wine list with lots of by the glass selections. A hearty burgundy is called for her with all the red meat!! Desserts are french standards - creme brulee, profiteroles. You'd leave fortified for the evening or the week ahead

I had enjoyed mixed experiences trying out Western cuisines in Singapore so far. Le Bistrot du Sommelier bucked the trend and turned out to be a great place for dinner. Certainly not a cheap eat, it serves authentic French food. It may not have a huge variety of dishes but you won't be disappointed if you're looking for genuine French food. I am surely coming back and would definitely recommend it for a dinner with a group of friends

Wine list is appealing but suggestions / recommendations are poor / except a lady waitress, the rest fo the staff cannot be considered really friendly / my meat was too cooked and full of fat and at that price level, this is not acceptable / final bill is really outrageous / there r far better french tables in singapore where you will be better welcome! It was my 1st and last time ther

It's quite tricky getting a dinner reservation here (on the weekends at least) - we were later informed that there is a 2 week waiting-list for a table. That must be a first for Singapore.I called up on a Friday and they could accommodate us at 6pm provided we vacated the table at 8.30pm.Due to the rain we were forced to have an indoor table. The decor is pleasant enough and we were seated next to a lovely map of Bordeaux. Love the wine-glass 'chandeliers'. Also love the menus which have been recycled from old wine crates.The place has a very casual feel about it. Even the sommelier was walking about in a T-shirt.The food was above average although I've had much better cote-de-boeuf: this was drowned in garlic and onion. In better restaurants the chef will present the cut at the table prior to cooking it. The bill came to just over $500 (for 2 pax). That included two decent (but nothing special) bottles of wine. My girlfriend and I shared a starter and shared a main.The wine list is underwhelming. It seems confused, with wines from different countries and different years all lumped together under a price range. Their Bordeaux are unaffordable and from weaker vintages.And there is a strict no BYO policy. This is stark contrast to Bistro Du Vin which has a good wine list and where they will happily waive corkage

Commend this place. Ask the owner to decide everything for you, he knows best.

Sitting inside was cool but the service and atmosphere was really warm and welcoming. A number of bistro favourites on the menu, well prepared accompanied by a broad nough selection of wines to make this a good mid range dining experience.

Over and over, it is the feeling of "home coming"when going back to this great, cozy and friendly bistro. Great food, friendly service and excellent wines is all you need. And that is exactly what is awaiting for you at Le Bistrot du Sommelier.

Chef Patrick does great hearty French country food.
Love the roasts, and steaks.
Excellent selection of wines.
Other restaurants seem to be copying their style.
Always crowded. You have to book.
You can park at Sunshine Plaza.

I have been three times and enjoyed every morsel, item worth mentioning is that at lunch time they provide a limited menu, beef only, so not great for vegetarians. I have been for business and pleasure and all those entertained have loved it too. Service can be a bit hit and miss but that is purely to how busy they are, more asking a couple of times for another bottle of wine rather than rudeness or really bad service. For Singapore the prices are reasonable for those outside it may be a bit on the pricey side, but a lot of the produce is flown directly from France, and it worth every penny

It felt like being in France, the decor, the menu, the french staff... It is all about simple but good food, including some french classics. Truth said, my "onglet echalottes" is probably the nicest I have ever eaten including in my home country, France. I was recently joking that the ONE thing I have finally identified has impossible to find in Singapore was artichoke (fresh), but here you go, straight imported from britanny and served the French way with a delicious seasoning! The atmosphere is great, just nice and simple, not pretentious. A great restaurant for an enjoyable night

after a really excellent first time experience with fantastic recommendations from the French lady Manager or owner and very good wines, I took my girlfriend for an anniversary dinner booking inside as I perceived that to be more interesting for a tete-a-tete. Unfortunately we had to wait outside for a while. To kill the time we went through the menu with one of the waiters, but was missing the style and simple recommendations from the managers. Although the food was as good as usual, my girlfriend didn't get the right advice and ended up with something she didn't like. On the whole we were still happy as we enjoyed ourselves. The Manager took care of not charging the wrong starter so no bad feelings, but for next time make sure u do have a quick chat with one of the manager before u decide on yr menu. enjo

If you are looking for down to earth very good country style French food you can't go past this place. The combination of Chef Patrick's menu and Max's wine list is unmatched in Singapore, and easily beats most of the high end and over priced restaurants in Singapore. If you are willing definitely feel free to allow Max to serve up the best options for the day, he knows his stuff is always interested in your tastes and overall experience and will go out of his way to enure you have a great dining experience. After many visits we always go with the daily special, not once disappointed and definitely speak ask Max about the best wine to accompany the meal.The restaurant has recently moved and am yet to experience the new setting. If anything Ike the old, it will be very accommodating, pleasant and friendly and the staff are genuinely focused on ensuring you enjoy your experience and have you come back time and time again - a pleasant contrast to many other restaurants around the island

We started upstairs in the buzzy Bar, nice atmosphere, interesting room and a good crowd, only drawback was the air-conditioning which was either struggling or not working. We had a bottle of champagne and pate to share before dinner, very nice appetiser to the evening. Moving downstairs to the average dining room we ordered main meal. 6 of us at the table and 6 orders placed, I reconfirmed he had written down 6 orders. 30 minutes later 5 meals arrived, we waited and after 5 minutes called the waiter to ask on the final meal, 5 minutes later he came back and said it wasn't ordered and if we'd still like to order it, it would take another 30 minutes, no apology, no reasoning given. At no point was there any common sense or good judgement of any customer service uses. The menu is average, the service less than average and dissapointingly poor value. We won't return

We went there on a Saturday night and were seated outside. Luckily it wasn't too hot that night, because there's no ventilation or fans outside. First surprise was that didn't have any Pastis, Pernod or Ricard because the taste is too strong for the wine later, they said. So we went for Kir Royal, which was served in wine glasses, but a little bit too sweet. Then we had Duck Rillette and Escargots, both very nice. For the main we had the Steak au Poivre and the Cassoullet. The steak was excellent, one of the best I've ever had. Super tender and exactly medium rare. It came with real mashed potato. The Cassoullet was also very nice with beans, duck, sausage and pork belly, but in the end we were just too full to finish it. After 2 digestive, Poire Williams and Prune, we were ready for bed. At the end we paid ca. 200 SGD, which is very reasonable compared to most French places in Singapore. If you love French country food or want to have an excellent steak, it's the perfect place to go. Not to forget the wine, a very fruity and light Languedoc for 88,-$

I gotta say the food was ok, but definitely too much waiting for it. Almost 2 hours.
Most likely will try other places before thinking on coming back.
Choose their duck.

Let Max and his staff take care of your every whim. As authentic as it comes. Have the fabulous mains or simply pig out on the starters. Let them assist you also with their fabulous and well priced wine list.

Ate there with 3 friends for the first time. The wait staff was helpful, patient and polite. The menu is not extensive but sufficient. It has rustic French fare which is a gem to find in Singapore. We had 3 starters and were so full that we barely touched our mains, which was an excellent beef. I will be back

A great small French restaurant offering quality dishes accompanied by good wines. The wine is best chosen by the sommelier. They are busy so some patience with the service is recommended. On our last 3 trips we have made a point of having at least one meal at this restaurant trying several different dishes. Have never been disappointed. The bonus is that the prices are reasonable

What a great restaurant. We had a lovely night, we ate like Kings and drank lovely (not too expensive) wine. First we ordered the house special of cheese fondue which was delicious. This was large enough and rich enough to share between three. We then had the beef cheeks, welsh lamb stew and the cassoulet. The cassoulet was the winning dish, it was so tasty with pork, duck, lamb and sausage surrounded by beans. I had the beef cheeks which was lovely, but I had food envy for the cassoulet. The cassoulet is large enough that it could be shared, and then you would be guaranteed to make it to dessert. We did share a creme brulee and it was lovely. We also shared a bottle of wine for $88 recommended by the the sommelier and it was lovely. The only thing that let the restaurant down was later in the night when the restuarant was full it took them a long time to take our order for dessert and for them to bring it to the table. Apart from that it was a great meal with a good ambience (we sat inside downstairs). We thought it was "fantastique"

Great food (had plate of patÃ©, lamb & potatoes, plate of cheese, rhubarb dessert), good wine and best of all not a posh restaurant like others French rest. in Singapore. I did not like the HUGE rhubarb dessert, but only because I don't like whipped cream and the dessert (rhubarb, ice cream, fresh strawberry and cream) was cover with it! Next time I will order without cream or try the dessert prunes) Fantastic atmosphere, casual and charming. Chef is very kind and attentive, all staff friendly and welcoming. Hided at Prinsep Place which makes it very central. Highly recommended

I've been to Le Bistrot du Sommelier quite a few times and also brought overseas friends there for dinner. Never once had it failed us! The food & wine are superb!!! You must try the roast lamb, pork cheeks (not in the menu) and chocolate profiteroles. Reservation is a must or you'll be disappointed. There's also outdoor seating for smokers

Located in a shophouse along Prinsep Street, Le Bistrot du Sommelier serves great French food at a reasonable price. The ambience is somewhere between casual-romantic and feels like a nice neighborhood place.They emphasize their wines, of which are likely good, but their food is what I consider delicious. Favorite is the beef tartar - one of the few places in Singapore where you can find this dish

I have rarely been disappointed by a restaurant as I have been tonight.After having read the critics of this website, I decided to book a table in this restaurant.As the restaurant was full, we had a table outside which in principle was OK but just in front of the road was not a great place for a date. :-(It started with a really bad wine which our server said was fine according to her boss. We then ordered our food but the 1st starter arrived 50 min later which is amazing when you order a salad and a pate ( 2 cold dishes). Thank God the main courses came within 10 minutes but none of the dishes was tasty. Neither myself nor my fiancee finished our food. Apart from ordering and getting the bill we didnt get much interaction with the people running the restaurant. Usually we are asked how the food during or after the meal but either everyone was really busy (it was a very late dinner though) or no one cared.Furthermore, people were smoking around and even if we complained to the waiter, it didn't seem to be any concern to them. I'm writting this review because for the 1st time a restaurant in SIngapore has totally disappointed me: the food, the service, the wine, the ambience and obviously the price.It's perhaps an exceptionally bad experience but I will never come back to this restaurant nor recommend this place to anyone

Very well situated in the heart of Singapore at Prinsep road, this restaurant is somewhat a curious mix that could satisfy people who are more for the place/ambiance than the food.What I liked:The service, very friendly and quite fastThe situation and the atmosphere of the placeWhat I disliked:As a french myself, i can tell that is not french food.Cheese plater was just robery, small pieces and so expensive!!!Small portions for entry and main coursesSome wines are very expensive compare to their original pric
