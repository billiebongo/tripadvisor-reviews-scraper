Great food, I just wanted a few little dishes, and Miharu is a local restaurants with friendly locals serving great local Asian food. Would recommend a visit if staying in the local hotels. I was at the Conrad and it's over the road!

Came here for a quick bowl of miso ramen for lunch today. No issues getting a seat straight away and service was efficient. The ramen was tasty with an egg, char siu and plenty of bean sprouts. Soup wasn't too viscous. Worth coming back.

Came back here after trying it years ago at its former location at the Gallery Hotel. Now in Millennia Walk, a little less charm and no low Japanese seating options.However they still had the Tsukemen with yuzu infused broth which I adored and still enjoyed heapz today. The noodles are thick, the broth kinda light but not boring and the egg wasn't too bad either. Only thing I could've lived without maybe were those bamboo shoots. Try have shizo gyoza too which are definitely a changeup to your regular ones

Wanted to have an authentic ramen for lunch. The Miharu full name is actually Sapporo Ramen Miharu and it is an Hokkaido style of ramen and pork and side dishes. Edamame always a staple at any Japanese Restaurant and here was very good, steamed, sprinkle of salt and freshly made. Very efficient staff, quick service and food delivered quite quickly too. Very much like Japan, fast, efficient and effective service. The restaurant is located on the outer sides of the Millenia Walk complex and there are a wide variety of other eating choices around too so if you decide last minute to do something else, you have a lot of flexibility and choice. Japanese friends all think this is also authentic tasting which is good enough for me but it was also very tasty and enjoyable. Great for lunch or dinner. They have happy hour during the week so beer and sake is greatly reduced. Highly recommend, good all round and good value too.

The ramen is quite reasonably priced. For $14+ to $16+, you can get a huge bowl of ramen. According to the manager, each bowl has 140g of ramen imported from Hokkaido and made from spring water. True enough, the ramen is very springy and the ramen with pork soup base (#13) is very tasty, not too rich. However, my friend feels that her miso ramen is a bit too salty for her taste - the restaurant actually has some clear soup for you to dilute it tp taste. Also, the chicken nanban & the yaki gyoza are quite good too.

We went there for a late lunch, based on a recommendation. The place was empty, except for a couple of tables. It was well after the lunch hour, about 40mins before the place was scheduled to close.Since the only two seater tables were right next to the occupied tables, I requested that we sit away from them at a table that could potentially accommodate four, but was set for two.They refused. We walked out, never to be back

Believe me when I say that this is the best ramen house in Singapore! This is the closest you can get from the authentic ramen from Japan. The diah are so sinple yet so sophisticated in taste. Very far from those restaurants that offer a lot of unnecessary ingredients to ramen. The price is also very reasonable. I love the ambience as well. Only thing is, it closes mid afternoon and resumes on evening. But the wait definitely worth it!

Wanted to try this place after reading a lot of good reviews of the miso based broth and their chewy noodles imported from Hokkaido in Japan. Happy to say that the place didn't disappoint. The rich miso broth hit all the right notes and the noodles were light and flavourful. They have many options but the most recommended one is Tokusen Miso Ramen. Will also recommend the same.

Service was slightly rude and inattentive, when we ordered in a group of 4, the waitress would come down and mumble the order number and expected us to remember what our number was out of a whole range of 20 ramen choices. When we didn't, she would keep nagging under her breath how it is so simple and we should remember our orders.Secondly, the soup base is super salty. (I guess that is true sapporo taste) but it was way overpowering the other ingredients and not really suited to the Singapore palate. The noodles felt too chewy and almost felt like they were not freshly made and straight out of a packet like instant noodles.Simply put, better ramen places elsewhere

By far the best ramen in Singapore. Visited for the umpteenth times. Being a ramen fan and tasted ramens in major cities of Japan, the tonkotsu miso ramen retains its pure authentic flavor and the texture of noodle blends very well with the thick and salty broth. Kudos for not adapting to a less salty broth in Singapore, retaining its pure Sapporo origins. Ippudo, santouka, ajisen are a far cry to this
