My parents came home one day with packed dinner from the Noodle Bar, excitedly telling me that JCube actually had decent food. Skeptical, I tried the salmon don that they have brought back and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their grill.A few months later and many visits to the cafe, I must say that it is one of the most value for money eateries in the Western part of Singapore.A must try if you are in Jurong
