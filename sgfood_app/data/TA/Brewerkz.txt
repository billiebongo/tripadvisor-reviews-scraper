It was a quiet evening. The staff were very attentive and polite. Huge food portion. Romantic to sit outdoor.

The standard of customer service in Singapore is pretty poor anyway, but we were not greeted by anyone, eventually got seated outside which was nice. Then told that the food wold take about

The cowboy burger was huge and taste great with the bbq sauce, pork rib was really tender and delicious as well, overall highly recommended

Went with children and friends and food was big in portion and served nicely plated. It was delicious to the last bite and certainly a restaurant we will visit again.

Had the ribs and chose mashed potatoes as the sides. The mashed potatoes were not that good but the ribs were pretty good. Also had truffle fries and it was pretty good too.

food flavor is good,better than the orchard outlet, as god as riverside point. great view, especially evenings

It started out all right. We did not have a reservation but they found a place for us relatively quickly. It’s a brew pub so it’s beer and pub food. It was my mistake to order white wine. It was bad and the waiter was cranky when I told him that. My partner ordered ‘bangers and mash’. Unfortunately the ‘bangers’ were really smokies that one puts on a barbecue. I had a salad with noodles and salmon. Not terrible but very oily salad dressing. I don’t mind paying for good food and service but this was terrible at best.

It was a Saturday when my family dropped by for a small birthday celebration. They were very nice and allowed us to bring in our own cake as many restaurants don't. It wasn't very crowded and you get an amazing view of fireworks at night. They were also very attentive and patient as I redeem multiple Chope vouchers

located at sentosa boardwalk, must walk a short distance from vivo. v hot walk from the afternoon sun. restaurant was v hot bef sunset too. i booked a table for 4, but restaurant was empty so i sat at a half-sheltered table for 6 (3x table-for-2). the resturant was almost empty but the waitors did not notice me. the expressionless slim chinese male waitor told me to shift and i said the sun was too glaring at 5.30pm. he said no, my table is for 6, so i asked him to simply shift away 1 segment of the table. he placed the menu on the table away from me. i think he was unhappy i got him to shift table. i asked for iced water while waiting for my friends to arrive and he walked away without any ok/acknowledgement. i dont even know if he heard me but he must have cos the restaurant was almost empty at that time. but another indian male waitor was v pleasant and attentive. we ordered the King burger $34++ which was ok. fish and chips $25++ came with grilled option but portion was very small. wagyu burger $28++ was ok. beer 330ml $9++ before 7pm

Nice place for food and beer. The outdoor dining area is a good place for people watching in the evening. A good place to bring your partner for special occasion. The boardwalk brings forth a good sea breeze too.

We chose the outdoor seating which was facing the sea and had a good ambience. We had the golden ale which was smooth and had a floral aroma. Nice music was played too.

The beer was great! The food was pretty good. A bit expensive price for the soba salmon salad. The potato skins were alright, though a bit overloaded with cheese.

I and my wife went to boardwalk sentosa. After the visit to sentosa we decided to go for a dinner at brewerkz at the sea side because it is beautiful place.
4
Good for couples or small groups of friends. nice night view with fireworks from sentosa. Not too crowded on a Friday night

We went with friends who had been before and recommended it, mostly because of the nice atmosphere. It was a great evening with a colourful sunset, good food and attentive service.

Good beer at an "affordable" price (considering alcohol price in Singapore). Hamburgers are very nice! Good ambience both in Sentosa boardwalk and River Point.

It is a great place to quench your thirst acquired on the boardwalk to or from the Sentosa Island.The place specializes in single hop beer which I had and really liked. The beer on tap is fresh and tastes unique. The food is also good and reasonably priced for the ambience you get in the place. You have the choice to sit out in the open air or inside the air-conditioned bar. We chose to sit inside as it was afternoon time and it was hot and humid inside.All in all, a great place to grab a beer and some food on the boardwalk

This is yet another good choice for an unplanned night out. If you have your timing right you can view the Crane-Dance show at Sentosa from your seat whilst having a nice cool beverage in your hand. The food is typical to Brewerkz, quality food, variety to chose from, enough on your plate and to drench your thirst

We visited on a Saturday- weekends they have a $20 dollar deal - salad or soup, main and pint of beer (your choice) with ice cream. Shared this as good sized serves. They initially gave us the wrong salad so that was on the house. I wouldn't have minded as we were enjoying it. A good stop for lunch before vivo city.
