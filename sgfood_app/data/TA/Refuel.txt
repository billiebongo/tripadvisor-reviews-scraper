They never fail fixing my craving! Good foods and environment with good music. Most importantly, they serve good coffee!❤️

Concept of the cafe was cool with natural sunlight. nice ambience. Been to several cafes and sadly to say, the food was average. Depend on individual likings. Portion of the food is relatively huge. Nevertheless, still a good place to chill.

Menu has since improved. Loved the pancakes (fluffy) and the pasta (cooked to al dente). Good place / cafe to chill for the east siders. To avoid long waiting time, good to reserve over the phone.

Had dinner for two person at Refuel@Jalan Bukit Merah for second time, ordered Bacon Mushroom Mac & Cheese, unfortunately the food was too salty, totally can't finish it. Btw the environment is good for relax.

As the above description the deserts are excellent. The other main dishes are also good like the ribs or salmon. Unfortunately the service needs an upgrade. The staff are either slow or they have upset faces when the crowd is pack.

Nice small place for lunch, dinner or late breakfast. Portions are pretty small, so usually it is easy to fit in also dessert. The best European/American type restaurant around Bedok Reservoir Lake. You need to wait for a table often at dinner time.

Nice ambience and friendly servers. Prices are decent and no taxes at all. Carbonara pasta tasted delicious and salmon Benedict was above average. Had banana waffles and Apple crumble for desserts which both were ok. Overall recommended. Be sure to make reservation on weekends.

We live locally and were looking for a quick, cheap meal. The place was busy which was a good sign, and we were immediately shown to a table. There wasn’t a great deal of choice for me as a vegetarian so I had to opt for a fish option and even that still had bacon too which I had to ask that they remove. My meal did still have some bacon in but it was easy to take out. We will definitely we popping back in, most likely for breakfast or brunch in future however. The options of food are quite restrictive and not a great deal of “dinner” options apart from pasta dishes.Generally a nice atmosphere and a cute little place

Visited Refuel on a Saturday afternoon with 2 kids (2 months old infant & 1.6 years old kid). Was a little worried initially of the space and whether the cafe provide baby chairs etc. The cafe is relatively small, however, when we arrived, the service staff received us with great friendly smile and without asking, took the initiative to bring baby chair & children set for the older kid. We ordered latte, mocha, Refuel ice tea and chocolate banana waffle (with extra ice cream). The coffee is above average standard, the refuel ice tea is home-made, with interesting blend of limb, orange juice and lemon. Very very refreshing with right level of sweetness. The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ice cream can be further improved as it's not very smooth. Overall experience is great. Service staff is friendly and proactive in cleaning table and meeting your needs. A good hang out place for gatherings or just yourself. Will definitely be back to try their main courses. PS: too distracted with kids that only managed to take one photo

The cafe locates at a quiet spot at the ground floor of a HDB flat close to Before Reservoir. However, the cafe doesn't has the water front view.The services are good. Due to limited seats, you can reserve on the spot then go for a walk at the reservoir. The waitress will call when the table is ready.The desert is excellent, especially their pancake. Also tried their honey BBQ rib, excellent.. Overall, this is a cafe for a relax afternoon tea with ice-cream topped pancake
