Yummy finger food but average mains, pricey too. it was interesting to have a place for harry potter team. Many interesting props available for photo taking.

The price is on the high side. But it's a fun place to go with friends. A lot of props for photo taking. However, probably just visit for experience and LOTS of photos!

I found this on facebook before my trip to Singapore and it's one of the things I wanted to go to before the end of my trip. I had the cocktail called "flaming brew" which is not only presented good but actually and surprisingly tastes good. You should try it! Staff are also social media friendly. They'll ask if you would like to take pictures or a video of the cocktail while it's got the flames. Of course they put out the flames before you get to drink the cocktail so I'd say make it worthwhile with the pictures/video while you're there. The only con is, it's hard to find! From my perspective, it's a little far and hard to find. We had to take a train and then a cab to reach this but it's totally worth the search

A Harry Potter themed restaurant with really good food. No doubt restricted by copyright they none the less put a small spin on the theme, cloaks, hats, wands, ties etc. on a rack in the corner to put both adults and children into the mood. Our party of ten started with a selection of tapas style bites, the sweet potato balls especially good. Chosen mains were mostly (huge) burgers with three ordering salmon. The salmon had a lovely surprise of vegetables hidden underneath.I would recomend Platform 1094 to anyone visiting Singapore, remember, the fun is what you make of it

I am a huge Harry Potter fan so I thoroughly enjoyed this place, this decor was amazing and is a great place for Instagram photos. They supply robes, ties, scarves, ect. so you can dress up and take photos. Staff are friendly. Flaming drink is really cool. Food is good- not the best but would still highly recommend this place to any Harry Potter fan

We reached there around 12pm..so we get seated once we reached..they started to queue up around 12:30pm..so it's lucky that we reach early..there's not much seats in the restaurant..can fit in around 30-40 pax..and there is some tables outside the restaurant.. and because of the theme,the table turn over is not that fast..coz people will enjoy their food slowly and take a lot of pictures..It just located near boon Keng mrt station..around 10 minutes walk..or else just two stops away by bus from boon Keng mrt station exit a..Overall experience are good..service are not bad too..is a good place for a Harry potter's fans to be here to take photo.

Amist the monotony of the day-to-day grind, we all crave a little magic in our lives. Fntasy seies like Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings have remained long-standing favourites throughout the years-they help us escape to a whole nes dimension. Discovering magic-inspired cafe Platform 1094 just a stone's throw from the city was almpst like stumbling upon The Three Broomstickes, in real life, if i cant be part of The Whzarding World, at least i can still dine like a Hogwarts witch. Platform 1094 brings in the homliness with warm and wood panelled walls, complete with tabletop candlez and a ceiling candelabra for magical vibes. Chairs are adorned with deer designs. Also, massive props to Platform 1094 - literally for providing a witch's hat nd even range of magic wands for photo opportunities. The customer service is also commendable -the staff were friendly and attentive towards us, and very open to feedback. Definetly worth a visit, even with the trip down to Boon Keng and 10 minutes walk from the MRT. Needless to say, i will definetly be returning for more magic to stisfy my wizardly cravings

I had read about this place on Facebook and as I love Harry Potter convinced my partner let's try it. We got there by MRT it was not hard. Now it was a quick decision to go here and we unfortunately had not booked. We had to wait an hour outside in the heat. The place is not big and was totally packed and children were having fun dressing up and taking photos. I totally recommend for children. Our meal was ok large portions. I ordered an alcoholic drink that had flames that was fun. But the best part I have to say was the dessert it was super yummy. We shared one. A nice evening but the wait to be seated being outside was unpleasantno offer of water or anything while we waited

Had high expectation of the place as it had some visually enticing photos that can be found on Instagram. Checked the place out, and was a bit disappointed as it was quite small and the restroom is located outside the restaurant, the ambiance gives you the world of Harry Potter feels but lacks something. The main attraction here is that you get to wear costumes and get that Instagram worthy shot. They also have some stuff like toys and trinkets associated with Harry Potter that you can borrow and use in a photo op. Food is okay, not that great with the price it comes with, service is good and fast but overall, I would say an average place to drop by

Hi, if you like Harry Potter movies, you should at least give this cafe/restaurant a try once. The children should love it, but as an adult, you probably have to be a die-hard fan to feel immersed in the wizardy atmosphere since there arent that many references.There are enough furnishings, and even a cupboard with props like wands and stuff for you to play around, and some fantasy themed dishes and cocktails
3
The place is too small and quite hard to find. The food is quite expensive but yummy.
Harry potter fans love the place as they kept on having pictures with robes and wands etc.
4
Food was awesome! Affordable price too.. love the Harry potter/wizard theme ! There are lots of Wands witch hat, cape owls to borrow and take picture with.. notice the staff is all guys too hahaa.. lovely place !
5
Dinner was awesome! The presentation of The Goblet of Fire drink was so fun to watch. All the kiddos in the group got to try making the "fire" which they enjoyed. They also enjoyed dressing up in the Harry Potter costumes. The duck & ribs dishes are a must eat!

Came here with high expectations and felt sorely let down. The place doesn’t seem at all like it is described. It looks like any regular café. The menu leaves nothing to be desired. Wanted to have dinner, but ended up having drinks only. The goblet of fire (drink) which I ordered is a far cry from what it's made out to be. It's supposed to light up in flames, but all I got was a small fire that fizzled out after a few seconds. Service was lackluster
3
The food was not too bad but the space is too small. The pasta that I've ordered is too dry but the taste is ok. There're customer that are taking pictures but they'll be disturbing other customers as the space for them to take pictures are too small. Customer has to get out from their seats just to let others to take pictures. This is quite disturbing.Been there once is enough, I don't think I'll be back again

For HP fans, here is a nice place to visit and enjoy the foodServing and portion is nice. Worth the price. Many suprising drinks related to wizardy world that you can tryOnly problem is the joint is too small. The wait is too long due to peole still enjoying the meal and photos taken with costumes and all...Please rent a bigger space otherwise people will grew tired of waiting and rushing to get finished the meal due to the long line of people waiting

Our kids are Potter fans & was very excited to try out this magic themed cafe. I wasn't expecting much & although I'd still tell you not to either, I'd say they've got their fundamentals right; food was good! We had their chicken salad with Quinoa, Beetroot & Carrot soup, crab pasta & burger. All nice except a little more Quinoa would be good. Some wands on display could do with some replacement & more posters & decor could add more magic.

This place is a must visit whilst in Singapore, the food was amazing and plated extremely well. Cocktails some of the best I've ever tasted.Staff were friendly and helpful only thing I could complain about would be that my meal was finished and i waited over 15 minutes before flagging down the waiter to clear the table and request desert menu's

Platform 1094 is a must visit place for all Harry Potter fans. The much hyped Goblet of Fire didn't taste that great. The service and food is just fine but expensive. The ambience is great and one can try all the props that are kept on display
4
It was good experice, i was curious about goblet of fire drink. The ambiance is nice, not too far from bus station, i waited for 5 minutes to get a seat, the staff was really nice. They have a magic wand, robes and other Harry Potter things that you can use for taking pictures. All things were good, but the price.. Goblet of fire sgd 15, latte 6 sgd, fries 10 sgd.
3
The accessories are good, but the food are not for budget travelers and i was expecting more of the vibes. But it was okay. And the food also okay.

Some concept bistro restaurant for novelty..
Food menu not very extensive.
Gets pretty crowded as the restaurant is small.
I won't queue for it....
5
cozy and very unique ambiance with lots of costumes like wands, eye wears, wardrobe etc. food also is very great. must try the goblet of fire (flaming brew).
5
We loved this place. I had the duck which was divine, and my partner had the crab linguine which he also really enjoyed. To drink we had the goblet of fire (although I can't remember the name of it on the menu - it was there secret recipe or something??) which was better to look at then to taste although it wasn't bad, and the Mojito (again it wasn't called this on the menu but I can't remember the name - it had the same ingredients as a mojito) which was really good. We also opted for desert, we had a chocolate cheesecake which was amazing. The staff were great and very attentive. They even gave us a free drink when they accidentally cleared our half drunk drink up when we went to inspect the Harry Potter costumes. They had Harry Potter music playing (theme tune, the weird sisters etc), and display items such as wands and glasses. A must to for a Harry Potter lover like myself! We booked a table and I would recommend others too as we came on a Tuesday night at 7pm and it was pretty packed with only reserved tables empty.

Blog reviews online make this place look better than it actually is. The food and drinks are average, including the signature flaming potion which tastes very ordinary for a $15 cocktail. The flames are weak and not spectacular in reality. Decor and theme is nice but not exactly Harry Potter so hardcore fans, do not expected to be impressed. it's more of 'inspired' like your knock-off inspired luxury bags

I was unable to get a reservation for the time I was in Singapore. (Recommend having one and book months in advance...) I was really lucky that I was able to tag along with a really lovely Norwegian family who had a reservation, as they were really busy and had no room for one. I of course got the Goblet Of Fire Drink - totally recommended!The food was well presented and tasted good!The atmosphere & location is what lets the place down however. Its located at the top end of "Little India" so out of the tourist area of Singapore. As a huge Harry Potter fan, I felt let down by the atmosphere. The music was just current US/UK charts, rather than music featured in the films. It lacked in character, charm and magic that you'd expect for something like this. It was almost a "normal" setting with magical foods and drinks.The staff where nice and a food was good. It was also fairly reasonably price considering the novelty of it. I know I rate harshly, but I really do think more work could be done on the atmosphere. I know the family I was with also felt the same and said they where disappointed with the background music and lack of character.I would still recommend any Harry Potter fan to try the Goblet Of Fire. Its like nothing I have tasted, seen or experienced before

I looked for this place due to the hype. Most of the hypes I went before were really cringeworthy, but Platform 1094 can deliver what is expected from them. Great concept, interesting cocktails, nice food, great staff and awesome coffees. Even without those wizard hats, I would still come back for the food and service. But I do hope that they can do an all out Harry Potter themed cafe, with butterbeers and wizard latte art designs

We went during lunch but was disappointed that desserts were only available after 3pm.The food was not impressive, duck was tough, burger was average etc. The drinks were fun but taste was not as good as the looks. I hope the restaurant would improve on the quality of their food. Maybe they could revamp the menu to cater to more comfort food types
3
We reserved a table so we didn't have to wait to get a table, there were lines forming when we left though so I would recommend booking if you can. It's about a 10 min walk from the MRT straight down the road as well so it's pretty easy to get to. The service was good and the staff were very friendly, there was also a box of costumes when you walk in which was pretty cool.The food and drinks are average which is why I gave it this score because a restaurant should still be about the food even if it is a bit of a fun. It is reasonably priced by Singapore standards though and I would recommend giving it a go if you get the chance, just for the spectacle

Visit the highly anticipated harry potter cafe with my family.. Not surprised to find a long q and have to wait for more than 1.5hrs.. I am ok with wait consider it is weekend.. We only managed to get a seat outside the resturant after the long wait so not much to comment on the ambience of the place.. Me and daughter did went inside after dinner so we are not really impressed with the setup..consider they just have a few prop for visitor to dress up.. the rest of setup looks pretty much like a normal resturants. In term of the food, the Sous vide Duck breast and Presto Mayo Pork ribs is good but the highly anticipated Globert of Fire( rename now to be Mr Lich's Flaming Brew fails to impressive.. Other than it flame like magic potion.. the taste is very disappointing..
