The beef were very fresh, prepared on demand and the chefs were skilled and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the chefs made us feel very at home. It was a great pleasure to enjoy both the food and watching them cooking the meats.

Staffs is very helpful with recommendations, explanation of all the different dishes and provide insights on how to enjoy the dishes best.

The seats are all counter seats hence not family friendly with little tots. Overall food quality is good.

Opened for lunch service recently. 4 items on the menu to keep things easy. Food was amazing, simple and yummy, just the way I like it ! Will be back !

If you are looking for quality BBQ beef with personal service, this is the place to go. However do note that the price is on a higher side.

Pork & beef were grilled to perfection by the friendly staff. Counter seats only so u can observe the whole action from seasoning to grilling. Seafood such as squid & scallops were fresh as only need simple seasoning . A must visit.

coming from korea, I've had my fair share of yakiniku,but having premium cuts grilled by personal grill chefs was an amzing experience! every dish was grilled to perfection.chefs crafted an excellent and very well balanced yakiniku feast for my party of four - different cuts of wagyu, prime were interlaced with seafood (try the sashimi grade scallops!) and seasonal veg. service was by far one of the best i've experienced in singapore. highly recommended

Read about the good reviews. Was disappointed with the visit. As many as 4 servers crowd over to take our orders. This is overwhelming especially when we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get an exceptional service.Though disappointed, I must say the only lady staff was good. She took the initiative to split the change equally. Now this is good anticipation and going the extra mile

The first BBQ restaurant that I have been to that really uses charcoal to BBQ the meat and I don't have to do it. The staff will do the job and have it beautifully done. The built in exhaust system is great too. I don't feel greasy and smelly after having food here.

Went to Yen Yakiniku for lunch recently with my friends.. they recently started lunch promo after previously only opened for dinner. Great food and nice ambience. We will be back there again for dinner soon. They have the yummiest grilled meats, and accompaniments such as seaweed salmon rice and a soupy tea ric

The food could be better to make it worth the price. Enjoyed our conversation with the chefs and gained better knowledge abt the food.
5
Amazing selection of fresh food. Highly Recommend: Short ribs, ox tongue, chicken thighs, rib eyed steak.
5
Food is simple but so tasty. Staff is also friendly and make good recommendation. Will be back again!
5
Wonderful experience! The service and food were really good and exceeded my expectations. The wagyu steak and mushrooms are a MUST try!

YEN Yakiniku only takes reservation from 6-8pm or 8-10pm. However, Chope allowed me to reserve table at 630pm and informed that my session will last for 2 hours. My family and i had to rush through our dinner and forced to leave by 8pm.
5
Sushi style counter where you order your food and its cook infront of you and served fresh. Food are delicious but abit on the expensive side. Excellent atmosphere for a date
5
Food quality is great, staff service is wonderful. Food gets grilled in front of you, cooked to perfection, served immediately! Definitely will return!
5
I went during valentine day, the chef and environm is great, have a awesome service and recommended which part of beef is tasty. They also recommends which red wine should drink when having this good stuff.
5
Wasn't expecting such authentic Japanese yakiniku at a non-Japanese owned restaurant.....these people really know yakiniku well. I can tell they are extremely particular about the meat since the staff grill every dish to perfection themselves instead of the guests doing it as per normal yakiniku. Expensive but I would say it is worth every cent.
5
One of the most mind-blowing dining experience I have had in a long while since my trip to Japan a few months back. The chefs take this business really seriously, as I see them 'rest' our wagyu to ensure that the juices are spread out evenly within after the initial cooking. You can bite into the beef and feel it tear away easily--the meat is that tender. Not to mention the service was excellent! The chefs take on a scientific approach to cooking each piece of meat. The precision and dedication is amazing. Kudos to the chefs

Seating capacity is limited as probably as such the "personalised" service was given an excellent. Food was ok only. Rather salty thou
5
The food was yummy and service was great too. Worth going. Price reasonable. Recommended. If there is special for birthday or any other celebrations. It would be great.
5
Highly recommended as they explain and make suggestions. You can also watch as they prepare the food.
5
One of the best beef I've had. heir wasabi sauce is really good. Try the butter corn and japanese yam, exceptionally flavorful.
5
Been here more than I would expected initially. Great ambiance of you want to have quality food and service
5
Food is Excellent... and the service is good overall a nice dinner but the price is high but that is because they are using excellent meat.

The decor was sleek but the wait staff requires more training and the food wasn't great. Japanese grill is not just putting pieces of meat on a wire mesh. It takes skill to make sure the grilling comes out good. I could have done a better job of grilling food! Wouldn't go back. Not a good food experience.

I came here as two couples (my husband and I + brother and his gf) for Christmas Eve.I received a phone call earlier in the day to confirm the reservation which was fine, as they stated they would seat us at the corner so it is easier for us to converse, since they only have counter seats. I thought that was kind for them to confirm. However, upon arriving at the restaurant, they seated us in the center, where it was not easy for us to converse. I had to argue with them a bit to get them to seat us appropriately as they promised.The meat and seafood selection was very limited, which I was already disappointed about as I glanced over the menu. But more disappointing was the serving size. Essentially we paid $4.5 for a single slice of ox tongue per person, for which I asked for them to cook it more since I am pregnant, but they only slightly cooked it more, and the guy twinged with reluctance when I asked. We paid $15 per scallop per person, which was the worst tasting scallop I have ever had. It was also so raw that even my husband had to ask to cook it better. The meats all tasted good, but did not quite hit the mark. I have had better at Yazawa or other restaurants. Cons (overpriced and poor service):-Seaweed salad (lettuce and seaweed) and Yen's special salad (cabbage and tofu) are way overpriced for what it is. -Asparagus was delicious, but we essentially paid $4.7 for each spear of asparagus-Meat selection is limited and portions ridiculously small-Poor service from some of the male waiters-Small scoop of ice cream for $6 was a shockPros: -Meat was decent in terms of taste-Kimchi was delicious-Good Ice cream flavours (sesame flavour, earl grey tea flavour, green tea flavour, yuzu sorbet flavour)Overall, I would never come back here again, nor would I recommend this to anyone

You will read the other reviews that think that this may be harsh but we did not have a good experience here. Let me say though that the beef itself is not bad (its out but not standout) but it is really the service that is horrible. You get staff telling you they don't have condiments (when they do) as they don't want you use it with the food (that's fine but be upfront about it) There is lots of backtalk behind customers backs. The portions here are not large and it is not like your usual yakiniku restaurant (they cook for you behind a bar). I was really looking forward to trying this place as I have seen it as a sponsored ad on facebook - well at least I have been so can tick it off the list

First time visiting this place, pretty nice cushy ambience however the meat was rather pricey, probably more worthwhile to go to Yazawa instead. Loved the special Yen salad though, unique. Service had an added personal touch because the meat are grilled by the staff and was not as I had expected
4
Food was fresh and delicious, although it was a little pricey. Staff was very friendly and explain the origin of the food.
5
In my opinion this is the best yakiniku restaurant in Singapore. Excellent cuts of beef coupled with attentive service makes it an enjoyable experience each time i visit. Highly recommend the ox tongue and the short ribs.
3
The price of the food and beverage were high and not worth the money spent.
Portion of the food was pathetic and was hesitate to place more order.
Service was average though
5
Everything was great! Especially the ribeyeüëçüèª a must order!
Service crew were constantly checking if we were enjoying our food and giving sufficient information about the meat they were grilling for us.
4
Almost everything was cooked to perfection except the scallops which they gladly replaced for me. Will definitely go back! Good service too :)
5
For our dinner, we let the staff decide for us the items to order and the service was prompt and friendly. The beef served were fresh and they know exactly how best to serve it. i.e. Should it be done well, medium rare or medium. I'm told that if they overdo the beef, on their own accord, they will give you another serving. My friends and I also liked the sake bottles that we ordered and the overall experience Ion the restaurant was very enjoyable.
3
I brought 3 friends along and all felt that even though the meat is very tasty to their recommended doneness of the meat but it's sliced so thinly and each of us only get to have 1 or 2 thin slice. We ordered almost 9 dish but all felt like appetizer and very pricey. In the end we had to go to another restaurant and have 2nd round
4
It was a very pleasant night we spent. The food quality was excellent! For meat, we ordered waygu beef oyster blade, ox tongue and 2 types of beef ribs, all were excellent. Staffs were super friendly and attentive. The whole experience was great. The only minus point was the price. While it is completely understandable on the pricing (expensive part of town and imported meat), it's definitely not a place you go for a weekday dinner. The food was well worth the spent in Singapore, but similar quality of meat in Japan or Taiwan would be a fraction of the price.
4
A very cozy and personalised dinner... the staff (chefs?) will grill the orders in front of you and even make recommendations on the done-ness of the beef and what sauce/ condiments to go with so that the full falvour can be experienced. A very unique experience though it was on the high side in terms of price.. There are good selections of sakes and wines to go along.

We are impressed with the quality of beef and also the service to grill it to perfection. The yen special salad was a refreshing opening to the dinner. The A4 grade steak, beef blade and ox tongue are must tries. It was not crowded hence it was comfortable.
