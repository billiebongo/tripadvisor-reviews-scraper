Cosy place, with many Japanese customers, he had Tonkatsu set, Japanese breaded and fried pork cutlet served with a sweet and savory sauce. Quite a big piece, which is value for money. I had Tempura Udon. Fresh ingredient.
Will be back soon.

I went here with a fiend for lunch and ordered the chicken karaage set. Delicious and very generous portions. You can easily share this meal. The pickled veg were excellent. Good lunch spot.

The Sushi and Sashimi menu was rather small, but taste and price were ok. The presentation of the food (soup plates!) was not typical japanese and though a little disappointing.
Nice place for sitting outside.

This is one of my top places for lunch whenever I'm craving for Japanese Cuisine.
Upon stepping in you'll realize most of the customer are Japanese.
They have a large variety for their lunch menu. The portion here is quite big.

Service was great and polite....just typical of a natural Japanese run eatery. The Tori Katsu set was nice but the steak set was a bit tough on certain pieces because of the tendons. Overall still enjoyable.

We had the sashimi platter, mackerel and salmon here from the lunch menu. It really didn't taste that fresh. Won't be rushing back. The highlight was the green tea!

Beer is cold and the tea is hot. This place is consistently full of Japanese business men and the menu is reasonably priced. Staff are friendly and it is easy to get in and out.

The test for a good or great authentic japanese restaurant esp. is to see how many japanese eat ! Of course there are exceptions like Nobu (but that s fusion!)The place is filled with japanese diners so it gotta to be good and authentic ( how many of jap would go to sakae sushi etc - answer : virtually 0 ) Fairly reasonable prices at Stanley street as rent here is cheaper than in 5 star hotels, hence no exorbitant prices i enjoyed my meal here and would came back again as their menu caters for japanese.if they were only 'so so ' this restaurant would be empty /closed long ago!i had the fried octopus tentacles and it was crisp , also some sushi. However the tempuro udon is nothing memorable . Pictures in the menu did not match the menu on same page. Leaves you to figure out as in jigsaw puzzle

Cozy, laid back place patronised by many Japanese. My friend and I were the only non japanese. We had a sashimi platter, oden which was very wholesome and agedashi tofu. Didn't like the batter on the tofu as it was too stretchy. Reasonably priced place and attentive staff make this a place I might visit again

Came to the new premises in Stanley St today for lunch. I tried one of the set menus with a slice of fish whilst my friend opted for the unagi. Both were pretty decent and reasonable value. Service was reasonably efficient and the place seemed quite popular. No reservations, but didn't seem to be a problem getting a table shortly after 12 on a Friday
