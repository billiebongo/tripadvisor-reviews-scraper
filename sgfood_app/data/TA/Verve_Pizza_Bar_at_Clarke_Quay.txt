Their staff is polite and ask us to wait for another 10mins coz the place was packed on Eve of PH April 30.Sanjeev took us our order with our favorite Barzini good to match with beer. We will come back always for sure.

The pizzas at this restaurant were very tasty and freshly prepared. Thin, crispy base so you could enjoy the flavours of the pizza. Not cheap, however restaurants in this area are all pretty expensive.

The place is crowded but with a good glass of signature mojito and an excellent pizza, what could go wrong? Try the pizza with ham. Mid-range budget and it is worth it.

On a busy night we dropped in for a pizza, and service / promptness was 100%.
Appeared very alert to customer experience in a competitive position, and pizza was great, thanks.

I became aware of Verve Pizza through a location near where I used to live, which is no longer open. So when I saw this one at Clarke Quay, I gave it a try.It's Clarke Quay, it's going to be expensive. If you can live with that, and have a need for late night pizza and wine, this place will do just fine. I have often gone late at night, when I haven't already had a chance to get something to eat, and order a combination deal of a pizza with two glasses of wine, then sit with the food, drinks, and my computer, get a bit of work done, and watch the late night world to go by. Usually I have another glass or two after.I have learned to check the grated cheese container before pouring, as on two separate occasions, the lid came right off and half the jar poured out onto my pizza. I also had a bit of a problem here, which is not really the fault of the establishment, although perhaps they could have done something once the situation developed - a lone diner late at night of the male persuasion seems to attract unwanted attention from certain young ladies who are found around Clarke Quay at night. One of them is extremely persistent and hard to get rid of, and I actually avoided this place for a while because of her. But she seems to be gone, and now I'm back

Small place with less than 20 seats - GREAT THIN-CRUST PIZZA! Authentic and great texture in the crust. The pizza chef was enthusiastic about his pizza. Small menu - only pizza but worth it! Open till very late so perfect for the late night muchies. Good value too in the middle of Clarke Qua

I ordered a 12" pizza (Vegetariana) and it was about 22 SGD.There are special value packs with beer and wine or slices of pizza which were 15 SGD or so.The pizza was yum (toppings could be a bit more especially when you have a vegetarian pizza), the atmosphere okay although I cannot imagine you can talk to each other due to the loud music. Was there by myself...so I enjoyed the music :

We were a few friends enjoying a weekend evening at Clarke quay and since everything else around had no place to sit we had dinner here. Pizza was really nice and brought to us quite quickly. This place serves beer and hard liquor as well but like most places in Singapore this was a bit steep.

Good pizza, made fresh on the spot, and didn't take too long to arrive. Tasted pretty good, although lacked a little in toppings. Well priced, and a good selection of different pizzas. The staff were attentive, but seemed annoyed with having to deal with people who just wanted a pizza without all the beers and booze

Too expensive and below expectation. I don't recommend to have pizza here in Clarke Quay. Better to try other places..

I am a vegetarian and they were able to get me a suitable pizza for me. But otherwise they have a good range of options.

The Pizza's were OK, but they were ridiculously expensive. A little of a tourist trap. Service was good and quick.

Found this bar by chance while in Clarke Quay. Great vibrancy to the place. Food and drinks good too, particularly the cocktails. A fantastic place to watch the world go by, drink and have good food,. the live band is great too. What's not to like - Go!

This is one of the hundreds of bars and eateries of Clark Quay. Nothing exceptionally different but there is something good about the staff team at this outlet and the way they serve guests.Pizza tastes good and drinks are served in good speed but what actually makes one feel good here is the service of the team. Loud as it is meant to be, there's good music always playing.When you walk into Clark Quay, don't skip this one.

Went to this place once, it's a great place to hang out with friends. The pizza was good, and lots of choices of beverages. The ambience was also good. Staff was helpful and friendly as well. The price was a bit expensive though, but apart from the price, everything was good

There was a giant disorder among the waiters ; people came after us and finished before we were served.One of us was served within 15 minutes, the 3 others waited nearly two hours.The manager apologized, explaining that there was not enough waiters. That explains waiting a long time but does not explain being served in a random order.As a compensation, the manager proposed complimentary dessert OR complimentary dessert. We chose complimentary dessert.I was expecting the menu, or at least some choice.We had no choice and the waiter brought 4 small ice creams, with 4 different perfumes.End of the story.

We normally reside in the Penny Black, but Harry's next door has had a recent refurb. The staff were exceptionally attentive, the food was good and varied. Considering its in a tourist hot spot, they certainly do there very best to keep you happy. Staff very engaging

If you want an authentic, thin'n'crispy pizza in a casual environment, go for it. Much better pizza than most of he Italian restaurants. Clarke quay isn't a cheap place, but this was good. Pizza and two beers for around Â£17. No different to Sevenoaks. Probably cheaper.

We had just arrived in Singapore and staying next to Clarke quay. The pizza was tasty and quick . In a a way it reminded me of a New York pizza bar
5
Awesome tasting food with brilliant combo packages of Pizza & Beer. The ambiance is equally awesome with outdoor sitting & scores of specialty restaurants lining up both the sides of the lane. A must visit place on Clarke Quay.

This pizza is really good for thin crust pizza fans! I went or eat a slice (7s $) after drinking and it was very good and tasty. Also quick.
But in Singapore like in Singapore. .. expensive

We stopped here while walking around Clarke Quay. 2 cans of drink, 2 bottles of water, 2 scoops of icecream. $32.
Enough said!

Few weeks ago, instead of dining out with the kids we decided to order a pizza and enjoy it watching a good movie.Well... excellent idea you would say, and you would be right. But this is without taking into account the time it takes to be delivered. After calling their service desk and orderding 2 pizzas, they announced that delivery time is maximum 2 hours !! We thought they were joking, but.... no they were not. We decided anyway to order them as it was starting to be late and nobody willing to go out, betting that we could enjoy those pizzas within 45mn. But indeed, it took 2 hours to be delivered. Needless to say that pizzas were cold, and kids hungry and sleepy ! We obviously did not enjoy eating those cold pizzas and had to postpone our movie night to next day ! We had very nice home made popcorn !!! Hot and on time for the movie

We were unlucky enough to order a pizza here and soon realised that it was the most plain and boring tasting pizza that I have ever tasted. I regularly enjoy good wood fired pizzas at home and am happy to pay $25 - $30 for a decent pizza.I wouldn't have minded but it cost me $27 after service and GST (17%) for this privilege. If anyone thinks these pizza's tastes great then they obviously haven't tried many decent pizzas.If the pizza was of a high quality I wouldn't have minded but this doesn't even come close to even a fast food Pizza Hut chain pizza although it did compare with size.This is far too expensive for what they served. If you want pizza, try somewhere else it wouldn't be hard to beat this place. We left extremely hungry and unimpressed

The pizzas are good, well cooked and ingredients are ok.Personnell is a bit low cost.The price: you pay location and Clarke Quay area: 2 pizzas and 2 soft drinks 60S$.All prices indicated GST is not included. Only area in Singapore.... Why ? So you buy more and realize later prices are higher....Could be better.Good point: open until late. Midnight and after

While in Singapore we had a drink in this place, we were grossly over charged for 2 alcoholic ginger beer 32 $d that is equivalent to Â£17.00. There were other drinks advertised @ $d 14 for 2 drinks. What a rip off when tackled the waiter just shrugged her shoulder as if it was nothing

This is one of my favorite place for the pizza, every time I had better experience here for food as well as for the varieties of drink , I am pretty impress with this place and the overall experience , looking forward to visit soon to try something different again :)

Verve serves up some very tasty pizza and when paired with the right beer you have yourself a winner.I tried a couple of different type of pizza slices, both were tasty and well made. Often you will find thin crust pizza burned but everything I tried was cooked well with no black char on the underside.They have a busy area with constant people moving out front of your tables so it's a good place to relax but still feel like you are part of the Clarke Quay actio
