Went here for a friends birthday after reading some great reviews and was not disappointed! Every dish is beautifully prepared and absolutely delicious tasting. Service was also outstanding. Fully deserves 2017 best restaurant award.
5
We chose the 2 and 3 courses lunch menu which were very nice and creative. And the portion of food is quite appropriate for ladies.
5
Went to celebrate a good friend's birthday and the whole experience was memorable. Food was great and service was impeccable.
5
Every dish was bursting with freshness and flavour, and perfectly done. Shared 6 dishes (3 course x2 people) and particularly enjoyed the raw yellowtail slices with cranberry hibiscus leaves, fresh slices of cucumber and land caviar, with dots of sour cream on nori oil. The 2 pieces of Australian black angus beef were excellently done medium rare (and no chewy bits) on a fermented mushroom puree, although the lacy thin pieces of rice crisps were a little sharp on the edges. The queensland mangoes with crème fraiche icecream, roasted nuts and some chewy nougat like cubes, were an unexpectedly refreshing end to the meal. Also tried the chicken braised in masterstock, Japanese seabream with mussels and the Australian cherries on varlhona chocolate mousse and Pedro Ximinez icecream, but didn't find them too out of the ordinary, although well done too. The warm free flow homemade sourdough bread (with french butter and Australian salt), and complimentary starter of beetroot on feta cheese were a great accompaniment to the meal. Course portions are a little small but gives one the excuse to fill up on their bread!Booked online through chope and the restaurant called me a day in advance to confirm my booking. There are 3 main seating areas - one outdoors but under shade, the other two indoors with one near the front door and kitchen counter, and the other a circular room with french windows which looks more fancy (we were seated here, perhaps as we were the first guests for lunch and had a booking)Service was impeccable and waiters attentive, I appreciated that they gave us time alone to decide on the extent of our meal investment after introducing the menu (options of 2/3/5/8 courses), and did not clear the courses away too fast

After travelling all week out of Singapore for work and missing my daughter’s birthday, we were lucky enough to get a reservation at white grass for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate together.We were greeted warmly on arrival and taken to our table inside. A bottle of champagne compliments of chef Ivan of Nouri was a great start.We chose the 5 course menu and it was delightful, full of interesting flavour and Color. A really wonderful evening, well done to the White Grass team keep up the very high standard you have created, a great addition to quality fine dining in Singapore

Brought my hubby here for his birthday celebration. The food was unique and the taste fresh and light. Tried the 8 course discovery meal and it was delicious. The only dish that didn’t quite go with me was the duck - which tasted fine but was a little too chinese tasting for me. Otherwise the food was fantastic and the service staff were very pleasant and attentive! Would definitely come again! Highly recommended

We decided to try out Whitegrass for our date night. The restaurant is located at Chjimes and was larger than expected. Interestingly it was not very full on a Saturday night. The crowd were mainly tourists which was surprising for a Singapore restaurant. The decor was more traditional. We had the five course meal and a glass of wine. We only had the choice of this and the eight course tasting menu. The meal was very good - a great mix of Western and Asian flavours with texture. All courses were great and the dishes were too big so we weren’t over full. Service was friendly. I found however the meal slightly expensive though compared to other options in town and thus why this is a four and not a five. Also the reconfirmation process could be streamlined more. I booked via Chope and whilst I didn’t need to give a credit card to confirm the booking, the reservation team tried to call me three times over the two days before the dinner to reconfirm my booking (and I could not take the calls) with a recorded message which was hard to understand, and one email. Try using an SMS service to reconfirm bookings in the future.

The restaurant is located near the entrance to CHIJMES and close to Lei Garden.Service was attentive although they could be better with topping up wine and water. Twice we had to top up wine and sparkling on our own.The five course menu started with a beautiful canapés of three followed by amuse bouche.Yellowtail sashimi was replaced by a delightful salad with cheese.The duck was excellent, thinly sliced.A chawanmushi variant was served as palate cleanser.The iberico pork was wrapped in fungus served on scallop silk, which was intriguing.The seabream was nice.The two desserts were amazing, both the Peruvian chocolate and the honey and Hokkaido milk that resembled white grass.Overall it was a pleasant dinner worth repeat visit
2
For a nice restaurant, they have what’s essentially a “communal” table in the front room. The “nice” room is really the round one inside.Anyway, when they called me to confirm the booking and I mentioned I didn’t quite like the table the last time, the staff said she would make sure I got a nice table in the “round” room. I showed up and we were put at the “communal” table. And sorry there was nothing they could do, etc etc. Food was nice, but I won’t be back
4
A table was reserved for a weekend lunch. The service was remarkably good, and the manager walked through the various set menus, and allowed ample time for deciding the set menu we wanted. The food was delicious, especially the Angus beef. We also had the Shiraz by the glass, which tastes fruity and has strong notes, and comes from Barossa Valley in Australia. For a 2 course menu, with the glass of wine, we paid close to $100 per person. It is certainly not for those without deep pockets, but it is worth the visit in celebrating anniversaries or birthdays
5
nice ambience, amazing food (though might be abit sweet), great service...
we took up wine pairing as well and it was quite nice...
price abit on the high side though...
5
Went without expectations as we’re used to being disappointed by Michelin starred restaurants, but we were blown away by the service and the standards. Food was consistently surprising and very tasty, and the setting was cozy. Very pleased with our visit. 10/10 would go again.
5
Was very pleasantly surprised by the overall experience - from the start, at Chijmes, the vibe is much more laid back and it was a nice breezy evening. The restaurant itself has good and attentive service from the moment you walk in the door and the interior lets you know that you are in for something different. Well done to the staff and chefs! The food was delicious, albeit it was quite seafood inspired, and I had been expecting more meat. No complaints, just a note.No ala carte menu, just a 5 or 8 course set menu for dinner to choose from. FYI
5
My wife and I visited Whitegrass for a birthday celebration and we had a very enjoyable experience.The ambiance was romantic and elegant, with a hint of fun, like Alice in Wonderland. We were seated in the round dinning room area; which was quieter than the main dinning hall where one could see chef Sam and his team in action in the kitchen through the windows - this seemed to be the design of modern restaurants where guests could get a feel of the cooking action.Guests would have a choice of 5 or 8 course degustation for dinner. Food was delicious with a strong Asian influence. Presentation was meticulous and beautiful to watch; this made us look forward to the next dish brings while still enjoying the current dish. Having worked with Tetsuya and Peter Gilmore, two of iconic legends in Australia culinary scenes, it's not surprising to see the standard of dishes that chef Sam Aisbett created in this restaurant and made it his own. It's truly delightful.Service was attentive and friendly; we were well looked after throughout the dining experience.We had a memorable evening
5
The menu has improved, even from some months ago. Impressive harmony of Australia style cooking and Asian ingredients such as seaweed and black bean sauce. The chef’s gift for combining and blending ingredients while allowing each ingredient to shine is notable. Each course was beautifully presented and everything was edible (and eaten!)The quality of the meats, fish, vegetables and edible flowers was high. Service was smooth and attentive and yet unobtrusive. I enjoyed my birthday dinner immensely? Thank you, Whitegrass for an unforgettable experience
5
Had a lovely lunch experience where the dishes played to our palate like fireworks to the skies... ok I am exaggerating a little, though I have to admit that the service was exemplary. Unlike other posh restaurants that we dine at, this was personable where the service staff interacted and conversed with us. Memorable experience where the dessert gave us glimpses of Peter Gilmore’s works.
5
Got a michelin star and decided to try this place at chjimesOpted for the 8 course discovery menu. Won't go into detail about each course, but they were mostly very good. Standouts include the abalone with gold leaf and cooked japanese orange dessertGood servic

This is the second visit within 30 days. Parking is easy and the location of CHIJMES in the heritage church is unusual in Singapore.The interior is tastefully appointed, elegant and comfortable. Dinning floor is well separated into two section for better privacy and could probably accommodate more than a hundred guests. Table setting is not overly pretentious, contemporary and stylist. Music and sofa are both soft and relaxing. The first dish even match their Dibbern's fine china contemporary black forest motif. A prelude to artistic and gestronomic treats. Service is attentive, professional and flawless. We had 5-course dinner with one for one for wine. When we were enjoying our coffee, I was impressed by their miniature sugar cubs, and to my present surprise, they gave us some sample, it is a small gesture that create a lasting impression. The final bill is about S$243 per head. An exceptional evening in an extraordinary resturant
5
Set in the old convent that is Chijmes, this is a superb addition to the local restaurant scene.Aussie Chef Sam Aisbett has chosen a lovely location for this Michelin starred modern Australian eatery.Not only is the food exquisitely presented, but the service is outstanding.We were a party of six and so had to chose one of the tasting menu variations in advance. Two of our party had alternative food requests, each of which was met with a no fuss change of plate.My highlight was the Japanese yellow tail with land caviar, vereduna beetroot and organic soy. That said, the grass fed beef was one of the best pieces of meat I have tasted , and works so well with the raw mushrooms, fermented black beans and veal broth.An excellent wine list is available if you don’t fancy the intelligently paired suggestions.With the amuse bouches , a five course option is more than enough, but the portion sizes mean that you won’t leave feeling over full.A must for any serious foodie visiting Singapore 
4
a closy place, tables were not too far from each other.service was attentive and not overwhelming.food was nice, great skills in cooking and very appealing presentation.yet, not too much surprises.limited choices of wine if to go by-glass.we had the 8-course menu, but in fact may try 5-course and see if it's the experience you're looking for
5
The dishes are unique and taste great. Although price is steep, the service and atmosphere was excellent. Quiet place to enjoy ur lunch.
4
I had the 5-course dinner, every course is excellent with a very good mixed of ingredients and yet it not fusion. Very tasty food, great!
5
I had a wonderful birthday celebration with my love ones. The staffs are very nice and fun. Very memorable gift from the restaurant.
5
very high quality of food, originality of the dishes, friendly staff and cosy atmosphere
cannot default that
5
Great food with wonderful creations. Excellent service makes a perfect experience. Will surely be back again.
5
Enjoyed my meal at whitegrass. Very well balanced meal with not a single dish disappointing! Enjoyable meal
5
Amazing food , refined experience all round would recommend to all to try , good to see an Australian killing it
5
It's my second time at whitegrass, and won't be ny last. It has consistently good service and stand out food. The portions are well planned so you don't feel grossly overfull like at so many other starred restaurants. Service is discreet but friendly.
5
Simply outstanding on every level. No comparison with other one Michelin star restaurants in singapore. Exquisite cuisine with service to match. Faultless design from the tableware to presentation Of food. We had the five course with matching wine. Wonderful personal touches including birthday card for our son signed with well wishes from all staff. Thank you. We look forward to our next visit
5
My 3rd visit and it still is an amazing experience from the food (we had the Discovery tasting) to the attentive service by the team.The balance of flavors was perfect but I would like to suggest that they let us have the menu at the start of the meal because the description prior to each course was complex especially after glasses of Champagne. :
5
Another great lunch served by the whitegrass team . Excellent service , food and wine selection . Loved the beetroot and the fish . Coffee is always great afterwards . Sam and Annette have really done a great restarant . Thanks again .
5
Celebrated my birthday at Whitegrass for lunch and I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Whitegrass. Will come back hopefully to try their dinner menu soon! Thank you Whitegrass!
5
Casual lunch with a friend ... he was blown away by the dessert and the petit fours (guava with black pepper ) . Overall good experience every visit :)
5
Creative and well executed cuisine. Focus on raw material and beautiful balance in taste and texture I will go again despite the price tag.
5
This restaurant is every bit the star it deserves. Excellent food. Impeccable service. Perfect Dining experience.
5
My friend and I visited Whitegrass for lunch at short notice and enjoyed perhaps the best 5 course meal I’ve had in Singapore. The ambiance was perfect - a pretty room with ample space between tables, and friendly but professional service. More importantly though each course was unique and exquisite. I can’t recommend this restaurant highly enough - for a special occasion or for someone special.
5
We each ordered a 5 course meal and turned out like almost 10 courses. Each dish was so beautifully presented and they taste awesome. on top of the set meal, there was a house-made complimentary desert as my husband's birthday surprise which tasted amazing too. every dish is an art work. we are definitely coming back
5
Our meal at Whitegrass was one of our best and we have travelled widely and eaten well. On arrival we were ushered to a delightful room with very attentive service. We had the five course degustation menu and each course was a revelation - beautifully presented and tasting superb. We were guided well with our wine choices. . After Singapore we travelled to Europe but this was the standout meal of the trip. Definitely in our top five meals of all tim
5
Probably the best food I’ve eaten this year. So many excellent flavor combinations in the Discovery degustation menu. The vegetarian menu my wife enjoyed was, dare I say it, even better than my set.The honey inspired dessert now finds itself in my top 3 best desserts I’ve ever eaten. The only fault if you wish to call it that was that you need a good 3 hours to enjoy all the courses served. Service was faultless and would love to come back
5
We like to visit Michelin restaurants in different countries, and we've visited a lot. But I was impressed by very pleasant combination of refinement and delicate sense of humor of the staff! Very light and bright. And of course very delicious food from the Chief. Great impression of this unique place.
5
Staff were very attentive and food was excellent. Was such a wonderful dining experience.
Quail was cooked exceptionally well!
5
We had 5 course menu plus a snack and free flow of delicious bread.
We finished every single dish within minutes :p They are THAT delicious. And the plating is beautiful and inviting. Very instagramable too.
It's $200+ per person and worth every cent.
5
Highly recommend. Excellent food & services. Spent around $200+ per person with wine pairing. Great ambience.
5
We haven't had such EXCELLENT FOOD AND SERVICE in a LOOOOONNNNNGGGGG TIME!! Thank You ALL at Whitegrass for making our dining experience on our wedding anniversary evening so memorable!
5
Had a great meal as always however only down side was main course scallop for white was one pc not enough to fill your tummy. 2pc would be better :)
5
Beautifully curated ingredients with the bonus of full gluten and dairy free awareness. Nice to can do attitude.
5
As Australians we are very familiar with one of our top restaurants in Sydney, Quay. The former head chef is now at Whitegrass, and it shows! The interiors are very beautiful, the staff are excellent, and the menu is flexible for number of courses. The food is perfect! Superb ingredients, beautifully executed, gorgeously plated and so much flavour. Can't be faulted. This would have to be my new favourite restaurant in Singapore. The wine list is extensive. Very enjoyable experience and truly wonderful food. I am coeliac and it was very easy to have almost everything on the menu which the chef was happy to adjust for me. That's so appreciated

made reservation a month ago for a friend's birthday, so requested for a window seat because it's a simply request. reservation was accepted, no issue. email the restaurant directly 1 week before to confirm my reservation and request. received reply from admin saying they would gladly fulfil the request. on dining date, we arrived on the dot and were ushered to a non-window seat. when asked why, answer received was simply "it's fully booked and no window seats available". i mean, really, you promised me my request and on the date itself just turned your back and say otherwise? no amount of sorry can fix our ruined dining experience, and it's right from the start even before the food is served. even though we had degustation $600+ and a birthday, we can't even get our simplest request fulfil. i've been to many 1 star restaurant, in terms of customer relations recovery, this is the worst. food is great but what's the point, when there is no personal touch and no great dining experience, it's just not michelin worthy.
5
their menu is very flexible, from 2 course to 8 coursetaste was fantastic, looked so enticing, only me and my husband ate but we brought our 6 yr. old son, he got to taste a few but because you guys allow kids, that's very ideal especially fro travelers like u
5
We had a corporate dinner at Whitegrass, in a private dining room. The F&B were perfect, the service was attentive and the venue was lovely. Altogether value for price too. Thank you, Whitegrass. p.s. I am unable to add more photos because we ate as soon as the beautiful dishes were served
4
Amazing dishes and excellent service. You must try the 3 course meal, the food looks little but end of the meal you will be satisfied. We had a business dinner with a close client and loved the food & wine.
5
Food, wine, ambience - Whitegrass had it all. A superb experience that left us happy. Beetroot with eel cigars was amazing. Enjoy it.
5
I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great dining experience. Great service, delicious food, and classy ambience. The sommelier had very good wine knowledge and the wine pairing with the 5 course menu was fantastic.
5
This was a gift three course meal paired with wine. Oh my goodness the food was delicate interesting unique and wonderful flavours and the presentation was fabulous. The staff very professional and pleasant the ambience of chimes is beautiful like stepping back in time. Yes it does cost but if you can make a special date and go you won't be disappointed.
5
My wife and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary at Whitegrass and it was definitely memorable. We love having the occasional splurge and we both agreed that only Jaan, Les Amis and perhaps Waku Ghin were as memorable in bringing quality of food, service and ambience together so successfully.We had the 5-course dinner but it ended up being 8 because of the amuse bouche, an amazing tomato 'soup' (before the first course) and a surprising chawanmushi (between first and second courses). The house-baked sourdough was amazing too, as was the sinful Iberico ham lardon that came with it! I normally don't ask for a refill of the bread but when they offered, it was hard not to say yes!It was hard to pick highlights of the meal for us but the real standouts of these standouts were the amuse bouche (in particular the deep fried Japanese crabs with a salted egg yolk crust), the tomato 'soup', the raw shaved Japanese yellowtail and the South Australian beef. The presentation of all of the dishes were wonderful and sized very well so that you didn't end up being too full by the end of the meal. The cutlery and crockery were idiosyncratic and added to the overall ambience of the place. Speaking of ambience, the decor is very warm and inviting - much like someone's dining room at home. While noise levels can get a bit high due to the hardwood floors, it never became overwhelming.Last but not least, the service which was at a very high level which is to be expected. All the waitstaff were personable, courteous, and unobtrusive. All the dishes were explained carefully and clearly too. I also had told them that this was our 10th wedding anniversary and at the end of the meal they surprised us with a card signed by all the waitstaff and kitchen crew! Oh and they also presented us with a small chocolate cake as well as some petits fours to go with our tea.All in all, a truly wonderful meal that ticked all the right boxes for me
5
If you enjoy the finer things in life, including exquisite service, delicious food in a charming sophisticated setting then look no further - you have come to the right place!My husband & I dined here just last night (Wednesday) pre booked via the internet. We knew the restaurant was fine dining but as we don't live in Singapore, had not been given any recommendations so didn't really have any expectations.Wow, were we in for a treat! The restaurant offers three menu options, 3 courses, 5 or the tasting menu which was an 8 course discovery menu. You have the option to add paired wines or go with your own selection.We decided on the 5 course menu.I could go on & on about each morsel but this review would be exceptionally long - all I will say is that each bite was a flavour explosion, truly sublime!Halfway through this gastronomic extravagance we actually forgot where we were with the courses as along with the 5 courses mentioned, there are other bites added in between.Each crafted dish is delivered to the table with a full explanation of what it contained, just so much effort for each dish.It would be difficult to say which course was my favourite but the milk & honey dessert may have topped it for me, oh and the little dish of the tomato broth served in the tiniest of teapots which included cherry tomato & cheese.The staff are both professional and attentive whilst not being over bearing - perfect.I cannot rate this restaurant highly enough, certainly one of the most memorable fine dining experiences I have ever had, and by far beats Raymond Blancs Le Manoir in the U.K. just as a comparison.When we are back in Singapore we will be visiting again - definitely a night to remember, amazing
5
We were seated in the lovely circular room with interesting plants in the centre. The design was simple, classy and yet warm with beautiful illustrations on the menu. Like the restaurant name, the food conveyed purity and beautiful simplicity. It was delectable and composed of multicultural innovation. Each dish was a unique concoction and discovery. What surprised and amazed us was that Chef served the dishes personally a number of times which he did for other tables as well. Such personable service. The service by the team was excellent, it was very professional and friendly. I had not informed the restaurant during reservation that it was a special occasion but being professional, they asked when we first arrived and surprised us at the end with a celebratory dessert and card. It was truly an enjoyable and memorable experience
5
Phenomenal food as we tried the 8-course "chef's special" menu. There were in fact 14 dishes in total (including bread and the additional side dishes). Service was excellent and despite the entire dinner taking 3 hours to complete, its definitely worth a visit once in your lifetime at least
5
We have dined at Whitegrass twice in a matter of six weeks. For us, it is the standout fine dining experience of our 3 years living in Singapore. All the boxes are ticked which is rare and probably why they won Best New Restaurant 2017 award. We had the 5 course menu both times. It is more like an 8 course menu as there are additional dishes included along the way. The appetizers are an outstanding beginning to the meal and presentation is 10/10. Chef Sam Aisbett's food is intricate and delicate without being pretentious. I would recommend referring to the online menu on the restaurant website to better understand the ingredients. One of our group had some dietary restrictions and chef was more than happy to accommodate. The space is beautifully decorated and is more like a friend's dining room than a restaurant. This is reinforced by the regular interaction with Chef during service and his lovely partner and maitre d', Annette. There is incredible attention to detail throughout the food, food presentation and decor. It is not cheap but rates very favorably compared to similar priced dining experiences in Singapore so actually felt like good value for money
5
It was for my special birthday and I enjoyed the experience throughly. The food is exceptionally different, unique yet delicious. Very well balanced dishes. It is filled with warmth and the waiters are all very attentive to your every needs. I even got a birthday card and cake.
5
Enjoyed our meal at whitegrass, Chef Sam delivers flavourful Australian dishes with a large hint of Japanese influence.
5
Food and service was excellent ! Love how the presentation of every dishes and how chef Sam serve some dishes over at your table.. very personalize! Could improve the noise level with some light music if not over all beautiful embience !
5
A wonderful dining experience, start to finish. Very clever and competent balance of east and west flavours and local ingredients. The jackfruit dessert was surprising and amazing. Reminds me of Sepia in Sydney, but what's better is that it's in my back yard.
5
Service was brilliant, the food was awesome and very well thought through. We had the 5 course lunch. Will definitely go back for more.
3
Food was a wonderful experience but unfortunately the seating area (for a table of 6) was marred by being right in front of the kitchen and the entrance which meant food service traffic and patrons had to pass by affording not much privacy at all.
5
Looking for a special lunch on the final day of vacation, so we sought out modern Aussie food with a Michelin * against its name; we we weren't disappointed. We both choose the 5 course degustation lunch with matched wine ($265pp after tax & service). Every dish we thought was delicious, with creative flavor & texture. As enjoyable a special lunch as we've had anywhere in Sing
4
My Husband and I had a nice 5-course dinner at Whitegrass. It was a pleasant evening and there is nothing to complain about. Food was good and unique, wine was also good and service was very professional.The reason it's not 5 is because the main course was a tad of a let-down. It's not that it was bad. In fact it was also good but because all the other dishes were very good, it just felt like the main was an anti climax.We'll go back again for sure but hopefully the mains will be as great as the rest of the dishes
3
My wife and I went for the 5-course meal, ordering differently so to that we get to taste all the 5-course had to offer.Even before the start and some in-betweens, they shared to us some delicacies which were very tasteful.The presentation was definitely extravagant.The starter of Raw shaved Japanese yellowtail with land Caviar and a touch of smoked organic soy was my favorite of all.The poached Fremantle octopus was too tasteful for me... too empowering, the wine (paid separately) definitely helped a lot to wash the taste in between dishes.I was not a fan of the Black Angus beef with the buah keluak puree... my tastebuds were simply having a hard time interpreting its totality.The Japanese sweetfish was a tad lovelier.The desserts were too sweet for my taste with the Peruvian chocolate winning it for me.Overall? I think it was over-priced for what my tastebuds received that night
3
Had business lunch & ordered the 3-course menu. Generally food presentation was good with small serving portion expected of a gourmet meal. Starter of beetroot salad : 5/10Mains of Iberico pork which was cooked for 8 hours as I was told : 6/10Dessert of chocolate mousse : 5/1
5
Have been wanting to try this restaurant for some time and their recent Michelin accolade cemented our choice. We had the 5 course dinner menu (SGD170++), but in reality it was more like 8-9 courses because of the complementary plates served between courses. Each course has a complex combination of ingredients and flavors which worked well and I loved every dish. I had the Japanese sweet fish for the main course and coconut mousse and jackfruit ice cream for dessert. Service was very professional but unpretentious and warm. The chef owner himself came out to introduce the first dish which we appreciated. Tables are far apart so it's great for special occasions. They also prepared a small birthday cake for us, plus a birthday card with handwritten greetings signed individually by the staff, the first I've ever seen from a restaurant. Bravo
5
We went to Whitegrass for our anniversary, it was even better than expected!
Great food, great service, for reasonable pricing for this kind of restaurant.
5
Service and food is simply terrific terrific terrific. Definitely worth your time and money. Highly recommend with no regrets. Remember to book in advance.
5
Service was excellent, the staff will explain each dish without fail and were very attentive.
Food was excellent and I will certainly be going for another meal some day.
5
Was impressed by the delication that the Chef has for each dish that he has crafted.. the eight course dinner was extraordinary with superb wine pairing!!
5
One of the most amazing three course set lunches in Singapore! We had the white cut organic chicken and the slow roasted pork jowl, both of which were beautifully presented and full of umami flavour! The chocolate mousse with sour cherry ice cream dessert was absolutely delicious. We appreciated the flavourful amuse bouche and petit fours as well. The restaurant decor is cosy and exquisite without being intimidating. Overall, service was warm and friendly, and we appreciate seeing Chef Aisbett serving a few courses himself and introducing the dishes. Loved the lunch experience and will certainly be back for dinner
5
I have been to all of the Michelin starred restaurants in singapore regularly. Whitegrass delights and surprises with its service and outstanding food quality. Easily the best kept secret in town with a degustation quality on par with the likes of Andre and easily beating traditional peers like Le Amis
5
Memorable meal!I don't like the bread because normally I like warm bread and come as a bun or piece not a sliced one. Butter is very smooth. I actually cannot remember all details in all dishes because it s a bit difficult to catch all what the service said by his accent and I'm not excellent in English too.The amuse bouche was very good. There are tomatoes inside. Not sure they smoke it or not but I really like this one. They have choices for 3 course menu. My friend and I chose different ones.First course, my dish was chicken with artichoke and sliced scallop. It was okay. I mean not bad but not so surprised about the flavor. But the first course of my friend was beetroot salad with smoked eel cream and cherries. This is excellent! My second dish was grains and seed with flavors of corn, garlic, and mushroom.The first bite, i was like wowwwwww!I love the texture and the whole flavor.Not sure the service explained me correctly or I might misunderstand. I think he told me the white thing on top is cheese but when I taste its milk. And i saw the menu again its crispy milk. My friend chose fish dish. This one tastes like you Chinese steamed fish with soya sauce. We didnt expect chinese food flavor from this meal. So i shared my friend my amazing grains and corn dish. For the dessert, lemon ice cream texture was nice and smooth. Overall I love the food here and will come back for sure!I'd like to take 5 course but my friend would like 3 course for lunch. But we must select the same. So i took 3 course. I understand but there are some restaurants that let us choose different course which is good for customers cause everyone is different, right
5
I travel sometimes for work and so find myself in places on my own a fair bit. I mix the different eating out experiences with room service when exhausted or the weather persuasive, local/street food especially in places like Singapore, and - sometimes a treat and last night was definitely a treat. More expensive than street food but - quite an experience. Each course was delicious, beautifully plated and interesting and the service was attentive but not fussy. In addition to the courses you order (3, 5 or 8) there are canapÃ©s, an amuse bouche and yummy petit fours. All in all - I would highly recommend this relatively new restaurant in Singapore whether it's a treat for just one as in my case, or with company.
4
Upon entering the dinning hall, I was greeted by friendly staffs. The dinning hall was nicely done up with nice ceiling and clean center piece. The food presentation was beautiful. The soup were especially delectable and the dessert was fabulous where it incorporate Asian fruits (eg: jack fruit, young coconuts
5
Had read so much about whitegrass we were truly looking forward to tasting the food and it didn't disappoint, from the amuse bouche through the various starters which featured comforting delicate Asian broths (and the surprising textures in the octopus); a most lush velvety buah keluak sauce (approved by nonyas!) to go with the beef; comforting porridge, perfect for the rainy day. In all, the experience took us to another place, from the location; decor; that green carpet; to the food which was comforting, teased the senses (smell taste textures sight). (The wine pairing was spot on as well) Able to cater to allergies/ food intolerances
4
The restaurant ambient is calming and nice, a good choice to catch up with friend.
Food is visually pleasing and tasteful.
5
Sensational dining experience. Culinary fusion at its best . Recommended for anyone looking for a never-before dining exhilaration.
5
We came here reading all the great reviews but not knowing exactly what to expect. We were not disappointed. Loved the interior, the food and most importantly the people. We celebrated our 3rd wedding anniversary here and it was by far the best dining experience we had, local or overseas. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend the place.

Celebrated fiancé birthday there at dinner and we both opted for the 5 course meal. We added a carafe of Pinot Noir to share as she doesn't drink much. Chef starts us with some amazing freshly baked bread with French butter and Australian Sea Salt. It came with a side of pork lard as well. Bread, butter and salt seems simple but it delighted our tastebuds with the taste and texture. We've dined at several restaurants around the world and to start off a meal like that raises expectations. We didn't quite know what to do with the pork lard I must say and left it as we both didn't quite like the taste of pork lard. We carried on with 2 more starters before the courses commence. Expectations were high given the good start. As the dishes change with the seasonal produce, I would not go through all the dishes. In any case each dish had such a plethora of flavours that it would make more sense to describe the experience than the ingredients. Chef Sam has a way of presenting his travel and working experiences onto a dish. Expectations grow with each course. It is almost like your tastebuds get to travel the world with him in one evening. Something like a sous vide tenderloin with buah keluak (a nut indigenous to Indonesia) purée makes you take a bite, pause and float way to cross the seas from Australia to Southeast Asia. You've got to try it to experience it. The pricing is reasonable compared to what the Singapore dining scene has to offer. Our carafe of Pinot Noir was excellent as well. The wine offering is well-represented and more than sufficient for a delicious dinner. The climax was pristinely well thought through. After serving our desserts, which I would describe as exotic and sensual, the server came out with another cake to celebrate the fiancé's birthday. It came with a card signed by the staff of the restaurant. Service was excellent as expected of such pedigree of dining. Would strong recommend this as one for the most excellent we've tried.

I wanted to lick every plate clean, that's how good it is. Astounded by the palate of the chef and how such Asian ingredient like Fatt Choy could surprise me! It is the epitome of fusion. Every bit in every dish goes so well together and never once out of balance. The ambience is easy, classy and very comfortable (definitely not stuffy). The moment I step out of the restaurant I am thinking of coming back again.Other than the waiting a little longer for the first course to be served...... it was thus almost perfect

I made my second visit in a year to Whitegrass, staying an extra night in Singapore to have dinner there. After my extraordinary dining experience last year I was afraid I would be disappointed but this year was even better, if that is possible. Absolutely everything about Whitegrass is perfect from the setting, the decor, the superb service to the beyond compare cuisine. Our five course dining experience was truly extraordinary. A fantastic mixture of tastes, textures with a visual presentation beyond compare. As a very well traveled culinary tourist I can confirm that Whitegrass is one of the best in the world. Do not miss this if you are in Singapore or if you're a true gourmand make a detour to try it out. You most definitely will not be disappointed

Another stunning 5 course dinner at the amazing Whitegrass! When in Singapore it is a must visit. The food is spectacular. The service stunning. The room has been decorated with amazing attention to detail. Each plate is a visual sensation and the tastes and textures of each will stun the palate. We fly through Singapore just so we can make a stop here. It is that good. The staff are very knowledgable about all the food and components. Tables are far enough apart and the noice level at a point where you can enjoy the food and the descriptions and have a conversation. Chef Sam and the team are amazing. We will be there again soon and will dream of our dinner there for a long time.

An exceptional restaurant with outstanding dishes and services! We visited Singapore to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and my Singaporean friends highly recommended this place. I reserved a table about 2 weeks advance and also emailed them about the birthday celebration. My boyfriend received a hand-written birthday card from the restaurant staffs! So surprising!We had a 5-course dishes and the food was so good! We really like the salad in the beginning which the Chef used Asian white mushroom as part of the dish. The Chef actually delivered the dishes to our table for few times and explained the idea and concept of the dishes in details. The Chef actually invited us inside of the kitchen and gave us a mini tour. Thanks for making our night so memorable!The decoration and the set up in the restaurant are very nice and I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere unique or special occasions. I am so happy that I made a right decision and celebrated my boyfriend's birthday at this exceptional restaurant

Whitegrass is the relatively new kid in town, having been open less than 2 years.They do a three or five course lunch, and a five or eight course dinner.Service is good, presentation is beautiful, and the food is really creative, blending local and Asian ingredients innovatively.We had the five course dinner which, at $175++, is reasonable given the quality of ingredients and the care taken in both preparation and presentation.Each course had its own "wow" factor, and combined to give an overall excellent meal, in comfortable and elegant surroundings.It's a fantastic venue for that special occasion
5
Have been wanting to try this restaurant but they are close on Mondays (full day) & Tuesdays (lunchtime). Am glad we finally made it there. Restaurant location was easy to locate, just at the main driveway entrance to Chijmes. The restaurant entrance had a nice inviting vibe to it. They do not try too hard. Had a 3 course set at S$64 per person. Appetizer- raw beef tartar very unique flavors. Great plating Main - lamb dish which had this great aromatic trail teasing the senses when the chef himself was serving out and explaining the mains in detail Dessert- pudding textured item, again, it didn't disappoint. It has these wonderful crunch toppings on the slim milk pudding like topped with this wonderful lemon ice cream. All in all, the flavors were amazing and great tasting for all dishes. Service by maitre'd was top notch, non too overwhelmed. We will not hesitate to return
5
servers were attentive and patient wirh our questions about their menu.
Sam was fabulous. It's rare to see the chef-owner who keeps popping out of the kitchen and serves us food himself! 👍
5
It was a special evening... and from the start the staff went out of their way to ensure it was memorable! The tasting menu was already excellent, but the chef was more than happy to accommodate a change to the main ingredient of one of our five courses, to meet our needs.The service was equal to the food... that discrete mix of being there when needed then quietly disappearing. Our evening which celebrated my wife's birthday and our anniversary, was rounded off by a specially decorated dessert, menu and card signed by all the staff!Hope to get back there in June
5
impeccable service, excellent food with many layers of texture/color/tastes. It was our anniversary, and I notified the restaurant of the event. They provided a free cake with congratulatory wordings, as well as a heartwarming gesture of a birthday card signed by the entire staff. Made us feel special and pampered. Will definitely visit again! Not sure why the word limit is not met
1
this is the place to go. upon telling the staff that a human nail was in one of our appetisers, they looked and acknowledged that yes, it was indeed human, and gracefully walked away. was not expecting anything in return, but the level of indifference was incredible. stay away
5
Beautiful attention to the food, all details thought out perfectly which showed in texture and flavour.Service was sensational, wine knowledge, and all ingredients and cooking techniques were thouroughly explained giving us a great understanding into the chefs mind, in creating our sensational dishes for our degustation.Restaurant has such a trendy modern and stylish charm, air conditioned with delicous smells of fresh baked bread and food floating around the dinning room. The whole night was perfect, couldnt be faulted. We even with a nice surprise to spoil us at the end as they found out we were on our honeymoon. Thankyou to all the staff, the lovely host, the chef and all the floor staff for making this dinner the highlight to our honeymoon.We will have to come back for our 1 year anniversary! Thoroughly recommended and a must visit before the critics praise it and award it at highest and then reservation become sort out after and hard to come by!

The mains we ordered bordered on average as the dishes sounded far more appetizing on the menu than dishes turned out to be. Scored on presentation but not on taste. Starters and desserts were good. Servers did not know who ordered what - surprising for a fine dining establishment
3
We loved the quality of the food here, some of the courses were spectacular and the wine was great but if we had some gripes:1. We were offered a cheese 'platter' outside the set menu and given were still a bit hungry we ordered; but the portion of cheese was tiny and when we complained they then wanted to charge us for extra. Put a dampener on the whole experience.2. Why not let diners eat outside? So much livelier!3. Portions are extremely delicate, incredibly tasty, but we left hungry. Not really what you expect for the money.Lastly, our complaints were taken seriously by the waiting staff but not the manager (head chef). A senior manager front of house is really needed..

The restaurant has a lovely outdoors area facing the beautiful Chjimes garden. So, we asked to be seated outdoors. The waiter apologized that if seated outdoors we could only order Ã  la carte and not the degustation menu. We said fine, sat down outdoors, and ordered two glasses of champagne. Then came the Manager, who said he was sorry, but if we wanted to be served "any" food (other than finger food), we would have to sit indoors. Outdoors was only for drinks. When we remarked that the restaurant was entirely empty (indoors and outdoors) and that the outdoors tables being 2 meters away from the indoors tables, serving us outdoors should not require much of an effort, the Manager answered that (1) they were "not going to change their 'policy' for just one customer", and (2) "this was 'their' restaurant and it was not for me to dictate how they should run it". When asked what the logic was for refusing to serve in a lovely outdoors area located 2 meters away from the indoors area while the the restaurant is empty, he replied the "the chef refuses to serve food outdoors". We left, and no-one tried to hold back the evening's only customers. Given the way they treat their customers, I am not surprised the restaurant was empty while neighboring Chjimes restaurants were bustling with activity, indoors AND OUTDOORS

Heard about Whitegrass through friends and decided to go for lunch. Had the 3 course menu with veggie salad for starters, the beef for main and the custard for dessert. I am still new to Australian cuisine but I was really surprised with the flavours, the food was excellent especially starters and main. Dessert was a bit disappointing in my opinion, they could have been smaller palate cleansers followed by the Valrohna chocolate dessert. Overall really great experience ! I am going back this Saturday to try the 5 course menu ! Can't wait !Follow my instagram account for more pictures: audeaugia

I had the 3-course lunch. My favourite item was easily the beef tenderloin, which was cooked to medium rare perfection and worked really well with the mushroom puree and beef tongue bits. This is a dish I would strongly recommend.The dessert of coconut mousse and was a little sweet for my liking, but I reckon I have less love for sugar than most people out there.The dining room is gorgeous, and from the conversation of the 2 ladies beside me, I don't think I'm alone in my opinion
5
Great food, possibly the best "real world" fine dining in Singapore, sophisticated without being overly fussy or cliched. Great fit out with attention to detail in everything. Highly recommended.
5
All the service personnel were very professional and prompt in their service. Chef took the effort to serve and explain what the dishes were about. Birthday surprise and cake when informed my partner was celebrating her birthday
5
we were here to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday. the team went the extra mile and gifted him with a card filled with signatures and greetings from the staff!
3
We ordered the 5-course set meal and experienced some pretty interesting and innovative recipes. I particularly enjoyed the sea bream and the peruvian chocolate dessert. So why the three stars? In part because there is something artificial about the place and you cannot help thinking that for this sort of money (the bill for three diners came at about US$600) you can find much better restaurants around the world. But mostly because the experience was spoiled by the white wine recommended by the sommelier - acidic, slightly off, not a match for a decent $10 bottle of Sauvignon, yet it was presented with a big song-and-dance scene and billed nearly US$150 once service and taxes were included. A shame, really. If this restaurant got a more honest sommelier and made an effort at being more genuine and sensible about prices, perhaps...
5
If you are tired of Chinese food when in Singapore try Whitegrass Restaurant a modern Australian cuisine restaurant with a great Menu selection and in my case I choose a great Steak.The accompanying wines are excellent with some great Australian red wine to choose from.Great place for dinner and convieniently located just around the corner from Raffles Hotel. Its fairly expensive but worth it
4
My colleagues and our wives ate dinner here. The food was very good. Small portions, many courses and I chose the wine pairing. Thoroughly enjoyable meal from a taste perspective. Unfortunately, as seems to be the (rather annoying) trend in Singapore these days, at 'fine dining' places, one cannot escape rather tiresome narratives by the servers about the origin of each course .. delving into intricacies such as the source of the chocolate bean that created the chocolate underlying the dessert. We were a pretty noisy group as we were having fun and that generated a few disapproving looks ;-)I'd eat there again but slimming down or eliminating the endless narratives would be a plus
3
We decided to try a new restaurant to celebrate our Valentine day this year. And it was a very disappointing event. Dishes presentation is very good but the taste is not quite there with several dishes being too salty. We ordered wine pairing for the meal and were shocked at the glass serving portion (only 2 mouthful per glass). We gave a feedback to serving staff and was told that was their practice Not to mention half the pairing doesn't hit the spot. Perhaps the Sommelier should review their wine pairing and serving portion. For this price range, one is better off dining at Saint Pierre or Spago restaurants. Better ambience, service, food and wine pairing.
5
Very personable experience. We were there for celebration and a card and cake was prepared, thank you. Food is great as expected. I think the place is worth another visit over lunch as the large windows promise change the feel of the place in the day
5
A return visit for me. Food and the experience was as amazing as the first time. Lots of effort and thought put into each course and we were constantly surprised! Apart from the lovely deco, the layout creates a fantastic ambience! Thank you Whitegrass, for yet another wonderful evening!

After hearing a lot of buzz about Whitegrass over the past year, I finally was able to get a reservation this week for dinner (I don't Iive in Singapore). And we had one of the finest and most memorable meals I've had in years. Chef Sam Aisbett personally presented and explained, at our table, many of the dishes that he created and prepared for us. Of the 11 dishes, both mains and small plates (or snacks), all were outstanding, delicious and complex in subtle ways. Perhaps the roasted pork jowl with scallop silk and white turnips, and the toriyama wagyu with mushroom purÃ©e were my favorites. Although I also found his unique take on chawanmushi just delightful. Chef Sam Aisbett, loves playing with textures - and we loved the surprising crunch of almonds with the pearl oyster or the "pop" of roe making an unexpected appearance. Service, starting with Matthew, was uniformly outstanding - informative and friendly without being intrusive - by a team who all seemed to love what they were doing, exuded passion about the food, and where they were working. Finally, the restaurant's interiors: just lovely, complementing the food in a way - reflecting a wee bit of the pervasive Japanese influence in Chef Sam's cooking, and perfectly matched to the historic building in which Whitegrass is located. This was a perfect dining experience. I highly recommend Whitegrass to those seeking innovative fine dining in an outstanding setting. Congratulations to Chef Sam Aisbett and his team

Fine food and great service. Every course was cooked to perfection. Love the ambient. Will definitely come back again.
4
It was New Year's Eve. The Chef really raised the bar. Every dish was a delight. We had a wonderful time.
4
Tasty food. Pretty presentation. Favorite dish is the braised pork and tuna tartare. Dessert (coconut mousse) was a tad too sweet.
3
Had three course set lunch. Potion was small. Was difficult to.claim the complimentary parking. Otherwise excellent service and ambience. Food was decent for that price, not exactly memorable.
5
Took the hubs there on a birthday dinner, and it was just perfect! The restaurant ambience is warm but with tables spaced very widely apart to make it feel like private dining. Service is the perfect balance of attentive, friendly and unobtrusive. And the food!! Reminds me so much of Quay in Sydney- excellent blends of textures and tastes. Every thing from the amuse bouche to the dessert was par excellence and presented like a work of art. The chef clearly loves his work and brings much of the food out himself.The 5 course meal was way more than adequate (I couldn't finish my main) and totally worth the 500 odd dollars (with wine).
5
I was sceptical about this place as it's in Chijmes but that was blown away with the quality and presentation of the food and leadership shown by chef Sam. We went for the 5 course set lunch menu which offered an array of delicious and very different, stimulating ingredients. Both myself and my guest were highly impressed with every course.Each course was introduced by Sam or another member of the well trained and on top of things team. That personal touch was always there. Fine dining with great service, not always the case in Singapore but certainly was here.I am coming back for the 8 course dinner menu. can't wait
4
Nice & cozy. Food was great! Excellent service. Michelin 4-5 stars standard. Would recommend. I had a 8 course dinner done by both Kenjiro Hashida & Sam Aisbett. I really enjoyed the dinner very much. Was really one of a kind! They brought fine dining to a different level!
4
The restaurant was known for its modern Australian cuisine, and located in Chijmes. Service was swift and smooth. I was shown to a sofa seat table with cushion around. Looking at the menu, I decided on the 3-course lunch set ($64++).The meal started with an amuse-bouche which was the chef's version of the korean bibimbap. It consisted of nori cream made with creme fraiche and nori, compressed cucmber sphere, cured trout roe, chrysanthemum petals, puffed wild rice, toasted nori, cherry bell radish, and dashi jelly. It was a party in the mouth.Roasted Mangalica pork jowl, sea scallop xo, braised wombok, land seaweedInterestingly the scallop was flattened into translucent silky sheet, which looked similar to Liang fen 涼粉, but it still retained the scallop's seafood taste. The chinese cabbage was braised in a milky creamy sauce. The pork was fork tender and flavourful.Line caught red seabream, sago porridge, fermented celeriac, young herbs, umami butterThe dish was prettily served topped with cucumber's flowers. The sago porridge sat on a pool of herb oil, topped with the fish. The sago porridge was creamy and crunchy with vegetables in it. It smelt umami when served.Australian berries, young coconut mousse, lychee granita, dried milkThe mousse was light not too sweet, which was quite balance with the slightly tart berries.The meal ended with a serving of petite four which consisted of a macaron and a tart with crispy noodle like base.I also ordered a cup of latte ($7++) to go with it.Overall the food was delicious and unique in its own way
5
I finally made it to this wonderful fine dining experience. This is truly a must try restaurant. All dishes where superb, filled with wonderful exciting flavours. We had the 5 course meal but we will definitely try the 8 course on our next visit. Many thanks to master chef Sam and his lovely wife Annette for your hospitality. We will definitely be back
4
Two lunches in several weekends apart and we've definitely become fans of this restaurant. Everything came together nicely - from the beautifully prepared food, friendly and professional service and thoughtfully designed space at Chijmes.The first time round we had the three course lunch. Impressed we came back a few weeks later for the 5 course. Chef Aisbett cleverly marries local ingredients /cooking styles to create delicious and visually pleasing dishes. This is quite hard to pulll off - many restaurants attempt to do fushion but end up too far up either the Asian or Western spectrum. If you're looking for a quiet(ish) upscale lunch in a modern space that isn't too stuffy, this is the place to head to.
5
Food was amazing with excellent friendly, warm and professional staff! Wonderful experience! So memorable!
5
Excellent fine dining experience - superb food, fantastic service and an overall great night. Sam the chef is out and about and clearly very talented!
5
Innovative modern Australian food with touches of Japanese influence that works very well on the plate. Great service and a beautiful interior. The five course menu was a perfect size, and did not leave you overly full.
4
food is excellent and client relationship is good However on a busy night parking at venue can be difficult
5
We went last thursday night. I nearly cancelled my booking because when I looked at the photos of the restaurant on the website I wasn't sure with the interior decoration. But it is so different, you can't tell from the photos. We where in the round dining room which was just right. Tables not to close to each other. Service was just perfect not to much not to little. And then the Food... Oooh goodness, Sooooo good. We have been to restaurants all around the world and some very good michelin star ones, my (French) husband said this might be the best restaurant he did in his life. With every bite we looked at each other and where thrilled by taste. We shared some excellent food. We just had one regret and that was not having chosen the 8 course menu over the 5 course menu! We will have to go back for the 8 course now.A real treat! We will be back
5
My wife and I took my visiting parents to Whitegrass after initially reading about the restaurant on a Chope e-newsletter. Further research, especially about the experience of the chef-founder, Sam, gave me sufficient reason to give the restaurant a chance.Having not been to Chijmes in over two years, I was first struct by the nighttime beauty of the location. Apparently taking the place in a former bar, WHITEGRASS, has done a great job renovating the space, for customers and the kitchen, for their beautiful restaurant.Once the food started to arrive in our five course meal (I knew my parents did not have energy or stomachs for the longer course meal), we were treated to the experienced culinary skills and creativity of chef Sam and his kitchen team and front-of-house staff. Each dish was delicious and Instagram-worthy.I would highly recommend the restaurant for couples, close foodie friends and family or deserving business clients for a nice lunch or dinner.I look forward to my next visit to WHITEGRASS
5
We went there for Saturday lunch to celebrate birthday of a family member.We have heard and read about the restaurant, so we chosen it for an important family event and honestly it was perfect, not only we get very attentive service but the food is really exquisite, so finely prepared and presented, we truly will remember it for a long while.Because we have total of seven persons, so practically we have tried every items listed on the lunch menu, from appetisers to main dishes and desserts, we cannot find any elements that we are not happy about, I particularly enjoy the vegetarian main dish, the hispi cabbage was so nicely transformed with all the ingredients and spices used, really gave me a renew thinking of having more vegetarian food going forward, the egg custard dessert is such a winner, multiple taste enjoyment in one dish.I am always puzzle that day the restaurant did not uphold its dress code of a star restaurant, I observed some guests came in with short and flip flop...
5
We managed to get in last minute and we're glad we did. Everything was beautiful that night, coming to a lovely venue, greeted like friends, treated like royalty. We didn't take long to go the whole hog with the 8-course degus with wine pairing. We detected the Singaporean touches in the chilli crab amuse bouche and the white cut chicken. A small request that better cheeses could be stocked for those who could fit in another course after a very filling and fulfilling dining experience. Save up and come here.Sydney's loss is Singapore's gain
5
Celebrated my birthday there with some friends and had an amazing experience. We went with the 5 course menu which was just divine. You really pay for what you get: amazing food and service. They overheard my friends wishing me a happy birthday and gave me a surprise cake and handsigned card by all the stuff in the end. Really made me feel special. Thank you again!!
5
Great food, great service, great flexibility in catering for a gluten free, lo-carb menu. Nothing was too difficult, as they adjusted their menu, or alternatively created new dishes. Diego's cooking was superb, with a Peruvian twist. Mandi's service was cheerful and impeccable. In fact, all the waitresses and the sommelier were super helpful and charmin
5
Good food excellent service.
Lunch set good value for money.
They had a cake, card and small gift for my wife on her birthday even.
4
The staff were courteous and the environment was very welcoming. The room where we were seated in was nice and bright and the décor / ambience was just right.
5
This place is perfection. Absolutely nothing to fault. From the reservation to the prompt call back to the patience of us being late to the friendly staff....Need I say more?
5
Sat down for lunch and was surprised to be served food I would expect from two Michelin stars. Very impressed. Staff very attentive and nice wine list. Highly recommended
4
Excellent food. Tried the 8 course dinner, too much food and didnt enjoyed the dinner. The set lunch is good and value for money too... Pretty deco that most women will like...
5
Popped in without any expectations nor a reservation and was wonderfully surprised by the service and food. Great value for money over lunch. Although the fish didn't hit the mark that day, the other courses were just delightful.
4
We have the 3 course set lunch menu, which was value for the food that we had. Appreciated the service staff who had anticipatory service towards us. May come back again.
5
Whitegrass is situated in Caldwell House, a heritage building which was formerly quarters for nuns. Australian fare with Japanese influence. Presentation was good and food was tasty. We will definitely return.
3
Plating seems to be the foremost focus together with the decor of the restaurant, both are extremely pretty. The food was okay, did not recall anything that blew my mind, some hit (Scottish beef) and miss (bibimbap). Japanese touch in nearly all dishes we tried. It could be very good but there were only two tables during lunch that makes the atmosphere very cold
5
A lovely leisurely lunch. It's rare to find service, quality of cooking, presentation and staff knowledge of this standing even in Singapore. The degustation lunch menu with matching wines was perfect from start to finish.The 5 course lunch menuLightly marinated yellowtail amberjack, green apple dashi, toasted seaweed oil, pickled hook, young herbs, frozen wasabi.NV koshinhana sakeWhite cut organic chicken, violet artichokes, pickled jellyfish, fresh and roasted hazelnuts, sesame, ginger vinegar.2015 Sauvignon Blanc, Katnook, Coonawarra, Australia.Roasted mangalica pork, scallop silk, white turnip cream, cabbage stems, fried black moss, aromatic pork broth.2015 Pinot noir, punt road, Yarra valley, Australia Grass fed beef from Scottish highlands cooked over white charcoal, 20 year aged Japanese soy, black salsify, fermented mushroom.2006 haut-medoc, chateau cantemerle, Bordeaux, France.Young coconut mousse, jackfruit ice cream, fresh longan, almond ginger cake.2013 Pegasus bay, aria, late picked, New Zealand.Manjar blanco alfajar, raspberry snowball.Certainly worth revisiting, perhaps on a monthly basis :
5
We had their 5 course meal. It was beyond expectation. Love the service crew and their delicious food. Strongly recommend it to everyone.
5
Fine cuisine in a classy atmosphere, enjoyed the set menu as I got to experience and appreciate food I would have never chosen for my self. The staff where super friendly and very hospitable. We would definitely recommend this to others
5
We sat in the inner room which provided a very nice ambiance for the meal. The food was intriguing. Wine was good and we enjoyed being served by attentative staff. Recommendable.
5
Our experience was arranged by our wonderful children for my wife and I to celebrate a number of special occassions. On entering the restaurant the Wow factor was quite evident. The staff were excellent, professional, experienced and made our dining experiencea dream. The food was a gourmets delight each meal served with expertise and true dedication. The best dining I have experienced. 10 star dining
4
Took clients here for lunch today and all round impression was great - service is attentive without being over bearing, food is delicately presented with good flavour combinations and the dÃ©cor is in keeping with the food, dainty without being wishy-washy... Didn't pay, so can't comment on price, though suspect this is a high end night expense wise - having said which, compared to other similar places (think Pollen/Jaan), the food is comparable and we were all pretty happy by the end of the meal - would make a good date place too :-

I had lunch at Whitegrass. Set lunch is available at $48++ for 2 courses or $64++ for 3 courses; or a special 5 course menu, which everyone at the table has to have, at $135++.Ambience was wonderful. Whitegrass is housed in Caldwell House of Chijmes. The decor is a little quirky, but it was still classy and understated.Service was good. Our waiter was polite, friendly and attentive throughout the meal service. Food was OKAY, like average ok, and knowing the price point, to me, it was lacklustre. Starter: Lightly marinated Hokkaido scallops, toasted seaweed oil, dashi jelly, sea succulents, frozen wasabi - The plating was beautiful, it reminded me of a secret garden of fairies full a glitter dust. But flavour wise, it did not pack a punch. The scallops were a tepid room temperate to slightly warm like it's been sitting out for a while. The other flavours complemented the dish, but was underwhelming.Main: Butter poached quail breast, toasted buckwheat, black and white garlic, shaved green cobnuts - Another wonderfully plated dish. The first bite was quite promising, the quail was well cooked at the edges and flavourful. However, as I got to the middle bit of the Quail, it was undercooked. Undercooked like it was powdery to my tastebuds. Not a nice feeling, not a nice taste. Dessert: Jackfruit granita, fresh market fruit, young coconut mousse, passionfruit jelly, coconut sorbet - I only liked the granita and the coconut sorbet, the rest of the dessert did not pair well. There was too much mousse (which only had a hint of coconut flavour, it was also bizarrely a bit warm), the bits of meringue made the dessert too sweet and killed the zing in the granita, I don't remember the jelly tasting fruity.Whitegrass places more emphasis on good looks than good substance, as seen from its lovely decor and delightful plating, but that is not enough to have me coming back
4
Stylish restaurant in the Chijmes complex with a creative menu. The beetroot salad was delicious as was the New Zealand snapper. The dessert of young coconut mousse with jackfruit ice cream, longan, almond and ginger cake was a potpourri of Asian flavours. Take it only if you love jackfruit since this was somewhat overpowering. The private room was very noisy so something needs to be done to absorb sound - perhaps carpets or fabric on the walls. Service was somewhat inattentive.
5
I recently had the 3 course dinner at this fine establishment. The food was amazing; 3 courses turned into 6 I think!The service is impeccable. The hosts were extremely attentive and knew their stuff; very knowledgable. This is a quiet and sophistcated establishment and will definitely be back again
5
This was our second visit to this lovely restaurant, having first gone just after it opened at the beginning of the year. This time we were lucky enough to meet Sam Aisbett the owner and chef who was kind enough to spend a few minutes with us at the end of service.The food is wonderful and has developed since their early days. The stand out dish of the evening was the sashimi of rock lobster with daikon flower, the balance of flavours and textures was wonderful. This was closely followed by the cherry with chocolate and coconut, a delicious pudding and a great way to end the meal. For me, there was only one course from the 8 course tasting menu (there are other shorter menus available), that wasn't quite so good, which was the grass fed Scottish beef, the flavours were a little overpowering for my taste.The design of the restaurant is beautiful, I particularly like the curved sofas in the circular room which echo the circular rug in the centre of the room - all very calm. The tables are plainer which I prefer as it gives you a chance to concentrate on the food.The maitre d' was charming and took care of us beautifully, filling in for the sommelier when he was busy with other things.A lovely evening and one we shall definitely repeat
5
We recently had luncheon at Whitegrass whilst in Singapore ....so glad we did, what a simply faultless meal...beautifully presented and afterwards I popped through to the kitchen to compliment the Chef ...he was from Australia and he and his wife have set up Whitegrass in the lovely old Chijmes area ...a delightful young man whom was producing some extra special cuisine ....I reccomend everyone to go if in that area ....well-worth it 
5
Interesting menu. Lots of talent in the kitchen, couple of dishes have similar base flavours
Great service, really attentive and knowledgable
Wine pairing was excellent and again very interactive and knowledgable

I had such a great night at Whitegrass restaurant! By far the best restaurant in Singapore. It was also great to meet with chef Sam at the end of our meal. Keep up the great work, I will definitely be back again.

Love the interior. Unlike typical fine dining restaurants, it was causal but stylish with a nice touch of whimsy. Very inviting. When the first course of yellowtail amberjack sashimi arrived, we knew we chanced upon something special. The next course of roasted young beetroot with smoked eel was perfection in a plate. Need I say more? Chef Aisbett's innovative and clever combination of flavours and texture is genius. It was a busy night, but the chef and his wife Annette were at every table. Our last minute dinner plan paid off. We are so coming back:

The most noticeable thing as you enter Whitegrass is the warm greeting fromChef Sam Aisbett & his wife Annette. Dining here is not for the faint hearted but you get well conceived, tasty food which is very nicely plated. Service was friendly and efficient. The restaurant is located amidst an ex convent & the buildings have a lot of character. There are only two menus to choose from, a 5 course and an 8 course. I opted for the 8 course as I wanted to taste a spectrum of the chef's cooking. Sam was the ex head chef at Quay in Sydney & prior to that cut his teeth as sous chef at Tetsuya's. I did not feel overwhelmed by my decision and standouts included a beetroot salad, a marron dish, butter poached quail & a moist piece of grass fed Scottish beef. There was a duo of desserts which only reinforced the chef's skill - one featuring multiple types of Valhrona chocolate & the other with feijoa ice cream on a bed of meringue crisps. Would I return? Yes but perhaps opt for the less expensive menus.

If five stars is the tops Whitegrass deserves six or more. Absolutely everything about the place is done to perfection from the ambience and service to the crockery, flowers and furniture. The most amazing perfection however is the cuisine. Every dish features surprise tastes and combinations and stunningly presented. Not fussy or pretentious just beautiful. A special tasting menu was created to meet our individual needs. I've traveled all over the world eating at top restaurants and Whitegrass rates as one of the top two I've ever experienced. I'm heading back to Singapore again just to partake of the fantastic culinary experience that Chef Sam and his team have created. Whatever you do, don't miss this Singapore gem. Who needs a Singapore Sling when you've got Whitegrass

From the moment you enter you know that this is going to be a great experience. The chef/Owner has paid so much attention to detail. From the design to the crockery for each dish to the food it is all perfection. The room has a wonderful ambience. The staff is friendly and food knowledgeable. Our dietary restrictions were taken into account and a 5 course meal had been created for us. The pace was good and the food outstanding. I would go back immediately. At the end we were presented with a copy of our meal for the evening. You must go now before you can't get a reservation.

im always skeptical when it comes to australian food in singapore. but whitegrass proves it differently. great food from the bread until the dessert which gives a wonderful experience for me and my friend. staffs are professional and very attentive too.take note on the booking cancellation fee for the reservation though. and now they are open for lunch, which it will be a good place for people to do their business meetings in my opinio

This is a grim example of a nice wrapping of an empty box. The room and tables are very nice, take a good look and spend your money elsewhere. There is a choice of two fixed menus; one expensive and one excessive. The food is not bad, but far from worth it, the staff appears a little lost and helpless. If you like to invest in a meal in Singapore, find another fine dining place. Sorry, but so it is

We tried Whitegrass, an Australian/Asian fusion restaurant at CHIJMES recently.We were welcome by Annette, their operation manager on arrival. Menu was restricted to a 5-course Set Dinner from Tuesday to Thursday, and Sunday. They also have an 8-course Set Dinner, which only available on Friday and Saturday. They closed on Monday.Since we arrived on Tuesday, we tried their 5-course Set Dinner. Here are my verdict:Starter: Marinated goat curd with pistachio bits, lemomn jam, muntries topped with chrysanthemum flowers.- interesting little dish, not part of the main course.1st course: Sashimi of yellowtail Amberjack, horseradish, toasted nori oil, salted radish, nasturtium, white soy dressing.- a fusion Japanese dish. Taste nice, I like it!2nd course: Salad of slow roasted young beetroots, smoked eel, late season cherries, rosella jam, Australian mountain pepper.- interesting dish, but just OK for me.Snack between courses: steamed egg custard with oxtail consommÃ©.- light little chawanmushi dish, nice!3rd course: Slow cooked Mangalica pork, tiger abalone, fermented cabbage, white turnip, fiddlehead fern, seaweed and pork broth.- my favourite dish of the evening. The slight fatty Mangalica pork was so soft, it almost melt in my mouth! Love it!4th course: Full blood Wagyu from Australia's limestone coast, master stock braised beef tendon and tongue, toasted organic wheat, shiitake, pickled Chinese artichoke, and burnt celeriac.- nicely medium done Wagyu steak. I like the burnt celeriac, which go well with the steak.5th course: Young Coconut mousse, Jackfruit ice cream, longan, almond and ginger cake.- I am not a dessert but love this one! The coconut mousse is nice and light, and the roasted almond added a nice crunchy touch to it! Love it!Extra Chocolate to end our meal - Raspberry Snowball and White chocolate yuzu.- I prefer the Raspberry Snowball.Service was great, attentive but not intrusive. Our main servers were Eric, and Celine, Sommelier from Leon, France (love those French accented English!). We also greeted by Mr. Sam Aisbett, Chef/Owner of the restaurant! Friendly guy! They even printed a souvenir menu for us, which include everything we have for the evening, down to our 2013 Chablis White from Burgundy France! They also shown us to their kitchen before we leave!It took us 2 hours 15 minutes to finish our dinner. We have an enjoyable evening! Love it, and definitely will return some time in the future, pending how often they change their menu (available at their official website). Also hope they will keep up with this level of service! Highly Recommended
