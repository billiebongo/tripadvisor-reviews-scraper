Weekday lunch with colleagues was very well spent. Service was a bit slow but maybe due to rush hour. Food was worth the wait.
4
Good variety of food choices in the menu. Good portion sizes also. Friendly service staff. Value for money.
4
food was of good quality and value for money but was slightly bland. could use a little more seasoning. overall, awesome experience!
4
We had their set lunch - 1 main & 2 fibers. Top up for soup, a drink & dessert. Value for money! It was crowded.
4
This is Our 2nd time dining there we like the place, food n service. We will definitely go back again.
4
Ordered a Fish & Chip and BBQ Ribs. Food is nice but BBQ ribs could be more tender. Also, restaurant charged me $2 (without informing me) for additional serving of the tartar sauce which is a small serving.
4
Was staying at Capri when we decided to try the food. Good and value for money. Should have kids meal.
4
Food taste good and not too expensive. Service could be improved since we had to grab our menus even after we were seated for around 5mins. Other than that, everything else was great.
3
Design of the restaurant is quite nice. There’s greens and textures that i personally like. They give off a very cafe feel though they are more of a restaurant i feel. Food was okay and they serve rather fast as well.

Used to love dining here as a family -- good menu, great service and of course a good price tag. Haven't been back here for quite a while and when we revisited the restaurant last evening, it's no more the same. We were quite surprised that we were able to get seats without reservation, which was a tell tale sign of the standards. In fact, their alfresco seats were mostly unoccupied, hardly the scene for a weekend dinner. We were brought in to the indoor section which now looks so different and uncharacteristic. The long communal table that runs through the heart of the indoor section has been replaced with standard tables. When we saw the menu, we could almost confirm that there might have been a change of management, maybe even a change of ownership. The menu which drew people to dine here has since been replaced with the run-of-the-mill. Nothing wrong if they could execute it well. Unfortunately not. We ordered a medium rare steak and a fish n chips. Steak was over done while the so called Thai salad was haphazardly put together. Fish was alright but I didn't appreciate that it was placed on a wooden board which is wet due to the salad oil. The truffle fries were soggy and stuffed into a bowl.That said, the service was quite alright, although not as warm as we used to experience in its previous life.In a nutshell, the only thing that's still the same is the 'Table Manners' logo hanging outside the restaurant. The rest has changed so much I don't think I would come back again unless they put a bit more heart to what they offer
1
Food took forever to arrive. Had to remind them twice. Almost finished our meal before they decided to bring our drinks. As they say, a hungry man is an angry man.
5
Our second time here. Great selection of food and drink. Recommend any chicken dish (chicken burger, quesadillas).
4
Had a fish and chips and salad. It is delicious with generous portion of fish and good batter. Salad was a good choice with unique sauce. Ambience is cozy inside but outside can be rowdy since it is a drinking place.
4
The cakes are awesome plus the tea is great.....the people do suggest to you what their specialities are and they do explain on what the details of their products are.....price is reasonable
4
This cafe is located inside changi city point, that is nearby expo mrt. When we reached the cafe, outside is crowded with people drinking at the alfresco area. The serving of the food is a bit slow though, food is slightly expensive. We had a very late dinner thus we are both very hungry, the food arrived in quite a big portion. Food is good and delicious, since they kept their door open so the aircon is not very cooling. Highly recommended to try, wanted to try the lunch menu instead though, will definitely be back to try
4
A good diner with good and affordable food. I tried the ribs and pull pork burger. The rib was good but the burger was a bit too dry for my liking. The ambience was okay for a family dinner, but not enough to differentiate from other eateries.
1
Was there with my friends for BD Celebration, food portion is small, worse still air con was shut at around 9.30pm even though it said closed at 10pm!Cannot imagine and this is the first time I have encountered with a diner place, will be my 2nd and last...Fully not recommended
3
I was here on a Saturday evening to celebrate someone's birthday. The foods selection which is mostly western, are reasonably priced and the portions were quite generous with the exceptions of the pasta. The foods were quite tasty and came with a variety of sauces. On the evening we were there, they were unable to serve coffee and milkshakes. Overall the place is nice for people to eat and catch up as the day past by
4
The food is tasty. They serve quite generous in the portion. Itâ€™s a quiet place for chit chat and gathering. The restaurant was not busy at all during our visit, however it took about 20-30 min to serve the appetiser. It paid back with the promised food taste. Overall spending $30 per pax.
4
came here for lunch with my colleagues and food was good. a little hard to get the attention of the servers as they only had 3-4 for a full indoor and outdoor seating. however, food arrived really quickly and was good. the mashed potato was the best!
5
Very busy during lunch time, but we still received attention from staff to refill our water. No pressure to finish our food quickly.
3
Had the Pasta Pescatore, which is simply pasta topped with a mixed seafood tomato sauce. Pretty tasty. The beer and wine menu look excellent too but didnt have time to try them, likely next time.
3
Good variety for proteins and sides. The lunch set is quite worth the price. Portion is good and filing. Nice place to catch up with friends and business associates.
1
Though they have lunch set menu- the service is still slow....
Ordered 1230. Food still not here 120pm already!
3
The environment is okay. Outside seats not feasible due to a lot birds sitting on the table. The waiter not helpful and being rude. Overall okay.
4
My hubby ordered the pork confit and the portion was huge. Pork skin was very crispy and the meat was juicy. I had the medium rare steak and it was perfectly done. The price is reasonable for such portion. Not a big restaurant but nice ambience and the location is convenient (within Changi City Point).

Went for lunch at Table Manners earlier this week with a few colleagues. While we weren't in a hurry, service was way too slow. Firstly it took a long while before we could grab someone's attention, and when we did, the old dude took his time like it was a leisure Sunday. And while we were told that there is a 20 mins wait for food, the actual waiting time was twice that. The food was satisfactory but if you're intending to have lunch and head back to the office on time, this ain't the place for you. Sadly, there ain't that many places in Changi Business Park for a decent Friday lunch
2
Came here with family on a weekday. It was very crowded, which looked promising.We had 2 set lunches. Truffle fries had to be sent back in as they had no truffle taste whatsoever, but came back improved. My bratwurst sausage was also cold, also returned and a new freshly cooked one was served. The spaghetti aglio olio was not al dente. The baked salmon was also overcooked and dry. The dessert was a small slice of chocolate cake that while tasted quite nice (as in not too sweet), it was stale and dry. All in all, a disappointment as I had read good reviews of this place. Hope the management will take note and strive to improve their food. The place has a lot of potential as it is well located and the setting is nice. Just improve on the food and you will have a winner here!
4
The food was good, we love their pasta and the potato wedges that came with their baked chicken dish it really was the best wedges we have ever had! However the portions do come a bit smaller so we ordered more desserts to share. Would love to have bigger main courses cos the food is really awesome!
4
The place is really packed on fridays evening. Lots of big groups from nearby offices. Place gets a bit noisy if you are sitting inside. Outdoor seating would be better if you do not mind listening in to live band music from the restaurant next door. I enjoy the starters and the wine. The laksa pasta is interesting but it is quite heavy as the coconut cream is thick. The Angus steak was a bit of a let down. We did not have dessert as it looks uninteresting on the menu. The service of the staff are excellent! Although it is crowded I have no problem getting good service from the staff.
5
With above average carbonara pasta (topped with diced bacon!!!) and baked salmon topped with a specialty sauce and lightly sauteed mushrooms, the excellent, genuine hospitality of the staff is the perfect complement to dinner tonight. Good Table Manners indeed!
5
Whether its Casual or business or alone! You will love it!
Food is good with reasonable portion and perfect pricing... service is great too!
4
Their potato wedges are still unparalleled. Miso salmon was awesome also. However the pork ribs and lemon crusted parsley fish were lacking.
4
food was very nice. but the laksa pasta was quite heavy after a while. also, it would be great if the waiters could be more alert as we tried to get their attention to order our food but most of them were inside the restaurant
5
They served only western comfort food with reasonable prices and the last order is 8.00 p.m. Best is the waiter assist to refill the water.
4
Table Manners offers a flexible set lunch menu that enables dinners to pick and choose what they feel like eating. The atmosphere is cosy and unhurried. The waiters provide good services and top up water without asking. I would recommend it for business lunch and dinning with friends
2
After waiting anxiously for the re-opening of Table Manners @ Changi Bizhub, we were gravely disappointed with the food and service. It was 45-minutes before our food were served and most of them were far from satisfactory. For example, the Fried Burramundi was over done, asparangus were "too old" and overcooked and truffle fries were soft. The Breaded Pork Cutlet was "thick" and "hard". Out of the eight sets, only the Panseared Fish Fillet was palatable. Really not worth our wait for the re-opening and the time spent waiting for our meal :
4
Service is great despite that they using a lot of part time staff.They changed their beers on the tap for cheaper/less tasteful brands.(was Stella and Hoegaarden beers before renovation and ownership changes.)We are regular customers for drinks and diner.we like the place mainly for the outdoor sitting.they do not accept Amex anymore...
2
Total time spent here, 2 hours, waited at the table, after order 20 minutes no drinks were served, food order took 5 mins to get attention. Tables were not cleared before deserts were served, asked for desert to be served, bill came instead. Overall, highly do not recommend to come unless you have a lot of patience and time to waste. Server dropped my fork for the desert, totally forgot to give me a replacement.If you expand, expand your staff and kitchen too. 没有这么大的头不要带这么大的帽子. Or in English, if u don't have such a big head don't wear such a big hat.

We were here just in March, and this month they had changed their menu.We miss their previous menu which was a more interesting offering of allowing the selection of 2 fibre and 1 protein (or even 2 protein and 2 fibre) if one feels exceptionally hungry. Their previous menu flexibility had offered myriad choices of interesting multiple combinations, whenever we dine there for lunch.Alas, their new menu is no different from any other cafe / gastro-bar in Singapore now.You can choose items from their brunch menu, or even lunch / dinner menu.We tried their fish and chips which was tasty.My mum really enjoyed their half rack ribs which were tender and of generous portion. But we did not get the mash potatoe we had requested for, and we were stuck with potato wedges which noone liked. Nevertheless, we did not ask them to change it, since we did not want to waste food.Their beef burger was with a thick beef patty, but the bacon could have been grilled longer. My nephew did not enjoy their cheese.Their half portion of roasted chicken while tasty, is on the small side, so may not be adequate for someone with a hearty appetite. Perhaps they use kampong chicken? Quarter portion of roasted chicken would have been woefully insufficient.I was recommended their butter-milk chicken burger. Bad choice as it was a soggy mess, with totally tasteless chicken patty.We wanted ice cream for dessert, but was told their ice-cream had melted. LOL.They still serve free ice water, which is great.But prices have become more expensive for standard cafe food offering, so this is no longer one of our family favourites any more
3
I must acknowledge the service staff for accommodating to my "strange" request. Thank you for putting the extra effort!
However, the food quality was not as good as before when it initially opened. Particularly the mains that we had. The side dishes was great though.
2
We thought after the renovation, they'll have new menu as well....same everything except the interiors - more seating capacity.
3
Casual dining place, average food with nothing to rave on. Interesting menu concept. Nice place to catch-up with friends over an affordable meal.
5
Food & service was great. Serving didn't come in sequence & the dinning area is too small and cramp up. Would be great if they expand :)
5
Was there for valentine's dinner - good atmosphere and very helpful staff as it was our first time there!
3
Visited this place in a group of 10pax. The place is quite compact and the service staff can be quite forgetful with respect to our orders.
4
My family frequents and enjoy our lunch at Table Manners, which is a gastro-bar located outside of Changi City Point.We find their price points of SGD15 for a Western style 'build your own platter' of two carb / vegetable (fibre) and 1 protein meal to be highly affordable, in a comfortable and cosy, sleek setting.Hence, young and old can choose their own preferred mix and match items.We usually select their striploin steak or salmon or chicken leg or southern fried chicken or hamburger steak.For the sides, their mushroom ragout and truffle fries, buttered mash potato and sphagetti are European style grub which we usually order and enjoy too.The portions are adequate and we enjoy their free flow of iced water.Their servers are friendly and efficient.They take down our orders via an iPAD.They actually prepare great drinks, and we tried a mocktail virgin mojito sorbet which was wonderful.For weekend lunch time, they are not hectic so it is a great place to enjoy a relaxing and quiet brunch.Initially, they were not easy to find as they are hidden in a discreet exterior area of the shopping mall.Highly recommended for families, couples, colleagues and even students, for their wallet friendly prices
4
We had dinner at the Table Manner Restaurant on a Sunday evening. The ambience was good, we liked the decor. The foods were fresh and the service was fast and friendly. The fish and chips was very good. We also order burger, ceasar salad and spicy chicken wings, all were great.
4
Great place for business or casual lunch. I love it that for their mains, you can mix and match various carbs, veggies and meats or Seafood to make your own customised lunch or dinner set. For those who don't know what to order, there are four recommended combos so you don't have to fret. They serve good quality coffee too! We decided to stay for coffee after eating instead of going to one of the coffee joints and it was a great decision
4
Went here for a team lunch. Food was not bad with good serving and flexibility based on the set chosen. Taste was above average overall but this is likely the best and only business setting restaurant you can get in Changi City Point.The layout was a rather weird as we were 10+ people and seated in a curved table that did not allow good conversation for the individuals.Its not bad for the place and choices around so I would recommend this for business setting meetings and/or small-medium team lunches as the setting really cannot accommodate large groups
4
Nice place nice food. Worth the price. But sadly the place is abit too small to handle so many guest.
4
Food and service was great! I had certain diet restrictions and they were more than happy to give suggestions and accommodate. Enjoyed my first time there with my fiancé.
4
The food is served promptly and the service staff are friendly. However the food heat is lukewarm only and the blasting aircon coupled with the ceiling fans only made the food cooler even quicker. Kindly revised this issue at hand else the rest are fine
5
This was an office team lunch. Booked it and walked in with no hassle. It was a great lunch gathering with colleagues at this time of the year celebrating early christmas.
5
Food was quite ok for lunch abit pricey. I prefer their dinner menu though. Coffee was ok also. Overall good dining experience
4
The food is not fantastic but we enjoy the meal. The ambience also quite relaxing on a friday night.
4
Some great choices would be Big Platter, Seafood Spaghetti, Caprese Salad! Great place in the east to check out!
4
Service is good. Food came in fast. Food quite average tho. Atmosphere is good too. Price is also good with chope discount.
5
We would like to commend your excellent staff member for his attentive and friendly service! I was at Table Manners to celebrate my best friend's birthday. Upon learning that we have a birthday girl at the table, he informed us of the free dessert we were entitled to, which also came thoughtfully with a candle. Throughout, his service was attentive but not overbearing, which really enhanced our dining experience. The food itself arrived quickly and was quite tasty, especially the truffle pasta and ebiko mussels, if a tad on the more expensive side. The outdoor dining atmosphere was perfect on that day as well, and we got to enjoy the live music from the neighbouring restaurants. It's a pity I did not get the particular staff's name during the visit, although I hope he remembers the three ladies who ordered the Spanish wine bottle upon his recommendation. The other service members were friendly too. Kudos and keep up the good service
1
We know the menu for 2years or so- as they have not changed anything! Went for lunch with my friends...since, they dont have a table- the crew literally shoped as away saying, "no table available right now". Then i asked if we can wait for while, he replied, "not sure when tables will be free".He could say, "you could wait for 15mins or so".They can try to be more accomodating...
5
Great experience at Table Manner. The food was nice and service's superb. Recommended and worth value of money
4
Good food.
I like the lunch formula where you can combine 2 meats with 2/3 sides. (Chicken parmagiano is one of my favorite dish)
Burger is decent.
Salty-caramel chocolate cake is as good as it sounds!
1
I host my group of staffs on 5th October 2016 at table manners city point. The food served were all cold and small portion. The restaurant staffs San San and Justin attitude were bad. Thumbs down. Don't bother to patronize. Waste of time and money.
3
Everything was pretty average and i kind of expected the food to taste better. Service of the wait staff was good however the manager was pretty slow in his movements.
4
I went with my colleagues during weekday lunch. Food is served quite fast with promised taste. You can choose a combinations of sides & mains for your lunch dish. The sides can choose either vege or carbs, main can be made up by meat or seafood.. just pay for what you choose... can mix & match... it is my second visit... and will be back soon.. I hope they can update the menu in near future...
3
Firstly, I must say that there is a serious lack of decent food options at Changi Business Park. The office moved here a couple of months ago and I'm stuck with making the most outta this place. Tried the set lunch at Table Manners and the "build your own" option is a pretty decent one where you choose your meat and vegetables and opt whether to top up for soup and dessert. Had the steak and it was decent but it's pre-cooked so they can only do it medium or medium well, nothing less. There were four of us dining and we all seemed to be happy with our meal. It was about 25 each for the set lunch and a non-alcoholic beve.At CBP, I probably cannot ask for more...
4
Stopped for tea and dessert and I am glad I did. The lemon and lime tart was delicious. It was rich, decadent and not too big a portion to be too sinful. Pot of tea was disappointing. It was weak and tasteless. Not many can go wrong here but they did. Perhaps two tea bags needed or less water in pot
5
The dining experience at table manners is none other than one word "awesome". The atmosphere was peaceful and calming. It is a good place for chilling and meeting up friends. The food was super tasty and fresh. My most favourite main dish is mussels with spicy cream sauce and garlic breads. And for dessert is sea salt chocolate caramel tart. A combination of bitterness, sweetness and salty taste. Wonderful
4
Dropped in for lunch. We had a combination of set A and B (fish) and the food was really good. The place was very crowded. The order placement was not that pleasant though. The waiter forgot to serve the dessert cake included in two of our orders but promptly brought the dessert when highlighted
4
the restaurant couldn't issue receipts as their system was down. the handwritten slip was back and forth many times:1. to show us how it will look like2. missed out dessert in my bill3. GST and service charge not stated, and not itemised, but was in the bill totalNot easy to get waiters attention. Had to raise my hands many times for the billFood were served on time and dessert was served quite fast after ordering. When asked for recommendations of the dessert, waiter said they never tried to eat the dessert before. That is a wrong answer!!!!!
3
The standard of the food has dropped since I last visited few months back (which was pretty good back then). Since it has been one of my favorite place for brunch, I would give the restaurant another chance.
3
love the option to pick and choose mains and sides, and whether to have an appetiser and/or dessert. Food is good on average and somewhere to eat with guests when you don't know where else to bring them
4
Have been to Table Manners couple of time
The food and service was good so far.
Staffs are helpful and they listen.
4
Had a nice quick meal at Table Manners today. Service was good. Food was tasty and at a good price. Would visit again.
4
Pick 1 meat / 2 veg for $15 (ish). That's a pretty straight-forward menu. It makes deciding what to eat very simple vs 100 items on a menu.
4
What differentiates TM from its neighbours is the good quality set lunch that you can mix and match. They have a menu of veg/carbs and meats that you get to mix and match at a reasonable price. The food was surprisingly good and the service was fast and efficient. No wonder it packs in the lunch-time crowd while the other 2 neighboring restaurants are relatively empty
5
Ordered baked salmon and for the first time in my life, I was asked how I want the salmon to be done. I asked for medium and it was cooked to perfection. We also shared the beer battered fish and chips and they were crispy and the fish was soft. The combo platter of ribs and chicken was also superb. Meat was falling off the rib bones but I thought the chicken was a little overdone.My daughter also loved the mushroom soup and she would know. She's a mushroom soup connoisseur at 13 years of age. Kids are the most severe critics.Only complaint is that they were truly generous with carbo. For the three mains, we had chips, mashed potatoes and wedges. Couldn't finish half of it
5
Didn't expect food portions to be large. Ordered half rack pork ribs and chicken cutlet with cheese and tomato (forgot their dish name, chicken parigame or something)The chicken was great, juicy in the inside. The sauce for the pork ribs was probably not to our liking, maybe difference in sauce preference. Music was a tad loud, could not engage in a private conversation properly without shouting across the table, oh boy where are my table manners?Otherwise it is a cosy environment suitable for large groups! Indoor and outdoor seatings available.Arrived 9pm on an 8:30 booking on a weekday. Not much crowd
5
Had a meal out one evening on my own. The staff were very courteous and managed to find me a good table outside. They didn't discriminate as there was only me.The food was tasty and well cooked. Exactly what i needed after a hard day at work.The beer (Hoegaarden) had been well kept and tasted good
4
Situated at the rear of Changi City Point, set next to a simple internal garden courtyard, Table Manners has both indoor and outdoor seating. As it was lunch, we opted for the indoor (air conditioned) seating but this area filled up pretty fast. The menu has the novel option of building your meal by choosing a mixture of vegetables or meat (pricing depends on which combination you choose). We chose truffle chips (nice crispy fries, don't really notice truffles!), mushroom ragout (meaty, rich), broccoli, bacon asparagus (really nice!), vegetable combination (broccoli and carrots, can't go wrong). Nothing really outstanding, but for lunch, I think it hit the right note. Service was prompt and generally cheerful, and turnover was fast
5
Always one of my favorite place to have lunch.
I can pick choose the combinations I like.
Portions are good and more than enough for lunch.
So far only lunch is my fav.
3
Great atmosphere and service. Food versus price is decent for main course. Price for starters and desert are a tad high.
5
Friendly service...I always enjoy the steak ....outdoor sitting... Nice Belgian beers...Staff recognize returning customers
4
Lively place in the evening, good food and service, fresh Belgian beer from the tab, get together with different people at long tables, very social, watch the world go by

Table Manners05/02/2016Was here yesterday while doing a visa run... The staff were great and the service was good... the only problem we had was that we arrived at 11am, but they could not serve us food, but the menu looked nice and they seemed to have a lot of specials.The beer on tap was Stella and Hoegaarden... we chose the Stalla, and it was so expensive at SGD$14 / pint. However when we paid the bill it was cheaper, so it must have been "happy hour"...Beverages : The beer was expensive…Wi-Fi : not sure...Scoring (1 to 10 for the following criteria):- Welcoming 8- Atmosphere 5- Cleanliness 8- Staff Presentation 8- Service 8- Price 1Overall Average: 6.
4
Had lunch here and was pleasantly surprised. The seating area outside is pleasant and gives a sense of bustle but not in an awkward and noisy way. The menu had various options that one could pick and mix. The person serving our table was only too happy to accommodate food allergies. The food that arrived was nicely presented and tasted fresh. Overall, a very nice place where one can sit and enjoy a relaxing lunch and coffee
4
Is that a correct title for a review? In this case, yes. Table Manners serves Stella Artois and Hoegaarden on tap. And it is fresh and crisp,in Singapore. It is like being in Belgium only on the other side of the world.We also had the salmon and steak which were quality produce, and cooked to perfection.The staff is pleasant, friendly and attentive.If you look for a nice little place for a bite to eat and a quality drink maybe consider Table Manners
4
I had dinner here with my husband a couple of weeks back. We were searching for a nice place to eat in East coast and stumbled upon very good reviews for this one. Tried out their bestsellers- truffle capellini, Kings burger, and sea salt chocolate tart. Capellini was good but a bit heavy (truffle is heavy so nothing to do with them), my husband found the burger to be ok while we liked the tart. We had also ordered the caprese salad which was delicious and had generous portions of burrata. The dessert had the perfect mix of saltiness, sweetness from chocolate and acidity from the raspberry sauce. Overall I thought it's a good option to have dinner near our house.
4
Cam here for lunch yesterday and opted for one of the set lunches. Quite an interesting concept whereby you choose which accompanying items you want in various categories. Food quality was quite good and service was remarkably efficient. Overall quite a decent option for lunch when you're in the Expo vicinity
4
Table manners is a great place at City point where there are great choices for eating.  Western food mostly.  The best thing on their menu is the truffle chicken - salty and a little sweet.  I always order the appetizer, but I think they have a main entre.  A regular stop fore when visiting signapore, but recently the food has been coming out fast but a little undercooked /rare.This place is a great place with friends or work associates.  Sit inside or out.  Music tends to spill over from other places.  Great place to people watch with a cold beer.  Happy hour prices are good too
3
The food is ok, service was very fast like you're at a fast food chain. But there was nothing special, i can also prepare the same dishes.
4
With food like lamb shank, ribeye striploin, hair angle truffle pasta and deep fried truffle chic bites as snack with beer for S$100 is a good reasonable meal.Service was good. Location was and is remote in a business park location inside a shopping mall next to Capri serviced apartment. The restaurant is tucked at a quiet alley when you turn from the Manhattan Fish market
4
We went to the TM at Changi Business Park. We were seated within 1 min, order taken within 5 mins, food arrived 5 mints later. Had chicken and ribs dishes, full pint of beer and lemon tea, set us back SGD 60. They offer a 3 course Xmas deal for $40 ++ per person. Great atmosphere with modern set up and outdoor seating. Friendly staff. Would be back

I saw this brunch deal at Table Manners on Groupon and I thought I'd give it a try. The Groupon deal was valid only for use at the Changi City Point branch, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise starting with the lovely outdoor seating area right in the garden aptly called The Oasis. The outdoor dining enclave is surrounded by real flora and fake fauna and painted across the wall is this catchy statement: “It is impolite to text at the dinner table unless you are sharing TM’s food on Facebook.” The food is also quite good. I mean we only took the brunch option, but I was pretty happy with my Eggs Benedict set which came with salad, frittes, drink and dessert. Good value for money, if you ask me. The service was commendable and we didn't have to wait long for our food. I don't know if it's only because it was quite early in the day and there weren't many people around. Nevertheless, we had a lovely time and we'll probably be back to try other dishes. Oh, and since the restaurant is located at Changi City Point, you may even do some shopping at the outlet shops inside the mall.:
5
Visited the one along North Canal Road. This place on a Friday night was particularly empty which made dinner with my boyfriend a very enjoyable and private one. The decor was nice and cosy. The food is generally very affordable for the quality and amount that was given. Must try dishes are the Truffle angel hair pasta and definitely the King's Burger. I loved their service and how polite everyone was. I am definitely coming back here again!
2
Not the first time we've dined and there's been a mistake...A group of four of us came for lunch - 2 orders were exactly the same, 2 were different, plus 2 sides. There was a bet that the order was wrong because it was never repeated back to us, so when the meals came out it was no surprise... But getting it corrected was like pulling teeth.These guys placed one of our incorrect sides under the counter (on top of side plates, in view of the restaurant) after being sent back, then brought it back to the table because we didn't want to wait for a third time to get the (1 of 2) orders sent back for correction.Definitely not "on your feet" thinkers. Didn't offer any kind of compensation for everyone eating cold food (granted the food was good - it would have been better hot or even tepid) or waiting for them to figure out what was going on.The bill was correct, so there was no excuse. When given the opportunity to make up for the delays and mistakes, the manager (Andrew) didn't even offer an apology.Pretty poor given we're in the IT district, would have regular business lunches and work across the road
2
Tried here for dinner one evening, even though there were a few tables empty it took a while to actually get one, then the 2 things we wanted were not available that evening, so we left. Didn't feel particularly wanted in the first place and no attempt was made to keep us there.Another evening stopped in for a drink, 1015pm, asked for 2 beers, was told no, they were closed. Asked what time they close, told 11pm?? Highlighted the fact was only 1015, told last orders already taken??!!Needless to say will not be going bac
4
Table manners offers a good value, customizable lunch set with various types of meat, fish and vegetables. It is also a good choice If you're looking for a place to drink a few beers in a relaxing environment. The food is good (although nothing really special) and not too pricey.

I have been to Table Manners quite a few times but only recently went there for lunch. It is perfect for a quick meal and after work drinks. The food was as expected and we had no complaints. It is very convenient for people working in the Changi Business Park are

The food is a little oily. Everything that came out had too many oil on it, and lacked flavour. I also got a passionfruit virgin mojito and it was completely tasteless.

I like the atmosphere and casual vibe. Music and decor are very relaxed. Menu is somewhat limited but a nice assortment. I had the burger and it was very good. Prices are also reasonable.

Simple dishes made very well. Great cocktails to sample on in the evening. Good place for a chill out dinner on a weeknight. Highly recommended.

Yes, it is situated in Changi, far off from the main city. However, the food and ambience here is worth all the travel. I specially like the lamb meal, very juicy and falls right off the bone. The price is also good.

TM is one of my favorite dining haunts as it serves a nice selection of simple modern fare in a casual restaurant setting that's child friendly and away from the hustle and bustle of city life.I particularly like their steak, lamb shank and spaghetti bolognese. Their truffle fries and beer battered fish and chips are worth trying too. For dessert, try their lemon tart if u have the zest, but I must warn that the tart crust is tad hard.Overall a nice dining spot in the far eastern part of the isle.

I have eaten here twice now and find this place to be a nice, quaint spot that is good for a quick meal. Both times I have been here for lunch and they have nice combo options available where you pick your main protein and side items. Both times I have been here, the food has been tasty. It's not going to win a Michelin star or anything but for what you get it is decent value. The one dish I really like at this place is their Spaghetti Pomodoro side item on their lunch menu which is absolutely delicious. The sauce has just the right amount of flavor to it with the perfect amount of cheese sprinkled on top to leave your mouth singing in harmony wanting more. It is even better than some high-end Italian restaurants I have been to! Next time I may just ask for a big dish of this instead! Also, the lemonade here is fantastic. Yes, I know it's just lemonade, but this lemonade is probably the best I've ever had in Singapore. It's very reminiscent of the old fashion type of lemonades you get around parts of the US; not too sweet, not too lemony, just the right amount of balance and tartness. The only thing that was a bit of an issue on my most recent visit was the service. While the food came quickly after we ordered, we had to ask multiple times for utensils since the box on the table was out of some cutlery. Processing the credit cards for payment was also a slow process. The atmosphere and decor of the place is also pretty cool and homey which gives it a nice cozy feel; a perfect retreat for lunch if you work in the nearby office buildings if you need to decompress a bit in the middle of the day. Despite the service issues, I will definitely be back to this place and look forward to returning

Went to celebrate my partner's birthday. Made a reservation but was late due to some issues. Table was released. But manages to get another table about 20 minutes later. A little dissapointed when the supervisor addressed me as Mr. And. I felt that she was a littke rude to the staff as well. I had actually went down in the afternoon to pass the cake to the staff and she kept it for me. Sat down and deicided on our orders. Had an Aglio Olio and a Kings burger. Orders came after a while. Aglio Olio was soso. Kings burger is great.After finishing our meals. The staff was efficient in clearing our plates. I went back to the staff for the cake and it was really sweet for her to have prepared plates for us too.. Had a great experiece overall.

Table Manners is a good-looking relatively new restaurant situated just outside the Changi City Point Mall behind the Singapore Expo. It has a nice menu full of Asian and Western classics as well as a healthily unhealthy list of delicious junk snacks. They also have a neat line in cocktails which they get from Bar Stories – the trendy cocktail place in Haji Lane (Hipster Alert). The restaurant seems to also double as a showcase for some pretentious line of furniture ware (Hipster Alert 2) and if you so choose to order a lampshade to go with your burger and fries than you have that option. The outside seating area is particularly charming and constructed just by the man-made lake with the big white balls floating in it like the balls of some mighty white god.The first time we visited Table Manners we were actually enticed in by the pleasant demeanour of an elderly waiter who must have been at least 60 or 65 years old. He was both charming and amiable; due to his sunny disposition we decided to dine at Table Manners and had a great time thanks to his quick and courteous service.The second time we visited the old man was no more… our “customer service representatives” this time were a motley bunch of hipsterish looking juveniles whose combined age looked no older than 2. There were 4 or 5 of them and they spent most of their time leaning against various tables playing with their iPhones or looking disgruntled when a customer asked them to do something. Our table wasn’t cleared; we had to collect the plates ourselves and place them elsewhere, which I suppose wasn’t so bad since I needed to stand up and get my own menus since none were forthcoming. I was already annoyed by the service at this early stage so we decided to just order some snacks and a couple of cocktails and take the bulk of our dinner money elsewhere. Lucky for us that we did so considering the first drink took 25 minutes to arrive and a further 10 minutes for the second one. If we had ordered dinner I presume it would have arrived in a time when hipsters had managed to evolve an inbuilt red-eye filter somewhere in their foreheads.Thoroughly annoyed we ordered the bill, which after the 3rd time of asking finally arrived. Being also mildly digitally inclined I opted to pay by credit card, and then wondered for the next 15 minutes what the hell had happened to my card. The wait staff had decided to sit around and play Angry Birds on their ubiquitous Apple products and nobody seemed to be manning the cashier’s desk. My patience gone, I walked up to the waitress who had served me and asked her to process the bill, but unfortunately she had misplaced my card. Instead of actually processing my bill, she had thrown the card onto one of the outside tables where anybody passing by could have taken it and walked away. When I demanded to know why she had thrown the card on the table and not processed my bill, she strangely lost the ability to speak and became intensively engrossed in the hue and shade of the concrete floor.So, if you’re spending the afternoon around the Singapore Expo and feel like some good food – check out Table Manners. If the old man is on stand-by then sit down and have a thoroughly good time. If it’s a group of surly teenagers who think they’re playing a real-life version of Cooking Mama: turn around, walk straight back into the City Point mall, and buy yourself a McDonalds instead. Your heart might not be safe but at least your bankcards will be

I like that the restaurant provides comfortable indoor seating, as well as two "choices" of outdoor seating. You can either sit directly outside the restaurant, or a little further out in the pavilion-like area, where you'll then be right next to the pond structure of the shopping mall.I sat inside anyway, as it was a warm and humid day, and liked the setting of the place. The seats are comfy and lighting perfect. The menu was something refreshing to me, not so much in terms of food but more that you get to choose a few types of food, do a mix-and-match kinda thing, and get your full brunch set. It's not fixed, like what most brunch places serve. So I picked the buttered mash potatoes, the mushroom ragout and an egg royale for my brunch set. Food was served fairly quickly, and I enjoyed my choices very much. My friend had scrambled eggs as one of her choices, and I must say the eggs tasted quite bland though.As for the serving, I guess it's sufficient for ladies. It may be a tad too little for guys, but you always have the choice of topping up about $7 to get their soup and dessert of the day, as well as a drink of your choice.In the nutshell, I'm very satisfied with this brunch outing at Table Manners, and wouldn't mind patronizing them again
