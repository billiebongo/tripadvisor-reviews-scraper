This is probably the only place in Singapore (and I stand to be corrected) where you can have a Quebec style poutine (advertised as such). It is a typical burger joint, located in the Star Vista shopping center. Both fries and burgers are excellent

When walking past it is easy to assume it is just another burger place. My co-workers had been there twice and I could not understand why they wanted to return so I went with them. I can understand why....The burgers were excellent in size and flavour. The price of the combo was very good. And the chocolate milkshakes were uncredibly unhealthily nice! I was back two or three times and the staff at the Star Vista branch were excellent. They recognized customers and their preferences which is good for a "customize your burger" restaurant.Excellent quality and a very reasonable price
