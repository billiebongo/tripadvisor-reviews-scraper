Always enjoy a bowl of porridge for breakfast. The Porridge was well cooked and the rice "melt". The portion is just nice for 3 dollars. Compatible to the Porridge I had in HongKong

Pork porridge for $3 was great. Doesn't need additional soy, it was well seasoned. There were slices of pork and little pork meatballs. It was a great breakfast for me.

If you like porridge this is the place to come. One of my favorite stalls at Tiong Bahru market but of course the venue can get a little hot. The porridge is smooth and silky and full of flavour - all for only $4/bowl.

Came by for breakfast on route to the office. Thankfully no crowd present at this hour and was promptly served a piping hot portion of their fish porridge. Texture was excellent and fish slices were good although they could have been more generous with the fish. But for the price it was reasonable. The porridge here doesn't come with the dough fritters like some other places but you can easily get them at another stall fresh from the deep fryer instead.
