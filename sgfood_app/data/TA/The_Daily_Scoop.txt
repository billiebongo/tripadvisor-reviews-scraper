A lot of uniquely Singaporean ice cream flavors for a decent price! Nice and bright decor too, which makes it a great place to meet up with friends

Had my waffles with two scoops of minty mint n berry Flavours. They were awesome . Nice place to meet up friends for tea!

This is a must go place for everyone who visits Singapore if you like ice cream. I mean, who doesn't like it?
We tried mao shan durian, lychee martinis, honey vanilla, avocadoes, and much more unique flavors

I had some time before entering a museum so I searched for a place to eat a dessert - this is how I found The Daily Scoop. Just right after opening it was not busy at all. The waiter was really helpful, he even let me taste the ice cream when I could no decide whether to match salted caramel with brownie. It was a top hit btw for me, I highly recommend for anyone who likes the mix of sweet and salty. Water was free to drink to the order. I don't know if the place has a toilette or not. It is quite a small place so I can imagine that it becomes crowded during the busiest hours. I liked the decoration and the atmosphere
5
This place is a must if you're an ice cream lover! The utterly avocado is sensational, there are seasonal icecreams as well as long term favourites at a reasonable price. Its usually busy, with a mix of students and courting couples. Bright, clean and utterly irresistabl

We went in for a refreshing after-dinner ice cream after a wonderfully big meal.The shop was popular but we still managed to get a table quickly around 8pm. The place was full of family and student groups - some celebrating birthdays with ice cream cakes. Nice atmosphere. I tried the durian flavour - a tourist moment! - and very glad they offered a tasting because it was quite intense!! I couldn't have finished a whole scoop.The lychee flavour was the winner, however, and I loved every mouthful. Really fresh flavours - much preferred than the creamier and heavier ice cream of global brands. I also preferred supporting a local Singaporean business!

head down to the Sembawang branch after strong recommendation from friend. As we went there over weekday afternoon there is no customer so we are able to try the ice cream flavour without any rush. We are spoil for so many choice available. We try quite several flavour like Golden Yuzu, Utterly Avocado, Amaretto Truffle, Maple Crisp, Sensual Tiramisu, Hei Sesame, Cha Earl Grey and etc (too many to be named). It’s depend on individual preference for ice cream as for me I prefer chocolate, light fragrant and sour type ice cream example like Cha Earl Grey, Simply Chocolate and Golden Yuzu. While my friend loves alcohol like Rum & Raisin, Bailey’s Choc Chip, Lychee Martini. It make our trip much happier with a friendly/patience staff then entertain us with all different tasting request. Waffle wise consider ok as I prefer with more crispy type rather than soft or spongy type. There is no price different like some other ice cream café do for the premium flavour. For sure I will re-visit here agai

Visited the branch by Holland Village, and it was great. Had 2 scoops, chendol (sp?) and Thai chai - heavenly. Hubby's lychee and mango were really nice too. Lady at the counter was so friendly and encouraged us to try more and more flavors. It was a little pricey for 2 scoops (S$6.6) but hit the spot on the hot day
3
been to the branch in SOTA, ice cream and waffle simply amazing. However, service was simply sucks as well. While I had not complete placing my order, the staff immediately told me how much I owe her!! Absurd!!!! Didn't even bother to ask if I need anything else nor or asked if I completed my order. Not a smile either
5
I found this to be the most cost-friendly ice cream cafe with no let up in standards. One of my favourites found here and hardly elsewhere is the chempedak flavour, gula melaka and durian are pretty awesome too. There are a host of other flavours to choose from too, and don't forget to ask for the peanut sprinkle cones which are loaded with crushed peanuts
5
This place serves the best ice cream and the waffles here, is a must! The Mao shan Wang Durian ice cream is excellent!
Weekends are very crowded and to find a place to seat may be a challenge.
4
Very busy (and noisy) ice cream shop. Unusual Ice cream flavours. We had a plain waffle and a maple waffle one with chocolate the other cookies and cream. Delicious fluffy waffles. ice cream was great but not the best. Reasonably priced. Overall highly recommended.
4
The Daily Scoop serves good quality ice cream with a smile. The prices are reasonable and it's worth a visit if you are nearby
2
I have eaten at both the Sunset Way branch and the one at SOTA, with the former being a much better dessert venue.The SOTA branch served really bland ice cream, and the service staff were clueless and rude about almost everything, from where to get the napkins when the ones on the counter has run out to where I could draw money at the nearest ATM as I have run out of cash.I will recommend the branch at Sunset Way for a more pleasant experience
4
Visited the branch at SOTA. Nice interior decor; clean and bright and is a good place for a gathering to chat or play bridge. Single scoop is $3.80. A double is $6.80. Tried the Mao Shan durian flavour (additional $1.00) & Lychee Martini. They were both really good! Would visit again.
5
Basically, it's awesome, one of the best ice cream joint in SG. Lychee Martini, Hazelnut Ice Cream, Avocado Ice Cream. I find getting a cone to be more worth it compared to getting a cup (they would try to sell you the chocolate or nut cone, you need to ask for the original) , unless your friends and you felt like sharing. Nice atmosphere for chats and bringing your family, friends, girlfriend/boyfriend etc. Very pleasant staff here, always willing to let you try their ice cream with a smile
4
I went to get a tub of avocado ice cream from this outlet. I fell in love the avocado flavor after trying it two weeks ago at Chip Bee Gardens. All five of us at dinner loved this ice cream. It was rich and creamy with just the right hint of avocado flavor. This is my favorite flavor now
3
We had just seen a Comedy Fringe event at The School Of The Arts (SOTA) and decided to pop in for dessert. It was crowded, even for a weekday night, and we had to wait for a while for a table to free up.From what we could see, their waffles are popular. We ordered one with chocolate ice cream, and an extra scoop of gula melaka ice cream.The waffles took ten minutes to prepare - while small, they were light and tasty. The ice cream scoops were of a decent size and were not overly sweet.If you cannot make up your mind immediately, you can ask for a sample of their various ice cream flavours. They currently have a durian one too
4
Passed this place while killing time waiting for a friend to donate blood nearby. It's a tiny store but the ice cream was really good, although rather expensive. I love durian and so had a scoop of that and the avocado. Both were good but the durian was very good. They had lots of other flavours and seem to rotate them depending on the day. I think you can also buy to take home but when it's 30degrees out, I think you're asking for trouble! Sit and enjoy and then go out and face the sweltering heat
4
Had 3 sets waffle/brownie with a scoop of ice cream and 2 sets of double scoops. The brownie and waffles were good, service is great but the ice cream seems to be a bit lacking. The famous alcoholic ice creams had no taste of alcohol at all thus it was disappointing
5
Nice quiet place to enjoy ice cream in the afternoons!!! Do try their durian ice cream... It's pretty heavenly...
The other flavours that are good include avocado, coconut...
5
We have enjoyed their ice-cream since when the only store was at Sunset Way. Now we visit the various outlets depending on where we happen to be.Our favourite- waffle (crispy outside, moist and tender inside) with scoop each of macadamia and coconut ice-cream. We sometimes just have this for dinner. The flavours with natural fruits are usually the best. Coconut with natural coconut flavour and little bits of real coconut- the best of any we have tried. We normally buy a big tub of rum (lots of rum!) and raisin to enjoy at home.As others have mentioned you can try the various flavours before ordering. And it does get crowded often
5
This place is always packed so be patient, you can sample various favors as you wait in line so it isn't all boring, ice cream made with local fresh fruits are the best, such as coconut, mango, Duran, etc. Outdoor seating in the evening is very pleasant

We went there on a Saturday in the month of Jan 2016. The place was completely empty save for another family of 4 occupying a table. It was a rainy afternoon which perhaps accounted for the lack of patrons. It did not help that the place is only accessible via car since it is like a 10-15 minutes walk from the main road.We ordered two waffle sets ($6.50 each), with a scoop of Hazelnut ice cream and Chocolate ice cream each. A Long Black ($2.80) and a Cafe Mocha ($3.00) topped off our list of ordered items.The waffles was undercooked and soft, not crispy as I had thought it should be.The ice cream was average at best - nothing that I would remember about.We also bought a cone of Lychee Martini ($3.50) that everyone was raving about - the conclusion? Meh, I'll take a scoop of Udder's Rum n' Raisin anytime of the day over TDS's Lychee Martini.We left dissatisfied in the downpour - it was a wasted trip. But, as I'd always say - you have to try it at least once before you leave a negative review
4
Good and tasty ice-cream. We like the cendol, durian, martini and peanut butter flavors. It is probably better to buy (pre-order is recommended) the ice-cream tubs and enjoy it at home or somewhere else as the outlets are usually crowded. Waffles served here is pretty normal so you can skip that..
4
It was my second visit to this place. As usual, their business was really good. Spoilt by the choices available, the staff allowed me to try all sorts of unique flavors! (Thank you :D) I tried their Lychee Martini (YES! Its pretty good!!) their tiramisu flavour is not too bad as well. Coconut flavour was okay too :)Definitely a place to hang out with friends, IF you don't mind the crowd and noise

I wanted my ice cream in a cone, but it was last call and they only had choco-cones. The server said so and asked "is that alright?" I said yes, but when it came time to pay she wanted 60c more for the un-asked, un-wanted choco cone. I said I didn't want to pay extra and would prefer a refund on my ice cream, but she refused to refund my money. After 30 seconds of arguing with me that I should be happy to pay 60c extra or take my ice cream in a cup, she grabbed the money out of the till and threw it at my hand violently.Awful service, RUDE, GREEDY STAFF. Never again
5
Get the simply chocolate- it's one of the best dark chocolate ice cream that you can get! You don't have to pay extra for the cone! I heard the waffles is nice, but I didn't try it this time. I tried the salty caramel and the cookies & cream- I thought it was just average! The place closes at 9pm though :
5
This ice cream cafe is located near my place and very convenient for me to pop by to satisfy my sweet cravings.Good selection of flavors and for the durian lovers, there is the Mao Shan King but for me, I simply love the vanilla, amaretto truffles and strawberry. I highly recommend the waffles which are freshly made upon ordering and very reasonably priced at S$6.20 with a single scoop of ice cream of your choice.If 1 scoop is not enough, never enough for me, just add on additional scoop at S$3.50. Ice Cream always cheers me up and makes me happy, enjoy
5
the ice cream varieties are awesome, creamy goodness that keeps you craving more. Maple crisp is my favourite, because yes.. I love maple syrup!!!!Also love the waffles, light, fluffy, crispy all at the same time... And best of all, the prices are so much more reasonable than many other ice cream parlours. Love it here
5
Best ice cream I ever tasted!!!!
The best one is durian ice cream, mint ice cream and their chocolate ice cream. Uses real ingredient and doesn't taste artificial at all!
Highly recommended!
4
DElicious ice cream with all kinds of flavours. My favourite is the good old coconut ice cream.
Try them all!
5
Witness ice cream making at the store front... Must try flavours: Lychee Martini, Avocado...
5
Love the freshly made ice cream - avocado flavour is my favourite
5
Love their Durian and Mango Ice Cream!
3
Maybe I had high expectations. It's OK.
4
Local ice-cream cafe with nice unusual ice-cream creations
5
With quite a few artisanal ice-cream shops opening in Singapore over last few years, which one to choose favorite is a matter of personal taste. For our family, Daily Scoop is a clear winner. I don't think they make bad or average ice cream. Every item on menu is above average. But my personal faves are lychee martini, durian, chendol, strawberry, brandied figs & honey and coconut. My daughter simply loves their waffles with kookie monster ice cream. Not a week goes without us visiting their Holland V Branch. The decor & service are inviting, too
4
I went to the Sunset Way outlet and it was super crowded at night. With so many people going there they should expand their outlet's size. Had Maple and Minty Mint and I liked the Mint a lot. The ice cream wasn't very thick and filling but just nice. The number of flavors are about 10, but I feel that they could have more. Service wise, the staff were pretty swamped with customers and orders so it was mostly a quick order and go
5
The flavours are unusual but very often works! I love the avocado, the coconut delight, the chendol. My durian loving friends and family swear their durian is the best! They also do ice creams for diabetics but you need to call ahead and order. I always go back for more
3
unusual favours of ice-cream.
Serving staff a bit of tao.
3
great variety of flavors!
5
Slurp! You haven't tasted ice cream if you haven't tasted Daily Scoop ice cream!
3
Interesting concoction of ice cream with liquer. Would much prefer it if they would go a little heavier on the liquer.
3
lovely coconut ice cream. the waffles are light and crisp
3
Good service, good selection
3
Without a car to drive in, it can be a little inconvenient to go to. The sitting area is very limited. Out of the 5 times I've been there, I only got to sit once. They close rather early.
4
Rich flavours, try the local spread e.g. chendol, durian... and you gotta try the chocolate chili at least once in your life ;)
5
Island Creamery's quiet competitor has a steady following amongst the residents of Sunset Way and Clementi/Upper Bukit Timah. We loyally support the makers of Peach ice cream. Not that sweetened sorbet stuff, this is proper ice cream.
4
Another great icecream place - the fig flavoured one , lychee martini and durian are very good.
4
Nice home made ice cream and snazzy decor.
5
Melissa's Ice Cream is simply great. No matter what your age is you'll love her flavors.
5
Shiok! My fav is their coconut surprise!
5
Best "homemade" ice-cream in town... not too sweet... Must try: Earl grey, Coconut, Chendol
4
Awesome home made taste ice cream!
4
awesome icecream with almost mindboggling flavours! try the honey and fig flavour! lingering sweetness of the honey is addictive, not overwhelming:D
5
lovely ice cream fabulous yummy selection!
5
Must try! Especially the lychee martini flavour
5
nice and so near my place
5
Worth trying for! Although its location is somewhat out of the norm. but the ice-creams are really nice and very singaporean.
