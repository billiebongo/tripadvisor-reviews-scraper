This little restaurant is right at a bus stop, so it is easy to get to. It is on the East side of Singapore Island, near many other restaurants. You could spend the weekend trying different foods, from Peranakan to Western to the Fusion offerings of Holqa Cafe.The restaurant is owned by a very creative young woman who, at the time of this writing, is an undergraduate business student. She is pursuing her degree in Business Administration from the State University of New York, University at Buffalo (USA), in their Singapore program at the Singapore Institute of Management. But her real love and talent is inventing new tastes. When I visited, the restaurant was giving away two free chicken wings. The wings were crispy, sweet, with a little bit of spice. I would say they were dinner and desert in one meal. I decided to skip the two free and order an entire plate of six, which was a filling lunch.Holqa Cafe also offers craft beers, so you can't do better than unique wings and a great craft beer.The menu has a variety of other options, so this isn't only about wings. They have full meal choices, and everyone should find something they like.If you happen to visit, please tell them Paul said hello.The pricing is above hawker stall prices, but below most other restaurant prices. This is a good value in Singapore, which as you know by now is the most expensive city in the world. In addition to wings, they braise their own pulled pork. Another meal great option
