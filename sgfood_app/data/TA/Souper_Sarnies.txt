Opens early at 830, serves a good breakfast during the weekdays and brunch on Saturdays.
Great place for a cup of coffee, especially on a rainy day.

A small place you could miss if you walk not looking for coffee. A short distance form the Carlton hotel and around the corner from the Orchid hotel. The variety of coffee is unparalleled. These young ladies know how to grind, brew and froth. We could not find coffee this good anywhere else in the city. The sandwiches aren't bad either. Worth the trip.

We had a quick breakfast here as it was near our hotel (the Amara). The staff were very sweet and our breakfast sets were quite nice (toast with eggs, mushroom, etc). The coffee was also quite nice. Only minor issue was the food didn't come out all together as I think they were making the items one by one as it was only a small shop with two people working. Would stop there again for breakfast, coffee or lunch
