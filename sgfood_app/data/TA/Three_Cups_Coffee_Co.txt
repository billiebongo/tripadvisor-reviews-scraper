Really enjoyed stopping for coffee and a latte at Three Cups. The manager, Wai Lee explained to us so much about the type of beans she uses and the actually process required for a consistent cup of coffee. Really enjoyable experience!

Not my first time drinking here, consistent taste. Tried the cookies of different Flavours, novelty yet smells awesome.
My favourite place to hangout for a quick coffee at One Raffles Place.

Called in with the family after have many terrible coffees during our stay. Service was fast and friendly and matched by terrific coffee. Plenty of options and varities of beans. Awesome flavour and perfect temperature. Great little shop on level 4.

Visited this place for the first time today for a coffee after lunch at a nearby restaurant. Cappuccino was served at just the right temperature with a pretty little design in the froth. Efficient service.

Liked the casual ambience of the cafe
The prices were worth the food
Would recommend for quick bites and casual lunches

Food is average but ambience is great on a Saturday especially after a workout!
Will recommend to visit on a weekend as its quiet.

Found this little cafe after my workout.
Good flat white.
Had Earthy Trio which was delicious and healthy.
Good place to chill out on weekends but not for people watchingðŸ˜Š.

Delicious and refreshing, even though they are hot! Must try when in town. Also newly renovated little shopping mall :)

The coffee and food is decent and not overly expensive, the service is great as well. I would definitely come again to this cafe.

It was time for catching with *April again, an almost yearly affair. The chosen venue was Three Cups Cafe. A very open concept it was, albeit being inside a mall's unit - one could easily see all their patrons dining or chilling out on the escalator itself, or passing by this cafe.The Valrhona Salted Caramel Tart came with a thick, rich and sticky dark chocolate ganache, blending surprisingly well with the salted caramel flavor. The crust was light and crumbly, gentle to the teeth and palate; the entire tart was well worth it.We also shared the Salmon Scrambly (SGD$11.80) under the "All Day Breakfast" section of the menu - scrambled eggs with Norwegian salmon on toasted brioche with side salad. A fairly hearty dish with crispy toast, bouncy salmon and soft, creamy eggs. It wasnt the best I have tasted, but it wasn't the worst too - average overall.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/02/lunch-at-three-cups-cafe-one-raffles.htm
