We enjoyed the duck! The skin was very crispy, but was still able to retain the juiciness. Various condiments were available for us to help ourselves
4
The duck is the highlight of the show. One of a kind, very tasty and much better than the usual "skin only" Peking duck.
3
Limited choice of food on the menu, but the duck was excellent! Price is steep and service was just average.
4
The Peking duck was good in presentation as well as taste and flavor. Other dishes we ordered were also quite good and value-for-money. Service was a bit slow as our dinner was on Sunday evening. Strongly recommended for family gatherings.
4
Nice deco, good food, excellent service and free parking. What more to ask? Only downside, aircon rather weak.
4
One of the better pekin duck served, but the restaurant did not inform us that promotion ($39 instead of $66) is not valid on weekend during my reservation through phone.

Absolutely shocked to see such an established restaurant serving shark fin soup, and not only that but having it on 4 out of 5 of their set menus. It should be utterly ashamed. To make matters worse the duck (supposedly the signature dish) tasted off. Will not be returning

We have been to the Tongluk Xi He Restaurant at Orchard many years ago. It was not a good dining experience back then. The restaurant manager kept pushing expensive dishes like abalone, lobster, crab, shark fins soup to us although we told him that we wanted Peking duck and other dishes like vegetables and normal soup. She was not happy and that was my last time to dine at Tongluk group.Few weeks ago a friend recommended TungLok Xi Heâ€™s Peking Duck at Grandstand when we dined at TungLok Private Dining.Then we thought we gave it a try again.This round the experience was good.First, the duck is delicious and value for money.Secondly, the manager is very friendly and polite. She did not push for expensive dishes.The service is prompt and good. It changed our impression about Tongluk Xi He. We will definitely go back again, but the outlet at Grandstand

the wife and i love peking duck and had been meaning to try this place. overall just ok. duck skin not as crisp as we like, meat good, service however not good at all. we felt rushed from the second we walked in. we had pre-ordered our duck (SOP at places like this) and the staff literally could not wait to serve it. doubt we will return

I brought my daddy to celebrate his birthday and booked early timing for the day. When we reached at 1830hrs, there isn't any much ppl. We ordered set meals and till the last 2nd dish served we were ask to changes table as there a a bigger grp of ppl coming in to sit the table. When we shifted they cleared our food as it was a rush... We did not even touch the food. It was crayfish Efu noodles and in the end they were embrassed and told kitchen to prepare again but without the crayfish! Upon payment the system is down and could not even register my membership card.
3
The Peking duck is nice. Other than that, the rest of the dishes are just ok. Maybe not to Singaporean's flavor.
3
Food and ambience is great. However, it's rather pricey especially if you are dining without the use of any promotional discounts.
4
The Peking duck was really good. Service is attentive and prompt. Overall a pleasant dinning experience.
3
Food is fine and quite value for money with the promo of the signature duck dish. The serving Assistants should be more attentive to customers' needs.
5
Enjoyed a family dinner at this somewhat noisy but family friendly restaurant. The duck was carved by a chef at the table and served with condiments and sauces. Food was fast and delicious. Aside from a pricey steamed fish, the rest of the food was well priced. Another family was celebrating a birthday a few tables away and rather than feeling intruded on, we felt the general festive mood all round! I would go there again.
4
The peking duck may be the only thing I’d come for. The other dishes on the menu were somewhat unremarkable. Other than that, this restaurant seems like a popular venue for birthday celebrations as we witnessed at least 2 birthday celebrations in the span of an hour.
5
Had a birthday celebration for a colleague and they even used a player for the birthday song. The staff also read out a long birthday greeting together with the birthday cake we bought.Service was fantastic and food was better than expected. Seafood was fresh. The longevity vermicielli and Peking Duck left avery good impression.It cost each of us nearly $100 for the set lunch
5
Excellent service at all required. My family juz said is my birthday today when we dine in, before we leave, the team sing birthday song to me with a free dessert and blessed me with all chinese words. What a good memory for me and my family. Thank u team. Will be back soon
5
I booked a table to celebrate my mother’s birthday on 29/11. The duck was very good and well presented. The other dish I liked was the wagyu beef. But I was not very happy with the set meal that was suggested and one of the vegetable dish tasted bitter. Overall , it was a nice experience and they added a birthday special for my mom. Just a little too expensive for the food we had!
5
Peking duck was great. We opted for salt & pepper for the rest of the duck's. It was an additional $12 but worth it as my folks enjoyed it. Tofu and monkey head mushroom was just alright. Can skip that dish in our opinion. Australian truffle beef was delicious according to my family members who enjoys beef. Service was quite attentive. We mentioned that we were feeling hot and a waitress brought a fan over for us. Haha. Overall, two thumbs up
5
The serving staffs are very polite and helpful. The environment is good for kids and my boy and nieces enjoy their food in restaurant.
5
My mum say it's the same as the authentic roasted duck she had in Beijing many years ago.
It is quite expensive but worth every penny.
In Nov 17, they have half price from Mon to Thu! Don't miss out the good deal!
5
The food was yummy and the restaurant ambience good. However, the service level can be improved. Looks a little short handed.
5
We had an enjoyable time with good food and service. Food are served warmly and promptly. Value tends to be on higher end.
4
A place to visit if you would have a craving for peking duck. The rest of the dishes were reasonable.
4
Authentic Peking Duck. They use flour base wraps instead of commercial egg wraps. Good experience. Service is a little dodgy. I had asked for the duck leg to be cut and served, but the waiter ran off with the duck and came back with duck leg bones... hmm..
2
The overall experience is not so favourable. Way below par. I have made reservations few hours before and then someone called me to confirm and that’s when I ordered the Peking duck. Yet when we arrived the duck too forever to arrive!! While another table got theirs really fast. Then I asked them to pack my duck as I wanted to leave. I told three people and yet someone served me the duck!!!! Even getting the bill was Long. I got fed up and walked out to sign for my bill. I don’t know about the rest but this place has not met my requirement for sure.
5
Can't go wrong with Tunglok. Good food, good service. First time here at this branch though. Pre bought vouchers from Chope and had 10% off. We ordered a whole peking duck, fried noodles, wagyu beef cubes, lion head meatball, mango mousse, fried redbean pancakes, fried fish, just to name a few. Leftover food was doggy bagged for dinner
4
It was a business lunch, and the service staff changed our table to a room after realising that my guests are coming shortly. Excellent service. Food was above average but I ordered the set menu (for 8 pax) and I felt that it was not value for money.The only negative point is that they cannot find my Chope reservation, and informed me that if I didn't receive any sms directly from the restaurant, my reservation is not valid. However I did receive sms & email confirmation from Chope but apparently these are not valid. Luckily the restaurant was not crowded, and they quickly rectify the situation
2
Went there for my mom's birthday and got the cash vouchers from chope. Was told that it can't be used with the set menu with complimentary moon cakes (SGD 558++) but will accept it this time as I didn't know. Was then told to get the membership, which I wasn't keen on 2 occasions over the dinner. Was then told after payment that I won't be getting the mooncakes and was charged for items which were offered as samples. Overall, the food is slightly salty and the service is average. Not worth spending 700 over in the end.
5
the best Peking duck in bad. great service and good atmosphere. can do better in price. will visit again
5
Good service and outstandingly good food. Recommended for gathering. Did a dinner of 6 pax, good food recommendation by the staff.
4
Had a pleasant lunch and it was not too busy. Peking duck was nice and was easy to talk on Sat lunch due to lack of crowds.
4
Totally enjoyed the food. The peking duck was extremely delicious, so was the other dishes e.g mian xian, triple egg spinach etc.
5
Service and food was overall satisfied. Very good.... Atmosphere was quiet, there are ample spaces around to walk around and is not that squeezy.
4
Came here specially for the duck. But the serving style is Beijing style, which means you eat the meat and the skin with the wrap, not just the crispy skin. Skin is not as crisp as expected but the price was reasonable for the portions.
3
Service is fast, and prompt.The duck came in 3 different cuts/servicing.1. Duck skin is crispy.2. Duck lean meat is 6.5/103. Duck fatty meat can be over oily for some.Overall the duck savory experience (on the duck alone) is below expectation. We have better tasting duck savory meal many really good coffee shop roasted duck selling stores.Considering the whole duck at SGD 66, and have to add another SGD 12 to stir-frying the remaining duck portion further (the dish came very salty), we seem this duck session very expensive. Overall bill came up to SGD 100+.Verdict: Will bring family for roasted duck elsewhere
3
Service staff are not very attentive and we have problems locating one. Food wise is just do able not fantastic or must try. Specially went for the Peking Duck but the staff did not tell us which will go well with what sauce. Thought it would be a plus point if staffs are more interactive and have initiative. Overall, go for one time experience only
4
I brought my family there the second time since our previously purchased Chope vouchers couldn't be used on Father's Day. It turned out to be a pretty good decision as the food tasted even better during the non-festive period. The signature Peking Duck and Sakura Chicken Soup were our favourites. We were rather disappointed with the bamboo clams and lobsters claw mee sua which turned out to be pretty bland.Overall, the experience was rather good
4
Went to Tung Lok XiHe for dinner. Had their Peking duck and a few other dishes. All the dishes came out to be very delicious and quality is good. A pity is the service can be improved. It was a Friday evening and the service was quite slow when it comes to settling the bill. We waited for almost 20 min from getting the bill to giving them the credit card. In the end, I had to go to the cashier to sign the final bill The restaurant is definitely understaffed on a Friday evening.
4
Good thing about this place is not like other area very crowed, there's alwasys plenty of parking space and restraunt also not need to wait. The pecking duck is a must try for this place.
5
food was really nice . place is quiet which is perfect for my dad.
peking duck is good as usual too.
4
The duck was good (though not great) and reasonably priced. Quickly served. Clean but simple decor inside.
5
An excellent lunch time catch up venue which provides great food alongside friendly and smiley waitresses.
3
Food and service were just average, and it was pricey which explains why the restaurant was quite empty.
2
Food nothing special, price steep. Not worth the pricing. Wrong drink given despite order are repeated.
4
While the rest of the dishes were undoubtedly decent, the star of the show was the Peking Duck and deservedly so!
5
We ordered a pecking duck and the whole family loves it. The staff are friendly too. However, the appetizer(cashew nuts) are way too expensive? I don't think they need to use such items to earn that extra revenue? And the drinks per pax is also v ex.
3
My experience with this restaurant has been bad from the beginning. At first I booked a table with them for a mother's day dinner as I had a AMEX card discount. They called to tell me that the promotion was going to terminate at the end of the month. That kind of information should seriously have been on the website. Fine, maybe I can blame AMEX for that. But on the day of the booking, they called me to confirm my booking, and despite my Indian name, the staff on the phone launched into Mandarin without so much as a pause, and I had to interrupt her and tell her to speak English.At the restaurant itself, the service was abysmal. There was no one at the front of house to deal with customers and we had to mill around and wait for a busy server to notice us. Not only that, the entrance was very off-putting, as they had thought it fit to leave around trolleys of used plates, putting off everyone.Service was abysmally slow. It took forever to serve the courses, and in total it took us 3 hours from the start to the end to get our courses. To be fair, the Peking Duck was excellent. Of course, I expected it to be, and it met my expectations. Other than that, rather boring menu
4
My husband and I brought our family here for Mother's Day and it was our first time here. The Service Manager recommended us the Mother's Day set and was even willing to allow us to exchange selected dishes for something else. The food was amazing - the Peking Duck is a must-try and was seriously the best I've tasted.Before purchasing more Chope vouchers for the meal, I checked with the Service Manager if we could use Chope Vouchers for our payment that day and she said yes. So I went ahead to purchase another $300 worth of vouchers. Little did we know that when we were paying the bills, that the cashier informed us that Chope vouchers were not applicable for special occasions. When we checked with the same Service Manager, all she could do was to apologise and asked us to come back another day to use the vouchers. Honestly, from our end, we missed out reading the t&cs during the purchase of the vouchers, but it would have been great if we were informed by the Service Manager when we checked. The dining experience could have been a 5-star one but it was unfortunate due to the inconvenience caused all because the staff was uninformed.
4
Simple dinner with family. 4+1 combination. Staff was very attentive right from the start. Ordered a number of dishes such as their signature duck, rice in superior broth, soup and a veg. The duck and rice in superior broth really blew me away. :)
5
The food was pretty good but value wise was slightly expensive. The atmosphere was awesome as there weren't too many customer at that point of time.
5
On the high end based on what was ordered. $200 after discount for 4 adults. But food was really delicious.
3
Overall satisfied and value for money especially with the American Express credit card. Will dine again. But would be good that I can bring along my kids and at the same time enjoy the 50% discount.
3
Food is ok service is ok.
Great for the ambience....
Will try others if possible.....
Not excellent.
5
The food were up to expectation and the portion of the foods were a little too much for us, we were filled to the brim but nevertheless very satisfied. ServiceTheir service was fantastic, waitresses and waiters are friendly. I went there to celebrate my birthday and the best part was (they weren't told who was the birthday girl/boy) but I guess they were observing the situation and made a smart guess that it was me. Without even being told to served the cake, they took the initiative (when we were almost done with dessert) to bring out the cake and sing the birthday song! (Which really took me by surprise and made my night) oh! And they even prepare a poem to recite for the birthday girl!
3
Prawn balls were so so and not very fresh. Skin of Peking duck was quite poor as compared to previous. Badly roasted. If it is not because of being with friends and busy with chatting, I would have ask them to replace it. Chef was not very keen in listening and understanding voice of custome
4
There's no other place that serves duck like Tunglok Xihe. The service was prompt and responsive when asked to delay serving other dishes till we had enjoyed the duck. Only disappointment was the noodles, which we had expected better. It was normal, to say the least
5
The roast duck was absolutely delicious. We were hesitant to order a whole duck in addition to our other dishes as there were only 2 of us but it was so delicious we regretted not doing that. So we will return soon and order a whole duck!
5
We went with the specific intention to order Peking duck and we were not disappointed. The duck are specially reared in Ireland for Xihe and they are served 3 ways. The fatty skin on the neck with blueberry sauce or popping sugar, breast meat and drumstick meat with the usual spring onion, cucumber and hoisin sauce. The other dishes on their menu are equally good although a little pricey. We had the marinated cherry tomato appetizer and that was really good. Pre order the duck an hour before you go so that you don't have to wait 30 minutes for them to roast it on the spo
3
The food and ambience was ok, but there is nothing compelling here to make me want to return. The staff served well, but didn't provide much explanation about the food.
There are plenty more places in Singapore to exceed this restaurant.
5
We go there quite often as a family for dinner, we love their Peking Duck. You have to book the duck in advance, and you can ask them to accommodate the rest of the duck in another dish the way you want. It can be very crowded as it is very popular with locals and thus very noisy. That is the downside of the place, perhaps quieter for lunch. We also love their razor clams with garlic, very flagrant meal
5
This is a wonderful place to go for those of us who enjoy Peking Duck -- call ahead to make sure they reserve a duck for you! It's not just the amazing experience of eating duck, but also the show of watching the chef carve the duck skin at your table. The presentation is fantastic. Not only do you get the traditional accompaniments of hoi sin sauce and spring onions, but also some unusual combinations of sauces that make this a fusion gourmet eating experience. Unlike other Peking Duck experiences, the restaurant provides ample wrappers. You also get a selection of different preparations for the duck meat. We had the salt and pepper duck, and I'm sure that all is very good
5
Went to TungLok Xihe Peking Duck restaurant at the Grandstand for my son's birthday. Booked the duck in advance and went for the set menu for the 7 of us. Duck was not disappointing and neither was the set menu. Staff were enthusiastic and helpful. Ambiance was very nice and had a luxury feel to it. Enjoyed the food and experience
4
This is our second to the restaurant for the Peking duck. The Peking duck is presented well and delicious. My 4-year-old have six rolls of the duck so we went back. However, the restaurant seems not able to deal with crowds well. We had a great experience that five people serves our 5-people table. However, this time, the restaurant is full. The presentation quality reduced that they didn't try to explain much but rush the dishes to the table. In addition, even though the services is great, few dishes and drinks are missing. In the end, we had to spend extra half an hour there. Of course, extra waiting time for kids is a bad idea..... I would suggest the restaurant to have extra services people or at least provide better training to prepare the crowds. I definitely go back but probably not any time soon

Visited XiHe Grandstand for the first time last night. Luckily I didn't read the negative reviews first or we might have missed out on a good dining experience.The good experience started with Ms Qin Qin before the visit when I was making a reservation.She pre-empted me that the restaurant will be busy and messaged me all their set menus for pre-selection to prevent a long wait. Such initiative! A first for me.And she handled my numerous questions and requests with great efficiency. And I was totally impressed that all the details was correct which she showed me on arrival. Ms Qin Qin's great attitude and recommendations added value to our dining experience despite a busy night at the restaurant.I am a vegetarian so comments about the following must try items came from my family members:- truffle soon hock, a very unique flavor not found in other restaurant. Truffle lovers should definitely order this dish. My girl liked it so much she had 2.5 servings, finishing all the last bit of the truffle sauce- specialty XiHe duck, with tender and juicy meat and crispy skin. The portion is sufficient for 8 pax with the kids having many servings. Special mention about the pancakes which was thin but yet didn't tear when the pieces were separated. And the duck came with many condiments not found with the normal Peking duck dish for each to customise to own taste. I won't spoil the surprise here.The restaurant was packed and some tables have two sittings. So true enough with some earlier reviews, the wait staff didn't show how the duck should be eaten. But there was a brochure detailing how the 3 different parts of the duck should be eaten. Our eating plates were also not changed (some restaurants changed after each course or after the fish dish) but my family is fine with such environmentally friendly practice.It took us 2 reminders to top up the chili paste but our tea pot was top up attentively, usually without our prompting.Not sure was MSG used in the dishes though as my mouth was a bit dry and my eyes took a while to open this morning. If used, hopefully the kitchen can do away with it. Those intolerant to MSG should check with restaurant first.Overall we had a good dining experience with good food, and friendly and professional service, despite a busy night with a full house
2
This was a Sunday lunch visit to the Orchard Central (181 Orchard Road) restaurant. We went specifically for the Peking duck having had some superb duck during a recent visit to Beijing in China. The duck was expensive and slightly over-rated. The staff did not even take the time to show how you make the pancakes despite a lack of customers in the restaurant.People tell me Singapore has many great places to eat - regrettably this is not one of them and I cannot recommend it
1
In a city so full of great restaurants and great service take our advice and leave this one off your list. We visited last night having pre booked through our hotel concierge with sole intention of having the Peking Duck plus of course some other dishes. We arrived into a restaurant that really is more like a fast food joint than a high class restaurant but having eaten out many times in Asia this in itself did not put us off. We ordered drinks and took the menu to decide what else we would have in addition to 'the duck'. We arrived at 9.15pm and were not told about any issues with kitchen closing any time soon, 20 minutes later we were ready to order when we were told that the kitchen was now closed for duck which came as a big shock. When we protested that that was the main reason for us coming and could they not do anything eventually after much discussion between waiter and chef we were told that they could do a duck but we would have to wait at least 50 mins. The waiter also could not explain why we had not been informed of any time limits on ordering instead just saying he was sorry. We asked to see manager who by some coincidence had just left the building! In the end we decided we were not prepared to wait until close to 11pm to eat so left. We were given our water and one beer free of charge but this was little consolation for a meal planned weeks in advance that went totally wrong
2
My sister is a Peking Duck fan & because of that we went around trying Peking Duck.To be fair, the Xihe we went to is at Orchard Central but I'm unable to find another Xihe outlet on tripadvisor.com now. So I'm writing here...Firstly, service standard is below expectation, we ordered 1 crab, 1 Peking Duck and it took a while (at least 20 minutes) for food to be served and at that moment, the restaurant is not full house yet.The Peking Duck was sliced somewhere away from us and the leftover meat and bones were not serve despite us asking.The portion is pathetic, there's 3 of us the crab with tang hoon and the Peking Duck don't fill us stomach so we ordered another noodle. There little/no staff assigned to the far away corner where we are seated so we had a hard time finding staff for our order.If you are a real foodie, Peking Duck of this standard don't meet expectation for the price we paid. Honestly, I had tried other restaurants with better standards and cheaper. Only thing there is that the presentation of the food...I will not return for Peking Duck, but maybe for the crab.

My Family gone to both XiHe location once in April and May for dinner.In April, we had dinner at the GrandStand outlet. The location was pack full of people and the service standard was low. We cannot get any attention from the service staff. When we ordered the recommendation Peking Duck, we were surprised that we were served the bones and duck remaining before we were served the duck meat and skin. We were so pissed with the service staffs respond to my question about why the bone came first before the meat. When the staff finally served us the meat, the amount of meal was so little, it not worth the money.We had another meal at the XiHe @ Orchard Central in May. This round, we feels that the service was very much better. The staffs was attentive. The quality of food was again at best average. We saw other diner ordering the Peking Duck, but I saw that qty of meat on their duck was so much more then my Duck at Grandstand. The Staff that was servicing us, by the name of Angel was attentive to our orders and needs. she could suggest and recommends what was good for the day.The meal was only spoils by the long wait between dishes. We have to wait close to 20 mins for one of the dish we order. Given that the food is just average and the Peking Duck was not the best I had. I am not keen to go back any time soo
3
Nice ambience and interesting menu. But when the food is presented, I find that less than expectation. The crab seafood broth was tasteless, the lamb ribs was far dried from deep fried.The most frustrating part is communicating with the waiter from China who was rather stubborn and refused to get help when he failed to understand us
5
Brought the whole family here for lunch and it was amazing. We ordered the Father's Day lunch set meal. The portion was large but the good was great. This is our favourite spot for their Peking duck!!!!! And a thumbs up to our lovely sever, Qin Qin, who despite its a busy Saturday afternoon still manage to display a professional attitude. Thank you
4
Caution: this review is about the Orchard central branch (181 Orchard road - level 7) NOT the Grandstand branch as we could not find it on Tripadvisor list - We were here for the Peking Duck and we were not disappointed although flavours are even better in Beijing (see our separate reviews in Beijing) - However, very highly recommended at the heart of Orchard road - Note that appetizers are billed when we did not touch it in fact, a very nasty practice as we did not ask for anythin
3
The family likes to come here when we have run out of ideas about where to eat. Its near and parking is free! The food is typical Tung Lok, a bit expensive, eat-able. The one thing I don't like about Tung Lok staff is how they only speaketh the language of the Motherland. Give me a break! Just because its a Chinese restaurant does not mean the clientele can only speak Chinese.Anyway the worse thing about this visit was the fact that its Chinese New Year season. Gone was the 'original' menu, now they only have Chinese New Year menu! So we ordered the usual, one Peking Duck cause the kids love it, so lucky these youth of today. I only ate Peking Duck the first time at a grand old age past 20! Anyway, can deny the kiddies their crispy.Today's skin was quite nice and crispy. The dim sum looked dismal though. The three measly char siew pao came in a huge steamer thingy but there were not hot to the touch. Then the siew mai came like at the end of the meal and they were not neatly arranged in its basket. The lobster noodle was not too bad. On the menu its $18 per person and we ordered for five adults but it all came in a huge plate. It was a generous portion so no complains there. We also had salted egg salmon skin which was ok but I don't understand why it has to be spicy. Not much else for the children to eat if every other dish is spicy.The maitre d' (? don't know what to call the one who takes orders) came to apologise about the slow service and offered us some free coconut juice. The juice was sweet and refreshing but we were only offered half glasses. Why bother! HahaThe shock came when we got the bill and we were charged $6 a tiny sauce plate of sliced bak kwa as appetisers. They brought us THREE some more! and they did not tell us the charges! What a rip off! So be careful the appetisers!Otherwise the food is ok if you live around the area and need a space real quick when other restaurants are full. The food is so so, not fantastic or overly delicious. The standard is uneven and there are days when the duck is super yum but other days..
1
For those who know what Peking duck tastes like, this is simply one you can taste at a local market.Not very fine. You can't expect the delectable fine crispy skin of say lmperial treasure to mention the like.Service was horrendously slow. Only one Chinese guy can understand any order. Fried mee sua came cold.Had to ask 3 times for a serving of chili Don't bother really.Disappointing for a family of 8
4
This place serves authentic Peking duck in pleasant surroundings with modern chinois decor and the ceremonial sound of the gong for great effect each time a duck is served!Apart from this signature dish, the appetizers are alright and the other meat dishes (like the pork knuckle) are slightly above average.But you go for the duck. Try all the sauces and condiments. The pancake is the best - truly authentic.Service staff are not that knowledgeable or they could really enhance the duck eating experience by orientating guests to the array of sauces and condiments
5
Really enjoy and love the food in this restaurant.. Salted Egg Salmon Skin.. Shark's fin soup with ham.. Sauteed mushroom with minced beef.. Steamed Prawn with garlic.. and their signature Pecking Duck.. Just one thing, please be aware of their operational time since they have a break time in the afternoon.
4
We have been advised in our hotel to try the best Peking duck in Singapore and this how we ended up in Tunglok Xixe. I have say that it was no regret after 30 min drive . The Peking duck was superb. Actual restaurant is quite simple but it is worth of an excellent food. We came back again with other friends few days later and again food was best
4
The Peking duck is no doubt amongst the best I've ever tasted. Juicy, brilliantly served and cooked to perfection in the open kitchen oven. The rest of the food was also good. Only drawbacks are a rather cold decoration and furniture and inexperienced waiters. Freezing cold inside, as usual in Singapore
3
What i Liked: Nice decor & free parking.What i Dis-liked: Strict policy of not allowed to consume the meat, it has to thrown away.Yes or No? No coz there is no need to eat from this specialists from Beijing, there are better ones out there..
