Very good food in a great location! Starting from the Concierge (Chesca) to the Assistant Manager (Ray) we have experienced great service! If you really want to enjoy the location, ask for a table by the window to benefit from the great view.

The dinner here is marvellous! Together with the view and friendly staff like Gabbriel, it makes our dinner experience here a enjoyable one.

Went to Stellar to celebrate my Dad's (Bronson) birthday... great service and patience from Mr. Newman and the team... witty and fun loving. Love the view and food. Thanks Stellar for the memorable experience :)

Had lunch at Stellar for a birthday celebration. Ordered the 3-course set meal. I love the salad which is the appetiser. It comes with seafood eg prawns, mussels and we could choose the other ingredients to go with it. It tastes really good especially paired with quinoa, rockets, promegranate etc. Soup is presented beautifully but it was too salty for my taste buds that they changed it the lentil soup for me. The lentil soup is slightly spicy (looks like curry) but it did not disappoint. Had fish as my main course, which is cooked well. Had a very aromatic cup of latte to end the meal with.

First time experience at Stellar at 1-Altitude. The place is cozy with not many tables. The view is fantastic especially for night time. Food once this is interesting as they serve course by course, you can also do wine pairing course by course. In between they bring you to their "little garden" where they introduce you the vegetable or spices they used. Quite interesting experience, with a high price tag.

It was my boyfriend and my first time at Stellar at 1-Altitude and we were very impressed by the service staffs. Not only did they always keep a lookout at us, if we needed something or if we needed more water etc. One service staff who really caught my attention with her amazing customer service was Ifa. Upon the serving of food, she sincerely explained to us very detailed ingredients of the dish. During our meal, she would even come to our table to ask us if the food was good. She even talked to us and it made me felt so home. The food was indeed good and i would recommend this place to everyone else

Our son took us to Stellar at 1 Altitude, Raffles Tower 1, yesterday for lunch. He had been there a couple of times earlier and insisted we must experience both the great Australian cuisine of Stellar and the spectacular views of Marina Bay.We got seated on a table next to a window offering phenomenal views of the bay as also of the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Mirror cladding has been used very effectively on the pillars next to the windows to enhance the view framed in the windows.We decided to have the Set Lunch offerings. Our son decided for a 4 course lunch and my wife and me chose the 3 course one.The Chef sent his compliments in the form of a delicious Amuse Bouche served on a soup spoon and comprising of a cut cherry tomato and small piece of mozzarella sprinkled with herbed olive oil. And the Chef delighted us with yet another — a small quantity of smooth and creamy pumpkin soup with small pieces of nuts served in small jars meant for preserves.For the First course our son had ordered a Foie gras which came accompanied with sautéed beans and hazelnuts, drizzled with a truffle dressing. The Smoked Hamachi for my wife came with very fine umbrella-shaped shavings of red and black radishes served on a sweetish relish of radish with a hint of lemon. My salad of Norwegian salmon had fennel shavings, arugula, sunflower seeds in a lime-coriander dressing. All the dishes were very well presented on the plates and were gastronomic delights, with different flavours bursting out in the mouth.The Second Course of soup arrived well spaced after we finished our First Course. Coincidentally, all three of us had ordered the LentilSoup which was served in a very interesting manner. Some sautéed spinach and small cubes of potato, topped with a tempura of a single leaf of baby spinach, came placed in the soup bowls. The smooth curried lentil soup was slowly poured into the bowls on the table. It was a small symphony performed beautifully.The Main course for my wife was a Pan Roasted Chicken and it came accompanied with stubs of roasted leeks and real baby-baby corn, all arranged on a sauce flavoured with Kafir lime. Both our son and I had ordered a Tajima Wagyu Eye Round Beef cooked by Sous-vide technique of cooking i.e. packing the beef in vacuum sealed plastic pouches and slow cooking for long in a water bath or steam. The beef came accompanied with perfectly done cubes of celeriac, kale leaves and slightly roasted tangy onions. The mains were very delightful and the beef, in particular, was so tender despite looking a little angry red. Our son’s Fourth Course of Stellar Cheeses was shared by all of us. The four cheeses, including a camembert and a blue, were nice and delightful and so were the accompanying bread, crackers, pears, muscatel raisins and the conserve.We got so preoccupied with the food that we kind of forgot to appreciate the ambience which we did over Long Black coffees, after the very hearty meal. Mirrors under the chef’s counter reflect the crockery and stemware on the tables in the restaurant very eclectically. Also, mirrors clad on the far-side wall facing the windows augment the sense of space very beautifully. By the time we finished lunch more than two hours had passed and the entire experience was very exciting. The service was excellent and discreet. The prices of the 3 & 4 course lunches were a reasonable SGD 48 & 58 respectively although some items ordered by us had supplementary charges.It sure was a wonderful experience and could have been still more rewarding had the imminent thunderstorm not prevented us from getting a 360* view from the terrace above the restaurant. Another time !!

On the plus side-service was good and view was phenomenal. But even that couldn’t make up for the disappointment of the food. Booked package 5 course dinner for 2 for xmas eve which was not cheap and really felt ripped off. The minuscule first 3 courses were a joke- tasteless. But I was still optimistic for theMain course which was a live station but even that was a let down- vegetables were undercooked and while the meat was extremely tasty- it was cold- All of it- not just one meat dish but every single one. We were so disappointed with what we had hoped would be an exceptional xmas eve dinner that we didn’t even bother waiting for our dessert course and left.I have never written a restaurant review before but was just so disappointed by this Restaurant that I decided to make the effort. Thankfully I had excellent company so my xmas eve dinner was not completely ruine

The service was great. We got premium treatment and our waitress was so nice to us and talked a lot about the food, the city, us as a couple and dogs of all things. We did the three course meal, and got 3 complimentary small dishes as well. The scallops were all raw but they assured us they were suppost to be so we dont complain. But the steak ordered medium was very dry, burnt on the outside and almost just well done troughout the stake. It was very expensive, about 430 dollars so we expected a little more of the main course. Loved that the waitress could recommend us dishes and when we ordered white peach as dessert she said it was not that good and we should try chocolate cake and mango sorbet, and im glad we did
5
This is the 3rd time we are here for dinner but don’t remember the food was so yummy. Feel that service will affect the overall dining experience. Would like to thank Theresa for the attentive & friendly service that made our dinner a very enjoyable one

It was a birthday lunch treat to one of the restaurants in Singapore that offers a beautiful view of old Harbour.The lunch was a table for 2. We had French Chicken and Snapper which was served in small portions. The Chef I presumed decorated the dish in a collection mass as I saw all was served quite identically. The waitress was pleasant but can't say much for the manager who forgot what we ordered for dessert and we had to repeat our preference again.Other than, having a nice view of the old harbour, the restaurant seems to be in need of fresh paint, carpet, and layout. It does not associate a restaurant who goes out to create a beautiful ambience for its customers- more like a canteen but serve at high price restauran
3
Arrival experience is impressive, first impression of the restaurant is wow. However the service is disappointing, very rushed service and the waiting staff does not know what they are serving, when asked they pull out a piece of paper read something to you that they clearly do not understand and do not pronounce properly. We had the 8 course set menu with wine pairing. Food was average, not bad, could have been seasoned a tilt more but nothing to write home. Wine pairing is ok however some of the recommended wines were changed because they ran out? Is it worth the $800, mmmm NO. Recommend going for the al a care menu, might have better luck there, the view is the only selling point for me
5
Ordered a three course set lunch. The food was excellent for every dish. The first course of Hamachi with Sea Urchin was surprisingly good. The main course of baked grouper with the lemon creme sauce was excellent as it paired so well with the fish. Opted for dessert instead of soup. Ordered a cucumber shorbet. It came with a nice short presentation. The taste of cucumber was not over powering as they paired it with deep freeze raspberry bits. So it has that tantalising sweet sour taste combination. The view was superb as was given a window seat. Would recommend people to give it a try if they are in Singapore as the restaurant is located at the tallest building in Singapore. Superb lunch.

Brought a friend from Australia to dine at Stellar. Views were great. Food was good until they served the fish. 4 bones in my fish with one stuck in my gum. I took a while to use the toothpick to literally ‘dig’ it out. No apology from the chef or the manager. Only thankful for the Asst. Manager who asked how I was when I came out of the toilet. For the price I paid, I would recommend paying a bit more for Odette or Jaan, where you are guaranteed of good food and good service.Disappointed entirely to have brought a foreign guest which ended off with such an experience.
3
Birthday set digustation menu dinner, unfortunately the matching wines were too cheap and not really matching to the food. The freshness of meals were as expected for the price but merengue in nitrogen something badly chosen for the set. Would recommend for view only not nice dinner.
5
Have been here a few times and never had a bad meal or evening. Warm welcome, good but not over fawning service. Get a seat at the window to enjoy the view.Depending when you go you can have a choice of menu. Typically about a 6 course menu with a great mix of dishes. Good wine list too. Bonus is if you eat here you can go upstairs to 1 Altitude after. Nice rooftop bar club with a nice mix of locals and tourists. All round a worthwhile way to spend a night.
4
The service and view were fantastic as per the first time I went. This time I went there with my husband and mother-in-law. We took the 3 course set lunch and really enjoyed the starters. I especially love the tiger prawns and salmon. The 3 of us chose different main dishes. The wagyu was quite disappointing and it was not something we would order again. The better dish was the iberico pluma. The meat was succulent and the gravy was tasty. We had strawberry sorbet and brulee for desserts. The sorbet was very interesting but we enjoyed the brulee more. All in all, a good lunch and looking forward to visiting the place for dinner
5
We had a dinner celebration at Stellar for our Wedding Anniversary and had a great experience there, be it food, the view and the services. They serve their 6/8 course dinner set which was quite nice, we get to sample quite a bit of their food. We had the 6-course with their complimentary starters and all, its just enough for us, if you are big eater you could consider the 8-course. The food is exquisite and the chef will explain how the dish was prepared and where he got his ingredients from, so that was interesting.
4
View - 10/10 (if u get the window seats)
Service - 9/10 (attentive & strikes conversation)
Ambience - 8/10
Food - 6/10 (desserts & appetizer are generally better than mains haha...)
Price - You pay for the view ;)
3
Surprisingly the fine dining experience was average. Take too much time for a six course meal where the food does not taster vibrant as the surrounding and location.
5
Yes, this restaurant is expensive. but it's worth it, cool interior and furnishings, the view on the proud from this floor is simply awesome!
4
Located on the upper floor of one of the tallest buildings in Singapore. Great quality dinner with an amazing view on the city by night. Very good service, as always in Asia.
Go to the rooftop terrace for a drink after dinner.
5
After visiting Altitude in the morning we decided to return again at night for the dinner/evening experience. The views at night are spectacular. The meal was 6 star and fantastic portions. However the service in the restaurant was what made the night special. The only negative was the bar staff up on the viewing level was not friendly and borderline rude.
5
Went as a surprise celebration for my significant other and he was absolutely stunned. So happy, and incredibly delighted. I setup the reservation for 6.30, thus we had the window table all for us. Our waitress Teresa was absolutely delightful, engaging and very attentive. From the wine selection (We ordered an Austrian white wine for our pairing) to the descriptions of each of our dishes (We ordered the 6 course constellation), she was very well versed, and gave us our space, knowing it was a very special moment for us tonight. The views were stunning, and we were able to see the transition from dusk till night rolling in across the Marina Bay area. Yes people keep saying you pay for the view, but please don't ignore the service. We even had the herb tasting called 'trip to the garden' where we sampled the fresh grown on site produce, and were given a scintillating meringue with liquid nitrogen. Much to the amusement of the wait staff and the chef, me and my partner were inhaling and exhaling profusely as this was a palette cleanser (very cool). To end the night I indicated a special request to write 'Happy Birthday' on the dessert plate we were given, and the demonstration of the creation of our selected desserts were a delight! Not to be missed. Yes, again a lot would say it's expensive, but if you're going to want fine dining, with excellent service and a killer view, quit whinging and complaining about the price, so sick of people doing this and wanting 'value for money service'. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it was well worth it. P.S. Try the Oyster blade from Tajima, buttery soft in it's entirety, and cooked to absolute perfection, so that when it hits the mouth it melts on contact. Surely not to be missed. P.P.S. If you love vegemite the introduction is not to be missed! Nostalgic take on the home made spread. Brings back fond memories

We had a magical last night in Singapore at this wonderful restaurant. Nicole our waitress was just amazing and looked after us so well, talking us through the dishes and making suggestions and even moving our table to the window when one became available. The kitchen team produced wondrous food that kept on delighting us with the thought and precision in the preparation and delivery. I would definitely go there if you can afford the time. Yes the prices are in the top end of the market but to be honest we came away not worried as we had the best night of our 5 week trip.
5
we had a 6 cours menu which we loved. Always great to have the chef himslef at the table to explain The views on Singapore are unparalleled. Servive was great. Bonus was the free entrance to the 63 level highest outside lounge in the world. Defenitely a must if you visit Singapore. All in all noty a cheap evening, but it was worth it
5
The service from the moment we walked in was superb! The staff were all friendly and on the ball with a great sense of humour! The brunch was delicious!! A superb variety and nothing is too much of an effort! A lovely 2 piece band we're playing a few sets during the day and they played beautifully!! Loved the place!! Recommended!! Great view too!!
2
So ok we came here on the GP weeekend but there aren't so many people in the bar and for simple drinks you have to wait 15 minutes. The view is amazing but that doesn't mean that you have to provide poor service. Pick it up....
4
The Aussie Wagyu beef was outstanding. Staff and service were polite. cosy and comfy place with a great atmosphere & view.
4
Certainly one of the most impressive dinning locations in Singapore. Its pricey but its an experience that is world class. Service is impeccable. Whilst the gastro menu offers many courses you are not left either over full or wanting due to the small portion size.
5
A great night out to celebrate an anniversary. The food was stunning and the service was very attentive. We went for the 6 course Constellations Saturday night menu with the wine matching. The menu was well prepared and a testament to Chef Christopher Millar and his team. The waitress was very friendly and knew about each course in detail. Special shout out to the desserts, I read a negative review on this site and having tried the same thing it's only fair to say it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. The pavlova was wonderful and the valrhona cremeux out of this world. It represents good value for money given the experience and we would both recommend it highly. Usually Saturday nights have a spare table available so if you're thinking about a night out give them a call.
4
Its a beautiful room with a great view of Singapore and a very good idea for corporate entertaining. The service is prompt and professional but the staff is not as well trained and knowledgeable as Mee@OUE as a comparison. Menu is interesting and the Josper Grilled foods are always a good choice BUT the Steaks sometimes a little over cooked but all in all a great corporate lunch place

Being in Singapore for our own foodies week , we decided to try Stellar on a Sunday night . Firstly our hotel booked the table while we were in our club lounge with a request for a view . We firstly went to 1 altitude and went up to the rooftop bar . Don't get me wrong , the views are stunning , however I was a lot disappointed with the lack of service . Even when I went to the bar to get a cocktail , the bar staff made me wait while they prepared them , instead of offering to bring up the cocktail . Now the restaurant . Yes the service was attentive , the French guy at the start was nice , I would like to note that we were told that it was business casual , so we dressed nicely , however when we arrived we noticed a family of four in shorts and matching blue t - shirts plus sneakers , who had been allowed to sit at the restaurant , and on a table with a view . I don't hold it against them that they were allowed to do that , but when we were asked to dress nicely (specifically ) it was disappointing to see these guests there .The meal overall was nothing to write home about . We selected the three course meal . The Vegemite 'bite' from the chef and the eggplant 'smaller bite' from the chef were a nice touch , however the other meals were not good . My partner had gamberi prawn, I had scallop , it was one scallop and not exactly tasty . The prawn was reported to be unusually wrong . For dinner I had the truffle gnocchi , which was overcooked gnocchi in a green mush , my partner had the road to Tajima which attracted a $25 surcharge and this tasted a lot like the slow cooked lamb we have at home . Dessert was volcanic pavlova (chewy and couldn't finish ) plus styles of citron (nice but nothing I haven't had before )We also had some potato Thing with cauliflower , that tasted like a simple cauliflower bake .I was most disappointed about a couple of things:- we got back to the hotel to find that a surcharge had been added to the scallops , $15 , but cannot find why ? - the service was attentive , but they made no effort to accomodate our request for a window view , even though they shifted other couples to the window . - weirdly enough , not one person asked if we were or had enjoyed our meal ? Not one . It was like they were afraid of negative feedback . Also apart from two wait staff , the others would walk past and not acknowledge us .- the surcharges are just wrong . Set the price and if you need to , average out the menu to accomodate for any choice . Why charge extra for certain items ? If it was hard to source , or exotic , maybe , but put it as an upgrade , not as a surcharge . Make it simple and not confusing .We didn't mind - the atmosphere , but we can't comment on the view because our table had none , nor could we see one . - the service was nice . Polite . - Trying something different At the end of the day , choosing to go there is on us .Yep , the food wasn't great . Yep , we had no view .Yep , nobody asked how we enjoyed Yep , we found the menu and all it's catches , annoying .But , at the end of the day ,We chose to go there knowing full well it would cost lots and it was an experience we had , just know that there are plenty of high quality restaurants in singapore , with less hype and more than substance . Hope this review helps .

Spectacular views, attentive staff, delicious food, white linens and a good wine list. This place is beautiful but it is expensive. It will wow visitors & teenagers think it's really cool. Not somewhere I would take a young child. Would suggest sundowners @ the roof bar & enjoy the Marina Bay Sands Light show whilst enjoying your dinner.
4
I had 4 course set lunch which is good value. Little snacks and bread perfect. Foie Gras (big portion, although not all the membranes bits were removed, maybe some little cubes would have been nicer?) followed by beautiful zucchini soup. Main course was snapper which was perfectly cooked, but strawberry in salsa? No. The coconut cream dessert was good theatre to end the meal, would have liked some sour fruit to cut through the creamy sweetness. All this with the most amazing views: you don't need to pay for viewing from flyer!
5
We had booked for a special dinner at CE La Vi at the Marina Sands, but due to a large thunder/rain storm, couldn't get a taxi and so had to cancel our reservation and find something we could easily walk to in the bad weather. After a few false starts, we settled on Stellar, and had a wonderful meal. The view was amazing, in spite of the low clouds no rain, and the staff - led by our waiter, Jay - great. The food was also wonderful - and the desserts the best we have had in years. All in all, we feel lucky the evening worked out the way it did, and can't think we'd have had a better time at any of our preferred choices
2
A last minute lunch at Stellar. Don't know wat to expect cos first visit. Nice view. But i really think there is room for improvement for the food. Main dish chicken (plating was nice) was dry n a bit tasteless. My dessert was really disappointing. Again good presentation but is like just eating cream. Although is a promo menu, I really hope it can be better. Delicious gourmet doesn't mean using expensive ingredients. Lastly, the simple cup of latte presentation (see photo) really need to improve. All I can say, first impression lasts
4
I was there with my colleagues for lunch. As we are quite a big group, they actually gave us a private room. The place was cosy with a great atmosphere & definitely a great view. Love the mini dessert table too. Give it a try! It's just amazing. Oh ya! & not forgetting to join their membership for some "discount" too. hah
4
International selections, good spread of appetizers and salads, main course is relatively small, right sized for the Asians. Ambience is nicely matched with the awesome sunset viewed from the upper floor.
5
What a wonderful experience - absolutely beautiful setting with an amazing view across the city. Very imaginative and tasty food. Excellent service and presentation. I real must do in Singapore. Not much more to say except - pop up to the amazing rooftop bar afterwards.
5
Good wine selection, choice of 3 or 8-Constellation Course to choose from with or without wine pairing, attentive service staff... great place for a meal with family, or with couple of friends...
5
There are lots of rooftop places with views in the CBD, but Stellar certainly has the best. The open air, triangular rooftop bar gives you 360 view of the entire downtown (and further on clear days...all the way to Indonesia and across the center of Singapore). No cover at the rooftop bar if you have dinner reservations at Stellar (otherwise it's around $35 which includes a drink). Dinner was pricey but well-executed with some creative flair. The Aussie Wagyu beef was outstanding. Staff and service were lovely. Great for out of town visitors.
5
It's a wow view looking down on Marina Bay Sands, great to watch the light show and any fireworks from this location. The food and service is excellent - its not a cheap evening out and has a dress requirement. Check on the web site -
5
My hubby chose this place to celebrate our anniversary, we had a very beautify memory with wonderful service provided by EDDIS who offered his service to take photo for us, even made a nice photo frame for us, he is a funny guy, make us laugh a lot, and treat us a glass of wine for our special day, we both did enjoy his service and the experience the Stellar is fantastic. Recommended to my friend who want to celebrate special day here
4
This is not the usual run of the mill restaurants. Want to celebrate a special occasion? Want to have dinner with that special someone? Want to dine at a place worth remembering with fond memories? Come here. But be prepared to spend as like I say it's not a run of the mill restaurant so therefore money should never be a concern. Great Memories are made of these
5
My husband took me to Stellar for my birthday dinner which also happened to fall on National Day (9 August) so we were treated to a spectacular view that also happened to have fireworks that night! The food was simply put, French fine dining done right. Service was good. We had dedicated service to our table and the whole experience was perfect
5
We had a window table in almost private area. We had beautiful but almost scary views overt the city. Service was excellent, great meat and wine selection. Dessert was flaming and very entertaining, but also tasty! Quality and price go hand in hand here. After dining, we got an access to top floor, we went just to see the view. I strongly recommend
3
went with great expectations hence the disappointment. food was pretty ok but service was so-so. no smiles, no personable staff at ground floor reception. service in resto was at best mediocre. reto had no ambience during the day as it was just too hot and glaring. some day curtains would help to reduce the uncomfortable glare.
4
My boyfriend and I had a wonderful dining experience at Stellar. Eddie and Theresa were extremely meticulous and attentive to us throughout the dinner. Both of them asked if we've enjoyed the dishes from time to time, and offered to feedback to the chef when we have comments on the food. Theresa was really warmth and friendly, and we enjoyed our conversations with her. The dishes were nicely plated and presented. Portion could be abit small for some of the dishes, but our stomaches were comfortably filled at the end of the whole dinner. Must-tries includes the Valrhona cremeux (chocolate dessert), Maine lobster and Live jade abalone with foie gras
5
this is the second time i have been to 1-altitude. once for drinks in the evening and to watch the sun set and today was for lunch. i love the ride up to the 62 floor. it doesn't make me dizzy cos the elevator has glass and view of the exterior. the service staff are very attentive. i met with the dining manager as i wanted to view the private dining rooms. there are 2 rooms which have excellent views. the kitchen is open concept, so you could them prepare the food. the view is remarkable. where we were seated, overlooks the marina bay area. the plating of the dishes we selected from the monthly set lunch menu are very nice. the salmon was so fresh and delicious as was the sorbet. loved the jazz music that was played but not too loudly. overall, i would recommend this place for the view and service
5
View was fantastic,Eddie the waiter gave us excellent service advised us to order meal and then go up to rooftop bar and watch the sunset which was brilliant,he even came up and joined us for photos and pointed out points of interest.returned to restaurant where we had wonderful meal,an all round great experience.Thanks very very much EDDI
5
It was really great time in the restaurant. I and my wife were well welcomed by "Theresa (thank you so much again!)" and all courses were well presented and served by a chef and staff. It was not crowded as it's Sunday dinner hence it was just nice to enjoy our dinner in very peaceful and comfortable atmosphere. (If you visit this restaurant during weekday lunch, it should be more quite and cozy). I love thier foods, Although I am not good at tasting foods, I could feel and taste the story of foods. From the beginning to the end, it was just perfectly served and presented. In particular, the desert was just art. The chef came to our table and prepare the last desert with his passion and artistic skill. Just love it!You can consider about the price (I spent over $400), but it is worthy as you can enjoy their foods, service and amazing panoramic view from your table. In my opinon, the price does not only include the foods you having but also service and atmosphere you enjoy in the restaurant. If you have a very special day, you should make a reservation otherwise, it is hard to reserve your table with nice view. I do truly recommend to you if you are looking a fine dine to celebrate something with your love one.

At Level 62, we could enjoy the breathe-taking view of CBD & Marina Bay area and the vast blue sea.Good customer service by the Stewards/Stewardess.Special thanks to Theresa for her attentiveness as she could recognize we are not exactly pleased with the Wagyu beef and offered a change.Dishes are excellently garnished and pleasing to the eyes.Unfortunately, we couldn't have similar praise for the dishes.The wagyu beef wasn't as tender & juicy as we expected, and the sea bass was missing freshness after deep fried.The dessert was beautiful to the eyes, but unattractive to the tongue.Bringing it altogether, no big doubts about the culinary skill of the chefs, quality of the ingredients probably did the most injustice
5
I was there with friends to celebrate my birthday. The ambient was good with the fantastic view and nice food. It was totally a different experience. I would like to thank Shankar who served us for the night. He is so kind, helpful and patient with all the funny questions we put up to him. He also take the initiative to take a group picture for us and help to print the copies for all. I really appreciate his service and would like to say thank you to him. Shankar is the best. :-)
4
Stellar at 1-Altitude is a dining experience that I could recommend to anyone visiting Singapore. The ambience is great with a view of the Marina Bay Sands. The dining experience was great with interactive sessions with the chef. Special mention to Theresa who entertained us with her bubbly personality

My fiance and I excitedly attended this restaurant as a special date night. When reserving told the window seating cant be guaranteed as it is first come first served. When we arrived there was a no seat available but one minute later a window table was opened we asked to change and were told no we couldn't. The table sat unattended for the remainder of our meal and by dessert time we were asked if we would like to have dessert by the window. By this time we had had enough of this place and declined . The food was well presented but far too pretentious given the fact that it was tasteless. The photo they give you is a decent touch but i don't think it even mde it back to the Pan Pacific. The night has given us a lot to laugh about and a new phrase "a Stellar moment" whenever we encounter something pretending to be better than it was. Also whenever encountering someone who is incompetent we will say we just have to get through this Stellar waiter first. So on the memories and lesson learned front it gets average. Brace yourself for 40 dollar double Grey Gooses but you will need a few to get through the experience.
1
Food and view are very good, I guess as most of people I went there for the view.However, service is really average, don't feel like really comfortable at all with it, service very slow, it took 3 hours to get all our small dishes to be served, I was still hungry at the end. And to end up, price is amazingly expensive
5
Their service level is so high that even when i requested a glass of warm water, Theresa - one of the waitresses that served us for the night, gave me a pot of lukewarm water so that the water stayed warm throughout the dinner! Another waitress - Nicole, had patiently explained everything to us and coordinated the surprise for my birthday there are too many other good waitresses so please forgive me if I can't remember your name. Thanks Stellar for the good food and best services!
4
Nice food, very fresh and really tasty. The view is amazing. Go the at night, SIngapore ist beautful then!
Did not made my top score because of the lack of parking and the prices are a bit too high.
2
Didnt like the food and it is also very expensive especially if you order a bottle of wine. Will not go back
5
We were there for dinner and choose 3 courses menu. Lot of variety and for me a good combination. Every dishes were very delicious. Our main, lobster and grill beef, were second to none that we have had. Much more than we expect from a nice view restaurant. Decoration made you feel at ease so can be relax all the time. Last but not least, friendly and yet excellent service by Darinka add more enjoyable moment. We are all agreed to return again. Many interesting dishes are waiting
5
If you can afford it I'd definitely recommend giving this a place a spin. You're 62 floors up in the sky overlooking the Bay, food is amazing and the service couldn't have been better. We went for the 8 course menu and would recommend it. There wasn't a thing we didn't like and they make your desert on the table at the end which added another element to it all. Our waiter was Eddie (guy in the photo) and I can't remember having anyone better. He cracked some good jokes to lighten the atmosphere and really put us at ease. Sometimes Michelin star restaurants can seem a little uptight and stuffy, but it certainly wasn't the case here. Not only that but he even threw in a few free drinks to complement certain dishes. The cherry on top was he took our photo at the start of the night and presented it in a frame at the end.Exceeded all expectations and was one of the best nights we've ever had in restaurant

Whenever I visit home to Singapore I will try my best to visit Stellar. Simply because of its excellent food, great service and amazing view. There are not many restaurants in my travels that I call "home" and for visiting Stellar its like going home.Excellent food, the photos posted explains itself but whats more important is staff go through great lengths to accommodate special requests. Service from staff is top notch where detailed attention is rendered to all guests from my observation but one thing that impressed me is the knowledge of the staff on the food. Thanks to Eddie who serves me each time I visit, the friendliness, care and knowledge always impress me

Elegant restaurant in perfect location to explore Singapore CBD, the view was amazing, the staff were friendly especially Eddie, thank you for looking after us with your smile and energy on our anniversary night 21/4/17 despite the fact that i was a little under the weather. We would like to personally thank Eddie, the handsome & the most polite, helpful gentleman, he really stands out & deserves to have a bigger career in his life. We truly enjoyed the night and the meals..the Turbot, the Gruyer souffle with everything else and oh the Truffle Latte was really the bomb, we wanted the recipe! The ambience from 62nd floor, definitely the place to wow your date

We came for an anniversary dinner and knew the view would be great but weren't so sure how the food would be. We were shown to our table, but the waiter, who was excellent, suggested we head up top to the bar for a drink, snap a few pics (he took some for us) while the sun goes down. In terms of view and accessibility this is much better than the top of MBS. The view was amazing, 360 degrees, you can see Sumatra from there, looking down on Marina Bay and all of Singapore. If you're visiting Singapore, I'd recommend this over the over priced top of Marina Bay Sands. After the drink we went down for dinner and got the degustation menu. The food was good. You wouldn't come here just for the food, but it was good enough and price according to quality (if I remember right the set was ~$115 per person). We didn't get the wine pairing. The tables and chairs in the restaurant and general decor in the restaurant was more link a banquet at a hotel, so it doesn't feel premium. If you want to impress a date or just want a generally dramatic location this is a safe option, especially if you have visitors from out of town or you are out of town yourself. There's really no better view than this

WARNING! This restaurant is a ripoff! they show a cheaper menu at 130 S$ and you end up at 200$! the food is less than average for such a price! Furthermore they close the roof deck because of a storm but never reopened it long after the storm had gone!It is ok to have drink at the roof deck for the view but avoid the Stellar restaurant at all cost

We went here for a business event.Food was from a fixed group menu with some choices on the main and starter.Steak was very nice, chicken was ok, not special.The amuse really bad.Dessert greatThe view is amazing.Unfortunately we couldnt end the evening at the rooftop as the weather was very bad

First time having a meal at Stellar. Most restaurants in Raffles Place, especially one located at the top-most level of the building would be of a certain standard. Stellar had the most terrible service staff and it was embarrassing hosting a business lunch. Food presentation was very nice but taste was lacking. There was a business set meal but it wasn't of good value and not worth the bad experience. To make it worse, my boss was present and hosting lunch. Really bad idea. Will not go back.

Wonderful lunch with my daughter & parents visiting from UK
And all the more memorable because of the fantastic service from our waiter Eddy.
Thank you - you made our day 😊

We had Wagyu beef and was perfect. The service was good, Eddie was helpful and attentive.
The dessert white peach was impressive too.
3
Food was a tad disappointing but it because i had high expectation for such a place. Lovely ambience although my dining mate feels the deco and table setting can be improved. Food was rather mediocre.
4
We went here just before sunset to have dinner. The 6-course meal was great. The food was delicious but to set the expectations right its abit on the pricier side. The presentation of the meal was nice if you are into food-gasm, taking pictures and posting it on online. Everything was prepared after you order and it is fresh. The ambiance of the place is great. The dessert was spectacular, they prepped it up right before our eyes with a show, did some blow torch on the sides and viola! The hostess was nice and polite, she was very accommodating especially its our first time here. On my view, this is a place where you can have business meetings, date with your GF, celebrate with family kind of things while having dinner. This place is fine dining at its best

Organised a small private lunch event at this venue. EXTREMELY Unaccommodating with pre-event preparation requirements, this venue expects clients to compromise their event plans to suit their own convenience. Despite run sheet provided, meal service was delayed grotesquely while restaurant staff remains nonchalant. When asked exactly how much longer do my guests have to wait for their mains, staff replied "the Chef says that it will be ready when it is ready". Unbelievable! Obviously aware that things are not going well, restaurant manager was hiding throughout the entire four hours. Snotty outfit, traumatising service and mediocre food, take your money elsewhere.
2
The location and view are stellar and sadly it ends there. Everything else goes downhill from there - callous, Groucho Marx of a manager who tried and failed miserably at serving wine! to the inattentive waitstaff.Amuse bouche was ok- nothing stellar.Opted for set lunch and maybe it's a lunch thing. But If you cannot do lunches just open for dinner-period!Blue cheese soufflé - partly bad choice, should have stuck to tomato tartare.Nothing light and fluffy about it and accompanied by salty rocket salad?!Main course - not so fresh blue clams and pasta that any average restaurant would serve. Tad salty and just underwhelming..I returned mostly uneaten pasta but no one even bothered to check what was wrong ?! (Stellar service - NOT)Dessert was a deconstructed pinacolada. Not bad..My expectations went from level 62 to the harsh reality on ground zero in no time. Not in a rush to get back here anytime soon!

This is billed as the worlds highest restaurant and at 67 floors above Singapore we expected stunning views. We were extremely disappointed- small windows surrounded by mirrors that created confusion in what was being viewed. The staff were focussed on increasing your spend in their "suggestions" rather than ensuring your meal suited your needs we felt. The quality of the food was good but not excellent. All in all a disappointing evening. The food/service/views at Sky on 57 and The Lighthouse were far superior
5
Dined alone while my husband was out on a business dinner meeting. The concierge at our hotel recommended Stellar. He called ahead and reserved a small table, by the window with a magnificent view. I was able to see the laser show at the Marina Sands while I enjoyed my fantastic dinner. I chose the 8 course set menu and was surprised at every course. Presentation was amazing and so was my waiter, Eddie. I loved the palette cleansing course when I was invited to watch the chef make a liquid nitrogen frozen dollop of lemon meringue. So much fun! Afterwards, Eddie insisted on giving me a brief tour of the rooftop bar, tallest in the city. What a view. One of the most memorable meals I have ever had and I was so disappointed that my foodie husband missed it! Next trip to Singapore

Stellar At 1-Altitude would probably not be an unfamiliar name.Perched high on level 62 of One Raffles Place, the restaurant is synonymous with quality fine-dining while offering a spectacular view of Singapore's city skyline. Not surprisingly, it is the choice for many when it comes to selecting a venue for that romantic night out or celebratory occasion.The following 6 course constellation dinner was chosen for tonight dinner.AUTUMN GASTRONOMIC6 COURSE CONSTELLATION $120++1) Live Jade Abalone | foie gras | morel(supplement $10)2) Carabineros prawn | parmesan cream | egg yolk in smoked oil | bacon ash(supplement $10)3) Truffle latte | true macaronTrip to the Garden | Nitro poached lemon meringue | fresh herb dust4) French wild skate wing | kohlrabi remoulade | cont potato | hazelnut and capers5) Maine lobster | true risoni | girolle | pancetta | pine nuts(supplement $25)6) DESSERT ART(live plated by the dessert chef beside our table)A Platter for twin sharingBACON & EGGSSheep’s milk yoghurt | Elderower honey | bacon soilLICHU CHOCOLATE PARFAITBee pollen | honey grand marnier | lemon balmAll in all, it was a satisfying dining experience at Stellar.

It's a place to check when you are visiting Singapore but you probably are coming back only to attend a party or a friends gathering. View is nice and have a good atmosphere but good food and drinks you can have anywhere else with lower cost. It is a one-time experience
5
Great food, excellent services, beautiful view, I have a wonderful memories. Recommend to at least visit once.
5
This restaurant the views were amazing although it was raining.
We had the set 3 course menu with added supplement.
The wine was nice and chilled and the food was of the highest quality and the presentation to match.
Well worth coming here.
5
I was served by Eddie personally and it was a really great service! Bringing my girlfriend and I to the rooftop for photo taking with the nice scenery, and when we came down, he took another picture of us dining. He gave us the hard copy of the photo as well. It is definitely a well spent anniversary dinner
5
Went for lunch today. We did make a booking but was told the window seats come in on first serve first arrive basis. Which I was glad they informed me because I originally booked for 1 pm and changed too to 12pm. We arrived at 12 and got the seats we hoped for and quickly afterwards the window seats were gone. They had a set lunch menu and the food was great. Great value and also yummy. Service was good. Views to die for. Overall very please. Wine was a little pricey but that is the normal when in Asia.
3
Dined here with a bigger group of colleagues, it was a great experience. The view is fantastic and the rooftop bar provides a great option for a few post dinner drinks.We went for a fixed price tasting menu, surprisingly quite a lot of the dishes had surcharges - would welcome a clearer pricing structure.Food was ok, slightly behind expectation if you factor in the price.Our waitress must have been there for less then a week - clearly you want one of your most experienced staff to take care of a large group. Couldn't pour wine & beer whiteout spilling it... - disappointed.Hopefully there are better restaurants in the neighbourhood...
4
Had a nice quiet dinner at the restaurant before proceeding to the bar. The food quality and presentation was to be expected, at a hefty price tag for the set menu. However, it was the night views under the open sky on the rooftop that sealed a memorable evening. It was a pity it had rained earlier in the evening, so the outdoor seats were wet.... Still, it did not detract from gorgeous views of the CBD area in Singapore, enlivened by the live band playing in the background. I will prefer to opt for drinks at the rooftop in future
3
Fantastic view of the Singapore skyline and on good days, Ben the Indonesian islands of Batam. However nothing much can be said of the food, which to be is way below the "fantastic" level. That does not mean its bad either, just that it fails to live up to the hype sorroudning this establishment and the price that one pays
3
They have an outstanding view on the city, but as soon as I did try to take a picture of the view the security came to me and physically grabbed my arm to stop me, saying I can only take pictures of the inside of the place. What's the point of coming to the 68th floor of a building with an outstanding view of the city of Singapore if I can't take a picture? No explanation given on the reason. My guess is that there must be some sensitive locations such as army base or government buildings and for this reason it is not permitted to take pictures of the view. Sad
4
Beautiful experience with spetacular view and tasty food. Saw 1 minutes Chinese New Year firework from where we were sited. Our special thanks to Eddie. We had lots of time to enjoy the food, walk up to the rooftop to view the beautiful day and night view of my city
3
We signed up for the New Year's Eve set dinner, the food was good but the portions were small. What was surprising was that we were charged more than $150 just for 2 open glasses of red wine and a bottle of water!!
5
Food, view, staff, ambient all amazing. Great selection of vines. Try to get a table by the window, it's worth it. Gabriel made our visit very special.
4
A very nice buffet lunch. Not too crowded with good table spacing and not at all noisy. Food selection was good but not as wide as other buffets and of course the views.
5
This place is an awesome place. The service provided by the service personnels were excellent as they were able to recommend the best wine choice for me.
4
A very nice place to chill with with friends and family and also gathering. with nice foods and friendly staff.
5
My favourite restaurant so far. Great food with excellent service. They can never fail to impress me!
4
Wide variety of food choices for dinner. Prices are also very reasonable. Certainly value for money.
2
Before coming to the restaurant we had high expectations but we left very disappointed. Agree, the restaurant offers a great view over Marina Bay, but the rest of our dining experience was rather disappointing. We ordered a 3 course menu and we had to wait over 1 hour to receive our starters. No excuse or gesture from the service staff or management. The couple sitting next to us asked for the cheque after not receiving their food either and left hungry. Another 1/2 hour later we received our main course, unfortunately my beef steak was lukewarm and that of my wife cold. When the dessert was served, about 2 1/2 hours later we only wanted to leave the place.Last but not least the decor is rather outdated and the ambiance rather cold.Hard to believe this restaurant gets that much good ratings..
4
Went here for dinner on the 30th of December, without a booking and got in, nice little restaurant with a good atmosphere, however air con was extremely cold! The degistation is nice and quite filling, but the service or lack there of was a little disappointing for the price. Many staff running around looking busy however only one waiter was serving the whole place
1
Except the spectacular views, the restaurant is a disappointment. Overly expensive for a below average food menu, would not recommend it to anyone. And in case you still want to try it, bring a worm sweater as it's freezing up there, air con is set to compete to an arctic outdoor eve
5
Made reservation at this place for its view and it surprised us with its excellent food, with all dishes given a thumbs up. We ordered the oysters n snow crab for starters, lobster risotto and tenderloin beef for mains and ended off with the peach sorbet and chocolate parfait for dessert. A memorable birthday celebration indeed.
4
The restaurant offers fine dining with a great view of the Singapore Marina Bay area. The best time to visit is between 6.30 pm to 8.00 pm where you can get to see the transformation of the Marina Bay from daylight to nightlight. Awesome sight.
4
Very nyc restro.. food , cocktails nd service is awsum. Being there was like walking in the sky.
I loved it.
3
Great views with great service but the food did not wow me for the price. It was unfaulted but did not have the wow factor. Labyrinth offers far more uniqueness for the same price.
5
This is definitely one of the finest restaurants in Singapore that has a very high level of service and food quality as it is. The dishes are very sophisticated and the landscape showed from the table is priceless! In between dishes you can go upstairs to the bar and smoke or get some fresh air. Overall - great experience and an absolute must if you happen to get to the area
5
It will cost you 30 Singapore dollars to get in but it comes with one drink. Really great views, fun music. Go at night as the light up all the tables.
1
Unbelievably dated atmosphere inside, from tablecloth, decoration (not much of in first place), made worse if you happen to sit right in the back near entrance. I heard that they charge more for tables near window (we didn't even try to book) which is ridiculous practice IMHO. Saw the chef went around the restaurant very often most likely to greet his special guests but not even once he smiled or greeted us, whereas we were there splurging on champagne and truffle. We do not want to be treated differently but a little gesture or "hi I hope you enjoy the food" goes a long way in guest's memory. Will not come back
5
I went here for my first time, and also to propose to my fiancÃ©. The waiter Eddie, was amazing. Went out of his way to make it go perfectly, he was kind, funny and made the night memorable. if you get service, get Eddie, he was the best. The food and the view was amazing, will definitely be bac

Having a meal on the 62nd floor is extraordinary and comes with an awesome view of the city and skyline. While the food tasted okay and despite some rave reviews, I found it did not meet expectations, as much as the fantastic view and experience.It was very dark in the restaurant, so the photos came out similarly
5
We arrived for the first sitting at 6.30pm . I cannot tell you enough how attentive and accommodating the staff were. The views from the restaurant are breathtaking (we were able to see the light show at the Marina Bay Gardens). The food itself was amazing and by the time I had finished all the courses and the dessert, I was stuffed but oh so happy (my sister and I had the constellation degustation which I thoroughly recommend). A particular thank you to Jackleh our server on the night and Sasha the Assistant Dining Manager who went above and beyond. Nice touch was the Sous Chef making the Dessert at our table and the photo at the end of our visit too. Will definitely come here again when I'm in Singapore
5
My sister and I booked dinner at Stellar for the first night of our trip to Singapore because we'd heard good things but the night far surpassed our expectations! We arrived early for our 6.30pm booking so we had a cocktail at Altitude upstairs while we waited. The views of Marina Bay Sands and the entire CBD were breathtaking! The staff at the bar were friendly and even snapped a picture for us with the most amazing background. When we headed back to Stellar we were seated at a fabulous corner table right near the window and drink orders were taken straight away (Note: the lychee martinis are deadly!). We were very well looked after during the night by our server Jackleh, the assistant dining manager Sasha and another lovely Filipina who's name I regrettably missed.As for the food, we ordered the seasonal 6 course autumn gastronomic and I doubt my words can do it justice. The experience was MAGICAL! Everything was delicious but my favourites were the oysters with a jelly pouch which burst in the mouth, prawn carabineros with a poached egg yolk and cream cheese froth, truffle latte with macaron and the desert which was served in front of us by the pastry chef herself. Each dish was flawless but the hospitality we received from everyone at Stellar was really what made the night.It was not cheap but our dinner at Stellar will definitely remain the highlight of our trip and we will recommend it to anyone looking for a special place to eat while visiting. They even took a photo of us with our special dessert to keep which was a lovely touch. We were so full when we left and Sasha took us back up to Altitude so we could finish the night off with one last drink overlooking the beautiful (now night) skyline. Would do again in a heartbeat
5
Had dinner with my wife over here, and its service is top notched. food is exquisite and delicious as always. overall great restaurant/bar.
4
To enjoy a good drink in your hand and look over the city lights after a hard day's work , there's no better view to relax or entertain friends but here up At Altitude One
4
nice place to celebrate birthday with pricey. the food there was just so so, but dessert was very creative.
5
The food is good but the thing that strikes me the most is the unparalled service. Some may like it but I feel it is too intense.
5
This restaurant was AMAZING:1. My wife and I are vegetarians. We didn't like the menu so the chef made us each our own unique meal. It was GREAT.2. The views are spectacular - Make sure you get a seat by the window.3. Eddie was our waiter and he was GREAT. Ask for him. He told us all about Singapore, etc. Spent just the right amount of time with us (not too much, not too little). He's the best!4. The meal was $310SGD. That's pricey, but the food was amazing. We only had 3 drinks.5. The dessert was so delicious. My wife's dessert had dry ice under the plate. Eddie poured water on it and it fogged up. It was really cool.This restaurant does not sacrifice food quality for location. It's the total package
5
Had a wonderful dinner with my husband and our god-daughter to celebrate her 19th birthday. Eddie took great care of us and definitely made Briana (birthday girl) feel exceptionally special as this is her first fine dining experience. The view definitely was a major plus to the wonderful ambience and food. A must visit for anybody wishing to experience great food and service in Singapore.
4
We came here for the 5-course dinner meal which I would rate 3.5 out of 5.Although the dishes were well made, but since Truffle was the flavour of the month at that point and we dont like truffles much, we couldnt appreciate some of the courses in the mealThe desserts were pretty creative and tasted wonderful.Book a table around 7 PM by the window, you wouldnt regret it. One of the best evening views in the city
5
Appetiser: Pantry Taster (Classic Foie Gras Parfait on Brioche, Juniper and Gin Marinate Ocean Trout Gravadlax, Fig and Caramelised Onion and Manchego tart, Olives & Sundried Tomato Pesto)Soup: Lobster Bisque (Truffled Prawn and leek Totellini)Main: Poached Angus Tenderloin (Cauliflower and Truffle Puree, Roast Garlic Cream, Broccolini and Morel Sauce)Dessert: Assiette Platter ( Praline Cake, Koi, Blanc Manger, Valrhona Cremeux, Extra Virgin Olive Oil Ice Cream)One word: WOW. The menu is the most interesting I have seen so far! Just look at the desserts! Where else are you able to get Olive Oil Ice Cream!Of course, not forgetting that the major plus point is definitely the beautiful skyline of Singapore. Splendid
4
The view was stunningly beautiful as we enjoyed the rooftops view of buildings around Singapore's Esplanade.Amuse servings were tiny but the rich flavours that went into it was delightful. The beef medium done hubby had was told to be juicy. The maine lobster was a tad unexpected, presented all chopped up in something like a pallea concoction. Desserts were very unique though. Hubby's parfait was served in smoke! Quite an entertaining experience.We dined on a weeknight and found all window seats taken. Would recommend you to make reservations in advance!They did nothing special for hubby's birthday celebration. Fortunately the chef's interesting presentation made up for it
3
Celebrated my birthday with my 3 other friends at Stellar at 1-Altitude on 26 Sep 2016 (Monday). We have each ordered a 3 course meal and these were what we've ordered:Starter. Daily Live Oysters (x 2)- we love it Starter. Wood Fire Cauliflower - kinda of saltyStarter. Truffle Latte - we love itMain. Aglio Uni (King Crab) - way too salty!Main. Turbot - average tasteMain. Poulet Noir - bad! The smell of the chicken meat was too strongMain. Maine Lobster - The best out of the 4 mainsDesserts. White Peach - we love itDesserts. Style of Citron - our favouriteDesserts. Valrhona Cremeux - we love it Desserts. Lichu Chocolate Parfait - we love itIronically everything else was good except for the mains. I'm not too sure if we could call this fine dinning because the experience dinning here was pretty much like a average restaurant. 1. No one came to our table to speak about the ingredients that were used for all of the dishes. 2. A male waiter had a really grumpy face like he was having the worse day of his life. 3. It was a Monday night and we aren't good drinkers so we had skipped the wine. He didn't seem really happy about our decision tho and we were given a judgemental look. 4. As the mains were soooo salty, we asked for ice water to be refilled a few rounds. On one occasion, he raise his hand in my friend's face gesturing to wait (without speaking since he was just beside our table). I thought it was quite rude, wouldn't have thought this is appropriate.Our experience there weren't a great one and having said the food were all good except for the mains (ironically). I don't think I would make a revisit but very much contented having the opportunity to try/dine there
4
This award wining estaurant with very attentive staff offers reasonably decent meals with the best view of the Singapore skyline, by day and by night. Highly recommended if you want to impress your guests or foreign visitors with the panoramic meal.
5
Good to book in advance to avoid disappointment. Lunch is cheaper than dinner. Have not been to dinner but set lunch was good with variety of delicious desserts.
2
Service was not attentive, and seemed unwilling.
Good was great, except for the mains. We had the fish (4) and the beef ribs (1). Each one of the fish was consistently overdone. The beef ribs were dry, and the side mash was terrible.
5
Incredible view! Amazing food and superb wine! A fantastic experience! take the time to visit and enjoy the experience.
4
Wonderful views of Marina Bay, and inventive cuisine. Set menus have a good array of choices and the tasting menu seems good value for money.
5
A good friend was in town and I suggested one of my favorite restaurants. Gabriel as always was so attentive and ensured we were well looked after almost to the point of spoiling us both. He even helped us to take pics. A big kudos to Chris Millar for never sitting on his laurels. The wine pairing menu is well thought out and executed to perfection which leaves one's palate craving for more.
4
Have been here before but not for a while - the food is excellent, real 5* dining and incredibly affordable. The service was also great - Eddie was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and professional and really went the extra mile to make our farewell lunch memorable.I'd like to note to the management team there though that it's a real shame the two course option is no longer available (we were allowed to have it as it was still on the website). Two courses is perfect for a lunchtime restaurant in this area (CBD), it's enough food in enough time for the right price ($38++). It has to be noted that previous visits were packed and it was difficult to get a reservation. This time there were lots of empty tables which adds nothing to the atmosphere..overall - aside from the individual staff, it seemed a bit "closed" - no one greeted us on arrival - there was always a welcome desk. Is it closing soon? Pity if so - the chef is gifted. Food and presentation worthy of a top eatery so have a rethink and reintroduce a proper business lunch, put some music on and make it great again

Went there for a birthday celebration, everything was fine in the beginning we were attended by a female waitress that tell us all the detail about the appetiser. Then a whole group of guest came in. Then we were served by another male waiter who was really unprofessional. When ask for more water by my friends he use his hand to gesture to wait and he goes off. He came back without using any service language he just pour the water and walk off. No smile or no respond when we said thank you despite the bad service. No service finesse at all for such a high end restaurant. He seems smiling with other customers (a group of Caucasian) but not toward us (Asian) felt discriminated. The main that I had 'Poulet Noir' the chicken taste like it has been in the freezer for at least 2-3days. It has the taste of fridge, taste really bad. The male waiter clear our main and just place the cutlery and the dessert without even saying anything. Personally I find it inappropriate for such behaviour in such a high end restaurant. Such a disappointment for the price we paid ($488.50 for 4 pax). Won't recommend this place to any Friends as for the amount you paid here you could get a better food as well as better service. This will definitely the first and last Time I'm going
2
We had high expectations and had reserved this for a special occasion. Do not do like we did. To start with, only half of the restaurant was opened and the other half closed behind a curtain of some sort. So you only had the view on one side. The waitress was so kind to show us the other side, but of course didn't change the ambiance. Still she did her very best and throughout the evening she was very helpful. But even with half the restaurant open (mind you that they make you wait downstairs in a queue even if you have a reservation, like you're waiting in line to see a celebrity or something - this is really very boring and we had to wait for quite some time even though we were exactly on time, it's one of those things that they want to make you feel small and you are just very lucky to be allowed to have dinner there, that is the impression we got even though we came with such a positive attitude), even half of that was empty. So really no atmosphere at all, incredibly boring. We couldn't believe what we experienced. We had one of the menus and the food was OK I guess, but definitely far from spectacular. Some parts of it looked stunning, but then the taste didn't follow... We were really so disappointed that we went for after dinner drinks upstairs to the bar, but that was even worse. It was only about 10pm or so and although there was not a single soul dancing, the music was so loud you could not talk to one another. So we didn't even have a drink and left. We then headed to Lantern where we had quite a number of drinks and lots of laughs. But I would not recommend Stellar at 1-Altitude to anyone that I care about
3
Recently with colleagues we went to Stellar for lunch. It is been a while since I last been there but I have to say, venue is still one of the better ones due to the outstanding view. Food, aesthetically pleasant. Breakdown the High and Low for the food.The appetiser scallop was quite disappointing as it came out rather chewy. This means it's been left some time waiting to be served under the heated lamp. COD for main superbly done yummy. I give this 4.5 stars, half star taken out just cos the accompanying salad is rather plain and not complimentary to the cod.Desserts another disappointment, green tea soufflÃ© too sweet and too wet. Tea and coffee too slow in service...Overall would I go again...yes but not too soon, too many rooftop resturants around to try. I say give ME@OUE and Artemis Grill a try
4
Great view and super friendly staff, who moved us to a window table whenever it became available. The crab and truffle risotto was to die for. The restaurant was however a little empty and lacking atmosphere
5
Eddie made the entire dining experience amazing, beyond just wonderful. From his light bantering and warmth hospitality, to extra attentive service, he brought our dinner dishes to live, adding an extra dimension to the already exquisite tastes.
5
As soon as we steped out of the taxi we were treated like royalty by the friendly staff. All of the food was exquist and came quickly, combined with the breathtaking views and deligtful service from Eddie, it made for an incredible evening.

Disappointed I read good reviews of this place and decided to take my overseas guests here. I wrote email to them 1 week before and again 1 day before as I've to change my reservation from 4pax to 6pax. They reply promptly and even give me a call the day itself. I told them I'll be there by 6pm to have a drink and have specifically told them I've overseas guest. They only replied that they won't hold my table longer than 15min. The only reason why I want to choose Stella is so for my guest to experience the wonderful view of their open air rooftop bar drinks prior to dinner. Arrive at 6pm and they told us Rooftop bar was close temporary till not sure when. I asked the reservation lady why didn't she mention that on her 4 emails to me? She said she only knew about it just now. And was not apologetic at all. Dinner started well with our server sounding bright and chirpy. All of us aren't big eaters so decided to opt for 3 course menu. The starter was interesting. Main course is VERY ordinary. 3 of us have steak which looks so boring it makes me want to head to CUT immediately. Dessert was so-so, the cheese platter I've to say is good. Some of us had sparkling water while 2 have Tap water. 2 tap water can never be refilled and we've to constantly ask for it. Wine by the glass is average and price is ok SGD 20 a glass but selection is poor. Overall, 6 pax - 3 course dinner with 2 bottles of wine + 2 glass. Bill was SGD 1.142K. Our chirpy server performance dwindled as we started our main course. He doesn't seem interested to serve our table and disappeared when we wanted to bill. I would never come back again as it is so unmemorable. Make Tippling Club, Rhubarb, and Cut look so superior just that they don't have the "view"

Stellar is the perfect place to celebrate a visitor's birthday. The food is delicious, the view amazing. However, it is not worth booking it if you can't get one by the window. It is also important to go before the night fall to admire the view and the sunset. Although it is a good place, the bar above is much more happening and for me a better offer
3
Tried the lunch-set. Starter & main were mediocre, which was disappointing given that the place was highly raved. Fine dining experience & admostphere, which were great. However, the food standard have lots of room for improvement to match the whole experience. Only their dessert was impressive imo, especially the nitrogen-icecream. If i ever go back again, it will be for their dessert
5
Our visit to Stellar Restaurant was all that we had imagined and more. The food was exquisite and adequately portioned, the staff helpful and prompt at considering our requests. We had subzero Mojitos, which were both a visual spectacle and a refreshing delight. The view of the Bay that even allowed us to catch the lights show on the water, provided for the exclusivity that we were craving. Singapore is an expensive city and so is this restaurant, but for us it was worth it
4
It's my second visit at this pleasant restaurant. Managed to scroll through some of the previous reviews left my the past patrons and thought more positive feedbacks would do this place good. My boyfriend and myself have been to other places for fine dining before and the quality of food is definitely of high standard. Was it by luck both experiences we had at this place was simply above expectations. Or was it just that the rest who left negative remarks have a higher expectations to what fine dining is. This month they are serving the truffle menu. From the truffle latte. To the truffle risotto (only place with the tastiest risotto-quite hard to fine nice ones in SG. Either too hard or too bland). Not forgetting our dedicated server of the night, EDDIE. Cheerful chap who claims to be a foreigner but i couldnt tell if he didnt say. He was very attentive to not only us, and also to the rest of erm about 7 tables, some with 4 or even 6 diners? (It's a sunday so lesser patrons i guess)EDDIE is also knowledgeable about the food and ingredients he is serving, what they taste like and where they come from. A BIG plus. He made every other patrons around smiling during the whole night (i am an observant person) The pace of food being served was quite fast today i thought, maybe just so to improve from the previous feedbacks others had given. which i remembered even my first time here a few months ago was good enough, when i could enjoy the view and food while the next course took the right time to be served. I would say give this place a try to give your own review. It's really not bad at all. Call my review bias, but u never know till you try it.I hope stellar can keep up with the positive experience and tasty food. I kind of miss the sashimi which you guys had a while back but too but the ala carte menu is gon

Stellar has a wonderful location... Too bad they couldn't match that with their service and food. Our reservation time was 6:30 and we were promptly seated... Next to a family with a crying baby. We waited for service several times, and were served by several different people.We chose the three course $95 menu. My entree was the best -- short ribs (required an up charge.). While not the best I have ever had, they were good. My husband and son both tried to order the turbo fish. It was surprising that at 6:30 , only one serving was left. The restaurant asked if they could substitute another fish and my husband agreed... Big mistake. His new fish had a rather strong taste. Husband and son proceeded to share their meals so each could enjoy some of the better fish.Upon return to the hotel, both became ill after a few hours. I did not get ill. We informed the restaurant just so they would know... Of course there is no definitive proof that the restaurant caused the illness, based on circumstantial evidence it appears to be the case. After a week of "investigation" the restaurant replied that they could find no issues relating to food safety.We have enjoyed many fine meals around the world. My advice: Have a great drink at Altitude-1 and don't worry about the cover charge. It is totally worth it for the 360 degree view of Singapore. Then dine somewhere else. There are plenty of fabulous restaurants in Singapore... Just not this one

Seems lots of great reviews about this restaurant but in that case we must be the bad luck one, we just find its really not worth of our time and money. We booked for the dinner at 6:30pm and after the waitress show us our nice window seat, we were left unattended for like 15 mins, no menu was given so we thought maybe we are too early, the restaurant was not ready. After about 20 min later I just can't wait anymore and ask for the menu and we got it, than we have to wait like another 15 min till we can wave down someone to take our order! To cut the long story short, service standard is extremely low, we ordered a glass of wine which never show up until we check again, than they realize that they forgotten about it, ask for warm water they give me plain cool water. The food are just ok as I find they are way too salty. I am sure I can have much better food and service at any restaurant nearby with the same view! Definitely will not come again!
4
Have been to this restaurant several times. Food is rated 4 stars, enough variety and not too expensive. Good ambience, good place for an informal lunch meeting , located at Raffles Place the hub of business. Advance booking is advisable.
4
The view, atmosphere and service as well as quality of food there were very nice. I am sure to return if I have a chance!
5
From A to Z, this place does it right! The scenery, ambiance, attention to detail, quality of service top shelf, cuisine appealing and excites the taste buds! Lot of flair and panache! A great night all around. Recommend to anyone!
5
The food was beautifully presented and tasted divine. The service was excellent. My server, Gwen, was superb.

There have been tons of reviews for Stellar, so i'll cut to the chase.This is a wonderful place if you are looking for a great view of the Singapore skyline, and/ or to even head up after to the 1-Altitude bar. Suitable for business lunches or dinner.Service is always prompt, but the quality of food received versus the cost was a big let down. With so many new age restaurants coming up around Singapore, Stellar is facing steep competition in today's new age gastronomy scene.Don't get me wrong, the chef and team pay alot of attention to detail and plating but you'd expect so much more in today's context. But hey to each their own. :
4
We were here on a business dinner, it is on the top floor of the Raffles Hotel, the restaurant is one of the best in Singapore. the teamhandling our service were very attentive to our needs and ensuring that we were attended to at all times. the mushroom soup was the best i have tried so far, the fish was grilled to the way i had requested for, the food was presented very artistically, the dessert platter was done well too but the taste was a bit below my expectation. overall an amazing place and the 360 view from the upper deck is super
4
Was early for our lunch so we able to get a nice table by the window. Perfect view of Raffles & Marina Bay area from such a high floor. Service was good but the foods was average to my liking. Hope they can improve on that
5
I was doing an incentive group at stellar . Wonderful view is the main we had this place , the team in 01 altitude are amazing they are friendly , professional ,not forgetting the chef of his creativity which was magnificent and last but not least food was awesome

Upon arrival receptionist was on the phone so my daughter went to press for the lift. 11.50 for 12 noon lunch. Receptionist told my daughter she needed to check that we had reservations. She checked, said OK then made us wait some more without telling us why. Only when I asked did she tell us she was checking to see if restaurant was ready. We were just 10 mins early. The manager shows up halfway into our wait & chats with the receptionist without disclosing who she was. She enters the lift with us. I tell my daughter I was going to complain abt the receptionist. The manager still incognito, defends her receptionist. Totally unprofessional behavior. Upon arrival the girl who seated us claimed to be the manager. I voiced my complaint & she apologised. While having lunch, we noticed that the big sized lady was actually the manager. (Confirmed by our server). These events spoilt what was to be a nice happy lunch with a view with my kids home for the holidays. Aghast at the unprofessional conduct of the manager. Diners made to feel wronged. Food quality has also declined or maybe everything tasted lousy after the lousy treatment by manager. Our server was very good & tried to make up for the manager. Will probably not go again despite the great view

Took my wife for her birthday dinner on 9 July 2016. I've been to the 1-Altitude roof top bar several times in the past and enjoyed it. This was my first time at Stellar. Expected it to be super posh and formal but was pleasantly surprised that it was more laid back. Great Japanese-inspired European cuisine. Good service. Liked how the dessert was created on our table itself. Good place to bring the family (with kids). Not stuck up place and the kids can be themselves. Quiet enough for conversation too. Tables are far apart enough. And of course the view
4
Very nice view. Drinks are $10 on Wednesday for ladies and the entry was free too. Their apple martini was great but they water them down. Good location too.
3
i remembered the dessert was kinda cool. Its like choc dome and the waitress lighted fire on it. food was average, so basically you are paying for the spectacular view.
5
if you are not on a budget and want to shine in the eyes of your better half!
you have to come here.
it is a place for us all to enjoy the height, the view, the GREAT food!!!
5
The lunch was magnificent, the view excellent. The service was very good.
Jackleh was our waitress and her service was excellent.
5
Nice ambience with great service staffs. Food looks great and taste good. Nice place to enjoy a meal with loved ones
4
Dinning with a view. Come and check the restaurant out for a perfect experience on your own or with friends.
3
Highly overpriced for quality of the food. The staff was very nice, diligent and elegant. The view does not make everything so If you pay excessive amount of money the expectations are higher. The ambience was elegant but too plain and not much of atmosphere. Food was quite good but not worth the money and did not amaze me
5
From the moment we arrived service was impeccable from our own personal waiter Eddie We chose the three course meal And even before the first course arrived we were given some amuse-bouche to taste - The food was absolute divine and each selection was beautifully described by Eddie. I would thorough recommend going to Stellar not just for the food but also for the view of the Marina Bay Sands area.
5
Firstly , an apology for the lateness of this review . My husband suffered an accident whilst we were in Vietnam ( following our stay in Singapore ) & that & other circumstances have meant reviews are very belated ! A great place to celebrate a birthday.Fantastic views from the 62nd floor & we were lucky enough to get a great window table.The staff were professional, friendly & attentive.The menu offered a choice of a 6,7 or 8 course degustation menu - 2 courses of which had to be appetisers & the rest mains &/or desserts so a good varied choice,We commenced with a lovely mixed Amuse Bouche of mini appetisers . The food was beautifully plated & everything was extremely tasty & well balanced in flavour.Our particular highlight was the dessert platter artistically done in front of you by the lovely chef- what she did looked very easy but realistically it would have been hard to achieve .A fantastic place to dine especially for a special occasion
5
My husband brought me to 1-Altitude for my birthday dinner. We have been to several fine dining restaurants before and this is by-far is one of the most memorable for us. We cannot fault anything. Our host Sasha was wonderful and always attentive. The taste of the food never failed to give us a little surprised the moment we bite into it. There was another private birthday dinner bash in the same restaurant which was held in the private room. Noise was not so heard from the main restaurant which was wonderful. I am still awed by my dinning experience and will surely be back
1
Feels like a con. Service was too slow. Except for the check. That came in a nano second.
Save your time (a lot of it) and stay away.
This is not gourmet but charges as if it is.
4
Good for Dates and good food options
International food is available
Usually gives you a party and fun experience with lots of people over the weekends
4
Great food and view, friendly and attentive staff, worth the price. Will go again next time. Highly recommended
5
62 floors up takes you to this amazing restaurant. Small and very personal. If you want to impress someone this is the place to go. The host I will say not waiter Eddie was fantastic , not only did he make sure all our needs were met but also made us feel special (along with the other guests). The food was superb. The setting was a delight. To top it off Eddie then took us to the bar on the top floor and the 360deg. view of Singapore was a treat.The evening topped off what was a memorable trip
4
Went there for lunch and opted for the 4-course set lunch. The scallop appetizer was not to my liking as the scallops were too soft and not firm. The clear soup was also ordinary. The salmon was good and so was the flat white. Would have preferred the tiramisu as a piece of cake instead of in a cup. Not much variety in the dessert selection. There wasn't any fruits
5
Went here for dinner last night as two couples. Service was totally amazing thanks to Eddie who made our visit so special by moving us to a table by the window, taking our photograph and then bringing us two framed prints and also providing his knowledge of the menu and wine list. Dinner was exceptional. We all thoroughly enjoyed it and also the lovely cocktail bar a floor above after dinner. Best night ever! Thanks Eddie xxx

This is my 2nd visit after a great experience during my first visit. However, this time I am a bit upset. When I checked with the restaurant previously, they said window seats are 1st come 1st serve. When I arrived, there are 2 window seats. When I requested for it. They said it's reserved but will check. But they never get back. I repeated my request. Same thing. It is so embarrassing for me as I am with my business associate
5
my second visit to this place. it offers awesome views of the marina, the city... from large windows. service is great. food is good. ambience is very nice.do get a table next to the windows.and you can also access the rooftop bar, which offers a 360 degree view from the height of about the 65th floor. lovely.and the people there are AWESOME. i forgot some papers on my table. when I recalled, i called the restaurant, but they were not able to find them. they were important papers, so I went back to the restaurant. they had shut and were cleaning up. they reiterated that they had searched but did not find any papers.probably they had been trashed. when I explained the importance, they actually put on gloves, and went through a very large trash can and located the papers somewhere close to the bottom of the trash can ! I mean, can you believe that ! How many people would do that?Absolutely awesome - and hats off to them 
5
We dined here with an old friend who had made the reservation. Firstly- there is no children's menu although they are happy to make up a couple of dishes to suit a child. If you have a fussy or basic eater this is not the place for you!!We chose the basic 3 course menu ( there are only set menus of varying levels) and I was worried that even this might be too much food for us as we are not huge eaters. The service, food and presentation were outstanding and our host Eddie was brilliant with his hospitality and recommendations.Between us we covered quite a bit of the menu but I don't think it would matter what you chose - it was all fabulous and the insertion of some key aperitifs was wonderful We would definitely recommend to eat here when you visit Singapore
5
Brought my wife for a lovely birthday lunch. Not only did we get the best seat in the house with the best view, the wonderful meal was topped up with a pleasant surprise of a personalized birthday cake and a sweet birthday song from Nicole and Sasha who provided excellent service. Special thanks to Nicole whose first-class service perfected the celebration. Definitely our best celebration venue so far!Dickson & Alliso
4
Servers were knowledgeable and polite. Pity about the not so clean / nice toilets. Also not pleasant to see staff eating ready to leave even as guests are in their dessert
4
Excellent location if you love city view from top. Good location. Very popular because it is at Singapore's highest top rise building. Good food drink and service.
Only drawback is sometimes you wont get place because of crowd.
Visited with family and friends. Nice experience.
5
Beautiful view of Singapore and amazing dishes.Kind staff, highly recommend! Thank you for everything we will come again!
5
Enjoy the dinner with family ! Great service by Eddie! Great view of Singapore
Long queue to get up to restaurants ..................................
4
Cheap for a french fine-dining scale - french fine dining would be double this price. Dishes are well-thought-out, and taste fine - quality-wise have to say this is not the best place you can go to. But the view adds some credit.
5
Been an awesome experience :) Thank u Eddie , Khai and Angela ❤️for making us feel so comfortable and the whole dining experience so enjoyable! Will come back again for all of your service.
5
Took wife, parents and our son to a 'Mother's day dinner' at this place. - To put is simply... We were blown away by the food, the view and also the natural attention of the staff. Eddie, the main attendant, was one of a kind. Cheerful, witty and also very helpful. - The view was 'first class', we are still dreaming of the tender Wagyu.. And I was told the 'ice cream' was beyond words. - Clearly a place to remember and visit again
5
The food is excellent - there's really something going on with those dishes, service was superb, and the view is amazing. The one who assisted us was Gwen and she's fantastic and has done a great customer service. True to its name, 'Stellar' has such a brilliant food and service
5
I was really impressed after having lunch at Stellar. They offer a great lunch special (3 courses for $50) which represents excellent value for money when you consider the quality of the food, the fit out of the dining room with the stunning view, and the professional and attentive service. The Roast Kuhlbarra barramundi was exceptional. Try the charcoal bread as well! The dining room is spacious - but book in advance so you can secure a prime window table
5
Great place which continues to change with the times, menu is superb supported by an excellent wine selection (at not unreasonable prices). This place is made all the better by the fantastic staff, our two waiters were the some ofd the best I have had the pleasure to meet with in Singapore, Khai and his colleague were great fun and made the night all the better for the five of us, we all thoroughly enjoyed the night. Highly recommended
5
The food was awesome and excellent presentation. Eddie served us and got us a window seat although we had not made a request for a window seat at the time of making the reservation. He was the best!
5
Eddie our waiter was great, he carried on small conversations with us and sat us next to the window for the laser light show on Marina Bay. Best place to have a romantic dinner, the food was fabulous and filling.
4
Gd lunch and service.
Good ambience, open concept kitchen, food is good and flexible to requests. Will come again.
5
They serve really nice food and delicious dessert, it's a good place for a romantic dinner or a business meeting.
5
once again, stunning have eaten twice here and can very mush reccomend it for parties of 4 - 6 in fine dining cusing
5
It was so delicious!! mmm...my friends can't stop talking about this place. We will come back for sure! It was delicious and service was wonderful!

I went here with 2 friends as a goodbye dinner prior to leaving Singapore. All in all I have to say that I was severely disappointed by Stellar, but it does have some positives.View:First and foremost the view: The view is spectacular. However, it can also be achieved by simply visiting the outdoor rooftop bar.Food:Amuse-bouche: Unidentifiable charcoal cracker - could have been good but was apparently prepared several hours in advance which means that by the time we got it, it had gone soggy and tasteless.Starter: We all had Foie Gras for starters which was very niceMain:The biggest disappointment was the main - without any form of warning or apology, the ordered beef cheek was replaced by beef brisket. The meat quality was below sub-par and tasted as if it came out of a cheap stew.Dessert:Although the presentation of the dessert was a bit questionable, its taste was excellent and by far the best part of the meal. Service:The biggest let down of the night, after the swapped main, was the service. While some of the waiters were attentive, most were unfriendly and seemingly tried to avoid any dialogue with us as much as possible
5
So there are a few high storey restaurants with good views of which this is one. When making the reservation, make sure you ask for the window seat. That is essential! Food was really good. We had a special set menu and the food was good. Started off with oysters with different flavours - didn't taste like oysters - very good. The scallops had the purée which was a very nice juxtaposition. The list goes one. May have similar food elsewhere but this place was competently executed with a little twist. Highlight was the desert. The fireball which was set afire on the table was a nice theatric flair. I really like the vanilla pudding with passion fruit. Service was excellent.
5
I would say the staff gave us very detailed introduction of each dish, and the taste of every dish was perfect and special. Was able to go up to 1-Altitude after the meal, but found it slightly too crowded for my liking. It was a birthday celebration for my husband, and I must say it's perfect
5
wow, if you want a restaurant with a view this is it and with fine dining alongside it was a winner all the way. We did not have a booking, but had been at Altitude, and on the way down stopped and asked if there was any tables. There was, but unfortunately not at the window but shortly after our main course we were asked if we would wish to move to a window seat and the views were just superb. We were well looked after by the maitre d'. A great all round experience in excellent facilities with great food
5
Service was top notch by the manager Gab, food was great too! :) we went here for the vday dinner, and every meal was a bomb.
5
It was our first time to had a nice dinner at Stellar at 1-altitude, and it was truly amazing..from the staff, food, service,ambience.. From the moment I saw the restaurant I was truly amazed,very classy.. The service was excellent, it was Laury and Gabbriel who attended us during our dinner,each food they're serving was well explained.. They are so friendly and approachable.. Good job! Foods were so perfect! We loved it a lot! Fantastic! We will definitely come back to this awesome restaurant!
4
Went there n got window seating. The view was magnificent! Went there with friends n took set lunch menu. Took clam pesto veloutÃ© which was ok then seafood risotto which was too salty. Thank goodness there's a spread of delicious desserts that we could take to our heart's delight: Apple crumble was excellent, salted malt tartlet was very tasty, mango pannacota was great n light, creme caramel was very smooth to the palate
5
My family and I had an incredible time -- Stellar has wonderful service, and really made my 21st birthday feel special. We were served by Gavin, who was delightful to speak with and added to our overall experience. The food was impeccable, and with a fantastic view to match, we just had a lovely evening. Their Fireball dessert is something you cannot leave without trying! Stellar truly lives up to its name
5
After my last vusit this restaurant is my favourite. We had birthday dinner there, 5 of us. I was surprised how the restaurant improved in everything -the service was posh &luxury, dishes -very beautiful and delicious. We had there grass fed tenderloin, Victorian lamb, truffle soup, scallops, oysters, white wine. Call for reservations, ask for window table. Good for romantic dinner
4
At 62 story high, you will be able to enjoy the your dinner over the skyline of Singapore that you almost forgot how much the dinner cost. Went to celebrate my wife's birthday dinner at one of the best fine dining restaurant certainly made her felt so happy as the ambience and food was excellent and creatively presented. Our main server, Gwen was the best server we ever been served. She knows the dishes well and kept a smiling face throughout our dinner. She even initiate to take pictures for us twice on different lighting scenarios. We definitely will visit Stellar again for our next big occasion
4
Came across Stellar while we were finding out where Indochine had moved to from the last time we were in Singapore. That restaurant has moved to Gardens by the bay - the recent reviews highlighted poor service so along comes Stellar and Altitude - how providential!Stellar is on the 62nd floor - check the photo out for thee view. Be warned that you must be dressed smart casual and definitely no shorts or flipflops (thank the lord).We went for the set lunch menu - 3 courses at $48 pp and 4 courses at $58 pp (wine not included). However, there are extra $s for some of the food e.g. bread, the cheese plate, the foie gras.The wait staff were excellent from the beginning; attentive and helpful with explanations of the served dishes - thank you Gwen. And the Chef Christopher Millar was cooking and supervising.We went for the three course options with one choosing the cheese and the other dessert. We also had the 'black' charcoal bread. and two amuse bouche - one finely shred/mouse of salmon and the other was served on a bellini topped with rowe.Entres: Foie gras terrine, duck proscuitto and fresh and dried/marmalade figs - this was terrific. Tiger prawn rocket, pecorino and pear - the prawns did not ooze 'fresh' (and this was one of the only disappointments with the whole meal). Both were beautifully presented.Mains: Lemon risotto served with seafood including a Japanese style baby octopus, scallops and a grilled tiger prawn & Veal served with sage polenta, zucchini bites and small pieces of carrot. These were both beautiful in flavour and texture. The risotto was perfect and the stock it was cooked in gave it fulsome flavour. Veal was just a tad rare which brought out the succulent meaty flaovour of the young animal.Four cheeses were served including a brie and a blue (both French) along with muscatels, pear, marmalade and crackers (thick sliced bread also but this was way too much). The Dessert Bar had a variety of small pastries, tiramisu, waffles, panna cotta and fresh fruit.Obviously, one goes to a restaurant to enjoy the food. On this occasion the view was pretty spectacular!Well done to the Aussie Executive Chef
4
We had a voucher to dine at Stellar@1-Altitude, and the set lunch was simply amazing. Appetisers and mains were all served hot and fresh, and the dessert bar was incredible as well. This was my second time dining at Stellar during lunch, and the food once again was amazing.Definitely a thumbs up for the great service by Khairul as well, who showed us up to the Viewing Gallery as well. Thanks for the great time Stellar @ 1-Altitude! We'll definitely be back
4
The staff were attentive to us from the moment we stepped in. We were given the window table which provided us with a spectacular view of the Marina Bay Sands area. We had the 6 course Constellation menu that lasted for 4 hours as we took our time to indulge and savour the courses. Each dish presented was meticulously explained by the staff and recommendations on the order of consuming the food. We love the overall presentation especially the dessert art, which concluded the entire dining experience beautifully
3
Attentive service, excellent amuse-bouches and starters. Main courses however were an utter disappointment, over cooked and under seasoned - plain bland and using cuts of seabass which ordinarily a fine chef wouldn't use as a standalone fillet! A real shame as the presentation was excellent. Perfect cheeses and a very good wine selection. Come early to safeguard a table by the window which is a must - hence the stunning views. Ladies toilet was a mess however. So some attention to detail needed here
4
Worth putting in your dining diary for great views and good food. Come with a date or friends. Tastes best when someone else pays!
5
Visited after a friend recommended. Fantastic evening, beautiful views, food sensational, cocktails a must....Overall a great night for myself and husband.
5
It was worth every cent. The service was absolutely great, with much attention paid to every guest. They helped to decorate our dessert with birthday greetings and the food had very intricately put together taste. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.
5
Restaurants ambiance is great and servic is good. Glad with their service and dessert. Will go back again.
4
This restaurant seats on one of the tallest office building in singapore. The view is breath taking. Ala care menu is fairly pricy but the set lunch is of pretty good value. They served fusion food.
5
You will be pleased by the excellent selection of wonderful food, great service, and outstanding wines. Make your reservations early and ask for a window table if possible. This place is not cheap, but prices are appropriate for the food and service.
5
We were served by Gwen on Feb 2016. She was patient, attentive and awesome. She explained each dish to us and helped us to check whether we could do a swap with the dishes. I left a bottle of bird's nest in the restaurant without realising it and she came to find me at the rooftop bar just to hand me back my bird's nest. Was really touched with her excellent service.We chose a 6 course meal and the price is definitely worth it for the food, ambience and also service. As it was my hubby's birthday, they helped to decorate our desserts with birthday greetings and also sang a birthday song to my hubby. We chose a fireball for our dessert and the chef came out to do a demonstration for us. Gwen took a picture for my hubby and I and she developed the picture for us, without us knowing, thus we were caught by surprise.Overall, we had a very good experience. The view was awesome too as we managed to catch a 360 degree view of Singapore at the rooftop bar (free access for diners)
4
We like Stellar mostly for the complmentary entry (which they extend to all diners) to the club located at the roof top . The views from the rooftop is fantastic and the party atmosphere is a the perfect ending to a lovely evening spent at Stellar.Service was attentive and fast. There was nothing to complain about.The food was good though not extraordinarily outstanding. We were happy with our orders and the portions were just right for us
5
Gavin was awesome, enjoyed the whole experience. The food was outstanding including the presentation. Best steak in Singapore. Will go back many times. Afterwards we went to the Altitude on the 63rd floor, you do NOT want to skip this experience, the view was breathtaking. This IS the Number 1 place in Singapore. Don't miss out, go see for yourself. Thank you Gavin and at Altitude Raymond for making this the most wonderful experience ever
4
I was served by Khairul, December 2015. The food was good (tho not fantastic) but it was made up by the good city view as well as the patient and kind service! I would not say I would visit here for a normal dinner, but I would if there would still be any special occasions. My boyfriend made reservation for our anniversary dinner and I enjoyed it very much :) overall experience was good. The price range expected would be $200-300. We had an appetizer, main course and dessert for two pax for that price :)
4
The food wasn't the best but still good. The scenery of window seat was the highlight, great views from sunset to night. Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday and definitely will return on a special occasion!
5
Had the opportunity to have dinner at Stellar and throughly enjoyed it. The food, view and service were great making it a very enjoyable evening.

Bf brought me there for our anniversary dinner, and got us a window seat, with the view of Singapore from the top. The view comes with a price tag as the dinner menu starts at 95++ per pax for 3 course meal, with some top up surcharge for more expensive good ingredients like scallop or kobe beef. We upgraded and ordered Scallop and Kobe beef steak and ordered some Moscato as well. Our total bills came at around $320 for 2. Food quality is average. My kobe steak tasted average at best, while my bf's steak was a little burnt and tasted quite bitter. The scallop appetizers are nice but what could go wrong with scallop. Dessert was not too bad, in general they were quite delicious (Macaron are nice, and chocolate ganache ) but one of the new dessert item ( snowball something) is super tangy, and we didnt like it. Service staff are very attentive but I felt that they were constantly looking at us. I felt the lack of privacy. Service are good in general. Ambience wise, the view is nice but they were having some kind of Xmas party next door. (We were only separated by a thin wall divider.) The noise of loud music, guests and emcee really just destroy the supposedly relaxing and romantic ambience. Overall, I dont think It is value for money as it is too expensive to dine here, especially when you are looking for a romantic dinner to spent with your loved one, or if you want good food. We felt like we are just paying for the view

Its not cheap; but dont expect anything in Singapore to be cheap! If you want that go to a Hawker Centre. So, pricey for the food but the food and service was excellent. I expected it to be pricey. Its 1 floor below the 1-Altitude alfresco bar (highest alfesco bar in world I believe) and you get entry to that for free in the evenings
2
Food quality/price is bad. a "Ma-tu-vue" place. a place where materialism is symptomatic for poverty.

We celebrated a friend's birthday as a group and had a really amazing time. There were 10 of us and making arrangements for such a big group is not easy due to the different diet requirements of each individual but we were not given a hard time over this and suitable replacements were suggested. Of course we had asked in advance, and am happy that the restaurant accommodated us. Even then, we discovered one of the dishes had a pork element during service, which one guest couldn't take, and the restaurant immediately removed and replaced it. Service was up there along with the view. The best part was the dessert chef coming in to individually plate the desserts and explain each process. We felt pampered and everyone enjoyed the fine dining experience
4
Really nice meal at the end of our SE Asia holiday. Had tried to get into Cliff at Sentosa but was closed, and concierge recommended this as an alternative. View was excellent (though make sure you also check out the bar upstairs where you get an all round view without glass) Service was efficient and friendly. Only people was the air on which was super cold!! My wife immediately wore two scarves and this was not enough. I came without a jacket but in long trousers/socks/shoes and was shivering. A real shame which brings this review down a star
5
We went for the christmas eve dinner menu which was about $130++ each person. There was a five course meal with additional surprise in the end after dessert. We were full and thoroughly satisfied with the explosion of so many different flavours, very scrumptious and gastronomic food. There was also a live station where we got a little bit of everything to try like turkey, ham and sea bass with complimentary sauces. We also had the surprise christmas cake at the end after dessert, served on a tree branch very pleasant and tasty. Our desserts had came in with a royal entrance, with dry ice smoke effects and served to us by a chef very impressive. The chef also graciously threw in some details apart from elegantly serving us and i must say we thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream! All the staff were so wonderful, accomodative, jovial and their service was excellent, gold class! Will definitely go back again, sorry just cant stop before i end i would quickly like to add that the view is breathtaking and the staff also took a picture of us and gave it to us later for frÃ¨e we were very touched. A big shout out to all the staff and Mr. Khairul serving us at Stellar on 24th Dec 2015 thank you so much! You made our day, undeniably once in a lifetime experience
4
Great place to dine. Will recommend anyone to be seated starting from 6pm to enjoy the breathtaking view of Singapore's CBD area and iconic architectures (i.e. MBS). Was served by Khairul which was very attentive and polite. Food wise very good except for the bad oysters that I received; but nevertheless was replaced without any hesitations
5
Fantastic 10th anniversary at Stellar at level 62 here in Singapore at One Raffles. The food was amazing, the staff was incredible the view fantastic....what more could you ask for on the 10th anniversary:) Many fine dinning restuarants shy away from children....those one total embracement and made that experience amazing:
5
I was really impressed by the service! The food was mind-blowing awesome, and I absolutely loved the view of the city. Great choice of restaurant if you love fine dining and enjoy a good view.
3
Possibly the best view islandwide, although you'd be better off visiting the nightclub upstairs and grabbing a drink rather than dine here. Prefer Sky on 57 at MBS across the bay for dining with a view.
2
They don't speak well and the wine glasses are put far end across the table than for the intended. Kind of expensive for the food one gets
4
really like the food there and the ambiance. price was nominal, however the hospitality was appreciable.

Last night we enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Stellar. A party of six we were welcomed by very friendly staff who suggested we enjoyed our welcome drink at the sky bar. Of course the views are stunning from the highest building in Singapore but the overall ambiance makes it even more spectacular: background music, cool crowd and good service although the waiting time for drinks is considerable. One floor down at the restaurant our table decided to go for the Winter menu. While my wife choose the cauliflower tagine I picked the soufflé of Gruyere. Both dishes were great in taste, size and presentation. As mains we both had the French chicken which was served with potato purée, a cream of peas, baked hazelnuts and lovely herbs. Excellent combination of flavors. The dessert was even better: the yoghurt creme brûlée was tender served with fresh fruits and coffee crumble. One of the best desserts we have ever had. After dinner a nightcap in the rooftop bar to 'top' off a perfect evening. Although washrooms could be a bit better taken care of, we are still wondering why this restaurant does not have a star yet. Of course the setting comes 'for free' but service is friendly with good timing and the quality of all dishes was outstanding. I have had quite a few dinners in this culinary city but last night's dinner at Stellar tops it all!
5
Came for birthday celebration, food was great, view was stunning, but the best experience came from our waiter khairul who was exceptionally professional and friendly throughout the night. We had dietary restrictions and he was quick to recommend and advice on the dishes we could pick. The day ended with us getting a photo for sovenier, dishes on the house and a wonderful experience. It was our first time here and we would likely return agai

I had visited this restaurant four times in 2015 because it was convenient for most of my clients for business discussion. I don't personally like the food despite they change their menu occasionally. Nothing served during my visits had given me the "wow" effect that it was good. It is a restaurant catering mostly to business luncheons and tables are reasonably apart and good for business discussions without being eavesdropped. Service is good but the staff are not adequately trained. A few don't even speak proper English and when asked about the soup of the day, had to be excused to check. Hmmm....this is the basic I thought Will I return? No, unless requested by clients.

I organized a corporate dinner at this restaurant for 120 persons and it was the worst dinner ever since 17 years!!! The food was tasteless and the service just incredibly bad!!! On top of this, the price was incredible high for what they served us.Only 1 glass for the red and white wines on the table. The staff left the same cutlery on the tables for two courses, the food was more or less cold, ecc...We had the aperitif on the terrace and we paid an amazing price for the venue rental. When I arrived two hours before our guests, I discovered that they wanted to serve us in plastic glasses that were used already many times. Totally scrashed and not even transparent!!! The Venus manager told me that this was not a problem as it will not be visible when the glasses will be filled during the night!!! The terrace furnitures were totally destroyed and some dangerous open electric cables were visible on the floor...I can only recommend you to avoid this place and to run away!!
4
If you get to secure a table by the window, you enjoy probably the best view on Singapore. Food is a bit pretentious : classic despite efforts, internationnal dishes well executed and good but no magic twist. Price is corrolated to the rental price of the place i guess... But i recommend anyway to go from times to times, it s a solid adress
5
All I can say is WOW! Great Service by Julian & Jackleh - 10 gold stars on their service rendered! Elegant setting with lovely view. The festive menu, food presentation & desserts served was amazing; EVERYTHING was delicious. Goat cheese & leek was a real winner for me (YUM). Simply put, Stellar went above and beyond our expectations in making sure that everyone had a good time
5
Fantastic view and good food. Special turkey and dessert station set the mood for Christmas. Special mention to Gabriel who provided excellent, fun and attention-to-detail service. Gabriel's service tops up a good and memorable meal!
5
We went there to celebrate our anniversary. The meal was fantastic made all the better by the cheerful waitress and generous views of Singapore.
5
food was excellent, setting was great, fabulous view, service could have been a bit more attentive for what we were paying, but still a big thumbs up. :)
3
I loved what I ate however I left the restaurant half hungry. The portions are artistically presented but... boy they are so small. 20 minutes of waiting then 1 minute to disappear into the stomach. I am glad this was a corporate affair.
4
The venison loin tastes nice and the price is affordable too. Went there 2 months ago and will definitely visit it again.
5
We had our anniversary meal here and it was a perfect evening. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, the staff were genuinely friendly and attentive. Expensive but great value for the money. Highly recommend for that special evening.
3
On arrival to the reception, we were whisked up to the second highest floor where the restaurant was located. The view was from restaurant was expansive and clear thanks to the full length windows all around.We ordered from the set lunch menu. The food was in my opinion just slightly above average. After lunch we took the opportunity to head up to the roof top to have a panoramic view of Singapore, which turned out to be the key event in our trip to this restaurant.I would say that the ambiance and view is what is most attractive about this establishment.If you plan to have lunch here on weekdays, do bear in mind that you may be inconvenienced at the lift lobby and have to wait when produce and alcohol delivery is delivered
2
1. "Study" the menu carefully and ask for clarification if required. Menu is very complex, especially items with "2 pax" for sharing and items required supplement payment. With much guidance from the staff and after many rounds of clarification, we ordered meat platter which says $10 supplement per pax that allows you to choose 3 types of meat. We were misinformed and ended up with a big hole in our pockets!!2. Menu is very limited for people with allergy to prawns, crabs and lobsters (crustaceans)
4
We were in Singapore for a conference. What a treat to be taken to this restaurant. I am sure there is lovely food in many restaurants, but not many would have a location such as this that a visitor can enjoy with amazing views. Be sure to go up to the bar to check out the view from there as well
4
Hosted a friend from overseas who was here briefly for a business trip. Wanted a place special, hence, came here for dinner and drinks. We had the dinner combi or something along that line whereby you can choose a few items from different categories. Price was considered a bit steep if you are not in the high earner tier, but if for an experience on special occasion, it's worth a try. There were some surprises to our palate in some dishes, such as one (which unfortunately, I can't remember the name) which kind of have tingling "bursts" in your mouth. The portion came pretty small like sampling sizes and big eaters may not feel full after the meal. We had a tight schedule and left without desserts, I heard their desserts are pretty impressive though. Only recommended if you have the cash to spare for a special evening or if you are ultra rich and want to impress a girl. ;
5
This is the Real Room at the TOP. Great place to wind up, have fun, relax, appreciate Engineering, design, Architecture, Social Sciences harmoniously infused together. Just the mere thought of the higher you go the cooler it becomes. Chilling is fun.
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday with dinner here. Prices were on the high side but the food was worth it.
Recommend the truffle risotto and among many others
3
I went together with my friend a month ago . The night scene is beautiful and a view of singapore sky lines. Food is alright but the experience is awesome. However the quality and service isn't as good as before...
4
Great food, great ambience and personalised service. Thumbs up! I will definitely be back to in the near future!
5
Just enjoy a great view right above this bar, If its raining sit back at stellar and enjoy the food and drinks
5
I went to Stella for lunch with my wife, and it was a perfect experience! We reserved a table for Restaurant week and ordered the the set menu only costs SGD 40.00++ for each for a 3 courses lunch set. I strongly recommend the first item of each course: Foie Gras and beef. The service was also very good with beautiful view from 62 storey
5
Had two experience at this venue. 1st was in Oct 2014, love their quality food. The lobster risotto I had was phenomenal. The bisque was great too. Love their fresh sashimi and succulent oysters. Amazing food with amazing service!2nd was in Dec 2014, friend's wedding which I helped oversee. The staff assigned to run the wedding event were professionals. They accommodated to the couple's requests and were very prompt in answering queries and fixing issues. The food that night was spectacular too and the standard was similar to my first experience. I highly recommend this place despite their fine dining prices for a romantic dining experience with quality service
5
We had dinner with a group of 100 people and everything was absolutely perfect. Great food, good service, and of course a great apero on the fantastic terrasse overlooking Singapore. I had been many times in Singapore before, including at the Marina Bay Sands on the terrasse, but the 1-altitude terrasse plays in another league! The cocktails are great to. Really worth the experience
4
This restaurant has one of the best view ever. Food was a little expensive but dining here could get u a free admission up to d world's highest bar. Be sure to go when the weather is good else the bar would be closed to the public if there's lightning/rain
4
I went for lunch with some of my colleagues, to celebrate the last day of work of one of us. Hence we were looking for something special and not ordinary: we found it!Besides the obvious breathtaking view on the top of Singapore, where out table was located, the food was a delight, presented in a spectacular manner on the table and plate. I'm a "sweets lover" hence the one part I liked the most was the desserts buffet. Cons1. The waitress tried to stop me twice from going to the desserts buffet area - every time I would walk towards it, she would not so kindly inform me I could only eat it after the main course. In my head I was thinking my mum was the last to tell me such thing, around 15 years ago. This is something none of us at the table appreciated, and I did not hesitate to make that clear. In fact, I eventually ate desserts before the main even arrived, even though the waitresses kept looking at me with disappointment. We were paying too much to care. 2. Pricey - indeed you are paying for the view and on top of it, the nice food. However, we spent $120 each for lunch.
4
Reason for picking up this restaurant was the views that it was supposed to offer unfortunately we do not sit near the window. However it is highly recommend for dates because the ambiance is very private.
4
Service can be better especially when we ask for food recommandation....waiter did not make suggestion
3
An amazing venue for the view but the service and food lack the oomph to match the view.
It will be an appropriate for business luncheon but not more if you are looking for quality food as there are better food options in Singapore.
5
Best in class restaurant with Skyview :)
Great food & service.
Great music.
Best for couples & overseas honeymooners
4
Ala Carte is better than the set dinner. Love the Japanese and Western served in the restaurant. Mash Potato is superb! Nice ambiance too.
5
Great food great views over Singapore
Ambience is not great as you would expect it to be,
BUT the food is great the desserts are to die for
4
Excellent food quality, menu and presentation. Impeccable service coupled by scenic views of the Marina bay. Perfect for special occasions. Family friendly as well. Make sure to reserve a window seat for best views.
4
Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Service was generally warm and personalised throughout, although it got somewhat slow at the end when more people started streaming in.We reserved a window seat, so the view was really great and was probably the highlight of dinner. We ordered the meat platter where we tried their Wagyu and Kobe beef. The meat was well cooked, although it could have been rested a bit more, but it tasted delectable nonetheless. We also had the opportunity to try their fresh oysters, and they were the freshest that i had tasted in a while. Would recommend all to try them. We had the fireball and some mousse for dessert. The fireball was a visual treat and tasted delicious, although I found the taste to be a tad too alcoholic. The hazelnut mousse had a smooth texture to it. All in all, food quality was good, albeit somewhat pricey. But a small splurge for a special event with an awesome ambience is nevertheless manageable. The service and view were undoubtedly the highlight of our dinner
2
I had emailed to book this restaurant about 8 to 10 weeks before we wanted to dine. I was advised my reservation would be confirmed one month before, which it was. We arrived on the night to find that most of the restaurant area had been closed off for a private function, with only 4 tables left in the restaurant area. We had to put up with raucous laughter from behind the partition. Food was great, but not only absolutely no ambiance, couldn't hear each other talk, and noise from the function made it one of the most unpleasant dining experiences we have ever had. Spend your considerable money sonewhere that understands that a great dining experience is not just about the food
2
Without the view this restaurant would probably be completely and utterly empty. It is the usual disappointment these days with microscopic portions, barely any taste and inflated prices just because of the location. Depending on when you book you might not even get a table with a view in the first place. Highly disappointed and not worth the time or $$$ spent
2
Theatrical, but not particuarly delicious. Paid 80++ for a set menu and all I could have for dessert that was gluten free was the blancmange.
4
The food was decent, service was prompt and there is a good view of the Central Business District at night.
2
Great food but bad atmosphere. Restaurant should have informed me that a public event was being held in the restaurant at the time. My table was the first one off the elevator. It felt like a very last minute addition.
4
Stunning views, slick service and fine dining. Great place to go for a business lunch or even a very special romantic dinner.
3
The view is good.The service and the foods are just OK compare to the price.The atmosphere and the decoration is nice.The oysters are fresh and good.Pls try Fire ball,It's good ^^
4
wat a place to be in so much fun and to enjoy with friends family relatives and importantly will remember these memories.
4
Hubby took me here to celebrate my birthday and it was wonderful! The view was amazing, the service was great, the manager did a wonderful job of making us feel welcomed and relaxed, he also assisted us with our order and provided lots of tips into Singapore. We had the selection of meat platter (where they serve you different types of meats) and some breads to start off with. The meats were tasty, some more than others but a good dish. Dessert was amazing, we had the fireball and it was amazing watching them create the dessert in front of you!Worth going at least once for a special occasion
3
We were invited to an event taking place at Stellar 1 Altitude. The view was breath taking. We were in the enclosed glass function room - perfect for people afraid of heights. The drinks and finger food served were mediocre . The rate at which food was brought out to the huge number of standing guests was slow. Some people did not manage to get a bite. The elevators were limited . They were not able to cope when everyone decides to leave at the same time! Overal was lovely for a function or for special dat
3
I had high expectations of Stellar but the food was bland apart from the desserts, the service was good but the decor was also bland, views are great if you sit near the window but most people aren't. nothing special and wouldn't return, there are better places in the CBD for lunch
5
If you are gong to 1-Altitude for drinks and the view at the tallest bar in Singapore, make plans to have dinner just 1 floor below at Stellar. It's a fine dining place, so can be expensive but a superb place for that special occasion or just of you're feeling like spoiling yourself. It's mainly western international cuisine but there was also a sashimi Japanese counter...not sure of that was a permanent fixture or a promotion. Great choice of food and wines. I remember to was all good but can't recall any specific dishes except for one...an absolutely to-die-for Gruyere cheese souffle. Yes, a scuffle. It was the best thing ever, everyone at my table had a taste, and so tempted to order another one. Views are excellent, and of course, after dinner, go upstairs to 1-Altitude for good views, good music
5
We celebrated a friend's 50th here and it was very classy. We had a private room to our group. The food was wonderful, well presented and service was outstanding. But the views!! It was incredible. That alone is worth a special occasion.
5
Great ambience, good food and wine, prompt service and a fabulous view to boot. Recommend for work and fine dining with friends. Put on your best suit, place to see and be seen.
4
The food was great, especially the dessert.
Worth trying...at least once.
Suggest you check the rooftop for the views - good for cocktails or drinks after dinner.
4
View is great!! Food was acceptable for its price wasnt mind blowing though. Should just come here once just for the view. One tip, if you go to the roof top for drinks, do take note that drinks are extremely costly and not good at all! That was a total let down, other than that, the restaurant is ok, not fantastic, but views more than made up for it.
5
We visited Setter in Oct last year (2014). I have booked a private room but didn't realise you needed to have approx. 20 people to do so. At first we were told that we had to eat in the normal area, but once I spoke to the manager (Gabriel) and explained our mistake and that we really wanted the views of the city from the private dinning side, he agreed to let us eat in the private room.The service was outstanding and the food out of this world. We paid about $250 each but got what we paid for. Great views, great service and perfect food.A must visit if you are in Singapore
5
I went on Restaurant Week with my friends and the view here is magnificent. Food is done up nicely as well and for the value of Restaurant Week $55++ for dinner, it is definitely value for money. Highly recommend for dates because the ambience is very private and the view is great
5
We had the executive set menu which was reasonably priced. Food came in decent quantities and superb quality - so what else can we say! Even though the restaurant was packed with lunch time crowd, we were served efficiently and expeditiously by the wait staff. Loved the food - exquisite yet so simple. Would definitely come back for dinner.
4
The views from the window tables are outstanding (worth making a reservation for an early time as the window tables are often allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis). The food is minimalist but well prepared and represents good overall value. I have visited for lunch and can recommend it as a venue for value-for-money at lunch time (although the price range is towards the upper end). A night-time view coupled with what I experienced for food at lunch would (I'm sure) be an even bigger treat. In short, not a place you go every day but a great venue for the odd occasion nonetheless
5
I chose stellar because it was an impromptu, convenient decision for a romantic dinner opposite my husband's office. I didn't have a good experience at 1 altitude bar the last time so I didn't expect much from the restaurant. But the food and service took me by surprise! I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered a window seat when a guest cancelled their booking. It was a nice gesture because I did wanted a window seat but they were fully booked. The view was not spectacular but still nice. We managed to catch the laser show by MBS. The stellar menu and carte had so many choices. Try the "fire ball" dessert
4
Having heard of this charismatic dining place with its spectacular views, the Beau. We were given a window seat so that we could take in the panoramic views while we enjoyed the meal.For the first course of the set meal, we had the Scallops 'Carbonara' (SGD$28.00) - parmesan cheese, bacon ash, egg yolk, milk skin. The bouncy fresh scallosp was seared to a smokey sumptuousness, going very well with the creamy
5
I really had a great time dining in stellar. The crew are very accommodating. Kobe wagyu steak is a must try.
5
Perfect romantic venue! Celebrated birthday here. Good food, good view, good ambience. The staff are friendly with good service. They even addressed our name! :)
3
The food is normal western standard. The main attraction for this restaurant is the night view. Opt for table next to window and have a romantic dinner with partner. You can also go up to viewing gallery if weather is good. This is a restaurant with good night view of Singapore!
4
Really good all round. I came along with a gang of 50 - a business outing. And we had to chose our menu choices in advance - and I thought that this is not going to be great because getting 50 sets of varied choices to serve at one time is going to cause a strain and mean we get mediocre food and serviceSurprise - surprise. It was all great. I had the Hokkaido scallop, lobster bisque, fish and then fruits. All tasted very goo and my colleagues around me, who had different items, were all saying that their food was good.Great food - very fair service given our numbers - plus great views.Memorabl
3
Came here for lunch today with a colleague. The views are certainly impressive: it was kind of rainy today but could still see out past Marina Barrage and over all the nearby buildings in the CBD. Food is comparatively average. I had the crispy pork for starter and the salmon for main, both of which were good without being exceptional. The desserts were offered in the form of a small buffet style table and were disappointing: the fruit salad in particular just didn't have any taste (and in fact I've had better fruit salad from The Sandwich Shop). Overall it's ok at $44++ for lunch, but I don't think I'll be back
5
Been here twice. Had a six-courses meals during the Valentine's day - it was awesome set of cuisine. Very delicious with the compliment of the sunset view in the cloud. Had a normal entree dinner at other time which served a good cut of meat. Very nicely done. Finishing both dinners with drinks at the highest alfresco bar in the world. 360 degree unobstructed view of singapore city price wise; definitely wort
4
the tasting menu is a great option, the service was also surprisingly good, although we did have to insist on a window seat which they initially refused to release to us, even though the restaurant was half empty, and suggested they would move us mid-dinner!After the initial bumpy service, the rest of the evening was great, with fantastic views of the skyline, and Marina Bay sands...the tasting menu was good value for money, and quality of the food was great!We ordered a bottle of Malbec with dinner which was also very good!definitely worth a visit, but perhaps call to book to request a window seat, since that is half the reason of going there

Having heard of this charismatic dining place with its spectacular views, the Beau and I decided to celebrate our 9th year anniversary at Stellar @ One Altitude this year.We were given a window seat so that we could take in the panoramic views while we enjoyed the meal.For the first course of the set meal, we had the Scallops 'Carbonara' (SGD$28.00) - parmesan cheese, bacon ash, egg yolk, milk skin. The bouncy fresh scallosp was seared to a smokey sumptuousness, going very well with the creamy cheese broth surrounding it.The next course was the Caramelized Foie Gras (SGD$28.00) served with fragrant chicken broth, cepes, garlic cream and toast. The foie gras was lightly paired with the aromatic sweetness of caramel, penetrating well into the rich buttery texture of the slab of foie gras. The chicken broth was delicate but flavourful; giving a lovely bite with each mouthful of cepes.The fourth course was Yellow Fin Tuna (SGD$44.00), a generous chunk of wood fired yellow fin tuna with rissoni, broad beans, petit pois and mint, fromage blanc and picked cucumber. I loved the texture of this block of tuna, fired to an excellent texture between sashimi and smoked tuna. I also enjoyed the taste of this sweet fish, surrounded by saccharine vegetables.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/dinner-at-stellar-one-altitude.htm

So for our final night in Singapore we finally made it to 1-Altitude.After paying the Sgd30 per person cover charge we made it to the roof to claim our free drink which was actually pretty good, then we walked up the steps and the view of Singapore was Amazing!!!Unfortunately after that the service went down hill. They did find us a table without a reservation but do not have the first idea about good customer service. Instead of asking if we wanted to open a tab they tried to ask us to settle the first round in the middle of eating food, even though we wanted more drinks.The drinks menu and food menu were good and reasonably priced for Singapore
4
We went with Singaporean friends for a birthday and reunion and they had booked a window table at sunset. The experience of watching the harbor and surrounds change over the sunset period was incredibly beautiful. The light show at Marina Bay was great from this angle.But we did come to eat! The menu was impressive and the food good, but not, I suspect, worth the price. But you are buying the view! There was a great wine list, but at very high prices. Service was satisfactory but nothing to write home about.But after the meal, a trip to the roof top for a panoramic view of the entire city really provided an incredible finale for the meal
4
Working more than ten years in the Raffles Place, but it is my 1st visit to Stellar at 1-Altitude! Got to thank my boss for bringing me. The food and drinks were good, what really capture me, was the scenery! Beautiful, beautiful Singapore!
5
Everything was perfect...
The staff is friendly and skilled, the food was fantastic (7 course fixed menu) and we had a table at the window, so we could fully enjoy the sunset. Very much recommended for special occassions.
5
Loved the spectacular evening view of Singapore at this sky high bar. Entry was about AUS$30 but included a cocktail and once we sped quickly to the top the service was efficient and friendly.

We booked a dinner for about 15 people and had a dinner set to choose from. It’s a very modern “hip” restaurant with an active roof-top bar. The restaurant itself was quite noisy so don’t expect to have an easy conversation but it has a great view being 62 floors up. The appetiser assortment and bread basket was lovely and the entree (Sea Bass) was good. Although I’m not a big wine drinker, the group selected several and they were all quite good. The dessert platter however just didn’t have a good taste to them. 4 of us to each platter assortment and we all agreed 3 of the 4 desserts provided were not good, just something about the taste did not go down well.
2
This was a special occasion, a party of 6 friends being together again after many years celebrating a special birthday. The first thing we were told as we sat down was that we would have to vacate our table after 2 hours - something we certainly weren't told when making the reservation. The service was lack-lustre to say the least. We were constantly having to look for a waiter to pour more wine, replace cutlery, order water etc. The food was generally tasteless and cold by the time we got it. No-one came to ask if everything was ok, during the meal. When we ordered pudding, one of our party asked them to explain the types of cheese on the cheeseboard, the waitress said she didn't know, so we asked if there was someone who did. She went away and we could see her asking a colleague who was obviously looking it up on a mobile phone while our waitress frantically scribbled away before coming back to tell us. I suppose that was the only initiative shown by the staff all evening. The coffee (tepid) was served a good ten minutes before the pudding or cheese arrived. We did speak to the Manager before we left who admitted things hadn't been perfect and that they were having problems, however he offered no apology or even an acknowledgement and then simply cut the conversation short by turning away to talk to a colleague. Being charged $SGD200 a head and a $SGD200 service charge was a disgrace. Quite frankly a decent view does not make up for such a bad experience. I don't imagine for a minute the restaurant will read this review as they don't seem to be at all bothered about any of their customers

Here for a large group dinner and this was an excellent choice by our hosts. Stunning views across Singapore nad atad exciting if you are dining close to the windows - don't look down!Food was excellent and service attentive. Good seafood and steak. You do need to take advantage of the location to have direct access to the roof terrace and bar by elevator or stair. The hip place to be in Singapore and you do not need to queue or pay extra for the pelasure of joining the in-crowd! A good place to watch the light show over the harbour and great views of the city skyline

Simply my best dining experience of 2015 so far. Everything from the service, the food, the view is magnificent! Also the price is good in comparison with the general prices in singapore. A must do in Singapore! The wagyu beef is splendid and the tuna is just wonderful as well! As dessert we had the chocolate and the creme brulee. just a breath taking experience
5
The view is indeed breath taking. I went for lunch . Night view should be very romantic. we can say that Singapore also have the million dollar view.Food is nice and reasonable price ,consider you pay for the view and fine dining experience.After a meal at stellar, just take lift up to roof top to enjoy Blue sky and very Blue sea, all the way to Indo island , sentosa cove etc . You can see all the Famous Singapore icons from this building, Esplanade, Singapore River, Merlion, Boat Quay, Fullerton, Flyer, Helix bridge, floating platform, Marina Bay sands etc etc ...Go on a week day to avoid crowd. There are 2 views for window seat: The ocean(MBS) view or the inner view of Padang, singapore river etc both are excellen

We had an excellent dinner at Stellar recently, although it was mid-week so the restaurant was fairly quiet but this did mean we got to sit next to the window which gave us an excellent view over the Singapore towards Indonesia. We chose the 5 course tasting menu which was fantastic, the size of each dish was perfect. Standout dishes would have to be Quail and tiger prawn salad, Aglio Uni and the Chilean Sea Bass. Deserts were assembled at the table which added a sense of occasion to the while meal. The cocktails were limited to Martini’s however the wine list is extensive. Service was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. We decided to finish off our wine at the Altitude bar upstairs which has the best 360 views over Singapore and definitely worth a visit for the view if nothing else
5
There can't be too many restaurants in Singapore with that view. So for pure romance and occasion, you'd be hard pushed to beat a meal at Stellar. The food was very good on the whole, although there were a couple of disappointments; however between the two of us we had 14 dishes - we were never going to like them all. Highlights were the scallop 'carbonara', the sea bass and the desserts prepared / served by the chef at your table. There is actually a very good value meal to be had here if you order sensibly. Whilst you may like to go for the blow out and have 7 courses each, you can also get a good value 2 or 3 course dinner, given the location.

Had a lovely dinner at Stellar. Took the earlier seating to see the sunset while having dinner by a window table. The view was awesome and the food was great too! Definitely will revisit for special occasions again.

As per my tittle is a great bar, fantastic view but if you are a solo female traveller maybe you'll feel a little uncomfortable, but if you find mind people looking at you a bit funny, then you'll be ok
5
Great views obviously but great food to go with it.
Each dish was superb- well presented, the right portion and of course delicious.
Very good well informed service and the personal touch.
Made a special day even more special.

if you would like to pay for spectacular views, drop by this place, much hyped place but average food and drink. Yet still recommending for one shot there
3
The title says it all. Overall experience was great. Just lack some wow in the food department. Very spontaneuos and knowledgeable waiting staff, except for one of them.
5
The restaurant is located 1 storey below the roof top. I can't remember if it is on the 61st or 62nd floor. It's at the end of the first lift. The atmosphere is pleasant with nice deco and great views. The food was excellent on a 5 course diner, and the wine and service were fine. Not cheap, but well worth it
3
Celebrated Valentine's here and had a wonderful time dining here. The food and drinks were sumptuous and value for money base on the quality of food and ambience.Service were acceptable but could be better should they have left us alone more. Overall still a good experience

We had our Directors' Dinner there on 1 Dec 2014. The view and the ambience were great and the food delightful. To say the service was not up to par is an understatement. The manager (I assumed because he was in a sloppy suit) looked unkempt and distracted. He was very anxious to do a roll call every time the guests arrived (there were 13 of us and we came in batches). We hardly sat down and he came marching with his clipboard to ask, "Your name?" There was no greeting and we were not even given a chance to get a drink. He barked his questions instead of asking. And when he needed to make space for the sharing plates, he came and literally swept all my glasses from my right to the left. And for my colleague seated on my right, from left to right. When I placed them back to my right after drinking, he came marching back and swept them to my right again. Almost impatiently (because I had obviously inconvenienced him). When he came to the table to serve the food, he would barged between us abruptly. I appreciate the fact that perhaps he is not doing the above deliberately to spoil our evening but he definitely need to be more deliberate in becoming a better wait staff. I dare say the more junior wait staff there were a lot more gentle and courteous when serving us. It is a shame though because this restaurant is not cheap. And with such a view, most people would expect the experience to be memorable. And the service is so for the wrong reason

Unbeatable view - being the highest restaurant in Singapore on the 62floor of OUB Centre - we were looking down on the roofs of every building around us. Get a table by the window but not if you're scared of heights! The hostess Liyana answered my online reservation promptly and called me on the day itself to confirm. She offered me the 2nd seating at 9pm so I could get a window table. Let them know if you're celebrating a birthday and they'll put a candle and Happy Birthday words written on your dessert. Had the Hokkaido uni for appetiser - who'd a thought that chocolate in soya sauce would taste so good? For mains, we had the 3-meat platter to share between the 2 of us - hubby said the USDA sirloin was the best he's ever had! And for dessert, we had the white choc basil mille feuille with yellow kiwi sorbet - wanted to order more but they had taken the last order. Will be back again for lunch to check out the day time view

Like most of Singapore drinking is pricey and for a truly 360 view of the city this is the place to see it. The drinks are nothing special but the views are spectacular on the 68th floor. With ample seating, live band it was great to catch up with friends over stunning views. Unfortunately the rain cut our visit short with a stampede of people moving indoors, but on a summer night it would have been perfect

Great and spectacular views of Singapore
One of the best I have seen across the world
It is a wonderful experience sipping beer on the roof top and enjoying the breeze
The set menu was ok
4
Very good food, and the set menu is excellent value. Unbeatable views. The only blip on my lunch was some mix up over the card payment, but it all got sorted in the end. Well recommended.
4
Its all about the setting of this lovely bar at the rooftop. Its got the best view in Singapore. They have a live band playing retro music on thrusday. It was really good.
4
The price to get in is to high; the music is to loud (for an old guy like me) and I always seem to forget my way when trying to find the building so I walk longer than I have to and end up arriving with a shirt soaked in sweat. BUT, the view is spectacular. I have been to most rooftops in Singapore and none comes close to this. Not only do you get a unobstructed 360 view; you also get to look straight down on the city (.while most rooftop bars have a ledge between the fence and edge of the building, this one has the glass "fence" right on the edge) including a great birds eye view of Boat Quay. I take all my visitors to Singapore here

Visited the restaurant during restaurant week 2014 - Surprisingly the restaurant is not crowded despite the week. With not many tables filled, atmosphere was nice and right, service was also prompt and attentive enough.The presentation of all the dishes were nicely done up, I think portions were just right for the 3 course meal too.Service was attentive but fair, could have been better with such a high class restaurant.Atmosphere was definitely perfect with the window seat tables, the view was breathtaking.I think the price during restaurant week made it worthwhile, should try once in a lifetime with the view and food to die for - provided that one gets the window view table and the price of it was right like during Singapore restaurant week
2
This place has huge potential with amazing views and decor but the food doesnt really match the high standards. Less is more and the chef so just tone down things a bit as they try really hard to be chic. Service is good and attentive but in my opinion if it wasnt for the view it's not worth going just for the food.
4
We went for dinner 9 adults and 6 children 2-6 and quickly realized that it is not suitable for kids but the staff did everything possible to make us feel comfortable they even took the kids away just before serving our main courses so we can dine in peace and later when we went to the top to enjoy the view. The food was exceptional and the whole thing exceeded our expectations

My husband and I enjoy fine dining and do not mind paying for quality experiences. We have dined in many high class establishments around the world and are happy to pay high prices for quality. The experience at Stellar however, was highly disappointing, largely due to the outrageous prices. I had read reports from previous reviewers and I was expecting an expensive meal but not to the extent of $600 for a non premium glass of champagne, a beer, a bottle of averaged priced wine and a degustation of 5 courses each. Yes, the view is spectacular but no nicer than the Altitude restaurant overlooking Sydney Harbour or from the Eiffel Tower. The food was nice but not exceptional. However, the dessert prepared at the table was wonderful. The ladies bathroom was grubby. There had obviously been a wedding reception in the afternoon in another room and it appeared that the toilets had been well used and not cleaned for the next clientele. The back of the doors were damaged exposing chip marks on the black paint. I have been in public toilets that were in a better state. When you are paying top dollar, you expect the best. The price for the experience unfortunately left a bad taste. I would recommend trying another premium restaurant that is rated highly through trip advisor

Are you in for mid week or any day of the week for dragon mojito..the view of singapore shall make it taste stronger. For single night out or corporate event, this is to go place to heal your soul and feed your eyes with panorama. All is good here at the roof top..against the entrance at the street level. The manager shall have to strongly workout with the welcome comity...the ground floor entrance treatment is unpleasant surprise. I've wandered..do I really want to go up to the top? Who knows what's expecting me there after this bulling experience at the ground floor. Still, the minimum spend 'must' is less than in other places..only..hey management..work with the welcome to the club stuff..needs adjustments :

I attended a company dinner one weekday dinner. We had called in a few days earlier to preorder our meals thinking it would help expedite serving the meal on the day itself. When some requested the set menu and others a la carte, the manager told us we could all either the set menu or all order a la carte. That's understandable. But the surprising thing was, if we ordered the set menu, we had to all order the same set menu! After making a phone call to the owner (whom my partner happens to know), the manager agreed to let us order a mix of our choice. I ordered the $95 set menu. The appetisers & desserts were fixed but we could choose our main dish. So I chose the tenderloin. When asked for the 'doneness', I said medium well. I was then told that I could only have it done either well or rare. That applied to the set menu. I could not choose anything in between. Simply ridiculous! As I generally do not like too much blood in my meats, I chose well done. What a terrible mistake that was! It was one of the worst pieces of meat I've had in my life, and I've had quite a number of meats before. It was a dry, tough, shriveled up piece of 'leather' that I eventually couldn't finish. Unfortunately, the appetisers and desserts couldn't make up for this disaster. The staff were 'functional'. They should learn to smile more. For the amount we spent (about $150/person) the experience was just not up to expectations. All in all, stellar at 1-altitude is simply overrated & over-priced. I won't be going there again anytime soon.

Food is not bad with good view. However, the service standard of the staff is inconsistent. Some staff have service excellence while some of the staff looked tired and are inpatient to serve you.
5
Outstanding view, pleasant service, great food. Make sure you've got plenty of cash, alcohol in particular is very expensive.

I came to Stellar after reading positive reviews on TripAdvisor. The view is exceptional-and the food is good, however for what is billed as a five star dining experience, I was a little disappointed.The flavors in the food are all there, it just did not blow me away. We both ordered the Suckling Pig-the cracking provided was a little rubbery and entree's were a bit bland so the overall dining experience whilst being enjoyable, for what I was expecting-I was slightly disappointed. The service however was very good. The rooftop bar is an exceptional view for after your dining experience
5
Came here with my folks who are visiting from Australia. The views are fantastic, even at night. We ordered the pork. It was really well presented and the flavours just worked well. Two of the others ordered the sea bass. The best description was it melted in my mouth and the almond purée was perfect. The wine list is great and priced from reasonable through to high end. There was a Krug champagne promotion happening at the same time so good company. The prices are what you expect for the location. Overall very happy Experiance

We made reservations for two of us to dine at Stellar 1 Altitude on Saturday 9th August for Singapore's National Day mostly so we had a great view point for the Marina Bay fire works but also to indulge in some fine dining. We opted for a non window seat as the minimum spend per person for this privilege was a little pricey. The restaurant wasn't as busy as I thought it would be considering the masses of queues on ground floor at the bottom of the escalator. Thankfully we were able to skip those queues and go straight up to Level 62 because of our reservation at 6.30pm. We were allocated our seats two rows back from the windows and the gentleman seating us pointed out the direction in which we should be able to see the fireworks about 8pm. About 20 minutes later, the same gentleman came by to let us know he had a window seat available in the emergency exit and he thought it would give us excellent views of the NDP and fireworks display. He was right, it was far superior to our original seating and a real treat for us visitors from Australia! We ordered rustic breads and condiments to start, the $140++ meat platter with mash, vegetables and condiments and a flaming baked Alaska to share for dessert as well as two bottles of wine (I drink white, my partner drinks red so we decided to splash out and get both). The breads were very nice along with their dips - eggplant, radish, olives (not a fan). The different meats we requested on our meat platter were cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the sauces which accompanied them were mostly delicious especially the mushroom and foie gras. The only thing which we were disappointed in is that the meats could have been served hotter or kept on a hot plate because after they had been sliced by our server they weren't very warm. The mash was amazing however my partner felt that there was only enough served for one person, not two (even though it's a platter for two to share). It was spread across the platter which looked very pretty but there wasn't in actual fact much of it on the platter at all. The vegetables were very very tasty. Our flaming baked Alaska was lit at our table and it was quite amazing to see the meringue "baking" in front of us. I thought this was an absolute treat and the dessert itself tasted amazing. The meringue could have been slightly better done as it was a little more like marshmallow than meringue but overall presentation and taste was top notch. The brownie underneath and the flavours of the strawberry and Madagascar vanilla ice cream were amazing. Yum! Overall our bill came to just over $400 which is probably the most I have ever paid in a restaurant and the food wasn't quite up to the standard I would expect when you are paying that kind of money. Hence the four stars instead of five. However I thoroughly enjoyed my evening, the servers were extremely helpful and friendly and we were lucky enough to be given window seats after all. Plus they let me take my half finished bottle of wine upstairs to the rooftop bar afterwards so we could finish our evening in style. They even took it upstairs for me and put it in a new bucket of ice when they sat us down. I was very impressed by this!Thank you Stellar at 1 Altitude and a very Happy 49th Birthday to Singapore!

Wonderful restaurant with spectacular view of the city - both inside the restaurant and on the roof-top bar. The food was exceptional and the chef was very accommodating to my special menu requests, especially my requests for substitutions. The dessert presentation is a "must" - how the desserts are prepared is as enjoyable as eating them

The restaurant is located at 60 over floors at 1 Raffles Place, at the heart of the Singapore Central Business District, with a breathtaking view overlooking the Marina Bay skyline. With nicely played music and picturesque scenery that could be deem an excellent experience even before the meal commences.Our meal began with various appetisers… Foie gras, pear, candied beetroot and onion salad. Nicely seared foie gras that melts in your mouth. The condiments, pear and candied beetroot, serve to bring out the flavor of the caramelized foie gras that was cooked in the pan to perfection. Salmon Mizuna roll, sashimi. An alternative Japanese meal appetizer. Perfect presentation of salmon wrapped sushi rolls, with tuna sashimi on the side on a long plate served with wasabi and soy sauce.Along with it came the visually appetizing soup with two to choose from.Silky mushroom soup with parmesan bruschetta. Toasted and slightly burnt parmesan bruschetta which brings out a nice fragrant and complement nicely with the mushroom soup emptied from a metal pot in front of the patrons (that leaves no bitter after taste). Inconsistencies were observed as each bowl was filled to different levels during the dining session.Zawai kani miso shiro. Seafood such as scallops and crab meat are presented stacked on a large lotus leaf in an empty bowl. As the pot of miso is emptied from the porcelain pot, the liquid gravitate to the bottom allowing the Lotus leave to partially envelope the ingredients and the soup. Very creative and kudos to the restaurant’s ingenuity for such well-presented and thoughtful experience.The main courses were no doubt well-presented and perfectly cooked.Roasted chicken breast lemon gnocchi, broccolini, caper butter. Soft and tender pieces of chicken breast served on a long plate with warm caper butter that brings out the perfectly roasted poultry. Prawn cappellini, ebi sukura, smoked uni butter. Generous serving of pasta, topped with ebi sakura and prawns that were lightly drizzled with prawn roe and smoked uni butter.Seared salmon sitted on top of potatoes slices with seafood thick broth and clams. The light cream seafood sauce accompanied well with the fish. Soft, sliced baby potatoes add a serving of carbohydrates that mixed evenly with the broth that were cooked with clams and soft beans.Selection of 4 artisanal cheeses with pear, muscatels, bread and crackers. A wooden cheese board with various restaurant offerings of cheese and fruits that came with a basket of warm bread and crispy chips

Stellar is a great place to get a fabulous view of Singapore and to have an elegant and surprisingly (for the surrounds) inexpensive lunch.Service was very good however the food needs a little attention. Not that it was bad, just not as good as you would expect from the surrounds and the menu. Slow braised ribs were still a bit chewy rather than melt in the mouth and the soup was a bit bland. Maybe it was just an off day, everything tasted a bit under seasoned

We chose the Stellar as I am skyscraper and view lover: I was not disappointed by this point with a seating right in front of MBS. We got a window table - a definitively must have I think ! (mini. charge per cover is superior if you have a window table). We went for a 6 courses degustation menu (135$++). We did different choices on purpose. Great courses are salt beef (+15$), scallops, duck, truffles gnocchi. These were really good and would deserve 4 stars on tripadvisor. Unfortunately, they are also the others… 2 ways crab as a starter; nothing impressive, a king prawn salad; absolutely ridiculous, I think a 2 years old child can make green leaves and slice a king prawns in two, this course is almost an offense for the standard of the restaurant. Then lamb, almost raw and not warm enough, not specially tasty, sea bass was good. As desert we had the chocolate bomb and the Alaska something- nothing crazy but eatable. They "make" the desert in front of you, I am not sure it adds added value, it just raise expectations that there are not able to reach.Overall, the service was good. The temperature in the room was way too cold. Bonus point: free access to the rooftop bar, view of course.Minus: the standard of the food served is a shame for the potential of the place and the price paid.Seeing the number of scenic view restaurants in Singapore, it is highly unlikely I will come back, I would prefer try others, being 100% sure that I will find better for this price
5
My partner and I did not have a reservation but were seated at a lovely table. The service was impeccable.Food was so delicious! It's pricey but definitely worth it. Have the bomb Alaska for dessert. Yum!You can go up to the bar on the roof top for free after your meal
5
Superb service and food. Undivided service was rendered to us and my kid. Exceed our expectation and will definitely return for more.
5
Nice view, fantastic food, excellent service. We will definitely come back on our next special occasion!
5
Excellent 4 course tasting menu. Great service including the theatre of dessert prepared at your table. topped off by a stunning view over the bay from the 62nd floor.
3
Great experience! Nice ambience! The staff were friendly, and good with their recommendation. The lobster dish was too oily for my preference. The oyster was v fresh. The dessert performance was great but the taste of the flaming Alaska was not that fantastic.
5
Excellent service, esp from Nicole with her heartwarming smile. The food was yummilicious n the presentation was excellent. Ambience was fantastic. We had indeed chosen the right place to celebrate our anniversary n my birthday this year:))
4
Came here for a special occasion with my girlfriend. I ordered a 5 course tasting menu.... I ordered the eel and the scallops for the starter, both were excellent, then for the main I ordered the risotto. This was also exceptional. Desert however was a bit more disappointing, I ordered a creme brulee and their baked Alaska, the presentation for the desert was very good but the actual taste was a different matter. The creme brulee was average and the baked alaska was quite poor. Overall The meal was very nice I would just avoid the desert menu next time

My wife and I are on our honeymoon from Australia and it was also her birthday the night we went to Stellar. We were greeted at the ground level and promptly headed up the speedy elevator to the 62nd floor. We were shown to our seats and had amazing views of Singapore from our by the window table.We opted for a sort of degustation by selecting 6 different dishes each and tasting each others plates. We figured that this was a good way to experience many different dishes from the awarded culinary menu. And boy were we right. We were rewarded with amazing flavors and impeccable food presentation. Although happy to have sampled so many dishes, in my opinion 4 taste samplers would have been enough.On top of this the service was the best I've had from any fine dining experience. Our server Sheila was not only very courteous and pleasant, but was willing to answer any and all questions and even have a laugh with us! Then when our desserts came they were prepared right in front of us with a personalized message too (see picture)!! We really were treated like VIP, especially at the end of the night we were even treated by Sasha, the assistant manager. Obviously because it was both our honeymoon and my wife's birthday, she personally escorted us to their rooftop bar one level up and provided us a glass of champagne to toast our night, and with 360 degree views of Singapore, it was a special way to finish the night.So although the venue is of a higher price tag, it is well worth the experience both in atmosphere and culinary respects. Thank you again to Sheila and Sasha for their help in making our special night that much more special. Look forward to returning on our next trip to Singapore

Booked a table for 3 for Easter brunch - sparkling wine, champagne and all. What really impressed us was the service and the variety of meat. There is a private area in the back so it you're in a group of 15-20 people, I would highly recommend booking that. Kudos

Spent $160++ per person. Husband bought me there for my birthday dinner this year so this was meant to be a celebratory dinner for a special day. The food was mediocre food for the price paid, and we couldn't even finish some of the mains that we ordered.  The service level was way below average. Staff's attitude was cold and indifferent (you can tell they are just there because they had to be there). The sommelier (I assumed he was the sommelier, since he served us the wine list and made some attempt of recommendation) kinda gave us the cold shoulder after we said we will look through the food menu first before the wine list. The waitresses were not entirely very well trained in recommending dishes/ describing the foods when served (to the extent, saying the corn pancake is like popcorn but without any taste to it -- hmmm, that type of description really don't sound very appetizing). We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters for appetizer, and a Bellini. The Bellini was drinkable, but not worth $28. We ordered the Select 4; and Select 5 from the Stellar Gastronomic Menu, so basically, was able to taste most of the items in the menu. Oysters were fresh and the accompanying condiments taste great. However, none of the mains stood out and were tad disappointing. Aglio uni & Crab in 2 Japanese style were decent, while the suckling pig was hard to finish. We only took one bite of the french chicken and gave up.None of the waiters bothered to check up or ask how the dining experience was during or after the meal. We even have some difficulty asking for the bill as the waiters and sommerlier were occupied in their own conversations at one corner to take notice of the diners at the window seats trying to get hold of their attention. Compared to prior nice dining places that are great for birthday celebrations, Stellar gave us the worst experience till date esp in terms of their service. While the view from the restaurant is nice, I think the quality of food and service are more important to me. For this price, there are a lot great options out there, so this is definitely a 'no-revisit' for me ever
3
Was a very average experience, it seems they are really running on reputation. What place demands $150 ++ per person to sit at the window only to have people wonder over at any time to stand over you looking out the windows. The food is nice but again when you are required to pay $150++ per person one would expect the level of service to be first class. Not say the people aren't nice but it is obvious there are more "chefs" than there are wait staff.There are other places that are more value for money and still have the view
5
It was a awesome brunch, view was nice, food was great. Best of all the service was excellent!
Must try: roasted lamb leg, French toast and the strawberry crumble!

I read fantastic reviews from different places online so I decided to try it out here for my first dating anniversary. Both of us are pretty new to high end dining experience.The waitress were pretty helpful suggesting to us the popular food here, but I think the staff here could bring on more smile. Sometimes I also have a hard time grabbing attention of the staff here when there are many customers, so that is definitely minus points for us.For the food, the portions were decent, but only some were really fantastic in taste, others just range from unique to overbearing (eg: too salty).. The Kobe C was a bit disappointing, I find the beef too hard to chew (I am in no way veteran in beef tasting). The price of food to me was overpriced in general, although they may be using premium ingredients and well trained chefs.The highlight of this place is the window seat. Great views of MBS and Singapore flyer as well as nearby high-rise building. The windows are reflective so it definitely affects my photo taking experience, but it is a fantastic experience viewing from top ther

Great place for a business dinner. If you have a reservation at Steller, you can also visit the rooftop bar and enjoy a drink or two before or after the dinner. Excellent views of the entire city of Singapore - and overlooking Marina Bay Sands. Food was good too. Quite expensive, and more business like environment

Went there to celebrate advance Christmas with my boyfriend last year. I made an reservations at 9pm however when we arrived there, the host told us that our table is not ready. We then went up to the rooftop to have a drink. When we seated down, i know we were the last customers but the service staffs seem to rush us in ordering. When we asked where the oysters came from, the server just brushed us with " somewhere in France". We do had some food product knowledge background. The housepour wine were dissappointing too. I had a pinot noir that taste off and the colour was as dark as a shiraz. We ordered a 5-6 courses degustation menu, we ordered all different varieties. All went well until there were 2 serving of pork dish. I did not like the pork dish, was a dissappointing one, thus it was probably they forgot about my lamb rack. I called the person-in charge and yet he walked so slowly,service recovery was real slow. He came back telling me that lamb rack was not available.I was upset because he could just inform us from the start instead of replacing a dish on his own accord. So i ordered a Blue fin Tuna,then he came back telling us that he had a lamb dish. we decided to take it. despite long cooking time, it was worth the wait as some of the dishes tasted pretty average. The dessert part was pretty engaging as there is a chef plating the dessert in front of you. Overall, we were dissappointed about the food especially the service. We were the last Customer, from afar, we could see service staffs near the bar taking selfie shots while waiting for us to leave. Furthermore, service recovery was not properly recovered. We did enjoy the window view, however we felt the food and service could further much improved to match the overall ambience. Music could play a classical music, showing the atas overall ambience

Amazing views! If you can, get a seat next to the window to see the light show from marina bay sands. A bit pricey but the extremely professional, formal service, and amazing food is worth it. We had the oysters and they were some of the best I have had! Afterwards, have them get you a seat at the Altitude bar upstairs. It is open air and has great cocktails
4
Made a reservation and we were still early. Started off with drinks at the bar below and then proceeded to dinner at Stellar. The place was amazing! Loved the views, definitely not the place to be if you're afraid of heights. We shared a couple of starters and each took a main course. Ordered a bottle of champagne and personally had the whiskey tasters. Total bill came out to less than what I expected
4
Was there for a birthday celebration. Had lunch over there. Fortunate to have the window seats which is on a first come first serve basis. On the other hand you gotta spend 150per pax in order to get those by the window seats during dinner time.Definitely a good place for celebration but you gotta get the window seats else there isn't anything fascinating
4
This was my first trip to Stellar and I took clients for lunch. The view is spectacular and the midweek set lunch well priced. The food was an eclectic mix but tasty. The service was slow - which goes against the grain of a set lunch

The Good =)~Amazing view.~Cheaper than KU DE TA, its competitor at nearby Marina Bay Sands.The Bad =(~Expensive fine dining.~If unlucky, you maybe given a table with no view.My Tip for future visits:~Call early to get a table at the window thus with a better view

Having eaten at the worlds highest (in a building) restaurant, At.mosphere in Dubai, it made sense to try out Singapores equivalent for dinner. I was very surprised, and in a good way. We were fortunate enough to get a table right by the window, and wow, what a view. Service in Singapore can be patchy, it certainly wasn't here. They were on the ball through the whole of the dinner service. The food was excellent, drinks the same. The dessert platter is something to behold as well, we did struggle through it all though. Four of us ate, all different things, with no complaints from anyone throughout. Really good, not just for Singapore, for anywhere, especially so as one of those venues I tend to wonder if they will try...excellen

We chose to eat at the stellar restaurant as apposed to paying $30 each to visit the 1-altitude bar, figuring we may as well get something for the entrance fee.I booked the morning of the visit on a Thursday evening and had no problems getting a table, I was asked if I wanted to sit by the window - a €300 spend was needed to do so. I don't agree with being told how much I must spend in a restaurant I think that's kind of ridiculous so I turned down the offer (don't get me wrong I ended up spending more than €300 anyway).On arrival the restaurant was near empty so we was given a seat by the window anyway.. The view from the window was amazing! The majority of Singapores skyscrapers were dwarfed!When we arrived the staff wasn't very attentive, I assumed as I didn't arrive looking like I was going to be spending a lot - rather pretentious I thought.We went on to order starters and mains, as soon as we ordered some reasonably expensive meals the staff seemed to pay us a lot more attention, again rather pretentious..The food was very good, I had read a lot of reviews saying it was very average, but i'de have to disagree. I've eaten in a lot of 'fancy' places and the food here definitely met expectations.. The only disappointment was that the mains arrived before we had chance to finish the starters - assumably because the restaurant wasn't very busy.For desert the chef came to our table and basically made desert in front of us with some very impressive showmanship, setting the frozen Alaska on fire and making the chocolate bomb explode, this was fun, a very nice touch!Once we had finished we were a little hurried to the 1-altitude bar before we had finished our drinks which again was a bit annoying.To sum up the food was great, expensive, but no more than a nice resteraunt in the UK - and you won't get a view like that anywhere else!We felt a little rushed by the waiters, but this may have just been them being overly attentive, it wasn't too much of a problem.Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed the experience and agreed we would visit again

Being going here for sometime as the value for set lunch midweek along with the views is unbeatable.Last two occasions however have not been so good so i am less likely to return if it is I that is booking lunch.Got plastic in my main dish only to be laughed at by the waitress when i told her. She said she will speak to the chef to see how it got there. Maybe she did but she certainly did not report back to me or apologise. I just had to complain to the manager, who said it was just from the melted butter. Regardless of where he thought it came from it should not of been there, as if i swallowed it it could of cut my insides as it was a sharp hard plastic piece. He did refund some of the cost, which was the best he could do in the circumstances.Would I return? Yes i did only to have to complain again. Used to get complimentary bread but it cost SGD10. Had to wait 20 min for it to arrive and the restaurant had more staff than customers. The menu appeared to have changed as we had only a la carte handed to us. When I asked about 3 course he said we only do 4 and upwards but only for dinner, which i said but we are here for lunch..... so what can i order. He said we can order from the dinner menu but it would be charged a la carte. I went on to mention that i used to also be provided with a set menu that was 2 - 3 courses. He said ok I will get you that menu. Why were we not given that also? Is it because they thought we had not been there before and would order from the expensive menu? If the opening of mineral water that we didn't order is anything to go by I would say it is sneaky sales peeking its ugly head again. We ordered one still at SGD8.5 a bottle and one sparking at SGD9 a bottle (twice the size almost to the still) but two member of staff open two more still and started to pour and we did not even order it. We sent them on their way. I see them go to the till and adjust the bill. Just show they were quick to put it on their before they fetched them! Why do restaurants do that? It is rude, cheeky and frustratingly annoying. Enough to make you never go back so they loose out long term by trying to win short term. The sparkling water was disposed of when it had two inches left in the bottom

The view is the strongest point from this restaurant on level 62 if you can overlook the Bay or get onto the bar on level 63. Food is good but not 5 star. At night, the view looking towards the Bay and down to the Marina Bay Sands is a highlight, best if you can be there as darkness falls. Plastic "glasses" unfortunately necessary for safety but do not detract from the experience.

We tried to go here for dinner and were told that we had to commit to a minimum $300 spend to sit by the window - or else we could sit in the middle of the restaurant (with no view) but had to commit to ordering 2 main courses. This is absolutely ridiculous. Don't tell me how much we have to spend or what I am required to order. The prior weekend we went to Salt Grill and Sky Bar on 55th floor of Ion Orchard and had an amazing meal and drinks - and our total bill came to almost $700 for my wife and I. So I'm prepared to spend the money, but I am not prepared to be told how to spend it or what the minimum required spend is

We were seated at a table by the window, probably because we had made reservations, and we were among the first to arrive for lunch shortly before noon. We tried a glass of sweet and sticky wine that turned out to be a port wine. We shared a bowl of lobster bisque and a roast suckling pig main course. The supervisor was very kind to let us share the main course because normally each diner must order one main course. But we made up for it by ordering a starter and desserts. The pork was excellent with apple and pear jelly. The lobster bisque appeared to contain a piece of pasta instead of lobster meat. We chose a special package with two desserts, and the dessert expert decorated a black square glass and put desserts on it, the most delicious of which was a mango ice cream delight. Service was friendly and considerate. It was quite an experience to look down on the SkyPark of the Marina Bay Sands. Stellar is so high up that we feel the view is better during the day when you can see more detail down on the ground. The lawn of the MRT Raffles Place park below looks like a valley among skyscraper cliffs. The view combined with the service and quality of the food add up to a very good experience

Our concierge recommended this restaurant and telephoned to make a reservation.He explained that the restaurant was situated on the 62nd floor with amazing views.We heard him 'sweet talking' the restaurant into giving us a window table.We approached the evening with modest expectations. It seemed quite likely that a restaurant with this sort of' 'pulling power, would not also be able to produce the goods food wise.How wrong we were.Fantastic views from our window table.Excellent service.Very interesting menu which dd not disappoint in any of our three courses.The Fondant was outstanding.After dinner we spoke to the Maitre:d' and complemented him on the meal and service.We asked him if the al fresco bar on the roof was accessible ( security on the lift was quite stringent when we arrived -- it's obviously one of 'the places to go'.Not only did he say yes but he escorted us in the lift and showed us around. Definitely a place to be seen but perhaps a little young for us!Anyway a great last night in Singapore.Go and have fun but make sure you get a table with a view

Went for lunch with some girlfriends recently. My last experience here at Christmas a few years back the service was slow but this time it was very prompt. Great table with a view of MBS. Set lunch a reasonable price of $32 (2 courses) and $38. I ordered pan-seared foie gras (additional cost), pork cheek with risotto and white chocolate dessert. My friend also ordered swordfish sushi for the table which was really tasty. The foie gras was decent, not the best I've had (alas, that was at St Pierre, RIP). The main was delicious although not quite as advertised. It was really more of risotto with meat, than a meat main with a side of risotto! Since I don't mind my carbs I was quite happy but my friend who also ordered it left most of her rice behind. The pork cheeks were crispy fried, I'd not had them that way before. Another friend ordered the tenderloin, that was really outstanding (another supplemental of about $8). The dessert was also not quite what I expected. From the description I expected something creamy but t was almost like a frozen kulfi. It didn't taste bad but had I known I might have skipped dessert and said the calories, it was just blah. Service was good, prompt as I mentioned, and unlike many top end Restos in Singapore nowadays, they have no issue serving normal tap water (cough*Sky on 57*cough!) and they were very good to keep refilling. A fun place for lunch, the dinner menu also looks interesting. I would say their strength perhaps more in the fusion Asian than their western dishes. Four of us having set lunches, no drinks other than coffees, paid $260 after taxes, etc

From the moment I arrived at Stellar I was impressed and was so until I left. I was very warmly greeted and escorted to a table against the glass with a breathtaking view of Singapore. I was seated on the opposite side of the restaurant to the Marina Bay Sands view so I mentioned to the waitress that I was hoping to see the laser show and wondered if I could pop up to the bar when it began. She said she would be sure to let me know when it started. The entree and main were divine - scallops 3 ways for entree and seafood ravioli for main. As I was settling in for dessert, the wattress came to tell me the laser show was starting and had arranged to move me to a table by the glass on the opposite side of the restaurant so I could enjoy the view. I got to enjoy the show while I enjoyed my dessert. After my meal I was given some macaroons to take home (which were soooo delicious) and was escorted up to the open air bar for a wine and some more soaking up of the incredible view. It was truly a memorable evening - great food, fantastic service and a stunning 360 degree view. Will definitely return next time I'm in Singapore

Restaurant is not within main building (1 Raffles Place). The entrance is from a tower block just next to Raffles Pace MRT entrance/exit. 62-storey high so gives good all-round view of Southern Singapore but was hazy that day. Was there for business event lunch so don't know the exact prices but expect it to be expensive. Food was good - nice presentation and tasty appetizers. The foie gras appetizer was generous and very good. Main courses like beef and fish were very good. Beef was large portion. Fish was fresh.Service was very good. Ambience good for discussions and meetings even romantic types.
4
The security at the front entrance was daunting and unfriendly. They somehow couldn't find my reservation that had been made a week ago and confirmed 3 hours earlier. Cold and unfriendly, they got our evening off on an unpleasant note. However once in, we loved the beautiful view from the 62nd floor with stunning views of the city. The sushi is amazing and almost the best we've ever had - Crab, spicy tuna, ebi prawn sushi were particularly unforgettable! Leave enough space for the desserts. 1-Caramel was a variety of caramel desserts that was all delicious! Chocolate bomb and baked Alaska were perfect. The sticky date pudding had a perfect consistency with a fragrant after-taste. The service in the restaurant was warm and thoughtful.
4
I was surprised at the S$25 cover charge, but a drink in SG is $20 anyway. The view is worth triple. Pay the $25, enjoy the cocktail and soak in the view. Spectacular!
2
Where do I start? The bored waiters standing round chatting adding to a generally desultory atmosphere? The prices? The wrong dessert being served? The amuse bouche served with no explanation of what it is? The doormen who are too busy talking to each other to order a taxi? The fact that 2hrs and 30minutes after the start of the second sitting you get quite firmly told you need to leave the restaurant? No, I think the generally arrogant atmosphere that you are somehow lucky to be allowed in.An extremely disappointing experience

Stellar was recommended to us by numerous friends. Always a good sign. We went for a special occasion. There are two sittings and its first come ,first served for a window seat with a spectacular view over Marina Bay. However the staff were very understanding and took into account our special request.All the staff are knowledgable and friendly. Just as well as the menu is a little confusing. The food is european, predominantly fresh influence and the food is fabulous as are the wines. We felt that for a special occassion it was well worth the extra dollars and it felt to be better value than Ku-De-Ta at MBS.The bar on the floor above, 1-Altitude , adds to the sense of occassion with 360 degree views over Singapor

I was impressed with the quality of food, wine, view and service overall. It's a good value for money. Sadly, my evening was ended unsatisfactory because of a hostess who didn't know how to talk to a customer properly. I wasn't informed when I made a reservation that the table would be released by 9 pm when she came to rush my friend and I to order dessert. I told her I wasn't informed but she insisted that it's a restaurant policy and I must be told. Why on earth did I have to lie to her? She spoiled my evening and I didn't order sticky date pudding and cappuccino to end my scrumptious meal. I may go back but not too soon. I don't mean to overreact but her way of insisting to imply that i didn't remember what I was told was outraged. Overall, it's a nice place to dine. The cheese soufflÃ© is very rich and yummy if you like salty taste.

after reading the reviews before I decided that the restaurant needed a break by me providing a review of the awesome anniversary dinner we had this year. We're local Singaporean and we couldn't getaway this year for our anniversary. But you know we just decided to be touristy in our own town. Had some expensive drinks on the rooftop bar, but the view was the saving grace. Too bad about the plastic cups instead of proper glasses. Had dinner at Stellar after drinks and was offered a non-window table. I think that was fine since I had enough of the view on the roof. In the middle of dinner was offered a seat near the window. Since food was great and service was attentive but not intrusive, decided to stay put and continued to get sloshed with champagne and entrees and main courses. I thought the price was decent considering the overall experience. Recommended for special occasions

The one and only benefit of this place is a stunning view. After reading the menu we were not excited to eat something. Service is just ok. It was just pity to go out and find another place for dinner. Pasta was the same like in a cheap non-Italian place, sushi - no comments ((((. Don't waste your time and find a street food place with a fresh seafood instead
4
Arrived and offered a seat in the middle of the room with no view at all. When we said we had asked the consierge to book a table with a view and would rather leave as the table was very poor we were taken to a room with a stunning view and the room was much darker and more atmospheric. We were delighted with the table. The resataurant menu was a little confusing but we had a lovely meal with attentive service and left very happy indeed
5
We had pre drinks at the roof top , where the 360 view of Singapore was mind blowing, and the bonus was we managed to catch the small firewroks & water display show of Marina Bay Sands too. Service staff were very attentive and we were ascotted to the main dinning hall for our dinner. We ordered various starters like the unagi rolls, the selection of communal tapas , of which the parfait and burata were to die for , main courses like the lamb,tenderloin beef , trout and sea bass were sumptuos . The final " show " of the desert that were presented on a long platter by the head chef himself , where he painted the platter with cholcolate and straberry sauce , flambe the fondant , caramlized the creme brulee and you get to have 6 different kinda of delicious and very nicely presented deserts all went down very well

After attending the Leeuwin estate wine dinner at Stellar last night, I am compelled to share the bad experience. Perhaps its best to give a sequence of events. 1 Altitude and Stellar arranged for Tim Lovett of the famed Leeuwin estate to attend a dinner, at which both Stellar's food and Leeuwin's wines would be matched, for all to enjoy. Price per head was advertised at S$150. All good so far, and the main attraction for me was to sample Tim's wines. On arrival, I was dismayed to receive the same abrupt, unfriendly reception from the bouncers at the building entrance that I received the first time I visited some months ago (remember, this is Singapore, and this is probably the only reastaurant/bar in the entire city that feels compelled to have burly chaps preventing goodness knows what - in Singapore its more likely people will scold each other for dropping litter, than picking fights). Heading up to the rooftop bar with my friend, we expected to enjoy the Leeuwin sparkling brut that was mentioned on the Stellar invite. Alas, we had no more than five minutes on the rooftop (and we arrived bang on time) before yet another bouncer was herding us down to the reataurant, at least with us hanging on for dear life to the thimble of bubbly they had reluctantly poured.At Stellar, we were seated for almost 20 minutes before we managed to coax someone into adding a splash of bubbly to the long empty glasses. The menu suggested that the starter would be matched with Leeuwin's Sav Blac Semillon blend, but most of us were served, and had eaten the starter, before the wine arrived (with a lone waiter trying to pour for well over 30 guests, and again pouring less than a sip or two for each person). At least he tried to be friendly though, what really got us going was the two "in charge" waiters, in their fancy red shirts and black jackets, who banged food onto the table, ignored requests for more wine, and had terrible attitudes (perhaps they did not like the bouncers either). The same process repeated itself over all the courses. A sip of wine, and if you were lucky you got it at the same time as the food. It was possible to buy the lovely wines on the night, but only for delivery, not for consumption at the venue. We (including Tim, the winemaker) offered to buy the wine, but were flatly told "no". Amazing - even Tim reluctantly conceded that he had not seen such reluctance to pour wine before. After all, wine is for driking, not just sniffing.This, on top of the fact that the invite mentioned a cost of $150 per head, only for us to find out they had forgotten to add the 10% service charge (unusual for Singapore and certainly not worth it) and the VAT. The good: the wine is really special, and the food at Stellar is certainly top class. And Tim was willing as always to chat about the wines and the industry. The bad: the service experience is not worth it, and I have rarely seen suck a highjack of someone's brand. Stellar should have been more clear that the evening was all about them, and not about Leeuwin's wines (and I would happily then have ignored the invite). Ivan van Niekerk - Singapor

Dinning at Stellar during the restaurant week was a bad experience. We order two drinks for aperitif and the drinks came 10 minutes after the starter. The starter (foie gras) was mediocre and the main course was correct (lamb shank) bur the overall presentation of the dish was bad. Finally, the dessert was very average and we ate when people were making a lot of noise cleaning up the place
5
This place is excellent; food, service, city view at level 62. Very impressive. I certainly recommend it.
4
had lunch and the set menu was excellent. well priced and food is good. i tried the pan fried fish and the sushi starters are a must. the view - however is the best part about it. it was a clear day and even through i have not been there for dinner, i can imagine the view during the evening would be breathtaking. i would definitely recommend an evening visit. service was good although nothing to brag about. staff had a slight mishap with our bill (brought the wrong one to the table), but otherwise it was smooth sailing
5
We were hosted to a dinner here with a spectacular view of the entire country. The rooftop bar is worth visiting as you have an unobstructed view in all directions. Food (all 8 courses) was creative and delicious. Wonderful experience and memory of our visit to Singapore
5
Don't miss this very exciting al fresco bar at the 63rd level of the OneRaffelsPlace tower in Singapore (next to Raffles Place MRT station). Dress appropriately (casual wear) and go for a drink, best time is dusk. The entry fee of 25 S$ includes one standard drink, albeit not of top qualitiy but the views will compensate for this. Don't forget your camera
5
Sammy Lee what an excellent dinning experience congratulations I commend all your wonderful group for such a brilliant night. We will highly recommend you we loved your swordfish rolls and the waygu beef so tender. I know I didn't meet my lobster but we had bumped into each other on our last diving excursion. Kind regards Kevin and Carol Sales Western Australia.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxsjRmN9syc&feature=youtube_gdata_playe

Located at One Raffles Plaza, Stellar on the 62nd floor is part of a bigger complex, Altitude, al fresco bar on the roof of the building and City Golf, below the restaurant on the 61st floor. Spacious modern setting, ideal for lunch or drinks and dinner. The menu offers a wide choice of fare including Japanese Sashimi and sushi rolls, a very good selection of aged hams from Spain and Italy and a great selection of grilled meats. The lunch menu starts at SGD 32 for a two course meal. Individual prices from SGD 18 for 50 grams of Prosciuto to SGD 180 for a kilo of Ribeye. The service staff is friendly if a little "undertrained"..

The Stellar must have upgraded their service since the 2011 reviews I saw. We went there tonite and was promptly served. Service was great and not intrusive. The food was very good. My wife loved the lobster velvet and even compared to the all time best lobster bisque we had. I had the baby chicken salad with fig which was almost like a main course. And the prawns with chilli was quite good. My wife had the suckling pig - an interest twist. My son enjoyed his lamb rack. The The best part of the evening was the dessert we sampled. We tried 6 different desserts and all were super. We were already quite full but somehow we were able to find space for the dessert!! !The evening was made even better by the help we got from David on the wine. He recommended the Woodstock Shiraz Cabernet and it was really very good!We will be back

We were in Singapore on a business trip and heard about this restaurant and decided to try it out. The restaurant is on the 62nd floor of the Raffles place, but to go up you have to get through the line at the bottom of the building. One important point to all those who want to try this place: MAKE RESERVATIONS. The place gets packed and you have to wait in line downstairs, if you donâ€™t have reservations. For weekends the reservations become even more important. Furthermore dress to impress, reasons for which will become clear in a bit. We all started with a sampler plate which was scrumptious. We tried the wagyu steak and it was definitely worth every penny. The steak was cooked medium which made it all the more delectable. Our seats were right next to the window, which is part of the allure of the restaurant, as the views are breathtaking. So all in all the restaurant is definitely on the expensive side, however with the view and the quality of food, I would highly recommend it for a night out on town, a prelude to a romantic night or just an expense account business trip dinner. There is a club on the very top of the building and once you eat at the restaurant, a jaunt out to the place is complimentary. The club is on the roof top and pretty cool. The cocktails are on the expensive side, but when you have already splurged on the restaurant a few more dollars will barely make a dent
4
Great View and great food but that comes with a deep pocket too.Once you finish your dinner there, remember to move 1 level up to 1-Altitude for booze (free entry for diners) The view at Altitude is better than what U get from SkyPark.U get to see MBS from here too... If you're lucky U might see some laser light from MBS.
5
It may not be the cheapest meal in town, but well worth it for the wonderful view. We started in the bar on the 61's floor whilst waiting for our table. Drinks cost a fortune but ho hum. We then went up to the roof 63 floor staggering views in daylight. Down to meal early sitting. So we saw the sun go down. Meal was excellent good food and a glass of Moet made us feel special. The staff were very attentive and helped to make it a good evening. We then ended the night with another visit to the roof and photos in the dark. Brilliant looking down on all the other attractions in town. All in all one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore. A must do at least once. But make sure you book and are early to get a good table
5
having gone to the other restaurant at the top of singapore, i can say that 1-altitude has top class service, yummy food and the view was astonishing. my friend and i had a fabulous time.
a must try place when you visit singapore!

With a few days to spare post Christmas, trying a few of the different dining venues each with their own twist (and which there is an abundance of in Singapore these days), was something I was looking forward to. And so to the 62nd floor of the OUB office building right in the middle of Singapore's business district, where Stellar the restaurant is situated, and has of course quite breathtaking vista point of the Singapore night views.As one gets out of the lift ride it feels a touch like entering a night club as indeed the entrance welcomes to both the dining venue as well as the upper open air deck which is a club for the late hours, which we planned to transition to after dinner.At our restaurant table we could see the Singapore Marina, the well known Marina Bay Sands hotel with Casino, and much of Singapore. It was I would add a very over air-conditioned restaurant as the shawls provided which were brought to us, were very much a requirement until we had had a chance to warm up over a glass of wine or two and probably at least after our first course! We even asked if the air-conditioning could be turned down however were promptly informed that it was all centrally controlled.The food was vaguely interesting though not "stellar", though I imagine sufficiently interesting for most who were probably drawn to this restaurant as much for its view as for its cuisine. We added oysters to our appetiser course and had pork belly and lamb for our mains both which were tasty but not spectacular. We did not have desserts as we decided we needed to warm up and go to the open air upper deck for after dinner drinks.Here is where this venue does come into its own. Spectacular views and on this evening a strangely enjoyable DJ mix of 80s music, made for a really quite exotic blend of ambience. The extraordinary view can be appreciated from relaxing rattan seats, lined along a glass paned edge which feels quite unbridled and lets you feel at one with the altitude and the club mix.Certainly worth the visit for the view and memorable for that alone. Go try it for yourself

I attended a meal here with colleagues for a pre-Christmas lunch and while the views are spectacular and offer a great view of some of the other significant landmarks from up high, the service and menu was limited.I had the soup, artichoke, but which was overly doused in truffle oil, making it heavy and a little repeating.The seabass was overly salted and meagre.Our wine waitor forgot about us for about half an hour so we had to neck our last glass to get back to the office in time.As prices were fair, it was worth it for the view but we probably won't go again
5
This restaurant is excellent with good food and wine and not overly expensive. What makes it amazinh however is thats its 280metres up in the air and the bar upstairs on the roof has the best view in Singapore with funky music and cool drinks. a must if you're in Singapor
5
We arrived a little early for our 12 noon lunch booking so the restaurant hadn't opened. The greeter suggested we had a drink in the bar. A good selections of wine by the glass and cocktails. When we were ready for lunch the barman took out drinks to the table for us. The lunch menu consists of 2 choices for each course with a 3rd choice available at a supplement . Food was delicious, just the right portions size for lunch, at $38 for 2 courses exceptional value. Staff are charming and the views are breathtaking. A wonderful experiance

We visited a number of the 'restaurants with a view' on our break to Singapore.The restaurant is pretty hard to find as there is building work going on at 1 Raffles Place... when you find it then a pretty grumpy host meets you and you get a ride to the top floor of this v v high building!I don't know if we picked a 'bad night' but they had a couple of big tables in and didnt seem at all focused on what they were doing.Given this place is not inexpensive and many reviewers use it for a 'special night' then the service, food and overall experience was terrible.Food - had to send back a main course of Pork Belly for being cold, tasteless and very poor cut/cooking of the pork.Service - no real ownership of the table so lots of different waiting staff who frankly need to decide why they are in the service industry as they didnt seem to want to know.Manager - by the end of the entree's I was ready to walk out... so we asked for the bill..again a 15 min wait.. so the manager got it!! He removed everything other than the wine from our bill.... we went downstairs and walked over to Clarke Quay for a meal instead.Lastly, they confirmed a window table but when we arrived there were none free... so don't assume the reservation requests will be met.Overall I would give this a miss.... we went the night after to the Tippling Club and had one of the best meals of our lives!Any questions just ask

Was there on a Wednesday to celebrate anniversary with my boyfriend. We reserved a seat a few days in advance. Turns out that even on a weekday, there will quite many people (most of them are foreigners)We went there, was ready to try their Stellar Special Menu 2011, which I saw online on their webpage (The $120 ++ per person set dinner) and the waitress told me that the special menu is meant for at least 10 persons. I feel that this can't be possible as in that special menu, Patisserie platter (to share), there is a selection of 3 types for 2 pax, 4 types for 3 pax and 5 types for 4 paxs and above. So, how can it be possible that the set dinner is only meant for at least 10 persons?Anyway, was quite disappointed as I feel that it's more worth it to have the set menu than ordering from the ala carte menu.We ordered the Sashimi Moriawase (assorted daily selection of sashimi) 5 types that costs $55++, Quail salad $24++, Wagyu ribeye $75++, US Striploin $65++, Patisserie x 3 $20++, cappucino $10++ and Sparkling water at $10++. Total bill is $304.84.The best part of the meals was the steaks. The rest of the food was so-so only. In my opinion, my table area was quite dim, in fact too dim already as I can't really see the food that I was eating. The air-con was also too cold. Waitress and waiters were attentive and polite though.I have a fine experience there but I guess that it will be my first and last time there as I feel that everything is too overrated
4
The restaurant is located at Level 62 and has its own private elevators.The waiting area of the restaurant was small, unimpressive and dimly lit.There was a queue of guests waiting to be shown to their tables. It took almost 5 minutes for me to be ushered to my table as there was only 1 usher. Disappointing to say the least since it was lunch time peak period.Restaurant was bright lit with natural lighting from the open windows and white colored theme and decor. I had an awesome view of the Marina Bay area from my table.Our appetisers and main course took about 30 minutes before they were served and we had to remind the waiters to check our orders as we were not even served any bread for some time after our orders were taken. Ordered the 2 course set lunch at S$32.My order of the sashimi and sushi (appetiser) and the rib eye steak (main) were well presented. Altho the menu said salmon for my appetiser - i was surprised when they served sword fish instead which wasnt expressly stated on the menu. However, appetiser was tasty and fresh.The roast beef was superb and delicious - one of the best I've eaten. Definitely would come back to eat here again - hoping service will improve by leaps and bounds tho

What a missed opportunity....with such a great view this restaurant has a tremendous head start. But the service on both my visits this month and last was incredibly slow and haphazard, if well meaning. 2 hours for two courses (there wasn't time left for dessert, and coffee finally came after I had signed the bill) is just not acceptable. The food was good, not great, but spoilt by unnecessarily 'cheap' touches such as serving hawker-style coffee instead of the real thing - but very clearly charging for the latter. I'm afraid it's third time unlucky for me - I won't be going back again. I can always catch the view from my office for free if that's the main attraction....

Why is this place not in guide books? We easily got a table on a Saturday night at the last minute. The food was gorgeous, best sushi I had ever had. My chilli prawns were just spicy enough and so beautifully presented. The desserts rock, you go and choose your own from the patisserie. And the view, don't think there is better in Singapore. We got the full light show from the Marina Sands. For 4 people at a high end restaurant with wine, Â£150. amazing value. Try and keep the secret!!!!
