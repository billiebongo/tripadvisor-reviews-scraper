Just too overhyped!
1. Pig intestines could be cut smaller.
2. Prawns could be deveined.
3. EXTRA Soup doesn't have to be charged at $1 a bowl.
4. Ice Drinks (milo and kopi) were dilute.
Meh.

Really delicious prawn Mee, but had to wait a while for the food. Parking is also an issue, as this place is in a residential area.

It looks like you would not want to eat there from the outside. But this place is loved by locals from all over town. Very tasty prawn noodle soup or „dry“ and some bizarre looking innards dishes I never dared to try. Cheap, lively, popular and great for lunch or a late night meal.

Been twice within a month for lunch with wife. Best to arrive before noon. Otherwise long wait. Queuing system is great. Place and pay for your order and given a tag. Look for a seat and collect your food once your tag number is electronically displayed. While waiting you can cross the road to do a takeaway of the chinese style crispy style.Both ribs and prawns are tasty as with the stock. They also provide you with a folded paper tray to hold the discarded pork bones and prawn shells so that tge table is not so messy to clear for the next guy breathing down your neck waiting for a seat

I have been here many times. I got to know this place as I used to work around Hoe Nam area. Most people who love it will love their soup broth. I'm pretty health conscious, hence usually I don't finish the soup, and I order dry noodles all the time. But I must say the soup is really good because you can taste the 'rawness' of the thick broth soup. It's different from others as others usually sieved out the concentrate. So though due to my health consciousness, I will still drink abit of the soup The noodles are nice! Though it's just normal noodles but it's always cooked well, not over or undercooked. On top of that, they have various combination of ingredients to go with their noodles. Pork rib is what I always go with it, and it's really nice !

Have been to this prawn noodle shop twice. Compared to another prawn noodle shop Blanco, this one although pricey but the ingredient they put in is alot. Prawns comes in one full prawn unlike the other shop which cut the prawns into half. They also have prawn with abalones, prawns with pig tails, and many other combination of prawn noodles. And if you don't like the trouble to peel the prawn shells, just order the small prawn noodle. The prices are reasonable considered the portion size. Staffs are friendly and they are very organised. Will definitely go back again. Oh yes, they have fish cakes for side order. Not bad too

I wanted to try this establishment because of good reviews and located near my home. The soup was a little sweet but very tasty and the prawns were nice size. The pork ribs were very nice and a generous portion for the combo. I've never had pig's tail, but it was very nice and tasty. All in all, I was very satisfied and I will come back again for a quick and delicious meal

Dine at around 11.20am to avoid having to wait for a table.The prawn noodle, pig intestine noodle, pork rib noodle are truly good and tasty... especially the soup. Starting off at $4.70 it burns your budget. Another $1 if you want extra soup. Add 50c for more fried onions. Fishcake at $1. Can of Kickapoo kicks you back $1.50. Daunting for a coffeeshop setup that is spartan and not airconditioned. Factor in the lack of car parking facilities.Closed on Mondays. Otherwise, their business hours is from 6.30am to 4.30pm

This is quite popular prawn noodle shop in the area and is always crowded during lunch. They sell Singapore style prawn noodle, a good to try Singapore hawker food. A bowl of noodle cost probably from $4 SGD up depends on the size and what you want to add in the noodle.The soup is definitely very nice

I was actually working nearby MacPherson industrial estate and I didn't know there is such a great place for good prawn noodles! Had a friend gathering and I ordered big prawn noodle soup with small pig intestines which are such a rarity to find! Because it is an open coffee shop and extremely popular, if you don't mind the weathering heat and some time to wait for a table, this is one of the prawn noodles in Singapore to try
