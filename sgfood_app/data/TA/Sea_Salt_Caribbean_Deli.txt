Our favorite stall in Pasarbella, runned by real Caribbean people. Great music which enlifts the complete Caribbean vibe. Food is really good, varying from real Caribbean food, pork knuckle, salads, Mexican quesedillas, milkshakes, cocktails and much more.
This is a must try!

Ok, before you dive into this review, you should be clear about what kind of diner you are. Are the kind of diner that will forgive poor food if the ambience, service and experience are novel or the kind who could care less about where you're squatting, sitting or standing as long as it's to taste something sublime? In the spirit of full disclosure, I personally fall squarely in the latter camp. The food is the only focus, everything else is structured around this one true thing.Wet tacos. It all comes down to the food for me in the end. I ordered a plate of 3 tacos forgoing all the silly extras, just wanting to see what they could do with the taco concept in tropical Singapore, and they unforgivably messed it up. The cardinal sin? Microwaved meats. You get some nice chicken or pulled pork and keep it refrigerated and heat it up in a microwave, you expect moisture aplenty and not the good kind that's sealed in the meat, the kind that bleeds out of the meat macerating the tortilla and running down the astonished diner's forearm.I don't want to say any more. Vitriol is not my thing. Please rethink and reengineer the tacos or don't serve them at all. Rethink the price point if you have to, but please stop serving these runny tacos. Singaporeans who don't know any better will go away win an enduring scorn for all things Mexican all because they had a soppy taco at Seasalt. Just not right

Nestled among the shops in Pasarbella, you will suddenly come across pork knuckles stacked 3 deep. Prices are cheaper than other fancy places but taste is beyond the price value. Plus, you are not restricted to just dining from this deli as the place offers a variety of food to complement

I salivated when I passed by and saw their Pork Knuckles on the display counter. And so I ordered one and it turns out that It really is a big serving worthy to be shared by 2-3 persons! The meat is not fatty. It is mosly lean yet tender and juicy. They would actually chop it down and take away the bone for your convenience. They also took time to deep fry the skin of the pork hock to make it crispy. It is served with tomato based sauce, baked various root crops and leafy greens on the side. All this for a freakin' SG$16! How amazing is that!? Just great!The service is quite fast, you won't be waiting long. And you can actually watch your order being prepared/chopped in front of you.The stall is inside the Pasarbella Farmer's Market. The place can be crowded on a weekend lunchtime but dinnertime is manageable to get a good spot to eat your hunt. There is a nice vibe with all the decorations and lightings surrounding the area.There are plenty of parking space in the Turf Club area

The food stalls at PasarBella set a very high standard but arguably our favourite stall is Sea Salt Caribbean Deli run by Ivan from the Dominican Republic. Ivan has been in Singapore for eighteen years, mostly with the Da Paolo group. He started off at PasarBella selling Caribbean fare (which he still does). After taking over the neighbouring stall (now renamed Tapas 3) he branched out into tapas, which he has since given up for salads and Mexican fast food. While there are vegetarian options, Sea Salt is really for meat-lovers with a range of fairly unusual dishes. Portions are generous and $20 will comfortably feed you.There’s really nothing sub-par at Sea Salt but we all have our favourites. Top of the list would be the assorted chips that has a mix of yam, plantain and sweet potato crisps, and can accompany any of the Caribbean mains. The other sides we’d recommend are the roast potatoes and roasted roots. The lamb shank is an excellent main dish, not gamey at all, the meat perfectly spiced and falling off the bone. The pulled pork and mustard-coated roast beef are also close to perfect and some of our friends prefer one or the other to the lamb. The roast chicken gets slightly lower marks, though. Beef quesadillas are our top pick among the Mexican dishes, the tacos and nachos being average. Most dishes come with great nachos, besides sour cream and guacamole. The salads are fine, though none of them are memorable, and the Mexican soft drink Jarritos is an acquired taste – recommended only if you want a local drink with your meal.This review is a melange of several visits over the past two months

First time trying out this stall, ordered roast pork knuckle @ $24 per portion. Meat not too dry and skin pretty crispy and tasty, thought will come back again and I actually list them in my future party list. But the disappointment came when i approach the stall for a take away box since i can't finish the food, this plump Malay guy that stand behind the bar threw a box on the table! Then I ask him for a carrier, again he wasn't very happy and pass me a carrier as thou I am begging for it. It was a unpleasant dinner here and my mood was affected due to this guy poor attitude. I will definitely not come back here again.

Wow, this place serves excellent roast meat, but the pork knuckle is incredible. I ordered a plate and was amazed when they took a whole knuckle and sliced it onto my plate. Served with rice or roasted vegetables, this makes for an excellent version of a Sunday roast dinner for $20. Only one criticism......too much food

By the long snaking queue, you know the food is great. A 3 meat portion is enough for two person to share and enjoy the flavourful pull pork, mustard seed roast beef and chicken! If you are in for something fried, then the fish and chips are to die for. The pork knuckles would be perfect to go with the wine or beer you can get nearby.The portions are generous and the chef is passionate. Thats why I go back weeks after weeks.Try the soup too! Its fantastic
