Back again with friends for more. There is this promotion going on for every Tuesday lunch when the fish head price is reduced. The food is good and consistent in quality. Keep it up!

I love almost all dishes at Karu's. Fish head curry is awesome. We had visited Karu's for dining in and also take away. Their service is superb!

Delicious banana leaf Indian food, so many varieties! Friendly and fast service. The restaurant is huge and can be crowded at times.The place is neat and clean too.To be the food is not spicy enough. Other than that i have no other qualms!

Good service even on days when they are busy. The boss is always around to make sure that everything goes well. Reasonably priced with consistent food standard. Place is a little bit obscure but just make your way up to the 5th level and you will find the place around the corner. Recommended to book in advance if you are coming in a big group during lunch or dinner hours

Let's face it, Singapore is an expensive place to eat out in. Not if you come here! It's an unappealing venue, but don't let that put you off. If you like authentic, well spiced Indian food, then you should come here. The portions were generous and it was, by far, the cheapest meal I had during my stay. They don't sell alcohol though. So no beer with your curry
4
It's the first time that I visited them at their new location. The food was delicious. We ordered different dishes together with the banana leaf and all tasted nice. I especially liked the big prawns, dry mutton and the briyani rice.The location is not exactly easy to find on the fifth floor, but the restaurant was almost full during lunch when we visited, which is definitely a good indicator for it's quality

This restuarant is famous for it's curry fish head. We arrived at 11.00 am and most tables already had a Reserve sign. If u come in a big group, it's adviseable to make a booking. The place is spacious, clean and very comfortable. The waiters are ever ready to serve you. You have a choice of plain rice or briyani rice, up to you how much rice. If you love Indian food, this is the plac

This is one of the best curry fish head around. The spices do not overwhelm and the curry is just right. The Fish head is generously big and the price is affordable. Free flow of rice, papadam and vegetable. The mango lasi is a must try too
4
The new location is at a roof top, beside a street soccer pitch. It has better lighting, cleaner and spacious. Food wise maintain the same if not better. My favorite chicken masala, spicy fried boneless fish, curry mutton cube, mushroom manchurian add with the crispy appalam, and the pure lassi, made a full and satisfied Saturday afternoon meal

My favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore ! I have my lunch for once or twice almost weekly. You can try their boneless fried fish chunks with additional of Masala (available for chicken, shrimp etc.) on top of it, yummy ! Not forgetting the free flow of Papad, vegetables (2 varieties) and Biryani rice, eat until you drop if you want to..... Get yourself refresh by a cup of Teh Tarik (tea with milk). As I said, you will feel good and full when leaving the restaurant just by spending about $11

~easy parking, MRT, cab, bus every transportation mode is available at the building doorstep... go up to level 5 in the elevator and make 2 lefts and past the sporting areas is Karu's....~super polite young men provide fast friendly service to everyone who walks thru the doors (the right door feels stuck but really it's the wind and pressure inside that makes it hard to pull)~once inside the unmistakable Indian spices wafts past and surrounds you with their welcoming embrace~you can sit everywhere available and once it fills, you'd feel a communal Indian wedding kinda proximity to other guests~you can order at the glass counter where food is displayed or off the menu~once done they lay a treated banana leaf on your table and bring up the dals for flavor with rice pots they will scoop on your leaf... while the expectation for locals is to use your right hand to eat... there are forks and spoons available~we ordered a small fish head curry which came Large and 4 smaller dishes which came in a single serving bowl (looks to feed 1/2 an adult)chicken mysore - YUMzchicken 65 - YUMz x2boneless fish - a bit too coldprawn fried - a tad less freshI had biryani rice which was very lite and although the food was sufficient for us, except for the fish head curry we were left wanting more :) it was super crowded when we left

We have been patrons of Karu's and this was our first time to the Sime Darby outlet. It was bigger than their previous premises and suitable for gatherings and functions. Their signature dish is definitely their fish head curry. I love my curry to be not so spicy, yet full of spices with a tinge of tanginess. Their curry had the perfect balance of all that I look for in a curry. It is so good that you can just dip their Papadom into the gravy and you can never get enough. Once you start, you cannot stop!
5
Went there for lunch and it was one of the best Indian food that I have tasted in Singapore. The basmati rice is cook till fragrant and soft, the spices of the curry gravy was so aromatic. Ordered a fried mutton dish, curry squid, potato cutlet and a sambal fish for 2pax. All were superb. Togather with free flow of rice and 2 free flow side veg dishes , 2 lime juices and 2 masala tea came up to about $38. Which is reasonable for the quality of food served. Saw a lot of ppl ordered fish head curry and so wanted to order however there were only 2 of us and we reckon we couldn't finish so had to give it a pass today. The restaurant is clean and servers were very efficient. There were ample parking at the location for those who drives. Overall will recommend and visit again.

This place situated on the 5th floor at Sime Darby Center is not known to the public but they do serve good food and at affordable prices.Their curry fish head is excellent. The parpadum served is fresh and crispy. The drinks served are of excellent taste and quality like the teh ahlia (Ginger tea).All food is served on a banana leaf where the waiter will come by and place the basmarti rice and all the relevant toppings for you. You can choose to eat by hand or with the utensils provided.Overall, its a good place to eat and the taste of the food is excellent though the service and attention of the staff can be improved further

Karus signature dish is their fish curry and sambal.. Can be really excellent. Has a good variety of meat dishes and quality is good..Great for a lunch out or dinner.. Exceptional service. Thumps up for tha.Location is very convenient. Just outside the King Albert Park MRT. So easy for a good meal out ..For the fish dish will grade it Very Good.Only area for improvement will be to be consistent on food quality as sometimes noticed the dishes can be a bit off the mark.... Overall would grade it Good.

Had dinner with family here. Ordered the curry fish head, chicken marsala, fish cutlets & briyani rice. Fish head - definitely one of the best in Singapore! Great flavours and very very fresh. Chicken Marsala - good but I prefer the one at Samy's. Cutlets - very nice & flavourful. Overall, very good dinner with excellent service. Good job guys

We had lunch in this restaurant. We had their fish head curry, mutton peratal, fried fish and chicken peratal. My sister in law recommended this restaurant as I was always partial to the popular indian restaurant in race Course Road. I was pleasantly suprised with the high quality food that was served. The reviews about the Fish Head Curry is spot on. simply delicious. the right ingredients and very fresh fish head. Though I found the fried fish a bit too thick a cut nevertheless it was good on taste. the meat dishes too was excellent.What made lunch even more special was the wait staff, a Chinese waiter (did not ask his name) This elderly gentleman is a benchmark for restaurant service. gave us some recommendations and service was par excellence. It was in the little chit chat that he had with us that made lunch special. Price very reasonableWill be heading to Karu's for sure in my next trip to Singapore
4
We ordered their curry fish head, chicken Mysore and briyani. Fish head curry was very fresh and cooked to perfection. The curry was well-spiced without being too fiery. Chicken Mysore was good but I guess they must have cooked it in advance thus the "dryness". Quality and flavor were good though. Looking forward to their new premises as I heard it is much larger and easier with parking.

Unlike the popular banana leaf restaurants in little India area for tourists, this restaurant is famous with the locals Singaporean mainly because of its taste n price. For the taste and flavor it does not have a strong taste of spices yet you can still taste them at the right amount. On top of these the service is good and very attentive to the dinners. Very friendly crew and their excellent service makes you feel as if you are taking a meal at your friend place. That is till you have to make the payment. But as I mentioned the price is reasonable for the curry fish head. I am not sure about the crab as we never tried it. You will most likely visit it again once you have tried it.

Firstly, Karu's Curry has MOVED to: 896 DUNEARN ROAD, #5-01 SIME DARBY CENTRE, 589472. It is right in front of the King Albert Park MRT station - cross the overhead bridge and it's on the 5th floor above TOTT'S.The food is wholesome, authentic and very reasonably priced. I usually go for the Briyani rice, chicken masala, mutton mysore and mutton curry. The vegetable condiments are great as well. The fish head curry (Indian style) is also very good.Most importantly - Karu's is clean and neat. And it's reasonably priced.Make sure you go early: 11:30am for lunch and 6pm for dinner... seating is ample but there's always a crowd! Parking is FREE on weekends - big PLUS!I usually take away or take out... and there is a separate queue for take-aways... be patient and make sure the staff get your attention

They have the best coffee and rasam there. Though there touch of directions to the place but I'm for sure you won't lose your way.
5
for me this is one of the best places to have south indian food and non veg fish curry the price log is quite fine and you will feel to join again

Once of the best Indian restaurant in singapore's west region, average price and good service. Fish head curry and prawns fry are the best!

Karu’s has been around at the Bukit Gombak area in Upper Bukit Timah Road for many years until just under two months ago, in August 2016, they moved into their current location at 896 Dunearn Road, #05-01 Sime Darby Centre. Even before this time, they have been well known for their South Indian Banana Leaf food, especially for their fish head curry, and curry fans have travelled the course of the PIE from the East to get to the West for a meal of this dish.The Restaurant is situated on the top floor of the building, with a large glass wall panel to view the greenery on your left as you enter. There’s ample paid parking at the Sime Darby Centre.The ambiance is pretty plain, and the only decorative items are on the wall behind the cashier’s counter. The cooked food is encased behind glass counters and you need to select your dishes before sitting. Instead of plates, fresh banana leaves are placed before you and depending on what you wanted, briyani or white rice is placed on this, together with some vegetables. Amongst the favorites are the Fish Head curry, the Masala crabs and prawns. For the Masala Chicken and most other dishes, a serving would cost around $5.40. The food is tasty, though some may find the Masala chicken a little spicy. You can ask for as much rice, papadams and veg as you want. Service can be very good to not so good, depending on when you come. I found it hard initially to get their attention, but when I did, it was alright.Prices are reasonable and it’s good value for your buck, which includes gst but no Service charge. We had a take away Chicken meal for two, and the amount of food we got was sufficient to feed four people! Each Chicken meal was $8.60 and this included the papadams and two side vegetables plus a huge bag of gravy.The Restaurant is good for lunch, dinner, afterwork dining, and for family gatherings, parties in large groups, etc. They do catering, take aways and home deliveries as well. Getting there is not difficult as the MRT station is just outside the building and the bus stop close by. Certainly a competitor for Samy’s Curry at Dempsey, as the menu appears very similar except for some items which look additional, eg. pepper chicken, fish Manchurian and fish roe, to mention a few. Also popular are the lime juice and the masala tea. I would certainly go back to try the Fish head curry and a few more of their popular dishes.Their New Address at Dunearn Road is: 896 Dunearn Road, #05-01 Sime Darby Centre, Singapore 589472. Tel:67627284

Karu's is nothing flash. It's on the top floor of a shopping and office centre but they have got it just right. Food is delicious, staff are super friendly and welcoming and it's the kind of place that you want to go back to. It's also the kind of place where you want to tip because they have given good service as opposed to because tipping is just what you do. The prices are very reasonable. What's not to like.

Love the food and the experience at Karu's. You get both an authentic indian food, but also an authentic banana leaf restaurant experience there. Whenever I have friends in town from overseas (or even friends who've yet to come to this side of the island), Karu's is one of those options to dine at. Your Karu's experience begins with a banana leaf placed in front of you. Some of their staff will then come by with a choice of rice, vegetables as well as papadums. You have to order the main dish from them. I usually go for the Curry fish head, especially if I'm in a group, or the Chicken Masala. The food is really great tasting and the items, like the rice, vegetables and papadums, are free flow. Price is very affordable and good value. I recommend coming early to avoid the crowds, or coming after the peak hours. Good for smaller groups

The meal begins with the laying out of banana leaves, then chose white/bryani rice, type of gravy, 2 pampadums soon follow. (top ups are free). Proceed to the food warmer and select your condiments for meat/vegetables. I found that a single choice of meat was adequate. The tea is simply delicious and aromatic. About $12/pax. They will be shifting soon (August 2016) to Sime Darby Centre, 896 Dunearn Road 589472. A larger premises with more than ample parking. Dining here for me is like a magical journey to traditional India, where authentic chefs don't cut corners for ingredients, preparation or service. I'm amazed that they don't charge more

My favourite place for lunch with my colleagues and friends. Meal is served in banana leaf which simply enhances the flavour and the taste. My all time favourite is fish head curry, which I think is one of the best in the island. Chicken masala and Mysore mutton are my other staples. I would love to have a glass of iced butter milk for a great combo

Love the food here. Fix our indian food cravings at least once a month. Price is affordable and plenty of seats here. Fully airconditioned but will leave the smell stained to our clothes after eating, which i don't really mind! Quite a handful of items on the menu, we usually go for rice with meat variations. Good for lunch and dinner. Conveniently near the bustop and about 100-200m away from LRT/MRT. The fish head curry deserves more than two thumbs up! Check out the huge prawns too!Do take note they will be relocating to Sime Darby in August. Still near the MRT, will definitely be there

Brrrrp!!! Just had my Indian good fix . Still a great place for your banana leaf meal . Staff is friendly ... But you may have to remind them a few times on your orders . Anyway for the price you pay that's ok .. Just remind them about your orders

We went there today for dinner. Ordered the fish head curry, chicken masala and fried chicken.
The order came swiftly and the fish head curry never fails! It's a definitely a must go place if you have any cravings for curry!

My favorite banana leaf restaurant in Singapore, located in upper Bukit timah road near to Bukit panjang mrt station. Favorite dishes are fried fish egg, curry sotong, curry chicken gravy, dry mutton curry, curry fish head etc.

Met a group of friends for dinner at Karu's on a weekday night. We were seated immediately. Service as usual was fuss-free, immediate and efficient. The food is, as always, predictably good. The fish head curry is as good as it gets, always. Best of all, their prices are reasonable. Though there are other fish head curry restaurants closer to our home, we prefer to drive to Karu's at Upper Bukit Timah because we always know what to expect

I learnt about this restaurant some weeks ago and it has been on my must-try list since.I met up with a friend for lunch and recommended we try this place, which he agreed, as he too has not tried it. We reached at 11am and the restaurant had only a few customers and we could pick where we wanted to sit.We ordered the following items: - Vegetable biryani appalam: $3.40 each. Plain biryani rice served on a banana leaf. Great with the curries and chicken masala.- Fish Head: $22. Small fish head, good for 2 pax. Curry is tasty and good amount of fish meat for 2.- Chicken Masala: $5. Spicy. But it hits the mark!- Fresh Lime Juice: $2.40 each. Nice and refreshing. - Tiger Beer: $5 each. This was on draught. Fresh taste and pairs well with the meal.- Masala Tea: $2.50 each. To end the meal, we had to have this. Good taste. I spent a total of $57.Food quality is good, but do remember that the prices here are before GST, which is added to your bill at the end of your meal

No question again and again, my family has found Karu to be the single best offering of Fishhead curry in Singapore. They come in different sizes, you could order yellow rice, and naan with it. Usually we take an order of Chicken Masala rather than the tandoori because we prefer it moist. When we can, we eat there because it is old school Banana leaf service - you sit down and they give you a banana leaf. Then food come in tin cans they dish out of except the fish head. If you are adventurous try eating with your hands like the Indians, the bulk of their patrons, do. It is more flavourful because you FEEL the texture of the food instead of the much diminished sensation of the cutlery. This place is opposite the Bukit Gombak Defence ministry HQ right along a row of shop houses that sell tyres and nick nacks. No, you are not looking for anywhere fancy but that's part of the allure

The location is a bit out of the way but very handy if you are living nearby, and cheaper than the city centre restaurants with grander decor.If you are a tourist on a budget you will love the 'authentic' banana leaf experience, of food served onto a green banana leaf the size of a tray. The rice and veg are ladled out automatically.The fish head curry, a Singaporean speciality, comes in a big bowl and those who like it were happy. I had Masala Dosai (potato pancake) which was good. I also chose chicken liver, rare to find, not always available says the menu. Chicken liver great, chewy kidney? not so great.What's not to like? Dull decor. No desserts visible here nor nearby. Bowl of something or other in plain beige colour by counter where you pay but I wasn't asked to try.What's to like? Great value. About Â£7 English pounds each including a soft drink.Service smiling and prompt. Good choice of drinks: lassi; and a rose concoction (milk? - I forget), and coconut juice.Great value home cooking.They serve breakfast from 10 am

We visit this place often. Location wise, a bit far from the main buzz. Always busy. Best dishes include fish head n chicken masala, mysore chicken , mysore mutton. They taste like the authentic indian ones which very few places in singapore offer. Minus part, the vegetarian curries are mostly the same everyday, cabbage n some gourd. They rarely change. The biriyani meal is nothing but colored basmati rice which is very bland , instead of the white rice given with normal meal. Don't expect that spicy biriyani with veggies or chicken pieces you see in those other indian restaurants. Tiffins would be south indian only, like idli, dosa and the prata. Price is pretty reasonable n do note that it's closed on Mondays

We went to Karu's last weekend when visiting a "local". Location to their home was great (just around the corner), but if you are staying in the main parts of Singapore tourist areas (Orchard Road, Marina, Little India etc) this place will be a hike. Perhaps wait until the blue Downtown MRT line is extended to here in a couple of months.Food was cheap and delicious (but we did have the Dosai rather than the banana leaf), and the service was quick. It was very busy too which is always a good sign.If you are going for banana leaf, take plenty of friends as the servings looked huge!
5
It's located at upper Bukit timah road, to me it's the best banana leaf Indian rice in the city. My favorite dishes are curry sotong (squid), fried fish roe, fried fish fillets, dry curry chicken, curry mutton and curry fish head. I will usually have a lime juice and a Teh Tarik tea after my meal. The sides such as the cracker and cabbage is really good too. I will opt for curry chicken gravy. Highly recommended
5
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore, very basic and nothing pretentious about it..in fact it is a bit out of the way on Upper Bukit Timah Road but you must locate it and go there to have one of your best ever South India meals...try the crab, fish, chicken, mutton, anything...and you won't be disappointed.
