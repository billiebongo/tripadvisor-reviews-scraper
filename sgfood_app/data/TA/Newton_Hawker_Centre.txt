Friends from Singapore took us here for dinner one evening, WOW are we glad they did. What an exciting, vibrant place to eat. So many choices and variety and all very well priced. Even the beer is cheap. Absolutely a must do when visiting Singapore
4
We where there with 5 people enjoying food from different stalls. It's a Asian style environment but still focused on foreign tourist.
The food was super
4
Thumbs up!! Prices are very reasonable. Be prepared to share tables since always crowded. One downside is when having to sit in between very loud boisterous dinner groups.

I've been to this place many times. I think tourist have to choose the good seller than the bad one in here. I always come to the lady that have shop in the middle of the hawker at the right end (forgot the hawker number). Her menu for the crab has a price also for small, medium or large so it's a fixed price. She always give me a small price for a medium crab. I paid S$ 42 for a medium black pepper crab which is quite good. The taste is delicious as well
1
It's one of those places you feel you should go but it's expensive and they load the prices for tourists, only ever go for fixed prices and avoid the ones marked that you pay by weight as they always add S$20 on the price. Meal was very average to be honest
2
Honestly, average quality food here. Or I should say in general Singapore local dishes is not that good. If you been to northern Malaysia, that will be a real deal.Expensive, tasteless, dont have any distinctive characteris in the food. Well, if you dont mind the above, please visit then.
3
A local friend brought us here for a midnight snack, and it was fun with a lively atmosphere. I stuck to the "carrot cake" as it seemed a safe option, and it was actually really tasty (I will try to make it at home now I think). My boyfriend ate loads of things, BBQ stingray amongst others, and he raved about it although the day after he really suffered with a bad stomach upset, he thinks it was the mutton soup but it's hard to say as we were eating out lots and he eats seafood wherever he goes. So I would say eat here as a thing to tick off the list but choose wisely

This Centre is a few minutes walk from the Newton MRT station. We found the food fresh, tasty and very good value. We explained that our Coeliac son had to have gluten free food and the lady sourced dishes from a few stalls for him. Cheapest meal we had in Singapore
2
 i was looking forward to taking my wife to a hawker centre to try some great food including the chilli crab, now it is only a hawker centre but my previous experience in singapore is that they have been very good , I checked this place out on trip adviser and took the MRT to get there. Arrived , all good , busy and a good vibe however the food was not good in fact it was far from good . perhaps we were unlucky with our choice . However i would suggest that unless you have been recommended a place at the centre, really donâ€™t care or happy to just risk it i would think carefully about this centre - there are other choices .If you decide to go i hope that you have a better food experience.

Dropped in for dinner the other night. Fantastic selection of food to suit most tastes. Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. Soft shell crab was great. Selection of Indian curries was awesome. Dumplings were delicious. Prices were reasonable for both food a drinks. Can be a little overwhelming on arrival as stall holders bid for your business. Recommend a visit
4
Nice food. Too less variety. Most of the are selling the same food. Fried oyster omelette and Satay from stall 73 and stall 76 meat try.
4
Newtons hawker center hasn't changed much in the past 20years.. the food quality is very good and there are plenty of options to choose from.. since most of the seating is outdoor / it can be inconvenient when it rains.. will be back some day..
5
If you want real food, authenticity and local produce without the frills then this is the place. We loved it, went everyday once we discovered it. Please note, it’s cheap and is not at all flash so if you like silver service, this is NOT for you. The food however is fresh and delicious. $10 will get you just about anything and a large beer will set you back $5. Refreshingly affordable and authentic
4
Took the family (some hadn't been here before) for dinner with a difference. The food was as good as it has been in the past, fast service, great selection at very reasonable prices.Not quite as charming as it was years ago but all very neat, tidy and clean.The grand-children enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food. I enjoyed the food and the cold beers!As in the past this will always be a place I visit when in Singapore
3
Tried a few stalls and the food was very mediocre. Had the curried skate wings which were the best of the variety of items we ordered. Certainly not the Singapore hawker food of past. This is OK for a visit if you want to say you tried a hawker center but not a must visit
4
As this is a hawker center, we ordered different kinds of food to try and share amongst ourselves.We had satay, grilled chicken wings, fishball noodles and reddish cake. The food was delicious and nice to be shared. We washed down our food with Tiger beer, which made our experience very enjoyable.Do sit in the open air section in the middle, as it gets quite stuffy under the shelter
4
This was my second visit, we visited a few years before and I was not ready for all the sprooking which at first put me off. Visiting again and being prepared for all the sprooking this time I enjoyed the experience a lot more. The place is very busy due to popularity, a lot of locals eat here too, not just tourists. There is so much to choose from and the food is absolutely delicious. Have to have some satay and watermelon juice
5
If you are a tourist, expatriate working here or a Sporean, Newton HC is the place to visit for a great night with friends. It had its ugly past from a few black sheeps touting food in the competitive environment but what Spore food you need to try out is here. Not the top in each category, but the variety is good enough. Bad food will self eliminate the stalls anyway... my personal preference- braised duck meat, oyster omelette, rojak, satay, fish ball soup, and of course of the bbq stingrays, crayfish etc. No specifix stalls for mention. Beside Newton MRT statio
5
Alliance seafood’s Singapore chilli crab is mentioned in the Singapore Michelin guide and as expected it’s faultless. The Sri Lankan crabs are fresh, juicy and tender and the sweet and tangy sauce has the right level of heat. The fried mantou (buns) are the best to soak it up with. They go that little bit extra and provide plastic gloves and napkins. Look for stand 27.
3
Went with a local who eats there alot. Mixture of locals and tourists. Large open area with tables. Tables also available along the edges next to the stalls. Try to get a table in the open area as it's less stuffy. Have someone save your table as you browse all the food stalls and then switch. Lots of options, though most offer the same fare. Prices are reasonable but I wasn't that impressed by the quality of the food. Make sure you bring your own tissues/napkins as they are not offered there
4
Newton can be over hypped but there is good food to be found. I am a local and I would eat there.. So enjoy the satay, popiah, malay rice esp the corner stall, thai all good.
4
We had one of the best lobster meals ever!!! Black pepper lobster, you get to choose the lobster and pay by the 100g. Excellent food.
There is dozens of food shops with dining tables outside under the fans. So much to choose from.
5
Having been warned by a friendly taxi driver to agree prices before we placed the order, we braved a visit here. The result was one of the best meals - Chilli Crab of course. We were lucky to pick The Ocean BBQ ( stall 16) run by a gentleman by the name of Dino Marn. And so glad we did. All up including the taxi it cost us $100 for 2 including drinks. Well worth it
4
Newton Hawker Centre was recommended and the Singapore Chilli Crab as the dish you should try. Well the place has a lot of budget meals and eateries, but the hawkers do not relent, you want to look at a menu and prices and they want to sit you down and shove a meal in front of you. Found a place for chilli Crab, most places charge $5 per 100gram of crab weight. Advice is to see Crab and get an estimate of weight and cost before you order, we did about face and paid the price. The meal was very good, did not have to wait long. After our meal we got our bill and to our surprise it was not what we expected. the Crab was nowhere near half a kilo let alone we paid for over a kilo. There is a large selection of meals and they start around $4, select a couple of dishes and you have a good meal. A wide variety Indian, Malay, chinese and Singaporean. Alcohol is also available
5
This is the best hawker center on singapore. On advice i went to two other hawker centers and was sadly disappointed. Newton is definitely has the best to offer. Its very clean and has excellent stalls to choose from. Number 31 heng heng bbq has excellent food
2
For tourists, take my advice, do NOT visit Newton Hawker Centre in Singapore. Because there are mamy tourists visit this centre, the hawker will tend to charge you at a sky-rocket price (especially the seafood stalls) than the local. If you are not aware, they may charge you $100- $120 per king prawn. If you really want to eat here, ask for the final price first before they cook.The taste of food here is of average standard. I personally prefer other hawker centres like Maxwell Hawker Ctr (they serve mainly lunch, no dinner)
5
Newton Hawker Centre is a buzzing place with incredible food and a fantastic vibe. We tried so many food options and everything was amazing.....not to mention very affordable in what is an expensive city with cheap food and really good drinks options and prices (hello, $39 for a bucket of 6 coronas). Highly recommend
3
We were jet lagged and needed a simple meal close to our hotel so ended up here. There are other hawker centres that are better, but we were all able to find something we wanted to try and enjoyed what we ate and drank. Place was clean with lots of staff clearing tables etc
2
Great food but really, what a rip off. Go to Whampoa Hawker once, and this place will feel like you're paying like a Michelin Star restaurant in London. This place is purely for tourists who want to say they've eaten like the Singaporeans do. It's probably 3 x more expensive than it should be. No Singaporeans eat here
4
Went recently, food was great. Ordered the standard sugar cane juice, sting ray, satay and rojak. All are a must try. Food are reasonably priced.Ambience however was not my favourite. Hot and stuffy, filled with smoke and grease. Some touting, but they leave you to be if you are not interested. Must go if you stay at Sheraton hotel as it is walking distance
4
We have eaten here quite a lot. First time we have eaten the Chili Crab, my wife says its great, my satay sticks were a bit fatty but not bad.
4
Love this hawker centre!! I live near Orchard road and it's the closest. Good food and beer! Prices are very reasonable!
5
I have been visiting Newton Circuss Hawker center since 30 years ago. Convenient - MRT (Metro) station across the street. A short walk (10 mins) form bussy commercial district of Orchard Road.Dozens of food kiosks and stalls with tasty and delicious local meals prepared on the spot. fast food, NO JUNK food.It can be crowdy... anytime. specially at conventional dinner times. Id that is the case... just be patient and be fast to grab a table. or just look around to make your mind on wtah to eat.. and take out or eat on the go.It is open air. No air Con. it is pÃ rt of the experience.Hygiene standards high and above average in asian street foof (a big ++ for westerns sensitive guts)The biggest challenge.... to decide what to eat with such temting array os scents and flavours ... and all the owners "self-promoting" as the best among the rest. Tough choices
4
The place is always busy, but well organise as its got nice ambiance, clean, safe, friendly mamas & uncles offering you some different cuisine, though a bit pricey, but the price pays all those above. Mostly seafood, local Malaysian or Indonesian, Indian and Thai are available. Just that this time we were a bit disappointed as we ordered few different dish, most of the dish arrived quickly, but the main dish for our children came way too late while the first dish all were almost finish for us adult ... We had to get up twice reminding the stall to get food out. We ll go to another stalls next time ..
4
When it was too late to go anywhere for dinner, the concierge at our hotel suggested that we go to Newton Hawker Centre for a bite. The place was super crowded even after 11 pm, and everybody there seemed to be enjoying a hearty, and by the looks of it, exotic, meal. We stuck to our favorites, kungpao chicken and fried rice, with pork dumplings on the side. It was quite a satisfying meal, and didn't cost too much too
4
This is a popular Hawker center both among locals and visitors. There are dozens of food stalls selling all kinds of things. Seafood is very popular here. I tried the singapore chilli jumbo crab and Bun and it was fantastic. However the price is not transparent in the sense that the stalls don't show you the weight of the fish or prawn they cook. But worth visiting of course
4
Ordered a stingray about 4 weeks ago at this store. Turned out to be tough and dry. Upon telling the store the inedible dish, the store assistant offered me a different dish free of charge. However at that time I had ordered a similar dish from an adjacent store so I declined. To my pleasant surprise, Alliance promptly refunded the dish in FULL. As a local Singapore which had eaten at numerous hawker centers, I had never experienced a full refund, bar none, no matter how bad the food was. Well done Alliance! Am coming back to try your other dishes as I know I will be eating in peace
5
My favorite food in Newton food center is BBQ stingray. Portion is pretty big and very cheap! Highly recommend chili crab as well(we chose #27 stand) if you don't wanna spend over S$100 in Jumbo. We had a small size of fried rice and chili crab and it was S$40 nett.
4
It's definitely a place for food, a lot of repetition food stall, so just follow your guts and choose one stall. Foods are amazing, price slightly above average and is always packed with people. But don't miss it out. Go and sqeat yourself then order something cold to chill down
4
Arrived just after 6pm. While the whole place was very busy, we found a table ok. The lady with the shop nearest the table was over in a flash, with photos on a menu board and asking what we would like. It turned out that she organised drinks (from another nearby vendor) and our two meals, which happened to be from a third vendor. Excellent service and very cheap. So good for local street food that we went back a second night and wull most likely go back again before we leave
3
Food is fresh and cooked good.
Prices are above average.
No smoking.
Beer is available.
Taxi are difficult to get after 8pm.
Mrt nearby.
Clean toilets.
Generally its okie.
5
Too many choice, for stringray grill the best is stall no 61.
Special singapore food is popiah, carrot cake.
Newtoon Hawker Centre is good for hunting food.
Nice food place on Singapore
4
Must try hawker food in Singapore. Humble atmosphere, good food (ordered chili crab with mantau, garlic prawns, grilled stingray, etc), all delicious. But a bit more expensive than expected.
4
Always a great place to visit with friends for tasty food accompanied by jugs of ice cold tiger beer. Cheap, cheerful and tasty .. recommend giving it a go...
4
This is the place to go for a group where you can all choose your individual favourites. There are many many small outlets all servicing different cuisines, from Indian, to Indonesian, to Chinese and many more. It is cheap and very good fun. You can choose what you want and then all sit together at the outside tables in the middle and mix and match
4
Overwhelming choices of food :-). I am sure each stall has nice food.Especially good was the satay with the peanut sauce. We got them from a stall on the very first row. Open atmosphere, good for evening but might be too hot for a sunny day. Only limited covered places available when raining
5
What a hilarious experience! I had been told I had to have Chilli Mud Crab whilst in Singapore and one of the Taxi drivers I had (taxis are great and cheap) suggested that this was the place to go. I walked from Pan Pacific Orchard on a pleasant evening and duly ordered. So much food and so much mess eating it but it was delicious. Stall holders took great delight in telling to "not be neat and use your hands" and provided me with many additional napkins to help with the clean-up. there were dozens of stall selling an wide variety of food from the very cheap chicken rice through to the mud crabs which was a once in a visit experience. Definitely worth going to.
4
Lots of choices mainly seafood prepared dozens of ways, with other usual hawker delights - satay, curries, kway teow, mee goreng, poh piah, duck noodle, oyster omelete and so much more. Reasonably priced given its a hawker center. Aside from the usual drink vendors, there's interesting beer on tap stall inside the triangle farthest from the two entry points.
5
I genuinely think Newton Hawker Center is better than Lau pa Sat. Environment is better and the sellers aren't as pushy as the ones in Lau pa Sat! And it closes at 2am on weekends I believe! If you are going on Friday evening then consider go a bit early like 6-7ish so you can grab seats for you and friends or family, before eveyone else starts to show up.
5
Such an enjoyable dining experience in Singapore. Something different than the overpriced and boring food found in the shopping areas.I've heard that tourists get a different price to locals. But the price is so good that it didn't worry us.And they have beer towers!!
5
Stall 29 offered nice cold drinks and super chilled beers. Linda never fails to make you feel welcomed and homely. Great fresh seafood offered at other stalls, when the time of your visit is right.
4
Great atmosphere and endless selection of cuisines . Easy to get to. Full of locals
A bit more expensive than expected
4
Still a place for tourists. Mostly seafood stalls. Quite difficult to find place to sit unless you order food from that particular stall, the stall people will help you find a place.
5
You can't come to Singapore without trying the authentic Hawker centre where so many locals eat. The choice of food and freshness is amazing and unbelievably cheap for the amount and quality. Girly recommend this place. Loved it!!!
4
Atmosphere great, buzzing with happy eaters. The food offered is predominately seafood but good and varied. A little pricey.
5
I was brought here by a family member when i visited Singapore back in April. By the time i visited this one, we already ate at a few other food centers. I think after Lau Pa Sat this was my favorite of them. I let the host order most of the food so im not exactly sure where the food we had ordered came from but it was all so good. We came for dinner and the place was quite crowded but we were able to get a table under the overhang. We were looking for a table out in the open but they were all taken already. Noteable foods we had here, roast duck, char kway kway, baby gai lan, oyster omelette. I enjoyed everything here and thinking about the food is making my mouth water
4
This famous food centre has been around for many years but it is still able to retain its popularity with locals and tourists. There is a good variety of food , most of which are typically Singapore. Local food like satay, oyster omelet , several kinds of noodles ( wanton/roast pork, fishball, minced pork etc), seafood (famous chilli crab, stingray etc) was of a high standard . For thirst-quenching drinks the variety was also good , such as fresh sugar cane juice, fruit juices , local Tiger beer etc. The centre is easily accessible by public transport and is on the Newton MRT stop . The place consists of a covered part next to the stalls and a big middle uncovered part. If it rains , this can be a problem . All in all a very good place to savour the culinary delights of street ( and other ) foods of Singapore.
4
The satay has always been good at Newton over the many years I have been visiting Singapore. It's the reason I visit Newton. It's still as good as always, and we also really enjoyed the fried rice. Great atmosphere and plenty of choice - a must when visiting Singapore. I've only taken off one point because it's not that cheap anymore and the touting can be a bit annoying, although that has improved greatly over the years
5
Wow. You can find anything you want to eat at the Newton Hawker Centre which is also a favorite with the locals for authentic local food. There are so many places to choose from and each one specializes in a different type of food.You just sit down anywhere there is room so be aware that you might be sharing your table with someone else but this is a great way to talk with other people. Each table has a number on it' so when you have walked around to see what you want to eat, you place your order and give them your table number and they will bring you your food.I started with some very cold beer because of the heat and then went on to some delicious stay sticks with a very nutty sauce which I loved. I then had fresh prawns with garlic butter and they were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.The Newton Hawker Centre is right beside the Newton MRT station so it very easy to get there and a two minute walk across the walkway to get there from the station.While you are there you can try some Durian fruit; often called the smelliest fruit in the world. It tastes quite nice but you do have to get past the smell.One tip: I found that the undercover area beside the cooking stalls was quite hot even though there are ceiling fans so I shifted to the open area in the middle of the center of the area which was much cooler
4
Given it's located close to the hotel-rich area of Orchard road, the Newton Hawker centre is one of the most famous and well tourist-ed of the hawker centers of Singapore. It is a large open air dining area with basic seats and tables. There are certainly plenty of food options but the prices are significantly higher than what you would expect for a hawker center. Vendors will approach you in an attempt to sell their wares - although unlike other SE asian hawkers, they were honest and open about the product and price. As a rough guide - small chilli crabs are about 35SD, Beers 7SD (for 667ml Tiger), Small squid entrees about 12SD. There is a number of juices and sugar cane options available.Overall this was a good option in terms of food variety, taste and quality but it wasn't cheap for the standard of dining
5
Whether you want a fresh green coconut, sugar cane drink or some chilli crab this is the place to come!
4
Their Black pepper crab n cereal prawns is wonderfully delicious
Kang Kong with garlic n baby squid to company
5
Chilli crab here was one of my favorite meal in Asia over 10 years , someone else recommended the stall 31 on here and i agree with them , it was great ]
The rest of the market was a great atmosphere too
3
It is always packed whenever we go there. It is hit and miss with the stalls - we normally find an Indian stall and it is usually pretty good. Watch out for the rip offs but it is one of the iconic places in Singapore.
5
This centre serves lots of the Singapore local authentic food and they are not too expensive. Most tables are in the open space and they are always filled with the locals. I went there twice with my family to eat and ordered many dishes to share. Try their satay, fish soup, cockles, gong gong, Singapore laksa and otah! They are also famous for their chillie stingray and ask for the meaty piece so you don't get too many bones! Singapore being such a humid country, I never failed to order my favourite thirst quenching sugar cane juice straight from the presser! Love it
5
Having driven past this hawker centre literally for decades, I decided to make it my mission to visit. It was quite late in the evening, but the place was still jumping. I decided on noodles and a beer. Both were very pleasant. I will definitely be back to try more of the interesting cuisine on offer
5
Went here based on concierge recommendation. Short taxi from Orchard Road. Amazing selection of hawker street food in a large, clean and vibrant area. The place was packed on a Friday night and we waited a while for a seat. You order and give them your table number and they bring the dishes to you. Hd amazing satays from RB Express Satay (not cheap though at 70 cents SGD per satay); great prawn dumplings; beer; oyster omelette etc. Delicious! We went by taxi and left by Uber - both really easy as they can drive almost to the door. Highly recommended
3
Went for a dinner in this newly renovated hawker center in Newton. My colleague and I, ordered different dishes in one of the sea food . He ordered also satay in one of the Halal Satay stall. But lo and behold, the satay taste was disgusting. Its undercooked and taste like a raw mutton and chicken too. I spit out some of the portion and did not bother to touch others. I believe this is the worst satay i ever taste. Other dishes like the chilli crab were okay, but the bun they gave also not fully baked. I was so disappointed coming back here
4
if you don't know where to eat or what to eat. just try to go to this hawker centre. you can take mrt and alight at newton station take exit b. there was a lot of food to choice. seafood, laksa, mee, oyster, beer and etc. if you craving for seafood i thought that this place is cheaper than many restaurant. and the food was delicious. and don't forget to find your sit first, remember your seat number. order your food and mention your seat number
4
Although designed as a tourist attraction as well as a residential / office worker hawker centre it is certainly worth an evening of any Singapore visitor's itinerary. Yes, it is more expensive than pretty much any other hawker centre in the city, but it is still cheap for what you get: Usually very good, quick food across multiple cuisines: Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Thai, Indian, with lots of fruit and juice (and beer) stalls. It is always lively with a good locals/tourist mix
4
Fantastic and delicious Grill Sting Ray and Black Pepper Beef.
There are many other seafood.. Also, try to Vegetarian Rojak as it taste quite different from the black sauce.
4
Amazing Chilli Crab ;)
You can enjoy your meals here with many asian food and drinking and many tables inside.
Hawker Center with cars park and near MRT station.
4
Wow love the different options availabe to you at Newton Circua hawker food center. Anything from Mee Goreng to Chicken Satay to Teh Tarik . Food comes fast and cheap. Would recommend coming just to try all the different dishes.
4
A wonderful experience with something like 50 or 60 different food outlets to choose from surrounding a central seating area. Incredibly busy when we were there at 9:00pm but well organised and remarkably clean with a great atmosphere.
5
Highly recommended for a visit to Singapore. Excellent food, reasonably priced, and great atmosphere. Great experience of open air eating.
4
Great vibe and good food, this is worth the trip even if it was just for the experience. Don't worry about night time travel, it is safe and family friendly. Try everything if you like we had 3 different dishes from 3 different vendors and all were tasty and quickly delivered
4
This was recommended by our waiter at the cafe in the botanical gardens. It is easy to get to from the MRT line and it has fantastic options for local cuisines. The outlets are graded from A-D for their health code practices. Prices range from SD$4-10, a bit more for fresh crab and seafood. Beer and other alcoholic sodas are available here. You can even buy a carton of beer if you want. Just be sure to clean up after yourself. There are food tray trolleys scattered around for diners to place their dirty dishes on. Cleaners bus these way to be washed and distributed back to the vendors but it is not looked favorably on if you just leave them on the table. Its a good system really.Smoke only in designated smoking sites.Try as much unusual foods as you can or taste your favorites done authentically Singaporean style 
3
We hit many hawker centres across the city and this one was by far the most expensive.Our taxi driver had warned us they have had issues with ripping customers off here - I can see why. The beers and water were significantly pricier than elsewhere.The food was good but not the best we had in Singapore. It was full of locals but actually seemed the least authentic of the dozen hawker markets we visited. I say this because it was the only one that had true hawkers trying to sell us their wares. This is what made it feel as though it was staged for those looking for this experience.It seemed to mainly cater for seafood which is all well and good but for me variety truly is the spice of life. There is nowhere near the choice of the likes of Amoy Street.We ate at Alliance Seafood (in the Michelin Guide) which I cannot deny was very nice - the prawns were very tasty indeed. Shame we left Newton wishing for more
4
The real deal, as it has been for decades. Close to the city, and Newton MRT. Busy with locals and expats. What impressed me was the freshness and quality of the seafood at a range of outlets -lobster, bugs(sometimes labelled as crayfish, sometimes as lobster-we know them as Balmain Bugs), stingray, tiger prawns. Adam Liaw recommended Stall 27, and the stingray with sambal didn't disappoint. Especially with a cold bottle of Tiger
4
Convenient location in the city, good public facilities and well maintained.Great place to eat or try Singaporean dishes and a wide variety of seafood. Western food is also availableThe prices are clearly stated on the menu/board. However it's good to double check before ordering the dishes.Come early to get good seats
5
Great, clean hawker center that is easily accessible via the MRT. Great food, a little pricier than some other centers. I'd say this one is one more tourists go to.
1
Very disappointed because stall owners kept pushing menus in our faces. I will never visit this hawker centre again
5
Great food at cheap prices. definitely worth the far walk from either MRT Stations (its sort of in between 2 stations)
3
Memory lane visit - still very popular - and has a wide range of food. Tidied up since old days. Worth a visit for the feeling.
4
Red many reports about Newton but glad to say it still serves fresh good food.
Prices has gone up but Its still cheap to get good here.
5
This is a must-visit hawker center in Singapore. It's relatively cleaner than many other non-air conditioned hawker centers I have visited. To name a few, my favourites are the salad wrap facing carpark, fishballs/fish dumplings from the left (inside) corner stall and satays from Heng èˆˆ.There are many stalls selling BBQ seafood too, but be very careful when ordering crab, fish, lobsters and prawns/shrimps because these are usually charged by weight. It's recommended to find out the costs before ordering.By the way, most food here are served in disposable cutlery and utensils
3
The food is average. Prices are crazy high compared to other hawker centres. Nestled in the middle of expat hamlets and orchard road - it's a convenient hawker centre. Food is acceptable - similar to Lao pasat. Staff are not friendly.If you can I suggest chomp chomp or Adams road.
2
Visited Singapore in January 2017 and stayed at an AirBnB accommodation in Novena. Newton Circus Hawker market was about a 10-15min walk away and in the evening was a pleasant walk.On arrival at Newton Circus as you walk in there are signs which state "No Touting". From the minute we walked past that sign we were constantly harassed until we found somewhere to sit. The variety of food is not to bad but predominantly seafood but beef, chicken and pork are available if you look around. It is imperative that you confirm prices as they can suddenly change for an unsuspecting tourist. The Indian food was to die for but the rest was fairly plain and nondescript but the kids seem to like it and it was easy.The overall feel of Newton Circus was that it had had its heyday and it looked and felt old and well past its use by date and is need of a clean both in stalls and atmosphere. having spent 9 nights in Singapore we ate here twice and the second time was due to necessity and not by choice due to a long day at Legoland and the train stopped at this location. We ate at far better places including La Pau Sat and China Town
4
A quality hawker centre with plenty of variety that is close to Orchard Rd. You can get into a queue with the locals or find something yourself. Plenty of seating with fans and stalls with cold drinks and beer. Dishes with duck, chicken rice, Indian, satay's etc available. All priced around $4-5 SGD. Great value
5
Oh my oh my ! its been almost a decade since I gone to Newton Hawker Center. Now its new , clean and spacious. Prices use to be extremely steep with stalls cheating out prices but not anymore . Price are pretty standard then outside hawker stalls no just expect slightly bit more.
5
Best place for a famous hawker market meal in Singapore - its clean and comfortable and the food is of an excellent quality for the standard - you will not be disappointed and will leave full and happy!

A short distance walk from our hotel at Grand Hyatt. Wide variety of food to choose for and still very reasonable price with the new government tightening the pricing to attract tourists. I would recommend here if you want to try variety of Singaporean food.
4
We always come to newton Circus hawker to find Halal Chilli Crab. The official halal sign appears in the particular sea food stalls. Mostly delicious, You must try Chilli Crab, Grilled Stingray and Fired Mantou
4
Visited for dinner one night after a recommendation from the hotel. Glad we went. There are a lot of vendors to choose from and a good choice of food.It is mainly seafood, but there are noodle dishes and chicken on offer. Have to recommend the grilled prawns, chilli crab, followed by an ice cold tiger.It isn't the cheapest food on offer in Singapore, but some of the freshest
3
Well we decided that we would go and have some dinner at the Newton centre. I had been there 30 years ago it would be similar, then it was very much like to the seafood marking where we could choose our own food and They would cook it in front of you. However it is quite different now and the selections are very similar across the board. It was hot and could not find a table so we left. It was quite cheap however
2
This place is way more expensive then the maxwell road hawker centre but it does have alot of seafood dishes. We went on a Sunday for lunch and only about 1/4 of the places were open. Head to maxwell toad hawker centre for better food and cheaper prices.
4
Newton Hawker Centre is just a short walk from the Sheraton Towers. Be aware, however, that it will require a small hike up a long flight of stairs to get up to the overpass to cross Bukit Timah Road. The food selection is good and very inexpensive. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to visit this Hawker Centre as there are many in Singapore, but if in the area, I would definitely recommend it
5
Went with son and our wives. He is a regular and made straight for Alliance Seafood number 27 and Alvin. They are in the Michelin Guide. We shared a variety of platters and I liked them all, but especially the calamari. This is alfresco eating and the centre is full of locals. So it should have been good and certainly was
2
Food quality is really quite poor : stingray was old & smelly , sambal was straight out of a bottle ; vegetables were old & woody ; satay was mediocre etc etc Very very expensive Far better places to eat in Singapore than this tourist tra
4
We were staying in the centre of Singapore and found it very easy to use the public transport and go further afield. We took the tube to Newton Circus, which was cheap and the trains ran regularly. The actual food market has outside seating for diners and the idea is you choose from the menus of any of the food venues. We got rice from one, drinks from another and the main meal from a third... It's a kind of mix and match and each venue gives you a bill for what you had from their menu. Overall, it was a cheap night out and we enjoyed the food
5
Local food at it's best at very fair price also closest to city center. All best grill seafood counter 39 is awesome, go order from the famous lady bee hive (big hair lady) she's super nice.
4
Very busy but excellent food. Good prices and typical Singapore atmosphere. A little touristy but frequented by a lot of locals.
4
Nice little centre, focused mostly on seafood. Black Pepper crab is delicious. Also have beer towers icy cold.
5
Delicious and such good service... and friendly, food fresh and piping hot! Good selection and lovely atmosphere, also the lady who looks after the drinks, awesome
4
Overall, I liked this Hawker Center the best of the 3 that I have visited. it's not the biggest, but it is clean, easy to get to (very close to subway stop), and they have a very good variety of food and drinks. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall the other hawker centers selling oyster omelettes...but they had them here...and it was delicious
4
One of the best oyster omelette in Singapore. Still the best to date. We have been eating from this Aunty for more than 10 years. Her oyster omelette is always fried to the right colour, nicely browned, and not too oily. The oysters... Always big and very fresh. A must try when you are at newton hawker. Also generous with her garnishing of coriander and spring onion. A must-eat when there
5
This the original street food presented in a safe clean environment . Grab a table and choose from the 100's of different places , lots of cold beer on Ice . Take a seat and they come to you , if they have not got it ask 
5
This was my fifth visit to Singapore and I couldn't not go to Newton Circus. I first went there in 1980: it was amazing then and, I was now delighted to see, it still is amazing ...So many stalls are so very good: there are several good satay stalls (actually they're all good!) while the seafood - particularly the tiger prawns - is wonderful. We especially liked the food from Stall 49 (curiously named 'Denmark Seafood') who seemed to have a symbiotic relationship with Stall 48 ('Sim Huat') who kept us plied with those large bottles of Tiger Beer.At the end of that particular evening these good people bade us goodbye - shaking hands with us - with a cheerful "see you again". They will: we will be back
5
When I asked taxi driver to take me to hawker centre he wanted to know if it was the right address ? It a culture shock initially from beautiful restaurants to London wooden tables and benches and not many foreigners there ! You go from stall to stall seeing all this freshly cooked food and deciding what to have .I had chicken satay yo die for special flavoured rice and crab to die for .No wonder this is where the locals eat best meal I have had since arriving in Singapore and such good value for money a definite must when visiting Singapore 
3
Newton Hawker Centre has become a must visit on the tourist check list. I've been visiting for the past 35 years. The food is varied and affordable. But like most street food it's invariably acceptable quality. The centre is open well past midnight so it's a popular late night option. Local favourites include oyster omelet, sate, chicken rice and a wide variety of sea food.It's prudent to check what the ordered items will cost while ordering
5
still stunning array of delicacies to sample and get a good cross section of the best cuisine in the country. well priced, handy vendors who find a seat and a cold beer for you...love the whole thing. satays and chilli crab the best pics.
5
The food is amazing. Lots of fun and the food is great. Lots of stalls. Try lots of things. The stingray is good, but be sure to scrape it sideways instead of trying to cut into it to avoid the bones. Great food!
5
Lovely outdoor dining atmosphere With ample parking space. We had Black Pepper crab with seafood Fried Rice and we loved every bit of it. I tried the sugar cane juice and ended up having 2 glasses. The place was crowded but the service was prompt & very courteou
2
Disappointing experience. This hawker centre is not what it used to be. It now caters to tourists looking for sea food. Most stalls sell sea food...which also means there's a big competition amongst hawkers and you can feel quite intimidated by them trying to make a sale. There are much better places to eat in Singapore.
2
I guess it would be correct to say, one gets what one is paying for. Still I think in Singapore, One can get a more satisfying meal for the same budget elsewhere. I was surprised to see many locals here too but I won't be back
4
A big improvement on the old hawker centre I remember from years ago. All paved, clean, wash basins provided, and the food was good. Not cheap by street food standards but reasonably priced and a "small" serve was still plenty for one or as part of a number of share plates for two. Not overly hassled by vendors to take their menus. Selected from a variety of stalls. Service was quick. All the food was tasty. Mainly seafood but other meat choices available. Went on a friday night and no problems to get a table before 7pm but then was very busy after that. Better signage once you come out of the exit at Newton MRT would be useful (follow the path sharp left out of station exit
3
This is a cheap eat, and it should be. The quality ordinary. The shellfish I had and on previous occasions looks great but lacks flavour, I suspect all farmed and I don't dare ask where (or how). I enjoy watching the life at this place and how the stall owners work. A different view of the world
4
Newton Hawker Centre is/was always popular with foreigners ,tourist and expat alike, which live nearby or in CBD area. This explains also why its more expansive compare to other Hawker centres. Food quality and choice is good and tasty and nowadays you get a table faster then before
4
I grew up with Newton. This was our fave food place after a night out in town during the 1990s. The current revamped hawker street food is more organized and cleanliness has improved tremendously. Some all time fave food would include prawn noodle soup, oyster omelette, BBQ chicken wings, BBQ stingray in sambal chilli sauce and hokkien fried prawn noodles. There is a Chinese dessert stall in the left hand row as you enter via the car park. They have one of the best Chinese dessert selection at good value prices. Dining here this evening certainly brought back many memorie
5
I've searched this hawker food here in TripAdvisor and satisfied with the reviews so I decided to have a visit. The place was so clean and they offer lots of food variety, name it and I'm sure they have it here. From noodles to rice chicken and duck. I'm telling you this is a must try if you are visiting Singapore try hawker food it's cheap like 5 to 10 SGD only for a complete heavy set of meal with a nice shakes! You're missing something in Singapore if you don't try this one
3
Always a decent food court. Never disappointed and the food is always acceptable. The chili crab is 1/3 the price of Jumbo Restaurant and I think it tastes much better when eaten with fried ManTo.
4
I love the diverse food you can get here! The stall holders are all very knowledgable and are very accommodating. You must give this a go when you are in Singapore.
4
After our last visit over 20 years ago, the place had changed, but the food was equally good.
Reasonable prices for local dishes.
Worth a visit.
5
Only 50 metres away from the newton train station. All cash but there are atm there. So much to choice from. Cooked while you wait and very cheap local food. Loved it and will return again.
5
Food nice and good price newton in the best place to eat and hangout .
Ive been staying here a year and always going out with friends to have dinner here . Stingray and calamary is good
5
Friendly stall holders, wonderful food! Prices are very good, service is excellent. Drinks are at reasonable prices. Table service is fast and efficient. If they don't have what you want, they will find a stall that does!! Best hawker we have been to
5
Not too far from Orchard rd, 5 minutes by taxi or 20 minute walk from Far east plaza. to a yummy outdoor food court. Great service as you grab a table which is numbered, order your food and drink and they bring to your table freshly cooked. Satays, calamari and chicken wings were yummy. The satays so delicious that we ordered another batch of 50 amongst a family of 5. Relaxing outdoor setting on a balmy night eating Satays and drinking ling neck Tiger beers and the kids drinking freshly squeezed juices was sensational and very reasonably priced
5
This hawkers market has recently been given a make over. Lovely clean tables and seats with plent of room for all. So many choices that it gets hard to decide what and where to eat. The food is fresh, flavorful and cheap. Order you meals from the hawkers and they deliver your selections to your table and then you pay them. Cash only trade here. Watch out for the man selling tissues, as the hawkers don't have napkins. A must to visit in Singapore
4
This has got to be one of the best places to visit to experience the broad range of foods groups and styles typical to Singapore and the Asian region. Open all night it is also a great place for supper after a few drinks with friends. They used to have the biggest chicken wings I had ever seen but not anymoreThis time it was oyster omelet and mutton soup on the way home. So much choice there is something for everybod
4
If you like your food al fresco with about a thousand others, both locals and tourists, this is your go to place. Newton has become our first checkpoint whenever we travel to Singapore.Endorsed by the Singaporean Tourism promotion board you get a first profile of local cuisine at 83 food stalls. Not all of them are different though. Among locals Newton has gained notoriety as some stalls were overcharging for their seafood. So better check prices and make sure you don't receive something you did not order. We however did not encounter any problems. Stall owners were friendly, food arrived fast and we got what we ordered. We enjoyed yummy fish ball kway tiao, excellent chicken wings and tasty kalian.
3
There is plenty of choice and the food seems fresh. Its very tasty and everyone is catered for. Definitely worth a visit for a cheap eat.
4
Crowded mostly by locals, not centrally located but worth a visit.
Big variety of local food, other asian countries cuisines also available.
Satay, chicken rice, carrot cake and all traditional singapore dishes are available here.
Good prices and nice place.
1
Any shopping mall food court offers better value than this dump! Despite being heavily promoted by the STB, this crummy food centre is not truly representative of SG food. Even Lau Pa Sat is better than this.
4
Many, many years ago, the hawker centre was at the Orchard Road in front of Cold Storage supermarkets. It still has a similar vibe. Chinese, Malay, seafood.... Clean and true food. A definite must visit!
4
A place which you can try most of the local food in one place.We usually visit this place once a month. And the usual stalls that we will visit is 'Hai Yan Seafood' and the fried oyster egg stall which the auntie has a bit of attitude problem. :p But the fried oyster egg is really yummy.The staff at 'Hai Yan' is super friendly. The stall is facing the main car park of Newton Circus. The service is good, price is reasonable and the food is yummy. We always order the sambai stingray and clams.
3
Newton Hawker Centre was my least favourite of the 6 food centres we visited during our recent 4-day holiday to Singapore.It was hot and very busy on the Friday night we were there....the aromas of cooking food filled the air.There was nothing wrong with the food we received....in fact it was quiet impressive. BBQ stingray....black pepper crab and satay.......all were delicious. Prices were reasonable....but not as cheap as other centres.I think it was the atmosphere here that was the biggest let down for me.....all the stall holders are out the front of their stalls touting. It was the least "authentic" of all the food centres we visited. As a tourist......don't let this be your only food centre experience in Singapore.....there are so many better options for you to try!
5
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. A great mix of options and a good intro to Hawker Centres. It's clean enough without being too sanitised - bustling and (important bit) the food options are good. Also, drinks are a lot cheaper than in hotels so have a few beers while you're there. Note: Hawker Centres are not great for vegetarians at all - very few dishes that are all vegetable even, and I suspect even those ones may be cooked using some seafood-based sauces and / or in pans that are also used for meat/poultry/seafood
3
It's one of the obligatory stops when bringing tourists around Singapore. This one is just off the Newton MRT stop (one away from Orchard) and is almost always packed - not with locals but with tourists. Yes, the cereal prawns are tasty, the satay tender and salted egg crab really yummy but if one would cost SG$60++, then I will have to refrain from coming back. If you find yourself here, best to look for a table ans order from any of the establishments circling the center. The "uncles" would gladly cook your orders and deliver them to your table.
3
Went to Newton Hawker Centre for dinner. This place used to have a wide variety of very decent food at reasonable prices but now seems to be predominantly seafood stalls, drinks stalls and one or two others. Some of the traders persistently tout their stalls despite the rules against this, and others can be quite aggressive about pushing you towards their stalls. The food is pretty pricey for what you get, especially the drinks. We had some decent satay, but the drinks (fruit juices) were watered down
3
We recently revisited this hawker centre on a trip to Singapore. Granted it was a Friday night but boy were we shocked with the crowds. We could not find a seat anywhere and spent twenty minutes looking for two seats. Once you find your seat, you can proceed to order your food. We had satay and I had to have the spicy stingray. My husband had nasi goring and it was all fine. I have to say the place was super busy and we waited longer than usual for our food. It was definitely an experience and was good to eat at this long standing Singaporean institution. I would recommend not going on a Friday night unless you are in early as it was crazy! It's also very cheap and I would also suggest pinning the seafood stalls down to a price before ordering. Some of them don't have menus with prices on them and I think this is a bit risky customers.
4
This was not the cheapest hawker centre we encountered but it was a winner. All the dishes we tried were great. We will be back!
5
Go to Mike with red hair... Delicious... Cannot recommend highly enough.. Chilli crab so good and a very good price!! Kids here on holiday and couldn't wait to go back.. Also stall next the lady who sells drinks so so nice
3
took a few Aussies for dinner to sample the array of local and regional fare available.
A bit of a disappointment unfortunately.
5
OK, it is influenced by tourist, but still authentic enough to be recommended especially noting the location. It is a 15 Minute walk from Orchard corner Scotts. Too bad that no authentic Laksa place remained after the recent Renovation. Washrooms much better now.
3
You may find this place cheap and value for money while gathering with friends. I usually have beers with friends after work here. However, for seafood lover, remember to ensure the prices before you ordering. Some seafood stalls will charge foreigner higher prices. They open till late night so it's a great place after late work.
3
There are many many different stalls here. Hence, the quality varies. When you get a table, stalls selling seafood will pass you their menus. Ignore if you are not interested. Choose what food you would like and remember to give the stall your table number. Some of the food is top quality stuff, so choose wisely! Furthermore, the food centre looks much better after the recent renovation
3
At first glance, it's a nice place to get a variety of local fares in one location, with nice open air seating. But it's a bit of a tourist trap, with some of the food being too expensive for local standards. I do have some friends who come from overseas and hear from word of mouth to come here, but for the same variety of food, I'd prob take them somewhere else to get cheaper food, such as Chomp Chomp or even East Coast. But if you do choose to eat there, some of the local delicacies to order include: BBQ Sambal Stingray, BBQ Chicken Wings, Hokkien Mee, Carrot Cake and sugarcane to wash it down
5
What a selection - food in Singapore is very safe to eat as very strict guidelines apply. Great selection of food in Hawkers markets. Find a table and note the number on table. Order and pay for food from the many different little food stalls providing table number - When food or drinks are ready stall worker brings to table
5
Took the train to Newton station to have chilli crab on our last day, had to be done. Getting of the train you come out by a roundabout in a nothing looking part of town. Thanks to Google maps for showing the way as it looked like there was nothing there. After locating the area, a triangle of seating and small cooking shacks we went around to view the variety on display. We decided on 31 Heng Heng BBQ. The place was spotlessly clean and the crabs were top quality, heavy and fresh. We ordered a $38 crab and some fried rice. What can I say but it was the best crab I have had, so much meat it easily fed two of us. The sauce was medium hot but you could go either way by request. Highly Recommended
2
When I first came to Singapore I visited many Hawker centres, then I visited Newton to see what the hype was about. Sadly, I was met with pushy vendors, expensive prices, disposable plates, small serves compared to the many other "non-tourist" hawker centres. Get a bus further up Bukit Timah Rd to Adam road and try the hawker there - it's so much better
3
You can get many things to eat of a Malay-Chinese nature. Just go around and choose what you want, they'll bring it to your table. The quality is not the best but it is authentic and colourful.
4
The Newton Circus of old, and what exists now. are world's apart. The food hasn't changed much (it was always worth having), but the physical setting has, and it is much for the better. It is brighter, cleaner, and amazingly efficient. But beware, the seafood dishes can be very expensive
4
I was recommended this venue by a friend who lived here for 10 years, as an alternative to the east coast seafood market, as it was raining when I visited. This indeed is a really cool place for chilli or pepper crab, and an array of other Asian foods.A big tip to remember here is to ask the stall seller to weigh your food first before ordering, as prices vary greatly.Worth a visit, and easy access by taxi and MRT
4
I was looking to try some local delicacies when my hotel concierge advised to visit Newton Hawker street. For my 6 day Singapore visit, I visited this place twice for dinner. The only catch is to wear loose and light clothes as this place is open and was pretty humid outside. Overall must visit
1
This is good for tourists. It appears cheap. You can get good quality meals for $10-$15. I've been here 3 times now. I'm over it. The food is just like most other hawkers but it's more expensive for all food and drinks at this place. And the hawker people heckle you to buy. I hate being heckled or having menus shoved in my face or someone saying "my food is good for your tummy, boss". If you want good seafood without restaurant prices like Jumbo, then go here. If you're a tourist, this is a good first experience to hawkers. Otherwise, I would never tell someone to go here. I hate this place
3
I came here probably an hour or so after the lunch rush, so not many people were around and about two thirds of the stalls were closed. I definitely wouldn't characterize this as "cheap street food"; the prices were comparable to restaurants with similar fare. I had some kind of noodley stir fry thing from a place that claimed to have "Famous Muslim Food". It was tasty. This is very convenient to get to by MRT
3
We weren't planning to go to this hawker's market but the other one had closed the night before for refurbishment - what are the chances!They're certainly not places that encourage long hours of sitting around with that harsh lighting, but then they don't pretend to be either. This is about the food!Tried several stalls, some were delicious, some dubious(!) but that's what you'd expect. I'm glad I went, just wouldn't feel the need to rush back to this one. We also went just outside to Satay Alley outside which I preferred as it felt much more lively and in the thick of things. All in all, quick food, great to explore and try new dishes and flavours and not wildly overpriced
4
We went one evening just for a drink as we could walk from our hotel , it was late on a Saturday night and still very busy . It looked very clean and lots of wash basins around the edge to be able to wash your hands after messy food like chilli crab . We went back on Monday and it was still surprisingly busy . It was good food but not much for a vegetarian . It is priced reasonably and a family of three sat at our table as it is free seating and chatted to us . It is well worth a visit 
5
On the way to the center of the city, Newton Hawker Centre has a variety of options. I heard about it many times. However after living in Singapore for almost 4 years, we accidentally landed there. It has been an awesome experience of seafood - pepper crab, cereal prawn, kai lang in oyster sauce, chicken fried rice - all MUST try @Heng Heng BBQ-(31) - thanks for making our first trip a memorable one - we will definitely be back soon Kishaloya - Singapore, May 2016
3
Went to Newton to see its latest incarnation,a bit too sanitised for us.It was Mothers day weekend and very busy. We were instantly bombarded with large menus in our faces from stall holders, it gave you no chance to have a good look at all the stalls. Found a shared table eventually, ordered the food and then went for drinks.The prices we paid were nearly 50% more than Maxwell rd. and it was mostly seafood on offer, we also like to pay for food as we order it, the people on the other end of our table were having a dispute with a stall holder about overcharging them.A good halfway house between Maxwells or Lau pa sat and a restaurant
3
A lot of seafood served here so ideal if you want seafood, not as much variety and seemed more expensive than other hawker centres iv been to. Just across the road from Newton train station
2
This is a classic ripoff hawker center. You need to challenge the prices if you are a foreigner because they always try to cheat you. I used to live very near and went there many times. Just beware
4
Great hawker market for a cheap meal in Singapore. Lots of stalls around the edges with tables in the middle the only problem is deciding what to try! We had a delicious satay and fried carrot cake with two very cold large beers. Top food, great experience wish I could have dinner here every night
3
A good hawker centre for seafood. We went on Mother's day so it was very very busy, our last visit was 15 years ago and sadly IMHO it had changed for the worse. I now much prefer Maxwell, Chinatown or even some of the enclosed food centres. It was busy mostly with locals so they can't all be wrong. Because it specialises in seafood the meals are generally more expensive than other centres. But not really expensive compared to restaurants.
4
Don't come here just for the seafood. Eat what the locals eat! You can barely see locals ordering seafood here, so look around the tables to get an idea of what to eat.Some recommendations that won't break the bank will be oyster omelette, prawn noodles with soup, fish soup noodles, fried prawn noodles, fried noodles (char kway teow) and shaved ice to top it off
5
We have just spent three days in Singapore and had lunch at the Newton Hawker Centre twice. The tiger prawns cooked with lots of garlic and the stingray with a hot sauce were fantastic. Had them both days. Beer was also pretty cheap with a big bottle of Tiger only $7.50 (compared to what you would pay in a bar or hotel for a small bottle). Definitely recommend
4
Long before Newton Hawker Center came to be associated with expensive grilled seafood for tourists, locals used to come here for :1. Tanglin Hokkien noodles and oyster omelette 2. Bee Heng popiah and satay3. Heng fied carrot cake (this is actually mashed turnip/radish fried with egg, garlic and spring onions and, as an option - a sweet black sauce).We visited this evening for takeout of the Hokkein noodles, chicken satay and popiah. The Hokkein noodles fried fresh prawns and squid and a tasty prawn stock and, served with delicious sambal chilli and freshly squeezed lime juice was as good as it ever was (in high priced Singapore portions have shrunk though).The satay (boneless chicken skewered on wooden sticks and grilled) was fragrant and tender as was the roasted peanut gravy it was served with.The popiah didn't live up to expectations though - this is similar in concept to the Vietnamese rice paper rolls. The SE Asian version has stewed turnip, crunchy peanuts, chopped boiled egg and lettuce wrapped in thin popiah skin made from rice flour. The popiah skin does not have the translucent sticky texture of the Vietnamese version - it has a drier more grainy texture. What we got at Newton though was a little too dried out and the stewed turnip didn't have the depth of flavour we remembered.

Day 1 of our brief trip to Singapore concluded with dinner at this well known Hawker Centre in Newton Circus. A short taxi ride away from our Hotel.One is spoilt for choice at this venue with several hawkers all offering the same menu - be it seafood, or Malay Muslim cuisine, etc. Other hawkers only deal in fruit juices, soft drinks and beers.After a brief wander, we decided on Takara Grilled Seafood (Shop No. 74) run by Winnie.My wife and I shared the Black Pepper Singapore Crab, a baby Stingray and a portion of Seafood Noodles - ample quantities and really delicious. We had asked Winnie to hold the spice which was done.....The Hawker Centre was bustling and appears very popular with both residents and tourists. We returned to our hotel by Metro as Newton Station is a short walk away from the Hawker Centre
3
Opened on 24 April 2016 after renovation. Been a regular there for many years, prices are not very cheap. Be careful, especially the stall owners and touts like to overcharge foreigners, although that happening now is lesser as stalls face punishment if they tout. Follow the queues. Sporeans are food junkies. They know where is the best food.
5
Very good variety of local cuisine and also alot of fresh seafood dishes to choose from. Would recommend this place to many tourists as the place accomodates to many people and has quite a huge varety of local dishes. One may also compare this to the famous Lau Pa Sat which is another food place enjoyed by both locals and tourists.
5
Fresh cheap and you cannot go wrong here!
Personal favourite spot!
The 'Chilli Crab' is amazing too! Everthing thing else really is actually!
5
Experience good food and mix with the locals. Close to the MRT. Chilli crab is a must. Table service from Aunty was awesome!
4
Make sure you try the chilli crab and chilly stingray we sometimes make a special effort when in Asia to visit Singapore just to eat at this hawker centre
3
Newton is a tourist food market in my opinion, the taxi drivers will try to take you there if asked where is a good place to go. There are plenty of stalls to choose from and don't worry about the stall owners hassling you just find a seat then walk around the stalls to see what you like, the routers will try to get you to sit in their stall location. The food is very good and a reasonable price but can get better else where cheaper. It is an experience to say the least. Take a taxi or the MRT is right there as well so easy to get to. Funny enough we have den there several times and stall 69 s eels to be a good place to site and eat but have a look your self before choosing.There are clean toilets on site which us a bonu
3
We lived close by for quite a while so we went here now and again, the food is ok but its so easy to spend a lot if you start ordering what they are famous for - seafood. Many of the prices are per 100g and the cost quickly adds up. Its worth a visit but you definitely need to confirm the price before you order. The vendors will let you run up a bill before they let you kno
4
Wanted to visit Newton Circus last night, but the taxi driver convinced us that the place has been closed. So decided to visit Lau Pa Sat instead after 20 years. No reason to go back there again. Food was below par, the whole place was somehow very messy. Very crowded though, so not everyone may share our feeling.Just checked, according to the National Environment Agency homepage Newton Circus is closed on 1 February - 24 April 2016. Suprised to see some reviews from February visits.Anyway, waiting for the next visit to Newton. Maybe not the most original of hawker centers, but we've always been happy with the food and service in general
5
This place is a large outdoor foodcourt. Its a hawker centre, opens later in the day. Plenty of tourist and locals eat here. Food is pretty cheap here. I spent $5 in total for a decent meal with a drink here. The skewers are the best, costing me only 60c per stick. No table service, and no air-conditioning, its outdoor. So its a bit hot and humid, but thats normal singapore weather. Overall, an enjoyable experience
3
Very good variety of local food. However, tourists must beware. Some of these hawkers will sell you food that are way overpriced. Eating in a hawker centre should be a cheap and affordable experience. Not an expensive one. Check prices of items before ordering and you will never go wrong
4
Having read about hawker centres we wanted to experience one and this was the closest to our hotel (walking distance) I read that all Singapore eateries are hygiene rated and whilst a hawker stall rarely if ever achieves A status there are plenty of B status to choose from. The food we chose was very very tasty and very very cheap, the most expensive thing was beer. Well worth a visit if you want to experience the real food of Singapor
3
Decent food court that seems to specialise in seafood. Not as much of a tourist trap as expected, although not the cheapest food for hawker centre. Food was ok quality however, and lots of choice. A good stop for my first night back in Singapore!Was very busy, but there are lots of tables, so seating rarely an issue. It does have a good feeling about it though, not quite so drab and functional as some of the other hawker centres in town. Good place to get acclimatised
1
This place is a total rip off and tourist trap. Food is average at best. Go to other hawker center for better experience such as Maxwell, Tiong Bahru, etc. The locals don't come here.

Dress down, chill out, dining with a beer!! Based around a set courtyard with vendors serving diners in reach of their cabin. This place is 24 hours and is also respected for its cleanliness - Worth the cab ride!
5
Great food - cheap, great beer - cheap. Good atmosphere and friendly staff/workers. We loved it here. You should try it if you visit and particularly like seafood.

Superb evening that lasted well towards midnight, must be the cheapest way to have ice-cold beers with friends in Singapore. The outdoor style is lovely but it gets very hot! Love the carrot cake place and the pirate seafood stall! Delicious! Clean toilets and great choice of local delights!

Some vendors are bad. Some are good. This is a tourist trap. Prices are higher than other place. If you want to try chili crab and xereal prswns. Expect to pay around 100 sg. 40 sg for crab 25 to 40 for prawns depends on size of plate you order. Tables always full but you can find a seat. Alot of people eat and leave. Tried to order satay from 1 vendor told me sold out... but had alot of sticks still in stall.Tried to order oyster egg. Vendor told me dont order unless you willing to wait 30 mins. Crab was nothing special. Boiled crab. Pour chili sauce on it.Cereal prawns. Fresh and ok... but not my type of dish

I consider this Hawker Food Centre a ''Must'' to visit every time I'm in Singapore . The choice of regional dishes is very large indeed , and I'm never disappointed , regardless of what I elect to eat any particular evening ... be it Thai , or Indian or the standard Singaporian noodle dishes in any of their many varieties . Fish , meat , fowl , or vegetarian , it all seems good to me ! Price per basic dish is almost invariably under $10 , and satay costs 70cents a stick . Plenty of choice of drinks , tho' I invariably go for the freshly opened coconut + a straw while waiting for my order of food to be served .The layout of this Centre has changed very considerably from its previous format . The hawker food stalls are arranged around a central open air eating area ( though there is a fair amount of covered eating available if it rains ) . One would do well to check the weather forecast on the excellent local web site NEA-MISS before going ! I recommend taking a stroll round all the stalls in the outer perimeter to see what takes one's fancy . Do not be pressurised by any vendor into taking a seat alongside his particular stall until you've made up you mind ( or unless you are by yourself ) . Otherwise pick seating for yourselves , preferably in the central open area , before you go and order any dish .... but you MUST remember your table number to place your order ( and exactly where it is , so YOU can find your way back to it again ) Leave one of you at the table to ''reserve'' your seats while the other(s) place orders .I've always found the food quality very good , and frequently excellent , but it's a matter of personal taste , and sometimes of luck . What is encouraging is the number of ''locals'' packing into the place for an evening meal . Extremely easy to get to . Take the MRT to Newton station , and it's a 5 minute walk from there . Savour the food as much as you'll enjoy the buzz of the experience . Enjoy

Visited twice for dinner during my stay in Singapore. Essentially the Hawkers have almost identical food, but what differentiates each of them is the personal touch in the taste based on the hawkers own style conditioned from the individual cultural & regional backgrounds. Must try the Chilli beef and the sting-ray. You can also order beers from and RTD bottles from most of the hawkers and have a drink with your meal. Great place to visit with friends, family or even a lone traveller

I had previous eaten in the Hawker market in both Chinatown and Little India, however this was a difference experience. Being more little stands to chose from. My friends and I several types of food. Chinese, Indian, and Japanese. The atmosphere is really lively and lots of fun. The real plus was lots of tables with umbrellas if the weather gets wet, and a restroom with plenty of area to wash up after the somewhat messy chili crabs
2
We explored the Newton Hawker, Lau Pa Sat and a local hawker center called Whampoa Hawker Center during our recent trip to Singapore. Amongst the 3, we rated Newton the lowest. We visited Newton and Whampoa for lunch respectively. Whampoa, which is connected to a local housing estate, has long lines in many stalls during lunch and is full of life. We were indeed on our way to Newton and the taxi driver recommended Whampoa instead of Newton. We tried the Hainanese boneless chicken rice, and the spicy turnip, peanut, bean sprout, pineapple salad at Balestier Road Hoover Rojak, made famous by HK movie star Chow Yun Fat. All utensils are reusable, a big thumbs up from our family as we care a lot about the environment. The atmosphere is friendly, pricing is affordable and the service is great. The next day we made a trip to Newton because of our positive experience at Whampoa. Over 2/3 of the stalls at Newton were not opened, so it's pretty lifeless. We had a Ba Kut Teh (pork rib soup) and a roasted chicken rice. Food quality was okay. Yet the food stalls in general use a lot of disposable utensils and styrofoam. It is not at all impressive. Please also note that Newton will be closed for renovation from Feb - Apr 2016

Stall 82 (Lucky) served up some good BBQ sting ray with sambal sauce. They charged us $14 per butterfly prawns which was tasteless and tough after being overcooked. They had sprinkled on some half cooked garlic for flavour. Massive rip off. Stall 73 served a tasty oyster omelette but you only get a very small amount of oysters. Stall 13, the famous duck noodles was salty and the saltiness was so overpowering. Their curry char siew, nothing to write home about. So disappointing. Other hawker centres have much tastier and cheaper food. Will not come again even if it is just around the cnr from home
4
Easily found close to the MRT line. Cheap with a wide variety of food.. High turn over with fresh quality food.
5
Great food and a fantastic way to experience Singapore food hawker culture, can have a number of different dishes and enjoy a great taste variety , my favourites are stingray, Kang Kong with sambal and chilli prawns delicious
5
A must visit- if you love to experiment with local food and wash down with ice cold beer! Open air seating , which is very nice in December. Must try the Singapore Chilli Crabs with the little Buns! Beautiful....
5
Must visit if u dig street food. Bestsingapore crabs, butter garlic prawns from MsTau at stall 70 and try the food from also stall 31.
5
Visited with friends. This food is mildly cheaper than the food courts in the shopping centres but the atmosphere was much better.Look at the vendors shop fronts. If it says "self service" it means you have to take your food to the table, if not, they will deliver the food to you (so take note of your table number). We had the Char Siu, steamed veges, butter chicken Paneer, naan & satay. All very nice. Adequate portions
4
We caught a cab here one night particularly for chilli crab. It only cost us about S$18 by cab from the Carlton hotel. We walked around before choosing which hawker we would eat at. The prices all seem much the same. We had 4 huge prawns around 200g ea, we paid $8 per 100g so $16 per prawn. Our crab was a medium size & cost us $40. We bought beers from the stall next door. It was a great fun experience & the food tasted great
5
We visited 'Newton Circus' 3 times whilst in Singapore and each time was amazing All stores are basically the same type of food/dishes and quality, so doesn't matter what stall you order from, you're guaranteed a tasty, cheap meal! $4 per 100g for crab, (make sure you find out the weight of the crab before purchasing, we got a kg crab which was about $40aud) then choose your flavour, we tried the black pepper crab on our first visit and chilli crab on our 2nd, both were amazingly tasty, sweet juicy crab meat! Very messy, but definitely worth it, don't forget to order a portion of fried buns to mop up all the juices! The prawns are also tasty, but again just make sure you find out how much they weigh before ordering, otherwise you could end up with a massive bill (and a lot of wasted food) we had one prawn each, this prawn was as long and wide as my hand when sliced down the centre! Plump and juicy! One was more than enough, the equivalent of maybe 6 Australian king prawns! We also tried blachan stingray, and oh my god, what a flavour explosion! Another must try when in Singapore! Drinks are also cheap, around $2 for a soft drink and about $7 for a beer/cider. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Singapore!
5
We knew the food would be good and cheap. The big bonus was cheap beer (compared to every other venue in town). A big bottle of Tiger set me back $9.50 which is considerably better than the $12 to $18 for a small bottle in other city venues. Food preparation was fast and the taste was awesome. Everything was fresh as these vendors go through a lot of product nightly. Go on your own, as a couple, as a family, or as a group of friends on a night out. Make this the starting point for dinner before hitting the town
5
We went to this hawkers' market and were delighted with the food. We were helped by the man at the A1 food stall who organised for a table in the middle to be cleared for us. He then explained how things work there and ordered drinks for us. We ordered our meal from him and he brought us the most delicious noodles, chilli crab and garlic prawns all for $75 for 2 people. He brought us a large finger bowl as the crab is messy to eat and then when we finished he brought over some wet wipes. There's a great atmosphere there with about 80 stalls to choose from.
5
So many selections of local specialities only wish I have more stomach to try them all !! Chilli crab is not to be missed ..can be pricey but still lot cheaper than other places ..make sure to tell the waiter to show you the catch or the weight of the crab before it gets cooked so you have an idea how much the dish will cost
4
The location is excellent, the variety of food superb. No matter what is your taste, Chinese, Fish, Malay, Indian, Thai.......you'll for sure find what you are looking for. A lot of family business guarantee a perfect service.
4
Ideally located opposite Newton MRT, this food centre offers an array of choices - mostly Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Indian & Thai cuisine.
5
We recently ate dinner at this hawker centre, the food was fantastic. Store 70 had fantastic food, also satay close by had great food also. Reasonable price.
5
I never go to Singapore without going to Newton Hawker Center. If you haven't ever been to a Food/Hawker center in Singapore, Do it!!! It's the cheapest way to eat while in Singapore. I've been to a few hawker centers around Singapore and this one is the biggest and best I've been to. There are tables and chairs set up in the center, they are surrounded by loads of food stalls selling a variety of Malaysian, Indo, Chinese food. Each stall sells something specific, some serve drinks, some don't. Find a table first, place a packet of tissues on the table to 'hold' it (or have someone sit there and mind the table), take note of the table number, then go in search for food of your choice. Some stalls will ask for your table number and bring it over when ready, others may make you wait while they cook it. Must tries are; BBQ stingray, fried squid, satay skewers, Otah and cold bean curd. And of cause a large bottle of Tiger beer
4
This was a fun experience. To set the scene, the hawker stalls are basically in a circle, with an open air eating area in the centre. You walk in and start doing a lap to pick out what looks good. If you don't enjoy the hawker experience then avoid this place. There is a good range of food to choose from, including Singapore Chilli Crab. We got our Singapore Chilli Crab from Mrs Tan at stall 66, although I believe she normally works out of stall 72. We got some satay sticks from stall 74, and a cold beer to wash it down. I wouldn't call the food cheap, but it wasn't too expensive either. in fact, all things considered, the beer was relatively the most expensive thing there at $7 SD a glass. The food was quick and tasty. The meal was all the more enjoyable because the stall operator Mrs tan came over to chat with us. Do make sure you have plenty of napkins as the Singapore Crab is messy. Worth the visit for the experience.
4
If you want some tasty, local and value for money food and a typical Singaporean experience then head to Newton hawker centre - 2 mins walk from the Newton MRT station.Lots of food stalls selling a variety of food and drinks, great place to take friends as its such a social place.
5
I have tried several different chilli crab places and salty crab places - they all taste different. I was told on the first day by the store owners they are all the same taste. I have to recommend stall 19 for their salty egg crab. Mr and toddler loved it. We went back everyday of our stay in Singapore. Price is decent and a variety of dishes chilli or not.
5
We went during the day which we found out is not a popular time but we still had the chilli crab my husband was chasing. Cost was $40 and the taste was top notch! He also had sambal stingray for $12 which he loved aswell. I had pork and noddles which cost me $5 - make the effort
3
Went to Newton Hawker Center where the choice of food is endless ranging from Malay, Chinese, Curries,and many desserts. At each table there is number, which you need to inform food staller so he can bring your order. Please bring your own napkins as I found out that most eateries do not supply .The food at Newton Hawker Center is relatively inexpensive. We had Hainese Chicken with rice which cost about $5 and also Tom Yum Shrimp noodle soup for $5 for dinner. Both dishes were Ok, but you can do better Lau Pau Sat Food Center which has over 200 food stalls and it is cheaper
4
The last time I was here, I had an absolute shocker. Armed with some better knowledge, and a little bit of caution, a much improved experience. Do not eat anything that does not have a price. A huge variety of local food, follow the locals and eat where it's busy and you won't go wrong. Use some common sense and you will not be disappointed
5
If you are looking for cheap and reasonable eateries, this is it! Good variety of Asian and freshly squeezed juices, beer and what ever drink takes your fancy. You just have to visit just once and make your mind up.
3
The food is mediocre and the location unimpressive. Merely targetting the gullible tourist. I'd give this place a miss and opt for takeaway from the neighbouring 7/11.
5
Thank you Mrs Tan for a great meal on Sunday night. Our buttered king prawns with garlic, calamari rings, fried rice and stir fried bok choy were delicious!!! Highly recommend you eat from Mrs Tan at Stall 70 when in Singapore!!
4
We were really impressed having visited many hawker centres which closed early however this was open really late!Normal priced hawker food, various standard types - Indian, Malay, chicken rice (!). Normal priced beer for a hawker centre, around $6.Only thing that means it isn't a 5* rating is the people in the middle of the hawker centre who hawk and try to get you to buy food from certain stalls and pressure you into buying beer from them. Annoying and off putting.Aside from that, was great
5
So this is suppose to be a tourist trap but it's still so fun. Come at night for dinner or supper simply because there is so many people around. A lot of the stalls seem to sell the same thing which is seafood of various sorts which if fun once in a while. if you are want the more simple stuff like various noodles, po piah or oyster omelette. The thing is there is plenty of choice and there are so many stalls to choose from. It's open air so it can be hot. During the day, it's just not as much fun so it's really a place to come to at night.
3
And so I do, Unless I want thai from 52. The only thai place there. I like the green curry with rice. The store owners are in your face and off-putting for my liking. And even the local paper claims that they overcharge. If you want what the locals like go to Tekka centre. The bus 66 or 67 from newton will take you there easily within 5 minutes. I found the best Garlic naan and chicken tikka.Hawker centres are warm so be ready with a hanky or two
4
Take time to observe before you choose which stall you'll buy your food. If it's frequented by locals, chances are...the food is good. I ordered duck from this outer stall facing the parking lot. Quite unimpressive and only a few duck meat (contrary to what their pictures showed).
4
We came here on the recommendation of a colleague from Singapore. Having stayed at a hotel for a three day work do and not seen much else than the hotel we were keen to use the last remaining hours before our flight back to the UK seeing and tasting the real Singapore. The main problem we were faced with on arrival was the vast choice! Hunger built as we browsed the stalls and took in the sights and smells of pad thai, laksa, curries, crispy duck, satay and lots and lots of other local delicacies. We settled on some thai food that looked super-fresh, pad thai easily the best I've ever had and a green papaya salad not far behind. It's all very basic with paper plates and plastic cutlery, you drink your coke straight from the can, but the food is the main attraction and well worth the $15 cab fare. After a big gala dinner the night before we were also relieved to find it was the best hangover cure ever
4
Newton was my preference to go to after flying in to Singapore on a Friday evening. As a child my parents would use to bring us to visit . Not much has changed ., there are plentiful of choice, Chinese food. Indian , Malay and old favorites plus seafood n great dessert stalls As usual the eye was bigger than the stomach ! We have grilled sting ray with chili sambal - the best ! $12 The satays 80 cents each with min order of 10 sticks were good ! Fried egg oysters, Chinese style fried carrot cake n Indian mamak style fried instant noodle was on order tonightPlus durian ice kachang ! N freshly squeezed sugar cane juice , Great n tasty on a warm eveningLove the fact that you order what you like, choose the size you want and they bring the food to you . Most of these stalls are long time vendors and will still be here for many years to comeAh Newton .. We will certainly be back
5
I could eat here everyday, such is the variety. Yes there are hawks, hence the name but it's all part of the charm to me.Some of the items on offer are genuinely excellent, and of good value. This the signature centre for a reason and has to be part of your itinerary into SG
4
Been to newtons hawker Center many times over the years. The seafood options are very good. My favourite dishes are the sambal prawns, and Sri Lankan pepper crab!!
5
Great food, recommend you look for the lady who takes care of the seafood, chicken and beer stands. far side from the carpark on the side near the road/roundabout
4
A must go in Singapore. Experience the hawker streetfood and eat among the locals. Good solid food. Great variety, since 20+ small kitchens and basic seating & eating facilities under open sky. In general only cash payment. Serves beer as well.
4
I've been here before but it's always good to visit again. You can get good food here but it's not as cheap as some other places but it's still good value. Just be wary of the touts trying to get you to sit down and they try to order for you. Try the oyster omelette and the chili crab.
5
First of all, #70 serves a variety of lovely food in a great and thriving environment you find at Newton Food Center. Second, Ms Tan offers the best hospitality. She is a great mix of being very welcoming and attentive, but on a very comfortable level, as opposed to many others who can be a bit too much. Definitely a place I go to eat every time I visit the city, which I also recommend to all my friends, and now also YOU
5
I would move to Singapore again, just to be near the Hawker food. And Newton Circus is one of the best ones in town. The food is fresh, the place is clean, and if you cannot find what you want here - you will never be happy
4
This is safe street food Singapore style. There is a little bit of hustle from the vendors, but too be honest I have had a lot worse in the past. Plenty of food choices, reasonable prices for SG. All three of us ate from different stall holders and a good was quickly delivered to our tables. Worthy of a visit and if you fancy street food then you know you will be safe here
5
If you ever come to Singapore, this is the place to eat. My husband and I have travelled the world and out of all the places we have eaten, this is our favourite, it is just amazing. The atmosphere is electrifying, it's just buzzing all night long. When you get there just have a walk round the different food stalls to see what you want to eat. You choose a table, all of which are numbered and give the table number to the stall holder and as soon as you have ordered and it's cooked,they bring it over to you. You will be asked by many stall holders to eat at their stall but you can tell them you are looking around and they will leave you alone, they are really friendly. When you have finished your food you can order some more and they bring it over, you pay at the end when you have finished. Our son didn't travel with us on this occasion and he was gutted that we were going to Newton Circus because he loved the food especially sweet and sour chicken. You can buy drink after drink from many stall holders. There are toilets available which are kept clean which is a nice change to some places you may travel. You can catch a taxi just outside the hawker centre. This is a must for anyone wanting to eat with the locals, I can't recommend it enough.
4
Very big food court with lots of stalls. However most of stalls sell the same food with same price. I'd say you have about 4-5 stalls that sell seafood, 4-5 that sell brochettes etc. very nice ambiance. Place is amazingly clean considering the number of people and size of the place. Beware of people at the entrance guiding you to a table. Since they are selling mostly the same food, they literally jump on you to sell you their menu. If you refuse to buy than start the insults...i cursed at the dude for being so impolite and on my way out he started the same manÃ¨ge with other tourists... Other than that enjoy the food!!
4
To get a really good experience of a Singapore food court, visit the Newton Hawker centre. I have been there a couple of times now and the food is good. I particularly like Mrs Tan at no.70, especially if you like seafood. The beers & drinks are supplied from next door. Word of warning...you will get inundated by people trying to sell you there food....don't accept the first person, take a good look.
4
A bit of the local food scene with lots of seafood dishes and a mix of beverages stalls.
A located a short walk away from the MRT and there's lots to choose from.
5
We spend our first evening in Singapore at Newton Hawker Centre, arrived by taxi and found a table. It was very busy with lots of activity going on. Tourists and locals all eating out and the lots of food choices. It was easy to purchase a variety of food and have it brought to the table and accompanied by a cold beer made it a fun night. Chili crab, noodles, skewers, curries, stir fry everything was available to order. Great night out.
5
Recently met up with a number of old school mates for a reunion in Singapore and we decided on having a street food night, Newton Circle came immediately to mind as it is fairly centrally located and is on the main MRT track through town. Arrived around 7pm, already quite busy with many already well advanced in their street food experience. You go around to various food stalls and order what you want, sometimes you need to pay there and then with others you pay when your dish gets delivered. Each table has a number so you best remember that when ordering otherwise you may wait a long time and go hungry. We had a great mixture of Indian and Chinese dishes along with a few plates of very nice chicken satay (always a must!) all washed down with a few Tigers and real coconut milk straight from the coconut. Prices were a little on the high side for street food, but it is a tourist attraction. A fun night was had by all and would certainly head back to Newton Circle next time I am in Singletree
4
I like to introduce my one of favorite chili crab restaurant.I like the chili taste. And I love to eat crab. So Chilli Crab is my best food.That's why I used to go there and eat chili crab even I am alone.This food is very reasonalbe price and also delicious.ANd Korea and Japan tourists come and eat in this restaurant.I truely recommend this restaurant
2
I have been going to Singapore for over 40 years and have always had a good opinion of the people and the food over the years, so much so that I suggested to my friend on her first visit to Singapore that we eat at Newton Hawker centre for dinner. I had a Thai meal which was lovely but my friend fell for the slick, smooth talk of the lady serving on stall number 70. As is normal you pay by the weight in seafood but I doubt that any stretch of the imagination could accept that one prawn cost $22 as the serving lady said it was 150 grms - firstly that was added up incorrectly and when we pointed that out to her she flew into a rage saying that my friend was getting it cheap, secondly that was the end of the service - no cutlery, no drink, no serviette and rude whispering behind my friend's back, plus having the fan moved from us to them. It was a particularly humid evening. I do not know if the owners of that stall realized how much their shop will be effected by a rude and aggressive employee but I do know that the owner next door to them was very apologetic to my friend over the rudeness of the employee in shop 70. A word to everyone - ask to watch when your prawn or other seafood is weighed and also make sure that the maths are correct when you get the bill and do not be afraid of speaking up if it is not right.  Would I go back again - probably not because I have been to a lot of hawker food areas in Singapore and I think that Newton has out priced itself for no good reason and unless you travel by train it is very difficult to get a taxi in that area
4
Had been to this place as it was recommended by several friends and found it really nice, I tried fish head curry (not remembering the stall name) and it was niceIf you are staying in Singapore for long then can mark this place as "to visit
4
Okay, this is basically another food hall, but as I have suggested previously I really do love these places, so when I got of the MRT at Newton to visit some place else (Sarkies Road) I decided to step in here and have a look around. Okay, I'm not sure if there is anything in Newton that would attract the average tourist (a category that I generally don't fall into) but the food hall is certainly worth a visit. There are plenty of stalls to chose from, though most of them were closed when I was here (which probably had something to do with the time of day). Still, there was enough available for me to partake in some of the goodies
5
We caught the train from Somerset MRT (Red Line to Jurong East), only two stops and a short walk to the food centre. There is a variety of Asian food available, please walk around and pick the food you wish to eat. We had Chilli Crab from stall 49 (Denmark), the food was very tasty and not expensive. Good value for money, a must visit place in Singapore
4
With a variety of Asian food on offer it's very hard not to find something not to like. It's a great experience too. It was my Thai girlfriend's first trip out of Thailand, even though she enjoyed the Char Siew pork rice and satay her day was made when we discovered a Thai food stall. All in all a good meal had and thoroughly recommended for first time visitors to Singapore
4
Singapore's food centres are always the right places for tourists to enjoy local cuisines. In my opinion, Newton is the best if you wish to taste all signature Singaporean dishes, ranging from satay to pepper crabs, from char kway meow to sting ray at one time. Once you enter the centre area, staff members from different stalls will approach you cordially. Just ignore them until you find a suitable one. After you have ordered a few dishes from that stall, you will then be 'free' to buy food from other stalls and you can enjoy a 'nuisance-free' dinner. P.S. There are always water basins around the corners, so you can feel free to savour the palatable seafood in Newton
4
The place crowded but fun, because you served with varieties of food, but the famous food here will be singapor carrot cakr and oyster cake. A must try place when you visit singapore
5
Have dined at Hawker #19 on two separate Singapore trips & the food & service is always spot on! Their Chilli Crab is delicious, messy & affordable!
The nearby drinks stall is always great, super fast & reasonably priced!
3
The location was great in relation to our hotel (Sheraton), however comparatively speaking, the food were ok at best as nothing stood out, and the highlight of the night was the Pale Ale.
4
We came to the Hawker Centre to enjoy a more authentic meal rather than sitting I a high end restaurant ... And we weren't disappointed. After the initial negotiating to get a table we got sorted. Having a range of food and restaurants available, once I ordered from the 'owner' who secured us a table, my husband was able to go off and order what he wanted without the same pressure/hassling. It didn't worry me as I was on a mission to have chilli crab - and it was all I hoped it would be. I was promised that it wasn't too hot - and the promised was fulfilled. The sauce had a bit of a bite, but not too much. The crab had been cracked allowing the sauce to soak through ... So the flavour came through as I sucked out the crab. The only problem was trying to clean myself up afterwards. Little tissues only served as a temporary measure until I could get more serious.Restaurant 43, in a corner with a yellow background is a good place to head! And the Indian next door looked good - and tasted fine according to my husband
5
Great Indian curries (or dozens of alternatives) and ice cold tiger beers (7.50 a large bottle). Fantastic experience. I don't have kids but observed the hawker staff being very friendly and accommodating to the families around me so would say this is a good option for young families.
5
Somewhat of a Singapore institution for travellers. A great overall experience of deciding and choosing what to eat and drink, together with great people watching. A great atmosphere. Filled with a good mix of locals, expats, business people out for dinner meetings and of course tourists.
4
If you are after an e prince of local food and cheap prices you can not go past Newtons Hawkers Markets in the evenings. There is a large selection of local foods. Do t be stressed out by the pressure of dome hawkers wanting you to sit at there tables to eat you can mix and match. Ethereal were 8 of us and we all got our meals and a couple of beers and soft drinks for $60 total there is a large variety to choice from, I found this to be one of the cheaper quality eateries in Si galore, a taxi should not cost you more then $20 from the central part of Singapore
4
Newton might have a reputation of being a more touristy hawker place but so long as you don't mind paying a few extra dollars it's a great place to go. Good selection of stalls (Indian palace is our fave) and they bring the dishes to your table. So no walking around and waiting for numerous different meals for the family. We like!
5
Having looked briefly at the overpriced breakfast at the Sheraton I walked across the street to get breakfast at the Newton Hawker Center. At that early time there were only a few stands open, among which a fruit/smoothie stand, a noodle and duck stand, a congee stand, and a drink stand. The noodle with duck chunks in a dark soup was spectacular. The coffee was the usual sweet milk Singapore coffee (no espresso makers here). The fruit fresh. The whole thing cost seven singapore dollars, the same as a cup of better coffee in the Sheraton dining room. Hawker centers are a unique (as far as I know) Singaporean feature, and I have never been disappointed. In Singapore I only go to restaurants for the ambience !
4
Newton Circus Hawker centre is unlike most of the others because it has lots of seating spread out in the centre of the Hawker stalls, that aside the food is the same as all of the others great Sate, Chilli Stingray, BBQ pork and lots of seafood brill

There's not as much selection of food as there used to be - more seafood but if that's what you're looking for, Newton Hawker Centre is great! Also, 24-hour Singaporean local food choice near town so very convenient for a late night snack!
4
This place is great. Must try the stall No 53. The sambal kangkong and BBQ stingray here is awesome. Especially their chili!!!! There are other decent food like carrot cake and XO noodle here as well. Satays and chicken wings are pretty much okay.
4
Having read reviews of the food here, we went along and wasn't disappointed to share an evening with Mrs Tan's attentiveness serving up wonderful food. So good, we'll return again and again.
3
While not how it was in it's hayday, the food quality and value are exceptional on different ends of the spectrum. Food is excellent and fresh but you could get the same dishes for 25% of the price from other more local hawkers. I would recommend this as a stop for tourists, but not a replacement for Little India or China Town. Be sure to wash down your meal with large Tiger

We were told the Newton Hawker market or Newton Food center was known for its seafood. We ate here twice for dinner and loved it. We tried chili crab, BBQ stingray, satay, garlic naan and craft (also draft) beer. We went one night at 6 and one at 7 pm. It really seemed to pick up during that hour. At 6 you have a choice of table but at 7, the temperature is cooling off, more stalls are open, our preferred time. The satay was 60 cents with a min of 10 satay. However, I was able to eat 20 satay alone! The chili crab was around $35SD and the BBQ stingray was $22SD. Both were very good. We were surprised by how much we liked the stingray. We weren't bothered by people trying to show us their menu. We just kept walking, grabbed a table and my husband went from stall to stall ordering for our family. We also at at Lau Pa Sat and Maxwell Hawker centers and this was my favorite
5
A few reviews we saw about this place suggested the food vendors were pushy. We didn't experience any of that. We were able to sit & determine what we wanted which consisted of mutabar, satay and beer (well it was Friday night) and we orders & received all in good time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thoroughly pleasant & filling experience.
5
A must visit for all whether you've been before in past years as I have in the 1980's or are new to it. Very good satay, Laksa, seafood etc and beer for $7 a big bottle of Tiger beer! Satay 60 cents a stick (minimum 10 sticks) and so tasty. Very good and very inexpensive in a city which isn't cheap
3
Food quality is good but most of the seafood stalls (for which Newton is known for) charge exorbitant prices because the centre is popular with tourists. It is near Orchard and regularly on the tourist 'must do' list.If you really want good seafood try the East coast seafood centre which has a better ambience and probably similar prices
4
Newton Food Centre also widely known in Singapore as Newton Circus is one of Singapore's more famous hawker centres, it is as popular with tourists as it is with locals. Home to seafood eateries and iconic hawkers like Kwee Heng and Hup Kee fried oyster omelette, While some may find the occasional food tout off-putting, it’s probably the only food centre where you can call ahead to reserve a table with your regular go-to seafood stall and have them attend to you. For beginners, don’t feel obligated to order from the hawker who got you a table, simply decline politely. If you are ordering seafood, watch them weigh it in front of you to avoid a surprise bill. Keep an eye out for the busy lunch crowds, happy family gatherings, and inebriated youngsters starving for some post-clubbing grub. It’s also common to see vendors touting all kinds of food, so walk right on by without making eye contact if you don’t want to be accosted. When you’re here, do order the famous chilli crab and barbecued seafood, and sample a veritable slew of other local delicacies. More than just a hawker centre, the variety of good food and unique atmosphere makes any meal at Newton an experience to remember. This is also a great place to people-watch. It is more expensive than other hawker centres but the atmosphere makes up for it

We went here at about 9:30pm last Thursday night and it was still pretty busy at that time. To get here you catch the MRT to Newton station, take the right hand exit and then turn left out of the station and over the bridge across the road.When you first walk in it can be a bit overwhelming, so I suggest just taking 5 minutes to do a lap of the place and get your bearings. you'll quickly figure out that a lot of the places are selling similar food. We ate at stall 70 (Mrs Tan) and the food was great (was nice to try stingray for the first time!). There is a beer stall next door where you can get some decent priced Tiger Beer and my wife really enjoyed the apple cider too.When dealing with Newton Circus you just need to be prepared to have the touts waving their menu's in your face, each one giving you the quick spiel as you walk past but just keep on walking until you find one you are comfortable with. We really enjoyed the experience and it was good to have a break from the expensive restaurants in the quays. We actually went back for an early lunch a couple of days later at midday on Saturday but most of the stalls were closed
5
A must visit place for seafood lovers visiting Singapore..... Located in the Famous Newton Hawker Centre is stall No.56
5
We love the newton circus its great food. So much variety, its not a restaurant to be clear but more like tiny restaurants in a food market atmosphere. You go past each one find the meal you like and you find a table and they bring it to you. They also have a variety of drink stalls. We found the food and drink here very affordable. We only paid $15 Singapore for 2 small meals and a small rice (pretty big portions) and $9.00 for beer (very cheap here). I would highly recommend just for the experienc
4
There are so many vendors from which to choose a massive amount of dishes. We had carrot cake, oyster omelette, sweet and sour and fried rice. All of the dishes offered different flavours, were quickly delivered to the table and of a high quality. Although our taxi driver suggested that it was more expensive and mainly pitched at tourists, we still enjoyed the experience
4
We were recommended to visit Newton Hawker Centre buy a people working at our hotel. After a 20 minute walk, our noses told us we had arrived!We were a bit overwhelmed when we arrived as there were so many options. In the end we had chilli crab and fried rice. It was really yum (and messy)!For a large chilli crab and fried rice for 2 it was around 50 Singapore Dollars. This did feel a bit expensive, but I guess it was crab, and everything else was cheap.Would definitely visit again
5
The Hawker Centres are an absolute must for eating out in Singapore, and Newton is our favourite. Located right next to the MRT. Don't expect a cheap meal, but do expect a memorable time with very good fresh food. Take a stroll around the various stalls to check what is on offer, place your order, and then find a seat. You will likely be sharing a table with complete strangers, but that is half the fun. The place gets busy every night, and with good reason. On this latest visit, we opted for Tiger Prawns, with fried rice, and steamed vegetables. The prawns were the size of English kippers (!!) seriously, so we restricted ourselves to 2 each. The stallholder will give you a price for these items before you order so you won't get a nasty surprise at the end of the meal. The prawns weighed in at 200-250 grams each, and cost S$16 each, (about £8 each). Not cheap but a terrific meal in a great location with an amazing ambience. Thoroughly recommended !
5
A great food Mecca for foodies!! Must try the real open grilled satay with their own homemade peanut sauce. And there was a Indian guy making the best paratha breads which is like between bread and puff pastry!! Would love to go back again some day!!
5
A bucket list eating experience! It's hot, sweaty, busy but the atmosphere and the food are incredible! Three meals, six drinks, £15. Made on the spot, fresh ingredients and right in front of you, there is something for everyone. Plastic tables and chairs, communal sitting areas, your place is marked by putting a packet of hankies (bring your own!) and putting at a table. Filled with local people, queues at each of the stalks, freshly squeezed juices, ice cold Tiger beer, and not a McDonalds or Nandos in sight! Bliss
5
Must do in Singapore. Try the bbq'd prawns (chilli sambal or garlic both fabulous) from Gina at Jian Fa they are huge and tasty. And delicious satays from numerous stalls,all great. Couple of beers from Thong Lai stall 41 and your set. Yum. Oh both these stalls give table service 
3
This is our 10th visit to Singapore and about our 8th to Newton. First time was when the stalls were makeshift with dirt floors. All modernised and clean now. We always go to #36 Michael, the stall owner with dyed hair, a different colour each time we visit. Usually he serves our choices (mine always Chilli crab) just perfectly. Not so this time. My crab was quite black, eggs and dead mens fingers still present in sauce. Meat too well cooked, so tough and legs dry. Sauce was just mushy. Everything now served on polystyrene plates, food goes cold quickly. First time ever I've left a lot uneaten. We ordered satay sticks first and they came after husbands main course, which was fried calamari. Looked a good portion on plate, but found much of it was deep fried onion rings.Can't help but think standard may be slipping as resting on good reputation of the past. Will have to think twice about returning on future visits to Singapore, especially when so many other centres are popping up with good food and good value
4
I ate at the pirates seafood, aiming for chilli crab. It was a big, juicy, delicious food. I ordered normal hot one, and it was almost sweet to me. If you're indonesian, 'saos padang' crab is much more tasty n spicy than this. The price is 5sgd/100 g for the crab. A very friendly n hopeful seller.This place is huge, you can find almost ant kinds of food here. Next time i go to sg, i will come here again for different food
3
Awesome carrot cake and pepper crab. Enjoyed the meals with family and friends. Quick service. Wish it was cleaner.
5
excellent food and innumerable choices! Right prices and open until late...chilled beer is always awesome
5
Most of the time I'm in Singapore I come over at Newton for dinner and I've never been disappointed! Cheap and good food with abundance of variety and the coldest beers in town! It can also be really fun if the stall owners/operators come sit with you! I'll always come back
4
Just you get out of Newton MRT station, you will find this eating place. A big complex where on all four sides small stalls sale all kind of food. Local, Malay, Indonesian, Japanese, Korien, Thai, Indian .... Soft drinks, beer, and water can be purchased with your food. Clean atmosphere, tasty food. Indian vegetarian food was also available here
4
Went here for an early lunch. A fair bit was closed but easily enough to make it difficult to choose. We had a spicy stingray, noodle dish, a buttery chicken. Cant remember everything but overall we were stuffed and very good food. The butter chciken was disappointing and we didnt ask the price before receiving the dish and paid far too much so ALWAYS negotiate beforehand if its not written on the board.
4
Access easy enough via MTR (as long as you come out of the station by the right exit!)Good variety of food, the main benefit being that you can order from one person, and he/she sources the food for you, so you do not have to visit loads of stalls.Make sure you pay for your drinks only once, as we had the feeling we had paid for them with the food, only to be presented with another bill
3
I visited Newton Hawker Center on 26th Feb and at 730pm, the car park was almost full and the parking attendant was making his rounds and issuing parking fines! Do note, they do not have a gantry system, so have your parking coupons ready!There are a lot of BBQ Seafood stalls in Newton and most of them sell the same stuff. Do note that though they tout and push each shop, every customer has the right to say NO! The touters get commission based on what they sell to you. To avoid getting cheated, pay upon ordering and INSIST so, else you might end up with a 3 digit bill at the end of your meal, with no explanation.Here's a review of the food we shared amongst 6 people.The Ocean BBQ #01-016 We just picked the stall we sat right next too, but I did notice that the stalls facing the inner circle seemed to be more popular. This ocean BBQ, is one of the outside stalls facing the car park.1. Lemon Chicken $15I loved lemon chicken and we ordered this. Expecting to be a thick chicken cutlet, I was surprised to see it served as fried cubed chicken. Some pieces were of the thigh meat, hence more flavourful, some pieces were breast meat and very dry. The sauce itself was decent, very lemony and you can taste the slight blend of honey. But I guess having cubed-sized chicken makes it easier for sharing.2. Sambal Singray $15My friend mentioned that the sambal was nice and it was! It was slightly sweet and for someone like me who doesn't eat spicy. This was the perfect sambal stingray for me! The stingray was meaty and the meat was easily separated from the bones. 3. Sambal SotongA similar sauce from the stingray was stir fried with the sotong, hence making the sotong abit sweet. The sotong tasted fresh and the serving was big enough for the 6 of us to share. Chances is, I might hit this stall up again, the next time I'm here. Definitely in love with their sambal!Bedok 85 Fried Oyster #01-0401. Oyster Omelette $5They were very generous with the oysters, The egg was crispy on the top layer, but on the bottom layer, it was soggy and was very mushy. I didn't quite like it in the end. If you want really good oyster omelette, try Kim Keat at Bradell.2. Carrot Cake White/black $4Even though their sign boards still says the carrot cakes are sold in $3 portions, They have increased their prices. The black had alot more egg and was sweet. The white wasn't crispy and tasted bland. Overall, another upsetting local dishKwang Huat #01-015 My friend was patiently waiting for this stall to open at 745pm! And at 730pm the owners were ready to take orders, but we didn't get our food till about 750pm.1. Hokkien Prawn Mee $5For $5, you get a satisfying plate of prawn mee with a lot of gravy, and 4 big prawns. The gravy is truly tasty and yummy. Although you can tell they did not use any lard, so it's missing that special taste. Some sotong and egg is what you get with the prawn mee, no three-layer pork meat either. I guess this stall is now muslim-friendly. 2. Char Kway Teow This was a rather OK dish at best. I couldn't taste the wok-hei and there were a lot of cockles and no other ingredients, there were like 2 slices of 50 cent coin sized fish cakes.. I do not like cockles, so I found this very upsetting. Char Kway teow to me is my most favourite dish in Singapore but I wouldn't come back here for this.Singa Cafe #01-014 Their sugar juice drinks are $1.50 and can drinks are priced at $1.50. Very reasonable pricingSoursop Juice $2I loved that their soursop juice was full of soursup meat. The drink was served with a plastic spoon, which you will need to scoop up the fruit.For those unknown to the benefits of soursop.Soursop contains a number of natural substances that have biological benefits such as, relieve stomach distress, fever, pain and respiratory problems such as cough and asthma.TKR #01-030 After walking around, we realized the prices were standard for the chicken wings $1.30 and 60cents per satay. We decided to go with TKR as it was a chinese stall, which meant they sold pork satay!1. Pork/chicken/mutton Satay 60 cents eachWe ordered 10 sticks of pork, 10 sticks of chicken and 10 sticks of mutton which added up to $18, and they gave us 5 bowls of satay sauce. The pork satay had alot of fats in them, which for me, I actually enjoyed. For the health conscious, you might want to just take the chicken sticks, which were more tender. The mutton was considerably drier than the chicken and pork, but it didn't have the weird smell. So I was okay with it.2. BBQ Chicken wings $1.30 eachThe chicken wings were pretty good. I enjoyed the crispy roasted skin. The meat was very juicy and I felt that for BBQ chicken wings, these weren't too oily and is a good choice for me! I've had BBQ chicken wings dripping with oil and that's usually the reason why I avoid them.They were presented very nicely on the styrofoam plate. They definitely gave some thought into presen

I visited here last year after being recommended to go by my cousin living there. We were taken to her favourite stall and the food was delicious. Being of ethnic origin we did get stared at, however because we knew what it was we wanted to eat and acted accordingly, we were not bothered by any other stalls. There were a total of 6 of us in our group and the food was plentiful and reasonably priced. I would definatly reccomend here if you want to try good local dishes
5
I went to Newton Hawkers for an early lunch and found that a lot of the stalls were closed. A lot of the store owners there try to get you to read their menus and hope that you will buy their food, but I went for the Chilli Crab at Modern Grill Seafood.The service there can be quite crass when you place the order, and it takes a little while for the crab to come out (about 15 minutes, despite the fact it wasn't very busy at all), but I really enjoyed it. The mud crab had lots of meat, great flavour and they give you a bowl of lemon water (and a heap of napkins) to wash your hands after. No utensils given, so you have to use your teeth and hands.The whole crab was $45 including the fried man tou (white buns) which came in ten. The whole thing was delicious! You get your hands pretty dirty though. We also got Iced Teh from Syed Ishak Teh Tarik stall, served by a lovely man! The drinks were fantastic. My sister also had prawn mee, which she really enjoyed.A great Hawkers Center, pretty authentic, nice outdoor area, adequetely clean and it has (like many Hawkers Centres) sinks just out the front to wash your hands in. A quick, convenient place to go for food

Last time we were in Singapore we visited the original Newton Circus hawker market. It was great food,great atmosphere and fantastic value for money. The new sanitised version is OK, but comes no where near the original. Food was advertised as very reasonable however when you ask for the bill it has shot up dramatically. We had; small rice, small noodles, large shrimp, chillie shrimp and spicy chicken. We expected about 75 to 80 Singapore dollars, it came in at 120??? No written bill and no explanation . Food is ok but you can eat better and cheaper in the city
1
It suppose to contain alot of local food, but that is for tourists.
And the price is cater for tourists too.
Head for hawker that most local will go, cheaper price but good food, examples are alexandra food market, brickworks market (ACB)
5
The concierge at the Sands said this is where Gordon Ramsay ventured for Pepper Mud Crab. Who I am to argue? If was awesome. About $40 bucks and thing was alive 1 minute and then in my belly the next.
4
The tourists discovered this place 45 years ago and its still a popular landmark in the Singapore dining scene. I always have the chilli crab from one of the stalls and the grilled prawns , some stir fried veg and I am set. I think the prices have gone from very cheap to really expensive comparatively and it is true you can now get the same thing at other hawker markets for much less . But this is the place to be 
4
Newton Hawker Centre has changed over the years and is now the main local hawker eating place for tourist. The car parking has always been a problem and now coaches arrive even bigger problem. The hawker stalls are really packed and as soon as you step inside their staff are showing you menu's showing you what you can eat showing you to tables near their stalls. You can buy almost any local dish; Chinese, Indian, Malay, and it all has that slight Western edge taste for the tourist. Prices are some what higher than the more local hawker centre's so I'd tend to go to them. Years ago there were a lot of cats around but now couldn't see any which was good. We ordered a selection of local dishes which were plentiful and good, the Tiger beer came in an ice bucket and were the large bottles. As you'd expect service was quick, as there were plenty of people waiting for tables
4
We caught the train to Newton and headed straight to Newton Circus for dinner. It wasn't how I remembered it 24 years ago, then it was packed, busy and cheap. Had a stroll around looking at what was on offer and came across stall No.70. We quickly ordered grilled prawn, sweet & sour chicken, stir fried water spinach and Singapore noodles. A cold tiger beer hit the spot on this steamy Singapore night. Our food arrived and the grilled prawn was so big, enough for 1 person, coated in a homemade chilli & garlic sauce, it was so yum. All our food was delicious and just enough to fill us. Ms Tan was lovely, as soon as she said "yummy yummy in my tummy" I knew we had chosen well. Look, like alot of others have said, it's not cheap, but it was good
4
Some years ago we lived very close to this hawker centre and called it our local. On a recent trip to Singapore this was the first place we went to once we had dropped our bags in the hotel. It has changed a little and prices have gone up, but we thoroughly enjoyed our meal of chilli stingray, oyster omelette and fried hokkien prawn mee, washed down with Tiger beer and fresh lime juice. We would have loved to have had more dishes but there was only two of us......Yum
5
Try the soft chilli crab! Amazing. Loved the food. Upon arrival can be a bit annoying with vendors trying to push their menu's onto them. Just ignore them and quickly find a suitable stall to buy from and once you have ordered, everyone ignores you pretty quickly. It's lovely to sit outside at night. Try the juice place and the natural cane sugar drink, delicious
5
This place is a must visit whilst in singapore, although slightly touristy now as meals are generally around $6-10 where your local hawker stands are closer to $3-5 per meal, it makes for a cleaner and nice environment from which to enjoy your food.The stall holder will shove menu's in your face as you walk past but this is Asia so you should expect this and be comfortable to just wave your hand and say no thank you. This is part of the atmosphere and I wouldn't have it any other way.A must try is the singapore Chilli Crab which will set you back around $35-$40 for a decent size crab and the fried buns $5 which are great for dipping into the sauce.Also of pretty good quality is the satay chicken sticks which are around $0.60-$0.70 each and come with home made satay sauce with actual crushed up nuts in it. This is an easy to eat family favourite, I would suggest that you need around 10 sticks per head to call this a meal or if it's a snack / entree then go for a mixed plate of them so you can enjoy the different types of meat.Another interesting dish that you won't find in too many other places is the stingray, which is extremely tasty
4
You MUST visit Newton Circus when you go to Singapore. It's an experience you'll get nowhere else in the world. Hundreds of stalls selling every imaginable food at reasonable (for tourists) prices. The atmosphere is amazing and you'll not be disappointed by the quality or choice of food. The only advice I can give is to go in pairs (at least), walk round first to see what you fancy eating, then one of you grab a table while the other orders from the stalls. This way, you'll not be looking for somewhere to site when you food is ready
4
I am not an expert on Hawker Centres like this but when three of us visited this centre for dinner during our stay in Singapore we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had visited this particular centre about 6 years ago and think it has improved considerably.We had a mixture of seafood dishes of crab, prawns and octopus and all were perfectly cooked and totally enjoyable at a price that we considered reasonable. No 82 was the stall we used and they were good and helpful. The market was clean and maintained that way while we were there.It was also a pleasant experience due to the fact that while the various stall holders touted for your business they were not overly pushy as you might expected from these places. When visiting Singapore in the future will happily pay this place a visit again
4
why would anyone else go to a hawker center if the food is not good? the food there is great, but it's a bit dark and could use a bit more lighting
4
Even as a local, I seldom come here to dine as its too touristy and expensive. You can get better quality at cheaper price elsewhere.But the centralized location and atmosphere is good, windy and spacious. Do take note of menu priced as $X/100 grams. These are usually those that rip you off. Or just make sure you ask and confirm the pricing before ordering. Now I see most of the stalls have changed the menu to a fixed pricing. What I've order:Sambal kangkong, fried honey baby squids, sambal stingray, satay, sugar cane juice, fried carrot cake, cereal prawns - total bill of approximately SGD$85 for two pax. Enjoy Singapore!
4
Good seafood and close to my hotel. Price is a bit hiked up due to it being a tourist hotspot nowadays. Stalls are plenty but most are selling same or similar items. Pick any stall and wont be dissapointed. Tips: walk back to Orchard was nice and so do-able
5
We made a point of returning to this location because we love the night atmosphere and buzz of activity. This is an open air market with many eating stalls and tables ands chairs in the middle. there is something food wise for all tastes, even a vegetarian like myself. The prices are so cheap, it's crazy. No need to worry about the standard of the food, all good. Just a short train ride to get there. Everyone should experience this once while in singapor
4
Especially for those who are in Singapore on an extremely tight schedule, Newton has always been the place to grab most of the local cuisines at one go. It can be overwhelming at times but I would recommend my friends to venture a little, look at what people order and order the same if it attracts you. Not overly pricey, one can easily be filled up with less than SGD$10 going for one dish items like Ba Chor Mee Pok, Chicken rice, Fried Hokkien mee. But go big a little and try the Sting Ray, my favourite (I always ask for chilli on the side)
5
We went there for lunch. We ordered chilli crab, cereal prawns, fried rice and fried buns which came to a total of SGD$65. Food was delicious. Very reasonable price compared to big restaurants which charge premium price (Over SGD$200 for the same meal).Definitely worth a try
3
Went for dinner one night on the recommendations of friends. It's outdoors and even at night is hot! You walk in and it is overwhelming there are so many food places!!! The second you sit down you are swamped with people giving you menus telling you to eat at their food stand which we didn't like, we wanted to walk around and browse before we chose but it was almost impossible with people heckling you!! The boys decided on Chilli crab, nasi goreng and chicken and rice which was amazing and not expensive compared to home! Chilli is put on everything so make sure you make it very clear if you don't want it, they won't remake a dish or give a refund! At least the whole coconuts with straws were a great respite from the heat.

If you are not careful you will be ripped off here by unscrupulous seafood stall holders. The one who took us for a ride was from Stall 23, Takara Grilled Seafood.It works like this: - Friendly host escorts you to a table and brings out his colourful menu. Most of the prices on the menu are reasonable. - He strongly recommends the grilled prawns, listed at $8 per 100 grams, and suggests two each is about right. You agree because it is a marketplace and everything else looks reasonable. - The prawns come, they are OK. - As soon as you finish them, he comes and whisks the platter away. So no evidence!! - When the bill comes, your prawns cost about $20 each (i.e. 250 grams), and you have no way of disproving it.Unfortunately this is one of those episodes where the mistake we made was trusting a friendly local person
5
We love Newton Circus, and ate here 3 nights out of a 5 night stay. The satay sticks and chicken wings from stall number 30 are delicious. Add a nice cold beer or juice from Michaels at number 29 a beautiful balmy night and what more could you want?? This is to me what a hawker centre should be and I love the atmosphere and vibe. This is something we just cannot get back home. I think the prices are reasonable. The only down side is some of the more aggressive touts, but just tell them politely to go away and that you will get your own table. Then you can freely look at all of the stalls. There is a good variety of food available. Can't wait to return
1
Unfortunately what could be a very pleasant outdoor-eating experience is ruined by the vendors. Expect to be hassled by various touts and then to be ripped off by them or a stall holder. If you choose anything with a marked price it is generally ok - although prices are no cheaper than restaurants - it is NOT street food prices. But if you choose anything by weight you will be ripped off big time. Go anywhere for street food, such as Adam Road, which is quite nearby. For seafood, head to the East Coast Seafood Centre.But avoid Newton Circus. Amazed the government haven't dome more to clean up the brazen thieves that run this place
1
We went here with family and the atmosphere and the sellers where unfriendly and pushy.
We settled for pretty bad and overprised laksa and not good at all meatballs.
Satay and Beer where OK
This place have no soul...
5
Best satays around. At Newton Hawker Centre there a many stalls that offer chicken, beef, and lamb satays, and I've tried most. But Satay Sedap (#67) is the best.
5
Was advised to try this place via family friend was not disappointed. Overall the food stalls had a good variety and choice but a few of the hawkers were a bit in your face. After wandering around to get the overall flavour we stumbled on stall 70. Were met by Ms Tan Kwee Gek who charmed us with her sales pitch. After telling us the menu we said we would check out some more stalls but would likely be back. Needless to say we were. We had outstanding tiger prawns with chilli and garlic, fried rice, crispy baby squid and complementary Asian greens The food was great with a beautiful chilli zing, the prawns whilst not cheap were simply to die for. The sales pitch was very good but the food more than lived up to it and actually outshone it. Be sure to take your business card as the lovely lady collects them and is very pleased to show you recommendations from previous clients. If you try the Newton Hawkers centre check out stall 70 and i trust you enjoy as much as wedid
1
Don't eat here. Many years ago it was affordable and the food was reasonable but now it's a rip off. Last night we had a small chili crab and a plate of vegetarian noodles together with a bottle of water and a coconut juice and it came to $60 for street food. Especially stay away from the lady at stall 46. there are many other places in Singapore worth spending your money at
3
The centre has a large variety of local cuisine - hawker food and seafood. However the food is slightly over priced compared with other hawker centres, and locals say the reason is due to tourists who frequent the place. We have tried a few different stalls and unfortunately, have not found any stall that provides really good-tasting food. Most food centres in the shopping malls provide better tasting food
4
We just had a delicious family lunch here amongst the locals of Singapore and I highly recommend you do that if in town. The closest MRT station is Newton and then a short walk from there. Here is what you do: you look around the whole centre and check out what meal you would like to eat, then you go back to the shop and order from the photo (small, medium or large), they range from $6 to $24 for a plate of cereal prawns, they are yummy, just make sure you ask to peel them first. The shop owner remembers you,tell them where you care sitting and then they bring the food to your table and you pay. We chose Mr Tan from Heng Heng BBQ stall 31 and he is very humble, calm and explains all the dishes without being pushy so I recommend if you want to eat at peace and enjoy local food, go to him. We also enjoyed a cold beer as the beer is very conducive and a good way to digest the food too. There are so many dishes to choose from, we picked the green veggies, cha keow tow, pad tai, cereal prawns and the satays.A tip: take a bacterial gel for your hands and some napkins or tissues. Choose any table under a fan and enjoy

If you aren't a local then be ready to be bombarded with hawker stand owners asking you to eat at their stand. We came for chili crab and we got a feast! We paid about 80 dollars for crab, fried rice and two jumbo shrimps. Not sure if that's cheap... But it was good! We ate at hawker stand 46.

In all my years of traveling to Singapore I have never been to a Hawker Centre. It's cheap eating that resembles a food court in an American Mall. I wish I had know about these before, as they could have saved me a whole lot of time and money. A huge variety of foods, that is served quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately we got duped into buying large prawns which were hugely expensive, so make sure you keep track of what you have ordered and the price you ordered it at. I would defiantly go back, time, and time again, but obviously have learned from my previous mistake. Great atmosphere, with locals, expats, and tourists

Went to the Newton (circus) food hawker centre.Pro's: Great atmosphere, lots of stalls to choose from, great satays and noodles, reasonable pricesCon's: Many touters for seats infront of there stalls to infer to eat from them. Prices reasonable but not cheap. If new to this it can be daunting of which stall to choose and confronting with the touting and some being pushy.Recommendations: Less hectic seating on the perimter than inside the middle plus you get any breeze/air. Less touting on the perimter.Try to choose a stall with a hygiene symbol of AWe were lucky that we sat and got advice from a local family.Our best food choices were the malaysian satays from #22 best satay stall on an end of the inside perimeter
3
The food is ok and more expensive that you would think, due to the vicinity and the amounts of tourist. However the experience is still worthwhile if you enjoy experiencing something different. A different style of life in a different culture. I enjoy the outside environment and the smells floating around the air. However, if you don't like to sweat and eat at the same time then this is not for you
4
VALUE FOR MONEY! Spoilt for choice. The street food is safe n hygienic. Cool place to catch up with friends for an informal eve of unashamed gluttony
4
great place to visit for authentic Singaporean cuisine and very cheap! All cooked fresh for you ...lots of locals eat there too so that's a good sign.
4
Nice open place with several options of food.
Big tables to share with other people.
I came on a Wednesday night and it's quite full of people.
Prices are a bit expensive comparing to similar food courts.
4
Returning after 30 years the place still has it's magicThe environment and food greatAs you walk in, you are plagued by hawkers trying to entice you to theirs tall.don't take the first choice, look around, we found stall 70 good value, , however they are all good value
1
Came back to Singapore after 20 years when I used to live across the street from Newton Circus. They have seriously destroyed everything that this hawker centre was. Not only is it unrecognizable, but the vendors are pushy. The atmosphere is stressful and uninviting. Go to Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown for a real hawker experience. Don't get trapped in to Newton Circus.
4
In Malaysia, we also have mutton soup but in this stall, the soup is red in colour and looks kinda creepy but damn it taste so good! There are also a lot varieties there such as korean, western, malaq and many more. Moreover it is very cheap so it's a good place to go if you lose a bet and had to treat your friends
5
We went here with friends who are living in Singapore and took us here. Wow, the atmosphere is awesome, the food is delicious, tasty and cheap. Make sure you try the stingray and carrot cake (not not actual carrot cake but made with eggs, some sort of dumpling thing, not sure what else but yum). It's authentic, local foods, service is excellent.
2
We visited newton circus as one of our colleagues wanted to see what had changed in 25 yrs. his last visit Was a buzzy , lively place and I thought the food was great , however three others had squid and suffered very badly the next day , I'd still go back as I had a great meal but disappointing three people were ill
4
My boyfriend's favorite food court when he works here. Lots of choices from seafood to noodles to indian cuisine. We had a small potion sting ray ($12), small black pepper crab ($32), a noodle ($10), indian pancake ($4), a beer and a coconut ($11). the place is outdoor. It's a bit smoky and hot, but would like to go back for the food again
5
Instead of eating at the well overpriced hotel restaurants I would go to Newton Circus_ a food hawker - as they are called locally. The variety of foods amazing! The prices range from cheap to reasonable. The Hawkers in Singapore are well regulated and licensed. Sanitation and cleaniness are not a problem through frequent inspection. I liked the atmosphere as well
5
we just love the assortment of food offered here. great place for dinner hang out after a day's walking tours
5
Food is good and cheap.
You can see lizards and enjoy local envirement.
It`s very easy to get here by tube.
Hawker centre is just beside the MRT station.
4
What a concept... how good would it be to have one of these at home!
Such a variety of food and at a very reasonable price.
People are so friendly and willing to prepare your food exactly how you would like...
4
A must visit when in Singapore. Tried the garlic prawns, Singapore chilli crab, satay, fried rice and the food was spectacular.
4
After skimming through several mixed reviews, i decided to go and experience Newton food center despite having my local friend said it's a "tourist trap".Once i'm there i was greeted by a throng of people. Luckily we got our seats after 5 minutes roaming around. We had chili stingray from the first stall at the entrance, bbq sotong at the stall that has a red LED, and oyster omelette from stall 28 (people say its the best).Price wise there might be cheaper hawker food centers but this one might be one of the most convenient (since its near the CBD), at least for tourists, anywa

Newtons was located just 2 mins walk from our holiday apartment (Orchard Scott's Residence), having read the mixed reviews on trip advisor we decided to give it a try on our first night in Singapore. The concept is really simple, choose a numbered table then order food from the many different stalls and have it delivered to that table number. The food was cheap, fresh and delicious. The first night we ate "inside" surrounded by the stalls, from then on we chose to sit outside close to the car park. The food was so good and the choices so varied we ended up eating from here most nights. Felt very happy to send our children to order for themselves, the stall holders got to know us and were very friendly. Paying at the table means your food is delivered promptly. Ask for cold drinks otherwise they may not be. Fresh fruit chopped to order was a lovely way to finish our meals. Try the sambal stingray, prawn noodle soup, Indian palace, and anything from the outside Thai stall. Despite the number of reviews stating you are hassled at your table we never found this to be the case. There was a polite one armed man selling wet wipe packs who stopped at each table but he was never rude and in fact we began to rely on him being there so we could buy off him. Cheap, cheerful and a great experience
5
Make sure you arrive early to bag a seat at this fabulous food market. Great fun to watch the locals collecting their takeaways for dinner! Each cabin prepares their own speciality and you just choose whatever takes your fancy. The food and drinks are fresh, plentiful an excellent value. You really are spoilt for choice. Everything from fresh seafood, satays, salads, exotic fruits and freshly made drinks

Really dislike this hawker center. One visit was enough for me, I won’t give it a second chance. There are so many amazingly wonderful hawker centers in Singapore, why anyone goes to Newton Circus is beyond my comprehension. You get accosted with pesky hagglers the second you arrive, the tables have warnings about not ordering from the individuals haggling you but to order directly at the stall instead. This sort of says it all. Newton Circus is a generally unpleasant place because of these people. Lau Pa Sat satay evenings has a slight bit of this same scene but they leave you alone after one attempt, and the overall vibe is enjoyable and hectic and manageable. At Newton Circus, there is nothing enjoyable at all about the persistent hecklers who are there, it feels like, to exploit the tourist element. As to the quality of the food, I can’t even comment because I couldn’t wait to leave. Thankfully I have tons of other fantastic choices for hawker food, I am not missing anything by opting out of this one
3
 Very different to 15 years ago when it was relaxed and cheap food. This time it felt hustled. Rushed to a table and seemingly forced to order in a rush. The food was very expensive and average quality. We got poor value because we looked like tourists, which is a bad thing here now
4
We met up with some friends who live in singapore for dinner and they took us here, it was amazing we arrived and a man found a table for the four of us, once establishing what we ate our mate ordered some tiger beers with glasses and ice and then went off to order our food coming back to the table we sat and talked then all of a sudden food started appearing at our table from all the different stalls she went to, it was amazing and so much fun
4
great chili crab and the girl who was waiting on us was super friendly and non pushy. she actually spent time talking with us.the lady from stall 75 selling drinks was super cute and kept giving us napkins to keep clean.the market itself was super busy and lots of people trying to get your attention
4
i was there with a group of 6 friends. had bbq squids,stingray,tiger prawns at $15 each.very fresh indeed.huge ones.total bill $200 plus.onlyi bypassed stall 46..due to the negative review..but was lucky i settled on stall 50.met alan,the friendly macho guy holding the menu. i am now his regular. bringing my overseas friends/clients often to support him
2
The hawker centre was busy on a wet Friday night and had limited 'free seating' as most tables were for diners of a certain stall. 46 said we could order from other places so that suited our group. We had no complaints about the food: string ray, chili crab, 4 prawns and fried rice. The menu indicated prices but we were not asked or advised to the reality. $8.00 per 100 g it said but they claimed $80 for 4 prawns- $20 a prawn!!! Served with plastic plates and forks. I'm sure they were not over 200 g per prawn. It's too hard when they have been eaten. We asked for a small serve of the sting ray but were charged for the large. We also asked for a small crab and that was $40. That didn't seem too bad but to hand over $60 per head for a meal on plastic plates, wet ground and tables seemed a real rip off. Tourists beware. Ask for proof and cost.
4
It was a little confusing at first where to eat but by walking around and seeing which places appeared to be busier than others we managed to find a seafood place.It was an experience to 'choose' our crab and then have it delivered to us! The chill crab was delicious; the soup was just right in consistency and chilliness and was complimented by some fried rice. We then had some traditional tea to end our lovely meal. We did find it value for money because we saw chilli crab advertised outside the centre and it was a lot more expensive than what we paid for
4
Some Singaporean friends warned me that is is a tourist attraction and may be a tourist trap, but I went to try it anyway. Read some reviews from TA that booth no A1 is an honest vendor, and tried Fried Rice from A1. Huge portion of fried rice (medium size) S$ 8, and I just managed to ate 1/2, took the rest away. I guess small portion (S$ 5) should be enough.Tried Omellete Oyster from other booth but this this tasted so-so, as the oyster is still 'wet' and felt slightly undercooked. Didn't manage to try Ah-Heng carrot cake as it was closed. There were some touts, but you can just say no politely and they were not pushy. Go to this place if you want to try many varieties of Singapore food, the price is fair as many starts from S$ 5

Perhaps one of the more famous of the Singapore Hawker Centres.Its a large outdoor area with over 40 small specialized food outlets.Food choices is very Singaporean/Asian.It gets very busy after 6 p.m. and may be difficult to find seats.Food is good, perhaps more expensive than most of the Hawker Centres.There are waiters/drink servers who will bring the food and drinks,but they also try and seat you in their areas-so be minful of a little pressure from this aspect.You could eat for $8.00 and if you have lobster be mindful that its priced on weight.Its also an attraction for travellers as well.You can get there by exiting at the Newton MRT station and walking across overhead pedway.Food is generally good.Children may not enjoy it if they are not familiar with the food choices.Good place to hang out with friends.Beer is reasonably priced
4
We went there for chilly crabs and we were so glad we did ! The seafood is pretty pricey, so don't forget to ask how much it cost and confirm the price as some of the hawkers will increase the price to take advantage of the tourists. The table next to us had some locals were very kindly ordered and negotiated the cost for us...we were very thankful for their assistance. Enjoy your chilly crabs with fresh young coconut juice....refreshing! We will go back on our next visit
4
We went there on my husbands business trip to Singapore - I went with him and we combined it with a holiday. One evening we had to go to dinner with his company, and they decided that I had to see this very typical Singapore place with all the different things to eat. We ordered a lot of different food and shared it. I recommend this place - and you'll find your favorite food in one of all the small shops
4
A friend of mine took me here when I last visited. The set up is fun - you can work your way around trying different dishes from different food stalls, or just chill out at by one stall. A few bottles of Tiger and you're away. Great atmosphere and a great thing to do for an evening during a visit to Singapore. These hawker stall areas are in a number of areas I think, it is just that this is the particular one I went to
1
2 years ago we were warned not to go to Newton Hawker Centre as it is a tourist trap. Previous years we had fantastic chilly crab. On the previous trip we could not go to the centre so we went this time. The chilly crab was a watered down tomato paste with a little chilly taste. The crab we chose was also not the same crab when it arrived. Previous years you got a receipt when you ordered your food and you paid straight away. Not this time. When we got the bill, they increased the amount. When we queried it, they got very aggressive. We refused to pay the amount. In the one corner of our table was a telephone no you phone if you feel done in. I started to phone that no and only then they started to change their attitude. We paid a lesser amount but still more than we were supposed to pay. BE WARNED and stay away.
4
Ah Newton Center after doing the more expensive tourist for show restaurants on one of the Quay's, Newtons is the place to go for good eating at a reasonable cost. Nothing fancy here just good food and cold beers that you can afford.
5
I recently returned from a three week stay in Singapore and ate at Newton Food Centre four times. On two occasions I ate at Ms Tan' (Stall 70) - I had some fabulous huge butter prawns on one occasion and the fabulous black pepper crab on another. Together with some greens and some rice it came to around 40 SGD each time. If you want cheaper then there are many stalls doing Char Kwai Teow etc for 7 or so SDG. I also had a couple of beers from a stall nearby which must be one of the cheapest on the island at 7.5 SGD for a bigger 660ml bottle of tiger. On the other two occasions I ate at the Indian (around stall 40 I think) and had a fabulous keema each time. Again washed down with a big bottle of Tiger. Yes, there are people trying to tempt you as you walk in the entrance but this is Singapore so it is hardly in your face! If you are a new comer I suggest walking around grabbing a table (under cover if rain is in the offing) then ordering a beer. Each of your party can then choose where they would like to eat
4
Food at Newton was great, very fresh, cheap and plenty of it. There is seating in the open and undercover and is great for families with plenty of room for the kids to run around. We would recommend the famous chilli crab from Tay at Takara Grilled Seafood, Stall 74
5
We were recommended this by a taxi driver who we asked to take us to East Coast. 15 minutes later with a list of what to ask for and how to ask we were dropped off and entered the centre. Its an outdoor hexagon shaped area with seating in the middle and under cover. Probably around 30 restaurants selling seafood and satay etc. We had the chilli crab 38 Singapore dollars and BBQ stingray 18 dollars which was a first and absolutely delicious. Tiger beer must be the cheapest in town 7 dollars for a big bottle. You eat of plastic plates with plastic cutlery, but its an experience that makes a difference and you should try as an alternative or as well as the big seafood places. You won't be sorry. We went as a family of 4 including 5 and 2 year olds and all had a great time

My husband and I decided to go to Newtons Circus for local cheap food for dinner while in Singapore tonight. I had a $5 meal, and he decided to have the garlic prawns recommended by a nice little old lady saying "hmm yum yum". On presentation it looked fantastic. Looked more like lobster than prawns. Four of them. When it came to paying we thought she was saying $16 for prawns and fried rice. Turns out it was $16 for EACH prawn making a grand total of $64!!!!!!! Apparently they go by weight......so when ordering garlic prawns (yum yum), ask the price FIRST! Not the cheapest meal ever :
4
We have been to Newton Circus many times and it never fails to disappoint. It is always clean and bustling with locals and tourists (although seems to be more locals which must be a good sign of the quality). This time (March 2014) we had chilli crab, Asian greens and Mee Goreng noodles from Mrs Tan in shop 70. Delicious
4
When Am in Singapore always indent to visit Newton food court, its one my best choice for Seafood and drinks. Chili or Pepper crab is my first choice, Satay and oyster omelette are my another choice. I love to eat... Yummy foods. Please visit once you be there in Singapore
3
For vegetarians, it is a worst place to go. It smells like hell and I eat non-veg stuff pretty frequently, and still I couldn't stand the smells. The look and feel is of course, third world and not clean as per Singapore standards. If you want a cheap eat and can stand smells, go for it. Otherwise, skip it
3
There are so many stalls to choose from so you have to look around to make sure you pick the right one. After you order and pay, the food will be delivered to your table (you have to get a table first and note down the table no.) Food here is OK so-so but what you get is the variety and the experience of being in a hawker-centre environment. Plus it's cheap! Worth a visit
4
You have to try a hawkers market when in Singapore. Take your time to look around, and then let one of the "hawkers" help you out. Portions are generous, and going from a small to medium raises the price a lot. We ordered too much for three of us, and had to leave a lot on the table. "The Pirate's Table" served a very tasty crispy squid dish -- dinner candy! Get some vegetables -- they are delicious. You eat outdoors at concrete tables and off of paper plates. Bring your own napkins and enjoy an Erdinger beer with your dinner.
5
Show my Scottish friends some local delights. They seem to enjoy the BBQ Stink Ray a lots. Not to forget the Tiger Beers. Will definitely be back here for more seafood and beers.
2
Same food everywhere, and not impressive. They are just not delicious. Good thing about Singapore hawker centres are they are very clean, but I dislike them using many non-recyclable materials, which in long term it is bad for the environment.
4
They are a little pushy, just take your time deciding what you want.
Had the following and it was all great
Stingray with bbq sauce
Mi Goreng
Singaporean Chili Crab
Chicken and beef satays
Chicken Wings
4
Order the fried shrimp with egg floss & barbeque chicken wings - they are nicely done in this place. We were lucky that it was a nice cool night but don't go there during rainy season.
4
Had a great time at this place. Too many choices and lots of repetition from food stall to food stall but the food is local and incredible. You've got to try the chili crab and giant prawns. Wow! Simply incredible.
3
9 out of 10 times when I hop on a taxi and ask the driver to bring me to a hawker centre, they would recommend Newton Circus. Later I found out why from my Singaporean friends - (i) for tourists, this place can't go too wrong - it is big, with different varieties of food; and (ii) the driver can always pick up someone from there. It's actually not bad, but the food is more expensive than other hawker centres, and especially for seafood, the menu has no fixed price and if you're not a local, you'll certainly be ripped off. There are a lot of local hawker centres. You just need to ask your Singaporean friends, not taxi drivers
5
We ate at Maxwell in Chinatown, Tekka in Little lndia, but Newton was my favouite. The eating area is larger, there were sinks for washing your hands and so much variety. We had excellent Indian food, Malay, Chinese soup and juices (we were a group of 7). Luckily it was also still hopping when we arrived at 10 pm from our transfer from Malaysia. Strongly recommended.
4
This place is amazing - if a little touristy. You have to give it a go! Lots and lots of stalls serving everything from fish dishes, curries, to milky tea and ice- cream. Grab a table, get a number, choose from as many stalls as you wish and the food will be brought to your stone table. Everything is outside and the atmosphere is fantastic. Really good fun
4
Ate here twice. All the food was tasty. (Chilli Stingray not our favourite but we gave it a go). Lots of different choices, nice place to sit and easy to get to. (Take red line train to Newton and follow the signs). Prices were quite reasonable. I would recommend the indian in the corner. (garlic naan and masala curry was spicy and delicious
4
This was recommended to us and we were greatly relieved to find that the taxi driver knew where it was. He gave us advice, which we heeded, on eating at one of the outer layer of stalls. We talked to locals and visitors, asking them what they were eating, what they recommended etc and ordered some dishes from different stalls to share. They were all freshly cooked and very tasty. The value for money was incredible , the atmosphere was great as was the opportunity to talk to lots of different people about the food that they liked and we enjoyed it so much, we returned to sample more on a second night
5
Fantastic place to dine along with locals. There are several shops with the similar menu. Chilli crab is very tasty. Bargaining is essential especially for crab dishes. Bill for 2 with drinks ~50SGD
3
This was on my first day in Singapore - went there due to a recommendation and ordered the fish head curry because she never lets me down. Fabulous!!!!!The only downside was that when we went it was almost empty. Granted it was a Sunday around noon - I didn't think ahead about the time of day. It would have been nice to see it busy with all the venders open
4
A friend took us here for BBQ stingray. It came with a spicy sauce but was delicious. We rounded it out with fried rice and green vegetables. You'll be greeted upon entry by a hawker who will direct you to their stall tables but you can buy from anyone
4
I used to go to Newton Circus when it was a hawker centre in the middle of a roundabout. It was great! Then they moved it to the 'sanitized' permanent location it is in now and I felt it was a tourist trap of the worst possible type. I had avoided it for years and the then took someone who was in Singapor efor the first time there so they could see it...it was all I feared. But this visit was different - greatly improved - local folk as well as tourists (always a good sign). The food was excellent, touts trying to get you into their particular stalls wer enot too agressive so walk round at leats once and dont forget there is an 'outside row' as wel
3
As others have said, the food is not particularly a good value, and we seem to have gotten mild food poisoning. This in a city where it is very hard to find bad food. However, the experience of haggling for food and then sitting outside while sharing long tables with locals and visitors alike might be to your liking. We found it an interesting experience but will not return
4
Met up with friends for a meal on a warm December evening. Warned beforehand that it was very touristy but the majority of people eating looked like locals. Presented with a laminated menu with pictures of the dishes, chose garlic prawns which were enormous and delicious, beef in black pepper sauce - delicious, chicken murtabak - brilliant and fried rice. Complete with beers came to less than Â£15 per head. Very good value and an interesting experience
5
Delicious authentic food, true delicious fast food! Read all the tips and reviews before and felt ready to order appropriately when we went with our 2 kids. Was advised by a stall owner not to walk around and haggle over price, had also read this before. Headed straight to Mrs Tan at stall 70. What a gem. Ordered plenty under her recommendation but not ridiculous. Absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere. Going back tomorrow.

We got into Singapore from Australia as a stop over on the way to London and decided to sample the 'must-do' things in Singapore on our short visit. We had heard that sampling the chilli crab from one of the bigger hawker centres is well worth it, so we asked our concierge which is the best place, and were advised to try Newton, as another popular centre is undergoing refurbishment.We arrived and were pleasantly surprised that the "aggressive selling" that we had been warned about was not the case - apparently there has been a crackdown on this. People will encourage you, gently, to read their menu, but to be honest, I was expecting and almost disappointed to not have to engage in friendly banter and got the feeling the stall owners were holding back due to the new rules.We walked around for 20 minutes and eventually selected a stall, spoke with the owner and ordered the crab. It was ok (we have high standards), and we finished it, paid and left feeling happy. The middle of the night saw an end to that! I have never been so ill, and my wife was almost as bad. I won't bore you with the gory details but needless to say we were violently ill for 2 days with acute gastroenteritis, and almost unable to get our flight to London. We saw a doctor and I was close to being admitted to hospital due to dangerous dehydration (what a nightmare that would have been!).In short, be very careful before deciding to eat here. It's worth seeing one of the markets, but maybe better to get a sealed, commercially produced drink from one of the vendors rather than risk what we went through - it was just awful and ruined our trip to Singapore, as we spent the entire time running between bed and bathroom.As an aside, we stayed in the Mandarin Oriental, who could not have been better. Apart from it being a stunning hotel, the staff went out of their way to assist us during our illness, and gave us a late checkout of 8pm on the day of departure so we could go straight from bed to the airport. I look forward to going back to Singapore, and staying in the Mandarin Oriental again, but will most likely give the hawker centres a miss next time
4
You can get good and local food but there.It has probably more than a hundred food stalls there so you have a lot to choose from.But dont make the same mistake as us and go there for lunch. A lot of the stalls will still be closed by then since people go therer for dinner
4
This hawker centre seems pretty famous, especially among tourists. At dinnertime, maybe 50% of the customers are Caucasian. The food is highly varied from seafood to cuisines of all different cultures, but the price is probably almost double that you would find in other hawker centres. I've had some pretty terrible seafood there, and my Singaporean friends tell me that the seafood there is not particularly good but worth a try I guess. The non-seafood dishes I've had there are very good through, and the difference of a few dollars I'm not too fussed over. Overall definitely worth a try
4
plenty of stalls to choose from. don't get intimidated by those who approach you. you can sit anywhere and order from anywhere. must try oyster omelet, stingray (tastes like tuna), chili crab, bakuteh, well almost everything is good!
4
Recently had a meal at Newton hawker centre. Store 70 was the best. A must for service and quality. We could not fault the meal, plus we ordered food from another stall which they work together, this made for a memorable meal.
5
If you head to shop 66 for the best chilli stingray, I always go back there to Stanley when I'm in town. Love this with a nice cold beer! Its really just a local outside food court with the best chilli stinray.
3
We visited Newton Hawker Centre around 2.30pm on afternoon for a late-ish lunch. We arrived in the pouring rain to unfortunately find about 60% of the 'stalls' closed for business. We did however manage to find some hianese chicken as well as some fresh indian food, both which were very tasty and resonably priced. In saying this, prices were no substanically cheaper than some seemingly more 'upmakret' offerings in ION Orchard etc, however we understand the food at Newton was probably more authentic and more true to the Hawker experience.Was the food good? Yes. Was the value and atmosphere amazing? Not really. Would it have been better if all the stores were open? For sure.Would drop back in if passing by but would definately check out some other Hawker Centres first
3
Newton hawker centre is definitely worth a look, & the food was good without being exceptional, we had stingray, 2 king prawns, sweet & sour chicken, 9 chicken wings, seafood fried rice & 4 tiger beers.Total cost $160.00, & that was after arguing with the vender & getting a $10 discount. We won't be back @ those prices
5
When you go for a hawker style diner. you wont expect to get good service usually hawkers just give u want u ask for and mind their own business not here. when asked for a cold beer they gave me frozen beer which is extremely amazing to have at this warm climate at $7 for 640ml... who wants to leave..... the food all around is all great. though they have their sections cut out each respective stall has its own area.. i go here every month a universal place for every occasion.
5
Absolute a brilliant find that is easy from the MRT at Orchard and one stop away. you just need to follow the roundabout road to go over a walking fly over to reach it.Every trade stall holder was so astonished that you had arrived there and boost about their chef talents.. Best tasting fish ever!!! and in some case paid no more than the equivalent one pound for a meal....
4
This hawker centre was close to our hotel and had been recommended by an expat friend. We found out from local colleagues that it tends to get better reviews from expats than locals who don't think it's as good as other hawker centres in Singapore. For us it was convenient but also had great seafood dishes that were very reasonably priced. It was clean and had a really vibrant atmosphere. It's also open until late at night - some stalls stay open 24/7. Worth a visit
4
Been living here for the last 2 years and have found this place to be close to food from home!A great ambiance and superb sevice , Mohan who is the owner knows how to make you come back for more ! A must visit place for Indians in singapore :

We ate here twice as it was close to our hotel, just a short walk from Newton MRT station. The first night we were silly and let one of the stall holders show us to a table and pressure us into ordering way to much food as well as garlic tiger prawns which although absolutely amazing, almost doubled our bill!! The next night, after reading up on how to do it properly, we chose a table then went up to order dishes from various stalls. This way you get exactly what you want and know exactly how much you owe! A nice mix of tourists and locals eating, which is always a good sign!
2
I wish the hawkers focus on the quality and taste of their products. It not exactly sheep to eat here, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired. V disappointed, especially to some brought up in Malaysia and Melbourne
2
The food seller is pretty aggressive and annoying, not like any other hawker center.
The food price is a bot high, maybe it is because there're too many advertising promoting this place, so they tend to put higher price for their food.

Some seagood is sold by weight so be aware for lobster & tiger prawns, otherwise price known before ordering. Mrs Tan will do gluten free sauces or hold on the side, no-one else understood our request. Yummy, quality fresh fish. Search carefully as some venders don't have the same quality (frozen). Walked from the Royal Plaza (fantastic) on Scotts. Great local experience..
4
Silly little me got a bit carried away and forgot to ask for the total before ordering our food. The bill was double what we should have been paying so please be careful as the stall owners are trying to pull a fast one on tourists. But in saying this we took our time and picked the food we wanted to eat, it was delicious, well cooked and full of flavour. We had Black Pepper King Prawns and Chilli Sqiud plus a couple of mammoth Tiger beers. I still enjoyed the experience even tho we were swindled for a few extra dollars. Fair play! Hah

Looking for a traditional Singapore dish on our last night in Singapore we took a taxi to Newton food market. The place was packed full of locals and tourists. We were soon shown to a table by one of the over eager stall owners touting for business. We ordered Singapore chilli crab and Hainanese Chicken and was not disappointed. The crab was fresh hot and spicy with the contrast of chicken mild and moist We had a selection of noodles, rice ,vegetables and Tiger beer total bill came to 60 Singapore dollars. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Singapore and enjoyed the atmosphere and found the locals in Singapore very friendly and polite.

a good place to visit if you like to mingle with and eat like the locals. there is plenty of choice, however, be prepared to be pressured into buying from particular vendors. I guess that's why they call it a hawkers centre. you cannot walk 5 feet without being approached to eat at their food stall. a good and vibrant atmosphere and worth the visit if not just for the experience
3
The food was good but not great. I liked the chili crab but Im sure I could have had a better version of it somewhere else. Its really hard to know exactly which stall will have the best food. The Chicken Rice I had was not good at all. We had better food at the satay stands close to Lau Pa Sat (closed for 2 more months apparently). I liked Makansutra better to be honest
4
I'm staying at Singapore and hardly dine at Newton Food Center since it's notorious for overcharging. However, the coach that I took returning from Malaysia stopped at Newton, I decided to settle for a quick dinner. The last time I came here was years ago...My 1st impression was touting is so rampant here, something that is so rare in Singapore.My advice for visitors, especially tourist from overseas, DO NOT settle for the 1st stall owner who manage to find you a seat. You are absolutely free to sit anywhere and order from any stall.I also realise that those who were touting are all the seafood stalls holder. From my observation over an hour there, many tourist actually ordered only seafood from the stall holder who found them a vacant table and gave many other nice food a miss since they didn't even walk around the food center.Please walk around and choose other food as well besides seafood, which is way overcharged at Newton Food Center and does not really taste good
4
I first discovered this hawker centre the first time I came to Singapore and it's still just as good value and has such a wide variety of food as it ever had! Just a short walk from the Newton MRT station! Thoroughly recommended to all visitors to Singapore
4
Visited Singapore 4 times in the last 4 years and every single time have stopped for a meal at Newton circus. Nearly all the hawkers sell the same food, however i go towards the ones that sell more seafood. Fried rice, Prawns , even the veggies are fabulous. Open till quite late , fun to sit outside with the place being always crowded. Decently priced as well. Must eat here atleast once when you visit singapor
5
clean, convenient location, non offensive /aggressive barkers, over all good choice, Not sure if true but we were told this is only open at night
5
Asked a local cab driver to take us to somewhere to eat good crab, and he bought us to the Newton Hawker Centre. After being hassled by several very pushy restaurant touters, we started speaking to San from Denmark Seafood who was friendly, polite & great to deal with.We had chilli crab, black pepper crab, tiger prawns that are bigger than your hand & some greens, and a few tiger beers for good measure. We left full & satisfied, and for a lot less than we paid at no signboard seafood the night before
5
Yes I know the locals will say its not authentic enough and way too pricey! But it must do something right when it's been here for decades and still one gets an excellent meal for good prices. My recent visit happened on a Friday night, filled with families and friends all feasting on crabs, lobsters, shells and the typical local fair. Each stall will bring the food to you, which is what I love about street food here, one doesn't need to navigate the crowds to find a seat and then try to not spill your food. We had giant grilled prawns, a round of satay and vegetables. Tasted great and the along with the atmosphere a must for not only those living here but the tourist as well. For the tourists have no fear, it's clean, all B ratings, friendly and has bathroom amenities too
4
If you want to try out some authentic food of Singapore, this is the place to be. This is quite famous for being there for decades now, and I first found out about it from my dad who went there in the 1990s. I've been there twice, each of my two SG stay. It is like a giant outdoor foodcourt where tourists and locals alike eat and drink. Owners will enthusiastically call and encourage you to buy from their booths as you pass by them. However, we were stopped by a local owner who called out that were Filipinos, and continuously said "Masarap alimango" (translation: delicious crab). We were taken to a table, followed by the food owner with it's graphic menu and detailed prices. This made us communicate with each other easier. We wanted something else not on the menu, so he referred us to his co-seller. The food would be delivered to our table, and we had to pay up immediately. What we ate: Cereal Prawns, Chicken and Pork Satay, Chinese-cooked Cabbage, and Yang Chow Fried Rice. (During my first visit, we ordered Chili Crabs and Lemon Chicken). Overall, it was a good experience as we savored our food up to the last bite. We spent around 10 sgd each.The only thing I'd like to comment is that it's quite tricky going there using the MRT or Bus. Make sure to memorize the bus numbers or train station you'd get off to
3
Good place to try out local fare if you stay near orchard. . The fish soup near to the Carpark is great. The rest you can get around the same standard at a cheaper price elsewhere. Be careful of ordering seafood. Got some experiences of rip off by the hawkers there.
4
Excellent local food! Cheap if you don't mind the ambience. Beers are extremely cheap! Had a local Tiger beer and a Heineken and still had money in my pants!!!! Try the sambal stingray.... I know, sounds strange but its awesome! a little bit spicy but what the hey
4
Experience a little atmosphere in a tourist-safe area. Try some dishes without breaking the bank. Hawkers from individual stands will try to convince you to eat in their booth, but be patient and walk around until you see something that interests you. Hawkers are assertive but not aggressive. Be sure to establish the price as you order, not afterward. Dont rely on the posted price
4
Loads of local food here, but many repeats among the vendors. Find a place and go back. Vendors will remember you and give you great service next time. Be careful about the seafood prices. Veggies and chicken are inexpensive here, but many of the seafood items can be quite pricey. You may enjoy a few jumbo tiger prawns then find out that plate cost $50. Discuss with the vendor beforehand so you aren't surprised.We particularly enjoyed sugar cane juice with lime or lemon from the juice stands, to go with our food. Great place
4
We went with locals, were met by people keen for you to eat their food. Good humoured and not pushy. Order your food, give them your table number and your food arrives pretty promptly having been freshly prepared. Great calamari, garlic prawns, vegetables and rice. Naan and dhaal.Locals definitely are here plus a handful of tourists
5
If you are looking for where the locals go to eat - try Newton Circus - train to Newton Circus walk to the overpass and there is it - one of the biggest selection of food hawker shops available in Singapore. Try Chili or Pepper crab - choose your own live crab - butter prawns or the grilled Malaysian sting ray. YUM YUM YUM
5
good food with varieties to choose from. have to check the price before you order any seafood items or it might turn out to be a little over your budget.
4
The best part of this hawker center is that they close late. They have the main singaporean delights, really clean and nice setting.
3
Seafood very fresh but be careful that you get what you pay for. Some hawkers will try to sell you over priced seafood so make sure they weigh it in front of your eyes as you pay per 100 gramms.
4
every stall got a tasty favours that make us go again and again. the only problem is that they don't have tissues for the customers.
thanks alot for the very nice food.
5
after a late night out the best place to grab a wholesome meal is right here, the food is amazing and you get a wide variety, at 2.30 am the place was very busy, we stuck to simple food, fried rice, prata, sweet and sour chicken and nasi gorang all in 20$ amazin
4
We ate here twice, with our 3 children. Had amazing mee goreng and murtabak. So cheap, cost $20 to feed our whole family. You need to ignore the tauters, the stall owners are not supposed to approach you with menus but some do. We didn't find it too busy but we were there by 6.30pm, if you eat later it can get very busy.
1
Everyone will tell you that this is a FAMOUS place to eat local food in Singapore. I've lived here 13 years and the place always gives me the creeps and makes me feel cheated by the aggressive hawkers selling their expensive seafood. The only time I ever go there is if I'm stuck in the neighborhood at lunch time and have no other option. If anyone were to invite me to a group party there in the future...I'd pass
4
Even if people complain that the the newton hawker center is overpriced, touristy, etc, etc... One can't deny that it is convenient to get to and is quite near orchard road. It is still reasonable but like any other similar eating places around the world, you should watch your bill and what you are paying for.Just went during the day with a lot of stalls closed. To get the full experience, it is recommended to go in the evening 7pm onwards. Ended up eating and getting my favorite stingray and sambal kangkong in stall 53. It was very good, decently priced, and surprisingly - the owners were very nice and friendly! Also left my bag in front of their stall and the female owner was nice enough to see it and hold it for me.No matter what people say, the convenience of newton circle for me is the main draw
4
You must experience this hawker centre on your visit to Singapore, it is truly unique and pleasantly surprised at the range of foods, cultural differences mixing with the locals. We avoided rush hour and had a late lunch around 2:30pm, no the queues! We had the fried kway Tao a Singaporean speciality, the chicken rice was to melt in your mouth, the satays fresh and tasty, roti with peanut sauce, the vegetables so green! All washed down with a cold icy tiger beer, you need this! Thoroughly recommend you do this, we are doing it again. Take tissues to mark your table and wipes for cleaning afterwards. There are ceiling fans but its all in the open air. It cost us sgd$15 per head including a large beer
5
I've been going to Newton since 1977 when I began going to a school in the area, and it's still my hawker centre of choice when I return from my new home in Melbourne.It may be slightly more expensive than other more-local hawker centres, but it offers a great array of choice and the food is generally of very good quality. Singaporeans will sometimes complain of quality on the basis that locals often look for 'best of breed' in dishes, and Newton may not have a replica of "mum's lamb roast". Having said that, as far as I am concerned Bee Heng Popiah and Heng Carrot Cake (try the white version with chilli) are outstanding, and the best of their kind in Singapore. Wash those dishes down with sugar can juice and it'll cost you $10-15 at most and put a wide smile on your face.Is it touristy (as is the occasional complaint)? All of Singapore is, and not more so at Newton. In fact, it's typically filled with locals until about 10pm, when more tourists start filing in.Newton has never disappointed me (except when my favourite stalls are closed! - I think on Tuesdays). Don't miss it
1
Rude and pushy vendors ...late night fights and very very pricy...they only want to sell large BBQ overpriced prawns ....AVOID !!!!
4
Easy to get to (walking distance from Orchard Scotts residences where we were staying), and with many options for local street food. Cheap and cheerful, but with friendly service - a number of the vendors remembered us after only one or two visits.
3
The food here is not bad, there are many choices around but it seems to be centred towards seafood. Be warned though, the seafood stall people will definitely pester you to order from their stalls. Be firm.
5
A very relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere at this clean food centre. Food is inexpensive and delicious!! Particularly the chicken murtabak.
5
This place is buzzing, plenty of choices and cooked fresh, we were told to get price of food before buying to make sure not to pay too much. But we had no problems
4
Just be careful - always ask for prices first before ordering!! We spent quite a hefty bill normally spent on 5* restaurant.. But the food was absolutely delicious
3
The food here is nice, but for a Hawker Centre it is overpriced as they know many tourists come here. You can also find better food at a cheaper price in other Hawkers.
4
I used to live around the corner form newton circus hawker center - I've probably eaten here 100 timesEnter on the bukit timah rd entrance and walk along the outside and right before the end you can turn in on your left - dont turn in but sit down there as there's a great juice stand and next door is the seafood place where you should order1) bbq sting ray2) satay but you have to walk in and find a malaysian satay stand as their satay is always tastier than the thai/chinese/indian stands as they use a better marinade3) try the oyster omlette something different but a must try if you're in singapore4) the locals say try chicken rice i think its the most overated local cuisine ive ever tried same with the chili crab a local delicacy - i would stay clear of both of them5) get a chicken fried rice 6) get a bak choy or stir fry beans to go with the sting ray and rice and satay (beef/chicken/venison get 6 of each to try
4
Take the MRT, and walk the rest of the way â€“ it's totally worth it. The food and drinks are excellent and cheap. You get a sense of the local culture at Newton Circus. I always cherish opportunities like this whenever I travel - a chance to interact with the locals on their turf.Mind you, being a foreigner, you will get harassed by the hawkers to try their stall over their neighbours. Other reviews dwelled a bit much on the pushiness of the people. It's not as bad as they make it sound
5
I first ate here a few years back with a friend and I loved the wide variety and the taste of the food in spite of the then crude appearance of the place.This time, I came back with my husband, kids and a small group of close friends and was pleasantly surprised. The place had been renovated, and very well, I must say. The food stalls are now at the periphery and the tables are in a central open-air area. It encourages socializing.Upon entering, one is assaulted by all kinds of delicious smells. Of course we knew that it would be impossible to order everything but we certainly tried--crabs, fish, chicken, squid, oysters, pork, beef, mixed satay and shellfish. The food was not fast but was well-prepared.There was no one trying to hurry us up. We were able to catch up uninterrupted. The only drawback to the evening really was the heat. Summer. Unfortunately, no electric fans in the open air part. But the food and the ambiance made one willing to sweat it out. So my previous memories of great food have now been reinforced with more memories of great food AND ambiance. Newton will definitely be on our itinerary the next time we're in Singapore
1
If you want a hawker experience go somewhere else- La Pau Sat, Chinatown, Tiong Bahru but not Newton. You get pushed into buying very overpriced food, it's not a normal hawker experience.
3
Like:Close to orchard Scotts
Disliked: too many approach from staff to buy food in certain stall.
Too crowded in some nights.
3
1) The ambience does not seem the same , after the renovation
2)Some stalls still over-charging.
3)Choices of stalls variety seem to be down
3
There are almost 100 diffent talls all selling much the same food. I was told that this was cheaper and a lot more local Singaporeans ran this up until a few years ago. The food is still good but beware of the prices. Ask price before you order or you will get ripped off. Our meal for three with prawns, BBQ Stingray and Chilli Crab was $128.0
3
Used to be very good and cheap a few years back I don't mind the touting after all it's an open air hawker food centre and that's what you will get ! Definitely over priced for such small portions and the old Newton circus hawker center many years ago was much better but I must say the food is still delicious . Better find somewhere more affordable next time
5
Yes it is usually hot and humid, and by no means a high dining experience, but the chili crab is to die for (approx 30-35 SGD for a whole crab) and it is always great food. Very family friendly, and wallet friendly too. Always try the fresh lime juice to wash it all down
2
We were warned about the inflated prices, but were still happy to try the experience . Very disappointing, the food was average and not as good or at least no better than food we had eaten at other hawker centres, including those within shopping malls. The harassment from vendors was relentless and made it hard to browse the food stalls. The prices were much too high for the size & quality of the food we had, definitely would not go back or recommen
4
Hawker areas which frequent Singapore are great places to enjoy the local cuisine in a relaxed outdoor atmosphere. Newton Circus is only a short walk from the Newton MTR station. One word of caution – the food in hawkers is generally very reasonably priced except the large prawns and the chili crabs – Singapore specialities. All food is a stated fixed price except these items which are by weight. Make sure if you want these items, you ask for them to be weighed in front of you and ask what the total price will be. Many unsuspecting customers have been shocked by bills totalling several hundred dollars when they thought they were having a “cheap” meal. It is common for the weights to be exaggerated if you are not careful and have the items weighed in front of you. Do not let this detract from trying one of these areas though as everything else is really cheap and the food is amazing
2
we went for a quick family dinner and having lived in Singapore for many years we feel quite "local", but here we were treated like fresh off the airplane foreigners and the prices quoted for fish and seafood were way beyond what market price is elsewhere. Vist for the experience but take care
3
It used to be one of the best places to eat at in Singapore and my family often frequent there but much has changed. Not every stall that you go to serve you good local food. You've to be wiser and more selective now. I recall the Thai food stall there is one of the best.
4
hot and spices Ikan Bakar and lala, I like. too many variety sometime don't know what to eat, but is a nice place to go.Why Singapore Seafood so expensive....
3
The seafood here is mostly good, but you will pay more here than you would at another food centre as many tourist are brought here.
4
I like the food.... but some might not like the rush atmosphere. But its a good experience and different kind of taste compared to many other places.
4
Fish Ball Noodles and Roasted Chicken Wing are awesome. When ordering BBQ seafood, best you ask for the price before ordering.
3
The hawker centre at Newton Circus badly needed and received a renovation. It it well-known by the tourist crowd. It is not heavily frequented by the locals, as there are much better hawker centres around the island.
3
Many staffs, different kind of foods, near ochard area , expensive and mainly for tourist! Different staffs with different standards. You must ask how much the price especially for sea food stalls. Some times cost a lot because the charge by weight , like fish , prawn , crab and etc.If the stall is long queue , normally , the food is nice!So, open your eye to observe, your nose to smell,.. and may ask your friends! Enoyed your food !!!! Good luck :-} Su
3
Regarded as a tourist venue with 'expensive' hawker food, for most visitors it will be more than a worthwhile visit and not deemed expensive. It has certainly become more ' established' than when last there some twenty two years ago.There are plenty of other hawker venues that are more authentic and cheaper...but was happy to go with friends who had never been
3
After many years of eating at Newton circus, we just don't anymore. It has become far too expensive. It is a shame that it has become so commercial and expensive. We might try again soon, but at this stage it is not going to be for quite some time
2
The fact that I lived a 10-minute walk away from this establishment but only visited the place 5 times in 6 years tells you all you need to know. Let's start with the good. It's spacious, ventilated, clean, you're spoilt for choice and there's a nice buzz about the place. Now for the not-so-good. If you're a food snob, there are other tastier places to go to for local food - way better. Secondly, the harrassment you receive from the hawker stall assistants can be frustrating. There are strict rules about touting at Newton and i tend to look the at my options from afar so as to not be pressured into making a decision. Next the price. Be aware, that Newton is a pricey neighbourhood just a stone's throw from Orchard Road. As such stall rentals are expensive and need to be covered. So expect to pay more for your food. Watch out for the seafood prices. Most locals won't go to Newton for the seafood so I would advice that you double check the price for prawns/crabs etc before placing your order. Lastly taxis can be a challenge to find when you're done eating/drinking so do be prepared to take the train/bus
2
Good food stalls wouldn't park themselves here. Everyone here is out to make a big buck from innocent tourists. They had a renovation few years ago to spruce their image, but in the process much of the good food has run away from the obscene rentals. Only came here with a foreign friend who insisted on trying. He became receptive to my recommendations at other places after that meal
5
I visit the food court once a month or so. Love the spread and ambience. Best dish so far: BBQ StingRay.
4
The selection of food was great and the prices were very reasonable. All the stalls were extremely clean and hygienic!
5
This was where we eat the first night in SG, it was a nice experience, though it is a hawker center its clean, and food is great. The place is just near Newton station, exit A...
3
I am old enough to remember the good old days in Singapore when mobile food stalls were wheeled into places at night and set up in a hive of activity to provide a range of good quality, cheap and delicious varieties of dishes that you could watch being cooked, and virtually without tourists so you got the real deal at rock bottom prices. The one at the Cold Store Car Park off Orchard Road was my favourite (if anybody can remember that far back!). Alas such itinerant food stalls no longer exist, all being now confined (on the grounds of hygiene) to a permanent stalls at fixed locations such as the Newton Hawker Centre– this being one of the largest. Oh well, all good things change over time, but I have to say that it is not as good as the old transient stalls.Having said that it is an interesting experience for the uninitiated, although it has become too touristy and not as good as some other, less tourist-orientated food centres – much better food can be had in Chinatown. Nevertheless, if you want to go for the experience then there are some good dishes to be found, although they do vary. My advice would be to walk around firstly to decide what you want, ignoring the blandishments of the stall owners who try to entice you to sit at their table. Probably 75-80% offer the same things, but some offer different or specialist dishes. Also, remember you don’t have to eat everything from the same stall, as if you fancy something from another stall then order it and they will bring it to you – but do ensure you make it clear to them where you are sitting (and best not to pick something from too far away, although if you don’t pay for it until it’s delivered they will find you!). If you want to eat all dishes at the same time, then ensure you get the timing of your order right if ordering from different stalls (order from the furthest stall first)It’s also worth noting that the Newton Centre is not particularly convenient for walking or public transport, and although taxis are cheap and easy to find to take you there early on, they are not so easy to get to go home later in the evening as most that turn up have been pre-booked. It is possible to flag one down on the adjacent main road, but you may have to wait a while before a free one passes, so you might consider ordering a taxi in advance to take you home and avoid much frustrating waving at taxis when all you want is to return to your hotel room
4
Good place to hanging out & try local delicacy. But be prepare of the hot, smokey, busy & noisy situation.I was pretty disturbed with all the stall staff which tried to promote their menu and sometime pushy. Try the sting-ray fish (I can't remember which stall), but I try two different stall & both taste good. I must be lucky.There's stall named Indian Palace which totally match to my taste. I always afraid to try Indian food because of the heavy spices & bad aftertaste. This one taste mild but so good & pretty authentic, it still leave a spice aftertaste, but not as bad as I thought
4
We revisited Newtons Circus after my first visit 25 years ago and I went to re taste my initial dish from then - the Mutton Murtabak . I found it and was not disappointed . Cold Beers Hawker Food on only 1 watch salesman!!! Gotta love Singapor
2
i visited this brothel of an eatery several times in years gone by and vowed i would not return. however i did, with three friends who were visiting singapore and insisted they must visit newton circus. alas nothing has changed except the prices - now more ludicrous than ever - definition of 'market price' is the maximum that the food seller feels he can rip the customer off without provoking violence (at which point local 'helpers' insist you pay your bill). food was average, service aggressive, and prices high. as many posters have said, there are many less expensive and, frankly, better hawker centers - try maxwell road, the food street in chinatown, farrer road, or even go out to changi village
4
This is a classic touristy place in Singapore but that doesn't mean all the stalls serve touristy food. I lived in Singapore for two years and have visited other times and still enjoy the experience here because I can get all the food I want in one location. I would steer clear of the seafood as there are better places to get it but the carrot cake, Kway Teow, and Chicken Wings are all good. I also like the big area and that they deliver to your table. This is a good place for a tourist to wet their appetites but beware of price and quality
2
Newton Hawker centre is an overpriced tourist trap, particularly the stalls selling seafood. You can get food of the same or better quality at lower prices at any of the hawker centers in Singapore. The stalls on the edge, away from where the tourists normally go are much better value. If you want the atmosphere, and the seafood than Long Beach at Dempsey is better (although it is also a bit of a tourist trap) whereas if you want the Hawker experience than Lau Pa Sat has a wider variety at proper price
5
While holidaying in Singapore we took our friends to the Newton Hawker Centre as this was their first visit. They were amazed if not a little cautious at what was on offer. We picked a stall and feasted on a variety of dishes from king prawns (they had never seen ones so big), a mixture of satay and some other tasty dishes. They said it was the best meal they had ever had. We were looked after so well. We know we paid far more than what the locals would but we realised that being tourists they were likely to put their prices up. When comparing it with what you would pay in Australian dollars we were still very happy and would still go back again. An experience worth having and no, none of us got sick, for those who are apprehensive about eating at these places
3
Worth the try but a bit pricey compare to other locals hawker centre. Good to go there once for the experience.
1
Most of the food here is over-rated, though I find the Muslim food pretty good. If you are in thsi area, why not try the Adam Rd Food Centre, which has better choice of local food but with better prices.
5
My favourite place for Sting Ray. Like many of the Hawker Centres in Singapore the seating is basic but oh the food! Get a taste of how the locals dine out. :-)
3
Mainly an evening night experience for tourists ... there are better places ...... Beware of seafood prices check beforehand
2
Newton hawker centre and Boat Quay must have shared the same founder. Head down to East Coast hawker for a better deal and better view.
3
NIce spread of local food, but for foreigners, please beware of the cheaters there, who tend to hike up their charges when they sense tourist presence. Make sure you ask the price before ordering!
5
Most of ma friends says the food now is not as great as how it used to be..
I still like the food there..great Seafood!
5
Having a great selection of foods you will not be disappointed!My favourite being the Chilli Stingray, and sweet chinese buns! I was brought here by friends from Singapore and they tell me that it is the best food. There are other hawker stalls and other places you can get the same dishes - but you can get everything here and eat all at one table!Top tip - make sure you shop around, a lot of stalls sell similar foods so make sure you ask the price before you commit!
4
If you're looking to experience a wide range of seafood, then Newton Hawker Centre is the place to go. So many stalls offering a great selection of seafood. The prawns and satays are definitely a must. I would recommend having a look around all the stalls before you decide what and where you want to get the food from. Be aware of people coming up to you asking if you need a table etc - once you say yes, they'll show you to a table then hang around getting you to order food with them. It got a little annoying after a while. You shouldn't really have trouble finding a table so it's probably easier to order the food yourself (just know your table number before you order food because generally the stall vendors will tell you they will bring the food to you). Overall it was a very enjoyable night and I definitely preferred Newton to Lau Pa Sat
3
Going to a hawker centre like this can be a daunting exprience, knowing you will be attacked by people trying to get you to sit and order food with them, but a trip to Singapore should include a visit to this for the experience. The food also is usually excellent - and unless one orders something very special, one can have a delicious meal and be very surprised at how little they paid at the end of the meal.
5
Great atmosphere, food was fresh and quick.
BYO available.
The staff were helpful and informative.
ATMs on site.
Good toilet facilities.
Easy to access by MRT, taxi and bus.
2
Nothing much. Despite the recommendations to go there for the food, I do not get the attraction simple because for that price and the kind of food, I can get it at other hawker centres at better price and similar taste
3
...and we lived in Singapore so long and everybody is talking about it, so we went. Well...ok.....by far not the as good and cost effective and nice as others. ...and we heard that real Singaporeans would not go there either. May be good for tourists?
3
Std Hawer food, will not travel there as a Singaporean. There are other places with similar food, better taste and more reasonable price
3
One of the many outstanding Hawker centres that Singapore has. A nice way of getting to know Singaporean and in general Asean food. This place is very popular so you have to be early and taking a taxi is preferred.
5
Yes it's the 'touristy' place, but also mobbed by locals, hell pay a little more and you'll still enjoy it.
Chilli Stingray especially good. Poh Pia too
3
Didnt like the way they all jump on you to eat at there stall, no other Centres do this and I think they chase tourist away with this pushy attitude, not nice for ladies to be jumped upon like this, food experience was not as good as other Centre
4
We went for an evening meal here courtesy of a local Singaporean couple who we had met several times over the years. We had never eaten at a Hawkers Market away from Orchard road. The food was wonderful, our hosts treated us to a selection of local dishes in this bustling location. I would visit again on our own but would not have been too confident going there for the first time without local company. I didn't know most of the dishes and there are touts who try to push menus, if I had been alone I would have thought they were waiters of some sort! Be firm and a bit wary of being taken advantage of and it is a great place with great food. The fruit stalls on the outer rim of the Market were incredible, selection, quality and quantity - on our next visit it is firmly on our list of places to eat
3
We arrived approximately 1500 to find only about 10% of the store were open for business, luckily we found michaels little shop who provided us sting ray, calamari, prawns and chili mud crab. All of the above we're cooked we'll and tasted fantastic, with bags of flavour. Value was not fantastic but service was very helpful.Not a bad place to visit, just come in the evening when every thing is open
4
I have visited several times over the years. The food is still excellent. Take time to wander around before making your selection and don't buy everything from one stall. Particulary recommend the satay from a small stall in the far corner (near the loos).Large bottles of Tiger beer were selling for S$6-50 each - great value when compared to the S$15 to S$18 per pint chargred by many of the bars
5
Always love Newton for seafood. Will always have the bbq stingray, boiled gong gong, cockles and chilli crab whenever we are there. And they have halal-certified stalls. Luv luv!!
3
Certain stalls are good but the place is a tourist attraction so prices are overall more expensive than other hawker centres.
4
Real Singapore Hawker experience, large with many varieties of cuisine, it can be hard to make a choice. Food is all affordable and tasty and casual.
2
There are only a couple of stalls at the Newton Hawker centre that I would patronize....the Malay rice stall ( Nasi Padang ) and the Duck Noodle stall. All the other stalls are over priced and not that great in terms of food quality.
4
Probably 70 stalls selling fresh seafood can't be beat. Butter Prawns, pepper crab, grilled tiger prawns, the list goes on. If you don't like seafood probably not the place for you.
1
So many much better places to eat local food without the rudeness of the vendors,overpricing and often poor food quality.............Singapore hawker food can be brilliant but generally not here.This is where you go if you are using an outdated guidebook. Try Lau Pa Sat instead.
4
This place has turned into a place for tourists. It used to be one of the premier places to go for hawker stall experiences but now, the costs are up there and it seems to be all tourists. Which is ok. But I live here and there are just too many places that are similar that don't cost anywhere near the same. (Chinatown for one). The food is good and you get decent service but.. well, there are other places to go. If you do want to go and see it.. go in the afternoon or very early evening to miss the crowds.
3
Newton circus used to be the go-to place for Singaporean suppers, but there are so many other options available now![Alfresco/Outdoors]1. Chomp Chomp Food Centre (at Serangoon Gardens) Accessible by public transport, but any self-respecting taxi driver will be able to bring you there. Small, only open from 6pm. It has the best BBQ stingray in town. 2. East Coast Lagoon Food CentreAt the end of east coast. Great place if you were planning to visit East Coast Park.3. Glutton's BayStarted by a famous food critic, , he brought together the best of Singapore tastes in one convenient spott (beside the Esplanade). Also opens till late, this is my favourite supper spot after catching a show at the Esplanade or Marina Bay Sands theatre. 4. Food Republic Beer GardenIn the footsteps of Glutton's Bay, this newly opened makan place is right beside St James Power Station, which is a great stop after a day at Sentosa. [Air-conditioned]All-time favourite: Food Republic at Wisma Atria. It has all the yummy local food like fried Hokkein mee and carrot cake. The more expensive sister brand is Food Opera, B4 of Ion Orchard
4
The place is a little pricey compared to other Hawker Cennters in Singapore and reputation recently blemished by overcharging foreign visitors. However, I still think you get the best food varities here and quality are very good. It shouldn't be missed by any overseas visitor and make sure you check the prices before ordering.
1
The food is expensive and not even that good by local standards. Tourist trap! Please avoid going to this place if possible. Hawker food in singapore is really much cheaper and better tasting at other places. One of the main draws of this place might be that it is open till late at night. But there are other alternatives available
1
Touting is prohibited but there are many ways you could be harass. The most expense outdoor food centre in the city. The Tourist Promotion is the biggest culprit. They should not call this lemon an apple.
5
The diversity of the hawker ambient is unique. Price of the food is more expensive than a regular hawker, however the superb variety and food quality offered by the hawkers gave Newton a deserving and accliamed reputation.
5
Great food, when you arrive a 'helper' attaches himself to you, he then finds you a table, a menu, drinks and brings back what ever you want! Great experience and a bit different as well
5
must eat 1st class indonesia barracuda fish slices in soup,seafood carrot cake and oyster egg omelette , excellent chineses bbq satay and also malay satay
5
Not sure why people do not like newton circus/food center. Great atmosphere, my wife & I have been going here for over 20 years. You can buy cheaper food I agree at food courts, but they are so bland & the cleaning is very dubious. When entering, do not sit where the first person tells you to sit, just walk around looking & what is available. Be polite they are trying to run a business in a competitive market. Normally you get 3 serve sizes to choose from. We have only ever had seafood, eg prawns on a couple of occasions, as that is expensive, but if you want tiger prawns, ask them to weigh in front of you. Garlic style is the best. My favorite is Mr Lee at stall number 46. Pepper beef. Calamari was OK but the batter was a bit thick. In the end we had 4 choices that cost $65 sg.Ice cold tiger beer @ $6.50 for a large bottle
3
I go there all the time because it's close to where I stay. The food there are nice, such as chicken rice, Hokkien noodles, satay, and seafood. But since the seafood price don't show on menu, they charge tourists more. Make sure you compare the price before you order!!!! I am serious
1
This is a disgusting place to eat due to heat, humidity, poor hygiene and dishonesty.Store vendor # 49 pestered us to eat there and after circulating the food court once and being hounded by store vendors with what is essentially the same menu, we settled down at #49. Instantly the affiliated drink vendor requested that we order from him and so two coconut juices were bought for S$6. The crab was supposedly 900 grams and was quite tasty in Singaporean chilli sauce. When asked how much in total, the owner suddenly could not converse in English. The next dish two tiger prawns in garlic sauce were dry and bland. We dipped it in the sauce of the crab dish. The oily fried rice was equally bland and also had to be drenched in chilli sauce.Whilst dining, owner of #49 calculated on a napkin and when the bill for S$100 arrived we requested for a receipt. The receipt arrived five minutes later with the description “seafood dinner”. We asked for some descriptions and five minutes later abbreviations and prices were made available on the receipt. We took photographs of the complaints number to call but never managed to call. Would it have made any difference? Surely we were not the first customers to be cheated. After all that chilli we had some crushed ice desserts which was cooling and escaped the place
1
From the moment you arrive you are pestered by store owners desperate for you to try their chilli crab or swordfish. Each store holder will try to convince you that the tables near their store are theirs (which obviously they aren't) and force you to sit with one of their menus.The food is overpriced and available much more cheaply elsewhere. It's quality is dubious and generally much lower than what you will find a Food Repulic or Kopitan in a shopping centre.I believe the problem with Newton Circus is that green tourists staying in Orchard Road hear about it and head there where they are easily manipulated into paying through the nose for second rate food.My advice: get on the MRT to Raffles Place and head to Lau Pa Sat Pavillion. Cheaper, better and far more authentic
2
Be very careful when ordering seafood of any kind as they price it by weight per 100 Grams. This can turn out very expensive if you do not insist on the cost beforehand. We have not been back since we took friends over 2 years ago. One the up side the FRESH juice outlets are excellent value
3
We bring guests there when they come if it is a short visit - lots to eat in one location. But the stall hawkers can be really aggressive (for one who lives there) and the prices astonishing. Plus all of the high school aged kids drinking while still in school uniforms is off-puttin
1
Overly priced just because it is a famous tourist spot. Total rip off for very very average food. Most hawker centers in singapore have better food and way cheaper.
3
Food there is pricey compared to other hawker centres, very tourist type of place....
Will prefer to go to Whampoa hawker centre or Maxwell market
1
After buying a plate of very average grilled prawns i almost had to take out a second mortgage on my house to pay for them, try La Pasat better value
3
The foods there are not so good and expensive. Selfdom go there but also not bad for lunch and dinner. Beer are a must with friend's
3
Hawker Food and price for tourists and foreigners and visitors to Singapore. Much better at other Hawker Centers.
4
If you want to feel the vibe of being in Singapore, this is a nice place to visit especially for the first timers. Just choose a restaurant and sit down nearby, and the staff will come to you with a menu and all. You pay to the staff directly after every order
5
One of the food stalls is a very delicious and cooked very well.You must try at stall no. 46 the JIAN FA SEAFOOD BBQ. Very excellent food. Specially the steamed fish is the best, also you must try the crunchy cuttlefish and stirfry kang kong. And sure you come back..
4
Almost everday we going to Newton Hawker Centre after work... well well this a place we need to go chill out after work!.. after all long tired day this is the best place to chill with work mates! the food was good too no doubt 
3
This place was great 15 years ago but today, it is just another hawker centre. With so many newer food courts in town and in almost all shopping malls, Newton Hawker Centre has lost its appeal. Today it is spacious and fairly clean, with lots of seating and parking available. But I agree with the other reviewers that there is not a lot of choice as every hawker seems to be offering the same dishes. If you're in the area and need a meal, by all means visit Newton Hawker Centre. But it is not worth going out of your way to have a meal there. Just make sure you check on the price of the dish you want to order first to avoid problems later on
4
This is a must visit. Great food and a wonderful atmosphere. Lots of choice, worth a wonder round to see everything on offer. Pick a table, then go buy your drinks and food. Top tip: agree a price before ordering anything priced on weight. Try the chili crab, peppered squid, and the jumbo prawns
4
Great variety of seafood choices but be sure to at least have a good indication of the prices. Hawkers at Newton Hawker Centre is well trained in tricking tourists into expensive dishes or ridiculous price calculations. A seafood meal for two should not exceed SGD$60.
2
it is generally a rip off place and prices are beyond almost any other hawker centres in Singapore. Gives tourists a bad impression of Singapore.
3
actually there's a few nice food stall there but becos of the servers it price we paid is not the food we order, like a $15 sgd BBQ stingray we order it would be replace by a $10-$12 stingray. so?cheated.
3
an assortment of local foods... watch out for the prices... ask for the price before purchasing...the place gets crowded in the night but the food is not that great...
4
This was a fun and easy night with our guests from Australia. Food was great and atmosphere was good too
5
We loved it all especially the variety of dishes and the very very cold beer to wash it all down. An absolute must for all travellers to Singapore or rest assured you will feel that you have missed out on a spectacular culinary experience.
2
The food was as expected (good) but the stall owner were a hassle - and confusion remaed about the pricing.
3
Went to this food centre yesterday for dinner. spacious open space, not so smoky but once you stepped in the area, there will be a few people help you to look for empty tables and they'll bug you after that with their food menu. It's good for their service but frankly speaking i don't like to be forced to order their food because of that. Food was okay, could say that every stall cooks same types of food, a bit pricy. Overall, it's just another food hunting spot for tourists?
4
Yes, its a touristy and yes some elements are more expensive however if you want a quick look at Hawker style food, all sorts of local SE Asian cuisane, in a relatively family friendly enviroment then go Newton. Just as long as you dont take it all too seriously is a nice place to go. Restaurant owners will always annoy you however this is Asia and it happens, English is no problems.We go quite often when we feel like jsut getting out for a quick eat.We normally take a bottle of wine with us to eat as well and buy a beer to start then crack open some wine and they generally are OK with it
4
A fun dining experience is to be had here. The hassle from restaurant proprietors is a bit overwhelming, so best to research and know which one you're going to.Singapore chilli crab was magnificent! Also had lobster. Check total price before agreeing to buy seafood. $6 per 100g sounds cheap but when you get brought over a kg lobster which you weren't expecting, it can get a bit pricier than anticipated.But overall such a fun experience. And did I mention the Singapore chilli crab ?
3
If you are just visiting for a short time, and you want one place that has all the signature Singapore dishes, this is it. You do get hassled by Spruikers pushing their stalls, best to ignire them.
4
Some really good Asian food here. Chilli crab was delicious. Not cheap but reasonably priced for and cold beer. Worth a visit.
5
among all hawker centers in Singapore, this is the most posh place. Food are great but be prepared cos its a little more pricey compared to the others.
1
Selling similar food at almost 3/4 of all stalls. Ripped off and average quality food even local don't patronise!
1
Im in a F & B business. The food that Newton Hawker offer are too much expensive and food are just so-so. I can find better food all around Singapore at a cheaper rate.
5
The food was very fresh and reasonably priced and extremely tasty and the beer was very cheap. I would certainly eat here again
3
Nothing special about this so say Singapore's once tourist attraction nite makan place. look like just another hawker center in town center......
4
We were recommended to go there, we had great food but wished we had of been stronger to stop Restaurant owners approaching you (although there are signs that say they cannot). It all looks good but you have to enjoy the hawker style eating outdoors to feel comfortable. It would be even better if you could speak their language! I wished we had eaten at the Crab place but maybe next time. Taxi to get home to Hotel was a bit of a wait.
2
The closest hawker centre to the tourist belt but expensive and the food is not as good as elsewhere. If you really want to try better food, Go to Lau Pa Sat. A cab ride is cheap compared to other big cities. Of if you're really adventurous, then a true blue hawker centre like Tiong Bahru market is a good bet
4
This is a Singapore must do. But there are a few rules:1. NEVER listen to the touts as you come in, just smile and nod, if they touch you just say "molest!!", they will back off,2. Get a table, leave someone there and go around alook for food,3. the drink sellers will come to your table - buy from them but check the price first - they all speak english, if they dont, then order from someone who does,4. NEVER buy from food touts - they will cheat your blind on price and demand S$ 45 per prawn or something ridiculous - these guys prey on stupid tourists,5. NEVER order unless you have an agreed or signboarded price,6. If you have any hassles, then get the stall number or the touts number. If they become agressive, call 999 and the police will come. I have called 999 many times and the cops here are excellent at sorting this thing out. Just DO NOT BECOME AGGRESSIVE OR SWEAR/OATH.My personal favourite is Ah Hengs carrot cake - it is a good mate and he knows all the people there. Just remember that it is a game for the touts etc. just smile and ignore them. But be careful of some of the local partons especially late at light. They can be very nasty.Selamat makan...
3
Plenty of local food to choose and try. Famous for grilled seafood , some even halal.
4
Great place to experience local cusine is in the hawker centre. Very wide variety of good food to pick from. Just ensure that you ask for the prices of the seafood before ordering, in case you're over-charged.
2
Locals would generally eat somewhere else. Rowdy drinking crowds late at night. Watch out for over-priced seafood stalls.
5
The food is great. True Singapore / Asian style hawker food. Although there are many hawker style food places in Singapore. Newton takes the Crown...
5
massive choice of food, we ate here twice and would highly recommend.

Most people will say that Newton Hawker Centre is a tourist’s trap. But I highly beg to differ. Unless you’re looking to have shark’s fins soup and abalone, almost every other thing that you can find there is of a fixed price. Just check before you order and you should be fine. I’d actually think of this place as a place offering one of the better quality seafood in town, because with so much competition, you’d have to stand out in order to survive!One thing to note, the minute you enter the hawker centre, you’ll be bombarded by tones of people holding menus from all the various stalls, touting business from their prospective customers – you. They will try to be nice and offer to find you seats, but most of the time it will be somewhere near their stalls so that you’d buy from them after being seated. Just be firm, the hawker centre IS A FREE SEATING FOOD PLACE like all other food centers around Singapore. You’re free to sit where you want to sit, and eat from whichever stalls you’d want to order from. Don’t feel pressured; just tell the people nicely that you do not need their help.If you’re unsure (because all menus look the same, and every other stalls sell the same barbeque seafood lookalikes), look out for this A1 logo at the A1 Seafood near the carpark entrance. I’m a regular at this stall, and I can guarantee you that the lady boss is one of the most honest stall owners that I’ve seen around. Just look out for this lady with big brown hair and a huge smile. Everything on the menu is priced at standard fixed prices, so fret not (maybe except Crabs that’s by-the-kilogram and prawns are slightly pricier – only because these types of seafood are naturally expensive to begin with). The quality of the food is also consistent and tasty. I especially recommend the Seafood Fried Rice, the Sambal Stingray (Stingray with Chilli), Sambal Kangkong, Sambal Sotong (Squid), and the Chilli Clams. Also, do order their Garlic King Prawns if you have a bigger budget for dinner. If you’re not a huge fan of spiciness, you can always ask the lady boss to recommend you some of the stall’s specialties and she’ll find what’s best for you.If I cannot convince you any further, let my images do its job. But whatever the case, A1 is probably one of the more patronized stalls there (she’s been in this business since before Newton hawker was being renovated, and she has a lot of regulars who patronize her stall all the time.) Although the stall is not registered as a stall providing Halal food, many Muslims still patronize the stall as she uses vegetable oil instead of lard (it’s also a much healthier choice).Other highly recommended stalls are (taking reference from A1 Seafood):- Oyster Omelet (Orh Lua) that’s at the 6 o’clock direction if you’re facing A1, stall 73 – I usually order the $5 “Orh Lua”.- WHITE fried carrot cake from Heng Carrot cake, along the stretch that A1 Seafood is on.- Satay and Popiah that’s at the stretch behind A1 seafood, facing the Carpark (both are at the same stall, and it’s the ONLY stall that sells both Satay and Popiah together)IF you cannot find any of the stalls and want to know which stall is best, just feel free to ask the stall owners at A1. They know which are the best stalls there.Preference for food differs from person to person, but I have frequent gatherings with various groups of friends at Newton Hawker Centre and most of them like the things that I order most of the time, so I have strong confidence that my recommendations are at least of an “above average” standard
2
I don't know if it's the management who accept the tenders from food stalls or coincidence, it appears the food and drink selection keep repeating themselves after every 5-6 stalls. There are several stalls offering similar dishes (eg, grilled seafood, fried kway teow/ noodles and even packed drinks). I stopped coming here ever sine my last visit due to the lack of food choices
3
Newton Hawker Centre is a must place for any type of visitor from anywhere in the world when visiting Singapore. A good range of local foods to choose from to truly enjoy what Singapore is all about when it comes to real tasty food. For sea food lovers, be weary when you order the sea creatures for your meal as the hawkers running such stalls will rip you apart when it comes to paying for such a meal. Still, this is the place to enjoy a great meal and lots of beer. Fantastic surroundings with lots of people from different walks of life every other night, makes this a great place to unwind. Go for it
4
My husband and I went to Newton Hawker Centre last Sunday for lunch, and were recommended by this Chinese stall to try their Rojak. Do not be mistaken, this is not the Indian one, but the Chinese style. The Chinese one is quite unique, with pineapple, pear, and you tiao. The portion is quite big too. :
4
We found out it is a night center so there was a few hawkers open for a late lunch. The Indian food was very tasting. Visited with the guys working the stand and a random old guy that saw we were tourists. Fun experience and some good food. I was warned later to only purchase food that the price is clearly marked. Some Hawkers were price gouging people.
4
Only a few stalls are open in the morning, but enough variety.
2
Iconic hawker centre, but most certainly a tourist place. A few good stalls but dominated by seafood BBQ stalls that charges exhorbitant prices! Go there for the atmosphere, and stick to non-expensive food like satays, oyster omelettes, fried hokkien noodles etc.
2
Overpriced, overrated hawker food. You are better off visiting Lau Pa Sat
2
Need I say more? Touting, pressure to buy from certain stores, over-priced food.
5
Haven't been to Newton Circus for roughly 10 years and although they have done it up, all for the good, it was still sensational. The food and service were exceptional, thorougly enjoyable and we will always come back to NC.....
3
Reasonable food, but overpriced relative to other hawker centres in SG
2
Over priced hawker fare. You can get much better hawker food at other places. Newton Hawker Centre is meant for tourist.
1
You have people asking you to eat at their stand while walking around looking at menus, very annoying when you try have a nice diner without being pushing around. That's unfortunate this centre used to be a good one. People told me that the high rents that stand owners pay make them "agressive" toward getting customers... The food quality has also decreased the last 3 years. Avoid this tourist trap
4
The very aggressive hawkers turned me off at first. But we learned that if you just wave them away (and don't make eye contact (difficult for a friendly country girl)) - they do leave you alone and let you make your choices. You sit at a table near the middle (remember your table number or leave someone there to wave at the hawker so they'll know where to deliver the food). I prefer to order AT each stand - to ensure I know the correct price. We went back a second night - because it was so convenient to where we were staying - and the food was really good, and we had no difficulty at all. The Black Carrot Cake is delicious (warning to the novice: no carrots; not cake). And I love the pointy chicken wings: I'm going to make them that way at home from now on. It was great watching the plates that the locals had delivered. Next time maybe we'll be more courageous
1
The food there is good, however, prices over there are way above the usual prices. Try other local hawker centres such as "Chomp Chomp" at Serangoon Gardens, Adam Road Food Centre or Tiong Bahru Food Centre. The food at these places are comparable to Newton Hawker Centre, in fact, some might say better, and the best thing is, its prices are cheaper and more..authentic.
1
The place only interested in tourist. Avoid those hawkers selling BBQ seafood.
2
The price too expensive, bit over price, I know better hawker center and better food... this is too touristy... and the price is too expensive.
4
conveniently located near newton mrt . 3 mins to orchard road.
U can enjoy all local food here. Is a must come place for tourists.
Enjoy our satay, bbq sting ray , fried kway teow, Hokkien prawn noodles etc etc :))
3
Newton Hawker Centre may be worth visiting as a tourist, if you want to see what hawker centres are like, but as someone living in the city, I feel it is over-rated and very expensive. I avoid visiting it.
4
I like the open air atmosphere for group meeting with my friends for food and drink.
4
Found a stall on the outside as inside it was too noisy. Got on well with the stall holder who returned the favour every time we visited. Food was good and relatively reasonably priced. Beer price was the same as it was 10 years ago.
1
Lots of touts with overpriced items. Good for tourists though but not for the natives since quality of food is just passable. Nothing great.
2
Touristy and expensive. Stalls basically sells the same things.
3
After the cab dropped us off at the center we were a bit overwhelmed by the activity. Here are some tips that I wish I had known 1. Be ready to be approached by all vendors particularly the high margin seafood vendors2. Take your time, walk around and find a seat near a stall that appeals to you. They will bring the food to your dedicated table.3. keep in mind that the seating area is a public space, and not owned by the seafood guys who will thrust a menu in your face. If you want satays, sugar cane juice and beers only, then no problem; no obligation to order from them.4. If you want the seafood which is indeed fresh, be sure to inspect it checking for size of claws and have it weighted. I was missing a gigantic claw, they just shrugged and walked away.5 . Aside from the missing claw, we had lots of fun and enjoyed this experience.Next time I will try Maxwell hawker center for greater authenticity and less wheeling dealing

Tiger Beer 600ml @ Sing$7, Erdinger 500ml @ $7.80...Roti Prata @ $2.80 per piece, Prawn noodle @ Sing$5-10 per bowl, bah kut teh (ditto) have all gone up in prices...

Danish beer 300ml in HKG @ Sing40cents (you read that correctly, bro
5
A great experience and amazing food - too much choice. Catch the 196 bus to Newton Circle/Circus and have a feast - cold beer, cheap food, great choice and a lot of fun. A touch of "old Singapore", hawker-style.
5
This was the best food and atmosphere we experienced for food in Singapore. The quality and price of the street food with the comfort of a restaurant
1
Newton Hawker Centre was built up to be a place to go ans sample great food and great prices; I found neither! It was dirty, smelly and not great value. Visit at your own peril
2
it's quiet expensive. I'm still student. I don't have enough money. For me, I just can go sometimes.
1
Newton Hawker Centre serves mediocre local food at cut-throat prices sold by aggressive stall holders. It is one place I would avoid.
1
You will not find any locals eating there and it is mostly tourists who have no idea about the local prices. Do not get conned. Ask for prices and then order!
5
There are lots of negative reviews on TA regarding this place with most seemingly written by Singaporeans. I guess it's the same as most cities - the locals have their favourites that may be off the beaten track and tend to avoid touristy places - we do the same at home in Perth.That said, we ate at Newton twice in a week and both times went to shop #46. Mr Liang looked after us both times.On both occasions we had 1kg black pepper crab, 1kg chilli crab, buns, fried rice (1 x chicken + 1 x seafood) plus a small serving of half-cooked cockles. The price on both occasions was a bit over SGD$80 for the food plus another SGD$18 for drinks. Maybe that is a lot for Singaporeans but for us, from Australia, we thought it good value for the excellent products we received.We can offer no recommendations for anywhere other than shop #46 (and the drinks shop next door, #45??) but we have no hesitation in recommending shop #46. Ask for Mr. Liang and say that we sent you
5
If you like to try lots of dishes and south east asian cuisines, then Newton is the place to go. It's very clean with really tasty food but it's not air-conditioned. If you want authenticity at a really reasonably price, then Newton will tick all the boxes. Just bring a big appetite :-
4
I love the way you can walk around all the stalls, browse the menus and then order little tidbits from each vendor which comes delivered to your open air table. On a lovely breezy evening, you can sip a fruit cocktail or cold beer and snack on giant grilled prawns, fantastic noodles, char grilled fish aNd loads of satays. Value, quality and great old world atmosphere..real Singapore
2
We are locals so we were careful not to be fleeced. But the American guy sitting at the next table was not so lucky. We overheard him questioning the stall helper about his $72 bill for five prawns. Granted, these were big prawns, but $72??? The food is nothing to shout about either. Go only when you're in the vicinity and hungry. Definitely not worth going out of your way to visit this. Lots of better, cheaper and more authentic hawker food in many other places in Singapore.

The food there is really good and I love it. Their sauce is very full of flavour and it really makes the food look more appetising as well. I like the dessert best!
1
Too noisy, too expensive/overpriced food. Not recommended.
5
Great all-round hawker food experience. Food is good and reasonably priced (though make sure you check prices in advance with the vendors!)
Great dish to try is the chilli stingray available at most of the seafood vendors.
4
A little more expensive than other hawker centres, but well worth it for the atmosphere. Seafood dishes can be very expensive.
3
There are good hawker stands here, but not all are up to the same standard. Watch where the locals are lining up for a hint on which spots are the best.

Where is the Newton Circus Hawker Center of yore? Where a bowl of the best Indian Mee Goreng was $1.80? A plate of over fried anything starts at SGD$ 22 for a small plate, and by local standards, that's more than extortion. It's so sad that that whole area has been gutted out and re-fitted - the old one epitomised what Singapore food fare had to offer and in its own unique setting. Sadly, that's all gone now and I hear the beautiful back and whites are also headed for the demolition derby. I bid a tearful adieu to an area that all Singaporeans have great memories of
3
As a local, this is a great place to come for seafood and a beer. It has a busy and noisy ambience, making it great for people spotting. However, the stall owners and touts can very pushy and bothersome, despite attempts to prevent such actions. The 1/2 dozen entrances/exits are also permanently 'manned' by smokers meaning you can't get in or out without a lung full of second hand smoke

best hawker centre in Singapore. Murtabak from the north indian stall and a lot fo good seafood stalls are highlights. special mention also for bangkok express too. by far and away the best stall is the Indian Palace though. this stall is manned by a charming family who seem to have limitless smiles and excellent service. Their curry is simply brilliant and easily on a par if not better with michelin starred curry houses I have visited in London. this guy really deserves all the praise he gets. We're repeat customers and currently working our way down the menu. inexpensive and consistently delicious, it's the best place i've eaten at in Singapore. top notch

Huge selection of food, you will find what you want. I want to echo and earlier reviewer who stated to look where the locals are lining up to find the best food.  Can get a good plate of food for around $3 - $4, not counting your drink(s), which generally will have to be purchased at a separate shop within the center. Also purchased a fresh fruit smoothie at a shop for around $2.Note to US travelers: They don't want US currency or credit card; walk across the street and pull out $20 Singapore from the ATM and you should be good. Those staying for a period of time in Singapore might find this advice silly, but those on layovers sometimes overlook it
1
Touting, price discrimination and rude service..... Is this place for real? I mean... if you just want a quick meal and get out, no problem there. BUT, if you want to enjoy an evening having some of our beloved local food, this is the wrong place to head to. Avoid this place if you are a tourist and want to have some decent seafood at a fair price. They are just 'sharpening their knives' and waiting to rip you off the moment you get there!!! And if you are a local.... what are you doing there? At least thats what i am thinking after my last outing there
2
The food is so so and expensive. The stallholders tend to serve the tourists better than the locals.
5
So many great foods all crammed into one exciting area only 1 MRT stop from Orchard Road! Chilli Crab, Fried Carrot Cake and Chicken Wings are just some of the great food you will find in this multi cultural arena.
4
Can be fun even if some of the soul in the food has departed after the last renovation a few years back. Still fun eating under the stars... and ignore the touts if you can.
4
Newton Circus is a great hawker's center. The perfect place to venture forth into the world of Hawker food...lot's of choices, clean, accessible by the train very easily. Here is a link to my blog on our meal there - http://theadventuresofmisspiggy.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/hawker-centers-singapore.html
3
Rather crowded n it's definitely a spot for tourists.As locals,there r other options.
3
theres no crowd...dont know what happen.
i guess theres no variety. and each stall owner cant really cook hahahahhahahahhahahahha
1
over-rated and full of tourist! SG go much better hawker centre than this one
1
Place dirty. Food overpriced. BBQ food stall pulling customers and eyeing everyone that walks in esp. tourists. Does not create a good feeling. You just want to finish quickly and get out.
5
I always go there for the sugar cane juice! A lot of things are closed at lunch time but at night it is bustling.
2
I went to this hawker centre a few times. All the previous visits were fine. However, when I went with my mom to a particular Malay stall in December 2011, my mom complained that we waited the food for over 10 to 15 minutes, but the lady boss just told my mom to be patient. After that remark, my mom and I never go back to that stall again
1
The place is run by a mafia of aggressive hawkers who charge $500 per chilli crab.
2
Prices and services are tourist orientated. Most locals avoid here since you can get the same at other hawkers at half the price.
Not recommended unless you stay across the street and do not have time to explore other options.
2
This place is known for being bad service, overrated, dishonest. I've eaten there once when I was young, but have heard lotsa horror stories from friends, relatives, and the media. Go to other places... u can find better food at better prices!
2
This place is definitely over-rated. Food quality is not fantastic and price is definitely a no-no!
4
Always good food during the entire day. Fun thing of these places is, that if they do not have good food, they go out of business in several weeks, they have to keep up with the quality of competition which is huge at newton hawker center. It's a clean hawker center as well, like this on
5
Singapore's hawker centres are one of the city's joys; great food at very cheap prices. Newton is well-established, with plenty of choice: chilli Crab, black pepper crab (even better than chilli crab!) and Tiger prawns. The place may look chaotic but it's not: grab a table (and remember its number), then cruise past the various stalls and choose your dinner; it will be delivered to your table swiftly. A really great way to enjoy the local food, with plenty of atmosphere
3
Years ago I would give only 1 star to this Food Centre. It does not get by with good food. Prices are not exactly cheap too. But it is a one-stop to taste the local delicacies without having to travel to too many places. Having itself near Orchard Road, I suppose the little price increment is a premium the tourists have to pay. For me, I'd only go in the middle of the night if I am in the vicinity and too lazy to think of where to get a bite
4
While some comments state this isn’t the best hawker centre in Singapore, we still had a thoroughly enjoyable mealThe downside to the huge choice of stands is that you cannot pass, pause or even look at them without being targeted by their owner. Each outlet is obviously keen to get you to eat at their own establishment. A polite ‘just looking’ does the trick, but only until you venture three steps to the next stall!Eventually we gave up and selected stall No 78, after the owner Margaret went to great pains to explain the menu and process.All the stalls seem to push fish, probably due to it being more expensive. We were given laminated menus with pictures of the food and prices clearly displayed. Most of the dishes came in four sizes, in general small, medium, large and extra large,We ordered a medium fried rice (plenty of prawns in it), a small lemon chicken and a small fried dumpling plate. The latter contained ten decent sized prawn filled dumplings. The three dishes provided more than enough food for two to share.Drinks are ordered separately from vendors that only deal in drinks. You do not need to leave your seat to order – the vendor will find you. All food and drink is paid for at the end of the meal. Cost for the three dishes and a large tiger beer (approx 650ml) was SGD36. Well worth the trouble of a visi
3
Newton Hawker center is centrally located with many stalls. Many of the food sold are not that bad but not excellent either. Because tourist do not know of other places to eat - they tend to go to Newton to eat - and pay very high price for the food. In Singapore there are a lot of places to eat - including those food courts in shopping malls and coffee shops. Tourist - I urge you to ask any people in the streets or at your hotel where ELSE you can go to have some local food... and you should be able to find one within 1 to 2 km...
2
Pushy stall owners, only ok food, and ridiculous prices! Not a place I'd be recommending. Waited more than 25 minutes for our food, then went back to the stall to realise they had lost the order. And when the food arrived, it wasn't anything to write home about
4
Delicious hawker food and a great atmosphere - well worth the trip
3
This is a hawker centre which tourist have become attracted to. Be aware that many of the items on the menu's are sold by their weight, which may not always be obvious. That said most of the food sold, (mainly seafood) is of good quality and flavour.Can be reached by MRT to Newton Circus just one stop from Orchard Road.
1
This is very close to home, but we actually try and suggest to friends not to go there. They are expensive, the Hawkers is not as good as the many others around town - this is an example where they have gained a good reputation through word of mouth or travel books and they don't deserve. If you do decide to go, make sure they don't rip you off on price
2
Since it was renovated, most of the shops aren't there anymore and it's hot and it seems like there are just those seafood shops. I don't go anymore and i used to love it. It's cleaner yes... but less messy totally. I feel the food is just not as good. Although the fish ball noodles and fish hat (yu tiao). So have not been back in almost a year
3
As a native, I wouldn’t say this is the best hawker center around. There are only a handful of good food stalls there but most are average. What makes this hawker center unattractive is the prices. Because it’s a “tourist” attraction, you get higher prices; basically it’s a tourist trap. Don’t be pressure by the touting hawkers. Find a seat and take your time to decide on what you feel like having
2
If you are a tourist looking for a 'real' hawker centre experience do not go here. The food prices are highly inflated, the touts will drive you crazy and there are other touts who want to sell you sunglasses, watches etc. For a real experience, go to Lau Pa Sat in the financial district, If you are going to lunch you need to get there by 11:45 as the tables fill very quickly. Leave someone at your table to 'mind' it or place packets of disposable tissues at everyone's seats or you may come back to find others sitting in your seats. If you see an 'empty' table with packets of tissues on it, this means that the table has been taken

This place is a tourist rip-off, there have been several incidents of people being charged hundreds of dollars for hawker food. Examples may be found in Tripadvisor reviews, as well as a search of past news stories. If you are cheated, you should file an official complaint with the Singapore Tourism Board, they have successfully taken one of the stalls at Newton to court before on behalf of a tourist who was cheated.If you want a good Hawker Centre experience try Chomp Chomp, Lau Pa Sat, Maxwell Road Food Centre, East Coast Park Food Centre, or just about any other hawker centre in Singapore for a more authentic experience and better food. Ask Singaporeans for recommendations, just about anyone will be willing to share their advice on this topic
3
It's quite touristy and the prices reflect it. It's more expensive than going to Lau Pa Sat or a smaller local place, but the food is good. Always cheaper than a proper restaurant, just prepare to get hassled by the stalls as you walk past. The best bet is to just walk around the whole place and look at each stall to see what you want to get - don't let the hawkers get too pushy - if you tell them no then they should leave you alone. Check prices before you order - especially things like crab which are done by weight. Confirm what size you'll be charged for

... Newton Hawker Centre is the place to visit, to walk around, have a look, chose, sit down under the open sky without any aircon & enjoy simple but tasty food.The food was okay, not of the quality as JUMBO seafood east cost, but okay. & the atmosphere is unique, especially when all the year you've to eat in 5* hotels, posh restaurants.Another bonus: it's open very late.We loved it
5
We went to this place twice a couple of weeks back. Saturday night is great fun with lots of people getting down for a feed. You can get cheap eats as well as tasty (but more expensive) seafood. Just for people watching alone its worth a visit.We walked around on the first night and were stopped by one lady who was probably one of the best saleswomen I've ever come across! She got her cook to whip up some awesome chilli crab and veggies.It wasn't super cheap but it was super tasty. The second time we went back we ended up going to her again and she looked after us really well, cooking up some thai style sea bass.I dont know her name or stall number but if you approach from newton MRT station you cross over the pedestrian bridge to get to newton hawker centre, when you enter via the bridge, turn right and walk up beside the stalls, after about 15-20 stalls you'll probably get stopped by this woman. She's great!Happy eating!
2
Newton has a good variety of local delights that comes with higher-than usual price tags. You wouldn't see much local Singaporeans at this hawker center.
5
We went there with local people, and, although they claim the area is touristic, I could find it quite singaporean.... Loved it! Lovely food and really cheap. Try the crabs....
3
Favour of tourist where you can try all sorts of local food, but over priced and know to charge tourist prices.
3
Not delicious as before. food are generally overpriced.
5
We went here twice because of the excellent indian food. Fast service. Try also the desserts. Hawker Centre easy to reach by metro from everywhere.
5
The only places to eat and enjoy true local cuisine are the hawker centres, my first choice every time
4
This place is now a bit of a tourist trap - but you can still get good, cheap food if you are careful. If you are going to order any seafood - make sure you know how much they propose to charge upfront. The fried kuay teow is always good value and delicious, as is the chilli stingray. Wash it down with some chilled tiger beer and you have a perfect late night meal
1
overpriced, too much touting and not much good food. it servers more like a tourist destination than a place for locals. i would definitely not recommend this to anyone. the only stall i wouldn't mind having is the XO ba chor mee, but i wouldn't take the effort to go there just to have that
4
Newton Hawker Center is probably the most well known Hawker Center in Singapore (at least by the tourists). There are an excellent variety of foods at Newton and the quality is very good. I however would recommend other places such as Glutton's Bay near the Esplanade, or Lau Pa Sat for the scenery and location. If you are near then by all means go but it does not warrent a special trip
3
I know this is one of “the” Hawker Centre’s in Singapore and, to be honest, I did use to really enjoy this place. It all depends on your expectations. It’s in a good location, and does serve pretty good local foods. A nice introduction to the Singapore Hawker experience.For tourists, it’s definitely one of the nicer looking centres in Singapore… leafy, open, green and secluded from the traffic. Plus the stone floor is attractive and, of course, very clean. But, the downside is that the choices are very limited. And, depending on your expectations, a little expensive.Most of the stalls specialize in seafood. I don’t particularly like seafood, which leaves with me one or two BBQ meat stalls. These are fine (and actually much cheaper than seafood), but you can get BBQ meats in almost every street corner in Singapore!So, like I said… it depends on your expectations. I still recommend this place to tourists, but don’t come here so much myself anymore.Tips: be forceful with the touts… if you really don’t want what they are offering (i.e. their table, their drinks, their food, their napkins etc…) just tell them. And please take a look at the signs giving advice on the pricing… those visual signs do a much better job of describing the correct “haggling process” than I could
4
I was there during lunch hours, and quite a few of the vendors were closed. I ordered a BBQ stingray and it was pretty good. It was about 12SGD. The place was clean and nice but hopefully a night experience would have been better.
2
With so many great places to eat in Singapore, Newton Hawker Centre should be avoided. Lots of pressure to buy overpriced items, particularly seafood. There are many other places in Singapore where you get better food, at better prices, in a more pleasant atmosphere.
1
Honestly save your self the disappointment. You will get far better service food and prices in Chinatown
3
This is a place for the tourists, the locals hardly patronise this area, as the food is more expensive than those served at the neighbourhood food centres. Furthermore, the food is not necessarily more delicious.
3
We went to Newton on recommendation of the taxi driver- it looked a fun place to go, as it was, very evocative of the amosphere of Singapore. There were many "trawlers" trying to lure you to their tables- we were seduced by giant barbecued garlic prawns and chilli crab- which were delicious and we enjoyed- until we recieved the bill! 144Sin$ for a meal for two with plastic plates and knives and forks. Left feeling somewhat taken for a ride. The Singaporeans have heard that this place is expensive, the system seems to be go round to the stalls and pay as you go, do not accept what is brought to you and then pay later
4
It's a little like walking through the post tourist attraction gauntlet but the food is quite good. The section we sat at would grab food from a few different vendors so it worked well. Worth the trip over. Just a short walk from the Newton Metro station.
1
This place is more for tourists and locals will avoid if they could. Foods are so-so and pricey. You have other better hawker centres elsewhere than this, where foods much tasty, better and cheaper.Hawkers here when they see locals walking in, they do not bother, knowing that they cannot ripped them off unlike tourists. So tourists be warned.If you wanted to try local foods, there are many hawker centres around the island, that sell the same things what Newton centre offered. You do not need to come here to try.Chances of tourists getting ripped off here is high, which has been proven on newspaper
4
Located just off Orchard Road, Newton Hawker Centre is an easy stop for tourists wanting to experience eating outdoors, hawker centre style. The likes of sambal sting-ray, satay, sugarcane juice, mee goreng etc are available albeit at somewhat higher prices. As you approach the hawker centre, many of the stall owners will approach you to ask you to order food from them. You are not obliged to sit down directly. Take your time and have a look around. Look at the dishes on the tables of those who are already eating at the stalls. That should give you an idea of what's good or not and the portion sizes

Having grown up in Malaysia and being a keen cook, I like to think that my palate is quite educated in terms of Malaysian/Singaporean cuisine. We went to Newton Hawker Centre on the recommendation of a hotel staff member. From the start, you feel pressured by the touting. As you arrive, scouts from the various seafood stalls will spot you as tourists and notice your helplessness as you look around for an empty table. Having found you one, they push their menu onto you and, being a pushover, I feel obliged to order something from them. We had an oyster omelette (good), satay (tiny skewers, chewy beef), BBQ skate (tasty but greasy), fried rice and koay teow (both tasteless and rather devoid of protein or vegetable matter). I do concede that we might not have sampled food from the best stalls and that I may be making sweeping generalisations, however, even the food we had from the Kopitiam food court in Vivo City was much better in both taste and variety, and also cheaper. The other thing that detracts is that you have to use flimsy plastic cutlery that gets caught by the strong gusts from the strong oscillating fans, often showering you in food. Also, we were told that there wouldn't be a problem getting back to the hotel as there is a taxi stand there, but this is not the case. Most of the cabs that were dropping off passengers seemed to be enroute to some pre-booked destination. It took us 45 minutes to finally hail down some cabs that hadn't been pre-booked. All in all, an over-rated and disappointing experience. The night after that, we went to Chinatown and had a fantastic meal, both in taste and value. Note that this is in the food court (level 2 of the market building) and not in Food St, which is pretty but looks even more of a tourist trap than Newton. In the Chinatown food court, there are extensive numbers of stalls selling all kinds of foods. Make sure you go early as many were already shut by 8pm
3
Yep they haven't changed. Coming back to this place after years. Last time I was here, there was an older chinese woman throwing up on the table. In spite of the 'no touting' signs the place crawls with them. The quality of the food is average at best. It is arguably possible to have a good dinner there while beating off the touts and trying to make sure you're not getting ripped off. But why bother? There are better places in Singapore and I for one will not be coming back

Although some locals do not recommend this hawker centre because it's touristy or a little bit more pricey than other hawker centres, I really like Newton Hawker Centre!Newtown Hawker Centre has a great variety of delicious local foods at cheap prices and it opens until very late. Because I always stay around Newton/Novena area whilst in Singapore, this place is handy for me. Especially sometimes I only stopover in Singapore for 1-2 days only and I always come by here and then I'd check out Mustafa 24 hour shopping centre afterwards since it's quite close.Do not worry about the vendors wanting you to buy foods at their stalls, and take your time looking around at places you fancy. Also, do not be fooled by the stall's owners. Once, my partner was tricked into buying this jumbo prawns (they're really huge because they're bigger that your computer mouse!) and they're really expensive and not worth it. Also, remember to look for A-grade stalls (they will have big A. B, C rated) for the cleanest stalls
4
This place is usually highly recommended on books and guides, however, as a local, I'd strongly advise tourists from having seafood at the stalls in this hawker centre. Better seafood at much better value can be found at other hawker centers around Singapore. However, newton hawker centre indeed serves well as a late night, supper place full of local cuisine that is of decent quality. Try the duck noodles, Cheng tng stalls over at the row of stalls facing the car park
4
I'm somekind of hard to pleased, but I find this restaurant a really good one. Its food was good. My family liked it very much. Its staff were friendly and well-trained also. They're politeness. There is one thing I adjust is that, the restaurant should improve its facilities to create a warmer atmosphere, so that guests could enjoy the food in better backdrop
5
This is the first time I have returned to Newton since it's renovation a few years back. I have to say I like it still. The food choices are great and I really enjoyed the cha kue teow, bbq chicken wings, oyster omelet, po piah, kang kong belachan and roast duck...and tiger prawns grilled with garlic.The only thing I didn't really care for is that the vendors kept chasing me as I look like an angmoh (even though i grew up in KL and Sing) and am Eurasian. They left my relatives alone as they looked more local I suppose. No big deal though
4
The prices at Newton are several times higher than at neighborhood hawker centers. Nevertheless our family enjoys coming here, the kids like it. Usually a boisterous, friendly environment. Several can't-lose dishes such as pepper beef and chicken rice that the kids vacuum up. We always get lime juice to drink from one of the many drink vendors. The kids also like to practice with chop sticks. Although Newton is priced for tourists, the majority of the customers seem to be locals
5
This serves consistently tasty and very fresh seafood. Stingray, pepper crab and kang kong (green veg) are our must haves every time we come. Great value for money. Pick your own crab to get the size you want. You must try the laksa sold by the first hawker on the right as you go in the main entrance. The place is filled with locals every night. Plus a few expats like us
4
I had heard this was a bit of a tourist trap, but was favourably impressed. If the tourists like it, it's for good reason, as the food is really, really good and really, really cheap. We were the only westerners the afternoon we went though. The centre is nice to look at, a large wooden structure surrounded by greenery. It's arranged in a circular pattern of food stalls, very clean, with outdoor seating areas under overhead ceiling fans. The food is spicy and delicious. Do go and try it
5
I have been to Singapore about 5 times and always make a point of going here and I also recommend it to friends/collegues that are visiting.I have a soft spot for this place as I went to uni in Singapore for 6 months about 14 years ago. The old Newton Circus hawker centre was bonkers. Lively atmosphere and less than impressive toilet facilities but the food was cheap and plentiful and the beer was also cheap and icy cold. All you could ask for as a student. Now I am all grown up, I made a poin of going to the new Newton hawker centre as I had read the old centre has been knocked down and moved accross the road. It is all nice and a lot cleaner, no smoking and its covered so it doesnt matter if it is raining. The toilets are a million percent better. But the food and the beer are exactly the same. Great. Dont be put off my anyone trying to make you sit at their stall. Just walk around till you see something you like and order it.We always go around stall 46 as we made friends with a guy calle Po who will do anything for you. He sits you down and you dont have to worry about anything. You order everything from him and he goes to the different stalls to arrange everything for you. You just pay the different people when they come. Satays are 0.50 singapore cents each which is 25p in UK money or 2.50HKD. Po's stall does the best stingray with a spicy and tasty sauce. The stall next to his does cheap and ice cold bottles of tige beer. Its simply great and ideal for couples, large groups of friends or families. I wish there were places like this in Hong Kong. This place makes me want to live in Singapore. Open from 4pm til 4am. Easy to get to on the MRT
4
We walked there from where we staying. We stayed around orchard road. It was about 15-20 mins walk. We had the chilli crab and black pepper crab! Crabs are about SG$3.50 per 100g at this place. There are about 50 stalls open at that time making it very hard to choose which stall you want your food from. The service was excellent from Pirate Seafood Stall! The guy Jason served us..he was excellent! I also tried the sambal pari/stingray.. it was nice! At 12am midnight, the place is still rocking..lots of crowds..awesome night out
4
I just came back from Singapore again on a work trip, as usual the local colleagues brought me to Newton Food Centre on my final night there. I dreaded it a little because in previous visits, I always get swarmed by hawkers who are all selling the same dishes, BBQ Seafood, and then some.This time, things have changed. Shops between No. 56-66 give you a less stressful dining experience there. The drinks store owner told me the current talking point is this store No. 64 that sells nasi lemak, or coconut milk rice, a local favourite for breakfast lunch dinner and supper. Turns out, the owner is a fine young lad who's a Masters' holder, used to be a GM of some MNC and drived a Merc SLK Convertible. Gave it all up to follow his hobby and passion.I do not know about you, but to give up an SLK Convertible, damn this guy is insane. Well, the nasi lemak i had was very pleasant. It was rather light, and had many interesting dishes to go with the rice, curry chicken, curry pork, and some peranakan dishes as well. It was a fulfilling meal together with the other favourites like fried prawn noodles and carrot cake. I have to say, if you do visit singapore and go to newton, do visit the row of shops i mentioned, No. 56-66. Very enjoyable, and you get a fine young lad serving you nasi lemak, THAT was the highlight of my recent trip, to Singapore, and to Newton Food Centr
