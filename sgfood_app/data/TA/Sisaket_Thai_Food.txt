This is original Thai food I recommend. Taste is the same in Thailand. The recommended dish is Tom yum fried rice. Warning !! It's spicy u should tell if u don't want less spicy.

I was in this stand/ restaurant situated in the Maxwell Food Centre three days ago and was not impressed. I had the Tom Yam Soup. But there were so many people waiting for food and praising it that i decided to give it another try before doing a (first) review. And indeed the chicken with cashew nuts is very good. The service is pure Thai, with a smile in the face. Affordable
