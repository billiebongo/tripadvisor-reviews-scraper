Service was below average & especially considering that there was only one other table during that time. Food was alright. We enjoyed the Peking duck.
We were expecting much better food & service, looks like standard has deteriorated over the years.

Excellent dim sum in a nice classy setup. The decor looks tired but it seems like the hotel will be renovated in 2017.

Enjoyed it. Good tasting variety. Pork buns were my favourite. Nice and juicy filling. Desserts surprisingly good too. The decorations is a bit kitsch but nice historic. A fun way to experience Raffles at lunch.

Nice ambience, good food, reasonable price and good service.
Had some of the signature dishes and were up to expectation.

Outstanding restaurant serving exemplary Asian cuisine. The food served at Royal China will ensure you repeat your visit to experience the culinary delights they have to offer. From the Peking Duck to the Dimsums and their Egg Tarts each dish is a treat for the tastebuds.Booking before is highly recommended as the restaurant is rightly in great demand

I'd walked the longest way to get here, part was lost and part was its far. I went here in the afternoon and it was crowded full of table and they set for me a table in the corner. The servant was really good, but the food was coming out really slow. I and my boyfriend ate about 6-7 dishes and it took about 47-51$ i believe. I don't remember the name of the dishes so I post with the photos for you to easy look up. You must go here to try a fancy meal, because the quatity goes along with the money I recommend having a good-looking clothes, don't wear flip flop and you will be fin

The decor and color scheme of restaurant were very pleasing.We dined on the 2nd night of Chinese New year and surprisingly the number of diners was sparse. They must have had only a skeleton staff because service was slow and inattentive.The menu was pretty limited in that we did not have any choice in the soup and vegetables.The dishes took a pretty long time to arrive despite the small number of diners. They even forgot the 7th item (roast chicken) that we ordered which we finally cancelled. However, the chef redeemed himself in preparing a very delicious steamed fish (soon hock) and beef with mushrooms in hot pot

Nice dim sum in a cozy restaurant. They served good dim sum but the century egg porridge is disappointed as it was too dry. Overall this place is good for business and family gathering as it is not noisy compared to other restaurant. Staff service is excellent
5
We had a delicious dim sum meal here. Service was excellent and the food was really good. One of the best dim sum meals I have had. Everything was fresh and tasty. The one thing I would mention is that the air conditioning was a little too cold

If you like dim sum, dont go here. If you like nice looking decors and couldnt care less about the dining experience, then maybe royal china is your place. To sum up, the dim sum was of abysmal quality, the service was slow and inattentive, and it was overpriced. To put things into perspective, the dim sum you would get at a chain like canton paradise is of superior quality, bigger portions and cheaper price. All in all, a hugely disappointing dining experience at above average price
5
Wonderful Dim Sum at a worthy price. It's not too expensive and their Shao Rou (Roasted Pork) is a must order dish. Char Siew Buns are very good as well.
5
This is by far one of my favourites. Visit them a couple of time so far food never disappoint me
Not too pricey and nice restaurant with good service . Centrally located

Everything is right in this restaurant-- the food, the service, the elegant interiors, its location. Secure your reservation quick:)

for set menu, they will give you very good combination of menu, seafood, very yummy and must try roasted duck, fish, pork and nice dessert. Excellent service, not noisy and comfortable place.

We were there for Sunday brunch, first seating at 11.Very tasty!Food service is efficient, and in typical Chinese style arrives when a dish is ready in the kitchen. Dim sum portions are three per serving, which makes it a bit awkward for the non-three family. There is an idea to tailor portions to the party...The décor clearly has seen better days, although I did appreciate the departure from the typical red/Gold color scheme of Chinese restaurants. When you first walk in, there is an oversize silk relief on the wall of the rather small entryway, which is torn in multiple places, kind of setting the tone for the tired light blue carpets inside. Oh, make sure you don't sit below the aircon vents. They have not been cleaned in a long time and are spewing dust on your meal the entire time

The set up at the Raffles is quite interesting. They have a number of their own restaurants which are famous in their own right, but they also lease out space to other businesses. I guess business-wise it may make sense. They spread out the risk to others who then have to make money to survive.The restaurant can be found on the third floor. If you follow the signs you can’t go too far wrong:). The signs will take you towards the escalators. I certainly advise this over the stairs, especially in this tropical heat. If appropriate to the restaurant, I do put on a pair of trousers and the Raffles certainly calls for it, even if not everyone believes so.The decor is very tasteful. The blue make the whole venue look very classy. Not garish at all, almost a powdered blue look.Of course there are quite a number of tables, but given the setting it is usually quite quiet and an ideal venue for a special occasion. I was just taking some people who were visiting town and wanted to try some dim sum and had never been to the Raffles Hotel, so I managed to kill two birds with one stone.Like many restaurants they have a specials menu – in this case they call it “Chef’s Special Recommendation”. I’m not sure how often this changes, but I’m pretty sure the duck and the crisy pork belly remain on there at all times

Arrived on a Sunday lunchtime with no booking but fortunately was able to get a table within 10 minutes. Unfortunately it is so busy at this time that it is difficult to get service. Some of the dim sum favs had already run out. We had to ask for water 3 times before it appeared. The food was slow to be served, but I would say that food is really nice. It took ages to get the bill and at the end to get the card back - just getting the card back took around 10 minutes. When trying to make a comment about the poor service at the front desk the lady offered no sort of apology

Went to had dimsum for lunch at Royal China a few days ago and it was fantastic. Food was delicate and perfectly cooked. I must say they've maintained a good standard, since they are as good as they were a few years ago. Used to come twice a month for the custard bun when I studied in Singapore, and they still taste as fantastic as they used to be. Better make reservations if you're coming for lunch
5
This could be one of the biggest restaurant in Raffles and is an excellent place for a quite eating out with an extremely classy food. There are a few very special unique dishes to choose , and not to miss the Duck any time. Always I make a point to visit them whenever in Singapore. Excellent dining experience.

Firstly, if you want a glass of white wine that's not Chardonnay, tough, as that's all they have on offer.We ordered a half of aromatic duck for two and it was Ok.The broccoli we ordered also arrived followed by our steak dish. By the time we had eaten the duck the beef and brocalli were cold. Five minutes later the chicken dish arrived and that was cold too when the egg fried rice arrived. A total inedible disaster, they packed up the food in plastic cartons for us to take away and offered a 10% discount, but at 150 dollars this is awful food and service, not up to Raffles Standards

This restaurant was a complete disaster, I know quite well chinese cuisine but this was by far the worst place I ever eat.
Pekin duck disgusting, and duck interior too old
I think Is a tourist trap
Never ever in.my life

My seventh time in this restaurant. The dimsum offerings are divine (the only better place, in my opinion is the weekly dimsum menu at Li Bai at the Sheraton). Friendly attentive service. Elegant interiors of baby clue and soft gold. I keep coming back!

My friends and I have had better tasting dim sums elsewhere. Surprisingly the cost was v reasonable and cheaper than when we when wah lol, taste or imperial.

Business Dinner with a set menu. Excellent choice by the organizer. The dishes I remember: Royal China Signature aromatic Duck and also Pan-fried Wagyu Beef Cube. Both out if this world !Service at the end of the meal did not keep up with the rhythm showed at the beginning.

Went for dinner on a Friday evening. Tried to get a booking at the Chinese restaurants at Mandarin or Pan Pacific but was fully booked but Royal China had availability. We got there and it was pretty much empty. We ordered the duck.the duck was very dry and cold...had so much better. They cut the slices into big chunks and was not tasty at all. We ordered chilli oil to add some taste to it. I asked them why are there so many flies around the table, the manager goes 'probably because of the chilli oil, we have already spoken to pest control about this' This completely put me off, The manager didnt care and just said sorry. We also ordered the beef with brocolli dish..the beef was very bad quality. Would never go back there again, no wonder if was empty
5
There are two seatings for lunch during week-ends: one at 11 am and another at 1.30 pm. It is not a very big place but the decor is pleasant: white with tiffiny blue. Service is pleasant enough and dim sum is served quite quickly. The dim sum is tasty and we enjoyed it very much. We paid $86 for 4 of us
5
We come here all the time for weekend dim sum. It's one of the best in Singapore. The food quality remains unchanged - always good and delicious. The menu contains a lot of variety and the food is impeccable. Service staff can be rude at times - but this is probably because they are not well trained.

We visited this place at Raffles hotel with my Asian friend. It was through a recommendation. From the outside/inside of the restaurant you have a feeling that you will spend a fortune if you go there. I must say it is not entirely true. It is not cheap, but not expensive either comparing it to restaurants of famous hotels around the world. The food and the service was top class and my friend told me that it is genuine Chinese cooking how they made the dishes. I strongly recommend to go there if you love Chinese cuisine and culture

Gone there for lunch after hearing from friends that the good is good. Reach the location around 1 plus in the afternoon. There were not many people in the restaurant, but I still have a hard time to getting the attention of the servers. There were mini serving station in the different sections of the restaurant, but , every one seems to be specialize on doing something and ignore us.When we managed to order food after seating there for 10mins, what come next was a surprised. The food was served quickly. Every Tim Sum dish came warm and nice.The quality of food is good. We had the Custard Bun, Phoenix Claw, Siew Mai , Lotus leave rice..etcEvery dish did not disappoint !While, i don't like their version of custard bun, but, all other dish was good. I will be back again
5
It great ambience, contemporary china design, very relaxing, stylish without stiffling. The great service staff and good quality food without the cost one would think you have to pay. To get this kind of setting in other cities like HK, Shanghai, you pay a lot more! Must book firs

Went here for having Dim Sum. The salted egg yolk buns were really good. Unfortunately most of the dumplings we ordered came quite overcooked/steamed and mushy. Also the carrot cake was rather soggy.
4
The ambiance here is stunning with tiffany-blue decor and it serves excellent Chinese food.
I frequent the place for its dim sum. My favourites are the Char Siew Sou, Custard Bun, and Har Gau. The restaurant’s speciality, Lobster Noodle is also a worthy mention.
5
We had lunch here with friends and we had really the best chinese lunch ever! We had duck, eggs, noodles with lobster (incredible!), green tea, sweets, everything high quality and very well cooked and presented. Optimum really.

Royal China has always been my favourite chinese restaurant. I have been coming here before and after the renovation. I love the dimsum esp the char siew bao. I dont usually like to order buns for dimsum since its bad manners if you are treating guests (stuff them with cheap buns so they are too full to order other more expensive stuff). But this char siew bun i must order. The buns are so soft and steaming hot and the char siew is so moist and tasty. I also like the quiet ambience and the attentive service. Its great to bring guests here since it never disappoints. For dinner, i love their chicken broth shark fin soup (not sure if they still serve now). It is cook to perfection. Their crispy duck however can be abit dry but when you wrap with sweet sauce they are still quite good. I also like the mango sago dessert, the osmanthus jelly, aloe vera dessert. Royal china is the place to go to get authenic great chinese food

On our last trip to Singapore 9yrs ago we ate here & had a very nice meal. It was on this basis that we decided to dine here again on this trip..... We shouldn't have bothered. This was very expensive & tasteless. There was only one element of our meal that we could say was enjoyable. When we return to singapore we will not go back to this restauran

I ate here whilst staying at Raffles. If staying at Raffles there are better Raffles restaurants on the complex.I felt the food was very expensive and quality didn't live up to the price. Staff were not particularly approachable or helpful and service was unacceptably slow and unhelpful, especially considering they charge for a service charge. Below is further detail.There were only 2 other groups of diners there when I was there in November, which meant no real atmosphere.If you don't eat fish/seafood, there is a more limited choice. One of the dishes I wanted to order came garnished with fish. I asked if I could have the order without the fish on it, but this was not possible. I ended up just ordering a meat dish with rice. The portion of rice was tiny. I asked for more rice for which I was charged for the extra portion (GBP9 per portion) and had to wait 15-20 minutes for it, so my meat dish to accompany it was cold by the time it arrived. Quality of the meat in the dish was not great, especially considering the price.Wouldn't recommend this place. If you want to eat on the Raffles complex, recommend steakhouse instead

I visited this Restaurant on the 3rd floor at the Raffles Complex for the first time. Being a fan for Dim Sum, I was blown away with the quality and standard of the dishes which my daughter and I choose. Every dish tasted different, it never repeated. I only could highly recommend this pearl of Restaurant with very good service. On top of it, it was not pricy at all, very reasonable! As well I would like to mention, with the Air con running on high speed, take a shawl or cardigan along. It was very cool inside the Restaurant and make a reservation. But surely on my next visit, I'll be there again!

First thing first, if I had read the reviews before heading down to Royal China in tripadvisor, I wouldn't have chosen to dine there given the negative reviews that I see here. The place was suggested by a colleague who felty that he could get better quality dim sum versus the dim sum at Sichuan Court over at Raffles City (just opposite Raffles Hotel). In fact I had high expectations given that it's in Raffles. Hotel.The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of Raffles Hotel. Being a first timer, I wasn't able to locate the signage leading to the restaurant and have to ask one of the staff in the hotel for directions. Once you get inside the old lift, you can then see that it's located on level 3.We went there for lunch on a weekday. I was rather surprised that the restaurant opens exactly at 12 noon instead of the usual 11am / 1130am with most chinese restaurants. There were already some people on business meetings waiting outside the restaurant. Having made a reservation, I was promptly shown to my seat.The restaurant was not very crowded. The restaurant is not your typical crystal Jade / imperial treasure where you see the hustle and bustle. It's pretty quiet and more of like fine dining... Umm.. Ambience more like The Humble House ran by Tung Lok. I think on a weekday, kids will seem out of the place especially as they are usually more active.Let's talk about the food. Dim sum basket cost on average around $5.6 per basket. Indeed the quality and price were of much better value than Sichuan Court ... Sichuan court dim sum are exorbitant with average quality... The siew Mai was tasty with fresh prawns and the fried beancurd roll was very crunchy too! Fried carrot cake was excellent and is a must try. One of their recommended dish is their Seafood Crispy Noodles. Unlike the typical '生面' that you find in Cze Char stalls in Singapore, their noodles were pressed and then shaped into a circle. It's like a thin round circle of noodles topped with seafood. Excellent texture and is a must try! The noodles cost $24 which is reasonable too.We did not experience any staff chasing us and in fact no one even bothered us when we carried on chatting after we had finished our lunch. Our teapot was also refilled promptly.This review is based on my first time experience to Royal China and I was in fact planning to go to the restaurant with my husband to try the other dim sum that I have missed. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? When I first arrived, there were few patrons, it does feel a bit awkward given the 'grandness' of the place... Actually I prefer a more 'relax' kind of restaurant, not the fine dining - dressed up type. When I called to make a reservation, I requested for a nice quiet table but was informed that it's lunch time, the restaurant will be crowded anyway... (often the practice will be to inform the customers that they will try their best).Frankly the quality of the food and service do not warrant the negative comments that I see here. I also noticed that most of them were made in 2013, maybe there was a change in management? - I don't know. Perhaps I will find some time to visit on a weekend with my family and will update here.Lastly, for visitors, if you want a bustling chinese restaurant that also serves dim sum, just head over to Asia Grand @ Odeaon Towers. (also opposite Raffles Hotel

I cannot believe that a fine dining restaurant in an iconic hotel such as the Raffles can provide such shockingly horrible and rude service. Firstly, our supposed waitress hurried us on our order selection claiming the kitchen will run out of food soon with a expression on her face that said she really could not give a damn. Then when the first order arrived, the buns were ice cold! The kitchen did not even bother to microwave the damn things! Trying to get them to warm it up brought more sour looks from the staff with not even a single apology! They brought us a bun short claiming they ran out and will not charge us for the ONE bun (OMG we should all bow down and thank the service gods for this amazing piece of hospitality.) Trying to get the waitress' attention was more difficult than hailing a cab in midtown manhattan on a cold and rainy afternoon.The food? - meh...I've eaten better at standard dim-sum places in Singapore for one-fourth the price and one tenth the aggravation.Raffles - get your act together and put in some actual quality assurance to uphold your high standards. What a waste of money, time and appetite

I tried the afternoon tea just to let my mother to experience the renown afternoon tea. However, I was more than disappointment to the quality and the varieties of choices. The staff were too little to cater enough service for the guests. I had to call several times for refilling my tea. The dim sum was awful and the choices was so limited that I really feel regret for trying this afternoon tea.
