Don't drink don't go that's was how the boss operate his izakaya. We had a good time there, not too pricey.

Nobuya in Fortune Centre offer very similar Japanese style food where you need to order drinks for each.

Refused to have a table for my family to dine simply saying "with child, you are not my customer"!! He did not say anything like "sorry" or that kind! What an extremely rude attitude! It made our dinner time terrible experience!
非常に失礼な店主に子供がいるというだけで失礼な言い回しで追い返されるという大変嫌な思いをさせられました。酒を飲まない者は追い返すという下らないポリシーに怒りを覚えました。大人だけで入ったとしてもきっと嫌な思いをさせられることと思います。

Atmosfare, style and foods are all Shinbashi-style. Staffs are very kind and quick in service. Foods are all fine.

Stumbled upon this Izakaya a while back but didn't patronise the place till this month. Most of the menu consists of small bites and cold dishes, with a few mains. For the two of us we ordered: Chicken KaarageFried SquidMaguro DonCold Soba NoodlesFried Mushrooms Everything was done really well, though portions were relatively small - we finished everything I think it was just nice. Beer was really good too - Sapporo, super cold and refreshing. Had no problems with service. Would definitely go back - soon!My only gripe was that it was a little pricier than I thought it would be (given that portions are small) - our chicken kaarage cost $18 for 8 delicious pieces

We arrived on a Friday at 5.55pm. We had no reservations BUT the restaurant was completely empty and just about to open at 6pm. We asked a young waiter ... he was obliging BUT before he could complete his sentence this very rude Japanese man came right up to my face (violated my personal space) and in a sputtering of English shouted "no booking no space, no booking no space! lifted his hands to my face (literally 5cm from my face) and wave the NO gesture. To my face! Never once did he look me in the eye to explain. What rudeness and arrogance success can bring to you when you think your establishment has made it! So I guess you need to book folks But I'm stepping here again. There are lots of places like these in Singapore. Don't waste your time here!Victor Lim, Singapore Citizen

Its an Izakaya so dont expect ambience of a restaurant. Most guests will be enjoying sake and food outside the outlet. Good selection of variety of sake including junmai daijingou. Sashimi fresh but small pieces. Fresh oysters popular so sold out quickly. We just choose from 1 page list of chef's recommendations. Most items are small but inexpensive. Most of your cost will be from sake which is mandatory in order 2 patronise the outlet. See pic of owners' aim for the outlet

We went in a large group on a Tuesday evening and the place was alive and buzzy, with tables spilling out onto the corridors of the shopping center outside the restaurant. It's a multicultural crowd with locals and Japanese as well as Western expatriates. Everyone seemed to be drinking and having a good time. We tried many dishes but not the sashimi. What we tried was not mind blowingly good but above average for an izakaya in Singapore, at reasonable prices. The sake though was rather pricey. Will give it another try.

I was impressed and sweep away by the service that my date set. It was amazing Authentic Japanese Restaurant as my current partner suggested. The service was brilliant and exclusive despite a small place that most local may think! But i was flattered with the courtesy of the owner and staffs.Food was delicious! Oishi! I will definitely be back here cause I love the little cozy place and I suppose my partner won my heart by showing me the beauty of Japanese culture.Thank you very much for the courtesy treatment for my trip, my partner previous trips and upcoming!

Really authentic Japanese food coupled with a range of sake and draft beer. If you want to reserve a table, just say Yes to Drinking? when asked on the phone

It is quite unique Izakaya style in Singapore. Very simple menu & simple ambience with good sake. Price is also reasonable. You have to drink & there is no soft drinks in the shop. But nice experience.

Nobu-Ya is a nice small secluded Japanese restaurant with traditional food. In this restaurant, every guest Must drink something as it's their tradition but it's worth as the food were exceptional where you don't get any where

Totally reminds me of an authentic izakaya back in Japan. The idea that everyone has to drink is just brilliant for people who appreciates a good sake.
Will be back.

Even tough we had been told upfront that the owner was severely rude, he managed to beat our expectations in a negative way. We had booked the table at 8.30pm because he told us there were no table available by 8pm, but then when we got there we complained about us getting there by 8.30pm rather than 8pm. Moreover, he gave us a table well outside the restaurant and he made jokes about it. Honestly, unless you are Japanese, I'd recommend you to spend your money somewhere else

This hole in a wall izayaka has its charms. It is unpretentious, serves really good food and drinks, and it is reasonably priced. And if you go near closing time (at about 9.30pm), you get extra serving of everything because the chef does not want to have leftovers. The produce is fresh and cooked with pride. Ordinarily, I would give such an establishment 5 stars. I mean, where in Singapore can one find delicious authentic Japanese food, cooked by Japanese cooks, frequented by Japanese people at such a reasonable price?But surely, I should not eat with fear in my heart that I may inadvertently anger the chef/owner, which is what I felt throughout my meal. I learnt, in my first visit, from the look of sheer terror in the waitress' eyes, that I had to order an alcoholic drink in order to be served food. Can my partner order two drinks, and I none? Can we order a bottle of sake for one which costs more that three drinks combined? Can I have my drink after my meal and not with my meal? "No, no, and no," she says in a low voice while taking quick peeks at her boss to gauge his mood. "You have to order an alcoholic drink now, ma'am." Boss looks over and is about to kick us out when I relented and ordered an alcoholic drink.I look at boss man who surveys his restaurant sternly, and then he booms to another patron, "did you order a drink? No drink? No food." And I think Soup Nazi from Seinfeld.In summary, come here to eat, make sure you order your alcoholic drink, do not offend the boss by smiling at him (he does not smile back), do not think you are supporting his business (he is doing you a great favour by serving you decent food), do not imagine that your review will have an effect on how he conducts his business (sometimes, bad service does bring in more customers)

Had a great time at this small and cozy restaurant that brought back memories of a recent trip to Tokyo, and dining isakaya style! The food and drink (we had sake and Sapporo beer)were wonderful. The service was excellent too, with great recommendations from the menu. Would definitely go back again

Most dishes were fabulousI highly reccomend the wasabi octopus the snail and the tempura puffer fishGreat value for the quality Simple iZakaya style with a vibrant atmosphere Be prepared that it is like the izakayas in Japan Good value I had a 720 ml bottle of sake and a small carafe with countless dishes for $150 per person Will be bac

I've been there 3 times and service was ok. But my 4th time there made me stop going altogether. The boss was rude and condescending. Food's great, no doubt, but the whole experience with the boss was such a downer that I'm never going there again

Short and long of our experience tonight is that we didn't eat or drink what we had ordered. $74 paid for but not touched. Left feeling like we got slapped.Reason being- restaurant owner is simply too proud to even listen to their customer. Two days in advance, we had booked a table for 5. Over the phone we were asked "are you drinking?" So we answered yes. After ordering food, we were bluntly told that the restaurant policy is each and every diner had to drink. We were told we already knew over the phone. We tried to explain the booking conversation. Owner showed us his palm "No arguing". Can we buy a bottle of sake to make up for two out of five who can't drink? Showed his palm and pointed to A4 sign. We paid and left without eating nor drinking. He wasn't proud enough to reject my payment of $74. We ate here before a year back and there wasn't such a policy. The restaurant owner could do better with treating people with basic politeness. We came looking forward to a good izakaya meal but left more than empty
