Food was amazing. Could not believe there was no meat or fish served.All the prawns and meat balls which tasted fabulous were vegetarian.Presentation was perfect.It was a little expensive but well worth it.Will always return when
I stop over on my way back to Europe
5
We came here and shared the vegan gyoza and the vegan shiitake sushi roll both were delicious and I thought the pricing was so cheap, especially for Singapore! Highly recommend coming here.
5
This is one of my favourite vegetarian places to eat in singapore. Love all of their dishes but i must add they are expensive.
For the taste and quality...well worth it.
5
Excellent vegetarian food. Tried few things and all were amazing. No need to think twice :)
Reasonably priced.

Japanese vegetarian food that is presented as nicely as any other Japanese cuisine. Matched with greens and other vegetables. Not at all dull. Worth a visit.
3
This is a Japanese restaurant with no meat on the menu.Even the sushi , unagi, meat on ramen are all fake !But presentation is appetising.Service and ambiance is ok, lighting a little on the dark.side .We preferred the real vegetables such as green salads and vegetable tempura and the mushroom dishes on the menu to the artificial flour imitations of fish and pork.This place is ok for first experience but I am not sure if I will go back 
5
Absolutely incredible plant based restaurant tucked into the Fortune Centre right next to one of the entrances. Vast variety of dishes that look and taste as delicious as the pictures. Ordering is done on an iPad and the speed of service is mind blowing. Very reasonably priced and very close to other attractions. All round perfect evening.
5
Cute little place in fortune center and by far my favorite place there, if not my favorite place in the entire city. You order by iPad which allows you plenty time to look at pictures for every menu item. Specify vegan in the notes sections. We ordered the unagi sushi roll, katsu curry and dumplings. All were delicious. I wish I had more than 1 day in Singapore because I would have went there multiple times to try more things on the menu. Excellent!

My friends arrived earlier last Friday and even though the staff initially said the busy restaurant did not accept reservations on weekends, they relented after my friends showed the staff a Messenger correspondence between me and a staff in Nov, stating that they got my reservation. The Jap food menu was quite extensive, although the burger choices were limited. We ordered 3 different maki and all were great! I also ordered the katsu curry with rice and I liked that it was spicier than the usual Japanese curry. The sashimi was the most interesting: it had the texture of koniyaku jelly or chewy agar but the colour of boiled carrot and tasted like fresh salmon! It was really amazing. I especially liked the maki and tempura. The 3 different maki has unique sauces and flavours, and came with a variety of textures in a bite. The tempura was crunchy and fresh. The only thing could be improved was the service. After I called for the bill twice, the staff acknowledged my request but did not act on it. One of my friends had to leave early so we became anxious, wondering why our bill took so long to come when we noticed that many staff were just standing around (one of them was already informing other customers that the kitchen was closing so last orders were being taken). Turns out, nobody processed our bill at all. Another minor issue was that our tiny drinking water cups were not refilled throughout our dinner and only refilled after the staff processed our bill. Nonetheless I still liked the dining experience in spite of the minor billing service issue. But will I return?

Ive walked past this restaurant many times but never really thought much about what it was u til last night. I realised it was vegetarian and have always liked vegetarian food so decided to try it. I’m so glad I did. I really enjoyed the teriyaki chicken bento box meal. All vegetarian and tasted amazing. Was actually a very big and filling meal for bento size. I’ll be visiting this place again when I visit Singapore
5
Cant begin to express my love for this place. Try it all and come again and try more. My fave is the vegetarian unagi
5
I eat here twice...i must say the best asian food ever loved it would highly recommend
The stuff is also very kind
4
Enjoyed some nice vegan sushi - and the restaurant has a menu card that is vegan / vegetarian friendly.
5
I have just finished my meal and the ladies who served me were lovely, and really helpful. They explained the most popular dishes and I opted for the pan fried gyoza first and then unagi maki. Both were extremely tasty and fresh! I would have taken a picture of the gyoza (which are an in house recipe), but they were demolished in seconds.Well worth a visit
5
This is my second visit to Herbivore and the food variety and quality is simply outstanding. They have such huge variety to choose from and every dish is unique in its own way. I will have to make a few trips to taste all the dishes they serve. For someone who is a vegetarian I feel such restaurants make us feel inclusive as there was no other way I could have tasted some yummy Japanese food. Highly recommend all vegetarians to go down and taste the food
3
I'm really not sure about Herbivore. I just popped in as have been wanting to try. As a vegetarian I love eating vegetables, I celebrate eating a healthy plant based diet . Herbivore is vegetarian and some dishes vegan but most comprise of mock meat which I'm not sure about. Even the sushi is mock fish made from sushi. I had a the Soba Set that comprised of mushrooms in a gravy like soup, with super soft noodles, a tasteless mock omelette and mushrooms plus a little salad covered in a mock what seemed like a Marie Rose mayo plus 2 pieces of fried food that seemed like a tomatoes and mock meat filling. I didn't want to try. If you like mock meat you are in heaven but for me no thank you.
4
Our second Japanese vegetarian restaurant visit in Singapore. The menu was an iPad which was locked every time we wanted to order (making us wonder why automate the process of ordering when the waiter needs to unlock the system when we want to order.) The items were good and the waitress explained each of the item on the menu. The food was good and the tea varieties they have here are excellent. Definitely recommend if you are vegan/vegetarian and would like to try Japanese food
5
This place is awesome! It's so nice to have the freedom to choose anything on the menu! The food was delicious and I really enjoyed all the different way they cooked and formed their protein alternative, really awesome concept. The restaurant is quite packed and it's quite little, staff was really efficient but not so friendly but the food did it for me! Would def go back on my next visit
2
After reading the reviews on tripadvisor we went here for lunch. Now quite frankly I don't understand the concept of mock meat because we are vegetarian for a reason. Maybe this place is meant for people who've turned vegetarian or miss meat. My wife & I ordered 2-3 dishes and had to leave after taking a bite of each. Not only does the mock meat look like meat it smells like meat as well (sea food kind of a smell) making the entire experience unbearable for us. We paid our bill and left for another restaurant
4
As a vegetarian, this is a place I frequented. It is located in Fortune Center, widely regarded as the vegetarian hub of Singapore, at the corner of Waterloo Street, next to the famous Kwan Yi Temple. Food here is good and reasonably priced with huge serving size. I like the bento set, Japanese curry chicken/fish rice, avocado sushi, and the jelly. My son like to order with their iPads. Two things you have to take notes, first, serving size is quite big, please come with more people or order less. Secondly, the restaurant is quite small and popular. Better come here early or you might need to wait for a long time.
5
I've been ordering from here for a couple years and its hands down the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore! Spicy ramen set is a favourite! :)
5
We both had bento boxes and they were outstandingly good. No cheap but not expensive either, for Singapore. A very popular place with locals. Highly recommended if you are staying nearby.
5
One of the best vegetarian restaurants that I have eaten in Singapore! It serves huge portion with specially prepared ingredients. My favourite is the cheese mushroom! :) Highly recommended to all who want to try vegetarian food!
4
Came back here for lunch today for the first time in quite a while. Opted for a bento consisting of miso ramen and gyoza. All quite tasty. Surprisingly empty at lunchtime.
3
It was my man's birthday dinner, so we went. Firstly they seated us next to the door (ugh) so we requested for a change. Done. We sat at the middle table that has four seating. We ordered unagi bento set and soba set with salmon sashimi plate. Unagi set was two Beancurd with sauce. I was expecting mock meat and was disappointed. My soba was a comforting bowl of noodles. Unfortunately, the waitress asked if I should move to opposite my man ( as we were seated side by side to each other) to make space for other customers. However, even after finishing my food, there were no other customers seated beside my man.( so why the move). Food was on the pricey side, but at least my man likes it. (Virgin Japanese vegetarian experience 
5
Hi,I visited Zen Herbivore restaurant once. I ordered Unagi don and a sushi... Food was super delicious... This is a vegetarian restaurant... Though on menu you will find chicken , fish and meat but that's all fake meat... Staff was very courteous.I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking to Japanese cuisine.Regards,Prakash Matuwan
5
This restaurant is 100% vegetarian and the vegetarians will surely relish this place and love the food. Just visited this restaurant the third time and this time tried something different apart from their curry and rice set. It is the spicy ramen set with noodles,gyoza(dumplings) with pickles served separately. The noodles come in a soup form. It may look similar to the local dish laksa but is completely different in taste. These set meals are apt for 1 person. Really enjoyed the food once again. It's Japanese vegetarian food which you may not find anywhere in Singapore. Recommende
5
An extensive vegetarian/vegan menu with wonderful Japanese dishes. There are also a selection of western dishes for the not-so-adventurous. The computer menu makes it easy to 'see' exactly what you are ordering. Flavours were very good with friendly service. We revisited Herbivore as we enjoyed the first meal so much. Hint: try the gyoza
5
My wife and I have been to Herbivore a couple of time and love the food. The menu is really extensive and food delicious. They do a great job with the mock meat. Our favorite dish is the meatball sushi. It's a really odd sounding dish but tastes awesome! The bento box options are really good as well as are the noodle dishes.
5
True blue vegetarian delight!It is a must try place( even for those who do not have a palette for mock meat).We enjoyed our Unagi Stir Fry Bento set lunch.Each portion was appealing & appetising.Loved the "Kurogoma"(black sesame) ice cream.Very friendly staff and the service is very good
4
It has good variety of choices, reasonable price range with good ambience.
It's a good place to meet up with friends or families gathering as well.
4
Its a nice place for fancy meal , they accommodated me alone even though it was crowded .
I ordered for a sushi platter , thought slightly expensive I was happy with the experience.
I will go there again
5
We've been here several times and have been delighted with each visit. Friendly, professional service, super salads and drinks, and great main courses. These folks know what they're doing and they appear to genuinely enjoy their work. A 'must visit' in our book, regardless of whether or not you're vegan or vegetarian. A great choice for locovores and carnivores too
4
A fully vegetarian restaurant dedicated to selling japanese food is very rare in Singapore, even though Singapore has quite a vibrant vegetarian community. While japanese food fills up majority of the menu items, you can also find some western food choices. Food quality is high, but the prices is even higher. Fortune Centre is a place with many vegetarian food choices, so unless on special occasion which i need to impress my date, i will definitely give this place a skip
4
Came here the second time. We ate spicy noodle and avocado sushi and they taste great. We told the staff that we are vegan, the staff was nice to suggest vegan options or changes to the food to make it vegan. We realised that there were much lesser options and were disappointed. We were most disappointed that there was no replacement of dairy milk with plant-based milk such as coconut milk when we wanted to order cappuccino to try
5
We have frequently visit Herbivore. Their food are excellent. The restaurant also made the efforts to refresh the menu. It meant you could definitely find something new to try on every visit.During our last visit, a tourist ordered a lot of food and shared with us that she wanted to try more on her last day in Singapore
3
This place is very popular during evening, especially weekend. So come early if you dont want to wait for an hour because they dont accept reservation. I like the avocado sushi, the bento set, Shitake mushroom, & the Japanese curry rice. My son loves here because he get to use tablet for ordering. Price is reasonable considering the serving size is huge, you could order 2 main and shared for three pax
3
This place is the new restaurant of the old recommended Zen which we found on happy cow app. Unfortunately we found that out after going there once and not founding the place. They get bad remark from us for wasting our time and not being clear online about their status and new location. About the food : their substitutes for fish are made from a mix of highly processed materials like tofu, beans fremmented soy and other. We didn't like it and felt a little bed after we ate this. For a vegetarian or vegan there were no options for strictly veggies rolls and that's a shame. We also tried the avocado salad which was great but quite expensive - 15$. To conclude : It was a nice experience, nice vibe, not nearly as good as strictly veggies rolls you find in other vegan sushi restaurants.
4
I came across Herbivore online and was excited to eat there. It was wonderful that they had so many vegetarian options, but the prices were high! My friend and I decided to split an item and eat elsewhere. It would be a nice place to go to celebrate something special though. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and they have iPads that you order everything on, which was kind of cool. The food was delicious, but the price was a bit of a surprise for me. It was just more than I had expected. In the same mall, there are plenty of other places that you can eat for much cheaper.
4
Went for Sunday lunch. Decor a bit dark, cold and quite small. So not a romantic or business lunch setting like Original Sin would be. Food is delicious. The bentos and tempura, the tofu and aubergine appetisers are lovely. The cost came as a surprise given that all is vegetarian. Texture of the curry and ramen 'meat' was good but we are not big on veggie food that wants to taste like meat
5
The food is beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I would certainly eat more vegetarian meals if they were cooked this creatively. I had the "unagi (eel)" bento and it almost tasted as if I was having the real thing.
3
I would recommend this place if you are a vegetarian or love vegetables of all sort. Sorry, the fake meat, fake Unagi, fake prawns etc doesn't taste like the real stuff. I personally didn't enjoy it as I prefer meat with my meals :-).
5
If you like the taste of Japanese Vegetarian, go no where. At Herbivore, you cannot expect anything better! Price is above average thou, the ambience there is also nice.
5
An expensive dining place as compare to the rest of other restaurants in the same building, but worth a few visits.
4
Excellent place to try out Japanese food for folks who are unable to accept meat. The presentation of all the usual bentos, mock dishes etc look appetising. Slightly on the pricey side but no compromise on the real Jap cuisine flavours
5
It's not always very convenient for vegetarians to enjoy tasty food. Thankfully, my family and I had an unforgettable dining experience here.We visited this restaurant at lunchtime and ordered different kinds of Japanese food from sushi to udon. What amazed us was sushi. Using fresh ingredients, sushi gave an outstanding example of delicious vegetarian food.Also, the staffs were very friendly and helpful. They even guided us the direction of our next destination after our meal. I'd love to recommend this restaurant to people who crave for palatable vegetarian sushi
5
we ordered the shiitake-makis without mayonnaise to make it vegan. they were just amazing! we also had tofu with veggies and a vegan bento. the dishes are not marked with a vegan-label but the staff is very helpful. the only thing i did not like was the drinking menu... lots if very sweet (and arificial?) fruit drinks.
5
There are limited Japanese Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore and this happens to be one of the best and pioneer branch in Singapore. There are large variety of food ranging from noodle, rice, sushi, bento, appetizer and dessert. So when we had to place order, we were spoiled for choice.Restaurant with a nice ambiance. A/c is a bit cold
4
My bestie had been reviewing vegetarian spots in Fortune Centre and my first visit with her did not do a great job of convincing me that they could adequately replace the taste of food with meat elements (I'm a new vegetarian).Herbivore does a pretty close job of getting that taste as well as feeling.I had the unagi don set, as well as a salmon temaki roll. More than good enough for someone who's not a connoisseur of Japanese cuisine but has eaten plenty of it in his lifetime. The location was pretty average but it was cosy enough and the area was a quiet one.This is a place I will return to again, a place that I will take the trouble to leave home to visit
5
This place is located on Middle road. Photos of all items are displayed on the menu which is very good. Food quality is consistent & good. There are very few Japanese vegetarian restaurant in Singapore and this is one of the few. Costing wise like any Japanese restaurant the prices are on the higher sid
4
So many options, it's great.
I ordered many different dishes, and all were either good or very good.
FYI - it's also located in a small mall - where there are many other vegetarians restaurants and shops.
5
As a vegatarian I think this is one of the nicest places I ate in. This is a good combination Japanese-vegetarian! Finally a chance to try japanese food because usually it contains sea food..
5
The food at herbivore remains excellent - we have been here multiple times , and the variety, taste and texture of the food continues to be consistent and good.
4
good food....and if you find the mock meat names unappetising, just order on the iPad thru the perfect pictures that describe the food really well....
4
A really great Japanese Style vegetarian cuisine! Loved it! Offered wide range of selection from awesome bento set, tasty sushi maki to good cold somen!However, service level not so consistent as i have visited the restaurant 3 times in a week during my Singapore trip. Service received average, and the staff sometimes seems rushing to close even not near to closing hours yet. Nonetheless, Herbivore is a cool restaurant which i will return and will not get bored wth the food selection! Keep it up
4
great veggie food. really easy to order on the ipad attached to your table. dont be fooled that there is meat on the menu. for some reason its labelled as chicken or bacon and is in fact the veggie variant.friendly staff and very helpful to make suggestions on what to eat.the avocado salad with sesame dressing is lovely, the gyozas came with a great ginger sauce.i went twice and enjoyed both experience
5
I stumbled into this restaurant while walking around in the Bugis area. Finding vegan food in Singapore isn't trivial so I was really grateful to have found this place. When I got seated the waitress kindly drew my attention that the meals on the menu were all vegetarian, I was so happy to hear that. Choosing food is really high-tech you have to make your choice online using a tablet provided by the restaurant. I ordered avocado salad and stir fried vegetables in some sauce, and it was delicious. It's a little pricey though compared to other restaurants in Singapore
4
Quick service, clean location, prices fair. We had two bento boxes and each was more than filling - with a little food untypically left behind as we were already full. I can't say anything stood out as spectacular, but i also have no complaints and would recommend it if it was on a list of options in your area
3
Stumbled across this place on a rainy Friday afternoon and decided to head inside for a late lunch. The menu is extremely diverse and covers a wide selection of Japanese & Chinese cuisine, with all 'meat' dishes made up of soya / textured vegetable protein derivatives.The food was good, not great, and the portion sizes were adequate.Upon going to pay for the meal, I was a bit surprised to see a service fee. When the waitress seated us, we were asked to input out order via a tablet stowed within the table - so I wonder what service did they provide (other than brining the food to / taking the plates from the table) that justified such a charge?Overall it was an ok meal, albeit overpriced; we won't be going back
5
Came for a birthday with my wife, been here in the past with family. Ambience is very authentic zen style. Restaurant is big and nice, gets crowded and has waiting line during peak hours to avoid. Their ordering is fully iPad based and all their dishes have picturesFoodAmazing - avocado sushi, this is a must for those that like sushi, its very fresh and texture is really tasty. The chilli chicken also was really good, texture not too chewy and flavour is very good. Another dish is the tom yam fried rice which is very authentic and tasty. Yam rolls also are a must try. Avocado salad was good, very authentic strong sesame taste.Good- The olive fried rice was alright, nothing too much to brag about. Burgers were good but can be improved. The mix plate sushi was good, but not worth the price to pay for. Overall the food and experience was really good. Their wasabi is very tasty and fresh. Birthday celebration the restaurant was very accommodating. Price factor is a abit on the high side. Estimate $35 a person for a couple and $28 when we had gone with a group of four. Definitely worth a try
4
this is on the ground floor of fortune centre. it is completely veg . sushi is worth trying and also the fried rice is nice. they have a lot of veg options and worth a try.
4
Am not a vegetarian but from the moment I saw this on Trip Advisor, I wanted to try it. Am glad I managed to visit the place and it's defo living up to its billing! Would love to eat there again...
4
Small and simple place serving tasty, healthy and hygienic vegetarian food.
Friendly staff, comfortable seating and reasonable price.
Recommended for all veggies in or visiting SG.
4
This place has really really great japenese bento sets, and my favourite part is truely the side dishes. Amazing value at $18++ for the most affordable set with 5 sides and a lovely main.
5
When the manager said they had vegetarian sushi I was pretty skeptical but it was awesome. The entire experience from the ambiance,soft music, interactive menu, and friendly service. How am I only just discovering this place?? Can't wait to back.
4
Vegetarian food has limited options in Singapore, so this Japanese vegetarian restaurant was quite a find! The food didn't disappoint and offers a wide variety. Fortune Center as a commercial building looks a little run down from he outside, but who cares.. the ambience and food at herbivore is great.
5
Herbivore remains one of my go to restaurants for special occasions. It has an excellent range of Japanese vegetarian dishes and a feast for the senses. Good ambiance and service. Tip: Avoid the sashimi - vegetarian sashimi may look the part, but tastes bland. (Not a fault with Herbivore, I've never found palatable vegetarian sashimi anywhere
4
A very Unique Japanese vegan dining experience. Food was great. Staff were attentive. Loved the ambience. Loved the wide range of variety there. Fast and prompt service. Presentation too was great. I was fooled by the look of the sashimi.However pricing was a bit stee
4
We had lunch here after searching for the restaurant on the street front; it's located on the ground floor of a commercial building with many other restaurants. We ordered 3 different dishes that cost about SGD15 each. There was actually too much food for 2 people but 2 dishes probably wouldn't have been sufficient. We asked for a fruit drink without ice and were told it would be $1 extra because we'd get more drink. It's the first time anyone has ever suggested that; we declined the offer. The novelty is checking the menu and placing your order on a pad that is on every table.The meals were served within about 20 minutes of ordering and were all tasty.
5
This is a vegan restaurant and the staff is happy to let you know that the "chicken" on the menu is cruelty free. After reassuring her we knew we dove into their extensive menu. We tried a variety of things and my non-vegan companion said the food was some of his favorite on the tri
5
Loved the ambience and the food. Paradise for vegans and vegetarians.
Very near to my hotel in center of bencoolen street.
4
When I found on Japanese vegetarian food i went there on last week. And I try shushi. And food is really good. Ambience is also gud.
4
We visited this restaurant on our recent stopover in Singapore. My partner is Vegan & I was going meat free, so with all the good reviews on Trip Advisor it was an obvious choice. (Especially as our hotel was just down the road.) We really enjoyed our meal. Service was attentive & timely. Menu choice was interesting & varied. Prices were OK (we had also been eating at Hawkers Markets so the price differential was noticeable). Overall a good value meal. We would certainly recommend to other travellers & would have no hesitation in eating there again on another visit to Singapore. Overall pretty good value, not blow your socks away, but good value
4
Herbivore has diverse and excellent food options for a vegetarian. They have well prepared options for vegetarian who avoid processed meat and tasty options who like the faux meat as well. The key difference between Herbivore and other vegetarian restaurants truly is the visual presentation of food; catering to those who treat food as edible art. This makes Herbivore stand out. While the chefs are great, the wait staff are unremarkable: polite but sometimes distracted. They've adopted this ipad ordering system a year ago which is helpful, but perhaps a bit complicated. I like it, but other guests I've been with prefer a waiter so they can ask questions or ask for minor modifications.The only reason I dock a point is frankly the ambiance. Although the inside is fitted out nicely and they position themselves as high end price-wise, the restaurant is located in a mid-low market vegetarian mall which is a bit dingy. Further, they sometimes ask customers to dine outside, which is adjacent to a convenience store and a busy road. Not exactly cozy or romantic outdoor seating. If you can't get a table inside, not sure the visit is worth it, no matter how good the food is
5
We went here for dinner one evening and liked it so much we came back a few days later. The food was excellent, service was good and prices were reasonable. We were seated near a window, and a woman passing by saw me struggling with my chopsticks. She came into the restaurant and tried to show me how to use them. Then she started talking about her ex-boyfriend's mother and other personal things, and we couldn't get rid of her! She finally left, and I finished my meal using a fork
4
Loved my experience at this restaurant. It was super quick service, menus on tablets which made it easy and convenient to order without asking for waiters to attend every single time for a new order. I would avoid the local cuisines. I thought the Japanese flavours were bang on and of course a perfect place for vegetarians to eat "salmon" sushi
4
We are being a vegetarian , first time tried japanese food. It's hard to find Japanese vegetarin food. The quality of food is good especially Bento set. We didn't reserve just walked in but able to get table without much difficulty. The staffs are very friendly and service is very quick. The price wise bit high but worth to visit especially for vegetarian
2
One would think that it cannot go wrong with vege sushis. Well, it can. While stir fried pea sprouts tasted quite good, my vege sushi was really below any expectations. I mean, the rice didn't taste of rice vinegar at all and their soy sauce was super salty and otherwise tasteless. The meal was quite expensive as well. Friendly staff though. But if you want better vege sushi, there is a nearby another place across Bencoolen street, Teng Bespoke. I'd rather go there, the food there is much better
4
Took the Downtown Line out to Bugis to try the vegetarian bento boxes at this restaurant (although it's a fair hike from the MRT station). We didn't have a reservation but were able to get a table without too much difficulty, although the place was quite busy. Some of the bento boxes are fairly expensive: opted for one teriyaki fish and one teriyaki chicken (of course they are not real fish or chicken) at $22++ each. Food was quite decent and good presentation, service was average. Worth a visi
4
I just happened to walk in the restaurant is pretty close to ibis where i was staying. Though its vegetarian, I did notice fish on the menu. The food is good and the ambience is japanese. I took some recommendations from the waiter and was happy the recommendation worked out well
4
Doesn't serve eggs, really vegan but most importantly it made us doubt if what we had was actually non-meat!
Slightly pricy for an average dinner but the quality is worth the price tag!
5
Excellent vegetarian japanese food. The tom yum rice and sushi in particular. Huge variety. Can't wait to get back.
4
Name in front is Herbivore but the menu is a Japanese restaurant called Zen. Food was delicious. They consider themselves to be a vegetarian restaurant and make a big thing out of that but a restaurant that has an extensive fish menu and fish sushi is not considered vegetarian by most people. Perhaps in Singapore fish don't count as living creatures. We are not vegetarian so it didn't matter either way, but we thought it was strange that they made such a big deal about it, even asking us if we were vegetarian. No matter, the food was fresh, beautifully prepared, a fair price and we enjoyed it
4
Visited on 16/11/14 w my family. Not crowded during 12pm to 1:30pm.Now using electronic ordering same as Sunny Choice but hanged when sending orders. Staff was thoughtful, gave us 3 small plates for sharing. Ordered my favourite Cheese Shitake($15 for 6pcs)=big shitake, juicy,crispy n matches so well w cheese.Daikon Salad$12, appetising like e crispy tofu.Unagi Maki $14, fine but fine it a bit salty.Olive Rice $9, taste good not oily.Tomato Rice $12, taste like Margarita pizza.3 juices. Total $87.10 w 10% service charge n 7% GST. Overall satisfying as service is fine n i like the Cheese Shitake so much.
5
Really tasty vegetarian Asian (Chinese? Japanese?) food. I avoided the faux meat and instead had dumplings, rice, and the like. Beautifully served. I wish I could had a light beer with the food, but the place does not serve alcohol. Sweet service by very competent waitresses. Don't let the location fool you. Beautiful interiors, priced right (higher)
3
This is the second Japanese Vegetarian restaurant I have visited. The variety of food is huge. Food is good but taste could be better. The quantity of the Bento Set is large, even my big eater teenage son was filled with no need for side dish. The set contained teriyaki fish/chicken, pickles, sashimi, mashed potatoes, salad, miso soup, jelly, rice, fried calamari and stewed bean curd.I was a bit turned off to bite into burnt parts of the Teriyaki chicken. Most of the tastes were strong, that is, when it was suppose to be salty, it was a bit too strong for me, but then I prefer fine food that are lightly prepared.The chirashi set was nice tasting. Standard of food are similar to family restaurant with pricing around $16 to $35 for Bento sets.Three of us ate a chirashi set, chicken Bento set, Fish bento cost $16, $22and $22. There was a 10% service charge and 7% GST. So came up to $70.62.I was at Teng Bespoke at Sunshine Plaza last week. The food was nicer but it cost me $60 for 2 light eaters. So between the two restaurants, Herbivore for quantity and strong tasting food while Teng for smaller quantity, fine tastes. Between the 2, Teng has better sashimi in my opinion - more fresh, smell, taste and the texture better too. If you willing to splurge a little more go Teng
5
If there is one restaurant you NEED to visit in Singapore, then let it be this one.It's a sheer delight to be presented with beautifully decorated dishes but food that tastes just as good or even better.Mock meat should be done the herbivore way. Everything we tried was perfectly done and tasted just right. I won't go in detail of what we ate cos anything you try, I am sure will turn out good.What I liked:- all the platters and the katsu was especially nice.What I didn't like :- nada
5
We stopped in at Herbivore for lunch and got the chicken teriyaki bento and katsu curry sets. Both were excellent, well-presented, tasty, and filling. With drinks it came to 60SGD, which coming from the UK is about right for a restaurant meal -- others listing this place as expensive are correct in context; there are 3 other vegetarian restaurants in the Fortune Center, all substantially cheaper. However, Herbivore is the sort of place you could take a date to impress them; it's competing in a whole different niche. If I lived in Singapore I think we'd probably be back to Herbivore once a month or so

I am simply a fan of Herbivore. My whole family love the food provided by the restaurant. Staff are friendly, great ambience, good location, great food. I always bring my important clients there if I need to treat them for a meal. The standard of the food serve never fail

Went here with friends on our first night in Singapore and was blow away by the quality of good and variety in this little vego restaurant. My partner is a dedicated meat water and he agrees that it was the best meal in our 7 days (and we had lots of them!). Can recommend the sushi, teriyaki, agadashi tofu, well everything actually.

Decided to try something different in vegetarian & go a little Japanese. Surprisingly different & tasty although a little pricey.
I wouldn't have known it was vegetarian because the taste & flavours were really good.
Try it!

The food is ordered using an ipad stuck under each table which is quite fun and also easy to work out what you want using the photos - the food is also listed in English. I don't think they serve alcohol but the soda drinks are ok. The food standard is good and beautifully served by traditionally efficient Singaporian staff. Not a huge menu but enough that I struggled to narrow down the dishes that I wanted to try

My partner and I have fallen in love with Herbivore. If you’re vegetarian / vegan and miss sushi - this is the place for you. Even the carnivores we've taken there have loved it!The staff is phenomenal. We asked for no mayo on the sushi for our first visit and they immediately clicked that we were vegan and added a note to our entire order so nothing had animal products. Great peace of mind. They even remember to do this when we go back now :-)The setting is very nice with outdoor seating available. As for the food we focus more on the sushi, but they have an expansive menu. Our personal favorites are the egg plant appetizer followed by the avocado, salmon and eel sushi rolls. Just make sure you save room for the vegan green tea ice cream!It’s a good thing Herbivore isn’t walking distance from our apartment or we’d go there every night ;-)Thank you Herbivore for giving us guilt free sushi! :-

Wow, I hate vegetarian food but this totally change my view on vegan food. Whole new experience for me.Had dinner: grilled chicken, unagi and of course vegetables. Tasted like real chicken and unagi.In fact it's better than typical japanese restaurants I've.Really helpful staff took time to explain to what's a vegan all about and recommended few dishes. Well done

Visited on 29/5/2014, under my long wanted visit list...Reaching there 12pm+ still had many empty tables but after 30 mins later almost 90% of tables had been occupied...ConsOrder 3 side dishes as we afraid that we can't finished its...about 10mins 2 of e dishes have been served...we ate happlily n finished up e 2 dishes-Nasu tempura n Cheese Shitaki but our 3 Kind Maki still haven't served to us, so we checked w e waiter, then they realised that just 2 orders have recorded only so had to wait for the 3 dish...about another 10mins later then finally we had our sushi...3 Kind Maki, $10 for 18pcs, is actually sushi, just normal taste, not up to my expectation!!!ProsNasu tempura, $6 for 6pcs, is egg plant tempura is in a shape of fan,not too oily, crispy but the colours doesn't match w the photo shown on the menu...in e menu it looks very purplish...Cheese Shitaki, $15 for 3pcs,not too oily, cheese on top is slightly burn so make it very tasty Total spend $46+ for 2 persons...Overall, is a great experience will visit again as I wanted to try others dishes...like the smoke duck maki..

This was the second time I went there. I still can't believe that there were no meat at all, the vegetarian meat taste just like the real meat, great choice of sauce to make it taste fabulous. All the side goes well as a set. The dessert, pudding, help to refresh our mouth from all the heavy tasty sauce. The sushi, California roll, is the MUST to try. Everything is prefect. Except the sashimi it was like jelly, tasteless, not a single taste is similar to the real sashimi. Some set is a bit over rated, but overall it's worth it. Portion quite big, unlike some restaurant pay some yet so little.

If you are keen on experimenting and are a vegetarian-look no further!Herbivore offers some unique and delicious pure vegetarian food ranging from mock meat(soyabean) to vegetarian sushi's. Don't get confused by the names on the menu as they are inspired from the non vegetarian variant but are pure vegetarian and make use of beancurd(tofu), soya etc.For egs their vegetarian burger is known as Chicken Cheese Burger but is made of soyabean, Avocado etc.While the restaurant serves a variety of options my personal favourite are Honey Chicken.Just a word of caution this is not a typical Indian vegetarian fare and one should try only if they like to experiment and enjoy Japanese variant of vegetarian food.Located in Fortune centre(190 Middle Road,Bugis)pls do be ready to wait if you are going in peak hours(lunch 11 to 1pm or 630 pm to 8 pm on weekends). Approx SGD 25++ per person for a mea

As we were very tired one evening after a hard day sight-seeing, we decided to go the restaurant almost next door to our hotel. We soon discovered it was a vegetarian restaurant, but it wasn’t until we looked at the menu that we discovered just how vegetarian it was. We are not averse to eating vegetarian food; we occasionally eat vegetarian dishes at home. However, Zen Herbivore turned out to be a vegan restaurant. The restaurant apparently caters for the large Hindu population in that part of town. The dishes didn’t include any meat, cheese, dairy products, onion or garlic. As, the restaurant catered for mainly Hindu clients, it also didn’t serve alcohol.It was very helpful that the dishes on the menu all had pictures. There was lots of choice,but unfortunately we really didn't comprehend what the choices were. Certain dishes were titled as ‘prawn’ or ‘chicken’ and were in fact tofu. My husband opted for a Japanese set meal. It cost around 23 dollars. It was copious and very attractively laid-out on a tray with divisions. It also included a dessert. Unfortunately, he didn’t know what he was eating, as most of what was on the tray was unrecognisable to him and our waitress spoke very little English. I opted for a spicy ‘chicken’ (tofu) and stir fried vegetables. The vegetables were OK, but the tastes rather samey. The chicken substitute was not to my liking, as it was rather rubbery in texture.Though the standard of the food was satisfactory, we wouldn’t frequent the restaurant again. This is as being mainly used to European ingredients; we weren’t able to distinguish much of what we were eating. An important factor for my husband was that he wasn’t able to have a glass of beer or wine with his meal

A restaurant demonstrating that a veggie life-style is truly delicious, fantastic and authentic! A balanced collection on the menu. Choices for all. Even the non-veg person will consider changing life-style. We often eat there with the family and feel like kids in a candy shop! Staff are friendly. Very well priced to enable families to enjoy the food while not worried about the bill. Do not expect alcoholic drinks or chili-hot dishes. It is 'satvic' food as said in Sanskrit: high purity and honest food full of positive water crystals because the owner and the chefs are like that.Enjoy

If you felt that vegetarian food is meant only for specific religions and health-conscious people, this place will set you rethinking. The menu looks just like being in a japanese restaurant and the variety offered is HUGE. The atmosphere is nothing like what you felt before in vegetarian eateries at chinatown. They have even more stuff than usual restaurants I would say. And the servings are just nice and they are so exquisitely made. It's just like having bento sets. And their food is beautifully presented! And I find the prices quite reasonable
