Went on a Sunday for their lunch buffet. The food selection was limited, sashimi was precut and placed on little plates left in the open, not fresh at all. Only edible item was probably the laksa. The plates had a smell to them, like they've been wiped with a smelly cloth. Although there was a one for one promotion, We ended up paying $40+ per pax which was totally not worth it

My family of 8 was there for lunch and my hubby was not feeling well day before. We asked the manager if hubby can order ala carte and he assured us that there will be stuff hubby can eat, if not he will ask kitchen to prepare appropriate stuff for him. What excellent service! The prawn on the cold section was super duper fresh and I was pleasantly surprised with the Dilmah tea selection. Nice spacious place to have lunch. Sashimi was freshly cut.

the food is plentiful and its a great spread with seafood bar, many salad options and hot food. the desserts were not a great choice but filled me up daily
3
My wife and son had the morning breakfast and they were both satisfied. Maybe next on our next visit we may try having a dinne
4
Good selection of food available. Wished the seafood included crabs as well as there were none. Service was alright.
3
Food was still as good as the 1st time I went but the Christmas spread was not very exciting. The turkey was not carved properly but tasted alright, the honey baked ham was a little dry. Desserts were so so, wish they had more mini cakes. Overall still had a good meal for the price we paid. Can’t ask for more.
4
Attentive and friendly staff. Good ambience. Good spread of food. Find some of the food may be a little salty but this is a personal tastebud issue.
3
Cooked food tasted very average. However, chilled seafood and sashimi quite fresh.Service has plenty of room for improvement, cashier claims that she wasn’t informed that a voucher will be used, and she should have been notified earlier. Despite reservation indicating that a voucher will be used, and verbally informing at the reception area before being ushered to our seat
3
Keep your expectations in check and you wont be disappointed. The buffet spread is decent and offers a good choice of Chinese, Indian and continental choices. Nothing really stands out but is good enough to get you started. during the rush time seating etc gets chaotic but best to ignore
1
Went for 1 for 1 buffet as they advertised everywhere, but only to be told by the restaurant reception girl there is no such deal. So we turned back and crossed this hotel out on our list.
3
Visited Atrium for a gathering with friends. Restaurant clearly attracted large crowds. Service staff was fairly attentive and friendly.Quality and spread was overall very very average. The cold seafood wasn't great. The cooked food offerings were also ho-hum. And the cheese section, a little dismal. The dessert section offered very standard fare - regular chocolate and mango cakes, a chocolate fondue, and some local deserts.The only saving grace perhaps was the local food - laksa and kueh pie tee.
5
I am grateful to Yap and Rav excellent services even though their Buffet spread does not come with fried rice but they made extra effort to cook fried rice so that not to disappoint my dad . I am so amazed of their excellent customer service 
4
It's nice to have a buffet dedicated to the Christmas season complete with the décor and food choices. To top it all, it is on a one-for-one. They also have a scheme for guests to opt to pay $10 more which will go completely to the less fortunate during Christmas. All in, it's a good way to gather with friends over good value food with an opportunity to do your little bit for others
4
Nice Christmas deco and great customer service. However, not so with the spread of food. Desserts limited, rojak tasted weird, great laksa and crayfish. Prawns were very fresh. More plus points:- Many types of tea available. Gourmet coffees included in buffet price
3
Limited varieties but still acceptable. The same for the taste. Not sure about lunch and dinner but during my morning breakfast, i do faced shortage of coffee cup and kid utensil
5
Had a great experience as there was ample choice & variety of food in breakfast menu. Good quality very nice service. Staff very very friendly. And pls don’t miss on the cappuccino coffee. Ask ur server to get it for you. You will love it. Overall enjoyed.
5
Great servings, polite , friendly by Kuhan and Roy.Overall very happy and enjoy my stay.Great location and very helpfully
5
Went for the one for one buffet. Kids 12 and below free. How wonderful! Food was delicious, service staff polite

One of my enjoyable buffet lunch. This is not my first visit, but my first booking through email. I had communicate to staff on my request to have 2 big round table for 20 over person and the staff fulfill without hesitation. I would also like to give compliment to Mr Karthik, whom on the actual day, helped with all the arrangement. There are some misunderstanding on the food selection by the staff in the email and he helped to arrange for a complementary dish, out of good will. I read about some of the discouraging reviews by other advisor on the food quality, but since this is a family gathering, I value good, quality service which Mr Karthik and his team provided. It might not be the top notch cooking, but the friendliness of the staff and good service provided over ruled. Overall, I would consider this place value for money
1
The first time I went there was 3 years ago. Was not impressed. This time my expectations were higher after reading some reviews and being Deepavali, I imagine all the good places would be fully booked so I managed to reserve a table for 8 at the Atrium instantly. That was a warning. The only good thing I can say about this place is the service. The waiters were fast to take away dirty plates but the quality of the food was bad. The first thing that came to my mind was quantity but no quality, and everyone in my group agreed to that. Bak ku teh soup without ribs, tough wagyu beef (no steak knife), not fresh sashimi, some not fresh oysters, cooked food was below standard. Even the cold water served smelled funny. I ended drinking warm peppermint tea throughout. At the end of the meal, even the lattes freshly brewed from the coffee machines were bad and undrinkable. I am not going back there and will NOT recommend to anyone. Sorry that I went there and spent over $400 for a lousy buffet meal! Even at 1-for-1 offe
2
The oysters aren't fresh, neither were the crayfish. Wagyu has so much tendon in it. And the steak must have died so many times to be so tough. Even at 1 for 1, I don't think it's worth going for.
5
Food was good and decent ambience for the 1 for 1 promo price.Will patronise again for the wagyu beef and oyster
4
The food provided isn't excellent, but do have quality food such as wagu and oysters. Therefore it's average to me.
4
Quite a good spread. Salmon sushi was really fresh and crabs were so sweet. A great selection of tea. Green tea ice cream was great. The Wagyu steak was tender on the inside but a bit dry on the outside - Overall still worth eating. Steak Sauce can be improved - maybe add onions or mushroom or both

Atrium Restaurant located at 317 Outram road level 4 Holiday Inn. Offers a great international buffet to satisfy all tastes. I was extremely surprised with the modern all-day dining restaurant buffet that offers international fare alongside signature local dishes such as the famous Singapore chilli crab and Laksa. It was a mix of both some Singapore - Asian food, but also had quite good selection of western dishes. Great Laksa it taste really good, and cooked to order. The restaurant was quite busy and noisy at the time. But overall nice atmosphere, and scrumptious food .The waiters and staff was fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, visit. Great place for a sit down dinner buffet
3
A conducive to dine in. But food quality us so-so. But since its 1 for 1. The price is right. Might still recommen
5
The food is nice in taste but the spread during dinner is really impressive. They also offer quite a variety of seafoods in buffet along with multi national cuisine. A definite try
5
Food is good and staff were extremely helpful.Seafood was fresh .Thanks Frennie for the excellent service
5
Excellent customer service, specifically Jega. Good spread of food and variety. Will visit here again!

5
Excellent range of food especially this month's durian high tea buffet which is special celebrating our Nation 52 Bday. Like the excellent service from Jegathesan.

Disappointed experience. Based on the online recommendation from bloggers and 1 for 1 card promo we decided to go there for a buffet lunch to celebrate our son's birthday. Even for 1 for 1 promo the whole experience was not worth it. What can go wrong will go wrong. The food is not tasty. Sushi not fresh with weird smell. Roast meat were dry. Selection of food is not worth the price. The cafe is really warm. The chef was stationed at the laksa counter (the signature dish of the buffet) with hardly any guest visible at the restaurant yet the guest has to DIY the cooking. For authentic Sg food, you can find much tastier food at much lower price almost everywhere
5
The food and services is good. Jega provide a great service. But the sofa seats are expose to the hot sun, i hope they can do something about it.
4
All was good except the spacing between tables was squeezy especially when the diners at the next table sits as if their chairs are mounted on the floor...
4
- Good local food - Affordable price- Good customer service from Jega- Small place but lots of variety to choose from- Durian Alaska is great!- Will return agai
5
Visited the restaurant with family. Very good food and service. Special mention to Mr. Jega for his excellent service.

This is one of the worst buffet I have ever had! I was there on 26th June 2017 for Hi Tea with a few of my friends. The weird hi tea timing starts at 12pm to 3.30pm. We arrived at 1pm. Tried almost all the food like fried carrot cakes, Xiao Long Bao, Soon Kueh, fried Ee Fu noodles, honey chicken, curry chicken, prawn paste chicken and many more but all the dishes were not hot! Especially the Xiao Long Bao and soon kueh, both the skins were hard! Sashimi is not fresh too! I was at the roasted chicken station for quite a few minutes waiting to be served but the staff was busy playing with the phone! The varieties at the dessert corner was very disappointing too! Restaurant offered Poor service and quality of food! Not worth the price!!
5
It was smooth sailing from the time we reached the restaurant till we left. Fairly good experience. Highly recommended to book via Chope
4
Best charcoal grilled lobsters! Chili crabs were meaty but texture changed after being left cooked for too long. Need more soft drinks
5
We went to Atrium for the Iftar Ramadan Buffet offer. It was 1 for 1 so for about $100 for 2 people the spread was quite worth it. If it was $100/person, more improvements should be made. The service was great and the waiters n waitresses were attentive. Great job!
3
Old school local favourites star in this buffet lunch. Super crowded around the buffet counters. Seats by the windows were swelteringly hot. Decent value with 1-for-1 deal.
4
I had my dinner at Atrium restaurant, and Mr Andrew (F&B Operation Manager) was very helpful and accommodating. The food served on the buffet spread was amazingly good. The lobsters were very fresh, wide selections of food. I adored the flavours of the ice creams. Yummy.
5
The service is good and prompt and particular thanks to Janice who made special arrangement to cater to the needs of our colleague. The buffet is quite good in terms of variety and quality. Definitely a nice place to hold business dinners
2
Brought my nephew there for his birthday. Usually buffer price was 68++ but I think due to 1 for 1 promotion, they are charging $100++ per adult. We went there for the lobster unfortunately the lobster is not fresh and badly grilled. Food variety is not much. However service is awesome.
1
Seafood not fresh, especially Oysters and chili crab. overall food average. Will not visit again. l..
5
Great food and service , good choice and excellent value. Very busy restaurant but staff very attentive. Pleasant surroundings 
3
Read a several reviews on the poor service and food but the hosts who attended to us were really helpful and friendly! Besides the boiled cold prawns (which can't go wrong), other food quality is pretty mediocre, selection is short too, not sure if its done in the way to correspond to the 1-1 deal but if you had to pay the full price of SGD58++ without any promotion, its definitely not worth the visit
4
No complimentary drinks, but the rest was fantastic. Seafood was fresh with various condiments to compliment with. The musicians performance brings up the mood greatly
4
Spread was okay. But food was not fantastic. Well with 1 for 1 and kids ear for free. It's a good deal. The Bak Kut Teh was worth a try. Staff are attentive too. Good for family with young kids. They have a play corner to entertain themselves while the parents can enjoy.
3
Decided to try Buffet during 2 nights of my 10 day stay and whilst a good variety of foods on offer to cater for most palates the service was sub standard which if improved will have diners eating more in the restaurant. In room dining was much more of an enjoyable experience. The layout of the food stations was confusing and needs more orderly setup
4
Buffet choice is limited which compared to other buffet in other hotel but n complain since it is 1 for 1 . Also, My mum has feedback that cray fish is not fresh
4
Had a la carte. Just landed, first night back in Singapore and wanted something western. This was fine, no complaints. Tight on table space. Eager wait staff - dare I say over eager? Buffet would have been the better option
4
Went there for lunch with the whole colleagues.There were around 50 people from our studio, and guess what? The Atrium had a one on one promotion.So, around 60$ for two person! Hooray! What a good bargain!Tried their beef, lamb, sashimi and even local delicacies like fried carrot cake and mie siam.Quite good.. It's just the cakes, it just not my liking.Overall, it was a good experience and very recommended
3
This restaurant is very popular and was packed the day we went. Food is very good as is the service, but it can be very loud and quite busy with young children all over the place
5
Our family enjoyed the seafood buffet at this restaurant on our last day at the Holiday Inm. There was plenty of seafood to choose from but,not a lot of anything else if you only eat prawns. Could do with some more western dishes. The desserts were lovely and the 2 for 1 deal is good. Just remember to add on,all the extra taxes because they do add up
4
As a hotel guests, there are great promotions available. The Buffet while not the greatest spread, it is not something to scoff at either. The seafood are fresh and plentiful. Stuff gets refilled very fast. Best of all, as a guest, kids below 12 gets to eat for free. Certainly worth visiting this restaurant especially if you are an in-house guest
4
It was tasty buffet dinner during my stay at the hotel...sea food Chinese dishes were excellent..Indian selection wasn't that great and continental selection had lesser varieties but overall it was good dinner..
