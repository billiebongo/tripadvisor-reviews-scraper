Had visited this place a few times with different groups of friends. We enjoyed the food as they were served to us by staff in a hygiene manner. Soup bases such as tom yam and chicken tonic are yummy too.

Typical hotpot place. Nothing exceptional about it, but not much complaints. Variety is normal, soup bases are normal.

Good selection of meat and veggies. I like the tom yum and laksa soup base. Price wise not as pricey as the other steamboat restaurants.

We only had a 2 night stopover in Singapore and decided to walk to have dinner at the Tiong Bahru markets but they were closed for cleaning. A friendly local suggested a few surrounding restaurants and we randomly chose Le Le Pot. The staff(or owner) was very helpful and explained how dinner worked with the buffet. The steam boat was fresh, tasty and filling. The price was very reasonable. Thanks for your hospitality
