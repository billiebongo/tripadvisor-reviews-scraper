Stumbled onto this hot pot venue! Can choose Chinese, shabu shabu or sukiyaki!! Ordered the beef shabu shabu for 2! And the generous portion is more than enough for 3-4 persons! Will be back soon!

By far one of the best Japanese Hot pot I had in Singapore. The soup base is sweet and light, complements well with the free flow shabu shabu. Optional beer buffet at $35++ per person. Good for afterwork meal or catching up with Friends.

Service is lacking even the restaurant was not fully seated. We went there for beef hotpot, as soon as our food order was made, they began the set up the electric burner to heat up the soup, and start serving us the meat and veggies. But no ladles and bowls were served to us! We requested from one of the female service staff whose accent sounds very local Singaporean. The soup had started to boiled, so we went over to them to request self-service by helping ourselves with what we need to cook the meat, the same staff replied in a sarcastic tone “I only one person!” We explained, we asked in a friendly manner, we understand that the staff was busy, therefore we suggested to them that we would help ourselves with what we need since the bowls were placed just outside the buffet counter. Furthermore what’s wrong with this restaurant not giving us the cooking utensils? for HOTPOT! No ladles, no bowls to contain the soup and the sauce. We asked for sauces to dip ourMeat with since the we ordered Shabu shabu. But the staff with a Vietnamese accent replied there is no sauce since we are not paying for buffet, come on, even they didn’t encouraged us to opt for buffet, considering topped up of meat and other dishes for the hotpot already more than the buffet price (based on two pax), and we are only asking for sauce to enhance the meal! Shabu shabu right?? We still have to debate for it!? Surprisingly, The managers are all Japanese but their attitudes appeared to be “can’t-be-bothered” and lazy. No wonder the staffs are so inefficient, rude, pay no attention to details.Japan is often brought up to be the hallmark of a great service culture.However, the service standard in this restaurant is really not up to Japanese service standard in my opinion

My partner and i first time met up for dinner in here, is a nice ambience, surprisingly both of us love the japanese culture life a lot, share the stories and seen many customer chatted and spend time with friends, they are lively. Both of us love the open concept. Great food, great to know the staff and become friends too.

Purchase Groupon vouchers for buffet dinner. The pork is of good quality and the supplied vegetables are great. Unfortunately, the service level is disappointing. 1. The standard soup comes in a mix of spicy and non spicy. Even if you don't take spicy broth, you cannot do anything as it is included2. Waitresses are more interested in talking among themselves than serving customers3. Poor service level and long waiting time.I think they have another outlet near clark quay. Please go for that because service level is definitely better

I was impressed by the freshness and array of vegetables that was available at the buffet. The mala soup base was surprisingly tasty. The herbal soup base tasted bland in comparison. I caution diners about their stools. The cushion seat is a flap which opens up for diners to keep their bags. Unwittingly while I was adjusting my seat, my finger was caught in between as I put my body weight down. "Ouch" - it was really no fun, so please be careful

We bought a groupon for dinner and it was the best ever Japanese hotpot buffet! Pork was very well- and thinly sliced, and very fresh. Both the meat and vegetables are free flow. The condiments bar has great variety too (yummy sesame sauce and sesame seeds combination), and I liked the barley tea (comes in both hot and iced). The fact that this restaurant is frequented by Japanese patrons speaks for its authenticity! We will be coming again!

Bought a Groupon deal to enjoy the buffet. The deal consists of a side bar of vegetables and dips and unlimited plates of pork slices and beef slabs. I really liked the cucumber with their Japanese sesame dip. I enjoy creating my own dip with choice of Chilli padi, Jap sesame sauce, raw minced garlic, spring onions and sesame seeds. As for the meats, the beef slabs and pork slices come unseasoned. So it's up to you if you want to season before or after. I would say that the beef slices were nice and thick so if you like your beef a little raw in the middle, you can still achieve that with watched grilling. The pork slices are thin so they char very quickly so gotta watch too. The food items are generally quite fresh and presentation is good. The grilling pan is electricity heated so the cooking is quite clean. And the ventilation is non-Existence so you do smell like grilled meat yourself after the meal so please don't even think of going out somewhere glam after please!It's very value-for-money with the Groupon deal and I'll bring my family the next time round.

Limited choice of food and lousy service. We ordered the fried chicken with 2 different staff for 4 times and waited for more than 30min. The staff keep saying it is still frying. What crap is this? Restaurant at that time was less than 10 person. The staff was so rude and dun bother about us at all. Will never visit again

The BBQ buffet was awesome! Free flow of pork, crispy chicken, Japanese curry & rice, vegetables (Carrots, golden mushroom, mushroom, etc..) and Japanese green tea. The pork was very fresh and the deep fried chicken was so good and crispy! They will only fried the chicken upon ordering! Will highly recommend this restaurant to my friends
