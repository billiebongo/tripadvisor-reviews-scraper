Really like the seafood here. South African lobsters were very good and the baramundi were great.
Chendol ice cream was very good too.
4
Nice restaurant serving good food. Of course they pride themselves in this posh prawn noodles but I really like their Wagyu burger with truffle fries as well as their barramundi. Location is also good and service excellent.
4
We enjoyed the set dinner for two - and were very full at the end of it. With generous portions, fresh ingredients and well-executed dishes, it felt like decent value.

Situated in Gillman Barracks which happened to be my base camp many years ago. Great appetisers, chilled Kang kong, fried baby Indian squids with mains of Prawn noodles, Barumandi, burgers etc.
3
Whilst ambience has improved, the quality of their food has dropped significantly. The lobster bisque was bland and their signature lobster roll way too rubbery. The saving grace was the chendol - richly flavored with gula Melaka and coconut.

I like coming to Naked Finn for lunch. There's plenty of natural light if you get the tables by the window and the feeling is great.Lunch menu is straightforward with about 7 mains and some sides.We enjoyed the Hae Mee Tng and Lobster Roll immensely. Don't forget to order the Grilled baby squid as a side dish. The squids have that slightly charred aroma. Really good.i am sold on the owner's philosophy of "unadulterated simplicity"

We ate dinner with friends here. The decor is minimalist but pleasant and we were glad it was less cold aircon than in other places in town. Barramundi and octopus were excellent. Prawns had a nice egg yolk sauce. Super spicy dip in the dips selection. The white wine by the glass sounded bizarre, waitress told us it tasted like wet rock (?!). But it was pleasant enough. Nice evening that can be combined with a visit to the Gillman Barracks art galleries.

Naked Finn has a bar called Nekkid nearby.Good food.Nice ambience.5 of us shared one Set (a) and one Set (b). Was enough food.Liked the kang kong, loved the crispy squid, the bee hoon and the scallop carpaccio.Barramundi Fish was good.Prawn with the sauce was good but not great although the waiter seemed to think they were great
3
Went here with some friends, some of friends like this restaurant but its just not my taste, it's a bit similar concept with seafood menu I tried in Lisbon which has this minimalism of herbs on it. Service was fast and good. Quite ok with the wine selection
4
Food presentation was simple but the food quality was good. Some dishes have no garnish, suit the "Naked" concept. The price was high but worth it. I've tried bee hoon with ebi, clear clam soup, iberico pork, baby squid, tiger prawn, two type of fish, sour plum sorbet and ice chendol.My fav dishes: baby squid, bee hoon and ice chendol.The place was cozy and relax. Nice to spend time there. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly too
4
This place is usually busy and seems known for its fancy prawn noodles. I thought it was ok though pricey. I much prefer the wagyu burger with truffle fries which is excellent. Brought overseas business associates who liked the food very much.
4
Waitress knew what she was taking about, described stuff in detail.
Food was very decent, but not great considering the price was roughly $100/person with 1 cocktail each.
Overall, service is great and menu is good, but could be improved a little.
4
Was invited here for dinner. Nice ambience and friendly service. We tried the set menu, and ordered the iberico pork, Mexican prawn and bee Hoon. Can host for private dinner.
5
Unreal meal here with friends last night.
Great food, great wine and even better service! They explain how every dish is cooked and it all tasted amazing.
Cannot recommend enough!

Naked Finn is a simple , unpretentious restaurant . Food is good , fresh quality ingredients cooked to perfection . It is also reasonable priced. Their speciality is seafood , lobster roll is great .

Even before stepping into the restaurant, I was delighted with the person who took my reservation. She was chirpy and took the initiative to mention some of their specials eg prawn noodles (hae mee tng) are not available at dinner. The place is a simple and pleasant "glass box" with a beautiful plant wall. The staff are young and chirpy, and intimately knowledgeable about their food to offer their specials for the day. We started with the cold beehoon (rice vermicelli) with sakura ebi/prawns and cold kangkong/water spinach with calamanco sauce and fried shallots. Both sounds rather bland but uniquely delicious. The local ASEAN twist is accentuated with the serving of belachan, thai seafood and kecap mani sauces. My daughter had the lobster (from Mozambique mind you) risotto with excellent umami taste whilst I had a pan fried barramundi with a lovely crispy skin. The prices are not cheap but good value for the fresh and exotically-sourced ingredients. And the portions are actually rather large. They do several set dinners but we were worried if we could manage the many courses. The wine list is not a long one but yet they cleverly featured quite a few Muscadet; unique again! I don't know if it was deliberate but all the staff seemed young and vibrant; which adds to the delightful meal. I would go back (with a bigger appetite) and recommend it highly. I saw a large table for about eight, which would be lovely for a group of friends or family
5
I had two wonderful experiences at this restaurant, the food was delicious and cooked with care to showcase the qualities of the seafood. I particularly liked the prawns and the aburi skilfish. The staff were all friendly and made it a delight to dine here. Thank you for the great meals!

Went for there for dinner with my wife. Although I did not make a booking but I was told that we would have a table in 15 mins. One of the waiters took my phone number and she said that they would contact us when the table was ready. After not receiving a call after 30 mins we went there and were told we needed to wait longer. When pressed, we were told that a able would not be ready. I appreciate they are busy but I don't understand why the staff are not honest with people. If they were transparent at the outset we would have come back. But now we won't
4
I had meant to visit this place for ages but never got round to it. I love the simple menu and we opt for the prawn soup with noodles, kicked off be crispy Sir Lankan baby squid. One of our friends had the Iberian pork which also looked yummy. They pride themselves on their fish stock and I can see why. The soup comes with different relishes of varying degrees of spice and this complements the soup nicely. And although I know that whole tiger prawns look lovely they are a pain to peel and your fingers get very messy, plus you are in danger of squirting yourself, Note to proprietor: finger bowls necessary! Only quibble though - wish I had discovered this restaurant earlier as we are leaving Singapore next week

Surprisingly delicious food! My SO has a picky tastebud and he enjoyed our dinner. Food was fresh and done properly. Just the scallops and gula Melaka/salt ice cream abit salty(yes, the ice cream).Nice, happy environment and the staffs were very friendly.. I enjoyed having a conversation with one of them.Good food, drinks and service... Overall, thumbs up
4
Nice place and good food! I am not a big fan of seafood but here they make it very nice and the atmosphere is nice. Worth a visit
5
Love this Restn! Food & cocktails here are always great! You get freshness seafood for a superb good deal. Set Dinner Menu (6 course sharing) for 2 persons start from $138++, definitely worth it! No matter how full we are by the end of the meal, we have to finish off with their famous chendol for dessert. Happy Tummy

I tried an assortment of dishes as recommended by the restaurant owner Ken. We worked out way through an assortment of squid, fish, scallops, pork, risotto. I'm having a hard time deciding which were the best. I think the squid and the pork were really the biggest highlights. The squid because it was so perfectly cooked and so simple. The pork because you could eat the whole thing without anything else. It was so tasty.The fish was fished by Ken himself.The restaurant itself makes for a very pleasant experience. An architecturally interesting feature is the wall between the kitchen and the dining area: it is a wall of plants with a opening in to the kitchen.I had an absolutely lovely evening here

Brought the family there for a birthday dinner. Ambience wise, it was great. Located within the Gillman Barracks, the restaurant had a lovely garden wall but the opposite side of top to floor glass wall faced out to..... a row of patron's parked cars. Not exactly a view worth seeing but just focus on the garden wall and you'll be fine.The lunch menu is totally different from the dinner menu, as we woefully found out, so we didn't get to try their signature prawn mee nor lobster roll. What a pity. If only their signature dishes could be served for both meals, that would have been wonderful.Pros: the "piquant rice vermicelli beehoon" was delicious and so was the mesclun salad. I ordered the wild-caught American lobster which was fantastic, eaten on its own or dipped in the sambal belachan sauce. If you are one for spice, the sambal belachan sauce will be right up your alley. The farmed giant tiger prawns were large and firm and the clam soup was well done.Cons: unlike other restaurants, this restaurant does not serve bread baskets. There is no other form of carbohydrates other than the rice vermicelli, so we had to order 2 servings of the rice vermicelli for our family of 6. The Iberico pork, steamed barramundi, American lobster and tiger prawns come without any accompaniments, so yes, you get 6 slices of Iberico pork on a white plate and nothing else. Tiger prawns on a plate with a small plate for dipping sauce. One lobster on a plate. Nothing more, not even a salad to accompany it. So we had to order the mesclun salad to "complete" the meal. The lobster bisque had a heavy smoked flavour but that was about it, nothing outstanding. The Iberico pork was disappointing, it was dry and tough.Would I go there again? Maybe for lunch to try the signature prawn mee and the lobster roll but the steep prices that we paid for the dinner meal won't warrant a repeat visit for dinner for sure

My wife and I had received a number of reviews of this restaurant from our friends, albeit mainly second- and third-hand accounts. Some had been impressive, others somewhat less so. Taking all of this in, we were keen to give it a go for ourselves and chose to visit for a wedding anniversary lunch.The restaurant was located in an art gallery-rich corner of the island where the buildings used to be part of a British army barracks. The location is quiet and felt a world away from the hustle and bustle of city, but it is a fair trek to get to from the main road. There was adequate parking out front, and toilets were conveniently located just outside the main building. Staff were enthusiastic, engaging, and generally did a good job - thanks! We chose to start with a mesclun salad which was nicely dressed, and for mains we chose their signature prawn noodles (hae mee tng) and lobster roll. The prawn noodles were interesting, not least because the soup was intensely flavoured with the stock from three different species of prawns. It was certainly strong enough that it would still have been suitable if diluted further, and I found it quite addictive. The lobster roll was decent, if a little small. We washed these dishes down with a nice mixed berry iced tea. Overall, a very relaxing place to have a meal, although a little pricey in our books

The ambience is beautiful.....and that's where it ends. I have been to dozens of fine dining places in Singapore from Les Amis to Cut and honestly the value for money here is the poorest I have seen.Let me summarize -- Food: 2/5If you charge fine dining prices, each dish should elicit a wow. Not so here. Only 1 out of the 5 dishes ordered was worth the price. Individual dishes....Iberico Pork -- SGD 30++ -- Bad ...dry and not melt in mouth which Iberico pork should be...if you are not a meat place...dont serve it.Lobster rissotto -- SGD 45++ -- Terrible....chalky with no punch of lobster flavor...2 tiny pieces of lobster each the exact size of my thumbMozambique lobster -- SGD 85++ -- RIP OFF ALERT -- 3 pieces of "lobster" that are the exact same size, look and taste of prawns / scampi. Think tiny langoustine or scampi rather than the lobster look, size and taste you are used to.Grilled Octopus -- SGD 35++ -- very small portion (150gm) - but taste worth it ...Dover sole -- SGD 38++ -- OK...a fresh fish fried in oil...nothing to rememberService:2/5Apparently enthusiastic and with a smile .....but they argue with clients, don't attempt service recovery and throw in the odd mistake. I didn't feel like paying the service charge -- yes it was so bad.They have two lobster dishes on the menu -- American and Mozambique lobster. One can be forgiven to think that both are lobsters but from different sources. What they don't explain is that the Mozambique lobster is more like scampi or langoustine than what is commonly understood to be a lobster. Its the size of sea prawns and tastes the same.They probably anticipated this type of confusion and to be safe they mention the biological name on the menu....do they really expect diners to google the biological names and come prepared like an exam?When I pointed out to the waiter that this is not what I expected.....he actually said "everyone knows that Mozambique lobsters are" !!!!! But the big sin in my book is arguing instead of just acknowledging and moving on. If a client is not happy with a SGD85 dollar dish, at least acknowledge it -- even if you are not gracious enough to try a service recovery. Was he expecting an apology from a paying customer for not knowing a dish that is hardly served anywhere in Singapore?.....Value for money: 1/5Combative service, underwhelming food and portion sizes that are tapas size with main course prices......(you need to have 5-6 dishes paying 30-40 SGD per dish to even feel fed!!)Net Net SGD 283 for 5 dishes and 2 small beers and we left hungry and pissed.Fine dining....No way!!

Chanced upon this restaurant when we were exploring Gillman Barracks. About 70% full on a Thursday night. We selected ala carte as the set seemed too much for small eaters like us. Must try the Indian Squid and Arctic surf clam. Lingcod and chilled beehoon are delicious too. Oh, and don't forget to ask for sambal balachan if you take spicy sauce. Definitely will visit again to try other dishes
4
It's my 2nd visit to the restaurant and both visits (for dinners) were pleasant. The staff were very polite, eager to please and held very enthusiastic attitudes. They were also well versed with the specials for the day. Invites great confidence. Good job! The lighting in the restaurant is a tad too bright and would be good if it could be wound a notch down. Prices are a little on the steep side (we ordered ala carte), although the quality of the items we ordered was good. Overall, a pleasant experience although prices and accessibility to the place may place it in not so favorable stead compared with other similar restaurants. But kudos to the owners for abiding by their beliefs in running the restaurant the way they do :

The Naked Finn is a seafood restaurant in the Gilman Barracks, a former British barracks turned into a first class international art district. It is about half a kilometer from the Labrador MRT stop on the circle (yellow) line. The restaurant has clean, modern, elegant lines, and the food is clean and elegant. They have two prix fixe menus,priced for two people, with great fresh seafood cooked simply. Our menu had wonderful (farmed) barramundi, lovely grilled langoustines (the called it lobster), an excellent Arctic clam. Each dish was perfect, and different. The style was not particularly Asian, but rather eclectic, and very creative. The waiter let us try the house Muscadet first. He said said it wasn't very good. He was right)
5
naked finn has lunch as well as dinner but its good to make reservation in advance - they are packed! the food is excellent - and new ways to do seafood and in general unusual combinations. the ambience is nice too - one of the old colonial black-and-white buildings....
5
I d go back here for lunch any time. Not cheap but a great experience, the morning glory appetizer, the octopus and the lobster sandwich.... Great dishes. The restaurant is a simple restaurant set in an old and restored army barrack. Worth the trip
4
Love the lunch menu. Nice simple fusion dishes and healthy. Some dishes come with interesting chilli condiments. Not suitable for families with young children due to the food selection. The restaurant is located at 39 Malan Road, bigger space.
4
The location is out of-the-way for non-driver, but it is worth the effort if you like relax, green and quite ambience. Set dinner for 4 is S$433 ($368++) with a bottle of Domaine Luneau La Grange and 8 dishes. The vermicelli with sakura ebi is simple and delicious. Pan-fried barramundi is tasty with crispy skin, lovely treatment. Salted egg yolk dip for the grilled tiger prawn is a clever recipe. The set dinner does not include dessert, nor coffee and tea. The chendol and sour plum sorbet were good, but forget about the ice-cream with gunnies stout stuff, it is expensive and taste yucky. Overall a none pretentious place with friendly and warm service
5
This was my 3rd visit. We took the 8-course dinner for four, which at $ 368++ including a bottle of white wine is good value. This is a place that takes pride in their seafood, and it shows, the service is competent and pleasantly informal. Nice simple suroundings with a pleasing 'green wall' and lots of room between the tables. Out favourites were:Wild-caught baby Indian squidPiquant vermicelli - chilledWild-caught giant Pacific sea scallop carpaccio Locally-farmed barramundi fillet from KuÌˆhlbarraHighly recommended, will be back
3
I tried their prawn noodle and grill squid for starter. Both were good.For dessert i had the icecream w guniness stout. I must say this is not worth trying. There is nothing to rave about... For price of $20+ def not worth it. I will say save calorie give this a misse
3
Nice relaxing ambiance, open airy feel of a large dining room in an even larger home.Seafood was fresh, the seafood is the star, cooking was competent. The smell of fresh shellfish on the grill puts a smile on your face, while you wait for ur meal.Skip the lobster bisque, i wasn't impressed. Thankfully the next dishes were better. Monster prawn (wasnt that big) and slipper lobsters were freshDessert wasn't fantastic. Coconut in the chendol was the bright spot. Should rework the dessert menu.Overall, probably worth a visit but not a return
4
I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here, fresh flavours and a nice vibe. A bit off the beaten track but worth it. I had the barramundi with delicious cold vermicelli, though did not like it that the greens were also cold. The littleneck clams were delicious. Had a lovely crisp muscadet to accompany the meal, but would be good to have more wine choices by the glass. All in all a successful lunch, and worth a repeat visit.
5
Went there with friends. Parking was right outside the restaurant and free at lunch time. The restaurant was lovely with high ceilings in a restored British Army barrack. A plant wall by the kitchen makes one feel you are dinning in the gardens. The food was of high quality. My friends allOpted for the prawn noodle soup. Three large tiger prawns, belly pork and they all said the soup was top grade and flavorful. I had the lobster roll. There was a full main lobster claw in mine and very tasty. Crispy French bread roll soaking up all the lobster juice. Must visit soon to try the other items on the menu. Do book for lunch as it fills up quickly. And very efficient and friendly service. Wine list was reasonably priced.

Michelin is absent from the Singapore f&b scene. But ever wondered who would make the list? For me, naked finn would be my first candidate. Why? The food is a function of ken's obsessive attention to detail in sourcing the seafood. He then works with chef to ensure that the cooking never gets in the way of the beautifully delicate nuances of the sea creatures. This is umami of a variety and subtlety that doesn't exist anywhere else in the Singapore food scene. From the grilled baramundi to the scallop ceviche to the intensely flavourful African lobsters, this is seafood served like no other in Singapore. The subtlety in the cooking brings to mind the same qualities that chef Justin Quek used to exhibit when he headed the Les Amis kitchen in the late 90s. Bravo
4
Better to go with friends and take a dinner set than being solo and have to take a la carte. Though I cannot complain: really good service, nice venue with space between tables and a vegetal wall. I had scallop carpaccio (small quantity but really good) and the Barramundi (super good) with rice spaghetti on the side.As the surroundings are quiets I would recommend to go either for romantic and ask a table in corner or group of 3/4 and ask for a set
4
All great tasting dishes. Love the bee Hoon. Looks plain but surprising tasty, can't stop eating it. Like spice? Blachan is spicy good. Dessert must try the gula meleka ice shavings.
4
This restaurant is tucked quietly near the Telok Blangah/ Southern Ridges area. I wouldn't visit this restaurant had I not read about the reviews of its lobster roll from other websites (but they did not serve lobster roll when I visit it). I like the restaurant because of it's cool surrounding, quiet ambience and energetic young crews. They make the effort to continually check out whether the food is alright for my partner and I. They also wouldn't mind to make lengthy explanations on what the food is and how it is prepared, and even make recommendations of what sauce to be accompanied with the dish.I would say this restaurant is very much serving fusion food. It has western, local and even some tinge of Peranakan flavor in it. It is refreshing to try out day to day food in other acts of cooking. Although the food is good, I just don't feel the price is justified. If it is 20% cheaper, it would have earned the fifth star from me.
5
We ordered the dinner set for 2 and was marveled by the simplicity of the dishes cooked that turned out to be so tasty. The condiments blended well with each dish. We thought it was a little too much for 2 but we cleaned up every dishes! What I love most was the Farmed giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon)that was grilled on sea salt, served with salted egg yolk dip and my husband loved the Locally-farmed barramundi (Lates calcarifer) fillet from Kühlbarra that was pan-fried in olive oil, finished with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil. Thought the price is slightly pricey , the meal is worth paying for fresh seafood with a different taste. Make sure to make reservation as it could get crowded on weekends.
4
It's not often in Singapore that a restaurant gets it all right. But this little gem in Gillman Barracks has got it right. While slightly too brightly lit, the location was interesting, the food was phenomenal, and the staff were well informed and helpful. My wife and I tried the tasting menu for two, and were delighted with every course. The scallops, the squid, the clams, and the sea bass were all wonderful with a real balance of flavours and textures. Very well done.
2
I do like the food at Naked Finn. The dishes are done well and the seafood fresh. Surrounded by art galleries, the menu also reflects a sense of creativity. Table service is also good. What I don't understand with our dinner last night was how slow the food was. Granted that the restaurant was full when we arrived and your staff did mention that the lemon sole would take longer to cook, the serving time for the mains just didn't make sense.Two barramundi mains arrived first for a table of five. Another lingcod arrived at least 10mins later and for the two lemon soles to be served after more than 30mins after the lingcod meant the two diners ate while everyone was done. I asked for the service staff to check on the orders three times and I got "the sole is in the pan" explanation. We are fine with the lemon sole taking longer to cook - then it's a case of the kitchen firing up the dish earlier and timing it to an acceptable serving window. More than 30mins gap for the first and last mains to be served isn't. Yes, we appreciated the free order of Piquant vermicelli to help ease frustrations but I really hope it's an isolated incident. I did like my fish and clearly my dining partners all enjoyed theirs when it arrived. I will dine at Naked Finn again and I look forward to raising the ratings. Hopefully.
4
Perfect place for a meal for visitors who are in town and checking out the galleries (or whatever is left of them since their inception) in the Gillman Barracks artist village. And their famed local prawn noodles is a must have! Same goes for the awesome local dessert chendol served in a martini glass.They use fresh and good quality seafood for their dishes which are consistently good. Wait staff are friendly and helpful. It is a cosy place that is also great for gatherings. Reservation is highly recommended though as it is a small place and you do not want to be missing out on all the good stuff after making your way there
3
I think I'm just Singaporean at core, I like my seafood with lots of flavor and sauce. So, even though the seafood was nice and fresh, I think I'd much prefer a hot black pepper or chili sauce with my seafood. I must say that the seafood was indeed very fresh, and I really enjoyed the vongole (they called it short neck clams).The best dish was the chendol. It came with shaved ice, and it was lovely
5
Came here for a team lunch with colleague and it was fantastic! A lot of people sang praises of its lobster roll (and yes, it is a must try too) but I found love in the super fresh and nicely pan fried barramundi fillet paired with the very appetizing chilled vermicelli. Overall, a nice quaint restaurant in the Gillman Barracks - which both locals and visitors to Singapore should go try it

So I read about the $25 bowl of Prawn Mee (soup) and naturally was curious as to see how this would compare with the “OG” Beach Road Prawn Mee – so off we went to The Naked Finn one day for lunch.Now, we had been to The Naked Finn a couple years back when they first came onto the scene, and had an awesome seafood dinner, fresh, simple and elegantly prepared seafood dishes. That was when it was in a smallish, almost “pop-up” restaurant kind of place.Well, they’ve “grown up” and now have a full-on “proper” kind of restaurant – just a stone’s throw from the original site (which is still around but functions more as a bar now) at Gillman Barracks.Walking in, you’re immediately put at ease by the friendly staff, the décor sees a soothing foliage-filled wall on one side, matching the ambience of the serene neighbourhood.Without hesitation, we proceeded to order what we had come for – which was the Prawn Mee and the famed Lobster roll.Now I can really appreciate the detailed explanation the waitress gave us regarding the making of the prawn mee – 3 types of prawns to make up the stock that is simmered for 8 hours, producing a broth so flavourful that no additional salt or condiments are necessary. And I do see how the broth naturally tastes pretty much up there with the rest – but it’s still a good thing they give you some condiments because those with a leaning towards super-rich and heavy flavours, would find this version a little too gentle on their palate. The prawns served with the dish are fresh and huge and I’d say the dish is good, but is it worth going all the way and paying $25? I think I'll stick to the $8 Beach Road Prawn Mee (though it could be that they flavor their stock with too much of a "good" thing, so maybe not so good for me after all, and I'm better off here).Their lobster roll though might be worth the trek and the price – comparatively speaking, it’s rather “reasonable” at $35, and you’ll definitely see nice, big chunks of sweet lobster meat, in a heavily buttered bun, served with a mountain of fries. Ask for extra mayonnaise if you like, and they’ll happily give it to you.We were actually kind of full but fortunately decided to try the Chendol which I was so happy we did, because it really was a winner. Not your typical shaved ice with gula melaka, this one had the frozen coconut water blitzed and made into a fine, powdery snow, drizzled with sweet gula melaka and altogether, fabulous! And at $8, this was definitely worth it.I’d head back again, to try some of the other dishes, and as always, Gillman Barracks makes for a good day out, because you can walk around the nearby art galleries and feed your mind and soul while you’re at it

I just had a great department lunch at Naked Finn! Had the pan fried barramundi with chilled piquant vermicelli and that was a real refreshing take and creation by the Naked Finn people - highly recommending all to order this dish. The grilled octopus was a great starter, and the balachan chilli sauce was spicy and intense - an excellent pairing with the octopus. The lobster roll is absolutely the best I have tasted in Singapore so far - it is the hot type unlike those that I have often encountered at other restaurants which are often cold boring lobster sandwich.This place is not necessarily at the most convenient location but Naked Finn is definitely worth the visit
4
This restaurant remains true to its roots and is a solid performer. Expect very fresh ingredients and good cocktails. A very limited wine list and unfortunately they do not allow / have a corkage policy.
4
Seafood is good; like the cocktails (slightly expensive at about SGD23+++); love the gula melaka ice shaving dessert.
4
I have been to Naked Finn twice for lunch and I had good experience from both of my visits. The first time I was there I had fish and chips and I tried their drinks and then yesterday I just tried their prawn noodles and sorbet dessert. The food is really good since you can really tell that it is made of fresh ingredients. The fish was very tender and the prawn noodles had a rich flavor. Their cocktail drinks and sorbet desserts were unique and they were able to bring out the taste that catches the tongue and make it yearn for more. I hope that they had more options to choose from since their food menu is limited
2
The old Naked Finn was so small it could get away with being odd or quirky.In its new greenhouse-like setting it is not really working.The service may be friendly but it is erratic and clearly most waiters have had no training.One waiter smelt of body odour and cigarettes while stretching across me to pour wine.The mediocre food appeared in a random way and was not much good.Tough pork,unappetising chilled kang kong and boiled uncleaned prawns were not the advertised flambeed in garlic.Added to this were screaming children running amok with parents who had no respect for other diners.We were rushed out at930 and were grateful to leave.None of us said we shall return

First we drive into darkness and arrive in this hidden location. I guess known to most because it is Gillman Barracks. The wall is green plants so refreshing to an otherwise simple restaurant. We had to wait to be seated (i.e. ignored until we helped ourselves) but once we sat down service was good. $70/pax for 7 courses. That is affordable for very good food. I could barely walk out of the restaurant from its delicious repreitore of food. The food is actually a bit asian in flavour no thanks to the 4 sauces provided for all the food - sambal belacan, kechap manis, salt and lime, and a Thai chilli sauce so it had an Asian twist. The first two dishes i.e. the kangkong and the bee hoon was such a simple idea, cold, fresh and delicious. The seafood was also pretty good. Highly recommende
4
It was easy to find when we entered Gillman Barracks. We just followed the numbering signage and located the restaurant within 5mins. Another friend was absolutely lost and we had to drive out in a heavy downpour to fetch her in.On that note, we thought the place is absolutely inaccessible from the main road. Especially when the weather takes a sudden turn, this restaurant is definitely not someplace that you could plan to reach on public transport.With that, you could guess the price is slightly above the average, which we would be able to expect when we see its location and number of seating. If they did not charge slightly higher, these fine menu may just go into infinity in a few months.Nevertheless, staff was friendly and thoughtful when they would at least stand around with umbrellas to shelter us to the restaurant when it was raining.Menu presented mainly seafood. The restaurant was thoughtful enough to offer us a complimentary pumpkin soup. The waitress told us it's complimentary and something to help warm us up. I was utterly impressed....not till I dipped my spoon into the soup and immediately hit the bottom of the bowl. All of us looked up at each other and laughed. The soup was hardly lukewarm, not to mention how it could warm my 100kg body up...One advice to the management, if you cannot afford to offer a complimentary dish in non-miserable portion, nobody will fault you if you do not offer.But when the food arrived, it was a whole new story altogether. I had their one and only pork on the menu and I was totally blown away. Maybe I was stubborn. But I have this (bad) habit of ordering something out of a restaurant's specialty, for if they could perfect even a dish that they did not spend to market, the rest must be oh-so-tasty.The IbÃ©rico pork, they are so succulent and perfectly sliced, they eventually melted on my tongue. It was only 150g, but I had taken the longest time to finish them because I didn't want to end.The various cocktail was a delight too. A friend couldn't drink but requested to tweak one cocktail option into a mocktail and they had that flexibility, which I thought was a very good initiative.Mosquitoes were very bad on the outdoor seating area. I'd advise ladies and gents not to arrive in shorts if they intend to dine alfresco. Although there are mosquitoe coils being laid out, they didn't really help.Restaurant has no attached wash room too, but the nearest washroom is not very far away and it's very clean. Just that....when it rains, ladies will have problem because the entrance to the ladies will flood. Maybe the restaurant management can take a look and find a remedy.In conclusion, I really like this restaurant and certainly return. I am very intrigued by the $25 Local Prawn Mee... :)Restaurant is mostly full, be sure not to walk in but call to reserve first

We will filled with anticipation, driving up the winding road in Gillman Barracks. The setting was quaint, like a garden shed in a quiet corner of Singapore and no frills indeed, as mentioned by other reviews. Service staff were welcoming but may come across as rehearsed, rather than genuinely hospitable. In summary:Fresh seafood? Yes, definitely.Creative dishes? Not really. Taste primarily depended on the 4 Asian dips/sauces, which overpowered the seafood itself, which was a pity. Presentation? Hmmm...Hawker fare on a fancy slate or plate, would perhaps be an apt description.Value for money?No, given that portions were small. The set menu relied on the plain vermicelli and generous serving of (cheap) water spinach to satisfy guest, it seems.Saving Grace? Nice cocktails.Good for a try and will impress tourists, but probably not locals who can get better value elsewhere. Perhaps we had expected more

While the seafood was fresh, it was lacking taste and a pov for most dishes in the set, and felt like everything needed to be accentuated by the 4 sauces provided which were pretty ordinary - sambal belacan, kechap manis, salt and lime, and a Thai chilli sauce. For the price you pay one could get much better seafood options in many parts of Singapore. Overall, not getting what the real hook to this place is. I actually tried it thinking it had a similar concept to London's Burger and Lobste

Hidden away in Gilman barracks, the Naked Finn looks a bit like a greenhouse on arrival. This small stripped back no frills restaurant feels like it belongs by the seaside, and a million miles from the rest of Singapore. We had a wonderful evening indulging in pisco sours and the seafood set, which was all exquisite. Servings were generous and staff were friendly. (I do think though it would not be any more inefficient to introduce table service!) We'll definitely be back

Do try the cocktails at naked Finn, they use sorbet n add in the desired alcohol for the refreshing cocktail to go with the food. We tried the seafood set for two, highlight was the scallop and razor calms topped with the fried shallots. The accompanying sauces had 4 variety, Kicap manis, local sambal, Vietnamese salt n a Thai green chili dip. My favorite was the last two as it brought out the flavor of the seafood without masking the freshness
3
Yes its all well prepared, the barramundi is excellent but the carabinero (prawn) at 30$ is a tad overpriced.
5
No frill, back to basics seafood presentation in rustic milieu. A rare find in commercialised Singapore.
5
If you want fresh, inventive cuisine where the food does the talking then its definitely worth the trouble looking for this place. Hidden away in very stripped back surroundings it was a great lunch place. Fresh seafood dishes all about the flavours it was cheap but definitely a delight

Booked a table for two for two with outside seating but ended up inside at the bar (there is only a few tables inside - and they were all taken) which was equally, if not a better place to be, considering the damp and rainy night.The food menu is limited, so is the wine list - all French white wines bar one Pinot Noir from New Zealand. Ordered a set (comes with two boneless fillets) with locally grown Barramundi, Atlantic Scallops, Tiger Prawns accompanied with a bottle of Muscadet (French region) white followed by one Naked Red Ruby and one Naked Chendol - home made sorbet for those of us not used to these local desserts.The restaurant name is Naked Finn - and although the building itself is not flash - more like a shed - but there is nothing naked or bare about the food - it is all fully dressed - terrific indeed; fresh, superbly prepared and delivered in an elegant yet very simple style and manner - the food is the focus - not the stash! Absolutely worth the trip to the Gillman Barracks - and the bill just shy of S$230 including 7% GST.Truly appreciated this neighbourhood a bit "out of the way" restaurant - lots of ambiance, great food - and the staff is very friendly, accommodating and best of all; they deliver exquisite food.Give it a chance folks - u will not be disappointed

During my recent visit to Singapore I did not have time for food exploration. But on my last day I decided to make a detour from my way to the airport and stop by at the Naked Finn, a place I found recommended in a local guide and that I found intriguing visiting the website (http://www.nakedfinn.com)The place is located at the Gillman Barracks, a small dining space with few tables and a bar.The service is extremely friendly and spontaneous and makes you feeling welcome.The choice of food, focused on seafood, is accurate and well thought, with selected ingredients and simple but accurate execution.I got the "Hae mee tng",  a soup made with a crustacean broth with prawns, pork belly and japanese "somen". I could not resist to get a side dish of grilled baby indian squids. Just delicious.The place offers a rich list of original cocktails that brings a touch of originality to the meal. I ended with a Madagascan vanilla ice cream served with blackberries and enriched by Guinness and "creme de mure". Overall an excellent experience. I liked the attention to the food selection and the originality combined with the informality of the environment.I look forward going back for dinner where the menu is more expanded.A good stop

Located in Gillman Barracks you could be forgiven for thinking Naked Finn is a pop up restaurant. On balmy nights the outside seating is a great choice, but sitting inside at the bar is also a treat. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The cocktails are innovative, perhaps a little sweet. The wine list has some excellent choices, especially if you enjoy drier white wines. The menu - changing daily - is the best selection of sustainable seafood to be had in Singapore. Most items are simply grilled and presented with a great choice of sauces and salts. By no means a "cheap eat" but well worth it as a considered dining option if you do care about sustainable oceans

I had high expectation based on a foodie friend's recommendation. And the quality of seafood didn't disappoint … everything we ordered came impeccably cooked and presented. You can taste the difference of really fresh catch! And we learned a thing and two about some very special species of prawns! For first timers, the tasting menu (aka set menu) is a better place to start (and of better value!) The cocktails are very creative and tasty as well! Its location also makes it a perfect spot for a weekend outing to the Gillman Barracks … think of art + Sat brunch combo! With all good things said about the food, now a few more words on the other non-food stuff: 1) this is really a "no frill" restaurant. I can look beyond the "ice box/storage room" decor, but it also means we have to go order our food at the cashier, fill up our own water glasses and walk outside to use a public restroom. No big deal, but a hassle nevertheless when you just want to enjoy a relaxed dinner, sitting down and carrying a conversation with friends without having to constantly standing up to take care of these chores … it is a restaurant, after all, so make it proper! 2) there are only two seatings per night, so we took the 6pm reservation, and promptly at 8pm, the waiter started dropping hints that we need to leave, soon. Again, it was understandable and expected, but kinda of diminished the whole otherwise pleasant dining experience.Last reminder, if you have party of 5 and more, you will have to come down in advance to pay a deposit when making a reservation. But I have to say, for the quality of the seafood alone, still worth a trip! A unique experience overall

LIKE.The perfect ending to any Gillman Barracks visit (or rather hike) is a dinner at the Naked Finn. Service is great, dishes are great, the place is great. There isn't much I could complain about... Well, maybe the music was a tad 1980s ballad-ish, but I can forgive that considering how rarely I find a gem amidst Singapore's great, big culinary landscape.We ordered the chilled bee hoon which was fantastic. It's large so order it to share. The squid, the prawns, the fish - all the seafoods were grilled, seared and fried to perfection. The wine list wasn't over-whelming but instead offered good, simple, unpretentious choices. Add to the evening some pretty fantastic cocktails (our favourite du soir was the coconut one) and it's about as good a meal as one can find.Oh and the cherry on top: the prices were reasonable.Have you sensed that I really like this place yet

Pros(1) Nice ambience in the middle of nowhere. You don't feel like you are in crowded Singapore.(2) Great cocktails.(3) Seafood was good and tasty. Nice noodles and salad. (4) Service was fine.Cons(1) Really expensive. Bill came up to $300 plus for 2 adults and a child

Didn't know what to expect when I walked into this tiny, clear glass (or was it plastic sheet?) box of a tapas bar/restaurant to meet an old friend. But it turned out to be a very cool experience with crazy fresh seafood tapas (razor clams, scallops, tiny squids, line-caught fish.....) and a very young and cool crowd. The place was probably one of the sheds among this old army barracks compound. Would love to come back for a long lunch one day to take in the green surrounding
5
a very trendy place, looks like asimple kind of pop up restaurant, basic interior. everything is aimed for the excellent quality of seafood. pity they only serve wines that are generally too old for white wines and not very great in quality. But the food is superb! make sure to reserve a table on forehand

Recommended by a Professor of Cardiology, a man thoroughly knowledged in the top dining venues of a city sporting thousands of restaurants, I took his advice to heart… Among the city’s culinary haunts, The Naked Finn ranks 8th.The restaurant’s website yields a curious stock photo reportage and an equally curious lament from the owner apologizing for the hike in fish and seafood prices (which, we all know, and, of course, accept). The restaurant’s address is listed in a former British Army barracks. Surprised? Well, read on. The cab drive to the restaurant from the city is relatively short – and you will have the added advantage of being (for once) out of the city and literally imbibing air as flavored as a favored elixir.If you are new to this cozy establishment, insist – when you reserve - on the best seating in the house, i.e. the counter. This also gives you the ticket to having much more fun conversing with the (I must say) happy and congenial staff, while getting their suggestions for prime menu selections. Consider yourself fortunate since you will be greeted to a treasure trove of unique fish and seafood dishes. If you are in Singapore in December, call these culinary delights, Christmas in July. What more can I say - have fun! Portions are petite, as they should be. You could easily lead your evening’s selection with the superb Kang Kong, followed by a dish of exquisitely tender Indian Squid. Then, you might follow your whim with a zesty Scallop Ceviche, and an incisively delectable Barramundi, which in my experience, was impeccable on all counts. Top it off with a unique, after-dinner cocktail, their Coconut with Bacardi. (Surely, a prosaic soundings febrifuge until you imbibe that first note of coconut – even your smile will be delighted).Consider this restaurant a must on you Singapore list. For those of you still reading, my Trip Advisor recommendation should perhaps end here, but, guess again, I am just getting started. When I sampled the dishes (and the Barramundi, in particular), the underlying flavors and accents were very subtle and somewhat difficult to ascertain. They dealt with some core elements and seasonings, with which I (as a European) was almost unfamiliar. But, throughout my meal, a furtive smile was beginning to build with each petite forkful; I understood what owner Ken Loon and Chef Fong were endeavoring to achieve. Having once stood in whites on the initial side of the Pass myself, I understood implicitly that if all the impeccable dishes I had been served were any indication, then, every dish on the menu had most certainly been the subject of endless scrutiny and debate before being meticulously crafted. This is Ken Loon’s and Chef Fong’s dedicated quest for absolute culinary perfection. Through the energy of the menu, and the subtly of the underlying flavors of the dishes, you know that owner Ken Loon and Chef Fong do not rest on their laurels; their hearts are set on perfecting to perfection. Talent? Of course, they have talent. But then, everyone has talent. What centers anyone on the map is Character, and, closely coupled, a decisive visionary vista.Will Ken Loon and Chef Fong aspire to discover their full potential? Many, many years ago, I had dinner at a rather nondescript, yet entirely well appointed restaurant in Annecy, which was leased by a very young and (then) very unknown French chef from the somewhat netherlands of the Haute-Savoie. (OK, you’re smart, you have already guessed). Without question, I would rate that single meal as one of the top five of all time. It resides on my palate to this day, and its exquisiteness can be recalled and relished instantly. What impressed me was the decisive ingredient, if you will, which catapulted that particular chef to the fast lane of culinary fame: a uniquely exciting culinary vision, which, even then, was almost beyond stellar.  Ken Loon is probing, testing, and reaching. His restaurant, The Naked Finn is anything but run of the mill. He is definitely moving in the very right direction. The keyword underscoring perseverance – that driving human will - in any professional pursuit, especially haute cuisine, is passion. And that, dear readers, Ken Loon and Chef Fong have at the center of a very wonderful culinary kaleidoscope

So that's what it is. Go for drinks and to chill out but not to get a full dinner. The Good:The drinks are good and creative. The food is admittedly very nicely done. Perfectly grilled and fresh. The madagascar vanilla ice cream in guinness is truly a stroke of genius. Get a bit of finger food to go with it and you will be a happy person.The Bad:It bills itself as a no frills place that serves quality seafood for good value. No frills it is, and the seafood is of good quality but the portions are somewhat small and not really what I consider "value". It's frankly a little pricey for the (small) portions they serve. Ordered the full menu for 2 (for the wife and I) and was still a bit hungry until I polished off ALL of the vermicelli. Comments on the individual dishes:Vermicelli- This was surpringly tasty. Fill yourself up with it because the rest of dinner will leave you hungryGrilled squid- Very tasty and grilled to perfection. But really? would it have taken that much more effort to remove the innards?Clams in white wine sauce- Again very yummy- but a bit small as a portion for 2. I spent dinner wondering if they had forgotten the second bowl.  Scallop- Yes. ONE scallop ( per person). Very good very yummy.. but one scallop?? Again spent dinner wondering if they had forgotten to give us the second portion.African "lobster"- This is a prawn. A very large prawn, but still a prawn. Maybe in terms of taxonomy it's correctly a lobster, but my unenlightened brain (that expected a lobster) was not impressed when I was served this. It was again very nicely done, which was its saving grace. Barramundi- I'm not sure about this dish. The skin was very crispy and nicely done- but the flesh felt very slightly mushy. I'm very sensitive to the freshness of fish so maybe I'm being picky ( my wife felt it was just fine) but I'm not ordering this again.All in all a good experience, but I wont be be back for dinner. Possibly for drinks and a plate of that grilled squid

If the Michelin guide ever deigns to review Singapore restaurants, The Naked Finn will be one of those that truly deserves a star. The seafood here is outstanding. It's incredibly fresh and the owner, Ken Loon, and his team, truly understand their seafood. They are diligent and passionate about quality and they know how to eke out the flavour from the seafood without masking it with rich cloying sauces. I noticed the reviewers who gave The Naked Finn an average or low grade seemed to think the food was bland and expensive. Far from it. If you appreciate good fresh quality seafood, you will understand that the pricing is justified. Yes, they adopt a simpler style of cooking (often just grilling or frying their fish in olive oil or unsalted butter) and they give you a selection of sauces to eat your seafood with, but that doesn't mean their seafood is bland. To the contrary, their style of cooking really brings out the very essence of the seafood.My favourite dishes so far are the turbot, the barramundi, the squid, the bamboo clams and the African lobster. I only wish they would bring back their Teochew-style pomfret but alas, because they have difficulty keeping the pomfret fresh for more than two days, it has been taken off the menu.The bee hoon (vermicelli) which is their equivalent of the bread basket is also very addictive. You won't be able to stop at one bowl.Another speciality of The Naked Finn is their cocktails which are original concoctions by the owner and his team. I love all their fruit based cocktails (in particular the Kyoho grape, the lychee and the kalamansi ones) and their newest one using Thai Iced Tea and vodka is like drinking an alcoholic Thai ice tea slushy - absolutely delicious. The reviewer who lamented about their "expensive beer" clearly missed the point when he or she came here.Their dessert list is short but what is a must-try is their creme brûlée. Outstanding. The vanilla ice cream with Guiness stout and creme de mure and fresh blackberries is also delicious.I'm now just waiting for them to start their brunch menu. I'm sure it'll be amazing too

Went to eat at Naked Finn last night, perhaps we had not done our research very thoroughly, it does do what it says on the tin. But we were slightly disappointed by the dishes, lack of sauces, and lack of complimentary side dishes. If you want fish cooked on a plate this is the place, the fish especially the barramundi was excellent. But if you are after nice tasting sauces, moules et frites, new potatoes and an array of salad and veg to go with your meal go elsewhere. It made us chcukle when a McDonalds delivery man turned up with a meal for a kid eating with his parents

If you're looking for seafood plain and simple then Naked Finn is the place for you. The place is pretty much exactly what it says, great seafood, served simply and skillfully at an affordable price. That isn't to say that it is cheap but neither is it exorbitantly expensive as it could be considering the quality of the ingredients. I personally went with a friend and ordered the set for 2 which priced at $158, got us 2 sides and 5 seafood dishes consisting of fish, squid, scallops, clams and langoustines all of which were delicious. It was both ample and delicious to say the least.Anyways Naked Finn gets 4 stars as the cocktails were a slight letdown considering the price. They weren't bad at all but priced at $18 per cocktail on average one expects a bit more in terms of serving and presentation. Also personally for all the delicious seafood I found that the place was slightly one dimensional which although obviously the chefs intention, left me a bit wanting as I tend to be the type that looks for a more complete meal. However, that is a personal preference and if amazing seafood is what youre looking for in a nice casual setting then there is no reason why you shouldn't drop by Naked Finn

I have visited this restaurant twice! The food is super fresh, and prepared to present the real taste of the high class ingredients! The best is to just chose one of the menus hat are proposed and add to them! Make sure though that you taste the American lobster! And the NZ pinot gris is very good!They don't charge any service fee which means that you need to fetch your water yourself and go inside to place and pay your order upfront. But the service is otherwise very accommodating.The restaurant "building" is as naked as the name. It looks like an ice cube with walls of transparent plastic. The floor is pure concrete. I do prefer to sit outside in something that feels like a garden, although it is not.I highly recommend

Not quite cool enough to be worth the money. Tapas style foods - small portions, sea food was fine, well cooked razor clams and scallops. Jamon was pre sliced and had dried out a bit too much. Beer (Estrella Damm inedit ) was absurdly expensive - OK it came from Spain and probably rare in Singapore but it is not great beer. limited other choice - even Tiger beer was too costly. Location is not easy to find as a tourist and you will need to get cabs pre ordered and take the zip code. Clearly this is a local, small restaurant, with an ambitious chef who is not really in the right setting for prices, will have to up his game on food or change location if he wants to be a star. Location and building is ideal for a moderately priced tapas bar full of people keen to have fun around simple well cooked food, not ideal for a foodie wanting something special

Loved the location, away from the busy streetsLoved the structure, minimal, high ceiling, but good lines and the clear PVC allowed you to feel at one with being outsideSmall mozzie prob but inside the aircon portion no so much. They put mozzie coils outside so OKSelf serve order and Water a GREAT Idea so as not to incur the 10% service chargeLove the ala carte menu but a shame the free flow Vermicelli of visit #1 is now $3 a bowl Shame the free carparking is gone too! considering there is not much else in the Gilman complex in the evening (Masons & Timbre for food)Staff are really nice and helpfulRecommend the- Coconut cocktail / Lychee cocktail ($18 is standard for Singapore, there are unique too)- Razor clams- Grilled Squid- Grilled Baramunde- Kangkong........the sauce....amazing flavourThink twice about the scollops though ....$18 for one is just not worth it despite being very nic

Was curious to see what this place was all about. Gilman Barracks is in the midst of a revamp which has sadly seen the removal of all the old stores here and the introduction of paid parking. Naked Finn seems to be a temporary structure (our walls were PVC) facing a running track. We ordered some cocktails, the coconut and rum which was recommended was very good. The "mimosa" of orange juice and fizzy beer, less so. Two of us had baby squid (good), scallop (yes, just the one) and African lobster. We had an order of the vermicelli which is not free flow but $3 a plate. A very small set of accompanying condiments was provided. The noodles were cold, it would have been good if they were warm. The seafood was well grilled but portions excruciatingly small. We ordered more vermicelli to fill up on. You have to order at the bar, and fill your own water glasses. At these prices, the whole set up felt cheapo and the portions were unsatisfying. A far cry from the days when going out for seafood was a "shiok", filling and satisfying event
