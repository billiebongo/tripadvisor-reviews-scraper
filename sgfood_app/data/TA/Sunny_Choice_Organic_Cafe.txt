Vegetarian and organic food. Lots of variety. If you like Thunder tea rice with thick soup (that is, the basil gravy which is great for health and your chlorophyll intake). This place serves it!

It's next to Hillview MRT station and a good place to rest if you're trekking the rail corridor or Bukit Timah Nature ReserveThe place is small so can get crowded really fast during peak hour. Prices are reasonable. I had the dumpling noodle dish which was quite tasty. Portion is good if you're not a big eater

First time stepped into this place not knowing it was serving organic vegetarian food and pleasantly surprised. I've mostly reviewed non vegetarian eateries but made an exception since we were already seated and looking through the menu. We had pineapple rice, assam laksa, bak kut teh mee sua, poh piah and abacus with bo bo cha cha, avocado shake and artichoke tea.The assam laksa was really good although the faux fish was a let down but didn't really affect the majority tastebuds. The abacus was delicious and flavourful surprisingly increasing our appetite. Artichoke tea really nice to wash down the meal but please let it brew longer to allow the flavours to really come out.The not so good part, pineapple rice wasn't tasty and having to put in so much effort to chew the brown rice didn't help. Plus is that the serving is quite large so would only be good as a share.Poh piah was uninteresting and dry. Can't say anything more about it as such.Bak kut teh mee sua was quite interesting, definitely a favourite for those who love dried mushroom flavour. It's intense and dark broth really hits your taste buds screaming mushrooom.Avocado shake wasn't the standard we're used to so it's not really recommended.Neither would we recommend the bo bo cha cha dessert. Not too sure why but it was also quite uneventful where taste buds were concerned. Overall, the assam laksa, bak kut teh mee sua, abacus and the artichoke tea were quite good.Advance apologies to the vegetarians while I attempt to translate the above dishes.Assam laksa in non vegetarian form is a sour and sweet savoury dried prawn paste broth usually served with lots of shallots and chilli with shreds of canned sardine in tomato sauce. Famous dish in penang.Bak kut teh in non vegetarian form is pork ribs served in a herbal broth with a generous amount of whole garlic and pepper.Abacus is a hakka favourite. Yam and starch buttons sautÃ©ed with mushrooms and deep fried tofu cubes. Poh pia, a wrap somewhat like a skinny burrito mostly vegetables such as bean sprouts, julienne turnip though some would stew the turnip with pork and add shrimps to the mix

Love that it is organic! But the sales pitch for expensive cactus juice put me off on my last visit. Nice selection of sundries and toiletries! Operates a shop too with fresh vegetables.The thunder tea is their hot seller, pretty average taste. But I do go back because it's organic and cooked fresh

For healthy eating, this cafe makes an effort to cater to the local palate and yet provide a healthier alternative in terms of flavours. I believe this is borne out in the taste of the food. The presentation is good and there are some vegetarian takes on regional cuisine as well, for example from Korea, Myanmar and from Japan, I commend the vegetarian sushi as being quite well presented. The location at Rail Mall is accessible by train and bus and the surroundings less crowded, giving a better dining experience. The staff are quite friendly and take the trouble explain to you the benefits of the food they serve and sell. There are ingredients you can buy off the shelf and they do take away as well. As usual, organic food is not cheap but it is affordable here
