i come here to eat halal food like hainam rice or laksa. Always in very big portion for me but I can share them with my mom. Be patient here because there are so many costomers in line.

The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor at T2. I had Laksa and the price was reasonable and it was tasty. There are different types of food available including McDonald, subway, Indian, Vietnamese, Thai so it’s convenient for families.

Straits food village in Changi Airport Terminal 2 Stall 5 and drink counter is so rude... is it midnight service all same?

everytime i need to eat while waiting for my flight, i always go to this place. good selection of food from roasted duck to noodles to nasi lemak. when in asia, eat asian food. better than mc donalds or burger king.

The char siu pau (roasted pork bun), minced pork noodles and Nasi Lemak did not taste that good. Maybe we did not order the better dishes so I’m sorry to have to give this place a low rating. On top of that, the lone coffee and toast stall is so sloooowwwww... and the coffee maker got our drinks order wrong even with the order chit under her nose.

This place is THE place to go for local food in Terminal 2.Take the escalator where the Xperience sitting area is. On the second floor this Food Village consists of about 10 food outlets of various cuisines.You first walk by all the individual outlets & look at the pictures/descriptions of the dishes available. When you’ve decided what you want, go to the payment kiosk (in the middle of the “village”) to select what you want and pay (credit card or Singapore cash) for it. You will get a receipt (and change if you paid cash) and the order will be placed directly to the cook.Your order number will be “pinged” on the main notice board as well as at the individual food outlet, when your dish is ready. Sit anywhere you like; your empty dishes will be picked up when you’re done

Food quality: is good considering these are street food. I had curry laksa which i clean the bowl basically.Waiting time: reasonable. Some came early some a bit late but all done (including eating) within half an hour. Facilities: advanced. Placing orders using machines which accept credit cards. It speed up the process.

While waiting for your flight at Changi Terminal 2, don't stay at level 2 departure deck. Rather, go up via escalator to level 3 and experience regional food fare at the Straits Food Village.One of the restaurants inside the "village" is Pho Street, which specializes in Vietnamese cuisine. If you aren't familiar with it, I recommend this easy to eat dish - dry rice vermicelli with grilled beef and spring roll. It is loaded with ingredients - roasted beef, lettuce, carrots, bean sprouts and cucumber, and topped with crispy spring roll. Comes with hot beef soup, which is a good starter. This meal is perfect with Ice coffee. Just right to prepare you for your long flight.

Upstairs in Changi airport a multitude of cooks beaver away behind glass screens cooking food to order.Just like a culinary Argos you key your choice into a machine and receive a receipt with a number. The number is displayed over whichever booth you have chosen and when your number's up you go and collect it.Dining furniture is no-nonsense, you can take your time browsing the different food styles and prices on offer and there is someone on hand to help if you get stuck at the machine.We had chicken with peanuts, dumplings,spring rolls and chicken noodles for a total of 27 SD (about £20)Its a fun and efficient way to eat and almost makes airport time enjoyable - well recommende
