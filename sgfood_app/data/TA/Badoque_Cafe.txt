A great place for steak and more. Come here with an empty stomach. Great portion, good price. 100% Halal.
Bus from Bedok interchange : 2.
Nearest MRT : Tanah Merah (walk about 8-10mins).

Was at the Thomson outlet for an early dinner yesterday as I was craving for some ribs & the ones here are delicious & value for money! Hubby had the fish & chips which was so yummy too! Kids shared the carbonara pasta which they really enjoyed! Portions here are huge though, even the drinks! Also took away their signature spicy chicken wings which burns your tongue but is so worth it!! On top of that, the staff are simply fantastic - friendly, helpful & always serving with a smile! We will definitely be returning to try the other awesome-looking dishes on the menu

We didn't know that they change their menu regularly so you don't always get to eat the same old same old buy authentic selection o cuisine. The duck bakar was just sedap with Authentic sweet spicy dark Chilli sauces over fried rice and egg w koropok and sayur on the side. Beef rib was tender licking good and fish & chip was fried just nicely done. Crispy on the outside tender soft inside. Don't forget a glass of badoque signature drink!

First I'd like to give recognition to the service. Excellent and very attentive. Unfortunately the food is definitely way under par. If it wasn't for the service, I'd rate it lower. Starting with the starters. We had the Fried mozzarella sticks. Crispy on the outside but cold cheese sticks on the inside. How's that possible? Vangole pasta was just a plate of chilli and salt, no other flavours presented over the exceedingly salty pasta. Clams we're fresh though you'd be hard pressed to taste it. What's even worse, fried beef pasta. If we thought the vangole was salty, this exceeded the saltiness level twofold and then more. Unfortunately, again no other flavours came through over the salt. Beef rib was only decent and luck the salt levels were acceptable. However, it wasn't fall off the bone tender. The only remaining dish, lamb shank, was decent enough. Nothing to write home about but a decent meal at a decent value. Milk shakes with half a cup of ice, not the way to do milkshakes. Of course halfway through the meal, with ice mostly melted, it's all diluted down and ends up like diluted sweetened milk. Overall, I wouldn't return as I've mentioned we tried to seek out the flavours over the salt. Nothing really came through. Surprisingly popular place though. Milk shakes are interesting but you have to finish it quick before the ice starts melting.
5
Our iftar went smoothly; from the food to the service no qualms about it. Food and drinks served on time. Food is great and portioning size is generous. Service was impeccably awesome!!! Could not ask for more. Kudos to the team of culinary and servers!!! We love it much and will definitely come back!!

So badoque has been around awhile now, the old crowds have died off and head onto another hype like fat papa's. I still do think badoque has something to offer tho. I dined with my Wife, she was after the risotto and I stuck to the ribs. In my opinion, the risotto was bland, chicken pieces weren't cut up small enough & pieces of skin still left on the chicken cubes. My Wife didn't finish her meal and was quite disappointed. I on the other hand, had a flavourful piece of meat with an appropriate amount of sides. The beef was well textured, full of flavour and presentation was a winner. If I could say one thing, it would be that the bbq sauce was perhaps a bit overpowering at times. All in all, it was a decent visit. I would recommend coming here for the meat dishes, this is pretty much the forte of badoque
5
One of the best restaurant in Singapore i must say. Food at decent price and it is simply delicious. If u don't wanna waste money gaining calories and paying for expensive food, then come here. Worth every penny !!Iga Bakar is the one I had and it is

So my friend really wanted to try this place and we did. We tried making a reservation, but the phone line was super busy.So we rocked up to the place, and the staff there was so nice to let us have a table. And during weekend dinner time as well.Anyway, for me, the major downside of the place was the fact that being a non-native Malay speaker and not fully understanding the full lingo, it was quite hard for me to read the menu. Lucky for me, my friends were fluent in the language of that menu. We ordered some fried dumpling like thing for starter which had cheese in it. It came in a huge plate. Again, because of the name thing on the menu, I cant tell you what it was specifically. It was nice, though there could have been more of a kick to the dish, since the cheese and creaminess made it a little more filling than we wanted. For main, I got the saffron risotto with sliced duck breast. I came on an empty stomach, like a whole day of not eating empty, just to accommodate this meal. But I should have brought five extra.This portion was huge.Now onto the taste test. The duck was magnificently prepared. The risotto, nice and garlicky. Individually, it was marvelous. But together, it just didn't blend well together. I couldn't even finish my drink which might as well have come in a wooden barrel, since, like the dishes, it was huge. Altogether, it was worth every penny I spent. The staff was awesome. Service was quick. Food was fantastic
4
My friend recommended me to try the food. We ordered chicken wings, carbonara, ribs and drinks. Wings not greatCarbonara was goodRibs was averageThe good things, food came in big portion, can share. A bit pricey tho. The place is simple. Huge bathroom. Nice staff
5
B = BIGThe portions are big. Make sure you come with a healthy appetite or get ready to share. Even the drinks come in huge glasses. F = FRIENDLYThe staff is all smiles from start to end. Not brightly lit yet the ambience is vivacious and great for gatherings. G = GIFTEDThe menu is so ingeniuously designed. You must know Singlish or local words to get the humour in their descriptions of the dishes
3
The food was average at best. Star of the show would be their "Chili Padi" Spicy Wings.
Be warned...... Not for the weak of heart or those who can't take spicy food. This spicy wings will burn your socks off.
5
The food was good, the serving was huge, and the price was reasonable. Mainly western food. Try the Kpak Bing Bing if you dare. Spicy! Check out the menu too; hilarious. Kelakar!
4
Those of you who love spicy food, do try the kpak bing bing. superrrr spicy! i ended up drinking 2 giant mugs of lemongrass tea (which was awesome as well) because i can't handle the spicy-ness. syiok to the max! portion was big too, thumbs up
5
The food was quite good. Price is reasonable. I like the location too, brings back some memories. And the menu was unique, with more singlish than any other language. When checked with the staff, they said its for more interaction with the customers, which in fact they have succeeded. Service was good too. It would have been great if they offered wine/beer to have with their meat
3
Have not been here for some time and was looking forward to the same good food during our last few visit, especially the meat. The ribs didn't fail us, but we can't say the same for the fish and pasta dishes. Must of the kitchen's off day
4
First time try out here as we read a couple of good reviews. However we had a difficult time finding a parking lot as it was dinner time and had to drive 2 rounds before finally getting a parking lot nearby. We did not call to reserve so had to settle with the seats outside the restaurant. That is actually not a good option as there was some noisy construction work nearby. Customer service was reasonable. Ordered their "Mak and Cheese", Beef Ribs, the Burning Beberd and the 1.2 kg Cote deBoeuf . Nice. I felt the The Burning Beberd - a whole spring chicken glazed in sweet and spicy soy sauce, with fragrant basmati rice and cucumber salad was not marinated long enough. However overall we enjoyed our family meal. Recommended

Visited Badoque at Simpang Bedok for the second time recently. If you know Simpang Bedok, then you will know that it is probably a little easier if you drive there, despite its relative closeness to nearby MRT stations. The first time I had the "famous" beef ribs, and I thought that dish was over-rated. The taste was not great, and the meat was tough. Left feeling very disappointed.This time, I had the squid ink seafood risotto. Also had the "spicy giler" chicken wings for appetiser. Both dishes are much much much better than the beef ribs, hence I opted to give them a high rating. Taste is good (still not great), with a good blend of flavours.The menu has also been revised. The presentation of the menu is truly God-awful and very confusing, and tries too hard to infuse a Singaporean flavour into a piece of paper. A simpler menu would be preferred
5
This is my 4th visit, we just love their food! The prawn glass noodle salad is a must try, unfortunately they changed their menu and no longer serve this dish. Nevertheless, we had salmon belly chunks (aglio olio), which was huge in portion with generous salmon chunks. A little salty and oily though. The naked salmon was striking both in presentation and taste. Desert as complimentary, drinks were refreshing. Service is always good, staff were attentive to our needs
5
Came here with my colleagues during lunch weekdays at sim pang Bedok. Nice ambience, with many customers. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Have to check with staff with their daily special.. not disappointing at all. Portion is huge for a person. I loved their glasses that served the drinks. It's one of the largest that I had seen. People who are looking for western and fusion food.. this will be the place to try out.
4
Badoque Cafe has always been a great place to hang over and talk over food.The staff is attentive, the ambience is pleasant, and most importantly, the food is delicious with generous portions - we often share one or two dishes between 4 persons, because the servings are just so big!Definitely a go-to space for long dinners and evening conversations with friends and family
5
Our First time here. Ambience here very cozy. Air-con super chill, love it.
Straight forward Decor with Bar and windowed kitchen.
Food portions was MASSIVE.
Strongly recommend if any of u all looking for western cuisines around upper thomson...... Get Over here!!!!! :-)
4
Went for quick dinner. Portions were generous, drinks delicious. Had ordered Shabsouka yummmm and thirst quenching Badoque Mojito sighhh.... a definite place to come back to!!!
5
I have been to both of their outlets
They also have a restaurant in the Thomson area and as always very happy with the food and service
Highly recommended

This particular location of BADOQUE feels like quite the local, friendly, family type. There were a few young children, as well as a Mom holding and rocking her sleeping babe, as she strolled among the tables, chatting with friends. Although a website indicated reservations were a 'YES' item, when I called to inquire, the staff person said folks were served on a walk-in-basis only. The staff was snappy-quick to clear tables, friendly, and knowledgeable re the menu items (or asked a colleague to help, re a cut of meat being served). There are tables inside with comfortable AC as well as outside for a quieter atmosphere: inside the restaurant were the music, lots of friendly chatter, and the frequent hi-torque (noisy) blender. As I was seen taking fotos, the staff made a point of asking me throughout my meal, if all was to my liking (4 or 5 times!). The Greek Salad was brought quite quickly: a decent-sized side-salad, with cubed feta cheese, croutons (imitating the white feta cheese), black and green olives, capers, bermuda onion, greens, cherry tomatoes... isn't that enough?! --tossed very lightly with a tasteless and invisible olive oil dressing. The Lamb Shank was served on a plate swimming w pureed potatoes, with some carrot and peas. The meat was slightly drier than I prefer, yet tasty. The portion-size was 'normal.'  Good, tho not tipping the scale for a return visit. This place is definitely popular with the locals, and has much to offer in variety 
5
Badoque is an established cafe that provides personalise service to customers.The knowledgeable staff efficiently delights customers with the yummy fusion menu.the ribs is a must try.The served portion is generous.Please Make your way to badoque if you're looking for good western(fusion) meal.It's well worth it
5
First time try out here as we saw alots of good review regards of their foods. Customer service super tiptop. Order their pasta Carbonara ala Roma, Shabsouka its was huge portions till we need to take away our leftover and not to forget their kepak bing bing wings, its so juicy and crispy and to my taste bud the wings not to spicy.The staff did told us that they modified the spiciness. The foods super delicious and yummy its worth my journey frm west to upper thomson. Definitely i will come again and would recommend my friends and relatives to try
5
I had a tough time finding the place at first, me not being familiar with the area. Went over to have a casual meet up with friend over dinner, friend was late, waiter takes initiative asked if I wanted a drink first. The drink came, the serving size is way bigger than my expectation, didn't even finished it when I left. I ordered the carbonara, my friend ordered the salmon, waiter was very helpful at recommending their food and gave friendly suggestions because me and my friend leaving for another place for dessert. Friend had late lunch yet his plate was completely empty, shows you the quality of the food. Crowd wasn't very strong on a weekend about half full, perhaps due to high competition around the area, food is very good, serving size is fantastic, very value for money
5
I reviewed Badoque 2 years back and I wanted to review again. Why? Simply because their food is simply amazing. Was at upper thomson twice this week. The ribs got bigger and the mash that came with it was super sedap. The ribs? Never dissapoint. The carbonara was creamy but was not too overwhelming. Shabsouka was of cos good. The viet salad was great too. The kepak bing bing was pedas but marvelous la. I love the Badoque mojito. This place never dissapoint. In fact it gets better every year!
5
A group of 5, we went to try out this halal cafe in Simpang Bedok. We were warned of the supersize portion. So we ordered, one fried steak, one fish n chip, one beef steak and one deep fried blue oysters. The fish n chips came, we were shocked by how generous the portions are. 5 slices of fish fillet when the usual fish n chip only serve 2-3 slices. It's big chunky slices not the thinly sliced one. The beef steak was done exactly what we want, the fried steak is another huge item on the table. We all love the deep fried blue oysters and was still wondering if the owner does make any money out of the huge portion served. The fish n chip cost 24, which is reasonably for the price we paid. The blue oysters cost around 12-14 I think, it's well worth for the portion, see pics. The salad tasting sauce that accompanied with the dish is Yum! Dipping it makes the fried stuff less oily tasting. Sharing are allowed due to the well known big portion. Don't be shy, just share
4
This is not a place for small eaters. Food is good and portions are large so you must share. I was at the branch at Upper Thomson Road with 4 friends so it was perfect for us. Staff are friendly and helpful especially when it came to ordering as it was our first at the establishment
5
If you are looking for a meal to share among your family and friends and at the same time not compromising the quality of the food, you have to come here once. One of the best place to eat here in Singapore
5
We just finished dinner with my family. The food was delectable and the team, amazing! Young vibrant crew full of energy serving amazing cuisine. I refer to the Thomson outlet. Thanks guys. Made our night. My lil girl loves all yous!

Every plate and drink is SUPERSIZED. The ice blended drinks were delicious. However the Beef Vongo was dissappointing- It was a deep fried steak with a sweet batter which would be better suited with a panko breacrumb like a schintzel, in summary it tasted like a sweet dessert deep fried steak jemput jemput. This dish was left untouched and it was clear that it was not enjoyed by our table of four however this was not noticed by the service staff. No member of staff asked as for our feedback or questioned if the dish was not suited to our liking. The spicy glio olio pasta was far too garlicky, it was visible that the amount of chopped garlic on the plate was ALOT. You will get a spoonful in every bite. It spoiled what would have been a faultless seafood aglio olio.The spicy chicken wings are a novelty dish, the sort of dish you would only try once and never again. It was agreed that none of us would crave this dish. Far too spicy that it was an overkill, you cannot taste any other seasoning but the chili. Yeah it was fun to dare each other to eat more but nothing that of a good fried chicken.There was ONLY a mango/berry/choco pudding on the menu for dessert. Overall not impresse
5
Huge portions so share if you're a small eater. My recommendations would certainly be the Shabsouka - flavours in every bite. Generous chunks of meat. Next, Cote de Boeuf - fit for the hungry red meat eaters! One meal feeds at least 3 people. Sharing is a must. Tender marinated meat with just the right amount of gravy and accompaniments! Pass on dessert as there will not be space on any. Will have to come back again for the appetisers and desserts
5
Beware!!! The Chicken Wings are really Fiery and Hot.... But worth trying. Chicken Wings are very tasty and delicious. I have tried 2 dishes over there so I will take one by one,Beef Ribs: A very generous serving enough for 2 - 3 people. Very tender and soft, do not waste time EAT IT HOT. I am sure that you will return for more, if you are a meet lover.Lamb Shank: My favorite and a must have, its tender and the meat slices of easily with only a fork. Its not spicy but still it has its own wonderful taste. They serve it on top of mashed potato and olives. A curry will be provided separately, the curry is made of shank juices, so it is very delicious.The service is wonderful, they do not take any reservation, so expect some waiitng. If you are a meat lover and lives in Singapore, then a visit to this place is a must. I will be going back again and again
5
Whether its the Upper Thomson branch or the branch in Bedok, food served are consistent. Delish!!! I've tried the shabsuka - one of my favourite. All three appetisers - oyster, squid and spicy chicken wings are fantastic. Be warned that the spicy wings are not for the weak. Servings are huge so if you're a small eater, share the main course. Desserts and drinks are very good too. Superb choice anytime
5
Giant ribs & crazy hot wings. What else could a guy ask for. But I will only recommend the ribs if you're there in a group of 4 to share. After that challenge your friends to finish the crazy hot wings (Kepak Bing Bing). This place is great if you're in a group of 4 or more. Definitely will skip if its a dinner date.Also be ready to part with your cash. Although its pricey, I think its justifiable due to the ambience, service & portion of the food
5
Second visit overall but first time at this restaurant and it just keeps getting better and better. The staff was super friendly and the service was one of the quickest we have experienced. We ordered 3 completely different dishes and they all came out minutes from one another. All dishes were delicious! Its becoming a habit to visit this restaurant everytime i am in Singapore. It can be a little pricey but they are extremely generous servings
5
So I had dinner on a Friday which i believed its always packed with customers. When both myself and fiance walked in, we were being welcomed by their staff and immediately they provide us a table for two. As a customer, i believe we always look forward to a happy ambience and staffs. Well now, the food portion was tremendously filling. And its worth the price for two who loves to eat. I shall recommend whoever to come here to enjoy their meal. A great service makes customers feel satisfied. Well done Team Badoque! Will definition come again
5
Tonight, we had a chance to try a restaurant that my mom was raving about from months ago. It is located in a place where a favorite restaurant of ours, Spize, is also located, so whenever we plan to go. We end up going to Spize instead of here.We ordered a cheese bomb which is basically deep fried chili with cheese inside- we didn't really like it except for my dad, a Flounder fish fillet- my sister loves a dory fish fillet, the type of fish they use is flounder which is too fishy for my sister's taste, a good old beef ribs, steak and pasta- my brother ordered this one and its our absolute favorite from all the dishes we had tried, tenderloin steak- the topping they put on the steak was very tasty, it gave a rich flavor to the meat. And for drinks, we ordered ice blended salted caramel- another favorite, although it is actually kind of too sweet for me.All in all, the restaurant is a good value for money and their serving is huge! (Except for that steak and pasta, I would gladly eat all of them on my own.) We actually have lots of leftovers for it was a really huge serving. I would recommend this to a lot of my friends, because it also is Halal.

Nice menu, wonderful tasty dishes. Only setback is not many choices for the kids base on my last visit. Hope they can come up with some menu for family with kids soon. Overall nice friendly boss and staffs !
4
If you love eating beef, Badoque offers the best ribs in the East of Singapore. The portion of the meat is huge. Also, try their lamb shank and other food in their menu. They have friendly staff to serve you and the place is cozy.
5
Very nice food and friendly staff
Came here for dinner with the family and really enjoyed the food and ambience. Service was quick and portions are huge. Loved the ribs!
5
Around 8 - 10 minutes walk from Tanah Merah MRT. Ambience was great. Huge servings of food with quality ingredients. Love the ribs very much!!! Staff were very friendly and attentive. A MUST TO VISIT!!!

Had been wanting to visit this cafe after hearing good reviews from colleagues. Finally had a chance to visit on a weekday afternoon for a late meeting lunch. The interior was pretty dark though the lamp was bright enough to read the menu. Food options were limited and mains vary from $16 to $39. Ordered seafood aglio olio with clams, mussels and prawns which were fresh but a tad too salty for my liking. Noodles were al dente to the last bite. Portion was generous and filling for someone like me with a hearty appetite. No service charge but the staff were very attentive and changed my side plate when it was filled with shells. Expect to pay for plain water
4
First visit to the Bedok cafe suggested by family. Chic little cafe with both air-conditioned and alfresco seating on the quieter side of the area located beside a clinic and other eateries. The inside is warmly decorated while the outdoor was basically tables and chairs with a little lamp. It took a little while before we got seated despite the empty seats around.We had the Big Fat Greek Salad that was generous and aptly big and fat. Taste was the usual but the serving of fetta cheese made its worth. Flounder Fish and Chips was good too. The Badoque Ribs was tender and tasty in its BBQ sauce. While not versed in Shabsouka, it tasted pretty good too.The Ice Salted Caramel was wonderful and probably my best order. The Banana Chocolate was alright and had a nice presentation.Overall food quality, presentation and taste was good with generous servings. Service levels are high and makes for a pleasant dining experience
5
Been there 5 times and each and every time they didnt disappoint. Food is a fusion of local and international fare. Kpak Bing Bing is a must try for chilli lovers. Spice level out of this world!!! Wings marinated in very hot n spicy chili. Perfect! A word of caution, not something for the weak-tongue though! Ribs are aplenty. Portioning is very very good. Some a bit too much though but then its a way to pack the excess and bring home to enjoy later! Drinks are amazing and refreshing. Ambience is fantastic, top hits playing, not too loud or not too soft.What are you waiting for????????
5
Seven of us caught up to break our fast (it is the time of the Muslim month of fasting), and we ordered a main dish each plus two servings of the famed ribs.My word. Seven hungry men, but we were taken aback by how HUGE the servings were. Thankfully we ordered just two ribs, we were struggling to finish our food! The service was prompt, discreet, cheerful, and ever so informative. Double thumbs up. We were also served complimentary drinks, dates, and porridge to sate our hunger while the food arrived at our tables.It was a wonderful, wonderful experience. Thank you, Badoque

We went to Badoque at Upper Thomson Road for dinner in June and truly enjoyed the food and service at the restaurant. Their food portions were large and can be shared by two. The quality of food was very good and the service was also good. The prices too were reasonable. We enjoyed our evening and would recommend anyone looking for good value food in the Upper Thomson area. The restaurant is located at the same stretch as the famous Thomas Crispy Prata House
4
Ive visited both of the franchise at Bedok and Upp Thomson. Kepak bing bing is a must try if you're up for some spicy challenge. The mains were great! the portions were really huge though. the first time i ordered, i almost asked if it's for 2 pax. i couldn't finish my food at all. Tried their pasta and i was contented. But when i tried the same one as Bedok, the pasta was a little dry :( Anyway, i still recommend this place to others if you want to chill with your friends :) The servers were pleasant too
4
When there with my cousins for a mini birthday celebration. I love italian food especially pasta.. Suprisingly amazed with what been recommended and served. I love the Maninara especially the 'kepak bing2!'. The service is friendly and Im sure will come back here again!!
4
Visited Upper Thomson branch, nice modern place with ample seating. Staff was prompt and service was good. Food portion was huge yet so satisfying. Be sure to order their KepakBingBing then cool it down with soup of the year and salted caramel drink!
2
This place is good for those taking public as there is bus stop in front of the restaurant. We have to drive quite a distance to reach the place at Thomson. Foodwise...think they could improvise on their pasta dishes and stop giving lame excuse for putting a lot of olive oil in a dish for aglio olio. I was amazed how their aglio olio is filled with at least 5 teaspoon of oil that filled nearly 2cm height of plate! The rest of the dishes doesn't have much oil but the gravy is nice. Ribs is well done cooked though some parts of it is hard and could not be cut. It was not an amazing experience for me..
3
We (3 of us) visited Thomson branch in December. As this is our 1st time, we ordered the items recommended by the staff which are the "kepak bing bing" as a starter, Badoque Ribs, Not the usual percik, and truffle fries.1. Starter: they warn us that it is spicy. It was spicier than we thought. It was super duper spicy. We are wondering who would enjoy super spicy wings as a starter. If you are not a chilli maniac, please avoid.2. Badoque Ribs: The ribs is huge. Worth the price. But it was over tender, so it was melting in the mouth. I thing my grandmother will love that but not us. The taste was so so. Nothing special. Seems the just pour bbq sauce from the bottle.3. Not the usual percik: This one is very disappointing. The chicken is pale and tasteless. We just tasted it and no one want to eat it. 4. Truffle fries: was ok. like every other truffle fries.5. Drinks: are all ok. Nothing to complain
5
Had a treat with wife at its thomson branch..definitely a must to try..prawn glass noodle was a blast for me..it has a unique taste..had the lamb shank..wifey had a black pepper steak..damn its huge and worth it..we also had chuka (if i got it right) ..my advice..pls try it..photo submitted.

This restaurant has a sibling, Badoque at 298 Bedok Road, Simpang Bedok, Singapore. This is the newer of the two restaurants.There is a good variety of food choices. Everything is prepared with pride and is excellent. The staff are well trained and will watch after you to ensure you are happy.I ordered the "Iga Bakar" Indonesian styled beef ribs glazed in spicy and sweet sauce. The photo I will upload as soon as Tripadvisor approves this listing is 1/2 of the serving of ribs, which weighted 500 grams total (about a pound).I arrived at 6:00 pm on Friday evening and by 6:15 pm the restaurant was filling up. By about 7:00 pm the restaurant was full, but the tables turned over fast enough that people did not have to wait more than 10-15 minutes. For good food, you need to be patient.The restaurant is licensed Halal, which means you won't find alcohol there, so have your beer before you arrive, or after you are done.In addition to an excellent assortment of main courses, which include a few beef dishes (large servings, all), they have a variety of appetizers, salads, and side dishes. They also had fruit smoothies and a drink called salted caramel that I didn't try, but made my mouth water as I watched others enjoy it.Prices are reasonable. The owners and staff clearly are proud of their restaurant

Was at Badoque Cafe on Sun (30/11/14) at the Bedok outlet. Had the beef ribs, salmon marinara and chic mac & cheese. I am not a beef person but oh my, I could have finished the whole plate of ribs by myself! It was so tender and juicy. The bbq sauce over it was not overwhelming. The marinara was great too! Went again on 03/12/14 to celebrate the hubby's bday but this time we wanted to check out the one at Thomson. We had the beef ribs (again! Just because.), salmon marinara (yes again!) and also the shabsouka. Of cos, the ribs were perfectly done. And the shabsouka was great too! So was the marinara.Price is a lil on the high side but hey, the portion is really huge so I wont complain abt the price. Service was great at both outlets, though I feel the older brother at Bedok was way much friendlier than the little brother at Thomson.All in all, I enjoyed it. Food, service, price were ALL SATISFYING
4
A good waiter will recommend or offer suggestions on our selections. That is a sign of good service peeps!! Our waiter was helpful, attentive & offered great suggestions We had prawn & glass noodle salad which was refreshing & v tasty. Chicken wings were spicy & we were warned that it would be hot & it turned out to be fabulously hot. Igar Bakar or beef ribs were huge & shared among the 2 of us. The rice was excellently flavoured & cooked. Would definitely be back to try the others
5
My husband and I are so hooked on the ribs (bbq sauce) and spicy kepak bing bing wings, we have patronised this place twice in the span of 2 weeks! The food is delicious, portioning is mad huge (enough for 2), fast and friendly service and they limit their menu to serving the best (rather than having a lot to choose from but mediocre taste). Badoque Cafe is indeed quality and quantity
3
My girlfriend and I have always wanted to visit Badoque after learning that they are one of the few halal cafes in Singapore. We've read many bad reviews about it, but we thought maybe it was just a bad day for the customer or something so we had to experience it first hand.Went there on a Tuesday evening, outlet was not busy, but we had to make a lot of effort to get the attention of the service staff. We ordered the wings, the ribs and the only steak they have, the sirloin. I was pretty disappointed because I am a huge fan of tenderloin. Well anyway, the wings was served, they were satisfactory. So I was hoping that the other two dishes would be just as good, maybe better. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, big portion, reasonable price for the size. But what is the point of serving huge ribs and steak when firstly, the ribs tasted so-so, didn't taste fresh at all and secondly, the steak was waaayyy undercooked. Yes, it is not easy to cook steak to perfection. We understand that. Even the sauce that was served with the steak tasted like extremely diluted pepper sauce. Tried to get the attention of another server, but was completely ignored so we gave up. Just tried so hard to swallow down the food because it was costly and we are not fans of wasting food. We left knowing that there is no way we would visit this place again. Very disappointed
