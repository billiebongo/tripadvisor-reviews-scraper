They have many different flavours pancakes but I like the crunchy peanut butter the best. Having said that, still prefer the traditional pancakes being sold in food centers.

I love the Viet coffee of Mr Bean, which tastes really originally vietnamese.
Next is their new product - healthy silky-smooth soy porridge! At $3.50-3.80, you can choose from meatball porridge or spicy minced meat porridge. Porridge comes with a stick of you-tiao.

I always look forward to the 3 in 1 bean curd dessert each time I return to Singapore. It is a combination of soya bean drink, soya bean curd and glutinous rice ball filled with either peanut or black sesame seed paste. I usually request for a mix of both types, peanut and sesame seed. Generally I prefer the peanut over the sesame seed filling. A treat for me, never had enough but try to hold back as it is fattening. There are many outlets, you can find MrBean almost every where.

Mr. Bean offers an alternative to the usual fast food burgers, hotdog, fries and soda that is so easy to grab in malls nowadays. Good thing Mr Bean has stalls in major malls too. I sampled their soya milk (try zero sugar) together with 2 types of pancakes. One with egg and ham, forming a mini sandwich, and another with cheese (they use laughing cow for that melty consistency). The result? Great snack !I will be back for sure.

They had soya ice cream and for some reason ice cream (other than prepackaged bars) seems to be next to impossible to find in this city where it is always hot. It was different but good. I liked that you can pick how sweet you want many of their dishes.
