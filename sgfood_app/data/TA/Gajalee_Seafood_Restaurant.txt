The food is really overpriced. The food was very very mild. Infact it all tasted very sweet. The ambience is good

We visited this place two days ago. The place is small and price is reasonable. Crab items were really good. But not many options available. The waiter confused us while recommending prawns, later what we got is highly spicy.

We stumbled across this restaurant whilst looking for a Thai restaurant. I'm glad we did. The chicken (mint marinated) tikka was some of the best tikka I've had anywhere, India included. The mains were also super tasty.

I visited this restaurant on the new year's eve and was really thrilled with the tasty cuisine on offer. TheTangri kebab was one of the best dishes that I have had in recent memory and their mutton biryani was pretty good. I also liked their mutton masala which went pretty well with the naan. Last but not the least, their mango kulfi was one of the creamiest in town and had me yearning for more except that I had to control it for obvious reasons. Definitely a repeat restauran

As someone who comes from a family of fantastic cooks, the thought of paying for inflated Indian restaurant food is always a sticking point with me. I would, however, make an exception for Gajalee Restaurant having had my maiden meal there on Deepavali/Diwali eve.The restaurant itself isn’t super fancy, hiding in a corner that can easily be missed. But the food is a stellar 5star. We had the fish tikka, crab kebab, butter chicken, mutton kheema and peas and fenugreek dhal with the usual rotis (butter naan and chapati) and every dish scored in my estimation. Skip the mint chutney with the fish tikka (its yummeh), the kheema was light and tasty, the kids almost drank the butter chicken and I enjoyed the peas/fenugreek thoroughly. I don’t think I’ve eaten this much Indian food at one go in a long while and the table next to us which had four eligible ladies having a girls’ night out finished their mains HAD dessert and ordered more mains after that!?! If that isn’t a ringing endorsement I don’t know what is. Will return. Soooon

We started with a dish of thin crispy bread topped with tomatoes and onions, followed by chicken kebab, pan fried fish, baked crabs, lamb, butter paneer, green chili crabs, butter chicken, naan bread and creamy spinach. Our party of 8 enjoyed every item although the lamb and green chili crab were too spicy for some of our palates. You can ask them to prepare the dishes with less chili when you order though. The food is very good and service was great.

Went to Gajali with 4 families to celebrate of our friends birthday on a friday evening. What an evening it was !Good company and yummy food - the restaurant caters a good variety of vegetarian choices as well apart from the fantastic sea food. Very good ambience

2 days into our Singapore tour, we were really missing Goan fish curry rice and happened to come across this place by sheer luck! Once discovered we visited Gajalee for 2 of our dinners. We gorged on kingfish curry rice, pomfret methi garlic (chef's special), kingfish rawa fry, chicken sukha & phulkas. Every dish was spot on! Do try the solkadi, felt like being at home away from home! It is a little pricey though..
4
Gajalee serves Indian style seafood, which is not something you come across easily.Service and presentation are very good, and the green curry crab, the butter pomfret, and their masala papadums are a must-have each time I visit.It completely changes my concept of what Indian food is.

This must be my 3rd or 4th review after multiple visits. And the lowest rating so far. How the standards of this restaurant have deteriorated! It really saddens me to write this review but I hope the restaurant management will look into the issues.Over multiple visits, we had noticed that there are always unavailable items from menu, but this time almost everything we asked was not available, notably the fried bombay duck & clams koshimbir, which are 2 items for which we visit the restaurant. Whatever was available - we had grilled prawns, fried king fish, mutton sukka & chicken masala with vade, rice & solkadi - was good, though no longer excellent. The pricing was always on higher side. When the quality was good, it could be justified but now it felt exorbitant. I wouldn't pay a repeat visit at the current level of quality.

Very yummy Fish Tika and Green Curry Crab! Did not expect to find such good Indian food at the Esplanade. Heard later that this is a staple amongst the expat Indian community in Singapore.
Downside: Waiting time and Pricey.
5
If you like sea food, don't miss this restaurant. Food is just excellent.
1. Food: Delicious! Bombil Fry and stuffed Pomfret yummy.
2. Service: Excellent
3. Ambience: Good
4. Price: you can visit once a month. Bit pricey.

The food was served hot albeit we need to wait for the 1st dish to arrive and thereafter all was quick so far you order well in time. The mutton Biryani was very special as made and served in clay pot with dough used to seal the lid. Then the pomfret fillet slices was just too delicious and perfect platter for a family of 4. I tied the bar with the Macallan on rocks and some Kingfisher premium beer which was perfect to build the foundation for a lovely sumptuous meal. The last but not the least was the mutton keen served piping hot with garlic nan and just melted down the throat. The quantity was perfect for 4 and the price jast below the expectations of fine dining with a family of 4. They had some lovely deserts of Kulfi but our stomachs were ful so skipped that for next time. The staff was polite and prompt. The restaurant was full packed and busy. No prior booking seemed necessary for a family of 4 on a busy Saturday
5
We ordered plates to share and left with full bellies from the delicious food.The restaurant wasn't busy, which was good for us, so I think it's the kind of place you go to when you know about it.I'll definitely come again to dine - there are lots of healthy options with the tikka and tandoori selection!

The Good:1. Super succulent, tender kebabs with the just the right amount of spice. Loved the Pomfret and Reshmi Kebabs. Probably the best kebabs in town!2. Loved the Biryani here, especially the Mutton biryani.3. Quiet, cozy ambiance.4. Excellent and friendly service.5. Good Palak Paneer. Kulfi is its unique dessert, and not too bad.The Not-so-good:1. They don't have much of a Vegetarian menu, probably just about 5 dishes in all, out of which one is Daal and 2 are Paneer based dishes. Even though the Palak Paneer was nice, don't look here for your daily quota of veggies!2. Their serving style is a bit odd. Basically, one of their staff serves out onto your plate equal portions of the food you ordered, and then leaves the serving bowl in the center of the table only if any food is left in there. I find this odd because it doesn't give us the freedom to taste the dishes and have more or less of what we want as per our preferences. 3. The point no. 2 is also the main reason I wasn't able to take any pictures of the food because it was never made available in the serving bowl !4. The Raita that comes with the biryani has terribly tiny portions, and somehow they didn't serve it to us with the biryani. I waited a while, and had to remind the server to give us the raita which was sitting on his serving tray behind us on the counter. Funny!5. The napkins are of a cheap, synthetic material and do little to wipe your hands clean.6. We wanted the leftovers packed to take back with us, and I was disappointed to see that a restaurant of their standing packed the food in those cheap, plastic, tie-up bags you get in hawker centers, instead of using the standard, microwaveable plastic containers, even when our food quantity was sufficient to have fit in those containers. 7. I also found it rather strange that for our desserts of Gulab Jamun and Kulfi, they gave us soup spoons to eat with, rather than dessert spoons! I think the management should look at these finer points of serving and service to make their restaurant experience even more enjoyable

Despite the number of Indian restaurants and street stalls in Singapore, finding one with a good dum briyani and a nice range of other dishes was a nice surprise.We were there for a quick pre-concert dinner, we ordered the mutton dum briyani, a spinach dish, their house special fried ocra and jumbo prawn tandoori starter. Spicing on all the dishes was clear and distinct - non of the one masala for all syndrome, The briyani and ocra were the stand-outs, but the others were fine too.The other Indian restaurant at the Esplanade (Mirchi) is no longer operating, so Gajalee is a welcome alternative to the Western, Chinese and Japanese options there. In fact if you're looking for mid-high end Indian restaurant, even if you're not attending theatre or a concert, this is worth a punt
5
We were taken here by a work colleague, who knew the place. Goan cuisine, as I learned is seafood-based with Portuguese influences. We had many different kinds of fish and crab with red and green sauces, all flavorful and all distinct. A New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc turned out to be the perfect accompaniment
5
For a unique Indian food experience do visit Gajalee. It has a distinctive flavour with north Indian spiced. There are a broad range of dishes, including traditional favorites like butter chicken- which I must say is one of the best I've eaten, but the star is certainly the seafood dishes. The butter and pepper crab was a real winner. It was a mild dish, with not much heat but the distinctive spices were there that enhanced the taste of the flesh! Great crab! Next time I'll try some of the spicier ones to compare. The fish kebab was actually a fleshy piece of fish BBQed on a skewer. There was just enough smokiness that complemented the spices that the fish had been marinated in. The flesh was still moist and perfectly balanced indication great precision cooking. All other dishes were equally good... Except maybe for the prawn biryani which was a bit of a let-down... This place does not have a wide selection of desserts though the kulfi seems particularly popular! I'll definitely come here again, as the service was also attentive. The decor is good but not great, though the food and service more than make up for it

Our first time at this friendly and clean restaurant. It opens at about 6pm. The menu was varied and quite different to other Indian restaurants in Singapore. The seafood theme is pervasive but there are meat and vegetarian options for those with such a need. We tried the:Seabass koshimbir Dhal bindiPaneer kadai Plain riceNaan garlicJumbo prawns ambat tikhat The dhal bindi (crispy and very tasty) was the best surprise but all the food was excellent. There is a decent enough wine list that included a perhaps surprisingly good Indian white wine. Service was very friendly and suitably attentive. We placed our order at 6.10 and the food arrived fresh and well presented at 6.35pm. One suggestion for many of the restaurants in the Esplanade Theatres on the Bay is to develop pre-theatre set menu option and to open at a time that fits the show times.

Our son and daughter-in-law took me and my wife there with my 2 grandchildren.The reason they selected this place was because of the following:1. Spicy food2. Congenial atmosphere3. Excellent and personalized serviceThey were 100% right on all counts and we had a lovely time as a famil
4
If you are looking for Indian food around Esplanade, the lunch set meal here is awesome. Portion is pretty big but it's very tasty.
4
Had lunch at this highly recommended Indian restaurant. The food was tasty, the waiters attentive and basically a very nice all round dining experience.
4
This is definitely one of the best Indian Seafood Restaurant . However, their pricing is very steep . This is where you have budget at S$100 per head
5
Great Indian food and most importantly , exceptional service.We tried stuffed tangdi kebab for starters and loved every bit of the unique preparation.Mains included surmi fish and palak khichdi - fresh flavors !All in all, a must go for Indian seafood lovers in Singapore.We will be back for sure
5
We were there to celebrate our 31st night. Restaurant closes at 11 pm but continued serving to the customers inside.We had to call in early and reserve the seats for 7 people.Food was delicious, though we wanted to order more Maharashtrian dishes.They were dishing out only some set dishes owing to new year and lot of customers asking staple food items like biryani, daal, basmati rice etc.We liked the sol kadi and saguti curry.Excellent restaurant we tried after a long time in Singapore

I always thought that Gajalee is seafood only restaurant with not so good vegetarian dishes. I had never visited this place till my friend invited my family for dinner. Being a strict vegetarian by choice I was apprehensive. Everything apprehension was put to rest as soon as paneer tikka was served. It was mouth watering. Next we corn methi kebab and it was out of the world. We ended up ordering 4 plates. The main course was equally delicious. Dahi bhindi was mind blowing and subzi Hariyali different then any other I had, and out of the world. Overall satisfying vegetarian taste buds in a seafood restaurant was unexpected and a happy tummy moment. By the way I had confirmed with restaurant manager that meat/seafood cookware, ingredients are totally different then vegetarian.

Is every restaurant in Singapore in a hotel or shopping mall? Guess so. This one's on the ordinary side. Lentils were nicely spiced. The "signature" crab soup was on the bland side. If you're at the Esplanade and hankering for Indian food, this place is serviceable. The Esplanade's night-time outdoor food court is far livelier and more interesting

I have been visiting Gajalee since 2013. In my humble opinion, Gajalee serves the best crab in Singapore, and its definitely better than Chilli crab. We felt that the Green chilli crab was the best until we tried the Butter ginger crab after which we were totally blown away by the taste. They can vary the taste from mild to very spicy as per your need. Other fantastic dishes on the menu are teesrya koshimbir (claims in grated coconut masala), bombil fry (bombay duck fish) and fish kebab. No matter what food you order, you will not be disappointed. The service is top notch every single time. I have been seeing the same wait staff since my first visit nearly 3 years ago which is very rare for Singapore restaurants. They are super polite but will also offer you an honest opinion if you need one. Being Indian, I can confidently say that this is the best Indian restaurant I have been to in Singapore.

Food was pathetic, when notified about that was said that they serve such food since 7 years.Waited for over an hour for our foodStarters: pomfret fry - fish not fresh was just fried in semolina-no salt-no chilli- was blandSquid masala-like rubber-masala was only grated coconuts-was like Squid dropped in red dosa chutnyMain course-chapati and fish curry-fish curry surmai was stale with rubbery edges - masala of the curry was not freshManager approached us and was told that they are serving such food since 7 years and they are less on manpower-not apologetic but defensive. . Says Mumbai has varieties and here they have limited choice. So what you get in mumbai may not be the same preparation here...38$ for a stale pomfret fry?Can't even think of comparing with Mumbai !Go only if you never tasted an Indian food... you will never come to know the difference and will never regret as we did

I visted Gajalee Seafood Restaurant with a five colleagues on 23 Oct.. The food are most tasty and matched only be their staff caring servives and honesty. I overpaid the bill by more than S$300 and Mr Xavier the Manager phoned me on my mobile to apologize for the mistakes. He cancelled the credit card charges and ask me to go back to pay the correct big when I am free. I must point out that the mistakes were due to softwares glitch

This is the best Indian food I have taken in Singapore. Even it is a little pricy, I felt that it is worth it.
Best dishes - crab meat curry. Promfet tandoori
Highly recommended.

To be fair the food is good and unlike any other indian restaurant here in singapore. The service is slow (was given a used serviette with a lipstick mark!!). The prices are on the higher side but the menu does have lots of choices .
4
Had business lunch in this restaurant, decor is nice, service is really good and food is deliciousFood is cooked with right amount of spices and cooked pretty well, also good place for those who can't have spicy food.Must try place in Singapore, try Dahi Bhindi, Chicken tikka masala, Kababs and fried Pomfret.Mango lassi and biryani are the other specialities which I loved at this place

I was a frequent customer to Gajalee Vile Parle when I lived in Mumbai. Gajalee is quite a popular restaurant in Mumbai and known for it seafood. I was quite excited when they opened up a branch in Singapore as I missed the Konkani style of seafood. Have visited this Singapore branch a couple of times now and taste of food is pretty consistent with their original restaurants. The only thing is that it's much pricier with the standard Thali options only served at lunch time. Also one of their signature dish bombil fry (bombay duck fish) is mostly unavailable here in Singapore. If you are new to this restaurant then I would recommend trying Surmai fry, Surmai curry, pomfret tikka, pomfret with green chatni, prawns curry, lamb curry and biryani. If your around at lunch then you can order the fish thali.
5
This was a return visit. I had heard a lot about this before my first visit, which for a lunch that I found underwhelming. Friends convinced me to give it another shot, at dinner time when you skip the set lunches and can go for a la carte dishes. The food turned out to be great! We decided to go for their specialty fish and seafood dishes, including the outstanding Bombay Duck fry (really a lizardfish) as well as a Prawn Kolivada, which is not on the menu - but which they are happy to prepare for you. Topped it up with an outstanding Prawn Biryani - quite possibly the best biryani I have had in Singapore, with a linger aftertaste of saffron. Outstanding

One of the best Indian meals I have had in a long time. Extremely light and tasty. Delicious.. Every dish a joy and ordered upon excellent advice from the waiter.We were there for dinner before going to the theatre in the outstanding Esplanade theatres by the Bay, Will definitely visit again soon regardless of going to a concert or the theatre. Excellent

Came with 2 families on Chinese New Year & first time trying this restaurant out as all other restaurants in Colour by the Bay were packed to capacity with long queues still in sight at 6pm but Gajalee had no queue. Was greeted & ushered by Xavier to our table. Tried all 3 different Lassi ie Kiwi, Blueberry, Mango & Mango stood out outstanding, the rest quite mild in flavour. The beriani rice was excellent as it was not so oily but fragrant with perfect texture & color. The fried sambal sotong or squid was a slight disappointment as it was more salty than required. The mutton curry was good, meat was tender but the curry was not a WOW for the hefty price paid. Could be much improved if the spices could boost up the taste & smell. The spinach with cheese was excellent, perfectly done. The butter chicken could be better if chicken thigh was used instead of chicken breast. The fish kebab was the climax for the dinner as it has the charred aroma whilst the meat was cooked to precise timing, as it was juicy yet giving the correct bite to the texture. Xavier was helpful & patient but perhaps customer rapport building (a pep chat) may exude a more warmer & personal touch for diners to return again & remember the service rendered. Ambience is ordinary & cosy, nothing conspicuous. I like the 3 framed up paintings of Indian cultural costumes on the wall. All in all, i reckon the price is on the high end as overall food was not a big WOW throughout except for few dishes & service was not impeccable & prompt, as on several occasions we had to hunt 'high & low' for the waiters. When we left the premise, we didnt feel the warmth from the staff as wanting us to come back for more but a cold departure. If this aspect was improved upon & taken heed, i believe Gajalee will definitely reap with bustling & growing business for expansion.

We were looking for a restaurant to done last week and my lunch partner suggested a few places to dine. I picked this restaurant, as it was in town and easy for me to get to my next appointment.The restaurant is located just outside the Esplanade, at Colors by The BayGajalee means "an informal gathering" in Malvani & Konkani dialect is a Singapore outpost of a chain of seven restaurants, with the remaining six based in Mumbai & Mangalore, India.The restaurant is popular for seafood, but as this was lunch time, we had to be practical and choose something easy to eat to avoid accidental staining of our business attire if we were to eat seafood.We chanced upon set lunch options, and we ordered the Mutton Set, which had a mutton chop on bone, Briyani Rice, Mutton Curry, Dahl soup, Onion salad and Plain Naan. It costs $18. The verdict:- Mutton chop on bone, Mutton Curry, Dahl soup, onion salad and Plain Naan.- Briyani Rice: I find the briyani rice a little moist. It was set in a mould. Breaking into the mould, you will find a hard boiled egg, which is cooked in the rice. A pleasant surprise.- Mutton Curry: This was very tasty and went well with the biryani rice and naan. Nice!- Dahl Soup: The soup is a small portion, with carrots and sliced French beans. Stir the soup around, which has mashed dahl below to get a better flavour.- Onion Salad: This is like achar (pickled vegetables). But the onions were a little strong and both my lunch partner and I had half of this left behind at the end of the meal.- Plain Naan: Naan was round and cut into 4 quarters. I felt the size was a little small and it was more like prata-sized. Eaten together with the mutton curry, it was nice.I added a Spinach Soup, a creamy spinach soup cooked in vegetable broth. It costs $8. I found the soup a tad salty, and a little watery.We ended our meal with masala tea ($6). I wished the serving could be more, as the tea cup was barely sufficient for me to enjoy my fill. The restaurant could use a bigger cup or offer a tea pot.I learnt from the manager that the 3 chefs in the kitchen hails from the restaurant chain in India and have many years of experience. This means that the food served here is of the same quality and taste as those served in the restaurants back in India.I will come back again with a larger group to try their ala carte menu items and definitely their seafood items
5
The restaurant is one of quite a few options at Esplanade but definitely a surprisingly good one. The food is fresh and delicious. Not heavy, or oily and good portion size. There are meat options too (its not just seafood) and there are dishes you will know as well as some very nice different options also. The staff and service are excellent
4
Great food overall - Will recommend the place if you're a fan of seafood! Must try their crab dishes, they have 2-3 crab dishes where the shells have been taken out and it's only the meat (saves one all the hardwork before eating)Service is a bit slow but the staff is quite helpful and genuinely friendly. Might be a bit pricey - works out to approximately $50-60 per hea
