Delicious coffee and food for brunch or lunch. Small space suitable for singles or couples but not for groups. Opens too late for breakfast though.

Stopped by to this place after dinner for some dessert. The Gula Melaka cake is too sweet but the carrot cake is really nice.
Good service and nice place to hang out.

A bit skeptical about the bottled coffee, and it turned out the taste was really amazing.Ordered Thai Milk Tea, and that was the best Thai Milk Tea ever.Place is packed, so we had no time for dine in. Really recommend Bottled Cold-Brew Coffee variant.Not too much expensive

Didn't eat there but the coffee was sensational, strong, smooth and as good as any in Melbourne. One of the best coffees I have had in Asia. Cool little place.Only downside is not open until lunch time or 10am...would be perfect for an early morning coffee

I went to the one at Owen road. You can take train to Farrer Park station and easily can find the cafe.The food and filter coffee was not that bad but there are better cafes with a better price elsewhere in Singapore. Overall the experience was great with free wifi. Recommend to those who never visit this cafe befor

You got to see it for yourself, especially the Christmas decor. Nice lighting and friendly staff, with a wide selection of food items that seem to agree well with other patrons. My friends who were coffee lovers enjoyed he frozen coffee cubes with milk on the side thing. Pretty well done according to them.

If you want good strong coffee, this is the place to be at. Whether you need a sit down fresh brew or ready grab-and-go bottle in the fridge they have them. As I stay in the vicinity new cafes keep popping up and this is always crowded so I gave it a miss till now. A little expensive for a cuppa but good coffee justify the price. Not so for the ondeh ondeh cake. It tasted a little sour like it was not fresh but the flavor was there. Don't think its baked in-house but supplied by a third party. The Muesli bowl was a simple fast pick me up meal. Overall a good atmosphere and good location. Hope to see new and better food offerings to accompany the solid coffee

My partner and I were a little bored of Jewel, our usual haunt and decided to give this local cafe a try, since reviews of Google seemed overwhemingly positive.The cafe was tiny, with communal tables and some very uncomfortable canteen-style stools. The interior of the cafe was clean and bright, except for some dried flowers near the ceiling. Who decorates with dried flowers? They are like a dust magnet! They should be a no-no for a place that serves food!We ordered from a very tiny food menu - a crab coleslaw burger and a chicken cheese burrito. The food was AWFUL. The crab coleslaw burger was a awful tower of coleslaw with some fishy bits and CORNFLAKES (!!!) wedged between a toasted bun, served with a side of vegetable crisps (the type from a packet). Maybe I did not read the menu properly when I ordered but I was almost expecting a crab patty or croquette topped with some cole slaw in a bun... just not a giant mass of horrible cole slaw. The burrito was no better. It came dripping wet with chicken/cheese juices. It came with a pretentious side salad of spinach leaves, strawberries, and blueberries. The cheese was cheap processed cheese that was probably pre-grated. The wrap was not fresh. It was just a disaster. The salad with the berries was not a good idea at all, especially not when the berries were swimming in a puddle of chicken juices.We ordered two lattes with our food. The latte was fine, nothing spectacular. It was served in a very very tiny cup. However, since it was cheaper than Jewel's, we decided to give the cafe 2 stars.Old Hen should just concentrate on their coffee and go back to the basics - good, freshly prepared, unpretentious food

Nice cosy cafe tuck away in a little corner of rangoon road. Easily accesible by car or mrt (farrer park mrt) . The only items we tried were the creamy white Cold Brew Coffee and Thai Ice Milk Tea. Super thumbs up for the cold brew... if you dunno what to drink, jus go for their cold brew. The limited seats give it a real cosy feel. They even have a toilet. =

This place has wonderful cold brew coffee and cocoa. I had a super healthy and good feeling lunch. The chicken cheese burrito had a nice chew to it with the rightly melted cheese. The smoked salmon & apple on toast is light and refreshing. The salads accompanying both are just simply delish. My first visit and definitely not my last.
