There’s a limited sandwich menu for lunch but it’s good. The cakes are beautiful and altho expensive, reflects the quality. I like the tarts. Coffee is good too.

Went for a quick desert and coffee after a late lunch. The shop offers a reasonable selection of deserts along with great coffee. Service was fast and efficient. Worth a stop if you are in the area.

Went there with my son, he loved the cafe and ice chocolate while I enjoyed my latte... nice cafe in Telok Ayer shophouse....

been to this cafe twice - once for cakes n once for coffee, both are good but not excellent. definitely overpriced, i would say, then again this is in an area where people are willing to spend, and i'm not an expert on cakes. my only complaint is that these cakes are tiny, but i get the idea. these are not to fill you up but to give you the taste - and the texture is definitely great. pretty cafe on the whole.

The cakes here are delicate, elegant and delicious.Not surprising when I found out the main bakery chef is Japanese. Pantler is by a Singaporean and a Japanese bakery chef who met in Joel Robuchon Singapore and Grand Hyatt Tokyo.Its famous choux creme or cream puff has delicious filling. I agree with #rubbisheatrubbishgrow a local food blog that the pastry can be better, but their fillings save the day.I loved the citron blanc and enjoyed the choux creme.Deserve repeat visits.

They've got a tea time set which makes having coffee and cake sightly cheaper, but otherwise expect to spend an average of $8 on a slice of cake. Though putting into perspective, that is around the price to pay for artisanal cakes in singapore.Cheaper and still good choices are their cream puffs, and the cream roll cake. There's also water that you can collect yourself if you don't want to pay for drinks. But a friend swears by their coffee. If you're a chocolate lover, definitely order the Yatsura cake. For celebrations, the cream roll cake is definitely a great choice. Usually requires a day's advance notice but if you need one urgently, doesn't hurt to ask whether they happen to have extras. The pound cakes look pretty but I found them to be too dry for my liking

This cafe is quite small, like most eateries in this area. It has a good variety of cakes and pastries. Good for takeaways. To dine in, it can be difficult to get a seat esp during lunchtime. The seats are not very comfortable. More like a place to eat and go. Service is not very consistent but the pretty cakes make up for it

this is one of my fav pastry shops in Singapore. Pity the service; it's more often than not a miss....you either get brusque service or staff (and/or proprietors) need to really think through service levels, specifically in the way service should be rendered - somehow I get the impression Pantler's service standards are the result of 'a means to an end' approach; not quite on service as an end in itself

The first thing one notices about the cake slices here is that they are smaller than usual, which is good news for the waist- and weight-conscious. But even small portions can leave one feeling really satisfied, because they are rich in flavour and truly delicious! A plus point: Though the shophouse unit is small and there wasn't a table that could accommodate my party of 6, the staff very helpfully moved the necessary furniture and created a table for us in the waiting area. Great service

The office is freezing, it's raining outside and it's lunch time.Oh forget about the lunch, you just need a good dessert.Where do you go? Pantler!The mood for today calls for a Yatsura -- a totally chocolate praline cake.Crisp crunchy bottom layer, nutty creamy chocolate mouse with a top layer of smooooth velvety dark chocolate. Savor every bite and feel the texture against your teeth and tongue, and finally the amalgamation of chocolate and nuts against the palate.A small piece of cake but big on taste.I was opining that the slice of cake is a wee bit small, but after finishing, I find it a good size actually, satisfying enough to not be a burden trying to finish it until it become a burden and lose its initial loveliness

I love this place. I love the service, I love their coffee (especially Peppermint Mocha), their cakes (I better not start). The owner is a very friendly guy and makes one feel welcomed. I asked about certain ingredients in the bakes and cakes and he was forthcoming. Pantler is a place I don't mind putting on a few calories for dessert. And it is one of the few places I think of when I am craving some good quality chocolate cakes for tea time.

Coming from Sydney where the rage is for a particular cake shop, I can say this place is amazing. The cakes have got the right balance of sweetness n texture and most importantly you can taste the ingredients. We tried the Banana run tart and the Rhubard apple tart. Excellent cakes.

We ordered two cakes from the bakery run by a Japanese Chef. One is a NYC Cheese Cake and the other is Dark Chocolate. Both are excellent, particularly the latter. Not too sweet but rich in flavour and texture. The price is a bit on the high side ($45+) for 4-6 persons but the size is just nice for family birthday occasions

Their cake and desserts are simply delicious and makes me yearn for more.Cream Brulee and Cream Cake Roll and Yatsura, Black Forest are my favourite.Not a cheap place to have desserts but once awhile if you feel like splurging on comfort food, this is the place to visit.And you will want more thereafter :

Upon entering this small but cosy cafe, i was immediately drawn to the pretty-licious french-inspired japanese cakes on the shelf. So many varieties and all so tempting:) ordered a yatsura and millie feuille plus 1 mocha, all tasted heavenly. Bill was abt $25, slightly higher than usual cafes. Parking was not easy on a sat afternoon but the cakes will beckon me to return.

Do not miss to visit Pantler and the cakes are so so so yummy. The chef is a Japanese with French style. He is really good at it. Coffee is ok, place is good and price is reasonable. Go to Pantler and have a tour in Telok Ayer - very nice place

The cakes and pastries here are exquisite. Some cakes are more expensive than what you would get elsewhere but you can see why when you bite into them- the different layers and textures exploding in your mouth and the quality of ingredients. Surprisingly, the pastries are priced about the same as other bakeries and offer good value. Staff is polite and the bakery, painted in grey with Scandinavian looking lighting, is simple but sophisticated. Would love to come back again.
