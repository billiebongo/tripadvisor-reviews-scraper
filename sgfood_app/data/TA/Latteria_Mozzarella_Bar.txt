Nice place. You can sit inside and outside.
The food was good but not special.
The waiters were friendly.
Location is good. Surrounded by many bars and restaurants.
4
Layout of the restaurant is nice, both inside and outdoors. Food is all very good. There is a wide choice of mozzarella dishes to choose from. Their mains are also delicious, especially the osso bucco. Staff are friendly and very attentive too.
4
Location is nice, and food is good. Who likes mozzarella is recommended place. Service not excellent but acceptable.
5
A lovely, cosy restaurant with a nice terrace. I was happy with all the food that we ordered, everything was deliciously fresh! Service staff was pleasant. i would definitely come back for more. My favorites are the 'Affumicata Porcini Mushrooms' and the 'Roasted Red Snapper Fillet, Sauteed Tuscan Kale, Smoked Peppers Puttanesca Sauce'. I love this place
4
We were here for Christmas eve dinner and were seated inside the restaurant. There is also alfresco outdoor dining to choose from. Food price is mid high, and service was good. We were recommended the 300g Burrata from Puglia and it was really good. Then we added a mozzarella with parma ham which was not too nice though compared to the milky burrata. The lamb shank with 2 large shanks priced at $38, is a huge portion but was not sufficiently flavored. The baked egg plant parmigiana ($22), was delicious. The baked penne was wonderful too. To complete our meal, we ordered some desserts, and the tiramisu and meringue was the best i have ever tasted
5
Every trip to Singapore is not complete without coming to Latteria! It's still the best and non pretentious Italian in town. The 300g burrata and sweet peppers is the ultimate go to and their porcini mushroom pasta bake is yummyyyy!! Thank you once again for the wonderful meal! And special thanks to the service crew for hydrating me (was under the weather)..
5
Ask for a table outside, and enjoy the atmosphere. Gardens like these are far apart in downtown Singapore. Have visited here many times, and always get a reminder why we keep coming back... Try the Gnocchi and the Tiramisu - and everything else. And not too expensive. Love this place
3
We went there cos most of the restaurant in the area were closed on a Sunday night. The menu is large but nothing impressive on it. As nothing attracted us in the main section we decided to share different starter. Most of the starter are made with mozzarella (mozza bar) and they all seem the same without much imagination. Dishes were good but made me feel they were overpriced. From an italian restaurant/bar i would have expected more originality in the dishes. Wine selection was fine and we enjoyee a good Chianti. We overall spent a good evening but even if we had a good food quality, i rate only 3 stars because of the selection of dishes
4
We have been to Latteria three times now and always enjoy the food and service Went today to try their brunch option which is based on a sharing concept The food was well presented and very tasty as always with a selection of appetisers,mains and deserts All good though for those who don’t have a sweet tooth there needs to be a savoury desert option say a cheese platter The free flow Prosecco was very good value at 20$ a head Daniel was an excellent host and prepared a special desert for my wife’s birthda
3
We were there either on 2nd Sept. My daughter was visiting from Melbourne and we decided to take her to Latteria Mozza. The Burrata was fantastic as always. My husband ordered the Scampi for the main course. When the dish arrived there was no meat in the scampi and the shell was dry. My husband called a waiter to tell him that there was no meat in the scampi and the waiter said "This is what Scampi is" Having lived in Australia for many years and have eated Scampi almost every week, we felt disappointed with the attitude. Not a word of sorry -nothin
5
great place to sit outside on the terrace and eat fresh Mozzarella.
The Pasta dishes and whole fish is highly recommend too.
3
The night we visited the restaurant, the place is not crowded but very noisy. We can't have a decent conversation, so we asked to be transferred to the table at the corner. Food is nice but pricey. Service is very good.
5
The atmosphere was amazing. The food fresh and delicious. We enjoyed this restaurant very much! Definitely going back.
3
I had a business dinner in Latteria. Maybe it is my fault, but I cannot remember any special food or wine. It has two meanings: it was not awfully bad or extremely yummy.
The service was ok; sitting outside in garden was pleasant.
4
Good valued meal at our favourite Italian joint with good friends to mark the Restaurant Week! We choose from the set lunch menu. The appetiser, main meal and dessert were very satisfying. The bread was crunchy. Service and ambience were excellent.
4
The food and the service was very good and the ambience of the restaurant was great. I definitely would like to visit the restaurant again.
2
Service, not great! Food ok not exactly fine dining, but for the price acceptable. Staff, not the friendliest, it was my Mother's Day treat....
won't be returning
3
Some friends suggested to have dinner here on a weekday. Surprisingly full, with many Westerners and almost no locals. Place was a bit loud to have a decent conversation, although outdoors, but ambience was nice.Food ordered was Gnocchi with Truffle Oil. Not easy to find good gnocchi in the region, and this one passed. But other than that nothing too special. I did hope for a bit more for a relatively pricey menu.Staff were friendly and overall service was good
4
When a bunch of friends dragged me to this joint I feared the worst. Mozzarella in Singapore outside a mall under scorching heat and humidity? Actually this place sports eight or nine different mozzarella presentations all of them surprisingly good. The rest of the fare is correct. Wonderful outside sitting was it not for the 90% humidity
4
A nice Italian restaurant in Duxton Hill with indoor and outdoor eating area. My preference is the outdoor patio. With fans its a nice atmosphere. There is a paid parking lot within 30 feet from the restaurant that is nice. The menu has steak \ seafood and of course pasta. The portions are on the large side and the pasta tends to be on the rich side. You don't walk away hungry. They have a number of Mozzarella dishes which are all really great
1
I was assured that the pasta of the day gnocchi was vegetarian, only for me two spoonfuls in to realize the sauce was Bolognese. I barely even got an apology. 15 years in Singapore and this has never happened to me. Terrible service.
5
we stayed outside, the kids could played on the little terasse. The food is very good. The kids loved the pasta cheese prepared in a pumpkin. Price is normal for Singapore.
we will come back for sure !!!
5
Last visit was 6 months ago and I must say that I was really happy to go there again.Restaurant was packed and we could not be seated outside. Reservation is a must there.Food was excellent , specially the mac & cheese on a fresh pumpkin
3
Went there on a busy Saturday night.Had the chance to eat outside. Inside was definitely super busy and noisy, whereas the outside terrace is quite charming.Had 2 pastas and 2 glasses of wine for over 100 $.Pastas were OK but really not up to their price. Service was OK.Would we go back ? Liked the area, but found it overpriced for what you get, so most probably not
5
we were looking for a place to throw a large family oriented event and found Latteria to be perfect. - we knew the food is very good from previous visits to the restaurant (i am vegetarian so have less choice than my wife does). they managed to replicate the quality also with a crowed of 110 people. - the setting is perfect - about half the guests were kids and young teens that could go out and safely play; in doors also had great ambiance - service was wonderful - before and during the event. ask for Daniel, he is absolutely lovely!the event was a week ago, and we are still getting compliments about the great place and terrific food.highly recommended. additional notes: The place also let us add some personal touch to the decoration which was also great
5
Well seems we found our happiness. first of all the terrace is splendid in such a wonderful weather like Singapore, where the street is accessible for pedestrian.only, with a parking lot is a proximity. Food wise go for the truffles Ravioli. They are excellent. The service and all employees very nice. If you still have space tiramisu is excellent. Nice selection of wine to pair with your food. Just to tell you that we went 4 times during our stay (12.16-01.17) and next trip in April they will see us again for sure
5
Enjoyable food presentation and pairing with some very good Californian Pinot Noir. Service was equally excellent and I loved the the Burrata. Could have been a perfect nights had it not been for the full room and the "hardness" of the walls which contributed to some over the top decibels. But would still recommend and return
5
Always been great dining here. This time with a couple of friends. Shared a burrata, which is a must! Baked eggplant parmigiana and pasta. The atmosphere is nice and to TOP it up, Linsel was always there to assist us whenever we needed another round of drinks. Kudos to the management!
1
Went there with family who were visiting us. On A sunday for brunch... bad service...not friendly at all.... the brunch was approximately S$48++ (my figures may not be exact.)They said we had to "Share" the food served...we were 5 of us and we paid for each person...but for example got only 4 pieces of fish!! We asked the manager and he was rude & tried to explain the meaning of sharing !!I dont fet it as we paid $48 per person.. so isnt everyone supposed to be served??!!! Filled our stomach with carbs mostly... very less protien...just awful...waste of our sunday & money!! . Never again... We would choose Petes place/Bassilico which is 100 times better....or maybe the manager was rude because we were not drinking!!???
5
Very nice location, very romantic and also great for a dinner with friends! The menu is various, with not only mozarella plates but also pasta and meat. I had a mozarella straciatella with zucchini and it was AMAZING! They give you bread (I think the best bread in Singapore) with a bit of olive oil to dip in which so good! The desert (meringue with cream) was not too sweet and vary good! I would recommend to go there to everyone although some waiters are not that nice and polite (but it is a detail)
2
Lovely setting and great service, but pretty disappointing food. The burrata was tougher than I remember, the garlic prawns were very bland and some not completely cooked. The lamb shank was poor too. Surprising given it's high rating on this.
5
What can I say? Would you like to eat real and tasty italia food served with passion buy professional Italian? Male yourself a gift and go to Latteria. Unforgettable good in a magic romantic frame in the heart of Singapore. Buon appetito.
4
Along with the lovely outdoor ambience especially on a breezy december evening, this pretty place has some great food as well. I personally recommend the gnocchi (infused with truffle oil, cannot recall the exact name of the dish). The portion sizes are pretty large, so you might want to share. Service, well, was efficient, but our server was kind of brusk, when I asked him to give me some pasta recommendations, he just told me that its personal and to look through the menu :/. All in all, minus the nitty gritties, it was a good experience
4
A lovely setting for an evening dinner, with great food and o.k service. The food is classic Italian with a good selection of wines to mix and match. The hardest part of the evening was getting the attention of the waiting staff who had a tendency to walk past with seeing you. Having said that, we enjoyed our food and had a great evening. Very worth while
5
My friends, my husband and I went to dinner at Latteria Mozzarella Bar last week and took up the $48 early dinner tasting and $30 wine pairing the restaurant has as their special promotion for November. I did not opt for wine pairing but every one at the table especially my husband raved about the quality of the wine paired with each dish of the 4 -course dinner tasting menu. The appetisers were served and we loved a wide variety of yummy cheese. Gnocchi dish was delicious and when paired with refreshing Pinot Grigio, it was just so amazing that my husband rated it as his favourite dish/pair of the night. Then we had three options for main, lamb shank, seabass and beef. I had lamb shank at this restaurant before so I decided to go with seabass. I would say that lamb is still my favourite main course. Then we ended with tasty panna cotta and tiramisu. Because Tiramisu has alcohol content, I opted for panna cotta and loved it. The average bill came up around $90 if you have wine pairing and less than $60 if no wine. The al fresco atmosphere made this place one of my favourites in Singapore.
3
Managed to reserve a table during Restaurant Week! A set dinner of 4 courses for $38 was really superb!Gnocchi was tasty- I didn't fancy mushroom so Chef kindly substituted the truffle for me. The porcini sauce did not have overpowering flavour so it was really palatable Parma ham quality could be improved as the "porky" note was quite distinct! My friend had beef and she found the exterior texture tough and medium rare on the inside although medium doneness was requested. Furthermore it was not as flavourful as she would expect. The pork shoulder I ordered was brilliant- tender, juicy and done perfectly
4
Went for dinner. Overall good evening. Hits and miss on the dishes. We shared a dew starters - Good burrata, standard bufalo, baked eggplant below average this round.For mains, we shared the famous Mac n Cheese and the Lamb shank. Mac n cheese was spectacular, probably still one of the best in Sg. The lamb shank while good used to he much better. Meat still falls off the bones, excellent portion size however bland, not flavorful or as fresh as I have hadvhere before.We shared a few drinks and bottle of wine of their good selection of wines.Will go back for the mac n cheese and drinks and general ambience and service
5
This is a lovely hidden treasure on Duxton Hill. Great place to escape the rush of the city. It has a beautiful terrace and garden. The food was absolutely amazing. We had the mozzarella with eggplant and pinenuts for starter. Superb! Even my husband who usually is no big fan of mozzarella loved this starter. Also the pasta dishes were delicious (crab linguine and spinach ricotta ravioli). Staff was very friendly and patience with our two small children. Definitely a restaurant I would like to go back to
4
I like the cheese served by the restaurant. It's not those traditional cheese platter but mozzarella cheese with combination other food as ingredients. Eat with the wine and bread, it's heavenly enjoyable. The potion is quite huge and I always eat the cheese like a main course. I have been there several times and they recently renovated
5
The food - superb! The atmosphere - spectacular! (Both inside and fabulous outside dining) The service - great! We had the sea bass stuffed with garlic and herbs and the pasta bake. Many other dishes at neighboring tables looked equally spectacular. Did I mention the food was superb!
5
When you go to Duxtin Hill, please make a stop at Latteria. Very friendly staff, great food, try especially grilled cotton fish, beef, gnocchi and bruscetta. House wine is very good.
5
Great authentic Italian food (I am Italian myself) in the middle of Singapore. Very good service and fair prices given that the majority of the products come directly from Italy. Very nice al fresco ambience, to be chosen if available. Must-go place for Italian food!
5
I come to visit Singapore for business / visiting friends several times a year and each time I always go to Latteria as quite simply it's phenomenal food, BEAUTIFUL romantic setting with all its fairy lights amongst the trees and great wine.
Highly highly recommend.
4
We enjoyed a nice outside dinner as a family of four. Duxton Hill has a great ambiance. The food is great and service was quick.
4
Great location with a wonderful large terrace for outside dining with a lovely atmosphere. The pasta dish I had was excellent it was one the specials with service that was authentic and genuine. Highly recommended to you all.
4
Latteria is a mozzarella bar with incredible choice and freshness
The terrace is amazing and nicely located on Duxton Hill
A few pasta dishes also available if you like not to indulge in antipasti
A great stop for an evening in Tanjong Pagar
5
Walking through Duxton Hill in search of a diner, we came across a great outdoor dining place at Latteria Mozzarella Bar. Upon looking at the menu I noticed a starter "Burrata, Sweet Peppers Peperonata". Burrata is not very common in Italian restaurant and when done right it has a fantastic texture and taste.For a main course, I noticed a "Porcini & Burrata Pasta Bake" - I am the type of person that usually do not eat pasta in a restaurant as it is fairly simple to make at home.. I am glad I was so wrong, as this main course was the best pasta I have ever had; Nothing came close to that, period.Top notch service, not too invasive, not out of reach - I warmly recommend this restaurant for a nice evening out enjoying great Italian food in Singapore - This place is now my favorite Italian there
5
I was with a friend looking for a place to have lunch during a particularly hot afternoon, last week, when we took a chance on Latteria. We both had different mains and desserts and were just raving about the food afterwards. I had the pasta carbonara which was a delight and finished off with the Tiramisu which was wonderfully indulgent. My friend had a pasta dish which she really liked and finished off with the pistachio ice cream, which she thought was home made, because it was "just too good"!Please note that they do not have a set lunch menu but don't let that hold you back
5
I visited Latteria Mozzarella for lunch with a large group of 20 ladies and they took great care of us. With such a large group, I was impressed with the speed and politeness of the service. Food was great; I had the tomato soup and herb crusted Dory. Choice of 3 gelato flavors for the set lunch dessert: chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio. Would like to return for dinner as the setting looks like it would be really magical at night time. Seating indoors or out on terrace available
4
This was another repeat visit with some friends. And I was not to be disappointed a great evening with excellent food and service. The wines selections are always good and if in doubt ask. A great place and so accommodating. Enjoy your evening on the hill
4
Located on the top of the hill opposite Luca Loco. Nice alfresco setting at night. Serves Menabrea and Perroni. Desserts are a generous size.
5
Dined here last weekend and managed to sit outdoor. Service was impeccable, food was great and outdoor seating feels magical. When dine here, one must have the burrata. Will come back again when I'm in town. Kudos to the team! Grazie Mille
4
Great atmosphere, service and food! This was my third time to this restaurant and I was pleased every time. Will be back again...
5
A perfect place to hangout casual with friends , business partners...Location in Duxton Hill is perfect , recommend to eat outside as inside is not that nice.Mozzarella and pasta are really good. Service is great and casual.Prices are ok not too high.Would definitely go back there
4
We went to the restaurant known as ' the mozarella bar' to taxi drivers. The Spritz was authentic, as were the pastas served. Seating on a large terrace, we had several kinds of burrata and eggplant. Dishes were served quickly, were appetizing and not to big. The pasta is rather expensive to European norms but fair to Singa norms.Red snapper came with rucola. Wine being of fair quality, we found this place having a great Italian authenticity and savoury food alongside very customer oriented waiters
3
Have visited this place at least 4 times in last few years, very good appetisers with decent main courses and good desert.Highlights are the cheese starter dishes & a raspberry cream & meringue desert. My last visit unfortunately was not as good as previous visits as order of mac n cheese had a strong burnt flavour. This of course impacted my evening and the overall rating I have given. The house pour red wine is also good, service is decent. Will visit again.Disclaimer: have visited italy 5-6 times in my life and love cheese
2
Fortunately I was in the best company, Among the dishes we ordered the only tasty one was the baked pasta however, it was not worth the price charged. the fish was not fresh. The service , impersonal , the ambiance inside, nonexistent. Being Italian born I have to admit the quality of the food we were served did not meet with my expectations. The disappointment was overruled by the delightful company I was in. I would not return
3
We went to Latteria, because we had few months back a nice evening with friends who invited us. Latteria has a nice terrace and that is why we came again. After that last night visit with 4 adults and some children we probably will not go there again. Average and impersonal service, sour and expensive house wine and a plate with simple pasta for 30$! There are many better Italian restaurant is Singapore serving better food in a more friendly fashion for a more reasonable price.
5
We visited in June 2016 as a couple. We had a lovely table outside, sat amongst the beautiful garden surroundings. The service was impeccable, the food absolutely to die for and the wine also stunning. You must have the Burrata!!! When we left the restaurant that evening we felt like we had had such an amazing evening we didn't want to leave. We will most certainly be back when we are next in Singapore and would like to thank ALL the stuff for making our visit so special. Highly recommend to all that are after a beautiful dinner with friends or loved ones
3
While I absolutely loved the food at latteria ( burrata, pumpkin Mac and cheese are to die for ) , their service needs to improve . We have visited this place twice and during the 2nd visit , the service was sloppy . The waiters seemed bored and irritated serving us which was a huge turn off! Other than that, I must say the location is absolutely dreamy with fairy lights and overlooking the shophouses. If the service improves , I would gladly give it 5 stars !
5
One of the coolest places! Delicious Italian food and home atmosphere! Beautiful surrounding. Several types of home-made Mozzarella! Good wine and appetizers. Amazing desserts.
5
We have been 4 times to Latteria Mozzarella and it was always very good. Maybe one of the best mozzarellas in the city.
Slow cooked Lamb shank is perfect to share for 2. Lemon sorbet is amazing.
5
Latter is is located in a really nice area with trees and some other restaurants, if you sit outside you will enjoy a good environment, with tall tables for you to enjoy your time at dinner. I've been there 3 times and all of them was super well received by the staff, food is really fresh and tasty and the wines in the house are good as well.Try the mozzarella starters or the pasta dishes, everything tastes just delicious as an typical Italian meal should be.
1
This is typical Singaporean service. The manager rude, the waiters rude. we were party of 12. And we spend more than 800 Singapore dollars. They seemed to be annoyed serving us. one of the waiter spilled a hot garlic butter prawn to my friend's dress. And no apology what so ever. Until we told them. I have my international friends that night, They were upset by the food and services. Will not come back for sure. So many Italian restaurants in Singapore to choose from. Bye
3
Girls night out, lots of appetizers and cheese, we had lots of laughs and wine and some light dessert, but I wasn't too impressed with the food, honestly. The service was decent, always trying to bring yet another bottle of wine, but that's what they are told to do, probably..
5
Great place, very relaxed and superb service. Even thought we were helped by a part-timer, Stuart, the level of service he portrayed was superb. He even advised us on the qualtity of food, which was probably a bit on the high volume. He was right, but we ordered an additional Buffalo Mozzarella anyway. As a main the grilled Seabass. Perfect.Good wine advise too. You better make reservations, because on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday this place is packed
5
This was a my friend's birthday evening. we have been other restaurants in Singapore for birthday evening before but here was the best place we have.The ambiance is terrific. Outdoor terrace would definitely be good choice. Especially, Service was really impressed they really made our special day.Also the food was nice which was advised by server I regret that I dont remember his name but he was really kind and attentive.I will certainly return in the future :
5
My lunch ,at Latteria,40,Duxton Hill,was excellent.The food,the ambience,the service,the location in a beautiful restored shophouse,was just perfect.We had a feast,of antipasti,three main courses,dessert ,and coffee.The Prosecco ,was complimentary and towards the tail end a rose was given to all mothers.I have always loved Italy and the Italian cuisine.Eating in Latteria,was like being transported back to Italy,through the food.The waiters as well as the chefs,were particularly pleasant and v attentive.The Cod with tomato sauce as well as gnocchi suffused in a very tasty creamy sauce with porcini mushrooms is a must try.I will certainly return in the very near future.A gem of a restaurant,where casual dressing is accepted to
4
Nice setting, excellent mozzarella (try the burrata as starters), good wine, excellent linguine a la Vongole and so far the best tiramisu I had in Singapore ! I advise outdoor tables to enjoy Duxton hill setting.I just regret the waiter was a bit rude and when we asked for an ashtray he just gave us the one from another table where people just left without cleaning it ... Wine is also good and prices are reasonable
4
Not easy to compete for best pasta.. Here is a good address in a very nice location close to club street, with super good mozza and burrata dishes : fresh and juicy. With large pasta gratins : i recommend the mac and cheese in a pumpkin, just perfect ! Tiramisu was very nice too.Portions are marge so better to under order and share... Enjoy !
4
Nice outdoor setting. good menu and wine list. Quality food and friendly service. Lots of other restaurants in the area, so good options.
5
It's a surprise to find a sweet nice place like La Latteria, at Singapore with all the modern city around it. It's a cozy fun place to enjoy a great dinner and great Italian food around mozzarella and other great dishes
4
Great al fresco dining experience in a very nice part of town. The cheese and starters were awesome and a meal in themselves.
Great outdoor ambience, the fans and plants surrounding the garden made for a very pleasant lunch.
4
i love the burrata dishes, and the cocktails (negroni, aperol spritz). burrata dishes are a bit big and to be shared by 2 persons for a starter. very nice service, perfect for a weekend dinner.
3
To sum it all: food was just ok. High pricing I guess considering Italian (foreign) restaurant way down in the lion city. Service was good. Nice outdoor seating. I suppose if you were an italian missing "home" food you'd flock down here. But I've tasted better and you surely can do better
5
On vacation with friends who took us to this lovely place in Duxton Hill. Nice al fresco seating even in the balmy Singapore evenings. Started with a burrata and the nice house Chianti. Mains included the baked sea bass, pumpkin gnocchi and a most wonderful lamb shank. Beware the mains are huge and can feed 2-3 !Service was really attentive - I spent a fascinating few minutes watching the manager personally check each wine glass laid out by the barman before he sent them out. Defiantly a place I would return to.
5
This was a "make up" evening for some great friends from India who had missed our anniversary dinner 6 months ago. The experience was even better than beforeThe ambience is terrific. Outdoors would definitely be my choice - we sat at the long table overlooking the bar. But the area under the canopy would be as nice - possibly nicer. The gentle breeze blowing and the moderate temperature made the setting perfect. As before, I didn't look beyond the burrata for starters. The creamy burrata, subtle herb flavouring nestled on crisp lettuce and cherry tomatoes - this is the high point of a meal at Latteria. Wash it down with the house Chianti or Italian beer on tap as we did - and I promise you an experience you won't regret. Their cold cuts platter is splendid - they don't always have it but ask the waiter for it when you go next. The mains are large - and can be shared. The lamb shank was wonderful. So was the veggie gnocchi, the crab linguini and the whole roasted sea bass. They had a veal main in August that was memorable. Hoping they put it back on the menu!We chose a pannacotta instead of our usual Tiramisu for dessert. Would confidently recommend both. For me, though, what makes Latteria stand apart is the service. The floor manager, Daniele, and server, Linsel, made us feel really special. They were unobtrusive and very sensitive to our needs. Their advice on the food and pairing was very sound.Prices are reasonable. A meal for 5 with wine and beer set us behind by around SGD 300/-In short, I can see myself going back to Latteria - any time the craving for authentic Italian food sets i
3
Came here recently to try the set lunch, 2 courses for $25++ including coffee. I was a little disappointed with the salad which was served without much dressing. But once I got some extra dressing it was fine. The fish for the main course was quite tasty. The coffee was fairly average. I've been here previously for dinner and I think the food at dinner is quite a bit better
4
Our group of 8 ladies ate here before going out for drinks on a Sunday night. Atmosphere was casual and food was brought out in a timely manner. Portions for appetizers were a bit small but the pasta entrees were generous. Overall the food quality for price was quite reaosnable for Italian food in Singapore
5
I was there for my husband anniversary. I really ate too much because it was so good! We had the Buffada as an appetizer, it was so big, it could have been for 4 people!! I followed with the lobsert pasta...wow...could not finish as the portion were well-sized! I can't wait to go back to this restaurant! Amazing cheese bar
4
With friends for dinner, fresh and nice italian food. Salads, garlic bread, appetizers ... all very fresh and tasty. Even waiters are smailing and efficient, so I'll come again. Not cheap, though ... as most S'pore restaurants
4
The burrata is the best that I've had! The setting is very nice at night when you can sit outside in the garden.
4
Located on Duxton Hill with a nice garden to chill out, this is a good place to have a wide variety of Burrata to choose from.
Efficient service, good quality.
5
This place is one of my favourite places to dine out in Singapore and I frequently go there for the super delicious food. The Linguine crab is one of the best in town and it is a paradise for cheese lovers. Totally recommended.
3
I really liked the choices of mozzarella cheese and the appetizers were really nice. The main courses though were not too impressive and the wine was average. The atmosphere is quite pleasant and they have an outside sitting area. The place is nice to meet up with friends but not for fine dining
4
Recently went to Latteria with a large party for a business meal. The service was very good - they managed a party of 20 very well. I had the grilled whole sea bass - which was exceptionally well cooked and tasty! You have to deal with a whole fish (bones, etc) but it was so well cooked, with a crispy and tasty skin that it was well worth the effort.The cheeses we had as starters were also darn good, but nothing beats that fish
5
First time here (well both times) we had the homemade mozzerella. It was delicious! For the main course, the first trip I have the roasted red snapper. Big portion and very tasty. Second time I had the Crab Linguine. That was amazing. We had some great wine there as well. Highly recommend
4
Easily located in Duxton Hill, La Latteria is definitely worth a visit. Good atmosphere in outside dining area with just the right amount of atmospheric lighting.We visited as a group and went for sharing plates as the extensive menu made it difficult to decide on an individual dish. We just wanted to try them all!As its name implies, there was a lot of choice in the way burritos and burrito as were presented, but for me calamari win every time. La Latterias were perfect - with a crispy coating and not too many stringy tail pieces! The fresh burratas were not at all stringy as they might have been. Perhaps would have appreciated some good focaccia here to accompany!On to mains. For me the star of the show was the macaroni cheese served in a baby pumpkin, so clever to serve carbs and veggies in one go! So simple but yet so different! This was closely followed by the crab linguini, which resembled Vesuvius with flaked crabmeat taking the place of the summit and lava flow, and also surprisingly the macaroni with cheese and pancetta. So creamy, yet with just the right amount of smoky bacon flavour under a crispy canopy of caramelised cheese. The men in our party were well satiated, with sirloin steak and lamb shank choices. Staff were attentive and efficient but not overbearing in their presence
3
Initially thought it looked good but found the experience disappointing. The staff were not very friendly and my penne dish was over-seasoned. Also, there was a music speaker by our table which made conversation difficult and although we asked if it could be turned down a shade (twice) it did not get any better. To be fair, we might have got them on a bad night because the setting was magic and I know some people loved it. But I can't get round the fact that the food was distinctly average

I liked the place. But I didn't like the foods. Perhaps they were not my type of foods since they were ordered by my French friend. For my own steak, it was nice but everything else was not to my taste. It would be a nice place for evening time. beautiful shops around it
5
Loved the burrata though had to share as it was a tad big. The atmosphere was cheery and bustling on a Friday night. Great food, service and ambience! Importantly, great family time. Will be back again!

Horrible food and bad service.. The fish wrapped in Parma ham was not cooked in the center.. Squid ink gnocchi with crab had shells inside.. The food was not impressive at all.. Would not come back again.

For those who love to stay away from aircon latteria is the the ideal place to dine. The ammbience is really very nice. The service staff is excellent and knowledgable .

Lovely food and house red was very drinkable! Sat outside with our coffee,limoncello and grappa at the end of the evening. Friendly staff too
5
Wonderful.Great experience. Latteria never fails. The service excellent, food fabulous and the ambience -I felt I was in Italy.

If you love Mozzarella dishes which are well portioned, look no further.
Hearty Italian dishes, especially the cheeses. Also, last i had the leg of lamb, i couldn't even finish!
Great outdoor area on a nice cool night.

A lovely find on Duxton Hill. Nice place with an Italian atmosphere and attractive terrace outside complete with vines and hanging lanterns. If it wasn't for the Singaporean skyline in the background you could almost imagine yourself in an Italian village square.Ate at Latteria on Friday night. Came by at 8pm with no reservation and there were quite a few tables still available so we decided to walk up the hill and then come back later, after just 20minutes when we returned they were packed out! Encouraged we sat at the bar to wait for a table and watched the appealing looking dishes come out of the kitchen. Then after 20minutes, as promised, out to the table.This restaurant is a mozzarella bar, so called as they have an impressive selection of mozzarella cheeses as part of the menu.... But do not despair they also have a great selection of hearty antipasta, pasta and meat / fish main courses.Portions are generous and ingredients high quality. Food is almost home style rustic Italian. We tried 2 different mozzarella dishes to start - the prosciutto was a large portion, very nice, and the 'affumagato' (smoked mozzarella) was served with delicious portobello mushrooms. An interesting flavour but next time I'll take the fresh buffalo mozzarella or another option, many of which looked deliciousFor main course my husband had a steak (good quality and cooking but not out of the ordinary) and I had the cuttlefish (good flavour but a touch chewier than I would gave liked)Portions were very generous so we skipped dessert.All in all a nice evening, probably merits a repeat visit for us

Try out Latteria Mozzarella Bar! They have an affordable and good set lunch menu of S25++ - soup/salad, main course and coffee/tea. Ambience is good and cosy except the decibels can be loud if there is a crowd of excited diners esp loud and fast talking women/men! We thoroughly enjoyed our "catching up" meal and the camaderie, not forgetting the courteous staff and service. Do book in advance to avoid disappointment
5
We had the burrata as entrÃ©e. It was a generous serving. More than enough for 3. The cheese was absolutely beautiful and delightful. It tasted fresh and not overwhelming at all. We also had the mac and cheese which was simple and yet one of the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted. Service was great. They really looked after us. Restaurant setting was nice too be it indoor or outdoor.
5
Another hidden gem, what a great evening. Awesome venue, excellent food and a great wine list. The service was brilliant just there enough to take orders and clear dishes and offer some advice but otherwise you were just left alone. The menu is brilliant with something for all tastes from the starters to mains and dessert you will not leave hungry or disappointed and like a true Italian no pizza. Good wine selection to boot. Make a booking for a Saturday its full with a great vibe there is outdoor seating so sit outside. Do not miss out we will be back. Thank you

Love Latteria Mozzarella Bar, the food and service are excellent. Only wish they'd update their pasta menu.
5
As the name suggests, fresh mozzarella is their speciality and it's definitely great. But I love the cozy atmosphere and friendly service as well. Nice choice to go with your close friends or lover. Highly recommended.
4
Loved the italian food especially the buraata .. great evening well spent with friends.. delicious food and beautiful setting
5
Absolutely brilliant place, loved everything we ordered from the starters to the dessert and the atmosphere was also great, will definitely be back here.
5
A friend recommended this place and it was simply amazing. The waiter recommended some of the very best appetizers for mozzarela. The table had lamb(fall of the bone perfection), linguine crab and a pasta bake. I highly recommend a visit. Of all the hits or misses, this is a hit!
5
Two weeks ago I went to Catalunya and had an absolutely pitiful lunch special (small portions and crap food). Today I went to Latteria and had an AWESOME lunch special for about 1/2 the price. The food is authentic Italian fare made and served by Italians. You don't get that at many Italian restaurants in Singapore. I LOVE this place and will be headed back.

Starting with the best first .. Latteria is tucked away in a really nice location in Duxton Hill with its own patio with plenty of seating that looks great at night. Good, efficient service.Didn't have the mains, just had plenty of items from their mozzarella bar menu as that's what they're apparently known for. The food was good, but for a place with mozzarella bar in the name, somehow just expected more. Would have been a solid four rating had the food delivered just a wee bit more oomph
5
Great place for lunch. Had the set brunch menu and it was great, a bit of everything, all the dishes had lots of flavour and presented really nicely. The service was very good which made the lunch a very enjoyable experience. The list was ok not a lot of choice though. Would definitely go back to this restaurant.
4
Loved it here. Fantastic setting and a very much welcome European feel. The food was excellent, the wine reasonably priced and the service was also very good. I had the special of tagliatelle with pork ragout and it was outstanding. Will definitely take our next guests there
4
Some of the mozzarella dishes are great (Bufala), some happen to turn out average at best (Bocconcini w/ Avocado). Prices can be a bit on the steep side, but considering a supermarket-packaged ball costs S$10+, it isn't too bad.Other food dishes don't particularly stand out (we had the lunch deal dishes) but it's quite good value for money, and anyway the service was impeccable
5
Nice food and good service! Not so many people in weekday lunch time. Lunch set menu is value for money!

Was there for a department farewell dinner with 8 other colleagues. Seems like a popular place as we overheard some walk-ins being told the wait time/turned away. I noticed majority of the guests were expats too.The evening started off on the wrong foot - we asked for recommendations for starters and was suggested a mix platter. We all thought that was a good idea and agreed. Unfortunately, the server didnt take our order. Only when we checked later did we realise it. And he didnt dare approach our table for the rest of the evening. His other colleagues were left defending him.A similar issue occurred during orders of our mains, this time with the Italian manager. When we asked for recommendations, we dont expect someone to just read out what is on the menu! I don't know the difference between a buratta and a bocconicini!Nonetheless, our orders were sorted out and i have to say the food was delicious! Nice ambiance to be seated outside. Would be better if the service level could be improved (ie - a little less arrogance please thank you

Visited Latteria with another couple over the weekend. We had reserved a table indoors but upon reaching the venue we decided that outdoors would be perfect hence we put in a request and managed to get a table outdoors. They had fans lining the walls and the around tables, hence it wasn't too hot even as Singapore was going through a dry & hot spell. Thankfully we sat outdoors as it was very noisy inside.We got half a carafe of their house wine which was very reasonably priced and dug in to the complimentary warm bread basket. For appetizers we got an eggplant parmigiana and one of the cheeses from their mozarella bar; we went for a mozzarela with fig sauce. They did have many other options including two burratas. Both the appetizers were sized perfectly for sharing among 4 people. For mains we got two of their baked pastas and one portion of the spiral sausage. The pastas were big portions, certainly too much for one average person; the sausage too was a generous serving and though tasty was a bit too dry for my liking, hence mustn't be had as a main by itself but more as an accompaniment with some pasta dishes. The pannacota was humongous, I skipped on the desserts but those who had it said that it was good, not too sweet though. Shall certainly visit again soon and try their grilled fishes. The service was broadly good, the Italian gentleman did forget our request for extra bread basket but outside of that we didn't have any complaints

One of the best Italian eateries in town. Whether for a family lunch/dinner or a night out with friends or socialising with business associates who all love good food, Latteria Mozzarella Bar in Duxton Hill is always a great choice. The friendly atmosphere of the historic setting and the simple Italian style provincial decoration makes you start the visit with a smile the minute you set foot on the vast and welcoming veranda. Daniele Fiore, the wonderful young Italian host and his equally friendly staff, make you feel at home already before you are ushered to your table. Then the feast begins, addressing the needs for all your five senses. Though the menu can be see a little limited, Latteira does not claim to be a fine dining restaurant, just a simple Mozzarella Bar but with some great food. They focus on what they do best and they do is really well. And the best part is that no matter what time of the day or what kind of occasion or group, you can always count on good food and Daniele and his team to make the visit a pleasant experience. I have been visiting Latteria many times over the last three years and probably sampled the whole menu and have yet to find something that i did not like that much. If after the generous portions of Latteria you still have room for a dessert, then try the Tiramisu or the Pannacotta or simply Gelato, you will leave with an even broader smile. :-) Make sure you make a reservation especially at weekends, as many people have discovered this gem and dinner time is almost always busy..

I was intrigued by the idea of a restaurant that used Mozzarella as its primary USP. Landed there for a business lunch with a few of my colleagues. The location is beautiful - central enough, yet tucked away in a quiet corner of Duxton Hill, giving it quite the European feel.The menu's first page explains all the different kinds of Mozzarella they have and that was pretty much enough to raise expectations. They also had complementary bread with olive oil and Balsamic. The bread was fresh and soft, and whet our appetite for more. We ordered Burrata & Bocconcini plates and Salads for the table. The cheeses were delicious - the Burrata was creamy and luscious, and the Bocconcini had beautiful texture and the freshness was to die for. For mains, we ordered various things: Porcini Burrata Pasta Bake was what I had (had a lovely smokiness to it) which was fair. The other orders included Seafood Pasta, Sea Bass, and Chicken Spaghetti. Opinions varied from average to not very good. We had Cappuccinos to round off the meal and it was aromatic and delicious.In all, the cheese was good and so was the coffee. The mains - not so much. I would probably go back for cheese and drinks, and an evening ambiance
3
Their choice of fresh mozzarella is just to die for, fresh, imported from Italy (at a price though). We could (should) have made our dinner out of a selection of starters because the mains were a bit heavy to our taste.Lovely service, Italian accent here and there, nice local waiters. Tip : book ahead for a table outside as it is quite noisy inside
4
At first I wasn't so keen of going there since I was a little skeptical about the mozzarella concept, expecting only mozzarella on the menu. Turned out to be a great night. Restaurant was not crowded (Monday night) so getting a table was no issue in contrast with some other reviews.We sat outside, nice atmosphere, nice and big terrace with all the lights. Food was really good. I had baked pasta al telephona (penne, tomato sauce, mozzarella in the oven), heavy but amazing taste. Friend had a specialty mozzarella with sweet peppers (big portion, enough as a main despite the fact they promote the specialties as starters (to share)), also very good. The different types of mozzarella are all explained on the menu. - Only one (or two?) veggie option in the pasta dishes, some in the specialties.+ got served ice water right after we got seated! Very convenient! + the bread is very good! with some olive oil and balsamico to dip + we had a good service but reading the other reviews this can be a bit random it seems+ duxton hill is a nice area, so if you don't find what you're looking for here, many other options
3
The irony of this Italian is that the service was better than the food. From the starter to the mains the food is far too heavy to enjoy. The cheese is actually overwhelming and spoils the meal as an experience, especially on the pasta dish.Our main fish dish was bony despite asking for it be de-boned and by that stage the cheese had overwhelmed us in the starter and first main, the pasta.They need to think about less being more and quantity is not everything with heavy dishes
5
Pre-ordered dishes due to the size of our party, including two types of burrata with bread and oils, seafood spaghetti, macaroni cheese inside a pumpkin, sausage, slow-cooked lamb, slow-cooked whole sea-bass; and desserts to share afterwards. The burrata was genuinely one of the best things I have ever eaten; fresh, creamy, and lightly decorated with pumpkin seeds and truffle oil. The spaghetti was good, the lamb and sea bass very good, and the macaroni cheese served in a baked pumpkin was outstanding. Was too full to try the desserts!! Good wine and beers, attentive service, and a lovely spot outdoors on the decked area although I did get a couple of mozzie bites. Perfect for our party of 18. Nightmare trying to catch a taxi afterwards though!
5
Our preferred restaurant in Singapore so far. Great terrace in the middle of Duxton Hill. The Mozzarela dishes are outstanding and so fresh. Coupled with a Nero D avola this is definitely the place love to go back to on a regular basis for a dine at 2 or with friends. Of course you need to like mozza - we did not try the rest of the main courses. The panna cotta is just amazing also! But book early as this super hard to get a table. The Italian owner is very nice. A bit pricy (like most restaurant in Singapore outside of the food courts) but one of the only one where it is worth it
4
the food and atmosphere are really good, my advice is to not forget to keep space for the tiramisu it worst it!!
4
Sitting outside, in a breast evening, enjoying the music and fantastic Italian food. I recommend this restaurant for couples and friends.
4
This was the first time we visited Latteria. The ambiance was nice and the staff was attentative. The food was nicely presented and tasted authentic. We will certainly tell our friends about the place. Overall a pleasant experience.
3
I was in Latteria few months ago. I took risotto and it was OK, but not impressive, I never came back and, honestly, I won't. There are many good restaurants in Singapore, and hundreds of new restaurants every year, so why should patronize an average one
5
If you love Mozzarella to the extent of having it in almost every dish - this place is a must visit!! Their portion sizes are excessively generous so bear that in mind while ordering unless you don't mind skipping all meals the next day! Despite a packed restaurant and with no reservations, we were warmly greeted, accommodated and assisted all through the dining experience. The Italian manager (I guess) was a one man wonder, taking multitasking to a whole new level! Perfect place for a lovely evening out, great food, good service, beautiful setting. Just work up an appetite before you dine here...it's a mozzarella marathon and do try their tipsy tiramisu!!
1
Under normal circumsatances make a booking. And you won't have to hang around for an hour. Sense of smuggness from the senior staff. I am sure they face this situation every weekend... so you think they'd have a reasonable knowledge about the wait time. Didn't hang around for food.. You'd think there would be the courtesy to update customers... to give the option earlier to bail out

We came here to celebrate my birthday with some good friends. Having been here a couple of times before (but not for a year or so), we we're keen to return. We had reserved a table outside. Things started off ok. But having had the specials explained (and slightly pushed on us) we then requested a reminder as to how the menu worked. As is often the case when you have 6 people trying to make decisions, the ordering process was a little lengthy. This is where things started to become 'strained'. The second waiter we had, was particularly rude, constantly raising his eyes to heaven and huffing and puffing at us (I wonder if he was the same one others have mentioned), and making us all feel very uncomfortable. The biggest cringe-worthy moment (if there is such a word) was when my friend's mother politely asked if the head from her whole fish could be removed. Well, the face on said waiter had to be seen to be believed. Everything was obviously too much trouble for him. It was at that moment that I had to bite my tongue, lip and everything else to stop myself exploding at him. Had I been there just with my husband I'm sure that I/we would have. We were then given the dessert menu and each of us selected something. It was as these arrived that the staff chose to arrive with a 'birthday' tiramisu. A nice gesture, but unfortunately we already had our desserts. Why didn't they bring it out before the dessert menu was given to us? Hmmm . . . . now let me think . . . The joke was, that when the bill arrived, we were told that the birthday tiramisu was 'on the house'. Sadly, I had to take it away in a 'doggy bag' as we were all too full to enjoy it.We will not be returning to this restaurant. The waiting staff really let it down (understatement), with the exception of one lovely Filipina lady who was very helpful. Sadly we didn't get her name
4
We stopped in here with some local friends when a nearby restaurant had far too long a wait for a table. This place was also busy, but they seated us quickly and we enjoyed the friendly and relaxed service throughout.The menu was ideal for sharing dishes: the portions were generous, and everything we ordered was tasty and freshly cooked.We sat outside and enjoyed the good atmosphere among the late evening crowd.Certainly the good company helped, but in any case it was a nice evening out and I'd recommend the place
3
We were walking around the tanjong pagar, duxton and tras street areas looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night. Most places were closed and we stumbled into Latteria. Dining can be indoors or outdoors and most of the diners chose outdoors for a breezy evening and indoors was mostly emptyImmediately we were seated and ice water was poured without asking, which was nice. We went straight to the mains. My lamb shank was a giant generous portion and tasted ok. My friend's pork sausage however was less impressive looking. For dessert we shared the cheese platter and before that we asked what the cheeses were. The waitress had to ask the kitchen and came back with 4 names, still not knowing what they meant. The cheeses were o

This will be a review about service only as we never got to dine in the restaurant. We called at about 6pm to try and book a table for 2 for 730pm - surprisingly the guy who answered the phone told me that we didn't need to make a reservation and that we could just walk in for the night. I was quite surprised as it was a Saturday night so repeated the request and even specified that we would like an outdoor seat - and again he said it was no problem just come on along as they didn't have too many bookings for the night. Delighted, we ordered another cocktail and slowly made our way there by 730pm - to our annoyance, we were greeted by the front of house who upon finding out we didn't have a reservation immediately said "we are full tonight". We looked around and saw loads of tables which were empty! The place was just about half full. As we pointed this out to the guy, and the fact that his colleague told us that we did not need a reservation for tonight - he went away and got someone else who came and basically told us there was no way his colleague would have said that and that we needed a reservation for that night. Good job insinuating that your customers are lying! Sorry but we are not that desperate to dine at your restaurant. Plenty other better ones in the area. And you have obviously never heard of customer service. There was no sorry maybe my colleague said that, what can I do to help etc. Then, as if an act of charity - he then proceeded to ask us if we wanted the worst looking table in the area - sat right alone across the main pathway. When we pointed to the empty seats - he again said they were reserved with no acknowledgement of what his colleague had told me. What a complete waste of time.Anyway - it was safe to say we were indignant at the way we were treated. We left and obviously will never return again. Staff (wish I got his name) needs to learn some manners and basic customer service
4
Fantastic spot! Booked for 12 friends. Staff couldn't have been more helpful, the food was outstanding and really nice ambience sitting outside on the patio. Will definitely be going back. Thanks Daniel & team.
3
Nice to sit outside to have a family/friends dinner. Price per person was about 75SGD, 2 courses and wine. Note NO pizza on menu.
4
This was a highly enjoyable evening shared with family. Our waiter was highly informative and helpful guiding us through his recommendations. The appetizers were particularly good. The wine selections was good. The main dishes were merely okay; nothing to complain about and certainly tasty. My linguine with clams was disappointing in that the clams had negligible meaty content - I've never encountered such shriveled clams before. I was a little surprised such a high class establishment served these. Most chefs would have rejected them. Deserts were very good, even Tiramisu which all too often is so-so; in this case it was excellent. We would probably try this restaurant again and select some other main dishes because everything else was very good and the ambiance and service are fine
5
I have never been to such restaurants and this blew me away when I had a client who brought me there. The wonderful pairings of wines to each and every dish is perfectly done and you really enjoy the great taste of the pizzas as well as the antipasto dishes.Ladies! Not forgetting the ice creams made upon order. It's a must!

Had dinner there during the Restaurant Week period. Made reservations for 630pm and upon arrival at 640pm, we were told indoor seating was full. The only option (or the lack of) was outdoors. Strangely, a Caucasian couple who came 5 minutes after us had a choice of indoor or outdoor seating. The four course dinner is best described as mediocre. The pasta with crab had a fishy aftertaste. The fish was okay (i.e not wow). The lamb shank was good though and so was the tiramisu.We had two rounds of drinks.First round: My partner ordered a glass of white and I had red. Both were presented in the same kind of wine glass - for white it was ok, not red.Second round: same drinks but no differentiation of wine glass. The wine glasses used were different from the first round of drinks. A decent restaurant will not serve white wine in glasses meant for red and vice versa.That said, for $35++ (meal only), it's quite decent for a fuss free dinner. Drinks are cheap too. Service: service staff were very prompt.An experience is good enough I say
3
Simply said this is a place with good food and value for money however the accustics are SO BAD that its impossible to hold on a noraml conversation as the place get terribly loud. A real pity as the food was really good and the portions are quite generous BUT i wont go back as it wasnt possible to properly hear what our friends were saying at times. Focusing on the food alone their bread was delicious and i ordered the Lamb Shank that was cooked perfectly and 2 shanks made it a very generous portion for the price. My friends ordered pasta and the spaghetti with vongole was amazing. Good value for money but as an overall experience the noisy saloon was a real let down for me. They have outdoor seating so will try go back one night to try it out
4
Let me start by saying, we visited during restaurant week. So the $35++ was an excellent and very filling value. First, it was 4 courses incl excellent crusty bread. We left very full and pleased!There was a starter that was FABULOUS. 3 small bufala mozzarella balls, breaded and deep fried on a dollop of tomato sauce (on menu listed as arrabiata but it wasn't spicy at all). It was called Bocconcini.Segundo: pasta with crab and mascarpone. This was so so. Texture of the garganello pasta had a strange bite (it's kind of like the al dente was crossed with tofu skin). And the crab flavour was in the direction of fishiness). I wouldn't go for this one again.Mains: 1. Sea bass fillet had an amazing tangy pesto sauce and was cooked to perfection. The sauce (or should I say soup) that filled the base of the bowl was created from chickpeas. At first, I thought it was a bad sauce and the flour was not amalgamated well as it was starchy. Plus the sauce was bland except when one had a bite of the dried black salty olive morsels. Somehow I think the soupy sauce would have been better if cooked longer to thicken it and release the flavour of the olives...maybe our early booking at 6:30pm meant the sauce was not yet ready!?2. Lamb shank with mushroom orzotto. This was a winner. The lamb fell of the bone and has a nice gamey flavour. The Orzotto was superb and a big highlight. The mushroom aroma was pronounced and the texture perfect. Dessert: tiramisu. This was excellent...although on the normal menu, it is called tipsy tiramisu and this one didn't have any alcohol flavour. So perhaps it was the teetotaler version?The meal included coffee or tea. We were even offered a perfect espresso in this option.Atmospere: Inside was simple and there is a lovely outdoor dining area that is not bothered by noise or traffic (due to the location on Duxton Hill) so if it were a later reservation, it would have been a lovely choice. I found inside with the a/c cooled down our food too quickly.Service was impeccable
4
we had not booked which on a Friday evening at 9:00pm in central Singapore is not very clever so we weren't surprised that the restaurant was fully booked. But instead of turning us down flatly, the staff proposed that we wait at the bar, took time to take us through some items on the mouthwatering menu and were generally very welcoming.Without fail, we got a table on the lovely patio and were truly delighted by the selection of their specialita and antipasti. Can't wait to come back to sample the artisanal pasta and mains
5
Visited this restaurant as the original place we wanted to go was full. Which was a good thing! Great place to hang out for great food. Each dish was so well done, very tasty, good portions. 3 of us shared 4 dishes and a lovely bottle of moscato d'asti. The grilled sea bass was the star - recommended by a couple in the next table. A whole sea bass grilled with lemon, tomatoes, rocket and something else on a grillplate. Maybe it's just really fresh fish! Worth every dollar. Make reservations. We arrived for an early dinner and there was nobody but don't be fooled. the wait staff said that they were full with reservations. we were lucky to get a table and the place filled up after 7pm, some patrons were turned away. our waiter was very personable and friendly
5
Every Italian Iâ€™ve spoken to says this is their favourite place and I can see why! The outdoor terrace is a great place to sit (be sure to reserve!) and enjoy a hearty Italian dish, while the all the waiters are very friendly and attentive. The Mozzarellas are super yummy and a great dish to start with before moving on to one of the larger mains. I was told that all the mozzarella is flown in fresh from Italy and you can really taste the quality of ingredients; I think it may be one of my favourites now too
4
The starters are amazing ! The mains are delicious and the terrace looks like a fairytale !
The prices are a little spicy but it is for good reason as the quality of the food is excellent !
5
Went there with a friend and we had a very nicest experience, Outside seating, nice lighting, great food (tasted different types of cheese from the menu), fine wine. But on the expensive side for 'just' cheese.
4
Lovely location - in a leafy corner of Duxton Hill, option of quaint alfresco seating as well as a smaller indoors space. We were taken there by friends during a recent holiday and will be forever grateful to them for introducing us to this gem :)Be warned - portions are quite large ! We had the Burrata with peppers which was a sublime experience in itself..and so filling with the crusty bread that we skipped mains and went straight to the dessert. The Affogato was as good as one you would get anywhere, and the Tipsy Tiramisu was creamy and indulgent...just what the doc ordered ;) !Service is prompt and knowledgeable - they knew the provenance of all their cheeses etc. Only grouse was the high level of noise in the indoor space...just one of those days I guess.All in all - a must visit if u are a cheese / Italian fan !
4
Been here at least 8 times, every time is great!! The Burrata cheese is always delicious and super fresh. Had the sea-bass last time, it was de-boned for us and very, very good. Pasta dishes are always very good too. I always like to bring my family here, and friends from out of town.I prefer to sit inside as the tables outside are too close together in my opinion but that is my only complaint
4
I was exploring around my hotel and found this gem one evening. It looked quaint, with a nice outdoor patio. The servers were very friendly and the food was delicious! I wish I hadn't been so jetlagged, I would have ordered more food. I settled on a small plate, burratta with roasted pumpkin and truffle, it was out of this world. Next time I'm in town I'm going to stop by and sample more from the menu
5
The menu isn't huge, but the cheese starters are a worthy experience, the mains are great, the venue is lovely, and the Italian waiters - while cheesier than the meals - add to the experience. On a value for money basis it just sneaks in for a 5 for me.
4
I was impressed by the impeccable service crew despite the restaurant being close to fully booked. We were served first with a warm and yummy bread basket that was promptly refilled.The starter, bocconcini was delightful although I was not wowed by the presentation. Pasta was the clear winner of the night - flavorful and perfectly al dente. I was savouring it up to the final bite. I ordered the beef cheek but also tried the sea bass. Particularly liked the tenderness of the beef and the buttery mash.The tiramisu dessert lacked a certain oomph.But all in all, it was a pleasurable experience and I'll definitely be back
3
We went to Latteria because our friends recommended the cheeses on the menu. I found it to be average. The location is nice and its got outdoor seating but the food was not that amazing that I would return. I ordered the baked seabass and was not very impressed.
2
We were served by an extremely unpleasant waiter (he seemed to be the manager). He forgot everything we asked for including balsamic vinegar, ice and another napkin and when we reminded him he did not apologise but instead went "oh" then hurried off (still not getting the things we asked for!) Risotto quite disappointing and far too big. My boyfriend had the sausage, and it really was JUST a sausage. It didn't come with anything else. They forgot our desserts and the dining inside was disastrous-far too loud and noisy. Won't be coming back (except maybe for the mozzarella.....
4
Have been here a number of times and the starters are very good...love the burrata. The main course menu is limited, but I typically have the cuttlefish. Last night there was a chicken parm special which my husband had which was very good. They should really consider putting it on the menu permanently as it would be good to have a chicken option for a main course.The tiramisu is hugeâ€”so definitely large enough to share.The service has always been good when we have been there and we enjoy sitting outside
3
Outside seating was good with nice atmosphere. Mozzarella starter was good. The other main dishes were average but the risotto was a real disappointment. Service was also average. Will not rush to go back there soon.
5
I come here frequently with colleagues and clients and every time we have leave very happy. The service is great, especially when you get to know the friendly/helpful/accommodating manager, the food although a smaller menu than I prefer everything is done perfectly, especially the special gnocchi, the price is reasonable and the atmosphere (especially on Wed night) is buzzing. The highlight is the outside decking area, the perfect place! Highly recommended

been there numerous times and only have good things to say abt this restaurant:- nice ambience (outdoors is better than in)...has a smoking area too for those chimmeys...- staff is very professional, particularly Daniel. this Italian sure knows what he is talking about.- the burata and bufala are very fresh, so are the ham which I normally order as a platter to share around.- the crab linguine is almost perfect and the chef does not skimp on the ingredients which makes this a fantastic main pasta course- try the grilled sea bass: its grilled very well and it works perfect with the lemon sprinkled over it.- finish off the night with a lemochell

Went there couple of weeks ago, i must say, the appetizer are great, the selection of different type of Mozzarella is really something, but what i found limited is the choice of main course, nothing much or special in my opinion.I will for sure go back there for the mozzarella, not for the main courses

I just discovered the Latteria with Restaurant week on March 2014. We went on Sunday lunch and were first amazed by the place. The restaurant is cosy and the terrace perfect for a nice and calm lunch under the shadow of the trees. The menu was delicious from the beginning to the end: I don't remember any dish name but the starter was mozarella with avocado and tomatoes, our main courses were cheese pasta with asparagus or beef cheeks with mashed potatoes, dessert was a tiramisu, coffee was included. Everything was good, fresh and tasty. Perfect! The service was also nice and unpretentious, we had one of the server that came and enjoyed us with a Buongiorno, they accepted to change the coffee for an espresso at the end of the lunch with no extra cost. It was a delicate experience, our children (17 and 13) liked it as well. We'll definitely come back

It was a wonderful experience at this restaurant and we just wanted to try it out since it was Restaurant Week. It was really good food and also service! The food we had was very good (Appetizers, Entree and Dessert) plus we had coffee or tea too! The beef cheek was nicely done and my husband totally enjoyed it. I enjoyed my seabass fillet with the little touch of soup! The tiramisu dessert was nice as well and for the price we paid, it was well worth it! The service was good and they attended to us promptly with water and also bread with olive oil and even asked if we want a top up too. I will definitely be back again if there is good promotions
4
Who knew there were that many kinds of mozzarella in the world! Very nice - loved the different mozzarella appetizers (especially the eggplant one. Had been looking forward to the fig and rocket one but it was disappointing). My main was not that great though - a very tasteless bucketful of risotto. The four stars I am giving this place rest entirely on the strength of the mozzarella appetizers. (And also maybe the chocolate lava cake).
4
Most of the seating is outside. It is very nice and you can watch people walking by. A friend walking by, saw us and stopped to visit. The food was good and the portions were very large. When we asked for side vegetables they served us plate of grilled vegetables at no charge. The only problem was it took over an hour to bring our main course, but since we had eaten our appetizer and were enjoying our wine and the lovely outdoors, it allowed us to enjoy the atmosphere and not be rushed. To be fair they usually do not make this type of mistake and apologized profusely. A nice relaxed atmosphere
2
We had the daily lunch set. The tomato soup was excellent! Fish was nicely done too. Risotto was a disappointment especially for an italian restaurant. It was overcooked and poorly presented. The tiramisu was excellent too. Overall the food was alright (except for the risotto), but the service was very poor. The waiter lacked enthusiasm and general friendliness. Overall staff seemed unmotivated to deliver pleasant experience to the guests. When we left the waiter was looking at his phone without even lifting his head to say goodbye. Probably not worth coming back
4
The food was really well cooked. Even though the pricing may be a little expensive, the portion of the food served was huge! Therefore, I would suggest couples or friends to order carefully because I had to resort in stuffing down the last few mouths of the wonderful Mac n Cheese
3
We had a nice meal at La Latteria. The mozzarella selection is nice. I just found the service extremely slow. We were there with kids and it took ages to get their pasta. They need to improve the service otherwise difficult to come back.
5
Nice place, very kind personnel, good food, good drinks.... Excellent and generous portions ( 1 starter and half main course are enough to enjoy without feeling too heavy)
2
There was a table that was very rowdy and noisy but the service staff did not ask them to keep the noise level down. Some diners were so upset that they went up to the table to ask them to lower the noise. Another diner told the staff that the other table was too loud but the staff did not do anything either. The noise was too deafening and spoilt our appetite to continue with the meal. We could barely hear each other across the table. The appetizer of Parma ham and mozzarella was good but pasta was only average. Try the al fresco dining if you really want to go there. Overall, probably not worth going back again.
3
Food was average, if you want a great Italian meal... this isn't it. The warm bread with balsamic was the highlight! I asked for olive oil and rock salt and was delivered a salt shaker. When asked to add chilli to my poorly cooked marinara, the waiter looked perplexed and said 'I'll see what I can do'. Marinara equivelant came out and the seafood was out of a packet with a real fishy smell. The cold meat and 'buffalo mozzarella' was served. The smallest amount of cheese, cut up into little tiny squares. Prosciutto was great! But the mortadella tasted like cheap Devon. Overall, not great bang for buck. Poor quality for the price. When I asked about the chef at the end of the meal, the reply from our waiter was 'of course he's not Italian, he's Malaysian'. Unfortunately, I knew that the minute our pasta came out.
5
I love this restaurant so much !!! It is one of the best meals I ever had... The mozzarella is at the level of a gastronomic Italian restaurant. The types of mozza are hard to describe due to the incredible savour... The pastas are excellent too... Best Italian restaurant in Singapore 
4
I confess that eating in Italy at least three weeks a year makes me demanding...Loved the locale, neighborhood and staff (even an Italian in there for good measure).Pasta dishes we had were all very good. Service crisp and helpful.Tasted my brother's buffala and was simply underwhelmed- not the real deal- but I am sure its quality product...it's hard to translate the flavors and tastes like that...so I salute the attempt, but wasnt blown away.Careful when the place gets crowded as the acoustics can make for disproportionate noise levels.Would return, recommend- and try other mozzarellas
4
Our visit to Latteria started inauspiciously.We arrived on a very cool evening (it had been raining like hell) and a truculent waiter (thankfully Latteria's only one it proved to be) refused to turn off the overhead fans above our outside table despite the protestations of several other tables.I suspect that sensing our irritation, one of the Italian managers came to our table himself and painstakingly explained the menu and specifically the various mozzarellas available.All the starters are one form or other of mozzarella so don't go here if you are lactose intolerant !! He also took time to understand our preferences and advised us well on the main courses available. We opted for the lamb shank which was one of the best I can recall.Service standards were excellent and the food was served on a timely but unhurried basis so we were able to enjoy a well paced meal with no pressure to hurry up to vacate the table......the place was sold out with several walk-ins being turned away.Overall it was an excellent experience and the staff were all friendly and knowledgeable........even our truculent friend was much more amenable by the end.We all have bad days I guess. My only complaints would be the wine list,too short and thoroughly average for a restaurant of this quality and there was not a vegetable in sight !! This venue is not somewhere to come regularly because frankly it is too limited and the theme will become weary quite fast but for an occasional splurge its good

I had been looking for a european style restaurant with outside dining for my sister's recent visit - we usually go to Graze as the food is always excellent and great terrace area. Decided to try the Latteria as friends had raved about the lamb shanks. We were not disappointed! 3 of the party had the lamb shank which they all really enjoyed - the portions are very generous - and meat just falls off the bone. I had the steak which was ok, nothing special. We shared a platter of cold meats and some mozarella to start - all very nice also. Outdoor terrace feels liek a little oasis, surrounded by the simple greenery

I visited Latteria Mozzarella during the restaurant week and the dinner was the best Restaurant week dinner I've ever had. Normally during this week the restaurants try to be sneaky and provide a 3 meal deal with extremely small portions but Latteria Mozzarella gave actually 4 courses and the portions were abundant! And the food was just delicious. The starter was the best including three Mozzarella balls in three different ways which was followed by a good mushroom gnocchi and ended up with either a pork or a halibut main. I had the fish which was soft and smooth. Finally the meal was ended with a desert (a nice peace of chocolate cake with ice cream and warm caramel sauce) and a choice of coffee or tea. As you see there was plenty of food and to ask 35 ++ for these 4 courses - to anyone living in Singapore - knows is ridiculously little!! On top of that, the service was excellent, very friendly and welcoming as well as attentive as we were give more of the home made delicious bread and our drinks were filled constantly as well as the waitresses even stopped over for a chat. I would recommend Latteria Mozzarella to my friends and cannot wait for the next restaurant week to see what they have come up with that time. I will also visit the restaurant soon again once my Mozzarella cravings get too unbearable
2
great location, great service but food..not so good. suggestion with starter special (very nice but very pricey! 3 out of 6 of us had one of the risotto which came in huge portion..but bad taste.. could only eat less than half our plate. Very surprised nobody who took our plate away asked if there was something wrong ...is there a new chef which could explain our disapointment ??? dessert was also uneatable.. obviously a few days ol

Truly Italian gem located at the top of the charming Duxton Hill. Amazing quality of food, generous portions, honest price and genuine Italian hospitality. Highly recommended.

I visited Latteria Mozzerella during Restaurant Week in Singapore and tried their 4-course $35++ menu. Assuming this is representative of their everyday menu... the meal was a major disappointment.Before getting to the food, the service at Latteria was excellent and made me feel like a valued guest despite how busy the place was. The ambiance is nice but it was too crowded / noisy and so that took away from a 5 star ranking.On the food, the first course was a serving of three types of Bocconcini cheese prepared in three different ways. This was excellent and a good start to the evening. I particularly liked the one that was fried with a tomato sauce to accompany. Unfortunately the remainder of the meal was not as good.- Gnocchi with Wild Mushroom Ragu: Disappointing - tasted closer to soggy mashed potatoes than true Italian gnocchi- Grilled Halibut with Potato: Lacking in flavour and the fish did not taste fresh (I also tried the other option, a type of pulled pork... somewhat inedible)- Torta al Cioccolato with Caramel Cream Sauce: The "chocolate muffin" was dry and the caramel sauce tasted diluted.The accompanying bread was nice, and served slightly warm, and the olive oil and balsamic were of good quality. Coffee is also good relative to most restaurants in Singapore.It may have been that the kitchen was overloaded due to Restaurant Week, it may be that they cut corners to maintain margins, but based on the food I ate, I can't recommend Latteria

Being from Naples, when it comes to mozzarella I am a pretty picky guy...I have to admit being on the other side of the world it's not easy to find a good quality Mozzarella, nevertheless La Latteria actually has a good quality product, surely the best one currently in Singapore.First tip, the restaurant owner is from Puglia so, you want to make sure the you chose the right type of product, in this case forget Mozzarella di Bufala (it's from Naples) and focus more on Nodini, Sfoglia with Prosciutto and Burrata. Personally I am a believer that Burrata is a product that has to be eaten on the same day it is made as it is an extremely fresh product but being in Singapore you have to be flexible so it will not be as 'liquid' as the one you will taste in Bari, it will rather be more compact.On the other hand the Nodini, fried mozzarellas and the Sfoglia are a must order on the menu, I suggest in general to avoid the usual pasta choice, simply because it's not their focus... Other than mozzarella, its advisable to order plates as Parmigiana di Melanzane or Peperonata or Bruschette (both bread and tomatoes are of good quality).For dessert Tiramisu is done pretty well.- Service is very good, Daniele is a very respected manager in Singapore, he knows how to deal with clients.- Atmosphere is also very good, also thanks to the fact a Mexican bar opened just in front of it and it is a 'happening place' in Singapore.To conclude I have been to la Latteria more than 10 times and I am very happy with it, no doubt in recommending it!PS Make sure you reserve seating at the terrace and you go on a Thursday (that's w

Cheese. Lots of delish cheese. Need I say more?But I will anyway. Come for dinner, sit outside under the strung lights. Great place for a date. Then head to the champagne bar 15 steps away next door and you're in for a great night in Duxton Hill.
5
Excellent location with a cooling breeze. The food was great, staff friendly and wine chilled.Portion sizes are generous so consider, for example, 2 starters for 3 people and share. Very relaxed with a good vibe for a quiet Monday evening ( all detoxing after F1 ).Pudding was superb. S

They seem to have a very nice terrace, but thanks to the weather or not, we could not enjoy it.The starters there are very nice.For the main course, i had the risotto, the portion is very generous. Most probably you will not be able to finish it. Personally i ate half. All the afternoon felt very heavy. Not sure if it was the way it was cooked, but it was not the lightest risotto i had eaten.Staff there is nic

We dined in during the last Singapore Restaurant week and man..we can't wait to come back for another homey, heartwarming servings of mozarella and risotto. The lambshank is a bomb! It's good for two people.Service: Attentive staffs, both local and Italian.Food: Nothing much to say as words are not enough to describe it. Dine in.Value: Quite pricey, but still satisfied as the food is topnotch.Atmosphere: Located in the hidden part of Duxton Hill. Be cautious when dining al fresco as the area near the bushes may have bugs. I got bitten by mosquitoes
5
The location and setting of this restaurant is impeccable, just as the attentive, competent service is. The menu is easy to navigate: mozzarella variations and usual italian delicacies, which i did not even look at.I knew i liked mozzarella, and a restaurant devoted to italian cheese dishes - what a treat! Accompanied with an Aperol Spritz and Italy feels just like round the corner

I've been in Singapore for some years now and have been to so many restaurants. There are only a few I'd say are really good. Latteria is one of those perfect restaurants -- authentically Italian and the food is made to perfection. I asked for a caprese salad (tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella) and a crabmeat pasta. Pasta was perfect and al-dente. I noticed the Italian owners are always attending to customers and are extremely resourceful and "simpaticos." Now the best detail: dessert is also perfect! We were a party of four who asked for 4 different desserts, all deliciously made. Wine selection is also very good. Atmosphere is pleasant, tastefully decorated without exaggerations. We'll definitely go back. Last time I had such good Italian meal was in a little hidden restaurant in Sorrento, away from the tourist crowd, which is what we always look for when spending holidays in Italy
5
First time here as my colleague said the mozzarella cheese dishes are amazing. We tried 2 dishes of mozzarella. One with crab and the other with pumpkin - very tasty! Portion is big, best to share. We had a main each. I had grilled seabass which is superb! My colleague has lamb shank where portion is huge and cooked just right!Price is reasonable for the quality & quantity you're getting. Service is fantastic. Only thing which I hope they can improve is the limited wine selection by the glass. The quality of wine by the glass is not good and serving per glass looks little too
4
Apart from the Delicious food they offer here, they have an amazing service and lovely outdoor dining area.
I am so coming back and recommend this place for anyone who ask for a good italian Restaurant in Singapore.
4
Lovely place, very satisfied with environment, food, wine & service. We had an enjoyable time at outdoor terrace with breeze. We ordered burrata cheese & calamari, both were beautiful. No complains for my overall experience.
4
I've eaten here twice and have left having had a great evening both times. The food is great, and if you're a cheese lover then you should really give it a go! Their signature Mac and Cheese is not really sold as well as it could be on the menu - it's baked inside a pumpkin and is served inside said pumpkin - delicious. Everything else I sampled was equally good. The service is attentive but not overbearing, great ambiance, good wine list and not ridiculously priced by Singapore standards! Highly recommended
4
Beautiful location, cosy vibe, charming service team all make for a very nice evening out. Great for cheese and a bit of pasta. Sit outside to avoid the reverberations from loud diners and be able to hold a conversation. The service is what makes this place exceptional
4
Kirby was serving us on a Sat brunch hour, he was helpful and attentive. Knows his menu well and was great at recommending. The mozarella cheese, seafood tomato sauce pasta and eggplant starter were great! The only downside was their truffle risotto. It was too big for 2 girls to finish and it wasn't good. That was the only item on our table left quite untouched
5
The place is in Duxton Hill, a very nice and quite area close to Chinatown. They have tables both inside and outside. I went there with my wife after about one year we moved to Singapore from Roma. We had very simple food: bufala with cherry tomatoes, nodini with ham and half jag of pinot grigio. We were amazed by the fact that everything had just exactly the same taste you can appreciate in Italy. Prices are also reasonable.Highly, highly recommended

The resto has an extensive mozzarella selection. We particularly liked the treccia (braided mozzarella) with fig sauce on rucola leaves. We ordered another one with anchovy sauce but it was just so-so. I wish they had other kinds of cheese.Hubby ordered lamb shank and we were SHOCKED with the size! Two large, 5 inch portions in a medium sized baking dish! I wish the waiter told us how big it was going to be, so that we could have just ordered this dish alone. It cost SGD 30 which was a very good deal!I ordered the grilled cuttlefish, served with fresh cherry tomatoes and rucola, with a wedge of lemon. So refreshing.Servings here are quite big. Even the mozza appetizers were huge. We hardly couldn't finish what we ordered.Wish the waiters and waitresses were more attentive by telling us how big the servings are so that we can order more prudently. After all, we arrived at 630 am and we were the only ones there; waiters were just chatting among themselves.They have a good outdoor area for al fresco dining. A lot of people were surprisingly there, despite the humid weather...No space for dessert, so we didn't get to try it at all

I recently visited this restaurant on account of the extensive mozzarella I had heard they offered. We went straight for the burrata and sadly this did not hit the mark. I think we were handed a spoon but there was little point, nothing flowed when we cut through the shell, this was pure mozzarella which tasted good but it was obviously not what we wanted. The risotto was enormous and was a bit bland so not the best there either.The other dishes were great, the wine delectable, the staff extremely attentive, the setting almost tranquil (as far as that is possible in Singapore!)So not a disaster but not a restaurant I will be returning to unfortunately
5
Excellent food and service, coupled with a lively atmosphere. Plenty of food and wine choices. If you are craving Italian cuisine, wine and you love mozzarella, this is an excellent evening out with friends. This is by far the best Italian I have found in Singapore. In Singapore, its the little things that separate excellent restaurants from the rest. Latteria has the trifecta of service, food and atmosphere (recommend dining on the patio).Recommend sharing a nice bottle of one of the chiantis and starting with the buratta mozzarella on the bed of roasted sweet peppers and basil - amazing
4
Went as part of restaurant week, which was incredible value for the calibre of food we got. The restaurant week prix fixe was $25 for Parma-wrapped mozzarella, choice of mains (I ordered the lamb shank which was HUGE, very tender and delicious), and poached pear with mascarpone, coffee/ tea. We supplemented with an order of burratini and Mac and cheese. Both were standouts and, interestingly, accented with pumpkin which sweetness nicely balanced the cheese and other savory flavours. All in, a great meal. Service was effortful, perhaps not as polished as could be (when I did not finish my dessert my waiter was quite insistent on asking why), but no complaints from me. Decor is cute, loved the retro tiles, lovely space in a converted shophouse on a cute tree-lined street. I will definitely go back
5
It is one of the best Italian restaurant. Nice and simple and always great service. Quite impressive to find such fresh mozzarella so far from Italy. Great pasta as well.
4
Great restaurant located in the favorite part of town. Menu is excellent and the mozzarella is delicious. If you love truffle mushroom risotto, this the place to go, followed by lava chocolate cake. They have a great outside area for the evening.
4
I loved the terrasse and the location, great "simple" food, good service. I would appreciate more vegies to go with the mozza as it is a bit fat.
4
I didn't pay so can't comment on food pricing but the venue (we were outside), the service, the food and wine were all very good.WIne as in all places in Singapore was ridiculously expensive compared to home (Australia), Bangkok etc.My hosts had eaten here many times and chose the antipasti to start. Very generous and great variety although given the restaurant's name, mozeralla, be it buffala, buffatini, straciatelli or some other variation was involved in most bits.Followed up with a spaghetti seafood napoletana which was very tasty.Coffee was not great but OK
5
I have eaten at this restaurant 5 times over the past few months and have now introduced all my friends. The best thing about coming as a group is that we can order more dishes to try everything! The service and ambiance on the terrace is perfect for an evening with good friends. The risottos are the best I have had in Singapore, the porchini and truffle is my favourite on the menu but last night we had the red wine and beef cheeks special and I'm now I'm torn which one I prefer! The lamb shanks are always tender and meaty. All of the mozerrellas are amazing, the burrata is so creamy and seasoned perfectly with the sweet peppers. I recommend to get a mozerrella for starters to share between two and then a main each- the portions are more than generous, but that along with the charming host are what always cumulates into a great night! Please make sure you book in advance for a weekend evening as its always full.
5
This Mozzarella bar set in Duxton Hill has an outside and inside area and the food and service is great. There are different variations of Mozzarella as well as main dishes. Can really recomend the the truffle mushroom risotto (but you have to share it!) as well as try as many different mozzarella variations as you can. Will be back there soon

Latteria is in the beautiful Duxton Hill area which is all shuttered heritage shop houses and the restaurant itself is in one of these beautiful buildings, which gives a lovely ambience. The food itself is top notch rustic and authentic Italian. The selection of Mozzarella and Burratas is a great way to start off the meal, they have a wonderful fresh flavour, served with quality olive oil, prosciutto, mushrooms or fresh Mediterranean tasting tomatoes. The Eggplant Parmagiano is another standout appetiser, creamy and fully flavoured, one cannot help going back for extra helpings!For the main courses, they have a selection of classic but very well cooked pasta dishes, fresh fish (the Sea Bream is excellent) and the Tuscan steak is also delicious and virtually the same as you would find in Tuscany. The food is also reasonably priced so you will not coming away feeling you have paid through the nose as is so often the case in Sinagpore.While this place is not 'fine dining' like Oso, I think it is the most authentic Italian food in town, we felt it was very much like the food we had in Italy, with exceptionally high quality ingredients and as such, it is highly recommended

For more reviews and pictures, visit my blog! Ms-SkinnyfatThis 90-seater semi-alfresco restaurant has taken over the now-defunct Britsh gastropub The Jackson Plan, and the menu revolves around 11 variations of fresh mozzarella, each served with a contrasting side ($20-30). These creamy and milky bundles of joy are imported twice weekly from Italy.Frankly, a mozzarella bar sounds kinda intimidating even for a cheese lover like i am but there are non raw dairy dishes available as well. Our couple friend invited us along for their Restaurant Week booking. For $35, we had a 4 course meal from their actual menu. Here is what we ate.Our starter of Crab & Stracciatella Cheese Salad with Roasted Zucchini ($20). I love the shredded rags of cow's milk mozzarella and fresh cream. It is delightfully rich but not too heavy. The crab meat lent a light and fresh seafood sweetness to the mix and i love the juicy roasted zucchinis at the base of the tower. The red wine balsamic reduction lifted the dish with the slightly bitter sweet acidity. Nicely done.Next up, the Smoked Scamorza & Porcini Mushrooms Risotto ($25). Smoked Scamorza has a more dominant in taste than the mozzarella and i like how its natural saltiness flavored the risotto cream broth. I would say this is more of a wet risotto but it's nicely executed nonetheless. Would be a good dish to share.I was surprised at the size of the Grilled Beef Sirloin Steak Tagliata with Rucola & Truffle Sauce ($35). This is a full size steak, grilled simply and served on rockets. The steak was tender and done medium rare like we like it. Love the truffle sauce too. I could hardly finish my dishes.For desserts, it was the Lemon Panna Cotta with Balsamic Strawberries ($15). The pudding is slightly more curdled and firm but i love the thick milky smooth texture which is perfumed by the refreshing lemon. This is a match made in heaven. (No picture because the lighting is pretty bad and i think using the flash is rude.)Enjoy their 3 course weekday set lunch at only $28++. You don't have to wait till Restaurant Week to do that

A cosmopolitan location, open-minded and so italian, on typical Duxton Hill, in Singaporian Chinatown. A luxurious and large terrace, an amicable italian owner, a refreshing and young atmosphere. We enjoyed a great Barbera wine, very affordable, and worked hard on delicious and huge lamb shanks (we could not finish them, and took them away in a "doggy bag" (but guess what, we have no dogs!).A pleasant late evening

Great Restaurant We visited as part of a Singapore wide restaurant promotion - with fixed price and fixed Menu I had heard about the restaurant but never visited before . The owner met us when we arrived , and discussed possibilities of the Menu , since we had a special veg meal request . He was very friendly and welcoming . Every service staff was very friendly and happy to serve you The quality and taste of food was perfect . Started with a String Mozzarella Cheese Salad and followed by Risotto and Pasta . The meal was sufficient and rather filling . They included coffee on the meal menu and a dessert. The management should take another look at the interiors of the indoor seating part of the restaurant , it looks very nice , well decorated . BUT the trouble is that whole room is built with hard materials and hence the place just reverberates with the sound. They may add some curtains or carpets to dampen the sound a bit . The experience was marred by some other uncouth and inconsiderate guests on our adjacent table , who were extremely loud in conversation , and had 2 ladies on the table who were blessed with a very high pitched laughter , which just went off every 3 to 5 mins . Believe me ..... the last 5 or 10 mins , i had fingers in my ears. I would not blame the management for the behavior of some of the guests ...... but even so it took away the pleasure from the evening
