Indian curry house is closer to my office. We happened to know about their set lunch on weekdays.
Set lunch is totally worth the price and food was pretty good as well. They offer complementary buttermilk with set lunch.
Worth a try.

We ordered chole and kulche from indian curry house. Food was hot and delivered before specified time however, Chole didn't taste fresh and was full of masala.

Indian Curry House is situated right in the middle of expo and serves delicious north indian food. It has an elaborate menu and bollywood songs just make for the right mood.

We have been to this restaurant quite a few times. Tried both vegetarian and non veg food. Food quality and taste is good here.
Service is average not bad but don't expect too much.

I have been ordering delivery directly from them on almost a weekly basis for over a year. The dinner is always consistently amazing. In addition to my order they always send me some free treats - like a free soda and a free gulob jamun. Very very sweet of them. I usually order their amazing Mutton Briyani and Prawn Vindaloo as well as some naan and raita. If you set up the candles, flowers and music at home, all you need for a beautiful dinner is freshly made piping hot Indian food delivered to your door. Never dined in. Minimum order is $40 and they accept NETs (at the door), if you let them know on the phone that you will pay by NETs. The delivery man is always punctual and respectful. Food keeps well for a few days after if you need to reheat and eat

Indian Curry House in Situated at Singapore Expo and is famous for tasty and quality Indian food. You can seat inside the restaurant to enjoy food in AC or sit outside to enjoy food in fresh air. I had been a regular visitor to the restaurant during my Singapore stay. They play Indian songs on TV which was another reason of my visit to the restaurant.

I visited Expo last evening and was more than happy to see an Indian restaurant there. It was very crowded. I guess it was the only fine dining Indian restaurant around. Concept - You need to queue up at the counter to order food, pay upfront and then food comes later. So ordering is a no hassle.Food - Food is good by Singapore standards. I ordered Dal makhani, kadhai paneer, naan and mango lassi. It was served hot and fresh and within 20 minutes of placing the order. Portion was decent. Mango lassi was good too.Service - This is where the problem lies. At a busy restaurant on a Saturday evening, there were just 2 waiters serving the food. The table that we sat on needed clearing of dishes that were leftover by the previous customers. It was not cleared up, despite telling them 3-4 times. Even when the food came, the waiter cleared up only a section. You definitely do not want to eat food with dirty dishes lying around. The waiters were actually doing their job well. But the issue is that there need to be more waiters serving an extremely busy restaurant.Conclusion - Indian curry house is definitely a popular joint at Singapore. Go there for the food but do not have any expectations regarding the service

I ate here with 3 other colleagues during Gastech Expo 2015. The place was jam packed, so the service were a bit slow plus they couldn't clean the empty table at an instance. However the meal were delicious and worth the price. This is not a cheap eat though, for this it is better to walk to the Mall next to the MRT station. They have a food court there with good selection and lower price

Indian Curry House is located in Expo and with the umpteenth number of exhibitions in the location, the place is a blessing for a lot of people who crave for Indian food.The food is very tasty and good and is served very efficiently. However watch out, if there is a huge crowd, then it becomes quite a wait for your first order to come in. But you will have no qualms on anything that you order. It is a perfect location for non Indians who want to go and try Indian food and "get hooked on to it".The prices are very reasonable and the service is good.Surely recommend to visit this plac

on Sunday late evening we went for Dinner after visiting Expo.Megatex. All other food outlets at 10:30pm was closed except the Indian Curry House.. It was good to see that it was open so late at that place.. The Food was served very quick, Hot Tasty... Normally outside India rather Kolkata the Mutton Keema had a particular smell but we did not experience the same that made us felt at home taste. All the dishes are tasty and of good quantity.. One minus point is the Kulfi it needs little more attention in the tast
