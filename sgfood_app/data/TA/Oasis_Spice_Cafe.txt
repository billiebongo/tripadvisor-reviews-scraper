Aesthetically laid out in an egyptian theme the restaurant offers typical indian menu amongst others. The way they handle clients may need some refinement. wait for coffee could be a bit irritating

They serve Biryani and paratha and chole / veg as a standard menu... the taste may not be great but in a palce where you dont have many options for veg food this is a boon

If you like indian foods,this is the place. But little bit crowded place. Good value for money. It is near the mummy ride.

We came for food here as we were visiting universal studio rides. This place provides good Rice and vegetarian food with Paratha and Chhole with great taste. Children get plain rice with vegetables. Overall good for all pure vegetarian eating people.

This place serves predominantly Indian food (not sure what is the Egyptian food tag for). And a lot of people prefer this given the good taste. The staff serving were also very hard working and helpful but clearly the management wants to make the most out of those poor staff making them work to their limits. They have an extra counter but keep them closed even though they only need to keep them open till lunch rush.I waited almost 45 minutes to get my food which is not why i spent money on Universal entry tickets.When i complained to the person at the cash counter about the second counters being closed, he started lecturing me on the number of staff and amount of money needed to open the other counter. Listen guys you are inside a premier theme park and should focus on making your customers happy instead of trying to save money at the cost of making your customers spend so much time at the counters. Charge a little extra if you need to but don't make people waste their time standing in the queues

Located in Universal Studios Singapore, Oasis Spice cafe is a cute little Egyptian cafe that had about 6 or so menu items. Only 1 vegetarian option which I ordered...but somehow ended up with mutton so I traded my husband the mutton for one of his sides. Everything tasted amazing. The price was not too much. Overall, decemt experienc

While in the universal studios this Oasis spice located opposite to Ancient Egypt was just an average restaurant serving Indian food. But it was good value for money. Much crowded.

This place is huge, has decent Indian food with quick service. However like so many places inside Universal Studios, its a tad expensive. I paid $15 for a meal which you can easily get for $8 outside Universal. Since you aren't allowed to carry food inside Universal, we don't really have much choice

We had lunch here in the middle of our Universal Studios tour. Vegetarians options are not plenty - the Indian vegetarian biryani was one but it did not look very appealing (plus we had by then seen the same dish at all tourist attraction restaurants like the zoo, jurong bird park, and were saturated with it). We decided to switch to the other option - baba ganoush and pita bread. The quantity was limited, the pita bread was not soft and warm but crisp and cold. The taste was good though. We also picked up strawberry and mango slushes which turned out to be excellent, especially given the hot and humid weather outside

Oasis is a great place to eat while in Universal Studios. It is located right in front of the Egyptian Mummy check point. The aura and the arrangement gives you a feel of being at the iconic cafe of Singapore
