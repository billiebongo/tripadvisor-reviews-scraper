For those local who are familiar with Serangoon famous Chomp Chomp food centre, this is the equivalent in the Bedok area. You will get all your usual supper favourites such as satay, fried chicken wings, oysters, etc. You will not be disappointed.

A good place for late night food. Very inexpensive with a great variety to chose from. Only downside is the lack of halal food, but otherwise a eaters delight. Finding parking or a seat/table can be a chore, but to the patient, all will be rewarded with your meal

The Fengshan Food Centre in Bedok is one of my favourites in Singapore. It is very local, very good food and very good value. My staples there are the bbq seafood stalls that do great 'stingray', sambal kang kong, and sotong. The satay stalls are good too, but that's just scratching the surface. I'd recommend any tourist to take a trip out to Bedok for this

Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our "go to" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality and don't be afraid to try any one of the places that didn't have any such advertisements or a line because you'll find good food everywhere in Singapore.Char Kway Teow is one such awesome dish and is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the "Wok Hei" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours at the one I tried at Block 85 North Fried Oyster stall is balanced very well and the Wok Hei was more prominent than most hawkers, it was beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.We also always order their Oluak aka Oyster Omelette which has a mix of just cooked oysters in a omelette with garlic and chives which is dipped in chilli sauce. Although I do enjoy the version of Oluak here, there is a place that does it with an extremely crispy finish, that's hard to go past. We never miss ordering it though, as I'm a sucker for a good Oluak and it goes great with the Kway Teow.Wings and satay and the like are usually really hard to find a bad example of. The seafood stall that serves skate up from the Bak Chor Mee stalls is really good too.It may take a little time to fine a seat at the Bedok Block 85 North complex where the food hall is situated but there is plenty to choose from whilst there and it's worth the wait. The chicken wings from the store next door are good, as is the two stalls around the corner that sit side by side to each other that serve Bak Chor Mee aka pork noodles. Just check out my other posts at Bedok Block 85 North for more information on the food available in the same complex.Overall I think the quality of food at the Fengshan Market and Food Centre is awesome and would recommend it to anyone.Cheers!Dave
