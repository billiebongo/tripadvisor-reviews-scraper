Conveniently located, this branch of Kick Cafe serves both local and espresso-based coffees as well as teas. Good place for lunch and meeting location during off-peak hours.

Good food and coffee at a great value. The sambal of the Nasi lemak is fantastic. Asked for second helping. Masala tea and honey lemon.... thumbs up!

Managed to grab a quick lunch and ordered the nasi lemak. A bit pricey but the drumstick was really huge so worth the price. Quick and friendly service.
