Found this place last night. Our first night after dinner. I found their craft beers. I loved the Archipelago IPA. So much so that I returned again this evening. Even the bar lady remembered my Fife’s choice of wine and my IPA from last night

Rather authentic Thai cuisine. Food was great but portion is small especially for vege. The tomyam soup is really yummy but pork abit too tough. Overall it’s worth a try!
5
Folks Collective – a Thai fusion restaurant in the middle of CBD at China Square Central, selling Thai food at affordable prices, along with impeccable décor seems a straight formula for success.
5
Very good service with wonderful food and ambience. The chsf's carving skills were impressive too! :)
4
i liked the food here and will be somewhere id return to despite to innumerable options in CBD. thai food done well and affordably priced too
5
Really love eating there. Ambience is good and Thai food is authentic. Went with friends on weekday evening and we are all satisfied with the taste

Came here for lunch this week with a friend. First time I've eaten here, although I've walked past it many times. The food was quite ok and the prices not too bad. There was a special deal on Tiger beer: 2 for $10, but it was lunchtime so we behaved
4
Folks Collective serves up good Thai food at a price that is reasonable for the CBD folks. I just had lunch here earlier today and ordered one of their lunch sets which had the Thai green curry and lemongrass grilled chicken in it. The portion is more than ample for me and the food comes served in a nice platter. The chicken was flavourful and tender and I especially liked the chilli on the side - just perfectly fiery to whet my appetite. Service-wise, I found the lady who took my order and brought food to my table quite friendly and pleasant. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a decent Thai grub in the area

We came here with a reservation for a weekday lunch. The waiting time was correct, but the menu needs updating, they don't do the high protein rice anymore. The waitress did not inform me when I was placing my order that my request for more vegetables would incur additional charges until it was brought to the table. When I told her it wasn't fair on the diner to not be informed before the decision was made and I certainly wouldn't agree to paying extra so she could send it back to the kitchen if she wanted to, she left the veggies very grudgingly and we were made to feel uncomfortably embarrassed for the rest of the meal.The food was OK, we have no complains but it was nothing exceptional.It's just not a pleasant overall experience. As diners, why should we be made to feel like cheapskates, especially when we weren't fully informed before ordering? It'd be a restaurant I wouldn't mind revisiting again as the deco is interesting, if it wasn't for that experience with that wait staff. Now I'm simply too scared and uncomfortable to go back. I don't need my meal to be served with a side of judgement
4
The soft shell crab mango salad was really good! (Paired well with the Green Thai Ice Tea.) The rest of the food was decent - although on the sweeter side for my taste. The setting was very cozy - certainly transporting us to Thailand for the evening.
5
Revisited the Folks Collective this trip...back for thai food, some nice drinks and a great dessert. Service is always good and its a great option for a quick business lunch.
5
Great experience there. The ambience and food was awesome. Price was reasonable too. Probably about $20-$30 per pax
4
The decor of the restaurant is very nice. Thai food is not that pricey for a restaurant in the cbd location ! Wish the serving portion was bigger though. service was great.
1
Ordered the $10.90 lunch set. Food was bland and unremarkable, laughable. Ignored by service staff about five times. Charges 50 cents for a cup of water that's the size of a child's hand. Food was loaded with MSG, so much that my face felt numb. Will never be coming back
3
The staffs were friendly. However, we had a hard time communicating, just to order our meal. It was frustrating. I.e. one of the staff couldn't understand our drinks order and I even have to write it down for her. Then our drinks weren't entirely here for a while, and I had to go and ask for it, just to receive a wrong drink due to miscommunication. Although they immediately prepared the right one after explaining a few times.The food is nice, but the drinks could be better. At the end, our bill was wrongly counted and we had to clarify with the staff again, but they solved it asap.May not visit any time soon, but might come back just for the happy hour promotion

Thai restaurant, very cozy, BUT the food... not much more in the jar except a "kind" of curry with 3 small pieces of tofu that had been fried several times,terrible taste; The varied dish was all fried "things" and the oil dropped out, terrible taste; The pineapple rice was dry and not at all to eat, I suspect that it was even already a few days old and always warmed up! terrible taste;We also ordered "flat noodles" and got glass noodles!Even though we had indicated 'everything' on the menu with our finger as the waitress did not understand a word of english!The only thing that was nice and correct was the diet coke!When cleaning the table the waitress have seen that we have left everything but nothing was asked! We asked the bill, payed and went away to definitely never go back!What a difference with six months ago!This is typically a restaurant that certainly "does not" give people something positive to remember!We where eating there already a few times, but this time, the day after we had the day stomach discomfor
1
Four of us came here for dinner after work and we ordered quite a few dishes and drinks. The food didn't taste bad but the steamed fish recommended by the staff there was not properly cooked. Surely enough at least 3 out of 4 of us had diarrhea the following day.Certainly not a great experience
1
Not even mentioning the strange taste of the pineapple fried rice and fried dory fish, just thinking about the long waiting time for the set dish of more than 20 mins is already turning off all my appetite.... especially upset is when u found out all the food is so disappointing, not worth the time n money, will nv come agai
4
We ordered many of their signature dishes and though there were not many people ordering, the food took a while to come. Lucky for us, we were enjoying a lazy Sunday lunch so we were in no rush. We saw later that the kitchen was only manned by 1 chef so maybe that's why. The food is actually not bad, some were even very good. The not-bad ones were:1) Cashew Nut Chicken - a tad spicy and served over a basket of yam!2) Grilled Pork Collar - not much taste on it's own but the accompanying dip was too sour for my liking3) Okra - normal nice4) Pad Thai Seafood - texture ok but a tad too sweet for my likingThe good dishes were: 1) Basil Stir-fried Pork - I didn't have any as my eldest girl ate them all and did a when I exclaimed "no more for me?!"2) Crispy Fish Skin - super crispy and laced with salted egg = Yumz3) Olive Rice - nicely fried and fully flavour, another favourite of my eldest girl4) Pandan Chicken - good marination so the meat was tasty and nicely fragranced with pandan5) Prawn Cake - not the factory made ones, you can tell from the bits of prawn in the patty. Was the right kind of crunch6) Red Curry with Roast Duck - this is an interesting dish with mild lychee sweetness and red curry spiciness in a good combo! 7) Soft Shell Crab Salad - didn't see much of the salad but the crispy soft shell crab made up for the dish8) Tom Yam Potaek - not a big bowl but the ingredients were fresh and the soup not overly spicy that it'll kill your tastebuds. 9) Street Omelette with minced Pork - fluffy egg fried with minced pork and onion strips! Let's just say the kids ate through the first one so fast that we had to order another
4
Cobblestone pathways and a plethora of restaurants with open air dinning hidden away in an aisle off the CBD. The restaurant it self serves authentic Thai Vietnamese fusion food ( amazing array of Hors d'oeuvres) served by a couple of friendly Thai hostesses - very authentic. Definite drink stop with friends
5
Recommend sundry pork, fiscakes, and chicken in pandang leaves. Goes well with Tiger Beer and a nice evening chat!
5
This outlet is meant primarily for the office crowd.
Came here with a couple of colleagues during our lunch hour.
Do try the set meals, which is made up of 3 dishes served "tingkat" style. They arrive within 10 minutes and are really great value-for-money.
4
This is a Thai restaurant, very cozy, very tasty, not spicy if you ask, service done with great love, quickly and correctly.We where eating there already a few times and the girls already recognize us, even some of our favorite dishes!This is definitely a restaurant where you can go to "for any occasion"
2
Having eaten at FC at China Square Branch and Asia Square, this outlet at FE Square is not value for money. 2 of us had the set (fried chicken drumlets) and added order of green curry and beef in basil and the order came out to $51 for what is blend thai food which i can get far better at hawker s center in Amoy Street.If you are from Thailand, you might find this place the thai restaurant yih would never want to visit when in Singapore as the food is 'school canteen' quality i would rather go back to China square outlet !
3
This restaurant serves very decent Thai food, and the set lunch in particular is quite value for money. If you're around the area, this place is perfect for business lunch. However, they charge for tap water, and in a very small metal cup no less... Oh well, would have been "Very Good" otherwise
4
This is one of the Thai restaurants that is located near my office so my colleagues and I go on a regular basis. The set lunch usually starts around S$9.90 onwards which is quite reasonable. Went again for dinner and drinks after work tonight and the bill came up to about S$140 for all the dishes as per the photographs plus 2 beer, 1 cocktail, 1 glass of Shiraz and 1 glass of Thai milk tea
4
I couldn't quite understand the facade and interior design of Folks Collective. Plenty of Grace Kelly photos on one wall, and double-seater chairs European in design. A menu that includes both curry and Thai tom yam gung. I thought the interior looks confused, although refreshing and interesting. However, after ordering one set of Thai favorites and tasting the lemongrass soup, pineapple fried rice and fried spring rolls, the design does not really matter. The food is all that matters.The tom yam tastes truly good. So was the fried rice with pork floss. Quick service. Waiter often asked if everything was alright, even offering some Thai desserts at the end of the meal.Confusing design or not, this place is worth coming back to.
4
Visited the folks collective at AXA tower. Regularly my colleagues and I are here for our team lunches. Set A and Set B would be the favourites to order. $9.90 per set, and drinks are not included. Friendly staff and at most times wait about 10mins for seats.
3
Restaurant has a great look, warm and inviting. Pleasant ambiance and the staff are friendly. Ordered a couple of dishes from their tablet menus, food was quite average in taste and presentation. Was expecting more flavor. Came for lunch, however looks like a great place to hang out in the evening. Maybe give it another shot in the evening.
3
Came here for a few beers after work this week. Prices aren't really that cheap - you're actually better off to visit the place opposite (Cocotto) where the beers are considerably better value for money. That said, it's usually easier to get a table at Folks Collective
4
Nice ambience and good Thai green curry preparations,m. Liked the idea of ordering from the tablet on each table and then pay on your way out!
5
Had lunch (came in an incredibly adorable tiffin carrier) and food was fabulous! Very fresh and well prepared. Only criticism would be the temperature (barely warm) of the food- probably due to mass plating during lunch hour.
3
We went with friends, for thai. Good ambience and decent food. But hardly any options for vegetarians. imagine going for thai and not even tasting a green or red curry, very sad. As the curry paste itself was non-veg
1
Wondered why this cool looking restaurant was empty when the less-interesting-looking place across the walk was busy. Now we know :-(
1
Terrible service! 15 of us hd lunch here and 2 didn't get the food they ordered after waiting for 1 whole hour and asking multiple times. Wasted our lunch break at this place. Do not waste your lunch time here.
3
This is a Thai casual eating place. Not so much for sharing but great one plate wonders. If one was vegetarian, one would be able to eat here quite happily. However I didn't like the food. Had the salted egg squid - bowl of rice was separate and squid so-so. All the food reminded me of the Zhi-char / freshly prepared food at the food court. And if that was the case, why come here when there is cheaper food just a stone throw away
1
My colleagues and I were at the outlet during lunch hour today and we were served by a new staff. I have nothing against new staffs but we noted that firstly, she misrepresented to us when we asked her on the vegetarian option of some dishes and she also refused us when we requested to be served at the same time. This is honestly the first establishment I have been to, that insists on bringing out their customers food, one at a time (at long intervals too). It is completely unfathomable.Secondly, because the waitress who was new, was mistaken in telling us the dish was vegetarian when it wasn't, we changed our orders. However, the item that we cancelled was not removed from the bill. Alas, we only noticed it after the card was charged. The cashier refused to omit the item or reissue a new receipt. I find this unacceptable as whenever this has happened to me, the proprietor would cancel the transaction and reissue a new one. I think when we pay a service tax of 7% (which isn't exactly cheap), we expect, well, service. In a nutshell, utterly disappointing
4
I hosted a business lunch at Folks Collective recently and enjoyed it. The food was perfect for me and was tuned to suit the various palates. We experienced professional and friendly service with none of the issues recorded elsewhere, and the fitout and ambience was nice and quite funky. It's probably expensive for Singapore so the any service issues need to be resolved, but I'd definitely eat here again and would also explore some of the other restaurants in this colourful little area
2
Have been here 3 times now and each time it has disappointed. I gave them the benefit of the doubt after the first 2 times (when they were newly opened) but they have have not improved one bit. Shame since their food is actually quite nice....They run the ordering via an Ipad, apparently for efficiency. But they cannot distinguish between a starter, main and dessert. Last time we went, the desserts arrived first and then they were shocked we 'didnt want them' (this is despite ordering on their ipad for 'later' rather than 'immediate' delivery)Mains are staggered, with several in our group of 4 receiving their meals some 20mins after the others and starters arriving somewhere towards the end of the meal. Not a good experience at all...
3
This is definitely not your run of the mill thai restaurant, and it comes with a bar! Not a bad concept by far. We drank a few drinks at Happy Hour prices, waitress extended the hours for us too! Very nice of her :)For food, we had the following:Pork collar - tasted ok, can't quite tell it's char-grilled. But the chilli that came with it was power! Spicy and brought the pork to a new level! Pad Mama - my fav of all dishes! Very tasty and salty, but maybe you have to eat with the sugar on the side. We didn't so the noodles turned out to be too salty. But still we finished up every strand :)Sea bass with soy and ginger - a little pricey, but fish came in quite big portion, and was soft and tender. 2-3 pax can share this dish for sure. Overall not bad, and the fact that the place was not overly packed made it a plus to come back to

I went to Chinatown in Singapore an I found thousand of restaurant around this place,and rain was come so I have my lunch Sweet & Sour Chicken with rice and my friend have a set of Chicken curry,Fried Egg and Rice it was yummi and
4
Visited with a Friend during Singapore lunch hours and wasn't disappointed. Quite a buzzing place with self: ordering facility on ipad (tied to each table). Good hearty meal for 20 SGD pp. Thai green curry was great. Will come again!

Was at Folks Collective in Asia Square for lunch on a weekday. We were early enough that we got a table immediately, it gets full really fast. The set lunches look reasonably priced but the lack of vegetarian options had us ordering a la carte.We got the Petit Vegetable Appetisers (Sweet Potato Fries, Crisp Tofu, Spring Rolls, Samosas), Pad Thai, Collective Folks Rice, and Iced Thai Milk Tea. The sweet potato fries were delicious with the Sriracha Mayo. The Pad Thai with Tofu was fair too, the rice though was insipid. The food on the whole was decent. It's a pity though that none of the typical Thai curries can be made vegetarian by them. The service, though friendly, was inconsistent. (They first got us the meat sampler starters instead of the veggie ones. The Pad Thai was first brought without eggs.) On the whole, it's a decent place, but definitely not worth the price for the portions (mains) and general food taste and flavour
3
This is an average bar that serves average food at a very good price. We had lovely service and none of the issues experienced by other reviewers.Take it at face value please - its not trying to be anything smart just a basic bar with a plentiful choice of food that works well for a group
1
I have been here a few times, the decor is really cool, a comprehensive Thai menu and the prices are reasonable. However the last two times I have visited the food has been below par. Today I went with three friends, and three of us ordered larb gai. I frequently eat Thai food and I enjoy chilli, a lot of chilli! However the larb was so spicy it was completely inedible and so we did not eat it, and instead sucked ice cubes for the rest of the meal to ease our burns. As a reward for not being able to eat lunch we received a 10% discount on the total bill and were told to ask for "not spicy" next time. I resent being told I can't handle my spice, because I can handle spice, I am spice! I can't handle a larb gai where the gai is substituted with spice. If you encounter a similar issue I recommend you get some coconut ice-cream from the place opposite instead of paying 50 cents for a cup of dirty water. boom

We stumbled across this area whilst walking around. There were so many places to choose from Japanese, Korean, Italian, Chinese, Thai and more, as well as fast food locations. We decided to seek out a busy place and Folks Collective seemed to be one of the busiest.The cuisine is Thai or Thai-inspired. The dÃ©cor and ambience are good. The food was quite OK, nothing special, but it was served promptly, possibly too promptly as we not planning on a quick lunch
3
Visited the Folks Collective in Telok Ayer for a late dinner on a Friday evening. The food was alright however the staff was not very receptive. Would say it may be because it was nearing the end of their shift, nonetheless they should have been more attentive.Decor is nice with pleasant ambient lighting and various Thai-inspired trinkets.Food arrived and was OK. Bit bland and lacking in flavour, for the price, we would have expected a little more
4
I visited this restaurant many times it's now my favourite Thai restaurant in Singapore. The food is perfect I would definitively recommend the vegetables, the mango salad and the pad see ew. The service is fast and the staff in extremely friendly and nice. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor tables
5
Situated in a street with a giant umbrella above to protect from the tropical rainstorms. This was a delightful place that we found for a late lunch. The seats are on the pavement outside of the restaurant allowing for some people watching while waiting for the food to be served. First we were served with some ice cold mineral water in little silver tumblers. My lady had sweet and sour chicken with boiled rice. I had a Thai green chicken curry with a crispy omelette and boiled rice. The food was delicious and there was plenty for two hungry travellers. I would recommend this place to others
3
Authentic tapioca and red rubies. Coconut ice-cream is home made but so so only. We like the brownie with vanilla ice-cream with Thai tea sauce. Brownie is moist and chewy, nice! Service from a particular waitress was bad. She didn't understand our orders which was simple. Had to repeat 2 times and reconfirmed with another waitress.
4
Very nice Thai food but could have bigger servings. The decor was really nice very chic. The staff were friendly and responsive and their drink cups were awesome. I had so much fun eating at this establishment and highly recommend it to anyone.
1
Avoid this place like the plague, it's cheap and nasty, the staff can't take orders, can't deliver orders in the order you want them and the food is terrible, really appaling place, horrible atmosphere and appalling service, if I could mark it minus I would.
5
Love the food and the price of this restaurant. I am a regular customer and hope that they open more stores and expand.
4
Good food served in a nice way offering great lunch menu selections. Service was great and very well trained. Food came fast as it needs to be during lunch time and it was delicious.
2
Had business lunch with a group of 11 at the Folks Collective Asia Square branch. We were seated on the second table near the door. Apart from the constant wind from the A/C constantly blowing on your face coming somewhere from the direction of the door, there was also A/C water dripping on your drink/food from the ceiling. Needless to say it was a crappy experience and not worth the $20 average per person that we spent
2
Visited the folks collective today!! Out plan was to celebrate a friends birthday ... We booked a table for 10.1. The table given was for 6 and two additional table were joined - the size and height was off. Very poor seating.2. We placed the ordered via the I pad - the good came in random order. Post the drinks, part of the main course arrived! They skipped the soup totally. After 15 mins of the main course the rice finally arrived !!! We ended up eating the dishes as snacks as there was no rice and drank the soup of the red curry and free curry .... We had to cancel the soup order and the hostess was very upset. Subsequently after we finished the meal the veggies arrived !!!! Shocking service. We had to cancel that as well !! We had finished lunch. 3. The only credit I will give this restaurant is that they did not charge us for the soup and veggies because we cancelled the same! In terms of the taste - overall the food is average. The black pepper beef is very good and the lychee red curry is good
4
Came to try the set lunch and it is so reasonably priced at $9.90. There are 4 sets to choose from and we chose the Set A that comprised of seafood tom yum soup, chicken and rice. Another set we had was Set D which comes with papaya salad, grilled chicken (din realised we had 2 chicken dishes) and choice of sticky rice or normal rice. Food was good though portion is not too big. Will come back and try their dinner nex
3
I have been coming here quite a lot lately and I have seen the quality of the food and the service slide rapidly downhill.The problem appears to be that the eating area is big (and gets crammed with more and more tables on every visit) and the kitchen remains small and hence food delivery is slow.You get tired of asking where your foods is. Its all very well having hi tech tablet computer ordering when you get stone age service!Twenty five minutes yesterday for Phad Thai - and when it came- its normally nice but the prawns tasted old and the noodles were rubbery and tasteless.I am unimpressed with the set meal- yes its cheap but its pretty grim. the a la carte wasn't bad but like I said its slippin
5
Came here several times for the lunch set but also in the evening! Absolutely love the green curry, the pad Thai and the chicken with cashew nuts. Amazing! Love the setting, not typically Thai deco, and the nice atmosphere in the evening when sitting outside. Highly recommend!
3
i was told it is normally quite good but this visit was a disaster. Brought my meal before the appetizer and long before my host's meal. We had to ask three times for her meal. Post meal they dropped plates that splattered on us and nearly did a second time. Slow, slow, slow. Portions small. Food average. I will avoid next trip
1
This is the worst ever eating place i came across in singapore. I ordered for vegetarian olive fried rice (they have specifically mentioned vegetarian menu) and after waiting for 45 min, they served olive rice with chicken. Not only this, when i complained the staff doesnt give a damn and asked if i want to cancel my order or not. I doubt how this resto is surviving without having basic hospitality. Please avoid this place if you dont need any disappointment.
5
We went for lunch, set menu was about $10 per person, so cheap and cheerful. After a slight mix up over a vegetarian choice, the food that arrived was exceptional.The two types of chicken wings we tried were amazing, no sad tacky sweet chilli sauce in sight, just really good home made style chilli sauce.Main courses were great, good flavours, fresh ingredients and served fast.It now my favourite lunch in Singapore
5
Folk's Collective is one of our fav hang outs during lunch time..for great Thai food. The place is always brimming with people and it is advisable to reach early. There is scope for service to improve but that is understandable as the crowd just keeps overflowing. A must visit if you are near Chinatown in Singapore
3
Yes it s truly Thai with all waitress n dishes a Thai as can be. We had the Tom yam n fried chicken (2 pieces set) with additional side dish of kai lan n som tam. Service is efficient but don t expect any more other than fast food style n taste. Ambience is crazy fusion of Thai with western retro poster of '50 ft women' movies of 60s era and some antique scooter motorbike. Very popular lunch crowd but not the place to impress your biz client after price for food is not too cheap or too pricey. Yes, my Thai friend brought me here so it must have passed the Thai s expectations
3
This sits between 3 and 4 stars for me but it got a 3 as service was patchy. Food very good - excellent Tom Yum soup, Phad Thai and green curry, chicken satay was just ok. Deserts are excellent. Service could be better - just a bit amateur - had to ask for cutlery, small bowls. Ordered 2 jugs of beer, then we had to ask 3 times for the second to be served. Location just off China square with lots of other bars around. Great for after work dinner as right near the office. We would go back
5
Great Food, Great Location which is relatively near offices and nearby hotels. The ambiance is really unique as well as choice of furniture. I recommend you get the Lunch Set from 11-3 which comes in cute Tiffin carriers, I always go for the tom yum soup, chicken wings and jasmine rice. Their chicken Pad Thai is really delightful and their sauce is awesome, I dont know what they call it. Thai Lemon Ice Tea is also good. i think i have been there close to 6 times with different friends, service is always good and fast. Must Try! -Ashle
5
First time I've given a 5 star rating for a restaurant. Even more surprising, this is for a Thai restaurant in S'pore. 99% of Thai restaurant here doesn't serve genuine Thai food, even the expensive restaurants. But the food here excites even the Thais here. The decor is brilliant, atmosphere is fantastic (luv the music), service is good. Highly recommended!
4
I have been here several times and brought two friends here lately for a mini dinner gathering.The food is somewhat localized Thai style food. We ordered green curry, steamed sea bass, folks wings, mango salad, fish cake and a few desserts. For those who want their dishes more spicy could tell the staff so, especially for the mango salad.The dishes were tasty and served up pretty quickly. Serving portion is about right but not too big. Although done in local style, the taste is authentic Thai. We loved the red ruby with ice cream. The tapioca dessert should be shared as it is a fairly large serving. Very nice too.Happy hour beer comes one for one and other promotional serving that is not really good value. It would be really expensive without happy hour promotion.The place is cosy although seats are mostly stools. Table could be a little too small. On the whole the diners are good crowd, very energetic and talkative. So this is a good place for friends gathering and chill out.I would definitely go back again for the good food and friendly service
4
This is a real find, a fantastic Thai restaurant in China Square which serves wonderful food with a good selection of vegetarian and meat/fish dishes and some lovely wines too. They could do with some more staff but that's Singpaore all over.The food selection was fantastic, well cooked and very delicious. Highly recommended
2
I was here with a colleague for lunch and ordered 2 set lunches from the menu. As with some restaurants in Singapore we ordered using the tablet on the table so we were expecting the meals to arrive pretty quickly. While my meal came relatively quickly my colleague had to wait for close to 40 minutes and I was about to finish my meal before his came! The food itself was average but the portions were good. It was very hard to catch the staff's attention and we got quite frustrated having to wait so long. Maybe it was the busy lunch hour period but we saw other tables get their food relatively quickly. It is a shame but this experience makes me a bit hesitant to return to Folks Collective
