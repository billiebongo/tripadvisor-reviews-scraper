Simply the best popcorn in Singapore. Although pricing might be slightly steep, however it is worth every penny. Thumbs up!

Love it and can't get enough of it. The macadamia is my go to choice.

Get the Chicago Mix, if not munching on just one flavour migt be a little much. It helps to alternate sweet and salty.
Pricey popcorn but every piece is crunchy, so it is worth the money.

Delicious popcorn and a must pop by place for me everytime i go Singapore. Good as food souvenirs and the packaging makes it easy to bring on the plane and not get damaged.

Specialty for popcorn snack. For this visit we tried the buttery, the almond caramel, and the mix. The almond caramel was new to me and it was very delicious. Be prepared for queueing the line but it is worth it.

For the win! You would not find this signature popcorn provider elsewhere :-) I even had to stack my luggage with packs of this. the cheapest is SGD 9 and the most expensive is around SGD 18

I was quite surprised to see such a huge queue in front of a random popcorn store at 9.30 in the evening. I stood in the line because my son wanted to have some and I got a small bag of "Chicago Mix". God was it good! The caramel popcorn was the best and the crunchiest I have ever had.They have different sizes of bags and tins to serve the different flavors they offer: plain, buttery, caramel, dark chocolate etc. This is so worth a try! I am already thinking of going back

If you visit singapore, be sure that you buy this meal. Garrett popcorn is a popcorn outlet that provides several popcorn with unique taste. Its location is in Vivo mall at Harbourfront. The one that i love is caramel popcorn. It is very sweet and the caramel topping has made the popcorn more crunchy. You will find the another side of a popcorn here

Specially the chicago mix, mix between cheese and caramel.
prepare to queue in line, but it is worth it

Always a must buy and must eat whenever I'm in Singapore. The smell is enough to make your tummy growl in an instant. I love the macadamia, butter and caramel combo.

For me looking for popcorn so i have to find Garrett. The taste? Oh my God, really good, i don't want to share mine with others sounds so strange but it is describing how i love GarrettPrice? If it is converted to IDR will be EXPENSIVE but it is fair with the taste of its originality.But they don't have any store in Indonesia. I only can enjoy it when visiting Singapore... How's bad!!!Garrett please open Here in Indonesia!!!!

If you like Popcorn then Garrett's is definitely a must visit for you ! ..we stumbled onto this gem at Somerset 313 Shopping mall and are now on our way to purchasing two jumbo bags to bring home. What a taste sensation ! You absolutely must try the Chicago mix of sweet and savoury ! It's pretty busy but the staff are very efficient and friendly and happy to give you a sample if you ask

I walked passed this place quite a few few times in past few months and manage to NOT stop by. Last night my good will break a part again. Smell was sooo nice. Chat with the staff quite a bit and she recommended me to try the macadamia caramel one. Oh.. It was even more yummy than the normal caramel by adding macadamia in. 1 small bag = ~ 3.5 cups = 1,120 kcal and cost 9S$.I finished it all off within 20 mins which made my daily calories pumps up triple.. worth it :) See you again next few months. I need to get more exercise after this small bag.

I don't normally eat popcorn unless at a movie. However, once I tried this, I find that it is good. Just got to make sure it is fresh and not soggy cos been sitting in the bin too long.There are a few variety like caramel, with cheese, regular or plain popcorn or the Chicago mix. I usually buy one cheese and one caramel. However, these days I prefer the Chicago mix...a mixture.Quite reasonable as one small one costs $5, medium size $8 and large about $11 so it is reasonable.Good as a gift as well.There are stalls in Wisma Atria, 313 etc

I am not really a pop corn lover but this one is really good. I had tried the caramel crisp which is $5 for small pack. Its good enough for me. I had also tried the ones that comes with nuts like almond and cashew which will be more expensive. They have several outlets in Singapore and the one I went is in Great World City and 313 (Somerset
