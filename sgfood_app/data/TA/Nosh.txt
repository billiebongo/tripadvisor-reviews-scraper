I liked the food and prices. We sat on the upper deck area with cooling fans and it was very nice and breezy. Service was ok, waiter made good recommendations. Cocktails were nice.
1
Having the noisy bar music during the brunch hour... The service is very rude. This is the first time I encounter the service as bad as this!
5
Cosy place for lunch, with outdoor space open for dinner. Food and coffee is great. Small space. Can get a little crowded at lunch so it is good to make reservations for big groups.
4
It's a good and quiet place for catch-ups. The food on dinner menu was so delicate and delicious. Will return for brunch menu!

This beautiful and intimate alfresco restaurant takes your breath away with the fairy lights, cosy ambience and wonderful food. Fell in love with this place back in early 2016 and I knew I had to hold my wedding there. Food never failed to amaze us - they refresh their menu seasonally and the service is consistently top-notch. Special mention to Teaz for his wonderful and stellar hospitality every single time we are there and to Amanda, whom was our wonderful wedding coordinator. Nosh will always have a special place in our hearts

We were really impressed by the extensive menu and options included in it! When we saw the list originally, we thought that those were choices to make, but ALL of them came! That was nice and a great way to celebrate Xmas with our family. Only concern was the reliability of Chope to secure our reservation. Staff in the restaurant were very nice and find us a table but we were lucky for a date like this, when some other places do not care for the customer. Kudos for Nosh

The atmosphere was awesome with the fairy lights and alfresco dining concept. However, paying $65 per pax to get a plate of mixed grill which came lukewarm with sides of salad and a pie to share among three was really bad. The portion was really very very bad.Plus point for nosh was only the service and atmosphere.

The restaurant was located at one of the black and white colonial bungalow, some walking distance from the MRT station. For lunch, only Noshery was opened with a limited lunch menu, which consisted mostly of sandwiches, rice bowls and desserts. Although it was a hot day, the place was quite cooling and relaxing with all the greenery around. Iced water was served after order was placed.Smoked Brisket Sandwich (S$15++)Polka Bread, House Smoked Brisket, Chipotle Aioli, Onion Jam, and GherkinAlmost didn’t order the sandwich as I thought that the bread would be rather hard. Turned it was alright with crusty powdery crust and chewy soft inside. The sandwich filling was tangy with hints of spicy.Lavender Honey Roll (S$7++)Lime Fromage Blanc, Roasted Pineapple, Yogurt Sorbet It looked like a slice of swiss roll, served with a scoop of ice cream with some crumbles. The roasted pineapple tasted strongly of alcohol, which peaked up the plain icy roll. The sorbet tasted more ice cream with its milky texture.Homemade Ginger Beer (S$4++)The drink was served with a wedge of lime, and tasted refreshing.Do take note the restaurant will be closing at the end of this year
4
The food was very good and the service impeccable. i liked the location - a colonial bungalow - very much and the weather was also cooperating, providing a breeze through the deck where we were seated. A nice place to be for a leisurely weekend brunch and certainly would return again
1
The staff is very unfriendly, snobbish. They look down to customers. If you don’t dress like someone working in an investment bank, they don’t serve you, ignore you. When you tell the manager, this is not nice, he’s like I don’t care, and feel free to tell others on these sites, we don’t care about individual customers. This is horrible! Btw, it’s smelly and has mosquitoes
4
The staff were very attentive and the setting beautiful. Thought just maybe the coffee could be a little warmer.
5
Quaint, relaxing atmosphere amongst lush greenery and pleasant setting. Not to mention yummy and unpretentious brunch selections!
5
Amanda did a great job in getting everything perfect for the beautiful celebration. Food was fantastic and atmosphere was romantic. Thank you team!
4
Crabcake benedict is delicious! Their scrambled eggs in Devil's Breakfast was excellent too. However, my iced chocolate was pretty bland. We also waited for around 25-30min for our dishes to be served.
5
Good food, great service. Food was well prepared as well as drinks. Nice place to take photo for instagram

Second time visiting. Food was excellent as usual. It was my friends birthday and the alfresco atmosphere was beautiful with the lovely lights. Staff were friendly but tried multiple times to clear our plates when we weren't done with it yet. Weather was chilly after a downpour and steps leading up to eating areas were slightly slippery.Very sad that they are closing soon :
4
We ordered: 1) Burrata caprese, 2) Pan seared scallops, 3) Pork rack with truffle fries. The burrata was excellent! The scallops were seared to the right degree. The pork was tender albeit dry but was tasty. Overall, the ambience completed the experience. It was chill, relaxing and cooling though we were seated outdoors. Head there now before it closes down!
4
The place is pretty and the food is good. It feels like you are away from the hustle and bustle of city. Service level is dependent on which service staff is attending to you - some good, some perhaps less so. Finding a parking lot in the immediate vicinity could be a challenge due to the very limited availability
5
It's interesting how much more tasty the food can be with the personal touch. Teaz, the maître d'hôtel, and his team definitely went the extra mile at our anniversary dinner. From the non-intrusive attentiveness of the wait staff throughout dinner to quietly having the pasty chef decorate the dessert plates with a simple yet elegantly written "Happy Anniversary" (in chocolate),the staff should be complimented for doing all this without fanfare or showiness - just a quaint bistro dinner for a couple to enjoy each other's company. This was not my first visit, but I'm still very pleased with the consistency of the food. The star of the evening was definitely the Moroccan lamb, which is charred perfectly and literally melts off the bone. This is definitely a dish to nosh on. We came in with high expectations and left looking forward to our next visit
1
Did a booking. Got a missed call but didn't manage to pick. Didn't return call as I thought is random marketing call. Caller didn't bother to return call. Booking got cancelled only found out upon reaching venue.
5
Food and service were good, topped up with a nice ambience. Some mosquitoes around but it's inevitable given the outdoor setting
4
tucked away in a secluded spot amongst lush greenery, this is a nice brunch spot for the perfect chill weekend
5
What impressed me the most was that they served a complimentary dessert which we could choose. There was also a words "happy anniversary" printed on it, an extra touch that made it special!
I would recommend this place for romantic dates/anniversaries and so on.
5
I had a really wonderful brunch with my son, the service was great, the ambiance was very chill and relaxed, the food was fantastic and even the music was wonderful. We will definitely go back again to try out some of the other food there.
5
well spaced dining area with sufficient privacy. food was awesome and even though dining was alfresco, there were sufficient ventilation and air conditioning to ensure a good environment! complimentary birthday cake was also provided which was a delightful surprise!
4
Worth praising is the crabmeat benedict! Lovely ambience set colonial bungalow which is relaxing for weekend brunch.
5
Nice ambience. Instagramable food and place. A place for couples, friends and family. Good service staffs.
5
Nosh is definitely a place to host your wedding and make your event a memorable one. The even coordinator at Nosh, whose name is Amanda, did a great job in managing all our request from decor to food preparations to their excellent service. Her team were on form and also met every guess expectations. He team mate T.S was a key person who also had everything under control and was very detailed in his service too. Me and my wife still can't believe that we actually hosted such beautiful wedding at this wonderful fairy tale venue. Thank you Amanad, T.S and the entire Nosh team.Regards,Vi
5
Me and my family (2 kids - 4 yr and 10 months old) dined at Nosh tonight and had a great overall experience. The service was attentive - never had an empty glass. The food was divine. The only exceptions are the following two items: (which may well be personal taste).1. The starter salad had a lot of frisée salad and not a lot of other leaf types 2. The a mouse bouchée (which is very hard to please everyone at the table) I wish was explained what it was all about. Why/what does the Chef want me to experience here?? This context was missing. After these two starter flops (in my opinion) everything else was grand - the morocco lamb was diving, the Poke was excellent and the portobello risotto (I am a picky risotto guy) was out of this world. So good we had dessert- which also was fantastic. We will be back :
5
Held our rustic-themed wedding at NOSH on 15 July 2017. It was a lovely experience working with the NOSH team. Especially Amanda, the events coordinator who we could tell had ample experience with weddings at the venue. She went out of her way to accommodate our requests and worked tirelessly on the event day to ensure that everything went spotlessly. The banquet manager, Teaz was also adept had handling our large guest list and took it upon himself to go round each table, making sure that the food was to the guests' liking. Also kudos to the serving staff and chefs at NOSH; we received many compliments on the quality of the service and lingering tastes of what was served that night. Thank you for making our wedding a memorable one! Sincerely, Esmond & Ashley
5
Very nice ambience with indoor and outdoor seats. The service provided was good and attentive. Definitely will revisit the place again.
4
Great place with great atmosphere. However, food portion for some dishes are not value for money. Friendly staff with attentive service.
4
Great food, Nice Environment to gather around with friends. Staffs are really friendly. just a little too expensive.
4
First time at Nosh and was pleasantly surprised. The gardens setting and the small wooden hut - v welcoming. The breakfast selection was good and had a rustic presentation and taste which fitted the theme. Good job!
4
Good ambiance. nice food with big portion of food. Variety option and the ondeh - ondeh cake is so good.
4
We went for dinner one Wednesday andmust say that the place was really nice.
Excellent food at decent price and friendly service.
We will certainly come back
5
Great simple food well prepared and delicious, outstanding and amazing service, super nice people indeed. The Atmosphere is excellent for a relaxing lazy Sunday. Very warm and inviting. We will be back for sure.
4
The atmosphere and ambience was perfect for couples. It was quiet and the lighting was warm and inviting. Service was prompt and responsive too. Food wise, the risotto was really good and the finger potatoes, which was a simple side dish, tasted impeccable.
4
The service from the staff was good as well as the ambience. Taste of the food was interesting but the pricing is on the steep side - portion of food is small so if you looking to filled your empty stomach may either go to the other restaurant down the road
5
We were privileged to be invited by friends to join them for dinner at Nosh. We loved everything about it - the location, the friendly and fun staff and of course the food. We found every dish to be top quality and loved the complex flavours. Just delicious. Thank you
5
My husband and I had a date night dinner at Nosh the night before we got married. The menu was unexpectedly small and simple but food was amazing. Service and the ambiance was great too. Perfect for a dinner date. Two thumbs up!
4
Great place to chill over coffee and brunch with friends or family. Great outdoor atmosphere and could see this as a perfect place to host events as well.
5
What a beautiful restaurant! Perfect for the hot, humid Singapore evenings. Gorgeous yet simple, with lights and flowers and extremely green surroundings. Delicious food and outstanding service for really affordable prices. Really a hidden gem.
5
Had crab and eggs Benedict, was excellent! Also great coffee and service! Was raining so the staff kindly accommodated by changing to indoor dining.. will definitely come again :)
5
Cozy, food good and amazing service!
I brought my brother there and he liked it a lot. It's my second visit and definitely not my last. Cozy, food good and amazing service!
5
The face towels were served upon us entering for 5mins. Waiter was very cheerful and fast service. Food was nice too! Definitely going back!

With a rustic theme in mind, my partner and myself have chosen Nosh restaurant to hold our solemnisation and dinner party. Our experience with their planning and service team was very much a pleasant journey. Nosh has been very understanding and accommodating to us for postponing our solemnisation date when my partner is down with chicken pox. Trust me, we were very relieved that the dinner could be postpone without major additional cost. We would like to thank Amanda (event coordinator) for all the help and suggestions that she had provided us. She is approachable and is always prompt with her replies, answering our queries and requests. We would also like to thank Mark (manager) and his service team for the day. They were very professional in executing their roles and many of our guest sang praises about the whole process from solemnisation to the transition of the dinner. And not to forget, praises for the food (5 course meal) too! Without you guys, the event would not have been possible. Once again, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts
3
Service wasn't as expected, we went to Noshery and mentioned we looking for Noshery cafe to dine in. Was directed to Nosh instead. Was our first time thus just follow their instructions. Seated and realized the menu was totally different, decided to give a try and realized the food wasn't to our expectations as a food lover. However the ambience and overall service level were up to standard. Thanks.
4
We held our annual closing ceremony for the CrossFit Open at Nosh this year, with over 38 guests lined up on the deck. Food was stellar and the view was breathtaking. We had the three course set, which started with a burrata caprese over a parmesan crumble - portions were a little small for our big CrossFit appetites but was impressed at the manager's versatility & kindness in accommodating us despite turning up with a larger party than we RSVPed for. They even managed to split our bills individually across 38 credit card - not an easy feat.Would go back just for the food alone, but equally thankful for service. Thank you, Nosh
5
 I've heard from friends and read reviews of their food. They were all good and so I thought of trying it out with my friends. Nosh did not disappoint. The food was delicious, we loved the decor and I'm so happy that the price was reasonable. I assumed it would be pricey because brunches are getting more expensive. Thanks Nosh for keeping your prices reasonable!
5
Loved the rustic set up with the colonial bungalow. Food was good, especially the biscuits, pancakes and crab benedict!
5
Nice ambience
Nice food
Nice beer and wine
We chose the outdoor seats and yes it was romantic and well decorated
3
the ambience here was really nice and we could understand why people hold weddings here. food was rather average though
5
We sat at the al freso area and because it was outdoors, the server brought cold face towel for us to keep us refreshed. Not only that, they were very very attentive to our needs! Food was great and I'll definitely be back again.
4
My friends and i had brunch at Nosh on Sunday. Although the place was a little packed, food were served warm and prompt.
4
The atmosphere was very nice as the place is surrounded by trees. So, good for relax and closer to nature after hectic working days
5
Impeccably attentive service to make sure everything was good, food was on point and the best part was the spacious and lovely ambience surrounded by greeneries
5
Great food, requests were made promptly, really love the call on the day itself to confirm the reservation.
5
The set menu for V Day was interesting. Some of the stuff was pretty experimental and not that great. But the stuff that went well was amazing. Particularly the mains (roast duck breast) and the dessert (while chocolate truffle parfait); they were intelligent, delicious and unique. The location itself was perfect, secluded away in Rochester park. For a moment we could feel as though we were away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Price is definitely expensive, so I wouldn't recommend regular visits. But it's great for special occasions.
4
Visited this place last month for brunch. Loved that they will serve you infused drink immediately once you are seated. Had the Mac & Cheese which was just okay with a good price. Tried their other dishes as well which my friends ordered, can't remember the names of the dish however they tasted great.We sat outdoor with the greenery and I am most impressed in how they keep the mosquitoes away from such kind of place as we did not even found one mosquito bothering us throughout the meal. Overall it's a beautiful place for a brunch on any day
3
On a weekday lunch time, we were the only table! Sooo quiet! Hmm..food look really good, but taste was just so-so. I will say, feast for the eyes. Maybe the place will come alive at night time?
4
Attentive service and good portions. Thanks Nosh! Staff showed me to the waiting area as I was a little early, very attentive and all smiles. Was recommended to share their butter biscuits along with a main and it's a favourite dish that day.
5
Great food and service, but their coffee was rather burnt. Beautiful interior, though it was a lot smaller in space than I expected. They have a big outdoor sheltered terrace, but it was too warm to be dining al fresco.
4
Place wasn't very crowded but do choose to sit indoors. Apart from the aircon, the deco indoor is much nicer as well. The service staff is good and is a much more conducive place to have a conversation.
3
Overall dining atmosphere was relatively good. However food & service were pretty much average, no wow factor.
5
One of the best dining experiences everBuratta Caprese as appetiser and Pork Rack for main course - they dont sound at all innovative but they were made with prime ingredients and perfect combination of taste and arrangement. Dining was outdoors in a serene location - large retractable roof in case of rain; large mobile coolers in case of excessive heat.The staff were excellent - thoroughly enjoyable experience and good value in this expensive cit
3
Was sadly very disappointed in the vibe of the restauarant... The terrace , although spacious, lacks any kind of vibe and needs updating/ a little love. The food choice is quite limited for a brunch menu - they don't have brunch staples either like avocado or mushrooms when ordering a 'make your own'.
4
Oh what a quaint delight Nosh's baby bistro, Noshery, is in Rochester Park. Got to love the Liberty-esque Mandalay tropical palm wallpaper and rarified ye old library antiquated nooks both in and outdoors. 4 stars for the decor and ambience but lunch was frankly worth only 3.5 :( The fish and chips were a tad soggy and the duck confit pasta, too 'gamey'. A nice hideout to catch a quick lunch or nurse a coffee and cake on a balmy afternoon nonetheless.
4
The cafe has a nice outdoor setting with good comfort as there are air coolers along the sides of the shed area. I tried the weekend brunch of crab cake Benedict and it was great. The lemongrass mojito was a little below my expectation as there was not much of lemongrass taste in it although it was still refreshing. Service was great and we had a very relaxing brunch on Saturday late morning till past 1pm
4
Overall lovely experience! Some of the staff still a bit new and learning, however willing! Really nice setting (we sat down stairs, in inside at the long table) for a chilled Saturday late morning. Coffees are good. Both the Nosh Burger and Devil's breakfast were really yummy. Good portion and brew-dog Dead Pony went well with the burger. Overall great experience and will be back in the evening so sit upstairs
4
Food was awesome! Nice place to chill. Romantic place to bring your partner too. Restaurant will provide mosquitos repellent.
5
Beautiful rustic venue set in lush greenery. Brunch is one of the best i had. Service staff was just amazing. Very attentive and friendly. Definitely a place to visit for meals!
5
Service and food was excellent. Appetizers portion was small though. Environment was really beautiful in the night, but a little warm.
4
Good brunch. Excellent outside sitting area. Relaxing atmosphere. Very good coffee and friendly staff , will return.
5
Nosh, The food menu is limited however the quality of the food on offer is first class and more than compensates for any initial concern re choices. The restaurant ambience is good with nice soft music playing unobtrusively in the background. The staff are very attentive but importantly not overbearing. Mixing/swapping items within the menu i.e. lamb for beef was not a problem.The wine list however had a number of shortages on my last visit and the eventual selection was well overpriced for the quality of the wine served
4
Really nice ambience. Very good service. Smiles are always spotted on the staffs. Beef steak is a must to have. Risotto was good too! Was there for my partner's bday celebration and cake requested was on the house! That was really sweet of Nosh! Menu selection can be wider though but overall it was a good experience and dinner! Definitely will be back again!

Location +: nice restaurant away from the busy city -: not much buzz around the area Ambience +: beautiful outdoor deck that seems like it would make a great space for events or weddings. kept cool with awnings and the greenery around and fans. Didn't get bitten by mosquitos or feel sticky at all. Parisian style chairs, warm fairy lights, not too crowded. Very romantic feeling. -: while the ambience was fancy, the type of crowd it attracted was quite casual and local. Nothing wrong with that but it loses the "posh" potential it could have. The service staff also lacked a certain flare - it didn't feel like they had much experience waiting in a nice restaurant. Food +: had the crab cakes, short ribs and tartare. Everything tasted good, crab cakes were fresh. They did try to throw in some fusion into the menu, for example the crab cakes came with some sort of coconut curry purÃ©e and the beef tartare was infused with pickled garlic - kind of Korean style. -: the food came a little bit too quickly so it made it feel like a quick in out type of place. menu selection was very limited. So was the drinks menu. Wish they had more alcohol options so the place could double up as a after work drinks place. Portion sizes were very small for the price they charge. Service +: attentive and friendly. -: again, the ambience is fancy but the service staff may need to be trained to have more flare. When I was still nibbling on my food a waitress came and cleared the plates away. OverallEnjoyed the night, the food and the ambience, but the place is a little rough around the edges for it to be a perfect location. After the meal I didn't feel a pull factor to stay a bit longer to have a drink or two - which is a shame because the place was lovely. We left to go somewhere else. If they could improve on their marketing to attract a sophisticated crowd, polish up their service staff, add more drinks to their alcohol menu, I think it would make the place a little bit more sexy.
4
Was there for friend's wedding reception. Place is nicely located, tucked within greeneries. Food is overall good. Crabcake & flank steak were great. Steak was done rare to liking. Duck confit Gnocchi was good too, though slightly salty to my taste. Overall presentation of the food were also enticing
4
Was there for brunch & we had crab benedict, devils breakfast & flat white. Overall, food was good, excellent service. Price was a bit on the high side for us esp for the devils breakfast tho I like this more than the crab benedict (as it is a bit strong taste). Would like to try their dinner next time
4
Place was nice as I remembered from previous visit . But forgot that It's all outdoor seating , so it was very hot even though the staff were very helpful in angling fans to our direction . Can't help wishing they had told me when I made rsvn., though , as I had indicated request for indoor seating 
5
Their menu does not have a really wide varieties of food and thats what makes them special. They really focus on the few dishes they have and make it really good .
5
We had a great time to relax and enjoy the cool Breeze. The braised short beef ribs is soft and flavourful.
5
Very nice setting, super friendly service, delicious food. We come here regularly and never have been disappointed..
5
Good food, service and ambience. Would recommend this for a date. Especially enjoyed the crab cake and the beef short ribs.
5
Fantastic service with excellent food. Great place to have a nice dinner at! Would definitely go again!
4
Good food good ambience staffs there are awesome. Nothing else can compare. Although they serve the wrong food but still they change for us without us noticing
4
I was there on a weekday evening, 3/4 packed, outdoor concept with music playing in the background. didn't have to wait too long for the food to come, great service from the staff and really nice and affordable food. the grilled salmon was soft and the skin was crispy. crab cake is a must to have! I was there for my birthday and the staff presented me with a complimentary cake. what a lovely experience
4
I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Nosh, being american fusion, but the food was pleasantly delicious and not excessive. It was also well presented and the service was pretty good, which Singapore is not always well known for. It was a lovely outdoor setting, though as usual the table had a wobble. I would definitely recommend
5
This place was simply amazing. I had reserved a table for 2 on a Wednesday night for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. There were only al fresco dining but it was pretty cooling and windy for a Singapore weather that evening (although for the men, if you come in long sleeved shirts and tend to perspire very easily, I suggest you wear something more cooling). The ambience was really nice with the right kind of soft lounge music playing in the background and the servers tending to you swiftly and the manager constantly doing his rounds to check on the customers.The food were all delicious too. We ordered the Maryland crab cake and sweet corn soup to share between us for some starters. We had not expected the crab cake to be entirely made out of crab meat so when we tasted it, we were both pleasantly surprised. The red coconut curry dip compliments the crab meat so well I wished they gave more! The sweet corn soup also fared well - sweet and thick with nice bits of corn in the soup too. I ordered the Blackened Sea Bass and the boyfriend had the Flank Steak. Both were really good in their own unique ways. The fish was not too dry but had just the right texture to it and it paired well with the couscous too. The steak was also very tasty, cooked to the doneness as requested by my boyfriend. The mash was really nice too!The only small disappointment was that they did not notice that I had indicated for a chocolate lava cake for a special birthday surprise but only served their toffee date cake, which was still nice although a little too sweet for the both of us. Nevertheless, I'm thankful for the cake they had prepared! It was a great experience on the whole and I would definitely go there again in the future
4
Brought my boyfriend here for a special birthday brunch on a Saturday. Made a reservation but it wasn't crowded when we got there. There didn't seem to be parking around so we parked at the mall across the road. The restaurant was a short walk over. The menu was limited but the food was really delicious. Great service by the staff who gave my boyfriend a complimentary birthday cake ! Good to visit if in the area
3
Visited with colleagues for a business dinner. The food was great; good presentation and great flavours. However, the service was slow and very poor. The waiter took forever to take the orders and would return to re-ask. Finally the cocktails ordered where less than ideal.
4
Had THE most beautiful wedding celebration there, ambience was amazing, food filled everyone's stomach and best of all, we chose the right place to celebrate the most important day of our lives and we're glad we did.
5
Very good food, well prepared and original. The place is really nice and there is a very good ambiance. Service was very pleasant.
4
Good food and drinks but very expensive for what you get. I'd opt for the other restaurants in Rochester Park next time (Bistro, UNA, North Border).

I was awarded a Family Recognition voucher from SAF and exchanged it for a brunch for 2 at Nosh.We went on a Saturday morning at around 11.50am and managed to get a free parking lot in front of the restaurant. We had to climb a flight of stairs to get to the brunch area, which was a little inconvenient for me as I was carrying a pram.The ambience at Nosh is great! I really love the old English furniture and the fact that there is nature all around. We found a seat closer to the entrance which surprisingly was the empitier side.As part of the gift package, we were able to choose 1 starter, 1 main and 1 dessert each. We both had mushroom soup, and I had the dory fish taco while my wife had eggs benedict. The mushroom soup had a tinge of truffle oil which was above average and my wife enjoyed her eggs benedict. I thought my fish taco had a soft texture with good sauces and I would go back for it. As for desserts, I didn't really enjoy the cheesecake because of the raspberry spread all around.The staff at Nosh, though few, were alert and friendly. they were quick to refill our glasses and sported a smile whenever they approached any of the customers. Even the Malay waiter who had probably just had an exceedingly long day visiting the day before for Hari Raya Puasa was all smiles and active as ever. The manager even escorted my wife to the ladies which was at the adjacent building.The only problems with this kind of outdoor dining (only for brunch) is the humidity and the heat even in the late morning. My baby and I were perspiring quite badly but the staff were quick to tilt the air coolers in our direction. Despite the heat, my baby was able to fall asleep, attesting to the serenity and calmness of the venue.This time, I might have just spent just $10 for the sparkling water and claimed a $97 meal, but I'd surely be back for more another time.See you again Nosh

The ambiance here is hard to compare to anywhere else I've been in Singapore. Walking up the steps leads you to a beautiful alfresco deck that is warm and inviting. It is the perfect place for small groups of friends or couples to turn to if the focus of the night is conversation and catching up. The menu is quite condensed and between 4 of us, we tried quite a few dishes. Our table's favourites were the Garlic Gnocchi, Maryland Crab Cake, Beef Short Rib and Grilled Pork Chop. The flavours on each dish were great and each dish was well executed. Service was a little shaky but generally was still pleasant. If you are looking for a place to dine away from shopping malls or the other (often hectic) dining strips, this is the place for you
1
I have to admit that it started off well, the appetisers were fantastic and we were super excited to receive the main - a gorgeous looking chicken breast. The problem was that it was raw in the middle, i am not talking slightly raw i am talking completely raw in the middle.The best apology that the manager could come up with was to not charge me for it, I was very disappointe
3
The ambience, like many/most of the Rochester Park f&b places, is really nice, relaxed, green, uncrowded, and generally very pleasant. The food is good - not exceptional, but good and about at the right price point. It's mostly 21st century western, all the favourites you'd expect. The wine list is short but well thought through, tho the whites aren't chilled enough and there was no dessert wine. We had a relaxed late Sunday lunch with business colleagues/friends, so we were all in a good mood and no stress. Just as well, as the service was gloriously amateur... one of the waiting staff was doing some sort of waiting tai chi, every motion as slow and careful as she could, an order for a bottle of wine came as a glass of wine, the bottle, when it came, was opened in much the same way as a backstreet doctor would handle a late term abortion, and desserts came at the same time as some of the first courses. All actually quite entertaining and sweet. Nothing was really seriously wrong tho (oh, except no bread on the table and we couldn't order any - big black mark for western cuisine - bread is a basic!).I'd go again for a nice lunch or a really easy dinner with friends. Don't take clients, and don't go if you're in a rush, or feeling stressed yourself. Bring your own karma.
4
This was a casual dinner with visiting colleagues, one from Belgium and the other from Australia. One was staying at a hotel near Rochester, so I chose a place close to his hotel. This was my second choice actually, based on Trip Advisor rankings, and it turned out to be a pretty good choice.Nosh is all al fresco dining - there are no options for indoor tables with air conditioning. I normally don't like outdoor dining in Singapore, because it's warm and humid. But the weather was pleasant with a nice breeze, so it turned out ok.The menu was not as extensive as many others, just a few options for starters and mains - everything contained in a single page. For starters, we had the spice pork belly, garlic gnocchi and crab cake. For mains, we ordered their grilled salmon, pork chops and sea bass. Mine was the pork chops, and it was really good. My guests agreed the quality of each dish was very good. For dessert, my guests had cheese cake and toffee date cake, and again really enjoyed them.The wine was excellent - a French Ronan Rouge Merlot. It was a great combination, despite the main fish meals my colleagues ate.All in all, very nice

Entered Nosh at about 8PM without reservation, though the place looked busy (ongoing private event), the staff managed to find us a table for two. First time dining at Nosh and I must say it was such an enchanting enclave. Table setting and light decorations above were beautiful and charming. Definitely a romantic venue for couples.Service was top notch, we were fully taken care of and also given complimentary bread. It was certainly a nice gesture and for its professional service I will surely return. Menu was not too great, we prefer to have more choices when dining but poultry, vegetables and fish choices were available. Food came to the table within an acceptable timing, didn't get to try its desert but unfortunately there was not much choice either, so here is some room for the restaurant to improve. Otherwise, it was a splendid time dining at Nosh

Limited selection in their menu, but overall, awesome ambience to spend at with your loved ones. Very relaxed and chill place.

Rochester Park is the place for a quiet weekend getaway. I enjoy bringing the family here for brunch to have quality time. Food here is ok, but service could be improved. Overall, a good dining experience.

Had a dinner with my gf here for dinner. The place is pleasant and the staffs are very polite and helpful.
We had a delightful dinner and also had a cake for my gf's birthday which is on the house. Sweet :)

Excellent place for brunch. The eggs benedict are great, and their muesli is delicious. The location is in a traditional black and white house, surrounded by greenery, which is very nice. Only negative is that the coffee, for some reason, takes forever to arrive. We timed it and our lattes arrived 15 mn (!) after we ordered them, even though the place was barely a quarter full. Our friends' coffees also took a really long time. Other than, that, the juices and food are great. If you're looking for a chill place for brunch and are not in a rush, this is a great place

The tl;dr version: We had an intimate, DIY wedding lunch reception at Nosh just after Christmas, and it was a blast!The full story: We had chosen Nosh as our venue for celebrating our union for primarily three reasons: 1) they welcome relatively small parties, 2) they serve good food, and 3) they provide a setting ideal for ambitious brides who want to style their reception to their hearts’ content.Nosh holds about 80-100 optimally, perfect for our occasion, and the buffet lunch package they offered in minimum spending for a guestlist of that length was reasonable. We do wish that the $15 per person for free flow juice and soda could have also included coffee and tea for convenience, because guests tended to have a preference for either and not both. But other than that, the minimum spending amount and buffet rate per person were decent.It must be said that both the bride and the groom love to eat. We wouldn’t call ourselves picky, but we were not going to settle for the rather common unremarkable wedding fare that even hotels here can be found guilty of serving. Reviews we saw suggested that Nosh dishes out quality food, and we were able to confirm its reputation with a brunch visit and a tasting session of their buffet. We spoke briefly with the chef, who came across as very enthusiastic and passionate about his cooking, allowing us to customize some dishes on their prepared menu, so we had full confidence in the kitchen on the big day. (There is a full bar on the outdoor dining patio but due to alcohol allergies, we went dry, so can't comment on the drinks.)Our final criteria was that the venue must be “green and nature-y”, something that gives off an air of a garden party affair. Nosh, with its semi-al fresco dining patio with retractable awnings and vegetation all around, certainly fit the bill. Moreover, they were open to letting the wedding party provide their own decor, music, and additional food items if desired -- dessert, canapes -- so those who want to add customized elements to their event have quite a bit of freedom here. Nosh staff carefully watched over as we brought in our own floral arrangements, built our own floral arch, set up two photobooths in unconventional locations, hung DIY decor all over the venue, and added a DIY wedding cake along with special desserts to the restaurant’s menu. We had an atypical program and Nosh was very accommodating on all fronts.On to the staff. The event management team pays great attention to detail, from program placement to the frosting on the cakes we would be bringing in (to gauge when the staff would need to bring the cakes indoors to prevent “sweating”). Events Coordinator Carol Melbye advised us on the types of audio cables and equipment we needed for our own live music set-up, and Operations Manager Favian Hosain even gave us feedback on mic sound levels based on sound checks and our individual singing voices within Nosh’s acoustics.Some things to keep in mind as you plan your outdoor celebration -- you’re at the mercy of the weather and mosquitoes. If it pours heavily, there might be small puddles of water collecting at certain spots, as we saw during some of our visits while planning. Given the dense greenery of Rochester Park and Singapore’s tropical climate, mosquitoes are also inevitable. Thankfully we had great weather and few biting incidents -- the staff put out some sort of mosquito coils that were not distracting in sight or smell. It didn’t rain, so that meant the heat could not be dismissed, but we had prepared sandalwood fans as part of our door gifts and guests readily grabbed them to cool off throughout the event.Nosh is firmly on our list of regular dining places, and now, also a venue we know to be superb for special events too. *All photos courtesy of Zann Lee, taken on the day of our event, 27/12/1

I loved the ambience, snugly situated near Rochester, locating Nosh was a little tricky but it was well worth the effort!The manager looked after us so well and despite a few complications due to my carelessness, he did everything he could to make the visit as comfortable as possible.The table was neat, well set, and ready. The first course took a little while but the soup was good. Nothing extraordinary but not too bad :)The salad that followed 10 minutes later was one of the highlights!! My friends and I loved it.Up next, the entrees stole the show. The risotto was perfectly cooked, the mushroom were the perfect garnish and it was just fantastic!! The chicken, potato purée and beans were also unbelievable. This is a difficult to go wrong combination that they cooked and played elegantly. They ended the 4 course meal with a date toffee cake and a cheesecake. The toffee date cake was very good but an overly torched sugar layer on the cheesecake made it unpalatable. The best part on that plate was probably the raspberry compote and sauce. Good restaurant, would like to come again soon!

It was my 2nd time dining at Nosh and the experience was great. My friends from Australia loved dining in an outdoor setting with the sounds of nature all around (thank goodness the weather was good) and found it great that Nosh was slightly away from the busy Singapore that their so accustomed to. The relaxing atmosphere and great service was what sold Nosh for us

Plan for friend's birthday i decided to choose Nosh, because it is easily access by MRT and i like the outdoor ambience here, it is very windy and romantic set up. The food served are very nice and we miss the crab cake and complementary birthday cake for my friend. Thanks for they special arrangement and great services. We will definitely come back again for another nice gathering with friends. This place also suitable for some corporate event

First time at Nosh and I have to say we will be coming back. We sat on the outside terrace. Lovely atmosphere/ambiance. I started with the spiced pork belly, tried the Maryland Crab cakes and had the flank steak as a main. Lovely combination of flavours. Good selection for vegetarians

A gem tuck away in the corner of this crowded city. Delicious food, friendly and attentive staff, fantastic environment. First time here, and will definitely come back, hungry for more!

Planned a surprise for my boyfriend with a few close friends last weekend. The waitress who attended to us was very meticulous and made sure that everything went according to plan! Food was delicious and very affordable too. Great experience.

good variety for brunch. service was attentive and friendly. the servings were large and rather good value for money. the tables are set well apart so you don't get annoyed by loud neighbours.
in summary, great place for alfresco brunch.

Lovely setting for a Friday night dinner. Food was above average - not amazing but good enough for me. Drinks were reasonably priced for Singapore. We will go back.

Lovely food and great outdoor venue, definitely recommend the items on the menu with a fusion-y twist! Been twice (dinner earlier this year and brunch in August) and have not been disappointed by the food or the service :)

Ambience is nice. Food is good. We especially like the flank steak. The restaurant manager Teaz was especially friendly and made every effort talk to his customers, ensuring that they were well served. They took a little long time to serve the main, but Teaz was apologetic and offered to make up with complimentary dessert.

A delightful Sunday morning breakfast was made very special by both the lovely food and the caring attention of all staff at Nosh. When the observant team realised we were there to celebrate our daughter's birthday, a surprise "birthday" sticky date pudding, complete with candles, was brought to the table and all the staff gathered to sing happy birthday! A super special morning! We'll be back

the crab cake egg benedict was good but would prefer the fries that came with the beef burger to be of the "fat" type instead of the thin crispy type.Service was excellent thanks to Tiash (hope i got your name spelled right), John and one of the girls. Do tell them if you are there for any special occasions and they will prepare a surprise for you as we're told. But the kitchen was closed when they knew about it so hopefully the staff will still remember us when we return.Overall a great experience. Hope to have an indoor sitting next time! :

Arguably one of the freshest and best places I've been to recently. Something about the way the restaurant is tucked up in the corner of Rochester that provides a very exclusive touch. For the food; You HAVE to try their roasted chicken. By far the best poultry dish I've had. For desert, you must try their new addition, the caramel choco lava cake. I was left mouth watering the moment I had my first slice. The staff were as pleasant as the restaurant itself. Very forward coming. I was very impressed with their service. Kudos. A must try and declare it one of my new fav places.Certainly biased (:

I went there on a Weekday evening. The food and ambience were good. Unfortunately the waiting time was quite long, and we waited more than 20 minutes for our food. Also, I was celebrating my wife's birthday there and requested a small birthday cake when I made the reservation. However, even after I checked with the waiter on that day, the dessert cake took such a long time to come that I had to tell my wife and ruin the surprise. We spent around SGD100 for 2 adults
