I wanted something that would both light on the wallet and light in the belly and found it here. I had the steamed dumplings and the scalded greens and both were delicious. Very friendly staff and nice dining areas, inside or outside. i will return!

In terms of food quality and taste, number one in Chinatown. Recommend mini reb lobster, pepper crab, must try.

This restaurant is in “Food Street” Chinatown & is clean & reasonably priced, but don’t go out of your way to eat here. Much better Chinese food to be eaten elsewhere, nothing exceptional about their seafood dishes. We had chilli crab, black pepper crab & mini lobsters. Service is good, but their understanding of English is poor. I will try another place next time. Nothing about the meal or experience here would bring me back.

With so many places around the area for chilli crab it's hard to choose. I'm sure lots of others are good too but this black pepper crab was really great. As was out other dishes. All the staff are very freindly and prices are reasonable. For anyone after fresh crab I can highly recommend here

For the best chilli crab ever this place is worth going to. You choose your crab ,then they take it to the kitchens and cook it returning in 10 minutes or so in a delicious sweet chilli sauce. This alone makes the trip to Chinatown well worthwhile

Whilst wandering through Chinatown, there are lots of choices in the Smith street area when feeling peckish... This one is an absolute winner... We felt like something light, and the choices were great... Fresh and yummy, terrific staff with lots of helpful advice about their food... We had a lovely lunch, and enjoyed the bustling atmosphere of the street..

Oh what fabulous duck! It was the best I have ever eaten, and the pancakes were light and scrumptious. The chilli crab was also very tasty, with just the right amount of heat. You can also order different size crabs, which I thought an excellent idea. The service was fast and incredibly efficient. Interesting to see that the place was full of locals

We pounded the pavements of Chinatown for a while and finally settled on this one on Food Street (covered). We're both big fans and long time lovers of Chinese food, and boy were we rewarded -- my beef with chilis was incredibly delicious and plentiful, with other dishes (baby bok coy w mushrooms and grilled garlic prawns) closely matching. Staff very friendly. The place is small and cozy. Just wish I lived around there. Note the sign was ONLY in Chinese, not even a name in English but the address is posted as "16 Smith Street" and a big red lit-up red crab above the sign -- see pic attached
