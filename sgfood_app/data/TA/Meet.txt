Went for an early lunch. Food presentation looks pretty decent but the taste was disappointing. Mashed potatoes and sauces didn't seem to have any seasonings and they taste like instant stuffs. Roasted chicken was a tad bit too dry, could be reheated for too long.

Service was pleasant, food ordered was very appetizing especially the laksa pasta and crab linguine! Will got back for the 3rd time

Chicken was not cooked to the bone and came out lukewarm, even after the restaurant changed it once. Seems only the beef and pastas were decent enough to pass muster.

Went there with vouchers, there were other promotions going on as well. Food was served quickly, and the range of beer is extensive!

There was a good variety of dishes in the platter and most of the dishes were of impressive quality.

Not sure I would return. Found the food to be quite average whilst the pricing was not – it seemed to be a little on the high side. Menu was also rather limited.

Inside the City Square Mall, this restaurant is hidden behind the escalators. It is our first time to dine here and we are amazed on how great the food were. The prices are reasonable as the servings are huge. Their roast chicken is sumptuous. A must try as well is the mussels. It is not your typical stewed mussels. They serve alcoholic drinks as well. Definetly a must try when you are around Farrer Park area.

Ordered a crab linguine and quesadillas. Crab linguine was so-so. Had some tiny pieces of shell in the crab, but I Guess that's acceptable(?). Quesadillas came burnt at the corners. Tried to send it back to the kitchen, the Chef returned it and said it's meant to be burnt, so we had to accept it or order something else. Wouldn't go back there again

Staff are always cheery and helpful, and go the extra mile for service. Current promotion of steak and beer at $29.90 offers great value, steak is REAL GOOD steak, with the temperature right and a great serving of wedges to go with it. Also tried the mentaiko pasta which was PHENOMENAL. This restaurant is perfect for family/friend/couple occasions.

@TheKuoKnowsIf I had to describe Meet in three words it would have to be "gastro pub grub". The food is honest. They service is effective. And the staff are amiable.The Rib Eye was perfectly cooked. Nicely charred on the outside, whilst pink and juicy on the inside. The potatoe wedges were just as you would expect them - crunchy exterior and floury interior.The Beef Stew was as good as any I have had in a British pub. It was lick-the-bowl-clean good.Meet is everthing you would want from a casual diner. Good food; comfortable seating and friendly staff. Well done

Staff is very friendly who took time to explain their specialty, stew beef, which is pretty delicious. Order the beef cheek angel hair which is somehow does not blend together.

Sautéed broccoli was a tad too salty so I requested for it to be drained with water. However, Chef cooked a new plate of brocs for me. Thank you!

We order the set lunch which is of good value and the staff are all friendly and prompt. The place is clean and bright.

Service was not bad. Portion was sufficient. Ordered a whole chicken ($18+) and it was ample for one person. But limited variety of desserts.

Came here with family for a lunch.
Simple layout but good service and value for money food. The chicken is tender and the mussels and prawn rissoto is very good. Will certainly return to try the other dishes.

It took 1 hour to be served! Waiters were apologetic and friendly though. They must improve on waiting time.

Had lunch and ordered the sirloin steak. Came cold and overcooked...staff was helpful and changed another steak for me but still came cold..meat also hard and not fresh so i suspect they used frozen meat which is a no no for a restaurant charging 25 bucks for the steak. Disappointing experience..will not come again

Came to this restaurant after reading a number of recommendations online. Had the roasted chicken and the mentaiko pasta. The roasted chicken was tender and succulent with wafer crispy skin. The pasta came with a half boiled egg which added a sort of silkiness to the dish. The service was good and they gave a free kid's meal with $25 worth of ala carte orders.

Casual and friendly attitude of the servers put a couple of blokes looking for dinner and drinks well at ease. Other than the exceptional service, the variety of beers that they have is pretty good to say the least. The thing to improve would be their menu, which currently is pretty carbo loaded. Maybe they should have a greater variety of more flexible mains

The price of the food is very reasonable. The feedbacks that I wish to make is: firstly, the soup that I ordered is not hot enough when served to me. Secondly, the service staff is very inexperienced except for the Manager.On the whole it is a quite a pleasant and nice place to go for lunch
