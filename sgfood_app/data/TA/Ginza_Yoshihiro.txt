Excellent food! Our 3rd time there. Actually my wife and I were expecting the normal menu but they told us only v-day menu is being served. But nonetheless it is still very good! Love the oden and fresh sashimi!

The omasake sets are definitely worthwhile, food was superb and excellent service from Chef Ron and his colleagues. It was a fantastic treat for my wife, we were celebrating her birthday. We will definitely come back for more!

Food was uniquely crafted by Chef Ron who took good care of our appetite throughout the evening. It was a lucky find and my friends and I have no regret picking this restaurant as our meet up location. I'll definitely be back again...

We were here to have a light dinner. We ordered some sashimi and sushi, and wagyu sukiyaki. The foods were great and delicious. The service also very good. However, price wise, this restaurant is a bit expensive.

My friend booked a private dining room for our dinner, it was a nice private space to have for your group however it's not very sound proof as we can hear the other room having a business talk/seminar. I'm quite sure they could hear our laughters and it is probably distracting for them as well. Menu wise, a wide variety of fresh sashimi and sushi however it is a little on the pricey side. $120++ for 10 sashimi. Splurge on a good occasion if needed. Otherwise you can go for the grilled items - grilled salmon, cod fish, chicken and order rice. Each portion is around $18-$25, not including rice. Just take note that they don't have sukiyaki / udon etc. Chawanmushi was delicious as well as the tea pot tea

I took the $188 omakase set, which is very filling. The truffle chawanmushi is delicious. The king crab oden. tomato & radish clear & light. The rice with tea delicious & the fruits ( rock melon) heavenly. Sitting at the counter seats allow interaction with the chef. One thing to note is that the waitress is not very knowledgeable about the food served & not very smooth on the serving ( too much soy sauce poured on the radish

Amazing place for dinner! Went here with my other half for Christmas dinner and it was amazing. Incredible service and food, the chefs are very patient and friendly while guiding you through your meal.A fine blend of fine dining and bar concept, absolutely love it

Visited the previous Michelin star resturant in the same premise but was not impressed. Ginza Yoshihiro took over so decided to check it out since my target was to try 3-4 new restaurants every month. Simple Jap decor, not much ambience (pretty same as before) , ok for causal lunch or family dinner. We were having our lunch with background FM92/FM98 kind of music. I guess the music is from the bar attached to the resturant... I like the music although it does not goes w the place. I ordered the king crab Oden, the crab is sweet and the sauce is nice. The sashimi used in Chirashi is fresh and rice is well seasoned too. Value for money...around $50 each. Sad to say we were the only table there on a Saturday afternoon... I think they need more publicity.
