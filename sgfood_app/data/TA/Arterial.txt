Came here today with a friend for lunch and we ordered a selection of 4 dishes to share between us. I particularly liked the chicken liver pate, but the asparagus and the squid ink pasta were also pretty decent. The Hunter's Stew was so so, with the beef pieces being a little chewy with too much gristle for my liking. I also had a cappuccino which was excellent to finish the meal. Total cost was slightly under $80 which was ok value considering the quality of the food. Worth a visit

Second visit here for an afternoon break.. lovely place with interesting decor and chalk art on the wall! love the vintage coffee making pieces that adorn the wall and they're for sale too! Had a flat white before that was excellent, goes well with their croissants and rich mocha cake! Delicious! Great staff with great service and they're located right at the heart of Chinatown. Perfect place to drop by for a rest and to fill one's tummy after all the walking around Chinatown. Interesting menu of french food and deconstructed sandwiches. Will be back to try them
