We had family lunch last weekend at Putian Parkway. The food is always good. We loved the seafood soup (a longish shellfish with leafy white cabbage) and the classic putian fried beehoon. The place is clean and comfortable, and the service is also very friendly.

The new year set menu here is just horrible. Other than raw fish salad, everything is terrible. Not even their famous sweet and sour pork...Close to SGD 200 for 2 person...Better go hawker centre and eat.
Please run away when you see this place.

We really enjoyed our meal here. A great variety of food and staff were really helpful when we didn't quite know what the dishes were. Service was good for Singapore.
We will definitely be returning.

Nothing special about this place. Simple dishes at restaurant prices. Service is also average. Can skip if you want to.

First ever visit to Pu Tien was at Parkway Parade outlet. All the staffs there was friendly and welcoming. Was impressed by their service.Second visit to Pu Tien was as the Northpoint outlet during the CNY day 2. Staff was also welcoming and friendly. Made an appointment at 5.45pm and reached about 6pm. However,Still had to wait outside for about 5-10mins for the tables to be ready. Sadly,the service did not meet what I had expected. Maybe due to the busy cny period. As it was cny day 2, we ordered the set menu for dinner. Food was good but service was meh.. 1)Dishes did not came out in sequence as what a normal Chinese restaurant would practise or what was shown according to the menu. No big deal about this. 2)Food was continuously serve to the table when the table is full and we barely finish the previous dishes. Had to informed the server to slow it down. 3)When we were at the second last course which was the Mazu Mee Sua, the server informed us that they will serve it soon but the noodle have been sitting at their Food Trolley was almost past 10 minutes before it was being serve to us. Nevertheless, we received a complimentary stir fried yam as I believe the kitchen made an extra portion as we were asked if we ordered it which we did not. After awhile, the manager came over to the table and informed us that the Stir Fried Yam is on them.All in all, everything was good. Recommended dishes will be MaZu mee sua, Lychee Sweet and Sour pork, Stir fried Yam

Had dinner with family and took the set for fourDad happy with the food and had to packet the "lor mee" as we were already too full with the rest of the food. Only thing it is quite pricy, i think its good for special occasion

I'm a big fan of Pu Tien and know what to order off the menu. The food is consistency good and the chili sauce is the bomb. You can buy the chili sauce to go. This is one of my favorite chinese restaruants to go when I'm craving for some comfort food. Portions are decent but it is not cheap. My favorites are the Lor Mee, Tofu & the cockles

If you want something different from the typical Cantonese style Chinese food, try Putien. Stemming from the Fujian (Hokkien) province in China, Putien is not your regular Hokkien food found in Singapore. While there are other Putien style eateries around, Putien (the restaurant) offers a more refine dining option. Great for entertaining friends and family. The menu layout is so user-friendly spelling out its signature dishes all within a glance. These are my favourites and must-haves. Putien bee Hoon, deep fried trotters which comes with a disposable glove (talk about hands-on eating), marinated seaweed, deep fried yam, braised piggy intestines (sorry to gross anybody out). Generally I rotate around these dishes depending on how many are dining with me. To be honest, I haven't tried anything that I didn't enjoy. A good dining experience that can be further upped with individual pots of Chinese tea. Oh yes. Putien makes the most delicious pickles and chilli. It is the perfect condiments and definitely worthy of a mention. Try and tell me if I'm wrong

Started eating when it was still in an old coffeeshop in Maude Rd. Prices have increased alot. Like their Bee hoon, fried fish and the red fermented wine chicken. The sauce for their appetiser pork witness cucumber taste much better with just cucumber alone. Don't really like their white version of the Lor Mee anymore. Ordered their seasonal clams with salt & pepper which costs $20 for a small plate.

Pu Tien is certainly a chain (with around a dozen outlets in S'pore) and it is a restaurant we have walked past many times without giving it a second glance. However, the Fujian style offerings are certainly worth sampling. They have some very interesting fish dishes, befitting an origin in coastal China.We tried two outlets. Both had a slightly higher end feel to the decoration and layout of the restaurant and the staff were efficient and polite. Dishes that we really did enjoy included - baked duck, drunken cockles, bamboo herbal prawn, brazed bitter gourd, sea bass and the excellent deep fried squirrel fish. Their tasty in-house chilli is also worth a mention.They do set-meals for parties of up to 10. Those seem to be roughly about $50 per head - before drinks and ++. Our bill for four diners came to around S$300 each time (no alcohol taken) which is about average for a middle range restaurant locally. Not food court level of pricing but worth paying a little extra for comfort and privacy

Visited during Chinese New Year. Only set menus available. The caramelized yam dessert was unique and worth going for again.

For the type of quality of food served and the price charged, I can only rank them as average only. Better food elsewhere for the same price.

Great food! It made a real change to the standard food offered elsewhere in Parkway Parade. It was very different, had a really extensive menu and the staff were very helpful. More expensive than the other shopping mall food but it was worth it!

The menu was filled with food not commonly found in other restaurants as it was supposed to be food indigenous to a certain region in China.
I like the pig intestine which was crunchy and tasty.
The yam dessert was fantastic too.

This restaurant serves excellent Chinese food at moderate prices. The menu covers extensive variety of Chinese food and also single dish rice / noodles meals.Food served was tasty. I would rate the fried bee hoon dish as one of their signature dishes that one must try.The restaurant is very crowded especially on weekends during lunch and dinner.As there is limited seating,it is best you make a reservation for a table. I was there for lunch on two occasions last month,once on a Sunday and the other on Tuesday.Service by staff was very good on Tuesday but the same cannot be said of the service provided by staff on Sunday.As it was crowded,staff were "running" from one table to another taking orders and serving meals.We had the feeling everything was rushed so that other customers could occupy our table when vacated

If you are looking for value for money, tasty Chinese food that is a little different from the usual Chinese restaurants, and with good ambience and service to boot, look no further. We had 8 dishes on a weekday lunch and the total bill came up to just S$113 after taxes. Each dish is about $10 to $13, not too large a portion so it is ideal for 4 to 6 persons to share. You have many options to choose from. We loved the sweet and sour pork, stewed radish, deep fried egg plant with pork floss, soupy spinach with century egg, steamed croaker fish for just $12, and fried bee hoon. The cold herbal chicken dish and fried tofu were average. There are several Putien outlets in Singapore, and this one is on the second floor of Parkway Parade shopping center in the east. Service is efficient and warm. I was surprised how crowded it was even on a weekday lunch.

We had overseas business visitors and wanted a good quality chinese restaurant to take them. We arrived without reservation on a Tuesday afternoon at 1pm but there was not wait. Service was friendly and efficient. The menu was expansive and impressive. The quality and taste of the food was equally good. Portions were generous and the presentation was upmarket. Be prepared to pay premium pricing for what you get. It was a good decision going there and our guests enjoyed the experience very much

This restaurant serves Heng Hwa cuisine from Fujian. We were unfamiliar with it and decided to come here because -- while a chain -- it's been voted among Singapore's top 50 places to eat. We were not disappointed. The sweet and sour pork is excellent, as is the steamed shrimp with garlic sauce. We also tried the chilli clams and Putien lor mee. All very good

First off, you can be assured of great professional service here. The ambience is pleasant and tastefully simple, and not too big or too small a restaurant. So it's not a big crowd but neither are you dining alone. The ingredients are top quality and you can taste and see the extra effort put into preparing your food. What I find refreshing is that while it is Chinese food and there are very many quality Chinese restaurants in Singapore, the menu here is different from the usual fare. So if you're looking to try a new Chinese menu, this is the place hou are looking for. Prices are above average but not exhorbitant. It's about $40 per person when we done there. Enjoy

This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Chinese food done simply and perfectly. There are so many excellent dishes to choose from that I don't know where to start. The home-made bean curd is to die for. It melts in your mouth - absolute heaven ! The Spinach with Century Egg is another one of my favourite dishes as is their signature Fried Vermicelli which is cooked to perfection. Also try the Kailan with Beancurd skin. The Shredded Beef with Bun is also popular. I was also impressed by the Deep Fried Duck with Yam.I've been there many times and have never been disappointed by this restaurant. The style of cooking is clean and fresh. This restaurant has several outlets and is worth a visit. Reservations are an absolute must for dinner
