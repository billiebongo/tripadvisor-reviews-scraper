Never expect this is such delicious Ban Mian in the town. Really good to give a try!
There are few recommended options you can choose. Price started from $5. Worth it with the taste and the portion.

Nothing beats the original in KL. But still acceptable. More options here like clam and sea asparagus. Recommended the original Dry Chilli Pan Mee

I was telling my friends how I wanted to try their noodles so desperately (but I wasn't a fan of long queues). So after 3 years, I managed to do so! I went at 7pm, just an hour before they close and ordered their Signature Dry Chilli Pan Mee! Many times when we try ban mian (handmade noodles in soup), the noodles tend to be either overcooked, too floury, or worse, undercooked. But here, the noodles (you mian, similar shape to spaghetti) have a nice bite, with a great consistency. The bowl is further adorned with generous helpings of fried shallots, meatballs, anchovies, minced pork and topped with a poached egg. Like what we all do with poached eggs, BREAK THE YOLK - mix it with the noodles, not forgetting a dollop of chilli served at the side. Go easy on the chilli because it gives a nice kick to the noodle dish

I came by to see and try for myself because my local friends told me that this noodles are the best and authentically from KL.I doubt there are any good Malaysian noodles here in sg cz the standard between hometown and overseas are completely different. (Cz I'm a Malaysian myself)When i had there, they prove me wrong. It was indeed authentic and delicious. Fishcakes and fishballs were great too.Will go again after peak hours of course when there's no queue..lo

This stall selling very famous Dried Ban Mian. Specially make a trip down to try it. I read fourm that you may need to queue for 1-2hours, hence i avoid the peak period. I went at 3pm and i do not need to queue at all. It's self-service counter.You must mix the egg yolk and chilli before you try it. I'm not a chilli lover but i put a bit of it to try whether is it nicer. I feel that its nicer. I really love it this dried ban mian so much. definitely will come again. I guess the nearest MRT station to this place is Potong Pasir (NEL line)

Having tried the Dried Ban Mian in Restoran Kin Kin in Kuala Lumpur (KL) two years ago, and still remembering how nice it was, I was glad when Kin Kin came to Singapore. However, it took me a while to finally decide to drop by to try it, because when it first opened, the queue could take 2 hours (including waiting time) so I wasn't about to do that for any food at all. Today, I finally managed to pop by!The Singapore's version ... oh well, there is a more extensive menu, for one. It came in a big bowl with a side bowl of vegetable soup on the side - something which I appreciated, and deemed as rather thoughtful. Of course, the price of one bowl of Ban Mian here cost SGD$5.00 here.The noodles were served with a little chilli, ikan bilis (anchovies), meat balls, a poached egg and shallot in lieu of spring onion.I began to toss the noodles with the other ingredients (always get a thrill of poking the egg yolk and watching it flowing luxuriously over my food). Upon taking the first bite, I found it to be rather bland in flavor - there was not much hint of spiciness, nothing like the one I had in KL. I tried a second bite, and came up with the same verdict. Maybe they are trying to tailor the taste to suit locals' tastebud (cannot be too spicy).Then I spotted the "Pan Mee Chilli" on the tabletop and that made all the difference. I slowly added chilli powder in dollop after dollop - after about 5 full dollops (I love spicy food by the way), the taste was finally adjusted to a close resemblance of the one I had in KL. Now my noodles was spicy and crispy with the anchovies, and I enjoyed it tremendously.The addition of meatballs was another nice touch. Lastly, the restaurant is air-conditioned so it was comfortable eating here, even during lunch hours.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/03/kin-kin-ban-mian-in-kl-vs-kin-kin-ban.htm

This trip to this unique Pan Mee Restaurant this week was highly satisfactory. The dried noodles was served differently but with lots of thoughts & good ingredients added in it for only S$5/- which was unusual in such a nice clean environment! There were 3 fresh big tasty fishballs ( handmade) with a few meat balls & lots of fragrant fried shallots & fried ikan bilis ( anchovies) which added flavours to the food. There sambal chillies added to the noodles created the unique noodles which was common in Singapore. I had a great meal. This should be recommended to all who would like to try the unique delicious & excellent way of serving the noodles! It is really yummy value for your dollar!!

The food is generally different from the other "Bian Mian" that I find from the Food Courts. It is not expensive and it is comparable to "Food Court Price". Can you imagine paying the same price for some "Cannot Make It" food? A combination of my favorite ingredients (BIG hand-made fishball, Semi-liquid state Egg & of course the chilli and noodle) make my meal a joyful one.I can totally imagine one can get "Jelat" as know as "flavour overdose" with one kind of noodle if it is a daily affair. With the new menus in, I can get to alternate my dosage with different type of noodles.The hype only happens between lunch (11am - 2pm) and dinner (6pm - 8.30pm). I am so lucky to be able to visit during the in between timing; I get to take my time to enjoy the meal and hang out with friends. Alternatively, I will go and "tabao" also known as take-away to get away from the crowds.GOOD FOOD BRINGS LONG QUEUE! Love it

Originating from KL, Kin Kin Restoran's famous Pan Mee has now made its way across the border onto our shores. The initial hype has now died down which makes it a good time to visit.Signature Dry Chilli Pan Mee ($5)Served dry (almost al dante), this bowl of pan mee packs a punch when mixed with its potent chilli paste and soft boiled egg. The minced meat tastes very much like those you get in Nonya Dumplings. Certainly a refreshing alternative to the other ban mian versions you can get locally.Handmade Fishball Soup ($3.50)The fishballs were huge and you could almost taste the fish meat with each bite. You could simply tell that they were handmade from the texture alone. The soup is merely secondary to the fishballs in this dish.Verdict:Worth a visit if you have not tried Kin Kin before. Not overly expensive comparatively to the other Malaysian noodle houses here (Sarawak Kuching Kolo Mee, Pontian Wanton Noodles

Tried the signature ban mien and the noodles was a very nice firm texture. The mince meat, meat balls, crispy anchovies and topped with a fried egg makes for a nice combination. The meat balls was just the right texture. First couple of mouthfuls after mixing everything including the chillie paste together was just great. But........Watch out for the chillie paste that you add to the noodles. It takes the top of your head off.After the first few mouthfuls, the greasy nature of the combination just hits you. Had to struggle to finish off the last few mouthfuls.Overall, apart from the extreme greasy combo, it was decent and at SGD 5 per serving, decent value
