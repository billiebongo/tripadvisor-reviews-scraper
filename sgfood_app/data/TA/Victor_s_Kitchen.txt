Much like a foodcourt with communal seating and little space. People go for the authentic dim sum that is difficult to find. The dishes are hit or miss however the portions are generous and nothing was “bad”. The staff are helpful and prompt.

Good food, nice air-conditioned place. Self-service, so don't come expecting great service. It's underrated compared to famous dim sum places like Swee Choon.
Come in the morning (10:30) to avoid the crowd. Try their salted egg bun and prawn dumpling.

oh my god so delicious. We tried 7 different dishes and each was delightfully tasty. The service was excellent and pricing was very good.
2
The food is very mediocre and overpriced. There are better dim sum places in Singapore at that price range. Service is non-existent and settings were cramped.
I will not patronize again ...

We came across Victor's Kitchen quite unexpectedly. Tiny shop in an arcade on Bencoolen St. We ordered based on pix and were delighted with every offering. Victor addded the egg tarts to our menu and we were so glad he did, they are amazing.

Happened to pass by and decided to give it a try. Ordered 9 dishes for two, a little too much, but this gave us the opportunity to try a variety of food. Although there is no service charge and GST is already included in the price, it may be a tad on the high side considering the neighbourhood. But food-wise, am pretty delighted with some of the dishes. So overall speaking, am happy to pay for what I get.The carrot cake with XO sauce is the best I ever had, there are literally slices of radish in every bite, lovely. I like the har kau (prawn dumpling) too, the skin is so thin and the prawn filling is generous. The golden shrimp roll is tasty; despite it being deep fried, it doesn't leave you with that awful oily feel. The Nemo's porridge (fish with century egg) is pretty good too, there are so much ingredients, every mouth of porridge has something to go with it. I don't eat Phoenix claws (chicken feet) but my mum said that they are really good; unlike other restaurants, they don't fry the chicken feet here, so the natural taste is retained and in fact, the feet were better able to absorb the flavour of the accompanying sauce.Happy to come back again the next time I'm around here

as i am a solo eater,i only tried the boat house porridge and steamed flour rolls with char siewthis place do not need to pay gst and service charge.ordering simple just need to indicate the table and tick your orders and pay at cashier.The porridge is so so only.not much ingredients but smooth enough.the steamed flour rolls the texture is too thick not silky soft..but appearance looks very good only.Will think twice before patronising again

Had very good experience here. Unfortunately today's trip I am disappointed. Prices of food has gone up close the upmarket dim sum restaurants. This place used to be known as good and inexpensive....now you have to take out the "in". Quality has gone down, the Cheong fun feels like yesterday's texture. The polo bao was the saving grace probably the only reason I will come back if I ever consider coming. Sad another "used to be a favorite" on the decline

A recommendation from a local brought us to a slightly low key shopping centre and a small but friendly restaurant called Victors Kitchen. Oh my! This is what I've been looking for for years. Proper Dim Sum. Everything we tried (and we tried almost everything!) was delicious and fresh. We were so happy that we sought this place out. You must try the Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun - there's even a sign on the wall saying as much. Lovely staff and the next time I'm in Singapore I'll be going again.

They are really good at dim sum! their best dish is the lava salted egg bun... I came here as I walk past this restaurant and recall their famous dish! Worth trying... Did find the price a little high but reasonable since they are one of the top dim sum. Their seating are pretty average and not of nice restaurant as people mainly come for the food here
1
was there last weekend.
Ordered their much-talkabout siew mai, har kau, salted egg custard bun, chicken glutinous rice wrapped in leaf, ice stocking tea, etc.
Was very disappointed with taste of food and also all items overpriced!!
Not worth it, will never patronize again.
4
Phoenix Claws and Spinach & Prawn Dumplings a must. Everything was hot and fresh tasting. Planning to sample more this week.
3
Food is rather average, was quite empty when visited. Service is inexistent as mentioned by other reviewers but didn't expect it to be that bad.
Dim sum were so-so and there are better dimsum places out there.
5
One of the best authentic Hong Kong Dimsum in Singapore... Freshly made and reasonable prices... just like eating out in a street cafe in Hong Kong !
5
The food is awesome and really authentic! Nothing fancy or posh, but hey this is how true HK dim sum should be like! Avoid lunch time hours, this place is really popular for local.
A must try: liu-sha-bao, steam carrot cake and xiu mai
3
Heard alot but have yet to drop by.Impromptu to settle brunch for 3 persons. Was crowded when we reached. Ordered some of the recommended - chai tao kuey, char siew polo bun and Har Kau.Yes, these 3 are my favourite after the visit especially the Har Kau - fresh prawns! Overall each person is at $20. Felt that it was overpriced.Yum,Jazly
2
Overview:Hearing lots of good things about this Dim Sum place, was quite disappointed with the food after all the hype.Pro:- prices were reasonableCons:- cramp sitting- prawn dumplings were very dry- all other dishes were about the same as most generic dim sum stalls in Singapor
2
Was looking forward to try this as my friend and I heard good reviews, but the food was just alright. Also, the menu was very limited and we felt that the food was overpriced for what it was, and you could definitely find nicer dim sum in Singapore
5
Craving for dim sum and milk tea? You have to visit Victor's Kitchen then.Their dim sum is really really good! and the famous milk tea that separate the ice to avoid the ice diluted into the milk tea.Go with a few friends so that you can order more dim sum to eat
5
Get ready to be scolded if you are naughty! I meant if you are picky. This is not the restaurant for you if you are looking for good service. The people (I don't use waitress nor waiter) working there just clean the place, show you the particular seat they want you to sit and take your order; no formalities, no smile and no service! But all ends there, the food is superb, very authentic HK dim sum with a twist of personal ingenuity.When I wrote this review I had not read any review from others. I just know that Victor's Kitchen is always full-house with many people queueing outside. The HK ice milk tea or the Ying Yang was refreshingly sweet and it is cooled with ice cubes in a bowl, so the ice cubes do not dilute the milk tea when they are melted. It is a must to try.The dim sum selection was awesome, the siu may and har gao was very good, the prawns were fresh. The lo Ma gai was wrapped in nice smelling lotus leaves. What was extra-ordinary was the steamed chicken rice and the XO carrot cake. They are not just made different from other Dim Sum shops but also taste sooo delicious. The egg yolk lava bun and the egg tart is a must to complete the meal. They are soo satisfying in the mouth
4
The atmosphere is very lively and local. Don't expect fancy digs but do expect reasonable pricing. The staff are quite helpful and will remember you if you return more than once. Great dim sum and noodles but I recommend you order what you know, first, before trying something new. Not to miss - the homemade XO sauce and the egg custard tarts
3
The food look sooo delicious and appetizing. Taste are good.... Boss seems to be a hongkie. Workers mostly aunties and they will hard sell their food. Environment and seats are limited and less spacious. But still okay.Variety choices, crystal dumplings was good with full of vege. Very tasty sticky rice we ordered two. All others are quite standard and freshly made.When I was there, I was thrilled cos I thought I found a good dim sum here in Singapore. But the after eaten effects at night was very thirsty... If you don't mind the msg, you can just drink more water after that. I have suggested another similar dimsum place, check out my other reviews

Victor's is near my workplace and we only come here during odd hours like 3pm on a weekday. It' is the only time one can get some elbow room and reasonably OK service. On a weekday lunch hour and all day Saturday, the place is packed to the brim with diners after yummy dim sum at reasonable price. My favorites: radish cake with XO sauce, prawn dumpling, crispy prawn roll and until the decline of the bun quality - the egg yolk lava bun. If you don't fancy sitting back to back, jostling for elbow space with your fellow diners and a slightly dirty eating place, getting and filling up your own order sheet and check, then this is a GO. But if you're like me who value good service, cleanliness and some elbow room to eat properly, you're better off coming in the odd hours or skipping this altogether for other places

Come here for lunch with friend and order the followingPrawn Dumpling (nice)Polo Bun (the char siew is nice, but the bun itself not really nice, the topping should be sweeter and crispier)Carrot cake (quite nice and a bit special as it is steamed and served in xo sauce that have fragrant smell and quite appetizing)Teo chew style dumpling (my favourite from all the dishes from this restaurant. the dumpling quite special. it consist of mixed vegetables and fried peanuts that make the combination perfect)Egg yolk lava bun (my 2nd best choice. the egg yolk have fragrant buttery smell)Glutinous Rice (taste so so, chicken taste a bit weird)Their way in serving hong kong milk tea is quite special. they serve the ice in a bowl and tea inside a plastic cup, so the tea taste nice because thicker and not diluted with the iceThe service is acceptable, not very efficient as the restaurant always packed and I have a bit unpleasant experience because they charge me double portion of egg yolk lava bun (I only order 1 actually) but I just realised later. Small matter but next time will be more carefu

I had to run some errands at sunshine plaza and so I googled for some food that I can try since I am there. Victor's kitchen came out in the search and it's apparently one of the famous dim sum place in the area. Having read about their level of service, I was prepared not to expect anything about their service and just go to try out the 'famous' dim sum.Well, we ordered the famous lava buns, char siew chee cheong fun, chicken glutinous rice, siew Mai and prawn dumpling (Har Kow), congee etc. The price for each item (per basket) is a about $4.80 on average. Though it's only slightly cheaper than Crystal jade or imperial treasure, it's quality is definitely below par... I can live with the poor service, the cramp sitting area and having to share the table with strangers etc. but the quality of food is very disappointing.This is the first time that I come across a lava bun that has the 'lava' oozing out of the bun even before you break it. One of the reviewer was right, the lava filling was grainy and oily with oil literally dripping out of the buns. First time not finishing a glutinous rice at a dim sum restaurant... It taste bad and was very oily. Har Kow as acceptable with a generous filling of prawns - that was probably the only thing that was good. Siew Mai was average and congee was watery and you see more fish cake than any of the other ingredients that are supposed to be in the congee.If you have been accustomed to the taste of the likes of imperial treasure or even tim ho wan, you will be very disappointed with the quality of dim sum served here. Some food court or coffee shop dim sum stall can do better.Also, there was this waitress that has purple colors short permed hair. She was rude and definitely frustrated with her work... It was all in her face. Unless she is a relative, why employ someone with such an attitude to work in the restaurant? Though the others were less loud and some even pleasant, this one 'ajumma' definitely spoils the ambience in the place.Well, this is the first and definitely the last time that I frequent this place. How much do I save... Probably the 10% service charge and gst.. But to have to put up with such food and service, I rather not eat and save the calories.If you are a tourist, don't even bother checking this place out and waste your time. Go to Tim Ho Wan to satisfy your craving for HK dim sum

Went for dinner with my family of 4 on a Saturday evening. We were lucky to be given a table immediately. A queue was formed 10 minutes after we were seated.We ordered 1. Polo Char Siew Bun - the crust is crunchy and the Char Siew is tasty. The sauce is so much that it kept dripping on to my hands. A must try for char Siew bun lover.2. Steamed carrot cake in XO sauce - the carrot melts in the mouth! Coupled with the XO sauce and the small char Siew cubes, this is one of my favourite too.3. Chicken & Sausage glutinous rice in lotus leave - the glutinous rice is sticky and you can taste the fragrance of the chicken and sausage in the rice. My younger daughter loved the glutinous rice so much that she finished 2/3 of the rice. There is a big piece of chicken and meat wrapped in the rice too. 4. Steamed spare rib - the meat is tender and well seasoned with black bean. Yummy!5. Fried prawn dumpling - my elder daughters' favourite.6. Siew Mai - my daughters loved this too.7. Spicy 'Phoenix claw' - ok, but nothing to shout about8. Prawn dumpling 9. Egg tart - thin but crunchy crust, but a bit blend in taste. 10. Mango sago dessert - I have tasted better version....Service was friendly but don't expect 5* restaurant service. A waitress allowed us to take our time in choosing our tables, another wished my daughters Happy New Year as she served the dishes, another told us to inform her when we want the dessert to be served. Victor always wears a smile on his face and greeted the patrons in a friendly manner. We spent S$66 for 4.It was a good dinner and we agreed that we will be back for more..

Victor's Kitchen occupies a cramped space in Sunshine Plaza, with tables and chairs that are never left vacant especially during lunch break. They have about 30 or so dimsum choices and most of them quite tasty. We weren't happy about the egg yolk lava bun though, which we found too oily and the bun a bit grainy and not as soft as they usually make it in HK. You will spend an average of 15sgd for dimsum and drinks, depending on your appetite. Service is quite fast but don't expect the servers to be gentle or even very accommodating, given that they need to serve orders almost in a mechanical/robotic fashion considering the volume and turnover of customers. They close quite early, too, so lunch break would be the most ideal time for you to pop in. They don't have tissue/serviette here so I suggest you bring your own as dining at Victor's Kitchen sure could get a bit oily and messy

Its my first time eating there, Group of three went there for dinner, we ordered 1) siew mai, 2) Chicken Feets, 3) York Lava Bun, 4) Steamed Dumpling, these 4 items tasted average. Nothing to shout about.1) Steamed Ribs Rice ( taste plain), 2) Wala Wala Porridge ( taste plain & watery texture), 3) Steamed Spare Ribs (insufficient seasoning & porky smell), 4) Steamed Carrot cake ( No Carrot taste), 5) Steamed Char Siew Ceong Fun ( taste plain), these 5 items taste below average

I have been working around the area but has never tried the food before as they always seem to be packed. It just happened to open for business at 10.30 am when we went to NAFA (which is just opposite). At 10.15 am, there was already a short queue, we decided to give it a try since we were there at the right time. It didn't take long for all the tables to be filled. At about 11am, when we started eating, there is quite a queue already. So be sure to arrive at 10.30 am sharp if you don't want to wait. The famous orders were pasted on the walls. The 奶黄流沙包 was delicious and the paste was runny and creamy. My little fussy eater finished it up in mins. The 烧荬and 虾饺 are average. Another favourite seems to be the carrot cake with XO and scallop sauce, this was nice as the carrot cake melts in the mouth. The 排骨 is not as tasty, meat was hard and seasoning did not seemed sufficient. Eating there is an objective business. Eat and go as there is a long queue. Place is tight so it's quite squeezy, but brings about the Hong Kong feel. We ordered about 5-6 items for 2 adults and 1 young kid which cost us about $50

The dim sum is above average and better than most restaurants.The dining ambience is not so good. You sit on stools in tables so close to each other that you have to get up if somone along the table wants to move pass you. There can also be bug crowds here and you may have to queue. Nevertheless, it should be worth the hassle
1
Dim sum was so-so, edible I guess. But the staff is so darn rude. I didn't expect service, but I would appreciate basic courtesy.

Delicious HK dim sum. Prepare to Queue if you are going there at Lunch or Dinner time. I will recommend the lava custard bun. it's amazing.

I was with come colleagues at Sunshine Plaza along Bencoolen Street and they suggested this dim sum place. The place is packed with people and we ordered the following items:- Pan Fried Chee Cheong Fun: This was topped with Soya sauce before serving us. Was alright.- Steamed Carrot Cake: Very traditional dim sum that is steamed instead of pan-fried.- Assortment of Steamed Dim Sum: Tried the Har Gow, Siew Mai, which were OK. - Lor Mai Kai: The chicken filling was good and I liked this dish.- Steamed Rice with chicken: This was good. My favorite dish for the meal and it will fill your tummy, if you are a big eater.- Liu Sha Bao (Custard Bun): The skin is thin and after 5 mins, the oil of the custard filling was starting to be seen through the skin. Not so keen on this version of the custard bun.The food is not as refined as that you will find at fine Chinese restaurants. The pricing here is also not as cheap as what I expected for non- fine Chinese restaurant. If you are looking for a place to dine that is 'slightly reminisant' of dining at a Hong Kong cafe, you can come here

Their golden egg yolk custard bun has a oily texture which makes it really watery. Furthermore, we found plastic shards in it as well! Informed the staff and they didn't seem sorry about it at all though they changed a new one for us. Would not recommend this place to anyone

First time I came was to order a take away and I waited over an hour to collect my food. It was just sitting at the counter as they didn't bother telling me it was ready. I was merely sitting at the front of the counter waiting. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and went back a second visit, again for a take away. This time, I got my order within 10 mins and I was happy. But upon opening the containers at home, it was the wrong order. Not only that, it was a subsequently lesser value to what I paid. I think these guys are just out to make money and do not give a thought or care about their customers. The lava yolk buns that they swear is a must-try is covered in oil and the insides along with the salted egg yolk is a whole layer of oil. I would never go back, and I don't think anyone else should. Until they start to take more care and notice of their paying customers, they should close up and not bother trying to make a living with poor service and nonchalant attitude

Victor, the boss cum chef is a Hong Kong national, you can spot him cooking and serving the customer enthusiastically. It is a small shop in the shopping mall with about 25 seats - and probably 10 different designs of plastic stools! Absolutely zero ambience. Their must-try dim sums are golden egg yolk lava bun, king prawn dumping (chunky and crunchy), rosy wine char siew bun, and the 100% HK style ice tea! Food is great and service is no nonsense. You are here to enjoy the steaming hot and authentic HK dim sum, nothing more. Be prepared to pay $15 per head if you are a big eater, as the dim sums are simply so irresistibly great that you will order more and more

Victor's Dim Sum has indeed, a very bare and authentic HK cafe setting, with furniture seemingly randomly bought from the value store. I was there at 3pm, but the Auntie was pretty friendly and not a grouchy pickle. Food wise is pretty good, like the Char Siew Bao and Prawn dumplings, but its no longer the value for money dim sum it was years ago. Now 2 Char Siew Baos cost $4.50, while the Har Kao was $5. Quite a big portion, but this is definitely in the restaurant price range, although without service and tax charge. Oh yes, the famed Egg yolk custard bun also had a flaw; the butter oil had separated from the custard and the emulsion was splitting apart. So texture wise was very oily, but the flavour was there. Someone messed up the technique during whipping of the custard.Don't go during Peak meal hours or you will queue at least 30 minutes. I would have given Victor's 4 stars, but as mentioned, it is no longer value for money
4
I have heard rave reviews about this place and decided to check it out before flying back to Taipei this weekend.Their custard buns are fantastic and give Tim Ho Wan (Hong Kong not Singapore's shop) a run for the money. Their steamed prawn dumplings (har gao) are value for money if you see the number of prawns per dumpling (i counted 3-4 per dumpling). Their steamed carrot cake is a must-try especially with the specially made fried onions-chili sauce. Their chee cheong fun on the other hand is so-so only and their siew mai, in my opinion, is average. I will come back to try the rest of the dishes another time and of course, my strongly recommended 3 dishes

gotta try their custard bun. place needs to some clean up, you'll see cartons of bills at the side. lady boss uses bare hands to put the ice inside the drink, the same pair of hands where she uses it to handle money.i wouldn't say that they are value for money. but definitely worth a try. for the fact, that you can pay an amount where you can go to cleaner looking and air conditioned places. it's more about the ambience, the part where there's no such thing as customer service. hahaha. gotta try them, cos what you're paying for is the dining experience. it's a rough place. so if you're not ok with dirty tables, long waiting time, lady boss shouting at service crew, then probably it's not the place for you. if you like the rough kinda culture and ambience, it's definitely your place. you would probably think they can make a film about this place too.
4
One of the best dim sum outside Hong Kong!!!Food sometimes out of stock!!! But as long as the custard bun available is worth it!!! Try to avoid te peak hrs like lunch time. A very small shop so sometimes have to share table!!! Taste was great and authentic!!! Forget about the service!!! A must for custard bun lovers!!

This is the best Cantonese Dim Sum after the Fook Yun Restaurant. The chef is from Hong Kong and and the dim sum is very nice and special. You can find a very special carrot cake here too. Yum yum
4
Best dim sum and really value-for-money...

the har-kao is so nice!!!! the prawn fillings r woohoo! however, they dun have much of a variety of dimsum. just the usual har-kao, siew mai, wanton, springrolls, lor mai kai,

This place is at sunshine plaza, which is in the middle of town. For the benefit of tourists to Singapore, the address is 91 Bencoolen Street, #01-21, Sunshine Plaza. Owner is from Hong Kong and the feel is exactly like a small eating place in HK - cramped, no-frills, no reservations but very good food.There is almost always a queue outside the shop anytime of the day. But you don't have to wait too long - maybe 30-40 mins max.I have tried the following items:Steamed carrot cake with XO sauce - excellent (my fave)Golden egg yolk lava buns - excellentGlutinuous rice with chicken & sausage - excellentsiew mai (shumai) - excellent with chunks of prawns and meatFried fritters wrapped in cheong fun (steamed rice roll) - excellentChar siew buns - OKSteamed spare ribs with black bean sauce & rice - OK but too little ribsAll the food is a little on the salty (and very full flavoured) side. They probably use quite a bit of MSG in their cooking. Clealiness is not high on their list but who really cares when the food is good.Price is reasonable for the quality of food that you are getting. Expect to spend S$15-S$20/pax for an enjoyable meal.I'll add to this review when I visit them again

One of the better dim sum in town. There is always a long queue outside this little cafe. Young and old were seen to eat at and like this place. The dim sum were freshly made, taste good. Siew Mai is not bad, har gao also not bad. The steamed carrot cake is really good. The chicken feet is not bad. The pork rib is so so. The custard pao is also very very good.. Definitely a place to go for good and fairly priced dim sum... If you don't mind the queue.
4
Its a small coffee shop in the middle of town.. there is no way to make reservations.. it opens from 8am plus til slightly pass lunch.. you need to queue and it would be easy to grab seats if is just 2-3 pax... difficult to get seats for a big group as the restaurant space is small and cramps..but its worth the wait, queue-ing 45min-1 hours to have a bite of the mouth watering custard pao.. its about $5 for 3 pieces.. dimsum, porridge is not bad.. chee cheong fun finished at 11ama, which we could not even have a try of it.. our bill for 6 pax added up to about $100 plus but about more than 15 stacks of prawn dumpling, siew mai and chicken claws etc..overall, it was a very satisfying brunch...waited for almost 1 hour, but it was worth it.. food tasted good, but wished that the restaurant open to cater for bigger groups ;
