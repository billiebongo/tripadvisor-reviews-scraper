Great and interesting food at chef Karl Dobler and Eugenia Ong's restaurant, a perfect match of Indonesian and European influences, always perfectly made and presented. Add Karl and Eugenia's hands on presence and many regulars - that's Table at 7.

Cosy indeed, relatively reasonably priced, white-table clothed restaurant with awesome Asian/European fusion plates, the place was empty when we went so we have terrific service and a wonderful meal.

A nice little restaurant with special nicely done dishes at reasonable prices. Please book in advance and don't ever go there without a booking.

We recently went here with a group of friends and this is my first time here. It was basically for a launch and loved how beautifully Chef has incorporated Apples in every dish served and every dish has a distinct flavour and was awesome.Smoked duck waldorf with light yoghurt dressing was yummy and apple chutney and burrata has such a smoky flavour with pickled apples.Though I am not a crab lover but fried crab cake with tomato salsa base was quite nice.You will fall in love with crispy roasted suckling pig with savoy cabbage and fondant potatoes were cooked to perfection

We has 2 wonderful meals in this very fine establishment in the past 2 months. After the 2nd visit, I am convinced I need to add this review to my short repertoire of reviews.The ambience: Intimate, cozy and unpretentious. Great for a romantic dinner and also good place to be to hang our with a few friends for the evening, fuss free. Solid choice for the Friday or Saturday dinner with your date or a few close buddies.The food: Simply superior to other restaurants that serve similar fusion of Indo/Malay and European sensibilities. My starter of Tahu Telur was the best I have ever tasted. Delicious peanut sauce over crispy and freshly- fried tofu, topped with crunchy vegetables and crumbs. Simply out of the word. The main of Ayam Penyet was perfectly done , and when paired with high quality jasmine rice and a home made curry gravy, was simply superb . I slurped up every last drop of gravy using each morsel we can find and every last grain of the rice. My partner's Mushroom Risotto was equally impressive and she polished up everything herself, which is unusual, Therefore, I did not try much of it. What is really outstanding are the deserts; both the Crispy Pear and Almond Tart and Kaya & Caramelized Banana Crumble were simply divine. The pastry used for both were light, refined but yet so heavenly. You can figure out that the fruits (pear and banana) used was fresh and painstaking caramelised. The ice-cream pairing thee deserts are up there with the best home-made ones you can find in some of the ice-cream parlours, perhaps the only better one I can thinks of is the one from "Birds of Paradise".The service was excellent. Karl ( chef-owner) gave us the best service we can expect. He was attentive, polite and responsive in the right measures. We enjoyed every course because of his very precise and meaningful explanation of the ingredients and methods that went into the preparation of each dish.Definitely one of the best restaurant experience I had in 2017. This goes up high in my lists of restaurants to revisit

We were there for the lunch set menu and took the 2 course meal. The tahu telor is authentic. For the main, was the steak. Meat was tender. Ambiance is cozy. Will definitely recommend this restaurant. Overall, a must to visit if you are looking for great Indo - Euro cuisine

That was, without doubt a truly exceptional meal and experience..!I travel extensively for work and arrived in Singapore late and stopped in for a last second dinner. It’s near my accommodation and I had no real expectation…. And completely awe struck by the experience.I was warmly greeted by Karl even though it was near closing and offered a menu. This was designed by two chefs one with an hmmm Euro / Australian theme (Karl) and the other Asian / Indonesian (Eugenia).It took me an age to finally pick something as everything needed to be tried. :-)The staff were amazing, very attentive, you know when you look up and they watch to see if you need anything, such a pleasant experience.Karl was outstanding, he offered me a taster of salmon, lime, wasabi and chives… OMG..! The flavours were so amazingly balanced I sat there with my eyes closed enjoying the experience. At some point it occurred to me they might think I was on drugs or something.. lolAs someone who loves to cook and travels extensively I’ve been lucky enough to eat in many top restaurants, including the “elite” where you book over a month in advance and spend exorbitant amounts of money. I also love eating local and experiencing genuine cooking from people who care about what they do. This meal and the obvious passion and dedication by the chefs and staff is beyond anything I’ve experienced.After a lot of internal deliberation I ordered the crispy pork belly and sat back and enjoyed watching the people enjoying finishing their meals and the symphony of staff behind the glass in the kitchen.My meal arrived and I’m lost for words, the skin was delicate and crisp, the pork itself needed no knife, the sauerkraut was incredible… subtle, delicate and not bitter. Finally the potatoes… they had the most incredible texture, perfectly cooked at that point where they were done, but kept body and you could feel the variations in texture. Honestly no words can describe the subtle perfectness of this meal.Without doubt this is the kind of meal and service that will earn a star and I couldn’t be surprised to return and see a menu with prices 5 to 10 times the price.For now if you want to experience an incredible meal and prices that are unreasonably low you will not be disappointed.Unfortunately I fly out in a few days, but intend to eat here every day I can. Can’t wait to try Eugenia’s menu

Among all the restaurants in the area, this one has something for you. The food is the most important part that drags my boyfriend and me to come here more often. Chefs must be very creative and passionate in what they're doing. Always good experience; however the service could be more efficient
3
The ambiance here is nice - it's cozy, warm, with muted wood tones, very comfortable. There is a fair bit of variety, more restrictive on the vegetarian side because of which I settled for a 2-course Set Lunch Menu. The Tofu Omelette was pretty good - the spicy peanut sauce was the highlight - it was flavoursome, spicy, tangy, sweet and thoroughly enjoyable. The main was a Ricotta Gnocchi with Roasted Vegetables & Pesto & Hummus. It looked beautiful but somehow just didn't come together very well
5
I enjoy the Indonesian flavors mingled with European cuisines. Every bite of the oxtail rendang is infused with herbs and full of flavors...it melts in the mouth. I also enjoy the satay which is moist and just perfect! I love the cod fish in banana leaf; it is fragrance. My taste buds come alive dining in this cosy restaurant.
4
Mandatory VD set menu was a surprise...no clue at booking & reconfirmation stages.
H'ever, no disappointment as 5 course set was well conceived, both sight & taste.
Will go back to try their regular menu items.
5
Rare to see 2 chefs working side by side in the same restaurant. The menu is very large and diverse. There were not many people that night (only 4 tables) but i will come back for sure. Well done
5
we booked on a whim, and had a fantastic experience. Great food and service. We will definitely be back another time
5
Great 2nd visit to Table at 7. This time round it was with a larger group of 6 and boy we weren't disappointed. It is said dishing out great food consistently is the greatest skill a chef or in this case chefs strive to attain and the chef's at Table at 7 did it. The king fish carpaccio was excellent. The rendang literally melts in your mouth. Overall a great experience again.
5
This is a perfect restaurant if you have some diners who want western fine dining and others who prefer Indonesian food (presented western style). We had the degustation menu for dinner and every course was delightful. The Balinese barbecued pork ribs and the oxtail rendang (which is their signature dish) were particularly good. Our desserts were chocolate soufflÃ© and banana crumble tart. The latter didn't sound too exciting but we were pleasantly surprised because it was far from a plain boring banana crumble. A crispy thin tart case cradled a coconut custard topped with caramelised bananas and toasted coconut. We polished off every crumb. The food is very good, and definitely worth returning for - particularly since they change their menus every few months so you won't get bored
4
We are regulars at Table @ 7. They have 2 menus, 1 french (by Karl) and 1 indonesian (by Eugenia). Both menus are good! My children always order from the western menu whereas my husband and I prefer ordering from the Indonesian menu. Their food is always consistently good. Ambiance is so-so but if your focus is just the food, you can't go wrong with this choice
5
Lovely flavours, good cutlery and crockery and glassware. Candle lighting. You can see the kitchen from the restaurant. Background music. Artwork on the walls. You can choose all Indonesian or all Western food, or mix and match.High priced by not scarily high priced if you choose the set menu
5
The food, the ambience, the service, everything is fantastic! Definitely one of the tastiest fusion food you can get, here in Singapore. The restaurant is cozy and classy at the same time, making me feel very relaxed even when it was a business.lunch. I was told they normally don't open for lunch but had specially made an exception for our booking for 20.I think it would be a romantic place for dinner too. I would find out for myself as I plan to bring my hubby here next month, to celebrate this birthday

We ordered both starters and mains from the Indonesian menu. We kicked off with the Tahu Telor and the Grilled Seafood. Both dishes were quite nice though they could have been more generous with the sauce on both items. The seafood could have been more succulent - the squid was quite dry. For the mains, we had the Oxtail Rendang and the Grilled Ikan Pepes. The Oxtail Rendang had a rich gravy and the meat was very tender. The Ikan Pepes (cod) was also tasty and well seasoned. The heat factor (chili) was just nice. The rice served with both dishes was well cooked and very fragrant.We decided one plate of Sticky Date Pudding with Vanilla Bean icecream to be shared. It was nice but not outstanding. The portions were moderate. There were three ladies in our parties and we shared these four plates quite nicely. The service was excellent - there were only two tables occupied on the night we were there - so we got full attention from the head waiter. The ambience was pleasant. In conclusion I would say that though the food and service were good, we will not be returning any time soon because the prices were pretty astronomical. We spent almost $200 without any drinks except a cup of coffee which works out to $60+ per head. Much too much!

I find it rare to find an Owner / Operated restaurant that is of this high quality. How unique to have high caliber "Austrian" / European cuisine, partnered with Indonesian food of a true international-scale. This restaurant serves up MAGIC! I was so proud to bring very sophisticated Singapore friends to TABLE@7, and they were totally satisfied! I will be back soon to Table@7. Try the BABI GULING Roasted Pork...that's really special
5
Very apt name considering the address and the time most Singaporeans have dinner!
We had a school class reunion here, and the food and service were very good.
5
Just wanted to try this restaurant quite a few time !!
Aparently !!
I just visit !!
Very good fusion cuisine !!
I like the indo french beef !! With muje flavour ful rice !!
All great !!

Had dinner with couple of friends for dinner on weekday night. We had a table of 5, and the restaurant happened to be hosting a large group of 14 besides us. There were two other tables, probably the waiting staff had to cope with the crowd. The food was good, but the staff couldn't handle the wines that we brought along and despite asking them to open a bottle to be aired three times, I had to go to the counter to get them to open it directly. Dessert was special, as some of us asked for extra kaya that came with one of the dessert, and Eugenia served us Kaya Toast
5
A very memorable dinner in a cosy yet stylish small restaurant with superb service. Chefs Karl (French) and Eugenia (Indonesian) are so talented and whip up impeccable dishes. White asparagus cappuccino, carpaccio of scallop with truffle soy dressing, white asparagus cheese tartlet with crispy ham were amazing. The pan seared quail is the best preparation of quail that I've had! For the main, the Indonesian Wagyu oxtail rendang was perfect - tender and aromatic. It's a house special that must be tried. The fusion banana crumble with kaya and fresh coconut ice cream ensured we will be going back for more!Highly recommended.
5
The restaurant seems to have two sides to it for its two founders and chefs (a couple). Bringing different styles of cuisine together, the european and malaysian food mixes very well together and creates a unique environment.I loved the food - everything was super tasty. It was also pretty romantic/intimate, so I would strongly recommend for a date. It is a little out of the way, but was worth the (minor) trip
5
It was recommended that I try this restaurant as the concept was so unique. Two head chefs with completely different cuisines. Karl and Eugenis have struck gold. Karl is German with a European menu while Eugenis is Indonesian. As you peruse the menu your are treated to Two entries options and two main course options. The food here is fresh with the finest ingredients and a passion that shows at every level. Karl fresh smokes trout weekly and serves it with a slight wasabi drizzle, wonderful. I chose the fresh grilled octopus salad followed by the crispy skin sea base.......heaven. The wine list is extensive and very reasonably priced. I chose a 2001 Chianti that was expertly de cantered and became better as my meal was served. Karl served the food himself allowing a warm interaction with the cef and Eugenis visited the table to chat.. Service was excellent, attentive without being intrusive. This was the best experience Singapore offered and I dined in some very upscale establishments on my visit. do Not miss this opportunity if you're visiting Singapore you'll thank yourself
5
When we came, the place was practically empty which is a real downer on the atmosphere. Why it was empty I really don't know. Service was excellent - I ordered the degustation menu and was changing little things here and there and they were obliging. The food was out of the world. It started with the bread - the balsamic vinegar was not normal but this sweet sauce in olive oil. We ordered the degustation menu which is 5 courses at $98. The food is like Indonesian food in western style which makes it a different interpretation of the food influences in this region. I think Indonesian food tends to be sweet so the western interpretations are slightly sweeter than before. Also, the first dish which was the scallop carpaccio was delicious - I think the light truffle soy dressing made this scallop carpaccio a dish to remember.
5
Enjoyed a really lovely dinner here yesterday. The squid and prawns starter was delightful. The food was tasteful and prepared just right. Our party of 5 shared 4 appetisers, 4mains and 3 desserts to enjoy a fabulous of taste without feeling stuffed. The red wine recommended the staff was appreciated by all. We especially enjoyed the ox-tail Redang and cod wrapped in leave. The desserts were marvellous. Very good value compared to some other I have eaten in Singapore.
5
Table at 7 has been the favourite restaurant for us and I mean THE favourite, not just A favourite. We found ourselves back time after time, celebrating various special occasions. It has a wonderful atmosphere, warm service and fabulous food. Karl and Eugenia has created the ideal balance between the fine dining French and hearty local.On Karl's menu, the foie gras changed my mind on fruit compote, i fell in love with preserved fruits. The carpaccio of sea scallops were fresh and beautifully seasoned. The lobster and vongole linguine was perfectly executed without being too heavy. I don't like suckling pig...but this was amazing. On Eugenia's menu, how could anyone ever forget her beef rendang and her homemade kaya. The dessert menu..lets just say, you won't know which one to pick....Best of it, for quality, its value for money
4
Taken here by friends, with all of us on our first visit.The welcome was warm, and the food very good. Beef cheek attracted my attention and was excellent, as was the Rendang to follow.The wine list is extensive and of high quality, and the price seemed appropriate given everything else.Well worth a visit
4
Nice ambience and decent menu. Had the lamb shank which was pretty good but reckoned lack of accompanying veges n mash. Thursday night is great with live music and where one can sing with the musicians....real cool. Wonderful evening experience overall.
5
Had the porcini and gruyere cheese soufflé, magret de canard, lamb shank and grand manier soufflé. All extremely good except the grand manier soufflé. The duck and lamb were excellent.
Good value for money in the Singapore context (malheursement).
3
Ambience - very good. Cosy environment. Service - not exceptional but staff tried their best
Food - delicious but not exceeding my expectations especially for prices paid
Overall rating : 3.5/5
Unlikely to visit again

We came here for restaurant week, having dined here before and found it very good.We were slightly less impressed this time. I had the suckling pig, which I thought was pretty good. Not excellent but very good.My partner however, had the Wagyu Rendang and she thought is was very average. As she is Indonesian, it's a dish she has had many times before. It's not that she thought it was bad, rather, it was not as special as it should have been, given the price of this restaurant
5
Great food. You get the best of asian and european here. We got the perfect soufflé, crispy pork skin, beautiful poached egg with hollandaise, melt in your mouth braised beef cheeks, aromatic grilled seafood.Will sure to come back when visiting Singapore again. Karl and Eugenia, thank you.
5
This was our second visit, following up from a wonderful lunch. This time, we were 2 couples.We ordered the WGS degustation. 2 in the party did not like something specific in the degustation, and breaking all the rules, Table@7 allowed us to swap out to an alternative.The wine pairing was excellent and the food superb. We're already planning a return, with a few more couples
5
My first experience here was over restaurant week Mar 2014. The fix price set dinner menu was creatively executed and absolutely delicious. The fusion of Western and Balinese cuisine was excellent. The wait staff were pleasant and attentive and ambience was attractive. We will definitely dine here again. There is also a private room within the restaurant for a special function. They also entertain outside catering. Best of all the starter, soup, main course and dessert was priced at S$55++ per person. Must try
4
$30++ for the set lunch. Choice of 3 for starter, main and dessert. I had the salad, the red emperor fish and the sticky date pudding. All were very decent. Service was good (possibly as a consequence of there not being very many people in the restaurant). Total bill for 2 people including taxes etc was just over $70
3
Appetizer 1 was a seafood salad and Appetizer 2 was a porcini risotto. Both were pretty standard, then came a mushroom soup. We ordered a medium rare black angus ribeye that was seared to perfection, followed by a vanilla soufflé that was just so-so. Overall the kitchen nailed the technical details of each component but the dishes as a whole lacked finesse. Not much thought was put into how the individual ingredients would complement each other on the palate and plating was elementary. I would not come back here again
4
We had a lovely meal here, although they rushed us. When we explained that we like to enjoy our meal with time BTW courses, they understood and apologized. They offered a cheese platter to compensate. Well done for listening. Wine list was very good. It's also nice that it is away from all the tourists. We lived locally for three months and it was a nice find
5
What a great little restaurant this is. You have a choice of an Indonesia style menu and a European menu. The food is delicious. The staff really make you feel at home. Excellent wine list. Well worth the visit.
4
I experimented Table at 7 during the last Restaurant Week in Singapore and was amazed by the diner-course. There are two chefs at the restaurant and the menu is a combination of Modern European dishes and Fusion Indonesian ones. Surprising and very good!
4
We had a lovely birthday dinner here on Friday night - my husband and I had the degustation menu - $98++ per person - absolutely lovely food - wine list s extensive and pricey but that's Singapore! We will be back.
4
Went to lunch, 3 guys, with the ability to not return for work.We had the set lunch, with all dishes supurb, mixing between us so we got to taste the choices.They have a good selection of wines and I would have given 5 rating if only they had not recommended some wines which they were already out of stock. So my 4 here is really a 4.5
1
We are slowly discovering good places to eat in Singapore and on a walk up Mohamed Sultan Road went in to sample the food by having lunch, at about 2.10--the notice on the door said lunch till 2.30 and it said Open. I'm not sure if I didn't fit the waitresses expectations but she was less than enthusiastic when I said I would like to book a table and have some lunch.She told me that they had to prepare for a function and I couldn't have lunch, and when I pointed out to her that it said Open on the door and it was only 2.10, she simply didn't care. So, I said I would like to book a table for Friday evening, and she asked me for my telephone number and said she would check the on-line, and telephone bookings and ring me to let me know. I asked why I couldn't book then and she said she had to gather all the bookings in and decide, then she would ring me in a short while.I thought that was very odd, but went along with it,.At 7.00 that evening I rang back and she seemed to have forgotten all about it, but told me I could have a table. Later that evening the owner, or someone in authority rang me and asked if we were going, and, as I was thoroughly fed up by this time, said No. She apologised and said she would ring me later, but didn't. So, I rather suppose we will not be tasting the food at Table at 7, any time soon
5
An unusual combination of authentic Indonesia food and a good selection of continental delicacies. The cream of mushroom soup with truffle oil and a light crisp bread was delectable. The desserts must not be missed - sticky toffee pudding with butterscotch sauce, pineapple tartlet with a gula Melaka sauce and ice-cream were perfect.
5
We gave Table @ 7 our first try during Singapore Restaurant Week, so had the special menu set for that. The menu is best described as European-Indonesian fusion: some dishes are more European, others more Indonesian (a few more broadly Asian), and some pull equally from both culinary heritages. But for me the concept is less important than the taste experience. We were both very impressed indeed at combination of flavours and the way the dishes were put together. Full marks for the quality of the dishes. Indeed the sticky toffee pudding was even better than Marks & Spencer's version - which may sound like an insulting comparison but is actually very high praise (you need to know that M&S Sticky Toffee Pudding is very hard to better!).Other things. Service was slick. House wines by the glass were good, and reasonably priced (not cheap, but good value). Presentation was superb. And the portion size was absolutely perfect (everything was served in exactly the right amount - not too little, not too much) so that at the overall experience was paced beautifully (ie. we weren't left hungry, and equally we didn't struggle to find space for the gorgeous dessert).Excellent food, you will struggle to get much better in Singapore regardless of price. And hence exceptional value at the Restaurant Week price, and I would say well worth it even at the a la carte prices.Will certainly be going again soon. A big thanks to Karl and Eugenia!! Highly recommended
5
I dined here for the first time during Restaurant Week and would say that it was my most enjoyable meal of all the meals I had in Restaurant Week. I enjoyed it more than even the fancier Salt Grill. Like someone pointed out, the lighting was a little dim but if you like romantic, I suppose this would then be perfect. The food and service were excellent though. First, the food. The soto soup was very good, and the beef cheeks with buah keluak were fantastic. I didn't want the sorbet that came with the Restaurant Week set n asked for something else and they gave me an out of this world sticky date pudding- my favourite! No nonsense about not being able to change the set menu or having to pay extra etc. Service was very polite and accommodating without being intrusive. I called to change my booking twice and there was no sign of impatience at the end of the line. I'll definitely be back!
4
My wife and I have never dined at Table at 7 so we were both looking forward to having lunch here during Singapore Restaurant Week. The ambiance is lovely - a modern restaurant that has simple, yet hip decor. They could use a bit more lighting though, because it was a bit dark where we were seated. The hostess was very nice and knowledgeable - she gave us good recommendations and explained the menu diligently. The wait staff were very attentive and courteous. The food was a good mix of western and indonesia cuisine. Lots of great flavors - especially the beef cheeks and the soto ayam. And the fish was seared properly and seasoned to perfection. Overall, a really nice experience and worth the visit

Nice place. Very good service. Excellent sommelier. Good Austrian chef and elegant, Indonesian co-owner, adding some spice to the dishes. Unfortunately neither she, nor the chef, remembered us two weeks after we attended an pretty interesting wine dinner there. Good to excellent starters and main dishes but then... S$ 15 ++ for a warm, eagerly awaited, apple pie with a diameter of 5.5 cm... Come on! Was I dreaming? Was I back in my home country visiting Madurodam, the miniature city in The Hague? Take a look at the photo. It shows the apple pie, accompanied by a spoon. And, trust me, this spoon wasn't 'table spoon' size. A complete disgrace that makes you forget all the good things about this charming restaurant
