Good restaurant which serves nice breakfast buffet. cannot accommodate large crowds. Its more specifically for guests in IBIS Novena hotel. Breakfast buffet is filling with live counter. You also get lunch, dinner & all-day dining options.

Very limited dishes in menu.
Their breakfast was good.
I ordered margarita pizza & they served disgusting.

Good prices, especially if you have a food & beverage discount voucher from the hotel. The food is tasty even if limited in range. They do not serve any pork products, which makes sense given the audience, but was disappointing for me as I missed bacon in the mornings. I wouldn'y only eat here if I wasn't staying at the hotel, but if I was staying at the hotel, I'd definitely eat here

This restaurant is insisde the Ibis Novena Hotel. I have eaten here 3 days in a row, different menus. All were great and tasty, glass of wine is also very affordable and good in taste. The best about it: the courteous and professional service by the charming young staff. May I please commend these three people for attention to the manager:SeheeJolinAstridThey have been wonderful, I enjoyed my time, the excellence of the food and the nice company.Thank you, OOPENMariana Ama

We (10 of us) had our lunch at the cafe and we're amazed by the hospitality and attentiveness of the staff team particularly Jolin. Thumbs up to her ! She remembered all our names after taking our orders. Served with patience and SMILE are lacking in most cafes and restaurants but not in Oopen Cafe. Pizza and pasta served were delicious and the price was definitely very reasonable when we ordered their set menu with choice of Soup, Salad or Dessert. A conducive cafe ideal for group lunch served by well trained staff team.

Could put more side dish options on the menu.Pomodoro pasta did not have any ingredients in it, just sauce. Maybe could put mushrooms etc. in it?Ambience and service was good

I booked a table for 11 pax at OOpen. We were late but the lady, Jolin, got our table nicely ready when we arrived. She is most helpful.Food is good & cheap (set meal only $10++). Total bill came up to ~S$127 for 11 pax, cheapest family lunch ever!Ambience is friendly (clean & spacious). We enjoyed our chit chat, food and staff are all friendly, especially Jolin. She is extremely helpful, provided me with alot of useful/helpful info. She made our lunch get together really easy & wonderful.Added bonus: Free parking coupon.Minus point: Limited drinks & dessert menu.Overall: Very happy, definitely will go back there

Thumbs-up of the following:1.) Tasty Breakfast throughout numerous stays. 2.) Attentive Management & Efficient Services by Staffs. ***However, the room temperature of the Oopen Pasta restaurant needs to be decreased. Otherwise, it's not favorable to hold a long session of meeting with some alcoholic beverages + dinner session.Hope to have the air-conditioning system running strong in our upcoming stay

Dropped in for dinner. Food was average. Requested the pumpkin soup, just before serving was told it was spoilt. Had to change soup to Salmon chowder. The mushroom soup was the better of the two. Mains was salmon and sirloin. The salmon was very nice. The sirloin was tough. Dessert apple crumble with Ice cream and the second was Black Forest. Black Forest was so so, and when the apple crumble arrived I was told chef decided to change it at last second to mixed fruits and ice cream. This we rejected. They gave a chocolate cake slice as an apology. It was nice.

Meals prepared by Oona exceeded our expectation. We enjoyed our meals there the 3 times we visited. Service was also good, special thanks to Jian.
5
Simple and good food, very good price for what you get. Ambience could be better so don't take your date here, but recommended for dinner with family. Friendly to kids too.
5
The staff (especially Jolin) are so helpful, considerate and friendly. We had chicken curry, which was delicious. Great food and service!

Quite pricey and the food is not that great. Not much selections as well. We did not like the food at all.

Was invited to buffet breakfast by a friend staying at the hotel. It turned out to be a poor choice. The selection of food and beverage, service and atmosphere felt like an afterthought for $17 per person. The atmosphere was akin to a food market with droves of tour group and FIT guests trying to get a seat. That translated into a jostling at the buffet line with guests trying to wiggle for plates and food. The lack of seating also meant guests requesting to share tables. Any intent to catch up over an enjoyable breakfast was out the door. The food presentation was unattractive and the quality was poor. For example, the croissant looked and tasted dense, hash browns were over fried and salty, and the coconut rice tasted much like steamed rice. The only saving grace were the eggs cooked to order by the young cook trying to keep smiling and courteous while struggling to fulfill orders and refill chafers.The service staff were diligent but clueless in managing the breakfast overrun. The overflow of guests meant a higher turnover of cutlery, food and beverages. We noticed other non-restaurant staff coming to the rescue. This entire scene should have been avoided by issuing dining sessions with advanced knowledge of occupancy and amounts of pre-purchased breakfast. This is often practiced with large tour groups. Breakfast would have been more enjoyable at one of the Zhong Shan food venues just opposite the hotel.

Breakfast buffet, you can eat many normal food (usual food) such as Asian Breafast with rice, eggs, fried noodles, vegestarian food (best choice is dumplings with chocolate, green beans...),...Western & American Breakfast as bread, sanwich, jam (grape, apple, peanut, green tea...), croissant, beans...Indian & Chinese food (curry,...), drink (milo, coffee, water, apple juice, orange juice). After the breakfast, i came to the restaurant for both lunch and dinner with seafood spaghetti and Capuccino. The server are friendly, kind and helpful. The space is wide, clean and okey for take viewing outside. Price is not very expensive, you can take the spaghetti with 14 to 20 SGD included tax

Had a family dinner here for 6 adults.Pleasant find as there was a good variety of western, italian and Asian delights to choose. The korean fried chicken was unusual as the sauce is not instant mix. We ordered 1 serving of korean fried wings and wanted more. When the second sefving came, we discovered that the tanginess of both sauces differ slightly. But we are more than happy to know that we are served fresh sauces and wings!Great value, open and spacious, not too crowded. Good for family gatherings! Oh plus convenient location is a plus point too

Service is great, food not so great. My family are Accor members so we used our membership discounts twice for dinner. First night we had sirloin beef that was a very poor cut of beef. Second night pasta and burger, that was better but still marginal. The service is excellent and both Astrid and Farah are diamonds in the rough. They are courteous and happy and make the experience for service very good

Decided to have dinner at Oopen despite the rows of wonderful food dished along Balestier road. This place is an amazing find. Tucked away in a corner off Balestier road; in Ibis Novena Hotel. We ordered the Lamb shank and the NZ grilled steak. The Lamb shank was first class. Tender, juicy, with the flavours at the right mix. Likewise, the steak is served better than Outback or other steak-specialty restaurants. This place is the perfect find. Ambience is good.
4
The place is quiet, cappuccino ($5) is good. Tempura fish & chips is good too. Reasonable portion with chips and coleslaw ($14). I also tried the aglio olio ($8) which is ok. Currently have promotion for dinner 1 for 1 main course if you pay by uob credit card
5
the variety shared in the restaurant was really great and that added to the positive experience that we had during the stay in the hotel.

Gr8 service, nice food, good ambience, nice location. Gr8 place to eat. Try for their days special. Its really nice grill and pastas.

I tried Oopen Pasta & Grill twice (breakfast buffet). The spread was just ok but the fresh orange juice was very nice. I refilled for like five times. And I'm not even a "juice person".
5
We stayed at Ibis Novena where the restaurant is located. Friendly staff. Convenient and good value especially if you have an Accor card.
4
The menu have a good variety of specialties and all are very good, the environment is very nice and comfortable, it seems to be at home. The service is very very good, people smiling and always ready for your need.

The place is attached to the Ibis hotel and serves breakfast for the hotel guests. The breakfast spread is decent and the taste was good. The seating area was little cluttered with more people than what the place can accommodate. The breads were goof and also the dry fruits were also on offer along with breakfast. For 18 SGD the breakfast spread could be little more richer. All in all, a good choice as long as it is not crowded
4
Only go for the buffet when it's free for you to do so, otherwise it's not really worth being charged at $17 per person considering there is a very small selection of food available every morning. The choices don't vary by much with baked red beans, scrambled eggs and hash browns, along with muffins and croissants that are never off the menuOmelette hand made by the chef upon order is often very tasty.Staff are friendly but food wise, you're better off eating elsewhere

This restaurant is right next to my house and in the last 1.5 years I have passed it daily....sometimes many times a day. Every time I saw people relaxing, eating or just sitting there.....I always thought I must try the place someday. Finally today I felt like a pasta so I went there with my wife. We sat inside because even though there was breeze outside it was quite hot....the ambience is superb. One of the sections was closed as the tables had not been done up. I was surprised they actually said that to me.One glance at the menu confirmed my suspicion....that while we had come intending to eat pasta we would end up eating something else. It offers a good selection of Chinese, western, Japanese and Mexican fare.....we decided to try Quesadilla, Curry chicken and a BBQ pizza. The size of the portion scared us. Each dish was quite huge and truly value for money. The staff members on duty were only 2 so sometimes there was a delay in attending to us. But service was good and attitudes very helpful.We could not finish the food and it was sad to leave some on the plates.The bill was the best part. Not only did my DBSs credit card get me a 15% discount under the DBS Indulge promotion, but I realised that the prices on the menu included the VAT and service charge. 3 dishes in 40 bucks with no drinks in such good ambience is really great.I must mention that the food tasted very good too. It wasn't just a casually done up meal but we'll cooked and served.I am definitely going to return for their buffet breakfast or lunch options

As is the norm for hotels, Ibis Singapore Novena Hotel comes with its own restaurant cum cafe with the curious name of OOpen. Guests of the hotel for the night could enjoy 2 complimentary breakfasts, so off we went to grab our breakfast in the cafe situated at a side off the lobby.Just as it is with the rooms, lateral space is at a premium but furniture is spaced at a comfortable distance to allow customers to navigate to their seats as well as affording a bubble of privacy. The small restaurant yet comfortable cafe faces the corner of a junction, giving diners a main view of the usually quiet Irrawaddy Road as well as a side view of the hustle and bustle of the major road that is Ballestier Road. Wide window panes allow a sense of airiness within whatever limited space Oopen could afford.Oopen's variety in breakfast may not score points with me but I am not complaining as the taste itself is enough to keep me going for more. Guests could opt to enjoy a Western style breakfast complemented by self-serviced toasts with assorted jams, assorted Danish pastries or a meat-filled plate of sausages and bacon in the company of scrambled eggs, or just go all out on rice served with curry chicken, the oriental and local way to start the day. Not that we really do that for breakfasts... One should not forget the platters of fruit for a healthy dietary habit.One does not simply go about his day without his share of black coffee, cappuccino or latte. I do not like my coffee bitter, and fortunately again for me, the offered latte has just enough milk in it to sweeten the beverage yet retaining the taste of coffee. Talk about the coffee lover who doesn't love the bitter of the coffee..

Had the good fortune to be treated out to dinner here, and it was a good experience. The restaurant is adjacent to the Ibis Hotel (Novena area) and may be missed if you aren't specifically looking for it.The service is good, especially by SG standards. The cuisine is truly international: American, European, Asian. Almost everything was within the 8-12 SD range, and some beers were on promo as well (Heineken on our night, at SD 20 for 3 bottles, not bad considering the same beer would cost maybe SD 9 each along Sentosa/ other chicer locations).Appetizers: spring rolls, vegetable samosa, chicken pieces with gravy and the Incredible Marmite Chicken (must order!), a salty, sweet, crisp-yet-tender and tangy treat. Main Course: order any of the Korean dishes, you can't go wrong. Pasta/ Noodles: Truffle Cream Pasta is the hands-down winner here. Followed closely by the Hokkien Mee. Maybe skip the Char Kway Teow (such huge servings tend to overwhelm the palate when there are strong or one-dimensional flavors).We skipped dessert as we had to walk off all the food we ate (above list of what we ordered/ate is by no means complete).Drop by with friends when you have a chance, the atmosphere is perfect for family or a get-together
