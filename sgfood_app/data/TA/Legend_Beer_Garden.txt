My family usually eats at Legend after our kids' roller-blading lesson on Sunday evenings. We like the Western food, especially the Spaghetti Carbonara, the Seafood Spaghetti Marinara and the thin-crust seafood pizza!

We came down around 5.30pm on a Friday evening and easily secured a table since it wasn't very crowded yet. Currently, they are having a weekend 1-for-1 promotion on its house beer, Legend beer lasting all the way till November.Food-wise, we did not order much. Nothing special about the calamari; it tasted the normal. The Hokkien mee tasted strange; definitely can get better fare at a legit hawker centre or coffee shop instead. The carbonara tasted good; it was rich and savory and it came with a complementary poached egg. The assorted sausages were probably the best tasting dish we ordered. A hearty serving of pork and chicken sausages. Though all tasted good, the pork sausages were extremely juicy and biting into it guarantees a spurt of juices into your mouth canal so take note if it's hot.Drinks-wise, the reason why we came here was because of the beer promotion. We ordered two two-litre towers of Legend light beer. It was a rather light-bodied beer. I couldn't pick up any fruity or flowery tones, so it leaned more towards a malty taste. It was very foamy but not gassy. The aftertaste was crisp and refreshing. It was light on the stomach and easy on the palette; a great choice to pair with food. This place sells other drinks but their beer is the highlight.Place-wise, they have an outdoor and indoor dining area. If the weather isn't too sweltering hot and you aren't too bothered by mosquitoes, the outdoor area would be a better choice since it's more breezy in the evenings and night. If not, the indoor area would be a better choice. They seem to have live bands (local. budding music groups) that play occasionally in the evenings to boost the atmosphere. The overall ambience was more suited for a gathering of friends rather than family since the place can get really loud with the crowd and the live band playing in the background.However, there is a major flaw to this place. I mentioned arriving at 5.30pm and the place is relatively empty. The crowd starts picking up fast and by the time it reaches about 7.30pm, the place is fully packed with a long line of people waiting for seats. While reserving a table can circumvent the waiting for a table issue, the queue times to order food and drinks becomes so ridiculously long that it can take beyond an hour to even reach the counter to order drinks or for your food to be ready for collection. With such a large crowd size, unbelievably cheap beer and mainly an under-staffing issue, if you arrive too late, be prepared to queue or wait very long just to order drinks or collect your food. I'm not sure about the crowd size on a weekday but I personally would advise dropping by this place at 5.30pm-6.00pm to beat the crowd. Order what you intend or want to drink and eat in one go and just sit there and enjoy the atmosphere till you leave. A second order would be difficult, considering the queue times.Recently, this place has posted quite a number of promotions on its Facebook page. If visiting this place, it may be worthwhile to check it out before coming here

We came during Sunday lunch hour. The place was quite empty, only the Western and drink stall were open. Ordered Hawaiian pizza, chicken schnitzel and grilled cajun chicken. Price was alright, taste okay - nothing to shout about. Liked the ambience, decoration, and outdoor seating area

This place is a nice place to chillax over some craft beer and grub, and is especially crowded on weekends. They show Football on a few big screen TVs mounted facing the outdoor area, so come EPL season, you know where to head down for cheap beers and free footie. The current deal for beers is 3 half pints for $10 net. That's pretty much 3 pints for $20.... pretty cheap with the prices these days in SG. The beer is from Starkers!PLACEThe ambience was pretty all right. They have an indoor area, but the outdoor area is where you wanna be. It's breezy and right next to the park connector. Apparently they have live music on the weekend (I can't say for sure because I haven't been there on a weekend).FOODThe food was a hit and miss. I ordered the mixed meat platter and expected it to be awesome. It looked a 5/5 but tasted like a 1. The beef was rock hard, and everything kind of tasted the same. The breaded fish and chips though was very well cooked, crispy on the outside and nice and flaky on the inside. The pizza? Don't bother. The best thing was the clams in spicy white wine sauce... that was FANTASTIC. They should really make that with pasta, it'll be Super good. I saw someone next to us order the other platter (seafood and wings); it looked way better than the meat one,so maybe you'd wanna go for that. They also have Chinese cuisine (like a one-plate black pepper beef with rice and bullseye egg) that looks good.They only make steaks medium well and well done, so go figure. Probably frozen and thawed. This place is what it is. It really reminds me of Hans, but with beer. OVERALLI'd go there with the lads for beers, and it's Super casual with family too. Not sure if I'd go there again, maybe to try the Chinese food instead

KT, Michael and I cycle each Thursday fro 3.45pm from Bishan where we start via AMK Ave 5 to Punggol. We have made it a point to stop by Legend Beer Garden either for coffee and toast but of late because of the offer, we have been indulging in the $2.00 beer - white and black. Service has been good especially from the young lady

What a pleasant surprise! It's our nth time coming here for our chill out time. We love the generous twin tower craft beers and honestly priced good food. This visit, we realized there are now in house entertainment. Not sure what's their name, but the girl really sang well. The best thing is she is bilingual! Chinese songs, English songs, funky, ballads, she put up a wonderful performance, not to mention the skillful guitarist who was providing the musicPrice wise, this neighborhood beer garden is faithful to heartlanders. No overpriced items. Good for all beer lovers

Visited today for dinner and was delighted to find a new Western stall had taken over the previous stall. Allegra is the name of the new stall and it offers this Meat Lover platter for 2 at $24.80 that consists of lamb chop, chicken chop, pork chop, cheese sausage, mashed potatoes, saurkrat, fried egg and a tasteless sausage. Lol.The meal was satisfying, chicken was crispy and juicy, lamb chop juicy and slightly salty, pork chop a tad porky. Cheese sausage was nice. The tasteless sausage was tasteless and strange. This was the only item I didn't enjoy.Took about 10 to 15minutes to prepare for this dish
