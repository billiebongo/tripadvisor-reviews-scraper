I was stayed at Albert court hotel for 2 week. The breakfast provided by Albert cafe is very good. It contains multiple option and the way of welcoming guest is very good. I highly recommend this place.

We had breakfast here every day when we stayed and one evening meal.
Food was good with three courses and service also good.
We did not need to pre-book and enjoyed the set menu which included coffee afterwards.

good breakfast fare, could add some more indian dishes as variety for in indians specially, service is good
5
Worth the buck for continental food. Bought buffet breakfast at Village hotel. Good chicken varieties.
4
Breakfast is good because it is convenient. More dishes can be added. Lunch and dinner are not well patronized because it is pricey, service is not very good and choices limited. Excellent restaurants just outside the front door.

I bought from Fave, a coupon for hightea for 2. Made a reservation weeks ago for 5 Aug 2017. I received a call from the cafe supervisor on 3aug evening that since I was the only customer (Ã—2, plus my daughter) with reservation, the cafe cannot confirm my reservation because they cannot whip out the spread just for the 2 of us! He gave me dates on when to go, specific dates . But those are dates i have prior commitments. In the end, i have to reschedule my other commitments just to free up my time on the date convenient to the cafe to have my hightea there. I haven't been there yet. Not sure how's the quality of food n service but the experience is already spoil and i doubt i will enjoy it in any case.

We had the High Tea buffet here, using a very well-priced Groupon voucher. Bad mistake. The hotel is beautifully appointed, oozing ambience and mod cons in a refurbished colonial architectural style. The dining space has too many chairs and is very crowded, making it difficult to make your way to the buffet tables when the dining area is full. Now for the food - I would rate this aspect -1/5. Very limited variety of poor quality hot food: fried chicken wings and drumlettes, mini spring rolls, sotong balls, vege kway teow (with only noodles and a few vege leaves tossed in, nothing else). After eating these, the aftertaste of stale oil lingered in my mouth. There was also congee with DIY accompaniments, cold meats and cheese platter, limited salad bar and fruit platter, a small selection of mini croissants and muffins and sad cake slices and point sandwiches. This was the most dismal high tea I've ever had, and I left with the lingering taste of oiliness and bitter disappointment. Apart from the ambience, the only culinary positive was the filtered coffee, which helped combat the oily aftertaste. Service was average, with a focus on clearing away plates and ensuring patrons had valid coupons and did not overstay the designated time. Overall, there is plenty of room for improvement

I had the morning buffet breakfast, which I say was sumptuous and a needed convenience if you are on a work visit. The hotel caters to travelers of multiple nationalities ...and so one will find atleast one dish catering to the south Asian, Indian and continental tastes. The live omelette station was really good, busy but efficient in it's service. And for the gluten free , one can always find the two fruit options. The staff was friendly as well. Overall a decent experience, for the value (around 20 SGD) paid

We ate here twice during our 4 nights & found the food very good & plentiful. It was not really expensive & the service was excellent.

I ate here for breakfast a number of times and it is pretty much a stock standard breakfast you get at most places around the world.
Is it worth the 18 dollar price tag a day, not really in my opinion.

Albert Cafe is the only in-house dining option at the Village Hotel Albert Court. It has a good choice of Asian and Western cuisine, at mid-range prices. Quaint, somewhat old-style furniture. A bit congested during buffet breakfasts.
4
Had a late supper and breakfast here. Both were excellent value and the food was good. Service was goods too.
5
The café is well placed and has good food options, it surely meets your need, no matter where are you from
3
basic fair, too many tables makes it difficult to relax, cultural allowances means no Bacon or Beef.
5
Nice food with great taste. I really enjoy all the food here, western to Indian food. The price also affordable.
4
A very beautiful cafe decorated in a very classy way... serves a vairety of food each with their unique taste...

Breakfast spread was adequate though the choice was limited.
It gives value for money and so quite good that way. The service is very good and courteous.
4
The breakfast is of good quality though lacking some of the more common western breakfast options (bacon for example) but there are asian food aditions to add choice. The food options however change only slightly from day to day (hash browns for wedges for example). The evening meals are of better quality and reasonably priced. If you're staying at the hotel as we were then this is a quick and easy alternative to dining out
5
The breakfast spread on the offer was really very good. Service is very efficient. The place is very good for a quick breakfast.

Average run-of the-mill hotel restaurant. Good food, well cooked with efficient and attentive service. Lacks atmosphere for a special occasion but otherwise, well worth trying.
5
The restaurant is part of the Albert Court Village Hotel. They serve some real nice food. Quality and Quantity were great
5
Good food, so good, in fact, that we ate there every day including breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff as well.
4
The cafe is part of the hotel too and is good. the food served is as per the people staying at the hotel
5
A lovely restaurant located in a beautiful courtyard atmosphere. Good service, food quality and decent prices

I had breakfast here each morning that I stayed at the hotel, and the buffet is great value for money. The breakfast offers a nice selection of American and Asian food, with fruit, juices and coffee to compliment. Service is good, and the staff is very friendly

Service was excellent; food on menu looked appetizing, but we opted for the three course special set menu for about $26.00We had lovely minestrone soup, and I had pork ribs which were so tender, it just came easily off the bone. My husband had a salmon steak which he enjoyed.The only downside was the salad could have been garnishe'd a bit more; only one slice of tomato and no dressing nor oil. Also, wasn't expecting service and other charges

I don't know how there could be positive reviews from the other reviewers.Let me be brief. There were only 4 trays of warm food. Yes, 4 trays.There are some fruits and pastries on the side.That was the entire selection of food.A house party has more variety of food than this buffet, located in a hotel no less

We came to this place after purchasing some vouchers for High Tea. Glad we didn't pay full price as the selection was limited across food and drinks. The setting is nice, above the hotel lobby and has an old-rustic feel about it. The only thing my family rated highly was the crispy chicken, the rest was pretty average
