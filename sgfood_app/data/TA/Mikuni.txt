This restaurant has always been our favourite go to place for fresh and good Japanese food especially the wagyu beef and sashimi.
4
Though a Korean Chef but the dishes he whips up are very authentically Japanese with good techniques and masterful skills in cutting and flavours. Must try is the carpaccio dishes awestruck
4
Always impresses since the days when it was known as Inagiku. Chef Eric is the icon of this restaurant.

Really very unexpected, service was very bad, unwelcome arrival, staff were all very unobservant also, ambience was too dark.

Fantastic birthday dinner with my husband. Absolutely delicious Japanese food that is worth the price and calories. We savoured the food and will be back to visit. Restuarant gave a surprise complimentary green tea ice cream with candle for my birthday.

Yet another amazing dinner experience at Mikuni. We had the winter special but chose to be seated by the Teppanyaki counter. I wish I wrote this review sooner as I would have a better description of each dish. Hope the photos help.
5
This is my 4th time dining at Mikuni and my 1st time writing a review. As always, the food impresses. I had the $120 premium Miyabi lunch set on previous occasions, and this time round, I had the $80 teppanyaki lunch set. We were ably served by Victorine and her colleague (whose name I have forgotten, apologies), who answered the questions we had about our food, and were kind enough to accommodate tweaks to the set menu based on our dietary requirements. Even though we stayed till late chatting away (and delayed the staff's breaktime), the staff were still all smiles and remained professional. We will be back
5
We sat around the tepanyaki counter and ordered the lunch set. The staff were lovely and answered all of our questions regarding the food and sauces. The portions were very generous and all the food was wonderful - BEST STEAK OF MY LIFE. We really enjoyed interacting with the chef and he told us all about his cooking, I was even allowed to have a turn on the hot plate. Overall we had a beautiful meal and a once in a lifetime experience 
5
This was my first time at Mikuni and I wasn't disappointed. We were met at the entrance and promptly greeted and urshered to our seats. Our pretty and pleasant service staff welcomed us and quickly offered us a drinks menu and food menu. We decided to have hot green tea and one of their set menus. We added more later. The ambience was nice and pleasant and not too noisy eventhough the restaurant was quite full. Service was prompt but not too intrusive. She was knowedgeable about the restaurants offerings and was able to recommend food to us intelligently. We especially enjoyed the fois gras and sahsimi dishes. We also loved the waygu beef skewers. We had planned to order more but by the time we finished the course, we were too full to eat much more. We were no doubt very happy with both the food and the service of Mikuni. I will definitely return and will tell all my friends about our nice dining experience at Mikuni

This restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of Fairmont Hotel and is connected directly to the Shopping Mall, Raffles City.Basically, the restaurant is divided into 3 sections, Sushi, Tepanyaki and Robatayaki with respective chefs manning each section. There is also the Main Dining Hall. We opted to sit at the Robatayaki Section. All the items are grilled. We ordered Miyazaki Wagyu Beef, Alaskan Crab, Corn, Asparagus, Scallops and Oysters. The oysters were the tiniest that I have even tasted and we concluded that oysters were best eaten fresh with slice of lemon and Tobasco sauce, rather than grilled. The Wagyu Beef were good. Same goes for the Alaskan Crab leg. We also order Otoro and Uni Sashimi. They were reasonably fresh.When paying for the bill, we received a pleasant surprise where OCBC card holders enjoy 25% off the food items

Was there in January 2018 to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Service staff were friendly & very hospitable. Ambience of restaurant was good & we were very pleased we had made Mikuni a place to meet & catch up.
4
We went on a Sat and all had the set lunch which is well prepared and delicious. The service is good too. We enjoyed our time here greatly and definitely will be back!
4
great food and nice environment the teppanaki was pretty cool ,first time i tried it out.nice place to enjoy ur dinner
4
service was a rather choppy, but overall, the meal was pleasant. the food was good and the seasonal omakase at $120 was well worth it.
5
Tried the teppanyaki set, food is great.
Staff is friendly,
Environment is cosy, worth to pay a visit here.
5
Excellent in all ways. Will be a repeat customer for sure! Prompt and pleasant service. Cosy ambience.
4
Excellent value for money!
Food tastes very good n well presented. Service is courteous yet not intrusive. Excellent for family n business lunch n dinner
5
The servers were attentive and service is great. Food is definitely fantastic, especially the Miyazaki Wagyu!!
4
We have our lunch set at 50% using our AMEX credit card....Good wine good food but the dessert could be better. Teppanyaki is another good ones but a bit too rich for the toppings!Itâ€™s a birthday celebration lunch! It served with ice cream and candle and Japanese dessert too
4
Heard the Jap food was really good here so we tried it out for early NYE dinner. Food was pretty decent, but somehow i felt there wasnt any wow factor overall. Each of the dishes ordered (sashimi, wagyu beef cubes, bbq unagi, mikuni maki roll) was good enough but probably i expected more given the prestige and price tag for the food here. Uni soup was probably the best of the lot.
5
I had the lunch set with sukiyaki beef. The food was excellent. The menu is pricey but the discount offered by Amex made the dining experience more affordable.
4
An excellent to have a proper dinner with good food and impeccable service. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Will be back to try more good food.
1
We ordered a variety of food from the three different stations but all were not amazing. Seemed like the food deteriorated throughout the dishes. It was quite disappointing. For instance, the king crab fried rice did not have the flavour.
3
We love to sit at the teppanyaki counter. Chef Eric is so nice . Love the butter prawns and the beef.
4
I am a frequent lunch and dinner goer to Mikuni but this was the first time I tried the Teppanyaki at the Teppanyaki counter. I had the Mikuni premium set which cost $300. But let me tell you - this is not a set for one. The wait staff was extremely helpful and immediately advised that I should share this with my dinner companion. We were a little doubtful but after the lobster, we were simply stuffed. We started with a decent size plate of fresh salad with raw fish and roe. Extremely refreshing. This was followed by sashimi set with tuna and salmon belly which were simply perfection. Then we had lobster and this was one big lobster smothered with flying fish roe. We were then served with a big slab of foie grais sitting prettily on top of a teppanyakied pineapple. This was followed by super tender wagyu beef. We also had king crab fried rice and miso soup. Dessert was delicate mochi and ice cold honey dew which was really sweet. A big shout out to Chef Eric Yong who served us personally and constantly filled up and replaced our garlic chips. The garlic chips! They were fried to perfection and light and crispy. I think they should bottle these up and sell them.
4
One of the reasons I like to go to Mikuni is because it provides wide selection of Japanese cuisine. I was very much impressed for my recent visit on 12-12-2017 because one the most expensive dish was 200-gram Japanese Wagyu Beef with the price tag of S$175.00++. However, the beef was too oily and hard to be eaten. I passed this feedback to one of the staff and have no intention whatsoever to make a complaint for waiver of this dish. Much to my surprise, when I asked for the bill, this dish was waived. I appreciated this kind gesture very much and would like to visit this restaurant again soon
4
This was my first time trying out the festive winter dinner set of 8 courses at S$250/pax. It was quite similar to an omakase meal except that each dish that came out was well presented and decorated. At the end of the 8 courses, we were still feeling hungry and ordered more sushi. The counter chef also gave complimentary uni with rice mix to fill our appetite.Next time, we will just order the chef's omakase suggestion
3
First time there. We requested for the teppanyaki counter seat but kind of regret because the exhaust hood doesn't seem powerful enough to suck away all smoke.. Tried Teppanyaki at other 5 stars restaurant but never had this issues.Food wise too oily.. the serving of seafood cooked with the "golden sauce" which i think is mayonnaise was really too generous. Chef cooking skill is just normal? nothing special.
3
This was my first time to Mikuni although other members of our party of five had prior experience. Admittedly the decor is pleasant and comfortable but the added Christmas lights are rather glaring and very bright and could not be dimmed. The service staff have been well trained and are attentive. In general the food was nicely presented and the quality reasonably good although the wagyu beef was very fatty and tough. The lobster, however, was very succulent.This is an expensive dining establishment and I'm not fully convinced that one gets good value for your money
3
This is an elegant dining place, with well trained staff. The food is reasonably good, and you will enjoy a comfortable dining environment. The short rib was served with the bone with an impressive marrow content, the tempura was good. The soba was surprisingly overdone n limp. We liked the aburi sushi roll. The eggplant with miso was rather disappointing, but the spinach was delicious. Be prepared to pay for your comfortable dining experience, around $100 per head.
5
Food was as usual awesome and the serving was enough for each person.
Sashimi was very fresh.
I think the restaturant seem understaffed as sometimes it took a while to get the server's attention.
4
The sashimi is fresh but rather pricey. $20 just gets you three slices of salmon. However the other items like maki and those in the teppanyaki range are quite generous in serving sizes and made up gor the sashimi serving sizes.
4
Great food, service, and atmosphere. I come here for business lunches sometimes, perfect place. Prices are a little on the high side.
3
Cannot fault the food - it was all very good quality. But for this price, expect great service and that's where they failed. Had to make an effort to get the attention of the waiting staff and they forgot a couple of ordered items.
5
The services for the restuarant is awesome, the food selection was wide and the food served were awesome.
4
It was a birthday lunch for my dear friend. Attentive staff and lovely ambience. Tables were not very close to each other, so conducive for conversationsale. Presentation of food was interesting. But the lunch set I ordered, the cod was a bit too salty. Otherwise, it's ok. It's pricey though so more for special occasions
5
Want to give a shout out to Valerie and Elaine for their excellent service during lunch today. Their colleague Ron had served me with a cracker with dried prawn seasoning, forgetting that I had mentioned I was allergic to prawn when he took my lunch order. When we highlighted this to Rob and asked for an antihistamine to counter the allergic effects that caused my lips to swell slightly, he brought Valerie the assistant manager who promptly suggested I visited the nearby clinic for consultation and medication at their expense. When I declined due to inconvenience, Valerie volunteered to take a queue number for me to save me from sitting in the waiting room. Nonetheless, I decided against visiting a doctor as the symptoms had not escalated yet. Valerie was very proactive and brought over a cold tower and some ice to reduce the swelling around my lips. It helped and I managed to enjoy the rest of my lunch. Elaine also dropped by to apologize for the mistake. We also appreciated the desserts and ice cream to celebrate my birthday. The food is delicious and well presented. The chef has used top quality ingredients from the rice to the unagi in the unagi don, and the negitoro sushi was creatively made. I would suggest that Mikuni has better processes, and improve server training (not just the chefs) to know what they serve, to avoid serving customers food with allergy triggers.
5
The Premium Teppan Mikuni Course was excellent.  The Lobster with Garlic Soy Sauce, Teriyaki Foie Gras with Caramelized Apple, and Miyazaki Beef were the highlights of this 8-course set menu.  It was very good value for money, given the generous portions and high quality of food.  The attentive service and classy ambience completed the delightful dining experience
5
It was our 1st time visit to this restaurant to celebrate my friend’s birthday last night.Some of us ordered the dinner set and one friend ordered from ala cart menu.Each dishes came with very good setting, delicious and sashimi is very fresh too.After all of us tried the black sesame ice cream, we love it!From the dinner Matsutake set menu, there is a hidden dishe which not stated in the menu. It was a pleasant surprise to us.It is a nice and cosy place for gathering, will definitely come back to try more ala cart menu

On 3rd October I had lunch at one of my favourite Japanese restaurants which I visit every two weeks. On this day i was at the sushi counter and because of my weak legs I asked for a stool to raise up my feet but unfortunately the Restaurant do not have one; however the kind hostess did not turned me down but without any hesitation piled up some thick books & magazines to raise up my feet. It was indeed a very kind gesture on her part and of course I was able to enjoy my lunch; which otherwise would have dampened my spirit causing me to leave with very strained feet; but that was not to be. Though solo I never felt lonely or out of place because the chef kept me company throughout my lunch, familarising me with all the Japanese ingredients of the day. I truly enjoyed my lunch and added to it the finer part of Japanese cuisine. I left with greater knowledge of a fine Japanese cuisine
5
Really five star service in my opinion. All the staff are very professional and polite. As this is my first visit, I asked for recommendations and they gave great options. Love the truffle kampachi so much.
Will definitely be back for more!
5
Mikuni never fails with the good range of food. I was happy to be able to try the matsutake dinner set which was something I've always wanted to try. Very enjoyable experience!
3
The restaurant is very popular so it is crowded most of the time. They were short
Handed thus service was not up to standard.
Food can be better.
4
As always, good business lunch spot but it has become more pricey. Beware the extras (prawn crackers, mochi) which they bring you, without first asking, which will cost you and adds up to quite a bit.
5
It wasn't easy getting a reservation at Mikuni, and when we finally did, we thought that the dining experience was well worth the bother of an advance reservation. Such a wonderful place for a family to bond over a cosy and satisfying meal. The service was excellent, and the bentos were served in exquisite and pretty crockery and utensils. Needless to say, we were totally happy with the taste and quality of the dishes. Our verdict: the meal was truly worthy of praise!

Mikuni has been my favourite Japanese restaurant for special occasion, I love their service, the food quality and how the Chef presented the food. It is worth the money and time to dine here.After read news about the new Chef for Mikuni, was excited to visit again. But was totally disappointed due to the following reason.1) service crew are no longer friendly and passionate in serving customer, I felt like talking to a machine with no face expression. When I was browsing the menu and not sure what to order, the staff just stood there without recommending any dishes or informed ya what is the seasonal food.After that, informed the service crew to serve the maki, but end up with a reply “You never order this maki”. Felt so shocked to receive such a reply from a five star hotel’s restaurant, even though I did not order. It could be a more friendly reminder. 2) we ordered prawn with golden sauce, slow cook beef ribs and Unagi.For the prawn, the quality has drop so much as I believe they are serving frozen prawn, the texture are no longer firm and fresh.The ribs are good, but it was cold when served, partly due to the staff that are not sure which table order this and walk for a while before found us. The presentation are very Low standard. And the Unagi dish is the most disappointing dish we have, previously it is presented nicely in a unique plate, now it is simply placed in small plate and the portion has been reduced.I understand that new Chef will have different style, but it should be better than the previous chef, not to be getting worst and using cheaper quality food and presentation, but maintaining the price. During the whole night, our tea was not refill automatically, there are no staff to ask us how’s the food or checking if we need to refill tea, which was a plus point previously as it is part of the dining experience.I seriously hope the management can look into this issue and improve every aspect forward. It is disappointing to see such a drastic drop in service level and food quality in such a short time.
4
Food is better than average. Service is better than average but can be even better seeing this restaurant is in a 5 stars hotel. Price is on high end side and for the price, i hope restaurant will consider upping sashimi variety given for lunch bento sets than the usual sashimi in a regular restaurant. Feed back on lighting for seats in center row - spot lights are too glaring one side of seats.
3
Nice ambience. Fresh sashimi. However, personally I feel that it is overpriced. Nothing left a deep impression in me except the chef served me a burnt asparagus. Didn't expect a high class restaurant that charged a premium would served me burnt asparagus. Told the server and they replace another set for me. Really surprised that chef have the guts to serve it out to us.
5
The best meal in Singapore!I had the pleasure to experience the new set menu at Mikuni restaurant created by Chef Keisuke and it was out of this planet. Amazing combination of taste and beautiful presentation of each dish and impeccable service. If anyone looking for a top modern Japanese cuisine in Singapore this is the best place to go
5
We had our lunch together with my family last week and we were stunt with all the teppanyaki food that was serve to us. We would like to recognize the great Chef Eric who prepared the food for us and is very attentive. The server Aira did a very good job as well who is very attentive with all our special request and is very engaging. Thank you Mikuni! We will surely come back!
5
Service here is awesome! We were served by Miss Z.. (sorry can't rmb the name) and she is very friendly and sweet. Food is good too! Fresh seafood and authentic Japanese food.
3
It has both Teppanyaki and Robatayaki counters, which is rare in Singapore. Try to visit during lunch where the lunch sets are cheaper.
4
Mikuni serves quality food and prices are on the high side. The restaurant is dimly lighted but many tables have spot lights shining directly on you which was very uncomfortable. I had to try a few tables to get one that was not so glaring.
4
Very good food though it's also very pricey. The restaurant is a bit dark for business lunch though. Service was okay.
3
This is our 2nd time in this restaurant which we decided to give it a 2nd chance. Took the dinner set and prawn was too creamy and can't taste the prawn flavor. Sit at the Teppanyaki table but no show given by the chef as he is just merely like a chef doing his cooking in the kitchen. We always love the fried garlic and always asked for more during our dishes but was saddened when we over heard the chef saying to the waitress that the garlic was flown from Japan and if we want some more we had to pay for it. Faithfully the waitress came and told us about it. We paid almost S$400 for a family of 4 and we are celebrating our son's birthday and does this small issue on garlic counts for the amount we are paying. The chef needs to be trained and more careful & courteous on his works in a 5 star restaurant and with such a good atmosphere. Hmmh ..... the hotel needs to rethink whether they have the right Chef manning the Teppanyaki cooking table.
5
Went there with my husband for our anniversary and the service is really great right from stepping in till end of our meal.We reserved a table at the teppanyaki table as we both love the robatayaki and teppanyaki. They had forgotten about my husband's order and we were wondering why the other people who came later were being served first. After we checked, they apologised about it even when we finished our meal and was leaving near the door.Frankly the excellent service just covered up the flaw.In addition as they knew we were celebrating our anniversary, they had also prepared a cake for us.Overall we enjoyed the meal and would like to compliment Ron for his great service as well as the assistant chef (did not get his name but a very hardworking Malay) who kept coming over to check if our food was okay.My only surprise was how come the chef was not the one cooking behind the teppanyaki table but only giving instruction
1
Service was super slow. I felt I was playing the waiting game. Waited 10 minutes for the menu, waited long for the food. There were 2 of us, but the food didn't come at the same time, by the time my friend's food came, I had already finished mine. Dessert took super long to arrive, this despite us telling the waitress that we had to rush back to office as our lunch time was over. Explanation given was that my dessert was premium therefore it requires much time to make. I really wanted to laugh out loud when I saw my dessert which consists of 2 small tiny fruits, 1 macaron and a small scoop of ice cream, it doesn't seem they need to take 20 minutes to make that. Please do not lie to customers if you are busy, don't give excuse and make it seems like the dessert is freshly made that's why it takes long. Finally, I called to inform them that I would be celebrating a birthday, they forgot to give the complimentary ice cream which I had requested for when making my reservations, I had to remind them and that ice cream took another 15 minutes to come! All in all, spent around 2 hours there for a simple lunch! What makes it terrible is that this is a fine dining restaurant
3
Went there for Tepanyaki dinner with my guest from oversea last week. Choose a set course dinner at $175++ per pax which include raw oyster, prawn, beef etc. Quality of the food is good eg oyster, beef etc BUT the way it is cooked is not authentic Japanese taste as expected. More like a fusion with Western cooking. Example the prawn was cooked with a lot of creamy cheese sauce. Just could not taste the prawn itself. Just disappointed with the cooking. Will not go there again
5
Great central location at the Fairmont Hotel. Food is awesome as always. Tasty, fresh and cooked just right to render the natural Flavours.Robatayaki section is a prized gem located at the far end of the restaurant, where food is served fresh from the grill.A highly recommended restaurant for those keen to get a taste of high quality Japanese cuisine whilst in Singapore
1
I have been patronizing Mikuni since the time it was called Inagiku. On average I visit it once a month, with my wife, friends or business contacts. In fact, I use it for entertainment quite often.On 26 August my wife and I had lunch there. I was astounded to be charged SGD3 each for water. This had never been done before. It wasn't so at my previous visit on 17 June. When queried, the staff said that this was a new policy introduced by management.The water in Singapore is drinkable straight from the tap. Bottled water is an environmental sin, consuming resources unnecessarily. Mikuni charges a 10% service charge, as is usual in Singapore. On an SGD80 meal this comes to SGD8. For this, they can't even provide water?! I can only conclude that this new policy is meant to squeeze more money out of customers.Restaurants in Japan, Taiwan, the UK, the USA, Australia (to name a few countries) do not charge extra for water. Nor do they impose a service charge.Price gouging of this nature can only be stopped if customers demonstrate that they will not put up with it. I will not return to Mikuni. The result of this misguided and exploitative policy is that they will lose the business that I bring to them, which far exceeds the money they get from the water charge. If management thinks this is good business they should think again
4
Food is great.
Chef Eric is very friendly and approachable and has never disappoint.
Nice atmosphere
4
Food was great, service could have been faster but acceptable! The set deal was very value for money, would definitely get it next time.
5
Delicious vegetarian Sushi. The chef prepared a mouth watering silken tofu dish for us. Beautiful ambience , courteous staff and exquisite dining.
4
The prawns with golden sauce tasted very good and were packed with rich flavours. Good dishes and recommended:)
5
Always loved Mikuni! And always have surprises! Had a really wonderful time.. great food, great people and ambience.
4
Ate here today for my retirement lunch, really like the care and attention to detail that has gone into the presentation of the food. Food is really fresh and the standard starkly contrasts to those "normal Japanese" restaurants elsewhere (you get to see what proper Japanese food is). Price is on the high side but it's worth it as you're also paying for an experience. 10/10 will be here again
5
If you love high quality Japanese food, you cannot miss Mikuni.We had an amazing dinner thanks to the new Executive Chef Mr. Keisuke Uno, an incredibly talented Chef who - we're sure - wil soon gain many accolades in Singapore Food Scenario. We opted for the Chef's Tasting Menu and it was really outstanding. Just to mention some highlights: the cold steam fois gras custard with Hokkaido sea food was memorable, the Grilled Miso Marinated Black Cod was one of the best things my husband and myself have ever tasted in our life, it was just heaven; the slow cooked wagyu beef was exceptional. Thanks to Chef Uno, Fairmont Singapore Hotel (which by the way looked overall a little bit warn out and in need for a general refurbishment) will surely have a great boost.Our congratulation to Chef Uno and deepest thank you for the exceptional culinary experience he created for us. Looking forward to coming back
4
It was a nice and cozy place for a good date night for us. The service was excellent and attentive as well as the food. The service staff also make effort to assist us on the 10% discount voucher to ensure that we can utilize them to pay for the bill as we had sake
5
Thought we would bring the kids to try a fine dining experience at Mikuni and we were not disappointed. Service was prompt and staff made sure we sat in a quiet area in the rather Äºarge restaurant. We ordered many dishes and each were well presented and elegant. The fried calamari was excellent along with the fresh sashimi and sushi rolls. We opted to sample from the rather large menu vs the set which added variety for the entire family to enjoy. I would recommend Mikuni but it is on the pricey side which shocked my girls when they first opened up the menu. However, we all left rather pleased and recommend for special occasions.
3
Staying at Fairmont hotel, took the chance to get 30% discount on foods at the inside-hotel restaurant.Well greeted by the server, given a seat.Asked for her recommendation as I had not idea what to expect, then she was rather confused what to suggest.I ended up ordering the tasting menu, costed me almost 200 sgd for several small dishes.Presentations were okay, but Nothing tastes really special deserving the price.I enjoyed the good red wine though.By the end, one of the "managers" (I presume), came approaching me. Then simply asked me to try their Teppanyaki. Probably that was the meal I should have had. But no second time. Would rather try and find other restaurants during the same visit.Probably during my next visit/stay at Fairmont hotel
5
very good quality jap food although the price is a big high. went there with sister for a birthday lunch and my sister loves the food!
5
The food was excellent as was the service . we had to catch a flight so we were a bit short of time - they had us in and out without rushing .
4
Friendly service but could be warmer. Service is the distinguishing factor when food and ambience are reliably good.
4
Food is great, fresh. i like the cod fish, grilled in perfect condition. The unagi is a bit salty than other places, but fresh is very tender and juicy. Dessert pudding is great as well.
4
I have been to Mikuni several times and their standard has been consistently good. I had their unagi don and beef don recently and the quality is fantastic.
5
The settling and ambient is ideal for business lunch. Food is good. Interesting set menu. Good service staff.
5
Came here to celebrate my son's 18th birthday and he's a Japanese food lover.The service from the waitress was excellent and always very attentive and meeting our needs. We love the fresh sashimi food, lobster and sushi. The teppanyaki option was really excellent and fresh. Highly recommended for those who have a high standard for good Japanese food
5
Is my first experiance with Japanese restaurant in SG and left very happy what received Staff seems received good training with good knowledge about menu inc drinks .Also offered special for a day etc , nice really liked that but on same time not very pushy and not intusing Very good variation of food and prices Amazing service from Elaine and rest of Team . Generally very smooth service After last order music was switched off what a bit kiss a 5 star experiance however still very happy and like to recommended and back again

For a pricey highly rated restaurant, Mikuni was a let down.Lured by good reviews, we rang for a table for 2.We were told they were full but decided to 'walk in'. It was half empty, we were seated immediately.The Robotayaki platter was supposed to be the star of the dinner (>$100). The grilled meats were dry, greasy and tasteless that we had to ask for some sauce. They only had chilli sauce, - no thank you. We couldn't finish it and asked the waitress to take it away. She mistook it for 'takeaway'. However, they 'accidentally threw it away and prepared a new serving for us to 'takeaway'.The unagi don came highly recommended.It wasn't bad certainly didn't live up to the hype. I had better quality rice at home cooked in a default rice cooker setting. I think that says a lot.The fried squid was just okay. Nothing's wrong but also nothing's right about it.We also ordered a maki - it had so many ingredients in it we couldn't taste anything in the end. It was so thick, fatter than a thick Korean gimbap. Overall, it wasn't a delicious dinner, and my wallet took quite a blow too
3
We were seated at the Robatayaki as it was last minute booking on that day. Was told restaurant was quite full but not like it when we arrived at the restaurant. Food is ok as I would not say it is fantastic. We had eaten few good Japanese restaurants often with the teens children so it kind of different experience for them. My sister and I had visited probably over 10 years ago. It still do not wow us.Ambience was good and it was kind of dark, making it looked like fine dining restaurant. Service staff was not so attentive (not busy in our section only 2 diners group including us) as we have to request few times for topping up out tea. Staff also not sure on the credit card promotions. Nothing being mentioned as certain CC having certain promotions for using the card. We saw the Amex card promotion from other reviewer and ask the staff about it but she seem not aware. I think it is slight over priced for the food served. With the price paid, we would have better quality food from another good small authentic restaurant with good personal service.If you asked me, would I come again. Er .. probably will but would be quite a while (hopefully not another 10 years
5
Any fresher, you will probably have to visit Japan to have it. That is how good their Sashimi and Chirashidon is.
2
We ordered prawn with golden sauce, chanko nabe, truffle kampachi and spicy maguro maki. Prawns were likely glass prawn that tasteless and golden sauce was poorly done. Spicy maguro- what I taste was only spices taste; chanko nabe was ok miso broth seafood
4
We went there using the AMEX promotion - 50% off for 2 people. If not for the promotion, it would have been so pricey! Nonetheless, great quality japanese food :)
4
Good food as usual. The set is of good standard. Tasty and nice. If you are eating tepanyaki good to ask for seats at the counter.
5
Ron exceeds in his work standards. Abigail is pleasant, friendly and courteous when we arrived at the reception. Kudos to the Chef & team for the delicious tepanyaki lunch.
5
I have been Mikuni quite often due to the special lunch discount for Amex card.
The chef is friendly and he remembered what I usually ordered, so it's easy.
4
The food was delicious but they have different kitchens for different types of food. One of us got her food very early and was done before the rest of our food even came. They did give us some ice cream later as compensation which was very thoughtful
4
It's worthy if you have 50% off, doesn't matter where you get it. Ambiance was good, it is in Fairmont. Service was professional. The food was alright. Above average compared to the market standard. However our main courses were a bit cold when served. AND, the pace of serving was not really considerate. Three main courses rushed in almost at the same time. We had to rush eating before it got even colder. You can visit with 50% off, for some ok Japanese food with decent setting.

So we came here and it was full because there was an American Express promotion and everyone got 50% off. Everyone staying at Fairmont got 30% off. We were the only people who had to pay full price and the a la carte menu was very expensive - of course it is if most people only have to pay 50%!! And on top of that they charge for water and hot tea which most restaurants give for free. We ordered the sushi rolls which were dry and didn't have much ingredients - most of the sushi rolls in town are packed full of different ingredients whereas these were singular in taste. The grilled lamb was a joke at 4 small cubes. Only the grilled uni was good. Overall not worth in both price and taste.

Mikuni is set in a modern deco with cozy ambience that make wonderful dining experience for couples as well as for private business discussion. Service staff are very friendly and attended customers well. Food quality is not exceptionally but reasonably good. Special dining promotion is available to AMEX Platinum card holder. Really worth to come here for fine dining at such nice setting
5
Last week I dine at Mikuni and I enjoyed the sushi and sashimi. The service was very good despite of the busy night and special mention to Aira who took care of us. We will surely come back
3
Food was good but rather pricey for a set lunch. Wait staff were overworked and looked rather harassed; hard to get their attention for tea refills or even for getting the bill.
4
As has come to be expected, good food with consistency. Food slow in arriving though. Service was on the whole good but with some exceptions, eg the server who returned with the receipt and credit card and plonked it on the table.
4
Uminosachi teppanyaki at Mikuni: Juicy prawns paired with succulent cod fillet.. All ended well with espresso ice cream for dessert 😋
4
The restaurant is up to the expectations. Very good sushi and fresh tempura. The golden sause shrimps were exceptional. The wine start from 80$sgd. atmosphere sophisticated and services is impeccable.
3
We ordered omakase value at $230 each but did not feel value for money. We were given only 7 courses & before we knew it, it was done.

Mikuni occupies the old premises of Inagiku. We used to go to Inagiku so often for their teppanyaki. And we stopped because they decided to renovated their place and made it extremely dark and gloomy. So Mikuni took over the restaurant, kept the same deco, added more lights, added more tables, converted the teppanyaki table, changed the menu and made the whole place more vibrate. When I was there last night, it was full house. We wanted to try the degustation kaiseki menu but decided not to because one of the items is beef. And we don't take beef. A waitress gave us her honest opinion that changing the meat item will not justify the cost. We decided to try their a la carte items instead. The teppanyaki dishes were great. The skewers were ok. But the sashimi platter was awesome. They do not have a large selection of sake but I was hoping to see pictures of bottles of sake instead of just words. Maybe that's me because I try to remember the sake I drank over the years by their labels. Overall, we had a good time. However I think the tables are really too closed together. There is not much privacy because you can hear someone's conversation 3 tables away
5
I have been to many fine dining Japanese Restaurants in Singapore, but experience of Mikuni is something different. Elegant ambient, attentive and caring staff and most importantly food quality and taste is wonderful. Prices are high, but considering Amex Platinum 50% off the bill for 2 pax, it's definitely a good deal. For sure will come back
4
Another memorable fine dining experience at Mikuni with quality food, excellent service and sophisticated ambience. But alas, with its prices, it's also a place where I can only go to once a year, on special occasions. Would have given 5 stars if not for the prices.
5
My dinner experience with my business associate started with the Spring Dinner Set & Mikuni Grand Tasting Tour Spring Menu. Both of us shared the two set which was exquisite almost 13 dishes (6 + 7) which was a little too much. But the pricing was exquisite with 50% is payment by American Express Platinum Card. These delicious dishes coupled with the Junmai Daiginjo sake were "heavenly". We left feeling very satisfied and would return soon to savour the other choices
1
Undoubtedly the worst dinning experience in a very long time, vowed never again to set foot in this lousy establishment.
5
Very good food and excellent service. Good value especially with Amex Platinum card discount. Lunches are normally fully booked.
5
Restaurant was classy and the beef is not bad. As now have promotion for credit card so it is worth.
5
One of my most enjoyable dining in Singapore. The service was first class and they made us feel important. The food was superb, equivalent to one of the best restaurants in Japan. This is the place to be for any celebration. Well done!
5
One of the best place for fresh Japanese food. Love the setting and ambience. The seafood bowl with rice (forgot the name) is a must try serves with different kinds of fresh seafood. Next is the Truffle sea urchin tofu is another must try and so much more. The price is even more worth it if you using an Amex card.
4
The overall food quality is good and the sashimi is fresh. If you are having a business lunch, avoid the tapanyaki room which tends to be noisy and smokey. You will also get better service attention in the main dining hall. Do note that there is a dress code so no round neck T-shirts, shorts or slippers

Mikuni has many strengths and serves up different aspects of Japanese cuisine, such as teppanyaki, robatayaki, sushi and sashimi. The sake list is also well thought-out. Having frequented Mikuni at different times over the last 3 years during dinner but having been absent for a year, I decided to take a friend there for lunch. It is still classy, intimate and beautiful, and the restaurant was naturally almost full when we walked in for our reservation.We were seated at a very nice table for 2 deep inside the restaurant, but I wanted robatayaki and asked to be seated in the room for robatayaki, which contains an array of fresh produce from Japan on display and seats 9 people comfortably. I ordered the $68++ robatayaki lunch set and one truffle sea urchin (uni) tofu from the a la carte menu (because that dish is also available in the current spring dinner set menu, and I was trying to decide whether to order that set when I next return for dinner), while my friend ordered the Uminosachi teppan set and requested for no seafood to be present in her dishes except for the chawanmushi. The server checked with the kitchen, which obliged with cod and salmon for her. This was a tremendous plus point for her. We requested hot tea. The waitress in charge of looking after guests in the robatayaki section forgot to get the sake list which I had enquired after. That was eventually handed to me after she apologised, and I chose a carafe of Shouzanten junmai daiginjo. The truffle sea urchin tofu arrived in 3 dainty bowls and was beautifully presented, but it did not have enough umami in the combined taste of ingredients, despite using fresh uni. Mikuni's salad with homemade dressing arrived, and it was a scrumptious palate cleanser. The crackers were sadly not memorable. However, the ingredients used are always premium, even on a Monday, and I enjoyed the chawan mushi, followed by the first platter containing Hokkaido scallop grilled in onion butter, Atka mackerel from Kyushu, and green asparagus. No sauce was required for the asparagus. The mackerel had several big bones and small bones, so caution in chewing is advised when eating it, but it was tender and so intensely delightful. The skin could have been slightly less-done ie not black. The scallop was eaten last, and the sauce combined with the juices of the scallop was very tempting for me to use my tongue to lick up every drop, but I resisted.Next was the platter containing a skewer of Kagoshima wagyu beef with garlic soya, a skewer of Kurobuta pork tsukune with egg yolk, and Hokkaido sweet corn. As usual, I ate from right to left. Every mouthful was a joy, and happily washed down with the sake. Kyoto-style herring fish soba was last before dessert, while my friend enjoyed her garlic fried rice and miso soup. The mixed fruit panna cotta was a suitably decadent finish without being overly rich. We were full, but not unpleasantly bloated or sleepy, and content. In my opinion, for a lunch bento of premium quality and variety, or for set lunches of teppanyaki and robatayaki and if you are willing to spend between $70 to $100 for lunch, Mikuni is the place to enjoy. I was also pleasantly surprised with a 25% discount, when using my OCBC credit card to pay for the bill. My friend adored Mikuni's food and decor and overall ability to impress, and I have convinced her to return whenever she is in Singapore and craves Japanese food, which is a favourite cuisine of hers. I will definitely return to Mikuni for dinner soon enough, although I cannot decide between the Grand Spring tasting menu (not the spring dinner set menu) or Robatayaki. I am glad that Mikuni exists and thrives in Singapore, and I look forward to my next visit

I always had reservations about Japanese restaurants in hotels, but decided on Mikuni given the attractive Amex card deal for 2 pax. We ordered the "Grand "Tasting Tour Spring Menu". I rate it as Average, in comparing this with other stand-alone Jap restaurants similar dinner sets. I am sure the lunch sets are well worth the value when using the card. The reason for the Average rating is that whilst the quality of food was okay, there was really nothing in terms of special Japanese seasonal stuff one gets in the authentic restaurants. The presentation was somewhat overboard in my opinion. Lastly, the restaurant was full on a Saturday night and rather noisy. Not quite the experience I was hoping for
4
Staff were all very attentive. We ordered:- hotate with ebiko. They were good but too much of orange zest (if that's what is on top of it)- tuna roll. This is my favourite dish of the evening. - prawns in golden sauce - the sauce is really rich. - yasai moriawase
5
Went for lunch based on a lot calls recommendation and were not disappointed. Prices are high but that is Singapore at least the Business Bento Box is relatively reasonably priced, at least with the hotel discount. Just let them know you are staying at the Fairmont Hotel and you get a 30% off food.
3
This restaurant serves fresh seafood from Japan.
Ambience is nice but I find it a little too dark.
Service is ok.
Prices are a little high considering the grade of fish they serves.
4
Quality food which kept us returning for more. The lunch set is quite worth a try, will want to return to try their sushi bar one day.
4
The dishes were both visually pleasing and delightful in taste. The sous chef entertained and was happy to educate us on the dishes which I love. Great wall designs and artwork.
4
Love the food especially the Truffle Kampachi. Must try!
Service in this restaurant is superb. A tad overpriced but I would visit again.
The restaurant gifted a scoop of green tea ice cream for birthday celebration. 👍🏻
5
Sit with about sixteen others around the grill and the chef will prepare a delicious meal in front of you. Large prawns, wagyu beef, aubergines, and grilled vegetables washed down by a beautiful wine is the way to go. Delicious!

Is time of the year (1st-10TH MARCH) which japan celebrate doll's festival.Mikuni had a hina matsuri bento for $100 with credit card promotion less 20% cheaper than last year. ($120).Don't think bento set is like normal bento serve in any japanese restaurant.This bento consists of six portion and each section has a different type of food.(view photo)Really impress, taste good and very pretty, there is also dessert and drink included in the set. Wonderful lunch. When the bill came there was a charge of $20. when I enquire the waiter explain is for the green tea serve. But my friend was not happy why they have to charge for tea, other japanese restaurant do not charge.The manager came make some explanation about company policy but as a good guesture they were not charge us tis time.That make the lunch even more scrumptious
5
Fell in love with the setting of the place and the atmosphere. Ordered the grilled lobster with uni sauce and the yellowtail topped with yuzu which were both brilliantly done. Definitely recommend going for the cocktails here, which were light and refreshing (especially the sochu based one) and which truly had a Japanese twist to it. Amiel was great, giving us brilliant recommendations and spent time introducing us to his latest cocktail creations which we truly enjoyed. Will definitely return
4
Everything looks great in Mikuni. The table setting, the spaceousness of tables, the atmosphere, the little mobile light for you to read the menu in darkness, the view from the window, etc are all very nice. But when the food came, you will notice that it is a bit less than what you would expect from a five star rated Japanese restaurant. The appetiser of tofu sheet is delicious except the ikura which is far from fresh. Rest of the dish are similar, great in presentation but you will find the details not really followed through. It is still a great meal but not five star. Sorry.
5
I thought the food was very good. Fresh, nice range of choices and very tasty. Loved the cod, and the best Unagi sashimi I have every tasted. The service was attentive, though they did initially forget our wine order. We had a great meal. The pricing was on the high end, but not surprising for a hotel restaurant
5
Tonight I dined in Mikuni the Japanese restaurant within the Fairmont Hotel complex. I chose the Spring Teppanyaki set menu. Sous chef Eric is a real master. Beautiful food cooked with love and passion and a slight edge but authentically Japanese. The size of the courses and the speed with which they were delivered meant it was a culinary delight.
5
Food are fresh and delicious but it does not come cheap. The service is excellent and they are extremely polite
5
wonderful food, had the special set for valentine's day. had a great time with Chef Eric. wonderful man and excellent chef. will go back again
5
Celebrated my mom's birthday there. The omakasae was beautifully balanced in taste and portions. Would definitely recommend it!
5
Best Jap restaurant in Singapore.
Excellent value for teppan n roba set lunches. Coffee was too ex. For $7 black coffee, it should be free flow like ocha.
5
My husband and I tried the tepanyaki and enjoyed it very much. The staffs there were friendly and courteous. We will definitely go back again with family.
2
Service is average as restaurant seems to be short handed in staff. Our sashimi order was almost forgotten. Another dish was totally forgotten and though the waiter realised the mistake, we decided to cancel the order. Dish for other table was served to us by mistake. The restaurant compensated us with specialdessert though we did not make a fuss
1
It doesn't matter the reviews about the food. It doesn't matter about the loyalty program. When you are smacked in the face with horrific service it tars the entire dining experience. I have been coming to Mikuni less and less because each and everytime I come the service seriously worsens. I came for dinner because of an invitation with grave reluctance and trepidation. I tried not to overthink it. But yes well. The experience from waiting at an empty reception to talking to several ladies who act bewildered and tried to brush you off - well it does not augment well for a dinner experience. I waited with my dinner companion at the dark reception for 15 minutes with no answers. This is not the first time this has happened and it's been pretty inevitable every time I come. Mikuni should really do something about the horrific service and seating plans.
5
Been here on many occasions but I'm never disappointed. Tokujou sashimi and lobster uniyaki are well known but if you're with friends, order the moriwase and ala carte instead of sets and there will be plenty to go around. Cold Kake Cha Soba is my favourite though simple to many. The noodles do not have that floury taste as compared to elsewhere and when dipped in the sauce, it's light but still managed to coat every strand. Quality is always ensured and service will try to stay attentive. Cosy ambience in the dining hall is good for dates too. If you would like to share a dish, inform the service and the kitchen would separate the dish for you.
3
For a restaurant at this level, I would expect much better service. Firstly, it took a while to give us the menu and return to take order despite the section that we were seated at was not full. We ordered a few items to share (2 diners). A starter, 2 robatayaki items, tempura, grilled Boston lobster (mains), and a garlic fried rice. Strangely, the lobster was served as a first dish, and the starter came towards the end. And, they missed one of the robatayaki item. We didn't order again as we felt it was enough food already. When we asked why the main came first, the staff simply said they could hold it for us. By the time it was reserved, it was cold; they did not even keep it warm
5
Went there for lunch with colleagues and experience was TOP class. After a long time had such perfect well balanced Japanese food in SG. I ordered Grilled Fish set that comes with Miso soup, appetisers, dessert, rice and pickles etc. Fish was very fresh and well seasoned.Japanese tea offered was also well balanced suiting the meal.Ambience is great.
5
Mikuni is located at Fairmont Hotel Singapore. It serves Japanese food and the ambience is awesome!
The food is great and the experience is amazing. Been there four times; first for ala carte, the second robatayaki, the third teppanyaki and finally ala carte again.
4
Choices were plentiful. The atmosphere was pleasant. We ended up going with the sets for simplicity. No one rushed us which was nice.
1
They have an Amex Platinum Card promotion, but when I presented my Amex Platinum(issued from the US) then they told me that they only honour card issued in Singapore
4
Both the food and service were excellant. We ordered Tepinyaki. The 30% discount for guest of the Stamford was an added bonus.
4
Enjoyed the ambience very much. However, the table next to us was too close for comfort and we could here their conversation too loud and clear.
4
The food is quite good but the ambience is a tad too noisy. Definitely not a good place for business lunch. It gets crowded during lunch time.
3
The hot dishes (eggplant starter, pork skewers) were good but the sushi wasn't. For the price we were expecting much better food. Service was also a bit rough--inattentive and sloppy at times. Disappointing.
1
Made the appointment at last minute. Ordered two sashimi lunch set. Quite disappointed with the low quality of Sashimi served. Thin sliced sashimi were not fresh but charged at a premium price. When we gave feedback to them about the food, they exchanged with some lower price but still poor quality of sashimi. Service was average. The ambience was not impressive. Shocked to see a small hair (an eye lash or nose hair?) in my bowl of rice during the meal. Definitely not recommend
4
My family and I have been going back to Mikuni regularly for the past couple of years. Despite being slightly on the pricey side, we find the quality of food is good and the service staff is very attentive and good. In particular, one of the staff by the name of Aimel, who have been consistently providing excellent service to us whenever we go there. He remembers all our usual requests and needs and brings them to us without having to request for it. The only area where the restaurant might want to improve on is their attention on dress code. We were always reminded at reservation that we should come in smart casual, no slippers and shorts. However, there have been more than one incident,the latest being last Saturday 21 January 2017, where the restaurant allows patron to come in for dinner despite not adhering to the dress code by coming in shorts and flip flops. I suggest its either the restaurant ensure that all patrons are properly dressed or they allow free dressing for all. In that case, they shouldn't consider themselves as fine dining and should adjust their pricing appropriately
4
I visit once every few months, and with a loyalty card, don't pay through my nose for meals there. The sets are certainly worth trying.. If you are a sashimi and sushi lover, then get a seat at the sushi counter and try the omakase. Not the very best I've had, but a (visual and gastronomic) treat nonetheless
5
Very good choice of lunch set and still able to enjoy the 50% off for with the Amex Platinum card. Very good value.
4
Would recommend anyone who wants Japanese food but undecided what to eat as mikuni offers Teppanyaki, Sushi and Robatayaki.
5
This is not the first time we visit this restaurant. As with previous experience, service was good and food yummy!
4
Took the grilled prawn and roast pork belly set lunch. Was incredibly tasty n well presented. Value for money but be sure to book prior or may be seated last at odd corners!
4
Nice setting and cozy table. We ordered sashimi and rabatayaki of chicken n wagyu beef which was delish! The highlight was the mochi ice cream. Definitely going again
4
Food at Mikuni does not disappoint. Sashima fresh and top quality. Grilled foods all done to perfectness. Wait staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Very enjoyable experience.
5
Had a very good time at mikuni . But towards the end the service was slow maybe due to high crowd volume . But they still try their best to get things done . Only disappointment is they ran out of salmon belly at the very start of the service.
4
We heard Mikuni served good Japanese food and decided to give it a try. We had teppanyaki dinner at the counter. Their menu was quite pricey but using AMEX promotion will save you 50% for 2 persons dinning. On the yummy menu, we could not decide what to order initially. Through Chef Eddie's recommendation, we ordered the beef, prawns, grilled veg along with starters and sashimi. The beef was perfectly done and was tender & juicy! Prawns were very fresh too!
4
tasteful ambiance, refined dishes, interesting tasting menus, efficient service. party of 3 shared full tasting menu and some ala-carte items. excellent way to sample several different dishes and preparations. all dishes well presented and prepared, flavors and ingredients clean and balanced. overall excellent dining experience. to split hairs, a few of the tasting plates were transcendent, others were very good but just not remarkable. for the per-person cost of a full dinner, every dish should be amazing, not just very good. refined and relaxing atmosphere. parking can be problematic and reservations recommended, give yourself extra time to arrive
4
Went on a Monday for lunch. It was quite crowded as usual. Hence reservation is recommended. Price is slightly on the pricy side. However, the portion for the set lunch & its quality does make up for it, somewhat. Service is quite good. So is the food presentation.
5
Good quality Japanese food with pleasant service.
50% off if you charge to your American express card for 2 pax.
Good variety of dishes. Kid friendly too.
3
I have Teppanyaki dinner. The quality of the food is average and portion of the beef is too little as the dinner is more than $150++ per person. However, the dessert mochi ice cream was excellent
4
Good value if you can take advantage of the American Express 1-for-1 offer. Otherwise, the sets are somewhat pricey, and the a la carte selection, even more so. However, quality and service were very good.
4
Tried the Teppanyaki lunch sets. Food is fresh and not too salty. Portion is just enough for lunch. Service is ok considering almost full house capacity.
5
Love Mikuni for the cozy ambiance, service and most importantly food quality. My favorites are Kawaii mono and truffle kampachi.
5
The food was great. It is fresh, really showngood quality of beef and lobster.
Nice places for dinner
3
Went for the business set lunches, the taste and flavor could be improved for my sashimi and lobster set but my sister enjoyed the beef set. The 3 different waitresses provided good service and even mentioned the discount given for a certain bank credit card.
5
I had a business lunch with some and we ordered different items of the lunch set which were all amazingly tasty and lovely plated. The service is also impecaable though the staff could smile a little more!
4
Staffs are attentive n friendly. Food is good. Embience definitely excellent. We ordered unagi don which is excellent. The tempura kurobuta pork is abit over cooked and the california maki is perfect with the roe. Lastly, chocolate was generously offered upon payment made. Tho is little complimentary gesture but this leaves a sweet n nice ending
2
I have not once feel satisfied or happy with my meal there. The Sashimi was fine but the grilled fish, Tempura, Teppanyaki and others were always disappointing.The ambience is good and the 50% discount that we were entitled made us go back a couple of times ... I Hv asked my friend to remind me to forget about the discount n not to go back! If ambience n price are ur deciding factors (n not very fussy about Jap food) then yes , good place to go if u have the 50% discount.
5
This was my first experience for Kaiseki Japanese cuisine. We all went for the Bento Box special and were not disappointed. Sashimi was incredibly fresh and the lobster was amazing. The numerous dishes and flavours made for a memorable evening.
4
Good quality food with good service. Food is served fast and hot. Just that I would prefer a brighter dining environment as the place is a little too dim.
5
Excellent service staff, reasonable waiting time. Nice ambience. Amazing fresh seafood and delicious cooks food.
5
Went Mikuni with my wife to celebrate our Anniversary. The food were served promptly and staff were attentive. Love their tepanyaki beef sirloin, lobster and salmon skin maki!
It is slighly pricey but worth it for the ambience and yummy food!
5
All thanks to the Amex dining privileges.
Loved the rotabayaki lunch set menu. Wagyu was fantastic. Will go back to try other selections on the menu.
3
I've been to Mikuni a few times, and have always received great quality food and excellent service! But this was a clear exception. We got the vibe that the staff did not pay us much heed/looked down on us because we were young students. Also, our waiter took our order wrongly which resulted in our meals arriving at different times. I don't blame the waiter, people are only human! But the Unagidon was obviously rushed out and was not even cut or served properly, which was extremely disappointing
3
Restaurant is located on the third level of the Fairmont Hotel that is between the linkage to the mall. Convenient location. There is a construction currently taking place just outside of the restaurant and when i was there last evening, there was a loud drilling that started at around 9pm. A little disruption for a nice night out. We had to repeatedly ask for service which is unexpected for a restaurant of this stature. Restaurant was busy for a Tuesday evening resulting in very slow service in an otherwise pleasant gastronomical experience. Tempura and grilled (Robatayaki) dishes were delicious
2
The sashimi is fresh. The service is good but the teppan is bad . Worst than those in the food court . The golden sauce was a signature from ignaniku. Now they called it the golden sauce . But is tasteless. The scallop is soaked in butter . No tepan taste at all. Great start but sad ending .
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday at Mikuni and it was totally awesome. Our table is lucky to be serve by an attentive and friendly staff member - Abegail who made our night more memorable. The quality and freshness of food served was really impressive. Looking forward to return soon
2
We patronised Mikuni yesterday for a casual dinner and had the teppan course. So disappointed with the whole dinner overall. Ingredients used were not fresh...taste and quality was not there... it is definitely not justified for the amount paid. Last night, i woke up from my sleep with diarrhoea, checked with my partner and he was experiencing the same thing. Definitely a drop of standard in my opinion. I was there last year this time and didn't remember it to be that bad. On a side note, the service was not shabby
5
food quality consistently good, staff's attention to detail is impeccable. always a great experience at mikuni.
4
Great mixed sushi platter - 4 types - salmon & tofu salad - always good
Makis & special also good- best of all reasonable at sgd 25-30 a head -
Usually packed on weekends.
Limited parking though!
5
Mikuni is one of my fave Japanese restaurant. Food is excellent & staff is very attentive. Great for business lunch or with friends. Simply awesome!
4
Lovely simple and yet broad menu for lunch. Ambience excellent. Large portions. Service superb. I left content. Good value for money considering the high quality. And very efficient for a time pressured lunch meeting.
2
Nothing to yell about. My wife and I had the premium $120 lunch set & $90 sashimi set. Both were extremely aveage. Certainly at this level of restaurant, the offering lacked any hint of creativity or innovation. In fact, the vegetarian cooked dish in my set was blend. Just a little more effect could have made the vegetable broth a more intense in flavour which would have upgraded that simple dish. The sashimi was fresh but again, not of the better quality cuts & grade.Overall, the sets were not value for money especially when you compare then to other joints such as Suju at Mandarin Galleria or Hakumai. Sure, these two joints are not as highly positioned as Mikuni but the quality vis a vis price is certainly much more value for money & you will come out a lot more satisfied.I will not recommended Mikuni. It's not a restaurant that we will come back to; yes even with a 50â„… Amex discount for 2 persons
4
Visited the restaurant several times, only to order the same few dishes. Try these:1. Lobster fried rice2. Tofu steak3. Sirloin steak Ambience 4/5Nice setting. Lights a little dim though. Table are sufficiently spaced apart. You may try the counter seats viewing on how your food were prepared.Food 4/5Good food. Most dishes are consistently good.Value 3/5 A little pricey unless u have the far card.Service 3/5Nothing spectacular. Classy yes, but not warm
5
Had the Summer Grand Tasting Tour Menu as a birthday celebration which we liked. Service was obliging and discreet as you would expect. Liked that they were obliging towards last minute requests - I forgot to mention during booking that it was a birthday meal.Food wise : The Hokkaido Snow Crab and Miyazaki Wagyu Beef were some of the best we have ever had. The sushi and sashimi dishes were good, but not of the quality one would expect for the price. The abalone was good but lost in the deep fried kushiyai batter. Japanese restaurants are not known for their desserts, but the yoghurt mousse on shisho leaf sobert worked. We are however more won over by the complimentary match tea ice cream
3
My first impression wasn't great. I was kept waiting at the reception whilst the wait staff answered a call. This was despite a q of 4 different parties waiting to be seated. Looking into the restaurant, I didn't see anyone coming to help. Then it was a slow process waiting to be seated whilst the wait staff scrolled through their computer to check bookings. Very disappointing service. I was seated at the robayataki counter because there wasn't an available table. I was okay with that but being tucked away in a corner meant again slow service. The restaurant serves a la carte menu as well as 2 lunch sets: a robayataki set and a teppan set. We each took a different set. My teppan set was okay; not spectacular. The beef was a little tough and the prawns had way too much creamy sauce. The chawamushi was the only dish I was pleased about. The robayataki set was slightly better. The chicken and beef dishes were cooked well. The chicken was especially tender. The corn was barbecued just right. I tried a salmon belly sashimi and that was okay too. But it wasn't as fresh as I expected. Altogether a disappointing visit to a restaurant with so much hype. Service needs mega improvement.

What should I say.... A hungry man is a angry man? Proven again!I was looking forward to the Unagi promotion from Inagiku or now called Mikuni. Even before I went for my business trip I have asked my Wife to book this restaurant on Saturday and I will rush back for it. So she did. She called and make the reservation and was told only available for lunch and ok, we want it and abide to it. We asked if we need to make a reservation for the Unagi set meal and was told no need to, it will be available. So after 10 days of wait, I flew back and so much so I was having a slight fever but for good Unagi, I will crawl there if needed to. Yes, I'm desperate for food, the next big desperation after SxX!Then I was told sorry sir, it is not available!!! "Thunder and lightnings" my face changed and hand shivering- after these 10 days after I barred myself from Japanese food so I can enjoyed this Unagi lunch which they advertised on magazine and various food websites, and tell us they have none available now?!! They are not keeping their words and commitment on the magazine, I flew early back for nothing, and I should lie in my bed to recuperate more...... My Wife felt bad too as she was the one to make the reservation, of course I couldn't blame her as she did what supposed to be done. (Oh, and I love her so much too and she wouldn't kick me out of the room). Anyway, Long story short, we give our feedback to the manager, she was like ok, so no more what you want attitude? Did not even make attempt to retain us. So eventually, we left the restaurant having nothing. Now I am next door at the Sichuan restaurant which they serves good siew mai but that will be another story!So, next time if you are going to this restaurant for a specific food promotion, please be very specific so that you will not go there and be disappointed like me. It will be sometime before I go back there again, when time heal my empty stomach no Unagi wounds. Psst, there are a few more good Jap restaurant than Mikuni in Singapore, let me know if you are interested. Eat Meet We

Mikuni is a pleasant Japanese restaurant in Raffles City. Prices are higher than normal but you do get a better experience. Been several times. These photos were taken in Dec 2015. I don't really like sashimi, so I tend to order cooked dishes. My two favorites are the Lobster with Uni Cream and the wagyu beef udon. The second dish isn't actually listed on the menu, so I usually order wagyu beef don and ask for the rice to be changed to Udon. Yumz. I usually share half the lobster with a friend otherwise all that Uni cream would make one "Jelak", over-satiated. And we can try more dishes

Very good Indeed. I love this restaurant very much. It has a very decent Teppanyaki, Robatayaki and Sashimi/Sushi variety. Overall very impressive and service is good, too.
5
The Uni simply melts marvellously! Left to the restaurant to arrange our meal. Had variety of sashimi with uni. Maki and assorted sushi!
4
Nice atmosphere and food. Service needs to be improved. The food presentation was very good. Pricing was reasonable.
4
Nice ambience. Very fresh food.. Authentic Japanese food, not fusion type. Exquisite display. Nice for romantic dinner when you are willing to spend.
5
From the plating to the taste, there was nothing to fault in this superlative of a restaurant. As we were in a rush, all of us had bentos and easy dishes. The yellow tail carpaccio was excellent.

I have heard of this restaurant serving good Japanese food for sometimes. However, I never have a chance to visit until recently, my friend invited me to have dinner with her. We couldn't decide what to order initially, as the ala carte and set menu were equally attractive! We ordered one set dinner to share and few add ons to come with finally..the dinner set itself sounds so yummilicous! With the very pretty presentation and nicely prepared food, it took me such a long time to finish it up! I must also not forget about the lobster, which was so delicious! I think most important of all, is the sincerity of the chef when preparing food and friendliness of the whole team that makes this Japanese restaurant !

Food was mediocre and slightly overpriced. The service was a let-down where the waiters were inattentive. I did mentioned that it was a birthday celebration, but nothing was done (not even a candle on the dessert served).I ordinarily do not mind splurging on good quality food, however I could not help but feel that the standards in this restaurant are hugely lacking, and are not worth the money paid.
5
Had dinner there tonight with my Friend. The food was fresh. The grilled egg plant and the sea urchin were out of this world. The Flavours the contrast all created a superb dining experience. We topped it with the Italian Red Wine. The staff were very attentive and the ambience perfect for chatting. This is my third time there this year
5
This is a great Japanese restaurant; all dishes were super fresh and tasty, the presentation was also very much appealing.We try the Mikuni grand tasting tour menu (220). The Crispy Abalone Tempura Sesame Liver Sauce, Lime, Black Garlic was very testy and the Ayu Fish Shioyaki, Ginger Flower, Sweet Corn, Sweet Potato is quite messy to eat (but definitely worth it)Excellent, attentive service and personalized! The ambience a little bit too dark for my personal taste.Would go back there with no hesitation
3
I have dined at the teppanyaki section a few times, the food is usually good and consistent. However, for the prices that Mikuni charges, unfortunately there were a few points that I felt could be improved from my recent experiences. For instance, the garlic rice was pre-fried and served to customers later. For such prices and billing itself as a top end Japanese restaurant- one would expect the chefs to fry the rice in front of guests. Have dined at other teppanyaki restaurants around the world that are in the low price ranges and even they do the frying with more theatrical entertainment like a good teppanyaki should be than at Mikuni! Was a tad disappointed to see no frying 'tricks' nor much interaction from the chefs with the guests.. And especially when the fried garlic rice seemed to come from a pot that was pre fried.
5
A very elegant and beautifully designed restaurant. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and efficient.
5
My 10th time to Mikuni!
Excellent excellent!
We thoroughly enjoyed the Kurobuta pork, Miyazaki wagyu beef, and grilled chicken in 1 platter...
Of course my fav Mikuni Maki and Lobster with sea urchin
5
Location Fairmont hotel Singapore.service very good .food top quality fishes .nicely decorated good place for business
1
Baked cheese lobster with uni cream, King crab fried rice and garlic fried rice was served cold. Attitude of staff who attended to us was horrid.
4
Service was efficient; staff always made sure to refill glasses, clear empty/used plates and made sure we were enjoying our dinner. Also made recommendations based on our preferences and forewarned us about serving portions (almost made the mistake of ordering too much because we assumed the portions would be much smaller)Food comes in generous portions; flavorful and well-plated. We enjoyed the pairing of foie gras and pineapples very much, it was a balanced combination between sweet and savory. Scallop soup was clear but naturally flavorful.In general, the place was quiet and pleasant to hold private conversations in. However I would prefer if it was more well-li
5
We chose the Robata Lunch Set and Teppan Lunch Set at Mikuni, the Fairmont Hotel. Both were value for money and would actually serve well for a quick executive/power lunch. IMHO, the Teppan Set is better than the Robata Set as it has a delicious King Prawn, miso-marinated cod and generous chunks of Australian tenderloin. I say this even though the Robata Set has a yummy Hokkaido scallop, Atka Mackerel from Kyushu and unfortunately too small a portion of Kagoshima Wagyu Beef. I didn't really enjoy the Kurobuta Pork Tsukune and Kyoto-Style Herring Soba. Service was excellent - attentive yet unintrusive and unhurried. Highly recommended
5
Been to many Japanese restaurant and this one certainly has plenty of class, professional service and great food! The seatings and lighting in this restaurant is very comfortable and cozy. No noisy kids or noisy customers. Service staff very polite and goes about silently refilling water and wine glasses. For a restaurant of this class I expected the price to be much much steeper but I was certainly surprised. It was fine dining but doesnt break the bank! Food was well presented and there wasnt anything that can be faulted!! The grilled lobster was delicious, the softshell crab light and crunchy, everything was done with attention and perfection. One of the best meals I have eaten in a Japanese restaurant and a very nice setting/ambience!
5
This high level Japanese restaurant is located inside the Fairmont Hotel in Marina Bay. Ambient is elegant and booking is suggested.I had a la carte teppanyaki and was superb: Lobster, Australian beef and a unique Foie gras. Price is on high range but quality is superior.Staff is very attentive and very professional
5
We enjoyed our last meal very much so decided to treat our family here. Food was good but I like to comment that the service staff (Hui Ern) was very attentive to little details of her customers. I was coughing at a stage and she immediately turned up to ask if I needed warm water to soothe my throat, which really made our meal time very pleasant. Will definitely return
5
Fantastic and elegant environment to enjoy one of the several specialities offered by this fine dining Restaurant.From Sushi table, teppanyaki, robayaki or table you will have a super food experience.Service is very kind and the Sashimi, wagyu steak and the lobster are superlative.Must Try if you stop in Singapor
3
Getting bored with the same food. Need more variety. Suggest monthly specials and promotions. GreenTea at $5 per head is high.
5
Be prepared for high end pricing. The squid and oyster starters were very good as was the soft shell crab maki. Wahyu teppanyaki also v good but pricey.
5
Excellent food and service!
The sushi is really so good that every time I'm here I'll order the Mikuni Make right away!
Very friendly servers and they are very attentive.
Every single item in the menu is cooked to perfection... always makes me happy
4
Nice place, great food, the prawn teppanyaki, the fresh seafood, garlic fried rice, pork belly teppanyaki, etc... Enjoy sitting at the teppanyaki counter and watch the fire shows by the Chef
5
The food was superb but what made the visit great was the attentive service! Perfect for a special ocassion
4
Ambience is very good. Can be better if butter is used and fry with garlic which make the food tastier and not too oily.
Hope Mikuni will maintain the traditional teppanyaki cooking.
2
Went for a birthday celebration. It was all going well at first when the food was up to their usual standard. However, the robatayaki platter that was our last course was served cold with the salmon being way over cooked. The service was professional at all times thoug
4
We ordered the set lunches- a sashimi set and an Australian steak set- which came with a salad, crackers, a custard dessert and some green tea dusted pralines and red bean squares. The food was good, but the price was about 2 and a half to 3 times what you would pay elsewhere. Did the food justify the price? To be honest, not really. But the service was impeccable, and the service staff members are really the stars of the restaurant. If they lower the price by half, they would have gotten 5 stars in my books.
4
Place was packed on a weekend afternoon, but service was prompt. The special lunch menu ranges from 70 ~ 120SGD, with many types of sets to fit everyone. I had the sashimi set which was 80SGD, came with 10 pieces of assorted sashimi. One of them, (I think mackerel) tasted absolutely vile and fishy, a personal dislike I suppose! Very beautifully plated and served up.I shan't comment on the value or price, it is its own niche. Although some may say it is unfathomably pricey compared to sushi chains or other restaurants, there are also toyotas and cadillacs. Service was very polite and prompt, the only issue I had with the two waitresses that served us was the accent. Don't get me wrong, the Singaporean waitress was on the ball, but she had to repeat all her statements various times before I could understand. I am a local myself, but couldn't even understand when I was asked to choose between tap water, still water or sparkling water
4
Tried the teppan lunch set (OCBC promo) recently and it left me wanting for more.The set included a salad, spicy crackers (loved this!), the teppan mains which were beef, prawns and cod fish, as well as miso soup and dessert (milk pudding topped with fruits).Service was good, especially the gentleman (I forgot to get his name) who squeezed a slot in for us, asked AND listened to our feedback with a genuinely concerned face as we were about to leave the restaurant.Thumbs up
4
Service is good. Food quality is good as well except a bit pricey. The atmosphere there is good. Was there for a business dinner with overseas colleagues and they like the place
4
We came here for Teppanyaki dinner, I have never tried the sushi here.
Same chef from the last iteration of this establishment, (Inagiku I believe). Skillful and friendly chef.
Meats were hearty, well executed.
Good that quality has remained consistent over the past 8? years.
3
The restaurant ambiance is very good.
The service is also very peasant and efficient.
The food is definitely a disappointment.
My sashimi was fresh but very average flavour.
Not worth the high prices.
4
Excellent sashimi ; rest of bento v good. All at about $120 for a premium bento lunch. Would come again.
5
Best Japanese restaurant in town. Everything is more than perfect starting from service, presentation, atmosphere, taste, menu and so on. I would give 10/10. 👍🏾
4
Singapore now days is quite expensive, so eating quality Japanese doesn't help. The restaurant has a nice decor (dark and "moody") -I sat at the sushi bar and received efficient and friendly service.
4
It's about girls and dolls on hina matsuri, a day traditionally celebrate in japan on 3rd march when families who daughters success and happiness in life.Chef Moon Kyung Soo's prepare a lunch bento for $120 ++ from 1st to 10th march.I saw the advertisement in the straits time on friday, I thought well look interesting.It was not a disappointment indeed. (lucky)The staff is friendly and the food was super the presentation is so impressive, we wanted to take the treasure box back but of cause not allow. My friend and I really enjoy the lunch.Good job Mikuni Happy customers.Starter we had glass of amazake (yogurt with sake) japanese green salad, main elegant 3 tier box, pulling out each drawer housed edible gems.There was truffle kanpachi sashimi, truffle soy sauce.2nd drawer consist of 8 japanese appetizers such as grill miso cod, unagi, tamago, abalone, cute quail egg, eel, octopus, umeboshi plum and japanese pickles.The 3rd drawer uni chirashi don, seaweed, shrimp, miyazaki wagyu beef on rice, tamago. There ws also mix tempura (prawn, sweet potato, fish, pumpkin and green bean)Dessert shizoka musk melon, salted ice cream.But of cause all serving is very mini so even sound a whole lots of foods is manageable
5
All 6 courses of the spring set dinner at $120 per person was awesome. The sashimi, tempura and the fish courses were so very good. Only "complaint" was that the rice in the last course was a tad too soft. Service was attentive. Surprise bonus was that using the Amex platinum card got us 50% off for food and 25% off for drinks. This is so for Sundays and Mondays. We are definitely returning.
3
Was there on a 1-for-1 offer. Tried both the Teppanyaki set and the Robatayaki set. Personal preference is the Robatayaki set, as it's less oily and less salty. Loved the wagyu beef on the Robatayaki set but not the Teppanyaki set. Price is not cheap if there's no offer. And set menu is too much for a small eater like me. Restaurant has a strong smoky smell because of the all the grilling I guess. Btw, the cocktail I selected is too sweet..
5
To be frank, the price is relatively high. But the quality of the food is excellent. If you have money to spend and you are in for a nice treat, this is definitely the place to be. I have been to Japan a couple of times, and basically this restaurant serves high quality Japanese food, in fact even better than some restaurant in Japan. I suggest you try the sake as well. They have a few interesting sake which is quite unique and refreshing. Definitely a place to be for a nice meal and great drinks
4
Came here for lunch today with a colleague and we both opted for the sashimi lunch set. Quality was very good with really fresh fish. Very good service. Prices are a little steep if you're paying personally.
5
loved the sashimi lunch set which included everything from miso soup, cawanmushi, to desert! Sashimi was fresh and sashimi pieces were thick and succulent
4
Good vibes with this place. Thoug seating pretty close. Dessert may be too sweet. Overall good and patient service. If they can have an omakase menu, even better.
4
Mikuni Japanese Restaurant is located at Raffles City. If you are going by MRT, you will stop at City Hall. The food was fresh and delicious. We had sushi, sashimi and teppanyaki. Looking at the chef in action at the teppanyaki counter was quite entertaining. The decor is quite mysterious with a dark colour theme. Probably to stimulate your senses before your meal. The prices are not cheap so be prepared to spend at least S$150 per head. Overall good experience.
5
We celebrated our daughter's birthday with dinner at this always consistently excellent Japanese restaurant. I can still recall the first time i was hosted here to a tempura lunch by a Japanese diplomat who was then posted in Singapore. That initial great first impression for the care that the chefs here place on serving excellent food has remained. For my children, this was their first experience at this restaurant. We had an excellent Chef's omakase which was excellent in allowing the full range of Japanese favorites from tempura to sashimi to their brilliant beef. The table setting is always wonderfully set so that you have your own privacy and the lightings make for a classy setting. Most important of all given the occasion, my daughter loved the meal
4
Came with a friend who is regular customer, so we got a table. In case you don't do advance booking, it can be full. Everything is delicious. We eat several dishes a la carte. The different Unagi are wonderful. Presentation is great. The place is cosy. We will come back for sur
5
I decided to go to this restaurant as I was staying at the Swissotel and they recomended it. I made a last minute booking and asked to sit at the eating bar as I was travelling by myself. - the eating bar is Always a great option if you travel solo as it's quite entertaining to see them preparing the food.The staff was great and the waitress was able to make nice recomendations after a couple of initial questions. I settled for some miso soup, green tea and black cod with steamed rice and veggies. The black cod was amazing, marinated and cooked to perfection! - I didn't order dessert but they included a complimentary ice cream.Taking into account that I didn't have any alcohol, the bill came up to around Â£50.I'd defo go back again
5
In Spore, during work week most fine dining restaurant offers great business set lunch. This is one way to enjoy the good food of such restaurant without breaking the budget. So do check it out. If you would like to enjoy fine dining Japanese set lunch, I recommend Mikuni if you are in the area. Food is really good. The sashimi was so fresh and I like it that they were not stingy as they were slice thick so you can enjoy every mouthful. Our set lunch also comes with dessert which was really nice
5
Went to #mikuni for dinner. The dishes were very delicately and tastefully done. We had a cold dish, green salad and a hot dish, Tofu as starters. Very nice. And I ordered my main dish - beef don. It was very juicy n fresh. And the service staff were very polite and attentive too. Give it a try!
4
This is one of the best Japanese restaurants here, of course, there are certainly better ones but this is probably in the top five or so restaurants.The food especially sashimi is fresh and of quality. The slicing is not too thin and considered thick.The service is professional but lack a bit of customer touch.Please reserve table even if you are dropping for weekday lunch. However if you do not mind a counter seat walk in will do.Will definitely patronize again for the food
5
Good food, fantastic plating and spectacular service describe this favorite Japanese place of ours. The flavours of each dish was delicately balanced, service was very attentive without being too obtrusive and playing superb.
5
Excellent service...nice authentic Japanese food, value for money. Our family favourite Japanese restaurant.
5
It was a great dining experience with lovely staff. The food was good with top quality fresh produce. Besides all that the staff gave good recommendation of the menu selection.
4
~my wife had a meal there with her FAR card it was 50% off for 2 so she'd made a reservation for us to try it~It's an amazing 3 separate areas you could dine in and for dinner it was fully packed in all 3 of them for Sushi, Teppanyaki and main dining~we were impressed with the barman who was also serving us that evening, he'd recommended some items on the menu that my wife tired and took a liking to eg ginger flower & baked ginko nuts~my wife ordered the 8 course Matsutake with Sake pairing and it could not have been more sumptuous a meal! ~I'd ordered ala carte Gindara Miso Yaki Don & Kurobuta Pork Katsu, the Japanese waiter had suggested I not take this combo as it was too heavy and both not complementary but I did and both were very appetizing YUMzI've added comments to the photos, and even with the FAR discount it is on the pricey side so I'd go for special occasions :
5
Been to Mikuni several times and was never disappointed before. Tried the set lunch and dinner menu as well as the sake there. Personally, I've not had better Japanese food in Singapore. But do make a booking as it's full most of the time. Also, if you have a Feed-at-raffles (FAR) card, it's good value for money
5
Excellent quality for the good and service. The set lunches are yummy with pretty presentations. The teppanyaki is a treat with the chef cooking right infront. Decor is pretty as well. Only thing is that it can get pricey. Great if you have the FAR card.
3
Is a must to make reservation to avoid disappointment. It is because the location is at business district and near by there are few hotels. I called many times, but always put me onhold, so I decided to walk-in. It was full, so I waited for about 15 minutes.I had summer set lunch menu (5 course) which serve Unagi (85% of the food is unagi). it was my first time eating unagi bone. I will prefer the unagi could be slightly fatter (understand that people prefer less fat unagi, unlike Japanese, the unagi normally is about 400-500g). It comes with 3 kinds starters, 3 kinds of sashimi, seafood salad, unagi rice, pickles, miso soup and dessert = $120++
4
Mikuni in Japanese means 3 countries. Mikuni is a good choice for Japanese restaurant in Singapore in terms of quality and price. You can enjoy wide range of menu to accomodate different needs of guests and the service is very solid and professional. Very easy access for tourists as well as locals. Sushi is served very nicely at the counter. If you want to try traditional and proper Japanese food, Mikuni ranks quite high in the list

We stayed at Fairmont hotel for our recent visit to Singapore. I'm Japanese living overseas so we often go to a Japanese restaurant wherever we go. We read the reviews of this restaurant before we decided to go there. Most of the reviews were excellent so we expected that everything would be good. We found the food very average - nothing special for Japanese standard. I don't mind paying a high price for an outstanding meal, but nothing was outstanding and everything was over priced. I've never paid $15 for a simple Edamame anywhere else in the world!! Our mains didn't arrive all at the same time. My daughter ordered a bowl of rice to have it with the main. Her rice didn't arrive with the main so we had to ask a staff and even then, it took a while to get the rice. By the time she got the rice, her main was cold. My main arrived around the time my husband finished his meal. We ordered miso soups and the timing of bringing the miso soups were wrong too. It's hard to understand why this restaurant is getting good reviews. We were so unhappy with our experience and would not recommend to anyone
4
My husband and I have not been back to this restaurant ever since they changed from Inagiku to Mikuni years ago. The reason - the last meal he had at Inagiku gave him severe food poisoning and we eventually found out that he was probably allergic to sea urchin. So when we made a booking this time, we made sure we let the staff know about it and they really took great pains to recommend alternative dishes to the tasting menu we both ordered. The dishes were brought out in perfect timing, all delectable and sumptuous.The highlight of the courses was the grilled unagi kabayaki on rice. Service was excellent and attentive, without being too imposing. The restaurant setting was a teeny bit too dark for our liking but clearly it is popular given the number of diners there on a weekday night
4
Housed in the Fairmont Hotel, this modern restaurant serves a good selection of authentic Japanese cuisine. Great for business meals.
4
If all you know about Japanese Food is Sushi and Miso Soup then treat yourself to a table here. Again, its either the people of Singapore or staff at The Fairmont but the people here were extremely friendly. Eating out at its best!
4
This place isn't cheap but the sashimi quality, sake and service are very good. Good for dates, parents and civilized small groups. With sake, it was about $150-200 per person.
5
Mikuni is a big but intimate restaurant with varied spaces for different Japanese cuisine styles. Set in a black elegant decor but non-pretentious. We had Robotayaki......the freshest imported ingredients, seafood etc. Put simply, the food was exquisite. And the wine list was extensive but go for the sake menu....we had three different cold sake ....just delicate and refined. We had several dishes, my favourites were the Hokkaido scallops, sea urchin with something....oysters with citrus butter...and more. Service was great, helpful and polite. Highly recommended
5
Been to Mikuni several times for business lunch or dinner and has been great. Went there for lunch just now to celebrate my hubby's birthday. Food is tasty and presentation of the set lunch is marvelous. Even the carrot for my business set lunch is cut into the shape of Sakura flower. A lot of little fine details that adds to the experience.Mentioned his birthday when I made reservation via email. So the petite service staff arranged for yummy black sesame ice cream with a candle for him. Since our set lunch comes with espresso ice cream which I do not take, she changed one of it into cut fruits. I am very impressed by her service and initiative that ended the lunch with a sweet note. Definitely one of my must go place for birthday celebration
4
This is a great restaurant to take people for business or pleasure. It's one of the few that serves the complete range of Japanese cooking styles from Sushi & Sashimi to Teppanyaki, and all of them really good. It is a big restaurant with sections for each style, and options to dine at counter or at a private table. Whatever your preference, be sure and ask for an order of Teppan Prawns with Golden Sauce, a restaurant specialty item for many, many years!
4
We took the set dinner menu and enjoyed every mouthful from the first to the last. As you would expect from a top Japanese restaurant the presentation of each dish was excellent.Service wasn't as good as the best places in Japan or London but was the best we had in Singapore with attentive staff but they didn't have the awareness of needs. An example is that we ordered cocktails for drinks and then Saki but the cocktails took a while to arrive that meant we were already on course 3 before we had need of saki, so we cancelled it. Shame really as that was the only minor negative of the entire time we spent there (just over two hours well spent in my book
5
...every now and again due to the cost for me but if I could I'd come back here on a weekly basis, the variety of lunch sets are out of this world you will see you're spoilt for choice. For me the service has never failed me, always very attentive and the most important for me is the freshness of the fish/seafood... sake selection very good... always spot on. If you are looking to celebrate a special occasion I think you'll find Mikuni one that'll be remembered
5
Hokkaido Scallop with onion butter sauce, king shrimp with special sauce, Kagoshima Wagyu, Kurobata pork Tsukune. Sitting at the Teppan counter of Mikuni and watching your food being cooked while you sip sake. Mikuni's Teppan and Robata (grill) set was several courses of perfection, served in an elegant setting. As close as you get to Japan! Strongly recommended. More pictures and details here at http://dubeersdrc.com/2015/04/13/review-lunch-at-mikun

I share a passion to ensure restaurants that have been GREAT on my list - we have now been here approx 5 times in last 7 months; I must say that the food we savoured (just last night) was good BUT not great- something is lacking with regards to the "freshness" of the seafood. Service was good BUT again it was GREAT before. Not a complain here BUT its fair to say that the previous posts on concern around food and servic
5
This is a great Japanese restaurant, all dishes were super fresh and tasty. They also have special Fugu dishes, and even Fugu tasting menu. Service was perfect.
5
I have lived in Japan, notably in Osaka, which is renowned for its restaurants, and I must say that this is one of the best Japanese meals I have ever had. The dishes were all prepared to perfection, and each service was more pleasing to the eye than the next, This is an absolute must for those craving a taste of real Japan in southeast Asia
4
The rating is more for the service rather than the food.The servers were attentive and I like the service.Food wise, it's not that bad as some reviewers claimed. It's slightly above average. Price wise, do expect to pay what you would normally pay to dine in a 5* hotel establishment

29/3/15 went to celebrate my daughter birthday. Being to mikuni before was happy though price was on the high side. The food does not taste Japanese now the lobster & scallop was so oily cook with too much butter and no garlic as my last visit the lobster, scallops was good that's why I order again for my daughter. We order the sashimi 7 variety 3pcs each for $190. The piece was rather small ( not worth the money) I order the wagyu beef $78 came in 2 satay stick each pc was about 1 inch length less than half inch thick and all fats u cannot taste meat at all. My husband said is horrible he refuse to eat. I bought wagyu beef before was nothing like what mikuni serve. The lobster $$48 each I order 2 set they were very buttery make u sick my daughter only eat half a pc . The scallop $32 slice into very thin pcs was swimming in the shell very oily. We had sake, salmon skin sushi total bill was $634 is the worse meal we had. I will never return again.The restaurant must have change the cook the standard of cooking is not there ,it was really horrible sushi tei any time taste better and alot more cheaper, if mikuni management don't wake up they will eventually suffer. Not because no customer, no staff, high rental, is because they didn't keep up to the food standard and charge so high price. I'm a food lover, Ive try lots and lots of good food I'll tell u if is value for money or whether worth eating.I felt I just throw away few hundred dollar
5
First visit to this restaurant. Tried the teppanayaki set dinner. There is 2 set - $158 & $300. Decided to go for the $158 set. Good portion. There are 5 dishes in total. Starting with some appetitiser, followed by 3 types of seasonal sashimi which I must say was fresh & good. The next best dish was the king prawn in golden sauce which was really tasty. Next up was the Australian wagyu which I felt was only average. Another disappointment was the garlic fried rice which tasted real normal. I must say I had tasted much fragrant garlic fried rice in other normal Japanese restaurant. Last was the dessert. One thing to commend is the great service of the staffs
5
Visited Mikuni as recommended by a close local friend of mine and the night did not disappoint. service was prompt and polite and also the food was quite good. There was nothing to complain about and the servers also had great knowledge to explain each dish. The manageress was also able to recommend us a great sake to compliment the dishes. Great experience and the price was reasonable for a hotel. Will be back again when we crave sake
3
Expensive as usual in Japanese restaurants, but lacking in atmosphere. It seemed to be short of waiting staff as the waiters and waitresses were were rushed off their feet. My wife's water failed to arrive.Food was average, nothing special, and my garlic fried rice bore a strong resemblance to Chinese egg fried rice.Overall we were a bit disappointed and shall not return.
4
I've been to the restaurant 3 times. Love the food. They have a few sets for lunch and dinner catering for to propel with different preferences.Service level is amazing. Waiter and waitress are so patient and attend to our every need. Food is served at the right pace.The menu gets updated once in a while so we can get new dishes for different visits. A bit on the high side if you are not on Amex Far Card. I'm so I'm very happy to pay 50% for such great food. The only problem is that serving quantity is not huge so some people might come out not feeling full
1
1. Server took 10 mins to serve us water. Unacceptable. It should be the first thing done right after we sit down. 2. Our food was ready and sent to the counter waiting to be delivered to our table. However, 5 different servers noticed the food, walked right past it and went on with their more important duties such as refilling the water jug, folding of napkins and the worse of all, three of them congregated right behind my food and started chatting. This is totally UNACCEPTABLE. a. Is there such a rule that only my designated server can serve me my food? What about the rest of the team? There is clearly no team work here and something needs to be done about. Btw, I am comparing this to Prego's fantastic teamwork. They have a bigger crowd to handle and they always manage to pull it of effortlessly with a smile. Mikuni? Unacceptable. Servers lack the passion. No smile, no attention to details, just get the job done and move on.b. At the end of my meal, I had to remind the my designated server to serve the petite fours. So tell me, who works at Mikuni? Me or the server? c. Food: My Wagyu don arrived cold. Already disappointed by the service, I have no intention to pursue this further. I just want to end my unpleasant dining experience here. Am I going to pay $50 for a cold rice bowl next time? Probably not. d. This is not my first time at Mikuni, and the service standards have been dropping every time I pop by. Chances of me revisiting Mikuni again? Very slim

I have eaten here many many times, and each time I am back I felt all the more that there is too much hype to it.I have seen much better food presentations elsewhere for around the price if not slightly more. In terms of food quality, nothing really unique. Their set lunches are popular but I doubt that it is call for money. Sashimi slices are like bite size where I can more generous helpings at other similar places.Service wise, I ordered a smoke toro and it never came. They didn't bill for it either, so obviously this was an issue with order taking. Lastly I was greeted with a comment that they were trying to reach me over the phone as I was late getting there. I really don't see the point of saying that if the customer has already turned up (albeit late, my fault). I don't think a) you want to remind a customer he is late not when the place wasn't full b) say that to his face first thing instead of saying welcome to Mikuni.Adding insult to injury, my smoked toro never arrived

The food has unique and exquisite taste. The presentation is also very nice. The ambience was relaxing and service is good. It might be a bit pricey though.

My good friend bought me there to celebrate my belated birthday. As she is a regular there I left the ordering to her. We had lobster uni taking ($48) robatayaki Hokkaido scallop ($32 for 2 PCs) one each , salmon skin sushi (6PCs $20) garlic fried rice one portion $12 , grill asparagus, & dessert . The food is fresh and the taste is good, they even gave us a compliment miso soup each to our surprise. The waiter (Jonathan) was amazing without any instructions when he heard certain dish that we sharing he divide very nicely for us I'm impress. Later came the incharge Mr Kim when he heard we celebrating a belated birthday he sent a green tea ice cream with a candle & a birthday card make of chocolate, this is how friendly the service is . Lovely meal pleasant people. We visit again on special occasion

Our stay over the weekend in Fairmont hotel brought us in advance reservation for a dinner, we ordered the set dinner meal special for autumn with mini taro n kobe steak,every dish was well presented though as in Japanese standard all serving are mimi but one can be satisfied after getting to the dessert. Being there couple of times mainly for lunch
5
Great teppanyaki experience with nice chef showing his skills with superb produce.We were a group of five people and all had the teppanyaki menu. Also possible to order individual dishes from Ã -la-carte. Fresh ingredients; sea urchin, sashimi, giant prawns, wagyu beef. The dishes concentrate on the ingredient itself - no big amounts of spices or gravies. Just the real taste of the fresh stuff. The wagyu steak was prepared perfectly and had tasty small dips to try out and was the real star of the whole menu.They have a wonderful menu for sakes and serve them hot & cold. When ordering cold they keep it in ice. I think cold sake and Japanese beer suit best a teppanyaki experience

It is a modern Japanese restaurant that has both traditional Japanese food and fusion Japanese food. Japanese is one of my fav choice when I travel bc it never goes wrong as long as it is fresh. There are two dishes that I always order when I go to Japanese restaurant, one is Sushi and the other one is Tendon (assorted tempura with steam rice) if they have. Bc... I like them and food to test whether I like this restaurant or not. Sushi platter at price of $110 was very satisfied. They are fresh as I expect. Tendon was so so, considering it was $40 but the shrimp was nice. We also ordered other food, recommended by the staff - sorry that I dont remember what we ordered - they are all satisfied.I will def come back to explore more food here!

Love dining at Mikuni, the place is located in the heart of town, of course you should be prepared to pay for such dinners. No doubt it pricey but you should be aware of that before dining. Chirashi don is really good with a wide variety for $90, comes with 2 slices of otoro, salmon, tuna and scallops and some other fishes which I can't recall, it comes with a huge amaebi too! Rice was dense and flavorful. Wagyu beef don, $48 was value for money, comes with cubes of Wagyu beef which melts in your mouth and a crispy egg with a watery yolk which we usually break into our rice.Wagyu foie gras gyoza, 3 pcs $28 worth every bite! Good to try!Service staff here is very friendly and constantly checking on us, wanted to chill the wine for awhile and staff constantly check if we wanted to drink it already. Pretty good and top notch service I'll sayA place we love to dine on special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries.

.The Wagu Beef will melt and disintegrate in your mouth and the King Prawn in special sauce make it one of its kind in Singapore. (been to many good Japaneses restaurant but so far did not mange find another one as good now in Singapore).The Teppan Master, Eric adds his personal touches to the food. Making the Meal a pleasant and enjoyable one. He is able to balance between the look, the food taste and also the soup so that the meal is a pleasant one I think the meal at the Teppanyaki counter is really worth it
5
This restaurant serves the more unusual and authentically jap dishes. If it's 2 people, recommend to order one season course set and top a starter and main dish to share. Currently in Dec, they are serving the autumn course, offering ingredients that are avail during autumn. There are also teppanyaki and robotayaki counters avail for your choosing which I've yet tried. Dinner will set you back by a few hundred. If you share like what I did, it's about $250 - $300. Autumn cost $158+++ but it's really delicious and allow you to try various dishes.

We had lunch here. The venue was quite popular. The food was excellent however was not cheap for lunch. I had a business bento and my colleagues had sashimi sets. My colleagues said for some reason they were quite heavy handed with the wasabi on the sushi which was quite odd. The restaurant was also a bit too noisy due to very loud Christmas music. Generally a good experience overall
5
This is not only a Sushi bar, it is a cozy restaurant within a shopping center and hotel complex. The freshest fish and the friendliest service. A solid wine menu, not overpriced.. Beautiful decoration. A place to come back any time. We probably had the nicest waiters of all Asia
5
Fresh food, nice ambience, good service. Will return for more... Especially good if you have FAR card, gets super good discounts....
4
Mikuni offerings of modern Japanese cuisine where non-traditional ingredients are used without compromising the original essence of Japanese cuisine. I like corn and pork belly.
5
Still good as Inagiku - we really enjoyed as a family. Best Japanese food. Dislike - it a hidden from Hotel Lobby.
4
Very good food and ambient. But if you want to eat at the Teppanyaki counter, you better call and reserve a seat. The prawn and beef is so fresh and tender...There is also a segment where they serve Robataki Prices are quite expansive....but the quality of the food make up for it.I may visit again in the near futur
4
Mikuni, great dining place for an experience of Japanese well respected cultural cusine, however, beware your wallet, it might be very costly and I mean it, really for what you order...the bill might goes for $1xxx plus even without wine just for two to dine...but respectively and understandable, it is so pricey for the stock they do serve even on the cost they purchase here locally...anyway, the overall experience is great, compact and delightfully flavoured Japanese gastronomique indulgence but the service is not excellence as what they priced for...maybe shall I put it as if you order something which is $$$$ in menu, you will be serve differently with the price that you ordered $$ ... to me, every guests shall be serve equally, should there be any difference, VIP rooms or VIP tag guests then shall be serve with this service. Anyway, Mikuni as a fine Japanese restaurant shall have a fine japanese service as of a real Japanese environment...I mean a traditional typical Japanese feels to lift up to what you want to be a range of highly class standard

Decided to have lunch here with business colleagues per a friend’s recommendation. Given the S$120 list price I had expected so much more from the PREMIUM BENTO “MIYABI” that I ordered. Serving sizes were absolutely pathetic for the price paid and while the quality was good, we left still feeling hungry. My experience of description per the menu Organic Salad = collection of no more than 10 leavesKyoto Onion Soup = barely half full small bowl of soupGrilled Kagoshima Wagyu Beef = two cubes of beef on a skewer3 kinds of Sashimi = two slices each of tuna toro, salmon and a white fish BBQ Eel on Rice = small bowl which didn’t taste any better than what Sushi Tei had to offerMixed Tempura = less that 5 providedTeppanyaki Prawns with Golden Sauce = two prawnsDessert = tea cup size of ice crea

The wife and I had the autumn set. food was excellent and very well presented. The portions were however a tad small and we had to order a bowl of udon to fill ourselves up. Service was excellent though I was surprised that we were offered green tea and subsequently charged for it. I expected to have been told that it was chargeable before placing the order especially as tea is usually free at most Japanese restaurants. All in a very good experience
5
Quality wise, I would say hands down that this was one of the finest Japanese cuisines I've had worldwide. I'm one of those people who typically will only have salmon or tuna sashimi but the sashimi platter was so fantastic I just and to try everything - and I enjoyed it too. Presentation was excellent. My parents ordered the seasonal set menus and were completely impressed - and they aren't easy people to impress. They also had an excellent selection of sake.Service was excellent. Special thanks to our waitress Jessica who provided just the right about attention without overdoing it as many wannabe's tend to do. Something which is often overlooked is the pace at which food was brought out which I felt was also perfectly timed. Ms Yun who wasn't our waitress was also kind enough to help us with some photography (and put some effort into it too).This restaurant has 2 private dining rooms, 1 with a Tepanyaki table and 1 without (the one I booked). Lighting is slightly dim so I would also recommend it for couples. My recommendation is that guests coming here should realise that it is a dining experience that you are paying for with quality food, service and ambiance. Be aware that for things like that, one should expect to pay top dollar. One of the things that I did struggle with was contacting the restaurant directly for the reservation as it goes through the hotel's central booking. Diane was kind enough to respond with confirmations on the restaurants behalf. I would highly recommend this restaurant for private functions of 5-7 people (min spend 150/pax food spend not including drinks and tax). they were also very accommodating with my 2 small children Again, one of the best dining experiences Ive had
2
visited Mikuni twice, despite reservation by F&B Chef, only one seat left so my wife should have eaten elswhere? made reservation at 6:30 which is opening time, yet both times had to wait because staff had still to meet, cannot understand why staff meeting where they have all day is more important than customers, this plus no seat for my wife we left for Sezuan Restaurant where the staff took excellent care of us.Also the Mikuni staff seemed to be very cold and not welcoming, especially compared to the Chinese Restaurant at Fairmont.The food ok, I ordered Sukiyaki the first visit yet disapointing too, very little almost no onions and other vegetables, looked more like an appetizer.Have to mention that Nick the F&B director was not happy about our treatment and took care of our bill in Sezuan which was a nice gesture, but I rather had a good experience at Mikuni, sorr

Mikuni provides an excellent environment for private dining. You get to choose from a la carte and set meal options. The prices may be a bit more steeper than what you get from mass market options, but then again, Mikuni is not your ordinary Japanese restaurant. The food arrangement and layout are excellent, from my point of view. The food quality is excellent - the sashimi is definitely fresh. This place is perfect for dining for couples, or for business discussions, or for celebrations
4
We had a sashimi starter plate, which was very nice and fresh too. We ordered a selection of sushi's and some of the sweet potato teriyaki (amazing) The service was good and the ambiance. Try their pink champagne too !!!
4
Better than otherwise I suppose! This place has three chefs including a robotaki specialist. But it's the appetisers especially the sushi that wins it for me. Worthwhile is the apple wood smoked tuna and their unago eel.
2
My hubby is a Japanese delicacy foodie and I can tell u Mikuni served expensive yet not up-to-mark-quality food. We ordered kurobuta which turned out a big chunk of disgusting meat.
That was my first last visit, really!
4
Good quality Japanese food is hard to come by in Singapore. There are many restaurants that claim that they serve good quality Japanese food and charge you ridiculously high prices. However, Mikuni is one exception. This was one of the best Japanese dinners that I have had in Singapore. The food was fantastic! A must-try is the Mikuni Chirashi and the Homemade Hiyashi Tofu. The tempura served here is also probably one of the better ones in Singapore; the batter is crispy and not too thick. Price performance-wise, this place is pretty reasonable. They may charge you slightly higher prices, but the quality and quantity of each dish served justifies this
4
We love Japanese food and we have not been disappointed. There had been a large party in the Restaurant - nevertheless our food was brought without any delay. We enjoyed as a starter edamame beans and ate later avocado rolls and tuna sashimi. Overall a nice place for a Japanese dinner
5
We went for dinner with some friends, the food was amazing, is little bit expensive but food is out of this world. The lobster just spectacular, the sushi and tepanyaki too and the squid also, its difficult to choose the best plate, the vanilla ice cream was good too. We paid about $ 100 per perso
4
I visit the restaurant once in a while, primarily for the freshness of their ingredients, which to me is of paramount importance in Japanese cuisine. Preparation on the other hand seems to have slipped in standards. I had the King Prawn lunch set on my most recent visit, but the shrimp was over done. However, I'd always recommend their sashimi. Shall stick to this henceforth
5
dinners at mikuni are always so very enjoyable. see recent post on a wonderful mikuni dinner on 31.3.2014.we were there again on 23.6.2014. this time we ordered the chirashi don, oysters & golden prawns, in addition to the usual.the oysters were good. at 50% discounts, it was S$14 for 3 pieces. the ones we had recently at chikuwatei was better but more ex – 2 large ones for S$22. the chirashi don was so, so very nice. this must the best in singapore or anywhere for S$45++ after 50% feed at raffles (FAR) discounts. :-) needless to say, it was far, far better than sun with moon or chikuwatei. not only there was uni, 2 pieces of chu toro, & a huge botan ebi, all the other cuts like salmon, tai, hamachi, hotate were so sweet & fresh & so very many. it was kind of a late discovery for us, as we dined quite a bit at mikuni but we tend to take the cooked food rather than sashimi.we had the usual botan ebi sashimi (S$42 for 3 pieces) & had the head deep-fried.& we all loved the sous vide tako kari kari age.the sake was ex… S$50 & only 25% discount.& the golden prawns (basically teppanyaki large prawns with lots of mayo) was really good! each of us had about 5 prawns, so there must be 20 pieces. we took very little mayo but this mayo taste was very good. the lobster uniyaki today was below the usual standard. i had always liked the lobster but somehow this time the lobster meat did not have the usual bouncy fresh texture. couldn’t say it was bad but c/w the golden prawns, it was substantially poorer.& the kagoshima wagyu konabe was as good as ever.the bill came to S$239nett for 4pax (c/w S$205 for 4pax at chikuwatei & such huge guff in quality of food). excluding the sake, it would be S$195nett or S$165++ for 4pax, really good deal. i think i gonna go back just for the chirashi don. see my full reviews & photos at = http://chefquak.com/2014/06/25/so-very-nice-4pax-family-dinner-mikuni-on-23jun2014

If you loved Japanese food for its freshness and its flavour. You should give this restaurant a try! It has nice ambience and the food is simply ................... heavenly! We tried the omakase menu, and the chef choice for the evening were awesome... I miss the food there already..Of course, the quality comes with a price... the food was a little pricey, hence if there is promotion, you should grab it and try it for yourself
4
We were staying at the Fairmont so this was convenient. Lovely looking restaurant with different areas. We sat at the teppanyaki table, which was a little disappointing for us, as there was no interaction with the chef. For the prices it would have been nice - sounds silly but many other Japanese places have smaller areas so it feels more intimate - this is just a long crescent shaped bar with the cooking area at one end. The service was good - but my husband was really surprised that the saki they recommended was cold. We ordered separate items from the menu. I had soft shell crab in tempura batter and my husband had sashimi. Both were nice but the batter could have been lighter. We had the lobster for main - and I have to say the over abundance of sauce completely spoiled the lobster - far too heavy and should have been served on the side. The wagyu was delicious as was the mushroom dish. As with most Japanese restaurants all this comes at a price. The wine by the glass selection was also very limited. Some highlights but also some disappointments
3
We left ourselve in the hands of the waitress who offered only the food that we had seen on the website. We're a little disappointed...
5
This place is expensive but food is good and overall experience is wonderful. Worth every cent you pay! The atmosphere is upmarket and the food is superb!!
3
Nice but expensive.As we do not know Japanese cuisine some of dishes were strange to us.Very helpful but a bit slow stuff.Won`t go again but it was an experience
5
Sit around the teppanyaki table and enjoy watching the prowess of the chef. Garlic rice, wagyu beef, salmon, mushrooms were delectable. For appetizers, the sushi was exceptional!
Ambience is modern Japanese - stylish yet not overwhelming.
Service was impeccable!
4
Firstly, the decor and ambience take you to modern japan and you will feel relaxed and a valued guest. Secondly, order tap water or you'll be served an opened huge bottle of Evian - at your own expense. Thirdly, the food ... I was seated in the teppan yaki section and it was lovely. The portions here are HUGE so it's really meant for sharing. I wish I could've eaten more but I did my best! Wag you gyoza were wonderful. The lobster with golden sauce was a whole lobster! I was impressed but the golden sauce was a very egg yolks home made mayo and I could've done without it. I like a sauce but it was over the top - maybe serve it as a option? I ate every bit though but was so full I thought I'd explode! I also had the medley of mushrooms which was delicate and subtle but after the lobster I had to shovel it in. The rice, condiments and tea were all fabulous. Even the petit fours - well I just HAD to fit them in - were chocolates and other treats that all looked like river stones and sea grasses. Stunning! I waddled back to my room and had to loll about like a walrus but even the waiter brought me a digestive macha tea (in the restaurant, not in my room! ) LOL. Next time, I'd try a regular a la carte or set.... One person $136SGD without alcohol

This is the rather well known Japanese restaurant in Fairmont Hotel however, the entrance is at the shopping centre. Lighting is muted and a little dark. First impression was good although it did not have the typical Japanese feeling about it.The restaurant space is very large with different sections including a robatayaki room and a teppanyaki section. Everything is rather professional as in typical 5-star hotel standard should be. Pricing is way way up there however, I found the quality of the food rather average. We had the 7-course sashimi with very good quality (note: it was not excellent) which was served with semi-fresh (pre-packed) wasabi. For a restaurant of this level, I had expected a wasabi root to accompany the sashimi.We also ordered a grilled squid which came quicker than any MacDonalds! The downside was the lukewarm temperature albeit nicely done. We also ordered a prawn tempura and the batter was not crispy enough and one prawn in particular felt slightly mushy and not like fresh prawns should be.While the service was good on the whole, the whole atmosphere lacked the classic Japanese attention. Will I go again? Very likely not, as there are a few other really top notch Japanese restaurants in Singapore which I would pay a bit less without the hype.As a whole, the sashimi was good, the tempura was mediocre at best and is to be avoided. The restaurant lacks soul and character
5
The food here was utterly out of control, in the best possible way. Super-expensive (although Mondays, if you have an AmEx card, mean you get 50% off!) - try the set menu if you feel overwhelmed by choice. Scallops, sea urchin, sashimi, monkfish, passionfruit sorbet - there isn't a single thing I ate that was less than superb
5
Yes it was the most expensive meal we've had so far... But totally worth it. I wasn't expecting to have such a lovely meal in a mall, I am not a fan of malls, but you soon forget where you are. Everything about Mikuni was special, especially the food. We sat at the sushi bar and seemed to have our own personal waiter who just appeared magically whenever we wanted. The sushi chefs were friendly and professional and very good at their job.I can't think of anything negative to say about this place. It was pricey, but worth it
4
During our stay at Fairmont hotel, we came to notice this private and nicely designed Japanese restaurant.From the reception area, this restaurant looked hidden by the blinds at the entrance. But as we entered, we could see that they've got a very nice restaurant design with tables and teppanyaki bar. So we decided to give it a try as we were charmed by the exclusive luxury atmosphere it created.We didn't look at the price on the menu as we thought that it would be just like the normal luxury Japanese resto we've been to, so we just ordered what we wanted.The food tasted good. But nothing really "different" to our taste buds. So used to Japanese food, we thought that the taste was just normal. I ordered a la carte and he ordered the set menu .(1 appetizer, 1 main course, 1 dessert).When we finished all our food, we got complimentary desserts (additional one for him) which were very much appreciated.Just to our shock, when we got the bill, we had to pay three times extra than what we would usually pay in any other Japanese restaurants we visited! It was because at this resto, we had to pay for the +++ rate. (We didn't expect it as around the area there are many so-called "normal - rated" restaurants and even food courts).So, please expect to pay more for your food. Basically you should expect to pay for the fine dining experience and the unforgettably fabulous interior with dimmed blue light atmosphere. We would only come again if we have some special occasion to celebrate.

Beautiful ambience , good food . I had the wagyu don ... I thought it was very good even at $48for a bowl with 6 cubes of beef. It was excellent . The miso soup was good but ordinary. I liked the tofu dish and the teppanyaki mushroom dish. Worth a visit but be prepared topay .... It's not cheap 
4
As expected of high end Japanese restaurant, the food is fresh and of high quality. I particularly love the Kagaoshima beef whichever way it is cooked. The wait staff are always friendly and attentive. Don't much care for the decor.
4
The food was very good, the sashimi and sushi selections were very fresh.
Service was top notch and will return again for dinner.
5
Hands down best japanese meal I have ever had (also the most expensive but worth every singapore penny). Exquisitely prepared food and friendly , expert yet personal service in elegant surroundings. I went twice in four days :)
5
We walked in at lunch and was able to get a seat. The food's not cheap but the lunch bento, one of the cheapest items on the menu at SGD58+++ was brilliant. The food is fresh, light, creatively put together. And the service was attentive. I'd definitely recommend Mikuni. It's expensive for dinner but I thought the lunch was pretty good value
4
Having stayed at the Fairmont, we decided to give this a try due to the good reviews and it lived up to those. The food - fusion? - was fresh, especially the beef, and service was good. But it does make a huge hole in the wallet
2
My expectations were high of this place after reading the comments on Tripadvisor, though sadly my experience here did not live up to the expectations. The setting is nice and the food was very good, though the service was really lacking. Restaurant staff are not attentive and you really have to get someone's attention (at times there were five or six staff gathered in one corner of the restaurant, chatting.....). Also, when I arrived, there were two staff talking to a guest telling a guest they we fully booked, and left me waiting. Not sure why it took two people to perform this task. I was not impressed. Anyways, good food, but service needs a lot of work.
4
This wonderful eating outlet was recommended by my colleague. Reservation is required. (I realized all good eateries requires reservation) The ambience is good. The food is great, not your usual Japanese fare. It is what I will describe as "East meets West".Nothing is boring. The presentation of the food, the quality and the taste, all done to perfection. Even the dessert is uniquely Japanese pudding but with western berries.Sweetness tamed by the tangy berries. A wonderful gourmet experience even if its a wee bit harsh on my pocket. Be prepared to splurge between S$200 to S$250 for 2 persons. As far as I am concerned, worth your money
4
Mikuni serves great Japanese food of the good quality. Service was good. The Robatayaki was excellent. The Lunch sets are value for money. The wagyu ribeye was great at $100 for 200g. The sashimi and sushi were nothing fancy but delicious. The dessert was yummy. The complimentary matcha truffles and the redbean cakes were awesome. Prices on the menu is not cheap by Singapore standard. expect to splurge a little here
4
Had an enjoyable 5-course lunch just a few days ago. All ingredients arrived by plane just a few hours before (so lunch is fresher than dinner!). Was told that the Urchins & lobsters were moving & alive, the greens were all organic & handpicked by the esteemed chef. So exacting in his standards, he brought his own brewed Shoyu and herbal tea. Although the menu was good, this degustation menu was not one that will wow you. The entre of Crispy Ise Ebi Lobster was ok. But it was the Milk Pudding, 10 styles of grains, summer peach & blue berries that impressed me... I just wanted more. But the small portions was insufficient for both of us.Mikuni was the resurrected Inagiku. The restaurant is tastefully renovated. We sat at the counter of the very beautiful Robatayaki area. The staff was efficient, friendly and attentive. We were served v enthusiastically by a Korean waiter.At SGD 110+++ per head, this is inexpensive. Especially when we get to take photos and chat with a decorated & unassuming chef. But the need to photocopy & fax both sides of a credit card to reserve...to surrender the credit card details including the CVC is too much to stomach & reeks of ill-trust.However, will come back to Mikuni again... and will get the organic coffee then
5
This Japanese jewel in Singapore is outstanding! Exceptional head chef Mr Moon bring out the very best of what Japanese Cuisine can offer... Beautiful Japanese Manager who always welcome with Great Smiles, and with her impeccable knowledge of the cuisine... simply exceptional! The Chef at Robadayaki, Tommy is outstanding individual who bring his soul and knowledge to each and every dish he present to the guest! Great team of floor serving team, and remarkable standard of Japanese cuisine.. From Sushi Bar, to Tapenyaki and to Robadayaki even Sake bar will fulfil your Japanese dining needs without fail.Please ask for Tommy who will take care of you in impeccable manner
5
3 sets are offered here: Seafood, Beef, or Prawn & Beef. The golden prawn is still a favorite and food quality is high. The only thing I felt unfitting was the Pre-cooked fried rice and the chef just reheated it on the teppanyaki grill.
5
We had a Father's Day lunch and it was lovely.Considering we do none of the interesting sashimi cuts and top grade beef the bill was a bit hefty if I did not have the feed at raffles card.To be fair the sukiyaki was divine and worth its price tag . However the portion was fairly small so I had to order 2 portions for my 7 year old girl. My older boy ,hubby and I had the sets planned for Father's Day and it was quite worthwhile as we were happily filled and every dish was well done.The grilled meats were beautifully tender and well marinated without being too sweet. We could taste the freshness of the beef and chicken as they were delicately grilled and it was not oily.The wait staff were very attentive and made the whole dining experience very pleasant.I would return but would take recommended sets as they are good value. Maybe I will feel better if I have had uni or toro but 160 buck for the 2 sukiyaki for my little gal was a bit hard to swallow though it was really good as to start off she never liked beef and here she was requesting for a second order

See full reviews & photos in my blog=http://chefquak.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/dinner-mikuni-at-fairmont-hotel-on-24-3-2013/I go to Mikuni a lot as my wife & I really enjoy the food there, and with Feed@Raffles discounts (50% discount for 2pax), that is the best value eat we can get anywhere. We always order ala carte so we pick only dishes we like and also it is much better value than ordering the Seasons Menu or the Grand Tour Tasting Menu. We explore the menu quite a bit & zero in on the dishes we like. My selected courses (shared by 2pax) as follows-1. truffle kampachi (S$28) - a wonderful, wonderful dish, and as you can see in my blog picture, it is so pretty. It is in a small way a fusion sashimi dish by the Korean Chef with kampachi sashimi fanned out in probably tsuyu sauce as the sauce is not so salty, and a dash of truffle oil – so very fragrant, fresh, sweet & tasty! 2. botan ebi sashimi (S$35) – you get 3 prawns for sashimi & 2 if you order sushi. These are large (3x the size of regular ama ebi), plump & sweet prawns with the same pleasant slightly sticky to the bite texture as regular ama ebi; and they deep fry the large prawn heads. We eat up almost the entire crispy deep-fried prawn heads every time so no need to elaborate la…haha. 3. united nation futomaki (S$28) - The name sounds like a disaster but there are 9 ingredients (I can see there are unagi, ebi, tamago, avogado, different fish roes, maybe crabstick etc in my blog pictures) & it is good – may not be the best as there are many specialist maki in many restaurants these days, but it is good!4. tako (octopus) sous vide & deep-fried in light batter (S$30) - This is really very good as the meat is totally tender & consistent throughout because of sous vide (vacuum low temperature slow-cooking). it goes very well with just a little wasabi mayo (provided) – we always add more wasabi on our own.5. kagoshima wagyu sukiyaki konabe (小钵).(order 1 hotpot each at S$48pax) - It is very, very good! there are 3 pieces of wagyu, and you can see from the photos that they are large & thick pieces – I reckon the 3 pieces to be at least 80g, probably 100g! these are Jap wagyu NOT australian wagyu, & they are so, so tasty, the sukiyaki also comes with the usual vegetables, thick Japanese glass noodles & mushroom, and oh such great flavours! you can add the soup to the rice afterwards (and remember to add wasabi to it as well)

Had assorted sashimi, which were very tasty and generous portion. The Wagyu Beef served on a skewer was very tender and succulent. Desserts were good. Prices are "above average" from my perspective but I think it's worth the value.Restaurant ambience is cosy. very good service. Staff are knowledgeable and do make good recommendations of dishes

We thought we would be seated near an action station and get good food at reasonably high price. We were seated in a very dark restaurant with black walls and small spot lights. We asked to be moved and then were seated within view of a Tepanyaki station, which was ok, then 6 men on a business meal were seated so we couldnt see much. Drinks offer was 99SD for bottle of Verve Cliquot, excellent value by most standards. We had small portions of 6 dishes, sushi 4 pieces, sashimi 3 pieces, prawn tempura, teriyaki chicken, no crab, the bill was 300SD including tax and service. Not worth it. If you go, ask for a table by any of the bars (tepanyaki or robatyaki) and enjoy the chefs cooking techniques, otherwise go elsewhere

We ate Teppanyaki and choose the standard menu. We wanted to change some things in order to have it glutenfree which was not an issue. The Glutenfree diat was well respected and the staff was very knowledgable of what needed to happen to make it glutenfree.The quality of the food was excellent. Every single dish was presented and served with style. Ingredients were all fresh and topclass. We were truly impressed.Of course, this all has its price and it is easy to spend 300 SGD per person for a standard meal. Really expensive ! THough you get something in return. Also the environment is cosy and very pleasant. We will be back

We ordered a variety to share and found the general quality here pretty high. The sashimi platter, the makis, the teppanyaki courses, especially the fried rice and the steaks were done very very well. Service is prompt and the food is served very quickly. Price is a little on the high side but that is the case for good japanese food everywhere in SG these days

The cuisine may not be very creative, but the food here always uses top-quality ingredients, and it shows in the superb taste. Zen ambience. The service, however, is the weakest among the various components of a great restaurant. My lunch partner has soup spilled on him, without any offer of compensation or apologies from the management

I went there with my wife recently and surprisingly found that the restaurant has changed it's name and the entire decor as well. The new look was fantastic, it's a real zen place. Sure it's expensive so be prepared to splurge, we ate at the teppenyaki table, the chef was excellent and took special care as my wife has food allergies. The food was excellent including the sashimi. Everything was very fresh and the service was only to please us. Waiting for our next trip to Singapore to go and dine at the mikun

This is the second time that my friend took my to this restaurant and the second time that I enjoyed it and this time even the decoration is beautiful and very zen. We had the set menu for lunch which had a lot of very good plates. The Sashimis were very good and perfectly fresh (you can always tell by the Sea Urchin), The Miso Soup was great as was the service. Very good address, nothing to add ;-
