I really liked the place. I went there following online comments and I really enjoyed the english breakfast I had.
It offers an unique atmosphere in Singapore downtown. In the overall my experience there was perfect.

Busy but nice open atmosphere with choice of outdoor seating. Good for breakfast, enjoyed the Spanish baked eggs and chorizo

This cafe is located in the centre of the business district in Raffles Place. The staff looked after me while I waited for my daughter to finish work. I had an English breakfast tea and several Americano coffees. Coffee was a good flavour and strength. Had very good service. The savouries were also fresh and filling. There are less expensive cafes but the location is City Centre so you will pay a premium. Busy at lunch so may need to book.

I previously passed a chance to dine here with my wife because we saw few people inside. Wrong decision.But I finally got a chance to have brunch with friends today - and was pleasantly surprised.Three things I enjoyed most:- Food quality and menuWe ordered pancakes, muesli, and scrambled eggs with sour dough toast. But my fave meal was eggs benedict. It had smoked ham over toasted brioche with fresh spinach. Egg was perfectly poached, soft-boiled, and hollandaise sauce wasn’t overly sour. With 2 servings, it was quite heavy.- Warm serviceThe reception was quick to meet us at the door. The waiter was proactive and alert to arrange the tables and take the order.- Relaxed ambienceTruly relaxing atmosphere. High ceiling and nice casual layout that helps to project large space. No pressure to finish your meal. Plenty of time to share stories over breakfast and a cup of chai latte.The Providore deserves a couple more visits for me to try their other specialties.Delight

Great burgers and very good fruit juice/sodas/smoothies. Coffee is Aussie-style. Outside seating - one of the more cafe-like options around Raffles Place. Bit expensive, though ($85 for 2 x burgers and 2 x soft drinks), and service can be a little slow. Overall decent and would recommend

Extremely disappointing. Ordered an English breakfast requested to replace mushrooms with spinach, got a flat No. We asked again to check with the chef if it can be replaced, got a rude reply “ I know the chef for two years he wont change”. Replacement of a serving is always accepted. I have never seen such rigidity. Staff in general seems rude early in morning for a not so busy start of the day. We would highly recommend staying away from this place if you like to mix and match your food and cannot stand rudeness that comes free with no service at all. We definitely are not coming back to a restaurant that can be so rigid

Came across Providore quite by accident and very glad we found this small cafe. It's situated in Raffles Place near the MRT station. We were greeted with a smile and found all the staff very friendly and professional. The coffee was exceptional...certainly some of the best I've had in Singapore. Combined with a delicious scone it make for a very satisfactory coffee break. My partner really enjoyed the very berry smoothie and a raspberry and dark chocolate mousse. Prices were very reasonable and on a future visit, we may well be tempted by one of the meals available. Highly recommended

this little 'island' cafe is rather beautiful - love the decor - external and internal. came in the evening for a drink. located next to the Raffles Place MRT station, it's a convenient place to get a drink, or a meal. we were greeted and shown to a table of our choice. we did not want to be seated in between 2 tables. it was evening time, and it was half full which was fine. i would come back for a meal perhaps, given that the menu seem rather interesting and the service was not too bad

I just bought one of Providore's cheese and ham ploughman baguette to take away.How disappointing, a small piece of cheddar cheese that ran less than half the length of the baguette, and hardly any pickle relish, which meant that it was incredibly dry and unable to be eaten unless you have a drink at the same time. My advice - turn around and head 20m to Paul's and buy one of theirs instead

The Providore is in its now stand alone building in Raffles Place. Just a few 100yards from the MRT exit. It' is a very popular cafe/bar meeting place for the local offices close by so tends to be very busy throughout the day. The coffee is of a good standard. bar snacks, pastries and cakes are of a good quality. The breakfast and lunch menu choice is good and presented well. There is an outside area with adequate AC. Staff are very friendly and helpful however sometimes they do appear a little rushed off thier feet due to the place being popular...

It is not easy to find delicious cakes in Singapore but you can find it there. Coffee is a bit strong but taste good. There is good for chatting and hang out. I usually spent afternoon time there.

Nice place to sit outside on the terrace hand have a good cake and coffee
The sparkling water and house Wine is also best Quality and therefore fair priced. Staff is fast and we like to come regularly for a cup of coffee.

The service is usually excellent & the location convenient.
Their food, drink & products are generally very good.
The only negative is that it's far more expensive than other cafes so you're paying more for the brand.

The Providore sits in its own building at one end of Raffles Place. Very popular with the legal and accounting types. They have a good menu for any time of day and their coffee is world standard. It can get very busy so you may need to wait for a table at busy times. Has both indoor and outdoor seating so depending on your level of sweat yoy may get an outside spot more easily.

Nice place for a coffee, or a beer! A bit uncomfortable noisy for not too casual business meeting. Industrial decoration in the trendy way. Attentive service. Regular coffee starts at sg$5. That one was sg$6.5, very well executed cappuccino. All plus 10%+7%. The bottled beer section of the menu is interesting, and relatively well priced. Very busy place on a Friday morning and every other times I passed by.

On our walk through the city we stopped for a light lunch, we had club sandwiches, really good bread and well served with avocado. The next day we went back again, we tried the steak sandwich and that was delicious as well! A bit noisy when filled up with people, but a very nice place. I recommend it, fun and lively.

Generally ok, except for the interior acoustics which make it almost impossible to have a working lunch or coffee inside. Food is generally ok, if a bit pricey. Recently, however, I've noticed the quality of their pastries and takeaway items declining. This morning I purchased a breakfast sandwich only to find that it had already gone bad. If the kitchen can't maintain good quality control for a ham and cheese, I'd hate to think how it's doing for the more complicated stuff. Best be careful before taking big bites

This place is less crowded on weekend but as the place is within a small area, the seating is not plentiful and one is still advised to book before going on weekend. The providore has glass windows and good natural lighting. The menu is average but the food is good. In addition there are display shelves selling coffee or chocolate powder/grounds/pods. This makes the experience of shopping for birthday or Christmas gifts for coffee lovers quite interesting. The staff are prompt in service and all is comfortable for 4 friends to mingle. The chocolate drink has 4-5 types itself and the cakes on display looks really tempting too.

I had read great reviews on this establishment and decided to give it a try with my hubby on our day off.We are disappointed as the cakes looks good but does not taste good. We tried their moscato Apple cheesecake ...Price is also on the steeper side compared to nearby cafe. Coffee is ok but nothing "wow". Location is good though as it is easily accessible from Raffles Place MR

First, let me start with the delicious coffee. Next top it off with breakfast or lunch plate and last but not least, a great location for business meetings. Whe the place fills up the acustics can be challenging but still a great place for meetings, quick breakfast or lunch. Highly recommended
