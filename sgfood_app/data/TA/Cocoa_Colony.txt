The chocolate sorbet is so amazing! You need to love rich chocolate as this is quite dark but still sweet. It is so creamy and delicious.

Stopped here for some iced tea after lunch at Tsuta opposite. There aren't many seats so we were fortunate to grab 2. I had the chai latte which was perfectly adequate. Seems to be mainly geared to take-away.

More for takeaways as this place only has 4 seats at a counter. Lots of non-coffee beverages for such a tiny place, but the Lychee Iced Tea is too sweet, and the Virgin Mojito is not very minty limey. Friendly service.

The chocolate bread turkey cheese sandwich is really good! Same goes for the Maltese milkshake!! üëçüèª skip the waffles though, overrated!

This place is great for chocolate lovers from the drinks to the cakes to the muffins and to the waffle... my most favourite is the dark chocolate drink but it is still very sweet for me.. :)

The coffee the cakes the sandwiches - everything is just wow. Loved the taste. The portions are good for one. Good to go when you want to pick up a quick bite, or also when you want to spend time relishing the flavorful coffee aromas. PS: some excellent merchandise available too!

We went there for a quick outing with the family and realized that all 7 tables were full. This is a good sign if people were moving fast. All the tables had people sitting there well beyond them having finished their drinks. The staff told us that they cannot ask the patrons to leave even if there are other customers with new orders wanting to sit there. Wonder if this is a viable business model? The place had a lot of students and wonder if there is any responsibility and is it fair for students to be doing that when u have few tables.The staff however were very good and we ordered 4 drinks and one of which was not what we expected this to be and they actually changed it for us

I bought the groupon voucher for cocoa colonyTried the chocolate shakerato..very chocolatey..but a but small for the price..the crab and prawn croissant was very yummy.small but filled with fresh ingredients eg cherry tomatoes and arrowhead vegetables. The marshmallow coated with chocolate was very tempting.however i think it will be more suitable to serve in a cup rather let it lie on a plate

I was there with my family on a weekday afternoon. We ordered the coffee and ice cream and they were all excellent ! The decor is simple but attractive with ample tables and chairs around. It was a nice hangout place for a weekday afternoon. I would recommend it to friends or families who are out for a caffeine or sweet fix

The cocoa shakerato ($7) is extremely chocolatey and rich. And the hazelnut cocoa ($7) is bursting with the nutty taste! In fact I felt as though I was drinking liquid Ferrero Rocher. I went to the outlet at suntec city, at a quiet corner of the mall (#02-737). Very much recommended.
