The place is great and the staff are attentive. A pity that our mains were served warm instead of being hot, but being a bar I guess they're better at their bar grubs instead of their mains as their truffle fries were great!

Had the Duck Comfit. GREAT taste and portion just right for an enjoyable lunch. Lorraine's attentiveness was excellent as always. Looking forward to the new lunch menu.

We went to Bodacious after seeing the restaurant on TV. A very cosy place for dinner. Great service and good value food. Will be back for the oyster (miss it last week).

It was great to find the place so lively even so late on a weeknight. The staff were prompt with the service. Food was above average, especially the tuna tartare. I think a live band would have spiced up the evening a bit. But overall a nice place to just chill with friends

This place is one of those normal cafes inside Biopolis. I wouldn't drive all the way here just to eat the food but if you happen to be in the neighborhood, then this place is great. We came here for the set lunch. Regretted ordering the salmon rillette which wasnt very interesting. Sea bass was okay

Lunch specials here are first class. I had a scallops and prawn pesto dish that was genuinely superb. Scallops can be a challenge. They have to be fresh and they have to be cooked delicately and to perfection to be at their peak. And perfect they were. Fresh hot and delicious right from the kitchen to the open patio dining area (air conditioned inside service also available). My two friends both had steaks and were equally impressed. We all had salad appetizers and the greens were fresh, sweet and crisp. Prices were very reasonable and service was excellent
