The first sip and I am wowed. Although the laksa is different from those we got from Penang, Kuching or Borneo, it has a distinct soothing taste that is pleasant and inviting. I recommend all to take a try.

Over the years I have been a little skeptical of Laksa as something I would enjoy to eat- I think mainly because it needs to be done very well to be good. This place does it very well and is a great advert for the dish. Order on a touch screen and ready in 5-10 mins. I ordered the regular laksa and the fish paste. Tasty, filling and with a fabulous balance of spice and coconut. One for lunch or a gathering of friends informally- not special occasions.

We were searching for an authentic Laksa for our overseas guest, and remembered that this dedicated Laksa stall in a coffee shop in Holland Village did serve good Laksa many years ago. We went to the shop which is located opposite Parisilk. It is now better organised and putting technology to good use. We placed our order through an iPad. A bowl of Laksa now costs $5 and it did not disappoint! It was everything we remembered it to be - tasty, flavourful, rich, exotic, with a rich and well balanced soup. The ingredients were fresh and the cockles and Seafood were enough for a satisfactory meal. What a delight to enjoy such high standards maintained through the years! We observed that the other customers, both young and old, were clearly equally passionate about this dish.

I used to like to go to this place when I want to have a good bowl of larsa. Back then the larsa here was creamy. The ingredients like fish cake, prawns, cockles were fresh and tasty. The noodles were cut to small size so that you can eat it with spoon. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. I came here yesterday to fulfil my larsa craze. The noodles were long like spaghetti, you have to eat with chop sticks and the soup is very diluted. Ingredients are miserable and not fresh. No idea what happened to this place. Totally disappointed. Not going back anymore. By the way there's a Hong Kong pastry shop few unit away and it's always crowded, must be quite good. Will go there next time

One of the worse laksa and nasi lemak I've ever had! As tasteless as frozen TV dinners! This is the tourist version of local delicacies. Waiting 12 mins for a bowl of laksa and nasi lemak that normally takes 2 - 3 mins at any other hawker stall is ridiculous and both dishes were barely warm.Watery, thin laksa soup, nasi that had little or not fragrance. Sweet, spice-less, lemak chili sauce, bland and oily, lukewarm chicken wing. Fancy iPad menu withou hot drinks and just another way to increase prices without doing anything for the food or service, there's not hot drinks even.Overpriced, bland food, slow service, this place is to be avoided like a plague! You'll find better/cheaper nasi lemak and laksa at the nearby Holland Drive hawker center

chanced upon this place yesterday at lunch time. love the way to order - not having to wait for some one to come take your order is quite fun. the prices are reasonable. we had the laska which was nicely done - good seasoning for the gravy - you can add your own amount of chilli, 2 big prawns - shelled in the middle (so considerate) and slices of fish cake, cockles and bean sprouts. the canned drinks were not too expensive like other places. overall, very clean place and not at all noisy. if i'm in the neighbour, i would return to try the other dishes

Laksa here is average at best.Cockles were small but not ridiculously tiny like at some other stalls.Will I crave for this laksa? No.Will I come all the way just to eat this laksa? No.Will I dream about this laksa? No.Is this laksa edible? Yes

I found this place on a Singapore food blog and thought that while in the city for business I'd call in and try a place so highly recommended for the hawker centre classic I've grown to love best, Laksa. I wasn't disappointed. 363 Katong Laksa is a no fuss kind of place; you place your order using a tablet installed at the entrance to the restaurant and grab your meal when your little "alarm-disc-thing" goes off. The tablet ordering experience let me easily customise exactly what I wanted in my laksa and tempted me into throwing in a few extras! When the meal came it was delicious, with a really rich gravy. Came to about $5 SGD (USD $3.65) plus a drinks. Can't beat it when you're looking for a quick, cost-effective bite to eat

This place specializes on 2 dishes: laksa and nasi lemak, both at hawker prices around $5. They have several tablets installed outside and you just order by selecting what you want on their app, which makes it super quick easy to customize each order: add extra prawn, skip the bean curd etc to get your laksa (or nasi lemak) exactly how you want it. I usually come here for laksa (its really delicious), but I tried Nasi Lemak couple of times and it was pretty good too

This place is located at Holland Village. I found out about this place from blogs as it is listed as one of the best in Singapore for Laksa.The ordering system is efficient where you have four i-pads at the front of the shop for you to choose what you want to eat and drink. Extras for any particular ingredients and it's related extra costs have been laid out clearly.I had the most basic Katong Laksa without any extras. It is at an affordable SGD 4 per dish. It is not a big portion but enough for a light afternoon lunch.The laksa is not too spicy and nice enough to savour the tastes and ingredients that comes with it.Place is clean and staffs are reasonably friendly. Try it out while you're at Holland Village

The Laksa soup from this outlet is authentic Singapore style. Taste is good, environment is clean but service is mediocre. Ê≠£ÂÆóÊñ∞Âä†Âù°Âä†‰∏úÂèªÊ≤ôÊ±§Ôºå Â•ΩÂêÉÔºÅÂπ≤ÂáÄÁéØÂ¢É‰ΩÜÊúçÂä°‰∏ÄËà¨„ÄÇ

The restaurant is a modern fusion, with an electronic automated ordering system. I had a lakhsa and it was excellent, spicy and tasteful. üëçüëç

Decent nasi lemak and katong laksa at average price. It serves as a good alternatives to the cafes in Holland V. They have upgraded where you now order your food/drinks via Ipad.

While not as famous at the Michelin-rated 328 Katong Laksa, the laksa here is tasty, nasi lemak and otak too, and definitely tastier than most! Order taking and queues are automated, so I would not encourage my parents whom are in their 70s to come on their own. Die-die must try if you are around Holland Village

The title says it all. Absolutely delicious. You order at an iPad at the front of the store where you can customize your bowl, then you get a buzzer and collect your food when it's done. The lime juice was delicious! And the Laksa itself was flavoursome and delicious. Lots of fish cake, prawns and stuff inside. I opted for no cockles. All around, great laksa.The otah was terrible. Rubbery, flavorless and barely any chili. Not worth it

I am going here in a search for Laksa that I used to try back several years ago. I do not know whether it is the one or not, because finally this is the only one selling Laksa around the neighborhood.The good thing here is you have to order via ipad where you can customize your topping for your Laksa or Nasi Lemak. Such as prawn, fishcake etc. So you have pretty much free time to customize what you want.The taste of the food was just average. The prawn loses it taste. I believe it was frozen prawn, not the fresh one. The soup did not habe any taste of seafood at all.The price is fair S$4.00 for the basic Laksa. However I added more prawn and fishcake that cost me additional S$2.00. You better bring your own drink since the drink cost more expensive than in the minimarket or street seller.Overall, I wouldn't recomend people to ride far enough from downtown to here just for the Laksa. Anyhow, if you already around the neighborhood and would like to try it, it's OK

After visiting an old friend, we decided to give the old place a visit again. The first thing that surprised me was it has gone Tech. Press a few buttons and your food is ordered. And personally, that was the only good thing in this place. The soup was really milky, and lacked the punch, I was looking forward too. I tried adding more chilly, but, no can do. Looks like, I might have to travel to Katong to get my fix! Sad really.Naturally, the cost went up by about 10%

Our favourite singapore laksa place. we dun really like the famous katong laksa in east coast, 363 is our fave in town. the soup is so creamy and smooth. the aroma and everything is just right! we always bring our visitors to 363 for laksa. :

I really love this place. Menu is limited but the taste won't disappoint you, especially the katong laksa. Order your food with an ipad, and top up the things that you want more i.e extra cockles, chili, number of chicken etc. Service is fast. Price is reasonable

This place has recently invested in touch screen order system where patrons have to key in their own orders , The kitchen despatches the food swiftly.Try the nasi lemak with chicken wing and add on the otah. Egg slice is rather little. You can add one more portion of egg
