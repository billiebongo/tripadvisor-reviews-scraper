I went to their outlet at Plaza Singapura (basement 2). They have a stall selling fried and grilled seafood, mainly squid in a sort of Japanese style.I tried the Japanese style spicy crab (deep fried without the top shell and claws) and some Grilled squid. They have Deep fried large crispy squid and Grilled squid, both on wooden skewers, fried or grilled, basted and spiced, then cut up and served.I picked the Grilled squid with the Obasan fiery sauce for basting and asked them to hand it to me whole on the skewer instead of cut up. Nice.They have 3 outlets, Vivocity, Bugis Junction and Plaza Singapura

Very nice Fried Squid. I ordered the Large Fried squid with hot and Spicy Flavor and it was delicious! It was freshly cooked when you ordered and even when I got home to eat it, it was still so crispy on the outside and juicy tender squid in the inside. Even though it was deep Fried, it didn't taste oily either. They have many other flavors to try and also serve grilled squid and some other snacks and drinks. Good eats
