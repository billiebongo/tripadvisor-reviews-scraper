Worst food I have ever tasted in my life. Staff where extremely rude and racist. While I was ordering my food the lady serving me was very rude and was talking to the other waitress while my food was being served. The food was served cold and I had my eyes rolled at when I asked for it to be warmed up. They do not speak english at this place or treat people with respect.

This outlet opens 24hours. For dinner or supper, they serve fantastic local and authentic pork rib soup! Don't miss out their wide varieties of seafood such as chilli crab and sambal squid!For breakfast you can get local traditional "socks" coffee with toasted bread and half-boiled eggs. They too serve wide range of beers and ciders! My personal favorite beer there will be Erdinger,while my partner loves her strongbow cider. I love this place as well as their friendly staff!
