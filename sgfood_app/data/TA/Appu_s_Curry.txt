We stopped by for lunch in this local authentic restaurant. Chicken tikka was tender and well grilled, set meal (tali) was rich with great flavors. Fresh baked "nan" and "paratha" (Indian breads) were delicious. Good service, quite cheap prices. We really enjoyed. Highly recommend (!)

Food: Briyani tasted average and spices were not prepared from scratched as I could taste the readily made spices which will not bring out the best tastes for most dishes.
Ambience: clean and comfortable to sit in.
Services: good services as serving time was prompt.

We dropped in here almost by accident, and were delighted with what we found. The food selection was excellent Indian dishes of both veg and non-veg. The ambience was also excellent - can recommend this place if you are looking to try Indian food, and yes, Indian food is spicy, but that's true Indian food

We walked past this Restaurant in Little India, it looked very clean and inviting so gave it a try. Now, this was our very first try at Indian Food, so when seated- studied the menu for quite some time,, The friendly waiter did speak some english, we choose some mixed dishes with vegetables and meats, with Naan breads. Altogether it was a nice meal, but just a little bit spicy for us. We were glad some yoghurt was included, and Yes, we did drink lots of cold water supplied. We found it an interesting experience and will try some more Indian food next time
