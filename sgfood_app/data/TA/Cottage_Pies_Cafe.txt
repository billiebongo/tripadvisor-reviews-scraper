Awesome pies! BLACKPEPPER pie is my favourite! A must try! A small place hidden, it near the taxi stand..

Very humble and unassuming little store. Have been frequenting them for nearly a decade now and amazed that their quality has never deteriorated one bit. Their chicken meat in the pie is extremely juicy and tender, unlike usual pies where chicken breast are usually used. Theirs are shredded chicken and marinated so well. Pastry is extremely crusty and light. I usually buy quite a bit and keep for the next morningâ€™s breakfast and it tastes just as good. They were also the originators of the Jelly Hearts before all the others jumped on the bandwagon. Very humble and friendly little family business. Will keep supporting them.
