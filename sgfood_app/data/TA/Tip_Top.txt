Bought a curry puff from the outlet at Raffles Place. It comes with egg and tasted really nice. Reasonably priced too.

Grab and Go cheap eats.
Standard local fare for those in a rush, such as beehoon and cheese tofu.
Curry puffs were alright (warm and crispy)

If you need to take a small bite try out the variety of snacks available. Apart from the signature curry puff and common sardines puff, this is so far the only place that I found that serves beef rendang puff too.The service at Raffles Place outlet is excellent. Upon realising the wrong puff was given after I have taken a bite, the staff immediately exchanged and passed me the right one
