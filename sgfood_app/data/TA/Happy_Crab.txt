We enjoyed the best Nasi Lemak breakfast of our 10 day trip at this unassuming corner restaurant. Soft freshly boiled rice. Crisp and fresh chicken. Delicious ikan bilis. A delight.

I have patronised Happy Crab many times. So far, the BBQ crab and the cuttlefish which I have tasted is one of the best. The crabs and cuttlefish are very fresh and very tender and juicy. For crab lovers, you will surely love it. However, the price of a small crab which cost about $40-$45 is a bit expensive and the coffee shop is without air-con.

Happy Crab is a bit complicated because it shares space with an Indian restaurant. While the Indian place is open all day, The Happy Crab corner becomes only active in the evening. I walked past three times until I finally asked and got the explanation. Anyway, it was worth the effort. I made a reservation in the late afternoon and was greeted with cheer by the Chinese gentlemen owners when I returned in the evening. The crab preparation is quite different from the common chili or pepper style. The taste of the barbecued crab is much more subtle and delicious. Hard manual work as expected.The sambal fried rice was great as a contrasting side dish and had a very generous amount of seafood added. Forget the greens.Will definitely come again with friends

Happy Crab Restaurant located at 13 Pahang St, Singapore this is an old-world little seafood shop combined with Indian food in an old corner coffeehouse. This is my first time to this place and the last. I seriously believe that I could have gotten a better occurrence in this restaurant, judging from reviews. The place was already crowded when I arrived at 7 pm on a Monday night, been on my own I decided to give it a go, the food that I ordered , it was awful. I should have known better the place is mainly for tourists. Also thumbs down for the staff they seem that they attending a funeral, No one smiled, little let alone them very rude, I felt invulnerable throughout. To sum up in few words, my dining experience ranks one of the worst dining experience in Singapore .Most of the food we ordered was absolutely tasteless, honestly to me, Hawker Centre food tastes much better

Yes, it look like a typical coffeshop Singapore style. but it is this coffeeshop where u will find great grilled crabs. bought a couple of guests who all enjoyed crab eating finger style. go early so you can enjoy a complimentary Durian dessert at the end of your meal

We went here in March 2017 while looking for an indian curry. We were a bit put off by the canteen style restaurant but we should have known not to judge it on this, the curry was one of the best we have ever had! So delicious and good value for money we thought

Grilled Squid (Sotong), Grilled/Charbolied Crab, Sambal Fried Rice and Fried Fish are incredibly yummy and the best!! It is located in one of the local coffee shops also known as Kopi Tiam. We visited Singapore during one of the hottest time of the year!! The humidity and scorching heat in August were almost unbearable but we continued our feasting lolWe could taste the sweetness and freshness of the crab! It was an expensive meal as the crab was pricey however it was worth every penny

A very casual eatery, which is run by 2 operators. In the day it sells Muslim -Indian food. "Happy crab" only serves dinner, starting at 6.30pm. Crabs are their speciality. They are fresh and meaty, done in anyway you like. But au natural is best as the freshness & sweetness of the crab meat really comes through. Other dishes e.g. Baby clams, seafood noodles and vegetables are also fresh and well done. It is not fine dining; but the service staff are friendly & helpful. Prices are reasonable.

The last time I had Ang's bbq crabs was many years ago at his Alexandra stall. Right now, a friend reconnected us to his current location. What a wonderful evening with crab that has over flowing roe. Ordered three crabs, bbq squid, vegetables, fish and the excellent beehoon. Oldies music brought back the nostalgia but really it was the great food at reasonable prices together with Ang and his partners that made the evening. Will be back here in no time.

Friends wanted to have crabs for dinner. Googled around and saw this place. Called them for reservation around noontime for that evening's dinner. The barbecued crabs were fresh and full of roe. Not much seasonings, just a little salt perhaps, brought out the freshness of the crabs, at its best, without being overwhelmed by the flavor of sauces. Also ordered sambal fried rice, clams and fried fish. We had a satisfying dinner

Finally there's a place serve barbecue crab in Singapore! Fresh barbecue style fat crabs! Lot of meats, lot of eggs. Sambal and wasabi mixture of sauce. Even all of the legs of the crab are contented.Two other dishes we ordered are clam in soup with alcohol, and salmon fish head with wasabi, soy sauce and Sambal at the side. Salmon head is yummy with the sauces, very unique although it might taste like you are eating salmon with wasabi in any of the Japanese restaurant, but it just still awesome, full of jelly and omega 3 fats.Finally clams taste a bit too plain for me. Clam meats are little too. I will try squid next time instead.Last bit, there is an ex-stewardess attendant named Georgia, a humorous, friendly and beautiful lady! She is one of the reason of this good experience eating here to me!

Eateries from the humble tzechar stalls to the fine dining restaurants in Singapore offer the standard crab dishes like pepper crab, chili crab and salted egg-yolk crab. Happy Crab's grilled crabs look simple and clean, but the taste and aroma is exceptionally sweet and fresh. The garlic prawns and grilled squid were similarly impressive. Fried rice and fried horfun had the right 'wok hei' and were delicious. Two other vegetable dishes completed a happy dining experience. Although located in a small corner coffeeshop in the arty Aliwal area, the operators cum servers were extremely warm, friendly and delightful

After being introduced to the team of Happy Crab, I have been regularly bringing visitors from overseas to dine here. It beats the overly popular seafood joints which are hard to get a reservation at and the food is great! Done by a team that enjoys spreading laughter and seeing happy faces over a messy table of crab shell
