Never know nitrogen can be used to make ice-cream till I tried this one. Their specialty is the coconut ice-cream with chocolate lava cake on top. Imagine putting a mouthful of freezing cold ice-cream with warm oozing chocolate cake onto your tastebuds. Superb!
5
100% recommended. Belgian Dark Chocolate and Salted Caramel ice cream. Made fresh in front of you and tastes amazing. Can you bring to England?
Great to finish off our last few hours in Singapore
5
We were walking and noticed this amazing icecream shop and said we would give a try. Turned out one of the best icecream shops ever. We promised ourseleves to come back again before travelling
4
Delicious and unique ice cream at One KM mall. Ice cream used gas to make. Their speciality is the coconut ice cream which tastes very good
4
The ice cream is nice. The lychee ice cream is not too sweet. Tastes just right. The price is on the high side though.
5
I was at the newly opened outlet at Jalan Batu. This was before lunch-time. The place was cosy and comfortably set up. The Hazelnut ice-cream with chocolate sauce served with waffles was an excellent choice for an after-breakfast dessert. The waffles was crispy without being burnt. Good job, Aileen. She is attentive to customer needs and has good interaction skills. She is also able to make recommendations
4
This is my first time to try the nitro ice cream, wondering if it would be any different and..IT IS! The taste well...it depends on which flavor you choose but what surprised me is its texture! A bit hard to describe..it's somewhere between icy and creamy, perfectly blended but not too thick. Kinda nice to have it after a meal. Doesn't make you too full. :) Have a try! The store location is pretty easy to find too, outside the Clark Quay Mall (if that's the name ;D). Hope you'd like it
5
I loved the nitrogen ice cream here. Had the coconut it was so creamy and good. It came with a lava cake which was ok but I like the ice cream on its own. I had another round of another flavor the same day but not as nice as the coconut. I think you can't go wrong with the premium flavours
4
Another good visit and this time we tried another new flavour - mango. They do it quite well... And thats what keeps this place interesting and keeps us coming back Suggested a couple of new Flavours , let's see if we get them in future visits !!
4
Very good ice cream. I ended up choosing peanut butter flavour but would have been nice to have some more flexibility or options. I just wanted to add Nutella either in the ice cream or on top but was told only 1 flavour and can't add Nutella??Didn't know it was too hard to charge me $1 and put Nutella on top.Anyway it is good ice cream and that's just me whinging
4
Best coconut ice cream I've ever tasted in Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Australia ...
It's a treat to watch them make your ice cream. Your patience is rewarded
5
Three of us had ice cream treats, my wife had their signature Thai coconut and loved it, my daughter had pink guava and it was tasty, and I had butterscotch which was divine. Nice little seating area next to store.
5
Initially sceptical, but the coconut ice-cream won me over.
Went well with the freshly-made waffle.
Frozen pints available for further take-home indulgence.
4
We are from the Netherlands and here on holiday our niece told us that we should try the signature "Coconut" icecream.
We loved it , beautiful flavor and a lovely texture.
I recommend this to everyone.
4
Salted caramel seems to have become he family favorite though I still like the fruit flavor especially pink guava. After 4-5 visits and one food panda delivery from the place, now I wish they would innovate a bit with the flavors and they seem to be doing that ( I saw some videos of cempedak! - unusual for my taste but good to know) Worth a visit
5
Visited 320 Below Ice Cream Parlour. The special about this shop is that they made the ice cream on the spot, in the view of the consumers.Consumers got to enjoy the instant freshness of the hand made ice cream. Friendly informative staff recommended the flavours and guided the consumer through ice cream making process. Their signature ice cream is Thai Coconut flavour. Ice cream range from $5 - $7, depending on the flavours.Witnessed the process. Ate the production. Enjoyed completely.
4
This was my 1st visit and my wife's second - and now we have together tried 8 flavors - the place scores full marks on the fresh flavors (coconut and pink guava). The regular chocolate types though could do a bit better ... Well worth a visit
4
Very cool ice cream that is made directly in front of you. It has a different texture to normal ice cream as it is smoother and creamier. The best flavours are the salted caramel and the coconut. Especially if you are a student you can receive a discount at certain times of the day which make it even more enjoyable
4
We tried one flavor today- apple cinnamon. As far as I could tell - no artificial flavors or colors; there were bits of Apple pieces which was great. The lady poured cream in a steel bowl and whipped it over liquid nitrogen (also cool to see). Tasted great though personally I would have liked some more cinnamon flavor. Overall a great experience, happy with the result, will try more flavors next time
5
We walked through the mall and randomly found this place. We tried the coconut ice cream and were very impressed! It's delicious and prepared fresh when you order. The liquid nitrogen process means the ice cream stays frozen no matter how slow you want to eat your dessert. The coconut ice cream is indeed low sugar and tastes exactly like a fresh young coconut
5
My honey-ginger ice cream started out simply as cream blended with ginger… I watched them blast it with liquid nitrogen, and it became AMAZING ice cream before my eyes!
Upon my first bite, I was hooked. I will be taking friends back with me!
5
This place is extremely cool - literally! Great selection of flavours, well priced too. Enjoyed watching our ice cream being made. Located inside the mall on ground floor towards the back. Definitely a must for dessert whilst in Singapore.
5
Excellent service and yummy ice cream, made to order fresh ice cream, love the coconut flavour, will definitely visit there again. Highly recommended!
4
This ice-cream cafe came recommended to me by a friend who raved about the coconut ice-cream when she didn't even like coconut. When I dropped by the cafe, I decided to try mixing the coconut and Horlicks. It was quite a good combination, although you taste the coconut a lot more than the Horlicks. I'd actually recommend just ordering the coconut on its own, as it tasted so fresh and natural. Will be back to try the other items
4
If you love icecream, you have to visit this place, if you love surprising effects efven more!The Icecream is made fresh with Nitrogen (see the Name) and tastes great - but the process of is as much fan as eating the icecream! The flavor in form of a Sirup is filled in a can, mixed and the Nitrogen is added - a steamy surprise! Try it, you will love it
4
Had the waffle with 2 scoops. The Thai coconut and salted caramel.They were made to order so a small wait that you can live with. The Thai coconut had nice pulp bits to it but the salted caramel was a slight bit of a let down. The waffle tasted generic with a generous dose of maple syrup. Be careful to check your receipt as we were overcharged! For the rest... Loved the whole experience
4
Super fresh ice-cream! We ordered the Peanut Butter (wasn't very sweet), the Nutella (just the right amount of sweetness and great taste!) and Salted Caramel (way too sweet, I couldn't finish it!) with a Butterscotch Blondie (also a bit sweet, but could also be because of the pairing!) Great ambiance, great service, friendly staff and free balloons, though can be a little pricey (then again, what ice-cream place isn't pricey?)Overall great place! Would definitely go again

This is the 5th time that I have patronized this outlet at Tampines Central 1 #B1-32, Tampines 1.It is also the first time that I have tried ice cream and yoghurt made with liquid nitrogen.It is fresh, made right in front of you. The most you have to wait is about five minutes for your order. Thanks for the quick freeze process that also gives a smooth texture product.Their signature flavours are the apple cinnamon, banana, lemon,lychee, mango, pink guava, strawberry, toffee, vanilla, peanut butter, salted caramel and so on ....You could pick your choice and mixed the flavours together. Your choice, your taste!They also served lava cake, classic brownie, butterscotch blonde, waffles; all topped wth ice cream.Their latest unique flavours like Thai coconut, raspberry, dark chocolate.After a hard day at work, just relax yourself at 320 Below. Although their outlet is not very spaceous, at the right time, you could still get a seat. The crews are pretty friendly too. After enjoying, kindly cleared your cups at the bin provided. Just enjoy!12/01/201

Visited 320 Below new outlet at Geylang Road as I was craving for their Thai Coconut ice cream. Got a chance to also try their newly launch JD cherry Vanilla (bourbon), both flavors were very delicious, especially the coconut ice cream which reminds me of the Thai coconut ice cream eaten at Cha Tuk Chak market in Bangkok. If you guys are craving for ice cream go check them up
5
With exotic and varying flavors, this place will entertain and satisfy the sweet tooth.If the ice cream isn't enough, there is lava cake and brownies to put you over the top.Unique concept that uses liquid nitrogen to produce , almost instant ice cream.Wouldn't mind going through the whole list
1
I can't find anything special about the ice cream, and its expensive! Been reading many good reviews about this, but either i ordered the ice cream that doesn't suit my taste or it was really aweful. We should have went to awfully chocolate instead
5
Had a lovely time here. Loved the bailey's chocolate. They even had cool water for free if the sweetness gets too much. Totally worth the money, esp when you get to see the ice-cream making. Clean & quiet little place.
5
I had to go here just to see how they make the ice-cream using liquid nitrogen. Very interesting. Quiet & relaxing ambience. & they had quite the variety. Would be going again soon, whn i feel adventurous enough to try other flavors.
4
If you are looking for primitive sugar-drenched flavours, this place is not for you. This is a place that takes an ingredient and turns it into a delicate icecream with respect and sincerity. Also, the tea is top-noch.
5
I accidentally discovered the place. The ice cream is smooth,rich, and yummy and have various choice of flavors. It's a must try. Open until 11 p.m. in case you are craving for something sweet and cold late at night :-)
5
This was a very unique experience. The ice cream is made right in front of you and tasted great!!! It was very fresh! Cool us all down on a hot Singapore day!
5
Came here with my girlfriend, we had black forest, lemon and milk chocolate. It is very interesting to see how they are made. Nice atmosphere, unique process, very good ice cream. I cannot understand people complaining about tastelessness and price. It is not much more expensive than buying a Magnum in the supermarket
4
After hearing a lot of praise about this place, thought I give it a shot. I’m just gonna share the walking route I took from train station to the café; it’s a bit different from the one shown on Google Maps, and hopefully shorter as well =) Simply exit the Little India MRT Station via Exit A, and you should see a carpark just in front of you. All you need to do is make a right turn and walk through the carpark; the café is right across the road from where the carpark is! It’s that simple!Now that you know where the café is, let’s get straight to their ice cream! Every serving of ice cream is made fresh upon order, using super-cooled nitrogen at minus 320 Fahrenheit (if I’m not mistaken), hence the name! The entire process takes approximately about 3-4 minutes, sometimes longer if there are orders ahead of you, and what you get is a really fresh and smooth ice cream end product. There are many different flavours you can choose from, ranging from simpler ones like fruits to more premium ones like black forest; but really, you can mix and match whatever flavours they have to your liking. Since I was new to the place, I decided to order their more popular flavours, namely Black Forest (S$6) and Christmas Horlicks (I think it was S$5.60). The Black Forest flavour was awesome! It really tasted like I was eating a black forest cake, and it even came served with a literal cherry on top! The Christmas Horlicks is actually Horlicks-flavoured ice cream folded with honeycomb as well as Oreo cookies bits. I didn’t like this as much as the Black Forest; I got a tad annoyed at having honeycomb pieces stuck to my teeth… Service-wise, the staff were quite polite and pleasant, though they did miss out on my order; my friends and I ordered 6 flavours, of which they made only 5. I had to go back and remind them before they realised they missed it. Nevertheless, they were really apologetic about it, so it’s not too big a deal.Anyway, I was so impressed with their Black Forest (S$16.80) that I got take-home packs for that flavour, along with another popular Thai Coconut flavour (S$15.50). The latter was filled with generous amounts of refreshing coconut bits, but my ice cream was all crumbly, as if it were too “dry” or something. Lastly, I would also suggest bringing along your own cooler bags if you’re getting take-home packs, as they only pack it in a plastic bag with no dry-ice whatsoever
4
Simply love this ice-cream café! They never fail to amaze me with their ingenuity in coming up with new flavors. Today’s visit brought a nice surprise – Pink Guava. It’s lovely! It’s pink! It’s fragrant! It’s yummylicious! There were real guava flesh!!The Thai coconut has always been a popular flavor at 320 Below and it is always good! Not too sweet, yet you could taste the sweet coconut flesh. It’s a must-try.One of the flavors I really like is the Blackforest, it’s like eating the actual Blackforest cake! There was once I mixed peanut butter with banana and it’s really good. That’s the fun part, we could mix different flavors, watch the vapor-flowing mixing process and taste the end product!I really like the alcoholic ones, my favorite is Tequila Caramel, with Mojito coming in second!The pastries are not too bad, especially the Lava Cake. A set of Lava cake with vanilla ice-cream is $8.90 and the waffles set is $7.90; a good deal. I would certainly visit again and again as long as 320 Below keeps up with their lovely -320degF creations! I could still remember the fragrance and the great taste of sour-sop and chempedek when those fruits were in season; they were just amazing! Wonder what’s next after Pink Guava? 
5
We went here after a long day of exploring the city. This place is fantastic!!! The flavours were so pure making the ice cream some of the best I have ever had in my life! Had the blackforest (Amazingly chocolately) and the Thai coconut (Subtle and real coconut flesh chunks!). The store excepts cash only so hit an ATM on the way. Free water provided. Small store so seating may be limited. We went back a second time it was so good. Highly recommend this as the perfect place to cool down or to have dessert
5
I don't always eat ice cream but this is irresistible. The texture of the ice cream is smooth and its not so sweet. The ice cream is using fresh ingredient and the ice cream is made on the spot! Highly recommended to try it out!
4
Just last week ago i go to this place..The ice cream processing made is unique,and the taste is also delicious.We both order the favorite taste,NY Cheese and Thai Coconut.Great concept and unique taste
5
A must have if you are there! OMG! Also tried the new flavour - Mango Rice Pudding! Yummy... Still love the Thai Coconut which is a perfect match for the Waffle and Bread&Butter. Finally, we bought 4 tubs of Black Forest at S$16.80/tub. Bring back the sweet potato, please
5
Was plesantly surprised to see 320 Below at Tampines One (Basement - next to Cold Storage). Quickly stock up our ice creams - still loving their ala-minute ice creams. Got hooked with their Black Forest & Rum Raisins beside the all time favourite Thai Coconut! Yeah...so near oue house now
5
More than just innovative, the ice cream here offers quality. They are less in sugar and do not use emulsifier, stabilizers, preservatives. Rest assure that this is safe for consumption because the nitrogen evaporates and leaves no residue. This place also accepts customization orders for any wacky flavors you can think of. I can't wait to try the flavours which I have marked out when I return to Little India next time
3
If you've never been here before, or never had ice cream made instantly using liquid nitrogen, try it once but more than quality ice cream, it's the amusement value of seeing how it's made.We tried the Pink grapefruit ice cream, Rum and raisin ice cream and the Horlicks. They were nice. The grapefruit was the best of the three but I didn't quite like the texture or consistency of the ice cream. People said it was creamy but I found it a bit chalky or flakey
5
These ice creams are made on the spot using liquid nitrogen to freeze them. The result is a creamy, slightly crumbly ice cream that's unlike anything you've ever had. The flavours are as subtle as they are unique: earl grey, horlicks, nutella - though they also serve the traditional vanilla and coconut.Worth a trip
3
I tried it but really can't find anything special about the ice cream, and its expensive some more! Been reading many good thing about this place, but either i tried the wrong ice cream (that coconut, its suppose to be one of the most fave one there) or it just didnt mee my taste
1
Unique concept yes. We were excited and walked about a bit to get this place. Nice cafe setting inside, though the place could have been a bit larger and tables wider to accommodate a family of 4. We tried different flavors. However, we didnt enjoy the flavors and also felt it was fairly bland. Not worth the trouble, is what me and my family felt
5
This was my first experience with nitro ice cream - and what an introduction!! Just seeing them make ice cream right before your ice is worth the visit let alone the freshest, creamiest, most deliciously unique ice cream you'll ever taste! Not only because of the quality of their ingredients but also because of the uniqueness of them! I had the coconut flavor which had yummy little fresh pieces in there.Definitely worth a try, retry, and regular visit
4
I like the whole concept. Small , simple , clean and friendly staff . Their lava cake and bread butter pudding w ice cream yummy . Some selection of ice cream were average but on whole awesome experience . You feel so relax and chill.
5
Simply the best & irresistible! Love the "Thai Coconut". Must try the "Lava Cake Combo" with a scoop of ice cream. We ended up buying 4 tubs of ice-creams: Thai Coconut; Salted Caramel; NY Cheese & Bailey Choco. Yummilicious...
5
Visitors coming down to little india...dont miss this experience..
Liquid to icecream in seconds... awesome.
its a treat for little children,
4
Visited this place with my friends and we all love the ice cream!! A wide variety of flavours to choose from, you just cant finish choosing what flavour to enjoy! A cozy atmosphere and very creative design of the shop made it just a comfy place to catch up with friends
5
We simply love these ice-creams and stocked up our freezer with these flavors in tubs - Banana with Apple Cinnamon; Black Forest; Chempedak; Ginger Honey; Man-conut; Mojitios; Nutella; NY Cheesecake; Peanut Butter; Salted Caramel with Peanut Butter; Red Wine; Sangria; Summer Fruits; Sweet Potato;Thai Coconut; and Yuzi.The best about them are without artificial flavorings or essences!! Oh...their Bread Butter Pudding and Dates Cake are simply awesome! The BEST, our friends are loving their ice-creams too
4
Just near Little India you can get ice-cream made from flavours of your choice with nitrogen right in front of you. Fun for the novelty factor! My husband had an interesting blue cheese and rum and raison combo while the kids I stuck to more traditional combos such as raspberry and chocolate with choc chips; Grapefruit and lemon and blood orange and mango with marshmallows. Ice cream tastes much like standard ice cream but it was very fun to pick flavours and see it made in front of you
3
After reading so much about their Thai coconut ice cream i bought two tubs and to my dismay i found that the ice cream did not have a strong essence of coconut. In fact, it is rather normal. I am not sure if its because the tub ice creams are ready made and have been in storage but for $15.50 a tub, it is definitely not worth it
5
OMG...the best ice cream ever had in my life. The Thai Coconut; the Man-conut; the Sweet Potato; the Nutella; the Salted Caramel; the Sangria; the Mojito; the Black Florest; and the newest flavor - Chempedak; just got us addicted and went back again and again. We are already stocking up their ice-creams for the festive period. 5 Stars rating to the owner & the chef who created such havenly flavors! Yum Yum..
5
A very cute ambiance and decor, friendly staff, awesome ice cream. What can I say more, I may get addictive and com e back and back again if still in Sin. Black Forest is great and so do Coconut and Chocolate ice cream. There are a great selection with full flavor from common one to very strange and creative
4
The selling point of 320 Below Nitro Ice Cream is the really watching the making of the ice-cream. I brought my kids and they really enjoy watching the smoke from the nitrogen and the cool effects. There is a good selection of ice-cream choice (all written on the board) and it took us awhile to figure out what we want. I was hoping the staff can make some recommendation but their respond were "everything is nice", "it depends on your preference" which aren't helpful at all. Nonetheless, we settle for Peanut Oreo and Salted Caramel. They both taste GREAT! They also serve cakes and desserts. We ordered a lava cake with vanilla ice-cream and it was incredible. The place is casual and comfy. Great place for couple, friends and family
5
My last day in Singapore, we decided to try 320 below. Unexpectedly, my mom really enjoyed it! There are so many flavors! We finally decided to try peanut butter and tiramisu. It taste so great! Definitely will come back again.
5
Great range of flavours (some sound delicious, some a bit scary), this is such a fun idea. Staff are friendly, opens late. Now, the concept means pretty much that its food (well. ice cream) and an entertainment experience at the same time as its fascinating to see ice cream made with nitrogen! Funky decor, very futuristic which makes sense as its a very futuristic way of making my favourite dessert. The pineapple was delicious, creamy and soft enough (I dont like "hard" ice cream)! Waaay cheaper than Ben & Jerry''s and just as yummy. Check it out if you are in the area, MRT at Little India and take the MacKenzie Road exit (think it was exit A
5
the ice cream here is like nothing ive ever experienced before.1. i have sensitivity to cold, but the ice cream forms so perfectly that it doesn bother my teeth at all.2. i have personal issues with texture, especially in ice cream. the way they create the ice cream makes it so consistently smooth the only reason i was upset when i left was because i didnt have a freezer in my hotel to take a tub back with me
5
I love 320! My husband and I visited tonight and were not disappointed! The owner is so friendly, and we were able to see how they freshly make each order! I love the fact that 320's ice cream isn't too sweet and it isn't melty at all since it's made at 320 degrees below! We got 4 ice creams in total: Christmas Horlicks, Honey Ginger, Black Forest and NY cheesecake! They were all amazing! What's best is they use real honeycomb in the horlicks! As for the Honey Ginger, it truly hit the spot. The ginger was so fragrant! The prices are very affordable, as the portions are very large (we are from N. America, where we are accustomed to everything being jumbo size, and we were happy!).My husband is an ice creamaholic and thinks this is the best ice cream he's ever tried. Me- I don't have a sweet tooth, and normally couldn't care less about ice cream. .. but 320's making some superb ice cream. So absolutely do not miss out if you're in Little India! What a gem!!!!!
5
You cannot missed the vibrant coloured signage when you passed by this ice cream cafe. My kid had his Art lesson nearby and we decided to have some nitrogen made ice cream with my hubby and daughter while waiting for my son to finish his lesson. I highly recommended the premium Black Forest ( It has real cherry in it . I like the overall taste ) . Holicks , milk chocolate , coconut are so Yums ! I think the pricing is reasonable given the portion is really pretty generous . Seeing how the ice cream is made is really a pleasant experience . Actually it can be a little addictive , Trust me you will start to wonder how the rest of the flavours taste the moment your ice cream cup is empty ... wanting for more ! So we were asked by the staff if we want to try the papaya milk flavour , well we were all ready to say Yes ! After trying , we felt the latter one is a tad too sweet but it might suit some if you have a sweet tooth . I personally like the other flavours mentioned earlier . They have v interesting flavours like Tim Tam , sweet potato etc . What a wide range right ? I think we will come back for more . The ambience is kind of relaxing too !
4
I and my younger sisters are interested in 320 Below Nitro Cream Cafe at the first time we saw it . Its design is so pretty with clorful chairs and table . My sisters are so happy and so do I . Ice cream is unique. We love chocolate ice cream here so much . Their toppings are so various for you to enjoy . It s not only for children but also for everybody . We will be back when we have chanc
5
We found this little cafe whilst staying at the Soluxe Inn in Little India and were pleasantly surprised. The ice cream is prepared in front of the customers and is delicious.The place is well decorated and it has a good atmosphere. If you are in the area, we recommend stopping by this place for an ice cream or two
5
I came across this Cafe which serves a very different kind of ice cream: Nitro Cream! I had heard about it before but never tasted it. As an ice cream 'expert' (yes, I eat ice cream many times per week...) I was rather amazed by the natural taste and freshness of Nitro Cream.They use fresh product and mix all ingredients the way you want it, then freeze it over in seconds using nitro (a natural substance, which we all breathe in daily as part of our air).Apart from being fun to watch whilst it is being made right in front of you, the taste is far more natural, not as sugary and simply more interesting than ice cream !Why can't I buy Nitro Cream in my local supermarket ?I highly recommend a visit to 320 Below. Or more than just one visit..
5
Twice in one day - must be good.Loved the flavour combinations and the fact that you can get yoghurt and sorbets too. There are so many options - I liked the fact that they have a Tim Tam option with the little flag for the Aussies out there. :)Do give it a try if you are anywhere near Little India. Take the MTR underpass (exit MacKenzie Rd) and it's just across from the exit. Look for the colourful sign across the car park.And the service is outstanding
4
We just happened to walk past this Icecream place and the kids wanted to go in and I wanted to see Icecream happening before my eyes . The place is meticulously clean , the choice of flavours was great and we got to see our Icecream being made - sans preservatives, coloring substances , and additives ! By the time we were done with watching , we were raring to go and the icecreams were great - not too sweet or heavy , just perfect ! I will definitely be visiting this place again - and pretty soo
5
Definitely a must visit and experience the liquid nitrogen ice cream made fresh In front of you. Strongly recommend .
5
Certainly an experience great ice cream and great fun to watch it made in front of you with the liquid nitrogen - loved the raspberry.
Thank you
5
What a brilliant place, we went in just as it opened and stayed for an hour eating three serves each. The ice creams are super tasty with the option to mix in fun extras (tequila or blue cheese are standouts).Get yourself onto 320 Below, have a chat about what you like to the friendly folks and enjoy. It's that simple really
5
We stood out the front of 320 Below on a rainy Sunday arvo just waiting for it to open - we were that eager to try this ice cream. My partner had discovered this place on Trip Advisor and insisted that we come during our three day visit to Singapore I am so glad we did. We sampled six amazing (and at times, surprising) ice cream concoctions, and were extremely grateful for the expert advice provided by the wonderful husband and wife team behind the counter. The liquid nitrogen creates an unbelievably smooth and delicate ice cream which carries the natural flavours so very well. The standouts for us were the blue cheese with rum and raisin (just try it), New York cheesecake with raspberry, tequila and salted caramel and the dark chocolate and chilli. If we had any more space we would've kept going but the ice cream coma struck us down when we were trying so hard to eat more. Gutted. 320 Below is a wonderful place to enjoy ice cream 'as you like it' accompanied by a little bit of theatre and a lot of yum.The couple that run this place are lovely and were really fun and helpful, we really enjoyed the hour and a half we spent here - you will too.
5
We were staying at the Soluxe Inn and this is two doors down in a quiet part on the fringe of Little India. It was a hot afternoon so my partner convinced me to pop in.I have never really enjoyed ice cream until this experience. The ingredients are natural (no stabilisers etc) so it feels lighter and more refreshing than what I've had in the past. Also there are different options - ice cream, yoghurt and cheesecake (& something else). You can pick many pure fruit-based ones, alcoholic ones or just create your own. The fit out of the shop is modern and stylish and the staff were great too - cheeky and fun. If you find other brands a bit sickly and want more natural ingredients, definitely give it a try. Exit A from Little India station...you will see the colourful sign just across the car park - about 50m away
4
The ice cream itself is not special, but I really like the concept and I can say it's healthy ice cream. Made in front of you from the scratch with very simple ingredients such as milk & sugar using my favorite kitchen equipment, Artisan Kitchen Aid mixer and sprayed with nitrogen.I love watching really watching it
3
I saw the cafe at trip advisor and luckily the place is very near our hotel. I have been dying to try their ice cream since day one. However, they only open from friday to sunday. The place was decorated very nice with added personal touch through the handwritten board, signages that not only reminds but speaks to you, and what looks like art project cups. They have plenty of flavors and most are unique to them. It was really hard to choose but in the end I chose a safe tiramisu. They make the ice cream in front of you. It was amazing to watch. And the idea that no bacteria can live in 360 degrees temperature is very nice. The ice cream is interesting, it has the right amount of sweetness, it is not too sweet but I'm looking for the ice cream's usual thicker texture. The texture felt more icey than creamy but the taste is delicious. I still prefer the normal creamy ice cream but It wouldn't hurt to try, it might be your kind of ice cream
4
Wanted to check this place out for some time already but then realised it was closed. Was very happy it finally reopened but then it only operates from Fri to Sun now.It was a very small but cosy café. The flavours available are unique and rarely available elsewhere. The price is very reasonable considering the ice cream is made fresh after you order. It is located opposite Rex cinema. The closest train station is Little India. Use Exit A and cut through the car park and you can see the café.We ordered 2 ice cream flavours and a waffle to go along with them for our group of 2A1C. It was so good we decided to have another cup.Highly recommended as ice cream served here is very different from those served in other ice cream parlours. After all at 320 Below Nitro, ice cream is made fresh and not scooped from tubs
4
I went to Nitro amidst much hype when I saw that it was the #1 recommended eating hole on Tripadvisor. Our group ordered Thai Red Bean Black Rice, TimTamToff, Apple Cinnamon and Salted Caramel. On the plus side, the prices were very decent for the portion, they only serve one size at $4.80 (regular flavors) . I have not had ice cream that doesn't load it with lots of sugar, it is so pure you can really taste the full flavor minus the sweetness. Our Saltee Caramel was my favorite, I really love the saltiness level, it was woo-ahh for me. Did not enjoy the TimTamToff nor the Red Bean Black Rice. Apple cinnamon was so so also. The flavors of the ice cream did not scream out at me, at times I wondered what am I eating?! The thing about this place is, you'll find many quirky flavors that you wouldn't be able to find elsewhere. Though their ice cream is so-so, you should at least try it once because IT WAS REALLY COOL TO SEE HOW THEY MAKE ICE CREAM:)

When we first step into the place, we were amazed at the effort it took to decorate an ice cream shop. Kudos to the ID person. Since it's our first time here, we didnt know what to order and the plesant staff was quick to recommend Grapefruit while my partner chose banana. They were both very delicious ice cream, there were bits of fruits in them which adds a different texture to the dessert. Not too sweet, just nice

Absolutely love the business concept and the Ice cream. Free from preservatives and tastes amazing!!! Very friendly staff as well!!

Great ice cream and sorbet! The best rum and raisin I have ever had! We had two rounds of ice cream!!!

We stopped in to 320 after lunch. We had a lovely time in the cafe, which was light, airy and spacious. There are lots of intresting flavours to choose from. We ordered raspberry icecream, vanilla icecream and grapefruit with lime sorbet . All were good, but the grapefruit and lime sorbet was delicious and refreshing (with actual bits of grapefruit). We found the service to be very friendly and helpful. If you are unsure what to order the owner will be very happy to help. The cafe is easy to find, just follow exit A from the Little India metro stop and the cafe is across the road in the right hand side.

It's really a shame that a ice cream outlet could have such lousy ice cream and service. No wonder there is few customers

We initially tried to visit the cafe a few weeks ago but it was closed during that time. They have since re-opened and at the moment are open on Friday, Saturday and Sundays only. As soon as we heard that they had re-opened, we rushed down ASAP! On Saturday, we went for an afternoon snack. It's very easy to find (either walk from Selegie road and its opposite Rex cinemas), or if you're taking the train, the closest is Little India station. You walk to exit A (follow the signs for Mackenzie road) and you will come up at the parking lot opposite the cafe. It is lovely and air conditioned (which is wonderful after walking around all day). They have a large board of all the different flavours to choose from - we had a hard time deciding but we eventually settled on salted caramel with honeycomb and also a peanut butter with Oreo ice cream. It was really fun to watch them mix it up in the big colourful mixers, then blast it with the nitrogen gas to freeze it! The result is a deliciously creamy and balanced ice cream. The salted caramel was a little bit *too* salty, but I loved the honeycomb.We loved our experience so much, we couldn't resist and went back for more the next day! This time, we tried a raspberry with choc chips, dark choc with honeycomb and a banana with honey and walnuts. Can't wait to go back for more! For around $5 a cup (depending on flavours, etc) it is definitely worth it. Our new favourite ice cream - A*

The flexibility of mixing different flavors is a lot of fun. The ice cream has a very pure, clean flavor which left us feeling much better (less full) than other ice creams do. The texture and creaminess are fantastic. I highly recommend the Thai Coconut ice cream. I will return soon to try dark-chocolate and blue-cheese, a combination recommended by the owners, who run the shop and show a lot of passion for this unique dessert concept. Highly recommended for kids, as the ice cream making process is fun to watch.In short - a great escape from Singapore heat. Give it a try

If you have kids, go there without a doubt. They would love the experience of Nitrogen fumes overflowing and escaping from the small openings at the bottom of the working window - infact the whole experience of ice cream making from ingredients - it got me excited too. The ice cream is actually nice, doesnt feel that it is low on sugar and fats - and you know it as it is made right infront of you. And while you are at it, DO NOT MISS the WAFFLE (period)!!!. It was quiet crowded when we visited, might have been due to Friday night (they are open until 12 AM on Friday).Having been in Singapore for more than a year now, I didnt know that this place existed! Got to know about it through Tripadvisor.(if you are having difficulty with the directions, it is exactly across the street from Rex Cinema which is across the road from Tekka Center

My wife and I came from the USA to spend 20 days in Southeast Asia. The food of course filled our bellies and our souls, but we were often left desiring more when it came to dessert. Below Nitro conquered our desire for fantastic dessert. This place offers so many options to flavor your ice cream. It's fun to watch them mix and create your ice cream. The setting is cute and appropriate for an ice cream shop. In addition, they do a great job achieving a creamy texture using the liquid nitrogen.We thought prices were very fair. If you are in the area, you should certainly stop by for a delicious treat to help you cool off
4
A must try for everyone. Kids and adults will love how the creamy goodness and the velvety sensation in the mouth taste. Salted caramel is just perfect for me but they still got lots of flavors to choose from. The cafÃ© also got a funky ambiance that's great for chilling out with friends
5
I've been there once and i don't regret it!! It's easy to find this cafe. Just take MRT to little india and walk for about 1-2 minutes from exit A. This cafe is very clean and nicely decorated. I was confused what I want order because all of flavors look good in the blackboard. FYI you can see the various flavor and price in my photo ;). Finally, I ordered lemon ice cream and I can see directly how the ice cream made with nitrogen. It was so awesome!! It's unique, worth, and recommended. I will come back If i visit Singapore again.
5
The icecream is very smooth and the choice of flavors is fantastic including some that are alcohol based. Having it made right in front of you with an explanation of the process is a real eye opener. Good prices compared to portion sizes.
5
Really goooooood ice cream! They only make it once you order! Fresh ingredients! You'll keep coming back to try all the other amazing flavors they have. :)

After reaching much appreciating review from other reviewer , went to try this unique ice cream cafe in pouring rain of singapore,The board on your left as you enter explains clearly about the flavour of ice cream with photo graph down, i tried the salted caramel and my friend tried christian horliks which got an oreo cookies added to itAll in for a price under $ 6 each we got a smooth texture unique nitro ice creamWhat else to ask fo

Last week, i went to Singapore and visit this cafe. Its very easy to find, just take MRT, ride down at Little India exit A. There are so many choices of ice cream that you can try, even you can make any creaction you wish. The cafe is very clean and the staff very friendly. I ordered Baileys chocolate, the taste is so nice. I love the way the creative the ice cream are made. You can see directly how the ice cream are being made, and its very very interesting to see. I mean that i never seen before. The process of ice cream maker about 3 minutes, then the ice cream is ready to melt on your mouth. The price is not cheap but its worth
5
Hands down the best ice cream in south east asia....To order you first need to decide which flavor that you want... Once they get your order they will start putting all the ingredient into the mixer and spray some liquid nitrogen... Voila... Your ice cream made to order is ready for your enjoyment We tried the salted caramel flavor ice cream and it was so awesome... We cant wait to come back to try different flavo
5
Worth visiting just for the experience of watching the ice cream being made. Easy to get to from Little India or Orchard Road. Prices start at $4.80 but you can make any creation you wish. Clean setting, friendly staff. Only wish we could have gone back to try some other flavours (mulled wine or caramelised onion ice cream???)Loved the salted caramel with honeycomb.Doesn't open until after 1pm in the afternoo
5
So glad to have this ice cream cafe near my hotel, soluxe inn. I tried it after saw good reviews in the internet. The cafe is comfy and quite large, many people hangout there. It offers various yummy flavour of ice cream, and other desserts. I ordered christmas horlicks which is horlicks with honeycomb and oreo, they said it's a bestseller beside dark chocolate. The most attractive show comes when they make the ice cream, they mix the ingredients like milk etc into the mixer and then add the nitrogen. Then voila! Here goes the ice cream. Taste so delicious! The price is really worth it
5
A real treat. Just across the road from the MRT station Little India, take the Mackenzie Road exit and walk through a small car park and you will see the shop front on Mackenzie Road. We had our own invention of vanilla & Cointreau which was lovely and fresh. The flavours are natural and the ice cream very creamy with no ice, not overly sweet and really delicious. Good quality alcohol is used and you can watch your ice cream being made. We also had salted caramel with tequila and rum raisin with blue cheese - might sound odd but the cheese is subtle and heightens the other flavours. Great fun, good value & excellent friendly servic

I've tasted a number of ice creams & this is simply the best. Most ice creams have all sorts of additional fillings or stuffings like nuts & fruits that mask the actual flavour of the ice cream. When you actually taste that, it's not so great.But in 320 Below Nitro Cream Cafe, the quality of the ice cream is is evident

Click HERE : http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg for Full Review and Pictures!After an earlier Indian vegetarian meal at Ananda Bhavan, we walked to an ice cream shop that strangely, has no signs of ice cream on display."Huh? No ice cream?Then how to order?". As we looked around, there were Kitchen-Aid Mixers, some chemical pipes and a black board full of various flavors of ice cream. Sounds like Dexter Laboratory? Yes it is!  The ice cream here is made fresh upon order by using liquid nitrogen at below -320 degrees Celsius to freeze the raw ice cream custard. The two flavors we tried, Salted Caramel ($4.80) and Cookie Doodle($5.20). The latter was made up of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and crushed cookies. Thanks to this quick freeze method, both are creamy and velvety, without any icy crystals that obstructs your taste pleasure. More than just innovative, the ice cream here offers quality. They are less in sugar and do not use emulsifier, stabilizers, preservatives. Rest assure that this is safe for consumption because the nitrogen evaporates and leaves no residue....Visit www.dairycream.blogspot.sg for full post.This place also accepts customization orders for any wacky flavors you can think of. I can't wait to try the flavours which I have marked out when I return to Little India next time
5
All natural product and huge range of flavours. Great service. Watch the ice cream being made in minutes. Great concept.
5
I dropped by at this ice cream parlour & shared a few cups of ice cream with a friend. Since they had such a great variety of flavours, I decided to have an ice cream party with family at home. Everyone loved it especially the ones with the hard liquour like Bailey's & Tequila. Even the normal Rum & Raisin tastes so good!I must definitely bring my friends from Australia who are ice cream lovers

I had to try this place and I panicked when we arrived at 12:59 pm to see the place closed.I saw the hours posted on the window, which said that they open at 1pm. thank goodness. on time, Susan opened up and gave us a friendly greeting. wasn't disappointed. The "show" of making the ice cream right in front of you with the freezing smoke rising from the mixing bowl was really fun to watch. I tried rum raisin, which used Meyers rum and dark raisins. What I liked about it was that it wasn't cloyingly sweet, but rather rum- and raisin-flavored. While the texture wasn't as creamy as Italian gelato, it was lighter and less filling. Soooo, after my husband finished his bananas and honeycomb, which was sweet and crunchy, we shared a salted caramel. Yum. I would love to try a dozen more, but we leave today.Yogurt and sorbet can also be use
5
I can recommend this ice cream place to anybody. If you are looking for a new experience "ice cream wise" than this is the pace to go! The ice cream is so smooth and tastes wonderful, on top of that the variety of flavors is amazing! I have never been a big ice cream person. but this is a place I keep on wanting to go back to over and over again
1
Tried the ice cream based on the rave reviews and could not be more disappointed. I've tried the best ice cream all over the world (including Chin Chin Labs the first nitro ice cream in London/Europe) and this was rubbish. Execution was so poor - yes it's supposed to be 'fresh', no stabilisers, no preservatives yada yada yada but my ice cream was absolutely tasteless. Even worse, the texture! It was all 'broken', icy and not creamy at all. $4.80 for a hardly full cup (no topping) was a total rip off. People rate it well probably because they order it filled with mix-ins, so they're really eating/tasting the cookies and what not, not the ice cream. The man who served me wasn't the warmest person either. Also they might want to invest in some proper spoons, the wooden sticks do not help the taste (or lack thereof) of the ice cream
5
Had a fabulous experience. The service was excellent, the ice cream was unbelievable. All five of us tried different flavors. I liked mine the best it's called Elvis, It had chocolate, bananas and peanut butter in it. I wish i had time to go again and try more flavours and its really cool to watch how they make the ice cream. This place is definitely recommended! It has become my favourite ice cream place ever!
4
I'm a fan of Ice Cream. So while in Singapore went to this particular palour. Service and Decor were awesome. Ice Cream was sadly a let down. Got R2 Mango which is a premium and a Passionfruit. Both were not full of flavour as hoped. As stated everything else was great about this place though.
5
I've been here a few times and feel right at home everytime I go. First the service is excellent, it's a family run place (husband & wife) and they're both very friendly, always showing concern as to whether or not the ice cream was up to satisfaction and always available for a casual chat. DON'T ask them what they recommend, it's up to you what your tastes are, but having said that, so far, all of the flavours I've tried (and I've tried many) have been excellent. If for whatever reason it doesn't work the flavour can be adjusted, just talk nicely to the friendly people behind the counter, and I'm sure they'll see what they can do next time.The Ice Cream... what can I say.. AMAZING!!!! it's extremely pure, you can see what they put into it when you stand there, so you can be assured there's no artificial colouring or flavouring..... Just try one of the fruity flavours (I personally took a liking today to the Cointreau / grapefruit), - the grapefruit is pinkish, the cointreau is clear, but the overwhelming ingredient being the cream makes the concoction white, (but you can still see the pink sacs in the ice cream). I'm sure that any other brand or make of icecream would have added something to make it pink, which is really what most people would expect for a pink grapefruit ice cream. The flavours may be subtle, possibly not what you're used to, because of the lack of artificial flavouring.The whole process does take a few minutes, it's fascinating to watch, the liquid, followed by the nitrogen freezing, as the saying goes "all good things to those who wait".. and as I'm trying to get across to you, it is good.Alot of the ingredients are made on the premises, the honeycomb, the chinese new year pineapple tarts, the purees for the various flavours, to name but a few. - and that's another thing, more interesting flavours keep being added, for Australia day they had Tim Tam (biscuits) with toffee.... For Xmas it was Horlicks / Oreo, this CNY it's Mandarin Orange, the pineapple tart was also nice, the traditional pineapple tart jam is mixed with the icecream whereas the tart is mixed in to give a crunchy texture. If you're really adventurous just tell them what kind of mix you'd like, they're very accommodating, having said that, be warned, some of what you decide to mix may work, some might not, just like I said earlier, it's up to individual tastes.The price is very reasonable, being comparable to any other premium ice cream, but of course, like i've mentioned, very pure. They have several interesting flavours, such as Chilli/Chocolate, Garlic/peanut butter, Ginger/honey, as well as the traditional ones, - vanilla, chocolate, banana etc. Quite a large menu (lots of alcoholic ones too!)If you are looking for good icecream, a nice place to go with your friends to hang out, or really do care about what goes in to your body, this is the place to go. There's ample parking right outside the shop

For pics and more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatWhen i was younger, i never understood why people said ice cream is unhealthy. How can something made of milk be, when it is an essential part of our daily calcium intake? Well, i am still in denial even after knowing it's made from fatty cream but now, i've found an ice cream parlor that actually makes its ice cream from fresh milk and that is 320 Below Nitro Cream Cafe. They also happen to be the first ice cream cafe to freeze its ice cream using nitrogen. This special cafe doesn't have the usual tubs of ice cream on display and there's no tasting of the flavors. This is because all the ice cream are made fresh on the spot, right in front of you. It may take a while but there're absolutely no emulsifiers, stabilizers or preservatives used at all. So in goes the fresh and natural ingredients AND the milk into the colorful home mixers. Then blasts the nitrogen gas which quick freezes the mixture at -320.4 Fahrenheit. The quick freeze process ensures there is no build up of ice crystals and hence the end mixture is a smooth and molecular gastronomy sorta melt. One moment it's there, and the next it's gone, leaving only a light trace of the flavors once present. There is none of that heavy and oily aftertaste and it feels like you can go on eating tubs after tubs after tubs..The flavors are rather extensive as you can tell from the board. The red colored ones are flavors that could be made in the yogurt or sorbet form. The level of sweet is really dependent on the natural flavors of the ingredient so some must taste a little more bland than others.My current favorite is the Christmas Horklicks. They should keep this on the menu. If not, just get the Horlicks flavor and add in honeycomb and oreo. Fantastic combination.They also do tubs and delivery! Don't say i never share. ;
5
Probably the best ice cream i've ever eaten. They have a lot of different tastes, and some of them i've never seen before (garlic for example). They make the ice cream in front of you and it's really cool to watch. A bit pricy (4.5$/ball) but it's worth it
5
Great place to chill out, staff extremely helpful gave very good tourist info.
Ice cream the best I have ever tasted freshly made and so much choice I will be back!!
5
Great concept and the end product was really good, the staff were both lovely too. Definitely worth the visit!
4
They have a good selection of flavors, including alcoholic choices for adults, and a few experimental flavors as well. You get to watch as they mix cream and liquid nitrogen into a surprisingly smooth ice cream.
5
If you're an ice-cream/yogurt junkie, then this is the place that you have to go! The place serves an array of ice cream, sobert and yogurt that will not disappoint and it definitely goes well with the amazing ambiance! So do check it out
5
This is a really cute place with really awesome flavour options. Ice cream is a great texture and comes with a little entertainment. This place is rocking.
5
Near to Little India outside exit A of the MRT station. Interesting spectacle with the liquid nitrogen freezing fresh ingredients. Big selection of flavours including garlic (experimental...). Good service and the owners seem committed to the concept. Worth a trip to check it out.
5
Quite literally ran into this place trying to find my hostel in the rain. Had one of their (amazing!) ice cream flavour combos while I was waiting for the torrential rain to ease up. The owner was lovely and helped me to work out where I was going and even called a cab for me (there were none on a Saturday afternoon)!! Thanks so much - I'll definitely be going back on my next trip to Singapore!! :
5
Great place! Went with 8 friends and had some great ice cream. Very cool concept (apols for the pun) and they are happy to mix the different flavours. Try the Ginger and honey with the whisky flavour - you'll thank me. They are also up for trying new ingredients too which is great. Thoroughly recommend this place especially on a hot Singapore evening
4
I have tried many ice creams from across the world so i can say this isnt the best ..however its pretty damn good ..u can really taste the flavours! Strong sweet mixtures and you can request your own concoction they have some unusual gimmicky flavours and i think it adds to the fun and wonder of this parlouri am glad i went and i think its definitly worth going to since singapore is small and this is my prefered place for ice cream!!The inside is cute and cozy a good location but the defibitly need a bigger sign or at least another one telling ur close!
4
I haven't come across nitro ice cream before and but as a dedicated follower of Ben and Jerry had to give this one a go. Really good ice cream and an entertaining process watching it being made. All it needs to now is a good espresso machine
5
Because the nitrogen freezes the ice cream so fast the crystals are really small giving a incredibly smooth ice cream. Cost was 5 SGD.
5
Amazing concept ... Freshly made ice-cream on the spot. Love that you can choose the flavors. Best thing is the taste... Creamiest ice-cream ever.
Totally recommend.
5
This cafe was near our hotel and we couldn't resist trying it! The ice cream is freshly made to order using liquid nitrogen. Its great fun to watch and the end result is fantastic - this is the smoothest textured ice cream i've tasted. Good choice of flavours too. The coconut was particularly good. Its close to the Little India MRT stop
5
Fresh ice cream made while you wait, what a great concept! It's interesting to watch, my kids loved it. Lots of great flavours as well. Our favourities were Peanut butter, Caramel, Vanilla , Chocolate and the surprise was Raspberry, never knew those could taste so good
5
It is very rare that a restaurant, cafe or bar, succeeds in their quest for that perfect product. Nonetheless, that is exactly what the friendly crew at 320 Below have done with their liquid nitrogen ice cream cafe. Made fresh in front of your eyes (a worthwhile show on its own) the use of liquid nitrogen produces the smoothest, purest ice cream imaginable, brining to life the variety of flavours on offer - peanut and hokey pokey are a must try! Rivaling the outstanding quality of the ice cream is the welcoming and neighborly nature of Keith and Susan who are more than happy to share their passion and knowledge with customers.Ice cream has never tasted this good. Thanks to 320 Below for sharing your passion
5
Try having ice cream on your palette with a different feel.smooth melt in your mouth feel. with flavors bursting! It is totally different for a normal ice cream.put a scoop in your mouth close your eyes and imagine.enjoy your wild imagination and salivate!:
5
Great place, and friendly staff. Been there about 4 times now. Liquid nitrogen ice cream is something I thought was reserved for the likes of Heston Blumenthal and his molecular gastronomy creations, but this place puts a fun twist on the technique and have lots of imaginative flavours available. My favourite is the salted caramel, in a cone (see pic!), so smooth due to the quick freeze. They are also willing to try anything if they have the ingredients, next time I think I will try the salted caramel and soursop mix, which is not on the menu, but someone else has requested it once and it sounds interesting. Just opposite exit A of Little India MRT statio

Here is a new thing in town, FIRST in Singapore!Enough of ready made ice creams.The whole time we are trying ice creams made by artificial flavors, colorings and god knows what?! ! (Do you know???) With all these "unhealthy" ingredients, of course it is beautifully made and taste great… You also pay a "premium" for cheap and unhealthy quality. End of the day, what people wants to have is... great taste!!!!!320below offers an experience in ice cream making right in front of you. Not only that, you are guaranteed fresh ingredients, no artificial flavoring/ colorings, etc… It taste and feel different, refreshing and delicious!!!! Infact, the BEST PART is you could have as many servings without feeling guilty for once! It is as good as making your own ice cream of your choices. you can! Be adventurous as 320below is able to mix and match any flavors that you like….Example chocolate chili (yum yum….)…The price is very reasonable! Remember the goodness in what you are paying for and it’s worth trying! You MUST check it out…. But be prepared as you can be addicted. --320below Addict-
5
I have visited 320 Below 3-4 times and it only opened in October! Its a nice stroll from my condo on Mount Sophia and I'm never disappointed. Keith and Susan take time to educate me on their new flavours and are keen to hear my feedback. I love all the natural flavours and you don't feel heavy after like regular ice cream. I'll be back
5
Visited after walk around Little India. The funky colours drew us in and we were welcomed and the cool process explained to us. This is not your normal ice cream shop as each ice cream is made by hand with natural ingredients; they even created a new one - coffee & Baileys - for my wife. So the ingredients are mixed in front of you and then frozen with liquid nitrogen which makes a fun display for the watching children. The end taste was excellent and we'll be back
