Just name, no good. The food, the delivery, and the cleanliness are all average. There are many better options in Veg in the same area. Git it a miss

right in middle of little India, desperate for healthy and homely veggie food. Was recommended this place by the locals and didnt disappoint on taste or price.
Would recommend this place for low to middle range budget eaters or those just wanting a good dosa.

Kamala Restaurant, Located at 662 Buffalo Rd, #01-16, Singapore just around Tekka Market. This place was recommended by the locals and didn’t disappoint on taste or price. It’s a small budget Restaurant, with good varieties of South Indian food provides feasts and delights that caters to both casual dining and group gatherings. It’s not the cleanest place in town, but due to low to middle range budget the place gets very crowded with their local Indians. Service levels are good and the quality of food is tasty such as, Masala Chicken Briyani, Plain Dosai, and Masala Chicken, just to name a few. Would recommend this place definitely must try if you are in the mood for Indian flavors

The first place I sought out on my first day in Singapore. It was also the last place I returned to the day before my departure. The place is not the cleanest but the food makes you forget all that. It is priced very well and you get plenty of it. No long wait and no problems with doggie bags. It was tasty and yes a telling is how many Indians were there and the line was out the door. No formalities; if you choose to eat with bare hands - no problem. Highly recommend

you know you're in a good Indian restaurant when there are more Indians than non-Indians eating there. ordering was at a counter (where you paid after ordering) and since the only menu was on a wall 3 meters away, you had to know what to order before you got to the counter. and if you are familiar the way Indians talk and act, you have to think and talk fast, just like them (which is not a bad thing really). we had the chicken biryani and papadom. i am not an Indian, but that was one of the tastiest chicken biryanis i've ever had (which is exactly what i expected when eating in an Indian restaurant at Little India). one order was good for 2 persons who were not very hungry. the only downside of the experience was when the waiter (who looked like one of the older uncles of the owners) served our glasses with ice with his finger inside the rim of the glass. oh well

With its array of delicious curries, this street food cafe has some totally delicious meat and vegetable offerings at very reasonable prices. Just around the corner from the Tekka Centre exit on the MTR, this clean and busy street cafe has a whole list of halal foods, Indian breads and chappattis and superb dosas and snacks. Competition for the best curry house in Little India is very steep, but at this price category, the Kamala is a tue contende

I like their chicken masala. its very savoury & pack w spices. their dosa not to my liking. quite dry & hard for the plain dosa, need to pay first at the counter before food is served. its rather inconvenient if wanna add more food to the plate. their hot drinks - tea & coffee serve in a vending kind lookalike cup.thats a big no-no. their fish head curry need to prebooked first

Havent been here for a long time, i went today n find the concept of ordering is different. U order n pay at e cashiers n the servers send the food.

We had dinner at this restaurant Idli, dosa ,Uttapam and you can take south indian meals also at reasonable rates here. Our prime minister Shri Narendra Modi had taken dinner on the same table last year.

This is a small, budget restaurant with good varieties of South Indian food. Since it is usually crowded, bit more cleanliness would make this a better place. Service levels are good and the quality of food is good.
5
It is purely South indian restaurant, you can get all south indian foods with same taste here. this is very famous place in little india.

This is one of the many south Indian restaurant here.A quite a good place. The food is good and tasty.

Went to this place for breakfast...this is one of my favourite thosai restaurant in tekka market ( little india). I would strongly recommend this rava onion thosai....yummyummy....thats the best of the best.anybody who tries this rava thosai will never try other thosais anymore.. the flavour and the crunchyness hmmm yummy yummy. Pls ask for fish curry from the wait staffs. This goes well with that. I also bought vadai.. found the vadai a bit stiff hard. The puri set was also very nice and fluffy.I aslo noticed the chuttneys watery as previosly used to be thick.. the management should look into this and the cashier staffs not friendly and always with a non-happy face. Overall they should maintain their quality

We visited this restaurant with a locally based friend as part of the must-do things when in Singapore from the US, so this review reflects several visits over the years. This restaurant's South Indian cuisine (which is the thing I mainly go there for) is truly authentic. The dosas are all well made, whether the plain ones, or the masala dosa or the onion dosa. The Idlis and vadas as also equally true to form. The accompaniments of sambar and chutneys are all of consistently good quality and we had to ask for refills. Finally, the prices are very reasonable. My companions had the Chole Bhature which looked delicious but I did not have a chance to try that one though it seemed a popular dish. This is a high turnover, low overheads type of place, so you get great value for money but the atmosphere is clearly not the focus and hence the "very good" rating. Highly recommended if in Singapore and you need to satisfy your dosa craving.

Nice indian restaurant with a wide choice of dishes. It's quite busy, so sometimes it may be hard to get a seat, but they offer takeout too. I tried Plain Dosai, it's very good + you get a set of 3 sauces and can use them without any limits. If you're European, you might prefer to get some cutlery for eating your Dosai - it's not a problem, just ask the staff and they'll give you some

I keep going back to this restaurant which is just on the outer side of Tekka Centre.I always have the chicken briyani and it is just lovely!If you are used to spicy food then the chicken gravy would not cause too much drama but if you are not, keep some tissues handy.The portion can be slightly larger than average but a hungry tummy would be able to handle it.The thosai's look very very appealing as well. I have not tried it but I will

This is just like any other non-veg indian curry restaurants that you will find along Little India. Their food has improved but at time good to tast their chutneys as I encountered spoilt coconut chutnes for their tosai years ago. Otherwise they have very good chicken sambal and they use to have honey chicken but this time round I only went for vegetarian
5
This small restaurant in Little India offers fantastic food, mostly vegetarian, it's really busy, queuing sometimes is necessary but we only waited about ten minutes, and the food is absolutely authentic South Indian vegetarian food. Couldn't get enough!

Far and away the best I've ever had. We also tried the various curries and they each had incredible flavour. Highly recommended.
4
The food was very nice ..they cater a lot of variety from north indian to south indian food though we loved the south indian more
4
If you're after South-Indian taste, this is a place to be. They serve South Indian cuisine at very reasonable rate

Tried this restaurant based on various reviews but it was hopeless. Not recommended. Pathetic food. Do not waste your time.

Soooooo bagus!!! the last time i came here was when i was still a boy, with my mom. I didnt get the chance to finish my meal because its toooo big for me. But today i savoured not only the briyani but also the paper thosai and roti nan alone!!

We went here on a recommendation and after some initial confusion finding the right place (there seems to be a Kamala vegetarian restaurant on the main road too - so make sure you are on Buffalo Rd, about 150m from the Little India MRT station). We had lunch, both choosing the "rice set" - leaf plate, rice, four curries, dhal, various relish and sambal. Hot and good. Tried eating with my hands but made too much mess so resorted to a spoon I'm afraid. This place is an oasis of great food amongst the bustle of Little India - so different from the spick and span of downtown Singapore. Nice to see that Little India has resisted the sanitising that Chinatown has undergone in the last 20 years

We ordered number 202 the masala chicken platter for S$7.50. Plenty of food. Ate with our hands and they got stained from the spices. Or eyes watered and our noses ran but we had a great time. Washed hands in the sinks but the staying are still on our hands. Then we wanted to Mustafa Centre. A fun evening

I visited my sister who moved to Singapore recently with her husband and their son and we decided to go to little India for a meal. They have eaten here a few times and loved it. There are a lot of local people as well as tourists. We had a pushchair but this wasn't a problem. They are very accommodating. You choose what you want to eat, pay and then sit. I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it came on a tray, which had different sections and different dishes (see photo). As tourists we were given a fork and spoon however I wanted to do it like the locals... I used my hands to eat! You mix the liquid foods into the rice, pick up with your hands and eat! Once you have finished there is a sink where you can wash your hands. A great experience, great food and very friendly staff. Will definitely go back next time I am here ;-
