Stopped here for a bite to eat when sight seeing at Clarke Quay. Very quiet but we didn’t mind. Good service. Had a lovely Singapore sling which was freshly made. Not terribly hungry but enjoyed Patatas bravas and meatballs. All very tasty and hot.
5
Wanted to have a light dinner after Aperitif. This is the best place I found in my trip. I reccomend grilled squid and melon Jabom. The staff are excellent and the location is great with good ambiance.
3
First off the drinks were expensive... i had Octopus which was cooked to death!
The highlight though was the duo that were singing, they were superb!
The services was good, food mediocre especially for the price.
5
Food was great. Authentic spanish dishes. We love the paella. The churros was really good! Reminds me of the time when i stayed in ciudad real Spain. Atmosphere was great. My wife loves the river view while having dinner.
4
Went there a bit late and we were glad that we found the restaurant open. We ordered the Valenciana paella and it was very good. Tinto de verano was average. Nice view but a bit overpriced
4
Very pleasant bar next to the water. Situated adjacent to the bridge we visited a couple of times. Didn't eat here though plenty did and the main bar was very busy.
4
We almost didn't go in because ir looked closed from the outside. We ended up having a selection of tapas which were totally consistent with that I have eaten in Spain. Not cheap but nothing is in that area and the service charge adds up. However if you feel like Spanish food this is a good option.
4
Beautifully situated on the river at Clarke Quay, the tapas menu at this restaurant was exactly what we were looking for in a light lunch. Four dishes were more than enough to share - we enjoyed the patatas bravas, garlic prawns, Spanish tomato bread and sea bass with olives and dry sherry. The service was efficient but casual and friendly. We would certainly choose to come here again
3
It used to serve awesome Spanish food. The prawn Tapas and sea food Paella were some of the best I ate in Singapore. I used to go there almost every time I was in Singapore. But looks like its glory days are behind it. Now the food is reasonable without being delicious. There used to be another fantastic Spanish restaurant called Catalunya - pricey but superb - unfortunately, it has shut down.
5
We came here after seeing the Quay advertised on our hotels TV and came across this restaurant. Very quick service, we wanted to change one of the dishes in the set menu which was done without any fuss, would recommend the Singapore Sling & Chorizo with honey & red wine. Excellent food & drinks with a lovely view.
5
Great priced authentic tapas served in Clark quay.
Nice service and friendly staff serve here.
Great view of the quay and cool place to chill out and watch the world go by.
Recommended, nice for couples, business or family
5
What a life! Spend your time here while you listening to the music, enjoy the food, start from draught beer, mocktail, mojito, brocheta, calamari! Experience the beauty taste of spanish dish!
5
Dropped in here for a sort of late afternoon lunch / early dinner (could this be a lunner?) grabbed a few tapas and a couple of beers and glasses of Sangria. Currently doing a BOGOF deal between noon and 9.00pm.
3
Octapas is a long time classic by the river at Clarke Quay. Food is ok, as is service and atmosphere. Happy hour one for one.
3
I had dinner with family but the food did taste real spanish. It likes spanish food cooked by foreigner for foreigners. Price is also high
3
Service was nice and location good but the food was only mediocre. Better value elsewhere. Drinks were mid range
5
Having have tapas in various countries including Spain this is one of the best meals we've ever had. Highly recommended especially the prawns in garlic and olive oil to which we asked for chillies to be added making it a prawn pil pil. Happy hour also with buy one get one free.
1
Walked around Clark Quay and decided to grab some drinks. Chose this place because the location is nice.Service is average. Ordered a couple of margaritas. It was terrible! It tasted like water with a little bit of tequila and lime. So, I decided to try their strawberry margarita. I immediately regret my decision. Tasted like medicine.For 16SGD? Totally not worth it. I suggest you guys look for another place.Now, if you don't know your margaritas, then you might not mind having watered-down margaritas. But if you do, this place sucks
4
We initially went to this restaurant for happy hour drinks prior to moving on for dinner, we liked it so much that came back for more drinks after dinner. Located next to Read Street Pedestrian bridge over the Singapore River in Clarke Key. Like many of the restaurants along Clarke Key it has an indoor air-conditioned area and an outdoor terraced area right next to the river. Service was good, however the main plus for us was that by Clarke Key standards the beers were somewhat reasonably priced. It also had a lovely, but slightly separate, smoking area with proper restaurant tables right next to the river. We did not see any other restaurants / bars that catered for smokers so well
3
Called here early one evening attracted by the 2 for 1 drinks happy hour and fancied some tapas. We had the Valenciana paella for 2 at 42 dollars, good portion size, tasty, we stayed longer than the hour but the drinks remained half price, pleasant early evening experience on the quay side
1
We were there for having lunch. The plates are extremely little. The food was really not good and way too expensive. The service was friendly but the tables were unclean.
3
The restaurant is very nice decorated with very friendly staff. Riverside terrasse is very romantic and Clark Quay great touristic area.
About the food? If you been to Spain then you will know that it is just too expensive for a bad copy
5
Awesome food paired with excellent service. Position was decent. Good views by the river. Excellent service by Rajoob, attention to details and also Vie who kept coming to our table and check if everything is ok. Thumbs up to the both of you.
2
The tapas was okay, the sangria is watered down and not anywhere near what sangria should be. The paella was awful, prawns where white so were the mussels, tasted of nothing. Would not visit again.
2
We visited on the 8th of November 2017 during a 3 night stopover in Singapore.It looked ok and staff were very polite. We ordered Garlic Chicken and Chicken Paprika. The dishes were both very oily and chewy. The service was fine and no complaints with staff however the food was a real let down. We found better places on subsequent night
5
Soak in one of Singapore's hangout spot atmosphere and enjoy, Octapas has lots of option for food and drinks to choose from, the staff was great and helpful and hospitable. Keep it up guys!It's located in Clarke Quay restaurants and bars row, where people hangout and showcase their fashion taste
4
We had dinner here during their happy hour and shared four different tapas while we sat on a deck overlooking the Singapore River at Clarke Quay. It's a good spot for people watching, including those cruising the River. Our favourite tapas were the potatas bravas and cheese croquettes. The service was very good, with friendly and attentive staff
1
We ordered Melons with ibérico ham, the melons were sour and the bottom where the melon touches the plate has a sticky texture as though the melons had been all the plate and under the sun for an entire day, waiting to be served. Paella that took 30-40 minutes taste bland and overcooked. The worse we have ever had. The grilled octopus was a disappointment as well. Tortilla de espanola, a couple of omelette with potatoes and onion tasted like something you wouldn’t buy from 7eleven and it got tossed in the microwave and landed on our table.Can’t fault their red sangria which hits the spot. We just wanted a nice spot by the river but landed on a pirate ship and got robbed instead. Wouldn’t go back again.
4
We were looking for a quick bite to eat at midday and stopped here. To be honest I wasn't expecting too much of a Tapas restaurant in one of the main tourist areas of Singapore. Turned out to be very good and we will definitely return if we are back in Singapore. We had four tapas between two of us and we found that sufficient. If we were to be there in the evening for a main meal we would order more - possibly six.We had two chicken dishes, patata bravas, and what turned out to be our favourite - shrimps on toast. (It was probably prawns rather than shrimps but no matter it was very tasty!).All the tapas were well cooked and as good as similar dishes eaten in Spain
5
On our final evening in Singapore, we had dinner here. We thought the tapas were superb and my parents-in-law from the UK were massively impressed by the food! We had great service from the staff as well. They were friendly and courteous. Food did not take a century to arrive as well.We sat by the river and the view complements our meal greatly as well. I would go for a meal there again if we were in Singapore
4
Sitting outside, looking down at the river, enjoying good food and a cold beer. Nice range of tapas, in visually stunning setting. Service reasonable & friendly.
5
Very friendly stuff, out extra wish for pulpo al ajillo peperocino was well taken care off, the Seabass and gambas were fantastic - 5 stars , no questions tonight ! Thanks for a wonderful dinner experience !
3
Came here for dinner. Had very low expectation of this place as its in clarke quay, so obviously was expecing to pay high prices and tourist rip off area. The food was actually not bad, not the best tapas but definately not bad. Pricing was high for what it was , but expected given its location. Service was excellent. The band inside was very good, cocktails are mediocre. overall its not a bad place to come to have 1-2 tapas and a drink to watch the live band sing. ways to improve this place would be to lower the price, reducing the number of tapas items on the menu (its way too extensive), and instead focusing on more authentic spanish tapas choices
3
Nice setting at night overlooking water Great band playing inside around 9 or 10 pm. 1 for 1 happy hour for beer, wine, sangria and spirits. Overly red wine tasting sangria and more like fruity Cointreau drink than a Singapore sling, so not to our liking but quite possible others could like them? Beer cold so all good there! Tapas was ok. Nothing overly terrible but nothing that wowed. Came out pretty quickly. Staff friendly and attentive
5
Lots of hostesses, and menu boards, greet you as you walk along the Quay. We picked Octapas because their menu features suited our tastes. We had picked olives and artichokes, and cheese croquettes as a warm up, followed by Beef Tenderloin, Mussels, Scallops and Salmon. Of course we tried each others, and all were excellent. As well as outstanding views, we also enjoyed outstanding service. We interacted with 4 different staff, and all were friendly and professional. Try foe a 'selfie', and you will have staff at your table to take the picture for you before you can say 'cheese'
5
We were looking for somewhere to eat and Octapas caught our eye. Not wanting a big meal this looked like it would fit the bill.We ordered a selection of dishes, which arrived promptly, they were very tasty and eaten with relish. We dine in Spain quite regularly and Octapas was up to par
1
I'm so excited to have Spanish food here in Singapore, but the food here is really bad.... I ordered sangria (classic one) and also paella. They put too much ice cubes inside, so not much taste. The paella really let me feel disappointed, they don't know how to cook see food I think. Only the view and staffs are very nice
3
located in the heart of Clarke Quay you cannot miss the sounds of live music from this venue, as their band is just fantastic!! We came here because of them, and would definitely have gone back if we had more time. Really friendly, and great with the crowd. The beers were normal, but the food overpriced and of small quantity. But definitely go there if you're a lover of good music
3
We were staying at Swissotel, so walked to Clark Quay ( 5 minutes ), beautiful setting on the riverbank. Looked at several bars / restaurants, most were very busy and a little expensive, but it is such a great setting we wanted to stay and dine on the riverbank where you can watch the boats cruising up and down - very pretty with all the neon lights. Octapas was pretty much the only one left where we could get a table overlooking the river, so we sat down and ordered our food and drinks. Drinks were "2 for 1" until 8.00pm which helped make up for the food prices. Most of the tapas are only snack size and around $12 - $15.00 The drinks arrived promptly, but there was a long wait until the food arrived, and it was difficult to " flag down " a waiter / waitress to get a second drink. I tried the Bruschettas, nice flavours but small portions mean you need to order more food or desserts. Overall food and drinks were acceptable, service slow but staff were very busy with most tables full. But brilliant location/ setting makes it ok
2
Food was filled with a very very large amount of garlic. The cost of the meal didn't reflect the quality of the products presented to us. But we found a lot of singapore is very expensive for what you got. Would not go back. Some staff were very helpful. Others were quite rud
4
The location of this restaurant is good - right on the water at Clark Quay. Although touristy the food was good with lots of choice. It isn't cheap - but you are rewarded with the view and the people watching.
1
Poor quality of paela and 16$ for a draft beer! Wifi is slow.... when you are not disconnected !! The only good point is their situation. This place is only for stupid tourists...
4
Nice restaurant, food was tasty and service was quick with the food. At one point I had was kept waiting for 30 minutes to order a drink though but apart from that it was pretty good. Busy area so slots of people around.
1
We went there to have some drinks... Our cocktails (tequila sunrise & caipirinha) were totally overpriced, even for Singapore standards, very bad taste and almost no alcohol in them.
4
We stopped here for dessert after eating elsewhere and were not disappointed. Both varieties of churros were fresh, hot and amazingly tasty. Just what we were looking for!
1
Worse meal ever in Singapore. Terrible microwaved food for an exorbitant price. We paid 110$ for good that was not worth that price. Meatballs we dry and hard, clearly microwaved. The worse was the asparagus wrapped in ham. Burnt, dried and shrivelled - completely disgraceful. Can't imagine a chef who would be proud to serve that to his patrons. Clearly unqualified.What made matters worse was when we called the server over she had the audacity to tell us we were asking too much and asparagus at the restaurant has always been prepared that way. Throughout our meal she as rude and giving us quite an attitude.Don't waste your money. Stay away. Spend it on somewhere else that is worth your hard earned money
5
We ate here two nights as we wanted a light, tasty evening meal. The choice of tapas were very good and we were very happy with our choices. As we were there quite early the service was good. The restaurant got very busy later on. We finished our meal with a Creme Catalan and it was the best we have had outside Spain. We also took advantage of the happy hour offer, which seemed to last all night
2
I went there with some colleagues of mine because the bar is close to the Swissotel where we stayed in. The bar is in a very touristic place in the Clark Quay. Waiters are nice but the quality of the tapas is very weak I must say... and the price is very expensive on the other hand. If you decide to go there, just be prepared to experience the same as we did. At least now you know, it is your choice
3
We settled on this place and had a nice seat right on the water with a pretty view of the boat traffic. It may be because we have access to great tapas a home, but the food was just okay - mediocre. We ordered the patatas bravas, a jamón iberico and cheese sandwich, and a cheese dish, which was really just mozzerrella sticks.. They did have a 1 for 1 drink special, so that was a good deal. All in all it was about $70USD for two drinks and three tapas
2
Paella is very salty. We ask for lemon slices to lessen the saltiness but doesn't help. Musssels is not fresh. There is a tapas( can't rem the dish name) is a squid, overcooked. They having promo: 4 tapas ordered free one and 1-1 for some drinks. So in total we have 4 ppl and we ordered 4+1 tapas, drinks, one side dish and paella total ard $44 each.
5
My partner and I have visited octapas twice in the past week! The food is delicious and plenty of choice. We have sat indoors and outdoors, both have a nice ambience.
5
Yummy tapas, though very limited vegetarian options. Loved the egg potato omelette and chicken tapas.
3
Great location on the riverwalk, there was happy hour for both drinks and meals, I think it could be better but considering the location and proximity to the tourist trails although slightly expensive is was fine.
3
The service and location is really nice. The card I based on Spanish tapas, which is nice. I would like to have the possibility to sit outside and further there is a small gap between price and quality.
5
We walked all around Clarke Quay but settled on this place, which had a very interactive live band with a singer styled on Tina Turner, singing all sorts of songs.We didn't actually eat here but the cocktails were good and we even bumped into famous England Rugby player Mike Catt, who was touring with the Italian team. Never know who you might bump into...Great place for drinks in the eve
2
Good location and the band are great. We ordered 4 tapas and they got one wrong..gave us a salad we hadn't ordered. They did replace it with the correct item.The garlic prawns weren't hot so they took them away and eventually we got hot ones. But they were not great..dry and not very tasty. Perhaps they just reheated them...Patatas bravas very ordinary too. Pricey
4
Busy Friday night but welcomed as walk in diners by the restaurant and offered "happy hour" prices for drinks as well as an extra tapas item for every three items chosen - we chose 6 items = 8 tapas choices in all, at reasonable but not cheap prices. Great location, overlooking Singapore River
4
My husband and I reached Clarke Quay late at night after wandering around Singapore for hours. Because I was beyond exhausted and the heat was incredible, we stopped at one of the first places we saw at Clarke Quay - Octapas.We did indeed have Tapas, which was not bad, although we were suggested specials by the waitress and when we ordered the specials she said they weren't available...However, it was nice to sit by the river and listen to the extremely professional performers inside the restaurant, singing to well-known modern tunes, although it might have been too noisy inside
4
Firstly, you really can't beat the location - right on the water at Clark Quay. Tapas was nice and reasonably priced, probably not something I'd rave about though, and service was quick, attentive, and efficient. The highlight for me was the live band (I think they were called "Enigma"?) - overall, a fun night
4
This restaurant is in the Clarke Quay district surrounded by lots of other restaruants.We chose the seafood paella and it was served hot and was very tasty. The waitress told us that it may take a while to cook we also ordered some croquets which were also very tasty. We finished off with a churros which was also well cooked and presented. Beer and sangari's were classified as happy hour drinks and so were reduced in price. Overall we enjoyed the food, service and location of this restaurant and all for a very reasonable price
4
a very nice place for a shared family meal and drinks. our first dinner in singapore and was located right next to our hotel. inexpensive and specials on sangria and spanish beers made for an inexpensive and filling meal.
1
...and it really was.
Its nicely situated, but don't be lured by this. The food is ordinary and the portions very small. the prices - of course, sky high even for Singapore. Service incompetent and unfriendly. Skip it.
3
Great view from outside but the worst Pina Colada I've ever had and the pan seared Scollops were very ordinary.
5
I love this amazing Spanish restaurant. They serve the best mushroom tapas. Fill w herbs n olive oil. Very healthy. There is a promotion of buy 3 tapas, get 1 free.
5
Saturday of the Sing Sevens we found this place as an easy option to pock over the food as we picked over the day's rugby. Pleasant staff. Good mix of tapas for all pallets.We had about 9 dishes for three of us which was ample.Great location on Quay. Watch the world go by
3
Went looking forward to a nice Tapas meal having been in Asia for awhile. One salad, bread basket (toasted that went solid quickly), chorizo, churros and a large bottle of sparkling water for one came to $65 including service charge and GST- extortionate!! Also service was slow and impolite. Had it not been on the water front and on the busy bar scene I wouldn't have gone. Such a shame
5
We stumbled upon this restaurant as we strolled along Clarke quay trying different bars & ended up staying all night.The live band are fantastic & really got the crowd inside going - the atmosphere was great with a mixture of countries and ages and the dance floor was full. The food was delicious & as a vegetarian there was plenty of choice for me. Table service meant we didn't need to keep going to the bar for drinks, it was a little slow but we didn't mind a gentle prompt, reminded the staff and given it was really busy it was as expected. A great night out with fantastic music & lovely tapas.
5
Personally, i love the food. The mushrooms and prawns sauteed in garlic is THE BEST. Keeps me coming back for more. Too bad for those who find it too pricey. I think the price is quite okay, especially if youre having dinner and the band is playing. Makes it more worth your money. The desserts are not bad. Churros and Red Velvet Lava Cake.The band is incredible. I promise you they are very entertaining. Very welcoming too. Acknowledge every customers who watches them. They play our requests too. Might get a little loud so if youre looking to have a romantic dinner but still wanna enjoy the music, can maybe sit by the river (they have seatings outside too) or sit indoor but right at the back
3
Went here for dinner. Situated in Clarke Quay with seating along the riverside. Our table was broken. Menu was ok but not a great variation, also quite pricey. Food was ok only and portions small even for tapas. Wine list was sparse and poor quality. Service very average. Wouldn't go back
3
Been here previously and disappointed this time. Was warmly welcomed and seated by the river by friendly waiter. Firstly, calamari arrived instead of shrimps in garlic which I ordered ( from different waiter & he suggested I accept but I did request he change for the shrimps). Potatoes were swimming in oil. Chicken wings dry and tasteless. Spinach was just okay- same texture as frozen variety. Expensive for the quality but position is good
4
Food were generally good. However the cocktail (Singapore Sling) was mediocre. Service staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
4
Special deals made this a very reasonably priced meal. The food was delicious and the staff were very polite and friendly, all of which made for a most enjoyable meal.
3
Fairly promising menu. Good location with seating above the river. The quantity of food delivered for the price was less satisfactory however.
2
Visited here for a dinner with another family with kids. This was pricey spot on Clarke Quay. Lication is nice, but the price did not meet up with the food. Portions were small, like typically tapas restaurants might have, but price comparable to normal size dishes. Furthermore the food was not very tasty, average to mediocre for most of the plates we ordered.The staff was mostly friendly and attentive, but they missed to bring two drinks we ordered and we had to remind them.There are many other places around that would offer better value for money and tastier food. I would not waste my time with this place
4
I had a look at the menu here and saw some of the food being delivered to the tables thought it rather expensive for what were quite small dishes. I know that's what tapas is, but surely, the purposes of smaller dishes is to give you a great chance of different flavours and experiences at a reasonable price. Anyway, I decided to have a beer and watch the world go by - something the staff are happy or you to do - so no pressure about using up a dining table. The people who dealt with me were delightful, polite staff and made me feel relaxed. The beer price - well $10S for a pint was good when compared with nearby places, but for some reason all alcohol is more expensive here. The Clarkes Quay is a tourist type place with every bar having very similar, rather sterile concrete architecture. I can't imagine how wonderful it must have been before all the re-development
2
My wife and I went for dinner at Octapas as it looked and smelt great. The restaurant was not packed, though enough people. The wait staff gave little attention, all looking like they just want to finish their shift. We ordered a jug of Sangria which was too watered down to the point I had to ask is there any alcohol in it? We ordered the combination paella which took far too long even for paella to cook, when we asked how much longer it will be the wait staff would say we will find out and just did not come back to us. When the paella did arrive it was pathetically small, I am saying a pan the size of an average dinner plate and no more than 15 mm deep, even though the menu said for two and the wait staff said all their dishes are large. In all the taste was good however the value did not reflect the quantity and quality of food, we left unsatisfied. Singapore has a one of the most competitive food standards in the world; we could not understand why Octapas did not see this. Make another choice if you are hungry or just want a decent size meal
4
Glad we arrived in time for one drink on their happy hour menu and were able to partake in buy 3 tapas get one free. Wish staff had told us in the beginning that there were only 3 tapas that could be ordered as the "free" dish. Luckily we liked two of the dishes we were forced to order for our "free" dishes. The sea bass with a light cheese sauce was very good. We were less impressed with the "toasts" which appeared to have been pre-made as they were very soggy under the toppings
3
Octapas is a nice enough option to eat by the side of the River in the Clarke Quay, about 15 mts walk from Marina bay and sandwiched amongst the many other eating options in the area.The food and menu really is not bad - but for me it has to be somehow extra special as tapas to get a very good rating - I find it a touch expensive for the size of the tapas style portions and somehow the menu does not convey the point of eating tapas - lots of small things at friendly prices rather than one big meal.I liked it, but did not feel special...
4
Octapas is in a good location situated right by the river. We enjoyed alfresco dining at night, and the location was buzzing with night life. The staff was friendly and attentive. There were plenty of tapas to choose from the menu. I recommend trying one of their sangrias
5
We visited here for lunch & had the promotion of three tapas & get one free. As I have coeliac it can be a problem when eating out but here they had gluten free options & although the free tapas was not gluten free the chef came out to ask if he could change it for me so I had sea bass in lemon which was really good. Very helpful staff & chef Would recommend for gluten free & my husband & friends enjoyed there meals too.They also serve alcohol & soft drinks
5
Highly recommend this place. Service fantastic, food great and reasonably priced. Would go there again in a heartbeat.
5
Little gem of a place right on the river at clarke quay .fantastic food lovely helpful staff and nice buzz about the place .good offers for tea time specials and reasonably priced.
5
Delicious food heaps of options to choose from all reasonably priced looking over the river! The croquettes were amazing! Will be back!!
2
Rude customer service! Was waiting for my friends and they forced me to buy on the spot or else have to leave. What sort of happy hour would it be without drinking with my friends? Too much money minded!Food was average, not to my liking, but drinks were average priced and I liked their bartending. All the cocktails were on point for us. Pity the live band, I think it's called Sounds of Enigma, to be playing in such a lousy environment. Small stage noisy speakers. BUT WONDERFUL band! Makes my day! Was my reunion with Army Friends so they special played our favourite songs! Got some of us dancing to the beat! Had so much fun but the restaurant ruined it
2
Had tapas at lots of other places before. Here they felt like bad copy attempts. Had the anchovies and they looked and tasted like dropped straight out of the can and drenched in vinegar and lemon. Too bitter. And it didn't even come a single slice of bread. Just a tiny plate with a dozen anchovies deeply submerged in oil and vinegar. Then we ordered the a portion if grilled bread separately to try and mop it down easier. Bread was hardly grilled at all. Looked more like heated quickly a very light and fast grilling. Flaky bread too. Didn't taste much like bread at all. Also had the grilled octopus. It was rubbery. Tasted like it it had been overcooked and it didn't have much favour. Even Australian Fremantle pickled octopus has 10 times more flavour. The grilled was the dish that was ok. But almost $90 for the experience above? Absolute waste. Food halls in Orchard Road would leave Octapas dishes in shame
4
Food places along this section are virtually door to door and it is difficult to make up one's mind on where to eat but this venue was a very good choice. Of course when in Singapore one must remember that all prices on a menu are shown without a service charge or GST which amounts to 17% and quickly boosts the end total.Tiger pints were a good buy, and we thoroughly enjoyed our choice of Pancetta Pork Belly and Coconut Prawns wrapped in Bacon followed by a Red Velvet Lava Cake. Good service
2
The restaurant looked good & the sangria was great. There was 6 of us & we shared tapas which were nice. We then shared The paella, one meat & one seafood. The next day we caught a plane to Khao Lak for the next part of our journey. By the time we arrived 3 of our party was very sick, vomiting& diarrhoea. For the next 3 days they were mostly confined to bed with shocking food poisoning symptoms. Ruined part of the holiday
5
I'd been here for dinner and loved it. For a quiet non booze lunch it was better.Staff relaxed. Atmosphere relaxed. Me relaxed.Prawn skewers were delicious. Pork belly was fantastic (so I'm told) and polo croquetas well received.Sitting here indoors on a cold and frosty UK morning - the memories are flooding back - and very happy they are too.Loved it
5
We had red wine and one of their set menus - about 5 different items. Every item except one was uniformly excellent. Especially loved the chorizo and potato dish. There was one issue with half of one dish. And when I mentioned it - their response was instant and professional. They gave me a free desert and took a couple of glasses of wine off of our bill. I think they didn't remove that item because it was part of a set menu.I will note that I did NOT request any of that. I was simply, as a matter of courtesy, informing them of an issue (lamb skewer was kind of tough and not really worth eating), and they sprang into action. So polite and so professional. I would go back there any time without hesitation. The female maitre D and our waitress - so great!And by the way - I did go back the next night and the two items ordered were again delicious
4
We wanted to have dinner on the Singapore River but, being the start of the monsoon season, had to wait several days to get a clear night. The Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and Robertson Quay area abound with restaurants. We chose Octopas because of its central location on the river and a desire to have good Spanish tapas. The mojitos were excellent and the food very tasty. We elected to try the house special cocktail but found it too sweet. The restaurant were happy to replace it with another mojito. The atmosphere for the outside seating on the river is colourful and slightly exotic and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinne
5
Great night out dancing. Thank you for the live music. Sangrias was very good. Red one is my favorite. We wanted to pub crawl but when the band started playing we decided to stay because of the ambience.
5
Staff were brilliant and were attentive and friendly. Food was great! Definitely highly recommended!
3
I was hoping for a great relaxing and festive dinner, but I got mediocre food and poor service. The servers have no idea of Spanish food and all they know is pushing customers for the specials. Most unprofessional if not annoying.
1
This was such a disappointment from start to finish.The four of us had each ordered a different sangria. Each one was watered down and really didn't have the appropriate fruit in them. It appeared as if it was more flavoring that was added. We also ordered about 5 different tapas dishes to share, of which one was paella. All the dishes but the paella were lukewarm at best. The paella itself was presented in a hot cast iron pan with foil on top, as if it came straight from the fridge to the oven rather than cooked fresh over a gas stove. The food even tasted a bit plastic like as if it wasn't fresh but had that leftover texture to it.The place has indoor and outdoor seating with live band. Indoor is a bit stuffy so we moved outside to get a bit of the breeze off the water as well as from the fans
3
We had a light supper on New Year’s Eve – busy but found a table for 2 overlooking river – 3 tapas – prawns in bacon – not a winning combination – mushrooms with cheese and what appeared like spinach – under seasoned – breaded chicken fingers with a dip – hot and crunchy but dip indifferent – service speedy – met the brief but no more – thank yo

I went there with my friends in new year's eve. We ordered cocktails, mocktails, tapas, and churros.The mocktails is average, and the cocktails is not so good because they put not much alcohol. The tapas size is only 150gr of pork meat, which is very small size even for 1 person and the meat is also overcooked. The churros is the only delicious one. They served it with vannilla ice cream and chocolate syrup, churros also taste good and crunchy.Overall its nice place to hangouts with friends just for drinks and snacks :) while having chat, people can enjoy the nice view to the river

Average quality of ingredients. I strongly doubt there's anybody Spanish working in the kitchen or even doing one basic monthly training only. Overpriced for what we got. Salad of manchego floating in vinegar, left untouched but not removed from the bill.Hostess seeming bored and uninterested while the two Indian (?) descendants waiters have been polite and pretty attentive indeed. Won't come back unfortunately.....

We dined at the waters edge on 2 evenings, over looking the Clarke Quay busy waterway lit up with lights and water taxis and cruisers. Relaxing and tranquil after busy days sightseeing. We enjoyed a variety of Spanish tapas and chose some of the attentive staff recommendations. Clean, efficient, and not crammed. Choice of indoor dining or deck at waterside. The atmosphere here at Clarke Quay is fantastic and comes alive of an evening, with musos and bands playing at eateries and even wandering along the waterside!! Place to be!
2
Well this restaurant at Clarke Quay was a huge disappointment. The drinks were priced 20 dollars up and were no good. We ordered a sangria and a Singapore flyer and the a chicken appetizer. They had only one chicken option in the menu so not much to choose from. The drinks were no good and the appetizer portion was a joke for the price. I found this place a total rip-off. Nothing to offer besides the view of the Singapore river and skyline which is visible from by the pier as well for no price at all. Avoid

The band, Enigma, that plays here are not only brilliant but very engaging. They try and make everyone feel special. last night there were half a dozen 20 something girls and a very elderly couple from Israel, all made to feel at home. The lady lead singer has a very powerful smooth voice and entertains by dancing if the male lead takes over. My favorites by this band are Smooth, by Santana & Hotel California - great cover versions. But the cover Abba, Queen etc with equal aplombMy friend and I share a lovely bottle of Rioja whilst enjoying 3 sets from this group.It's become a weekly indulgence now. They play 6 days a week from 9.30 pm - If you like a lively, fun band who act as if you are their only customer, then you must check them out
4
Love the grilled squid and seafood paella. Will definitely come again with family and kids. Great environment too!
5
1 staff Shanky which really shows what customer service really is like and also a great asset to the company. Awesome!! Awesome!!
4
great location on clarke quay so you can sit outside and sink in the atmosphere by the river. the food was really good. service was not bad but could have been slightly better as i kept having to ask for water
3
Staff were friendly but the speed of service was rubbish; so slow.
Excellent choice of dishes to choose from, but all came out in dribs and drabs. The bread arrived ten minutes after everything else.
Probvably better to go in the evening rather than lunctime
2
We have come to this place whenever we visit Clark Quay. Sad to say the quality and service have dropped greatly. this is not at best a mediocre tapas restaurant. The staff are not attentive or engaging forgetting orders. The sangria was color and flavor water. Lastly the price is definitely gone up from our last visit. I will not recommend this if you want value for money or good quality food
4
Visited here last nice and really enjoyed good food and good service. We had Spanish ommlette, stuffed mushrooms, patas bravas and tomato bread. All the food was delicious and the service was also good. There was some entertainment playing inside which was also reasonable. Would definitely visit here again if in Singapore. Good location
3
Went for work function and we booked a large outdoor section for our group. It was a buffet style arrangement with a limited selection, largely not really tapas. Most of the dishes were average to say the least. The service was good though and the staff really looked after us. Would suggest to try somewhere else
2
Very disappointing. Poor front of house staff. No real engagement, dropping plates on the table rather than serving our food. Not good enough, the two guys who covered our table really need to be retrained and taught the basics in customer service. Until they improve I would give this place a miss. There is plenty of choice in Clarke's Quay
5
Had heard there were a lot of places to eat at Clarke Quay so took a taxi from my hotel. It was a beautiful warm dry evening and this restaurant had tables next to the river. There were 5 in my group and we ended up ordering 6 tapas dishes, all delicious. One of my group was gluten intolerant but there were plenty of dishes she could choose from. Plenty of wait staff around and the food didn't take long to arrive. A great evening out
2
I love good tapas, made with love. This is not the place to have those. It is possible this place is more for drinks. We chose 5-6 different tapas for a lunch, and of all the meals during 4 days in Singapore, this was the last in our list. No heart in it. Overcooked or prepared too early/quickly. And expensive, especially when the quality of food was so poor. Would not go again
5
This restaurant is located in Clarke Quay, Great place, good food, fast and efficient service, give it a go you won't be disappointed.
4
Nice restaurant in a good location
We ordered a "tabla de queso" as starter and "paella de carne" as main dish, not too bad but to be improved (for spanish taste)
Price in average or a little bit lower for this area of Singapore
3
Then again, good luck finding a place in Clark Quay which is none of the abovet...
It is one of a dozen places to start the evening, the staff were nice, but other than that no lasting memories.
3
Can't remember much about the food, other than it was pretty average. The table overlooked the Singapore river, and there weren't many people there. The service was good. Had better experiences at other restaurants in the area.
4
Octopus tapa is ok. Sort of has the aquarium taste. Atmosphere is great and drinks are good as well Nice view alomg the riverfront
4
Went for drinks with a group of friends. Had 2-3 rounds here before going on to eat elsewhere. Sitting outside chatting and enjoying the atmosphere. Staff quick to check if we wanted top-ups. Good start to the evening.
4
My first visit at Octapas was 2 years back and I had a warm reception by the staff and the food was great! My family visiting from Australia loved the food and the band. Two years later on my second visit, I tried new dishes they had added in their menu. Even my 2 year old loved the food! The best part of the whole experience was the staff in particular Gaz and Joy. They would always make sure that your needs are attended too and very friendly. Definitely a great place and atmosphere to hang out with your buddies or family even
1
I dont think words can express how terrible was our experience in this restaurant. We went there for a late lunch and, with all the respect, seamed that a waiter did our food. To start we had a deep fried calamari that was full of oil and had no taste at all. The paella was so bad i couldnt describe. It was burned and had 3 shirmps. When we pay lot of money for good food it'S nice to spend it, when we pay lot of money for bad food it's better To be hungry. There is a lot of nice places To Eat in clarke quay, you do not need To go To This place.
4
Another recommendation by my Hubby - great location in Clarke Quay. There are 3 areas to this tapas bar - inside and 2 outside by the river - a bar area and the restaurant. Sitting by the river is lovely, especially if you get a table right by it - not only can you watch the world go by but you get a welcoming breeze off the water on the balmy Singaporean nights!The tapas menu is varied, with many traditional/favourite dishes available with a few which I would term Asian inspired. On our visit we had the Patatas Bravas, Champinones Al Ajillo, Quesos Espanoles, Lubina en Salsa Verde, Pancetta con Chimicurri, Albondigas Con Salsa & Solomillo De Ternera - between two! Having eaten all that we were pleasantly full as the portions were just the right size. Every dish was delicious and well presented.Drinks wise we had 2 cocktails and 2 soft drinks.Total; bill was just under $200 - might sound a lot BUT given what we had it wasn't actually that bad (for Singapore!)It was well recommended and I would most definitely go back
5
On our last day in Singapore we decided to visit Clarke Quay. As we knew that was a party place mostly in night hours, but we didn't expect it will be so quite at 2.30-3 p.m.! We were hungry, but still managed to find an opened restaurant. It was not easy. One of them (out of 2) was Octapas. Need to say, acceptable prices and happy hours took their toll and there also was nice smiling waiter named Sunil, who tried to serve us as best as he can & succeed. We enjoyed our lunch at so famous place near the river. The food was amazing, no chili-crab unfortunately, but still a lot of delicious sea food & cold draft Tiger beer just as I requested
4
Octapas was a nice restaurant, next to the river. Live music at night , it's great there. Food was good , drink was nice. A little bit pricey but you know Singapore anyway. I sat by the riverside, nice view.
2
We had 4 plates of tapas, a beer and tap water. The flavor was almost nonexistent and we really like Spanish food. We paid around £56 which was expensive for what we had. Not recommendable at all.
4
Good value but could increase their pasta offerings . Good was delicious though so no real complaints
3
Tasty food and a good location in Clarke Quay. The menu choices are standard however the taste doesn't let you down. Get a table by the waters edge to make the evening.
4
Enjoyed some lovely Tapas here, including Escargots, prawns, mushrooms which all brilliant. Include this with great service and a view over the Clarke Quay and watching the passing parade this place is fantastic. Will be back for sure next time we are in Singapore.
2
Very poor service. Waited 20 mins for a drink. Checked out the menu, but server never returned to take an order. Had first drink and asked for the check.
2
the food was strictly passable. iberico ham was flavourless and the portions were miserly. paella was decent. the crowning disappointment was being charged S$60 for a bottle of wine when in the actual order was for 2 glasses = S$30. that said the ambience is decent - typical Clarke quay! and the staff is friendly and service prompt
5
really enjoyed the whitebait and beef tenderloin cubes recommended by the manager, Ghaz.They have indoor area for some who enjoy great music and dancing, not forgetting the outdoor area if you are looking for a place to just chill by the singapore river. Friendly staffs too
4
We ordered six tapas for the two of us, and had trouble finishing with elderly appetites, but the food was so good we would have wasted none. The venue at Clarke Quay on the Singapore River, following a river cruise, as the sun went down, is what holiday memories are made of. Table service was a bit haphazard and the bill a bit steep, but by that stage we didn't care
5
my girlfriends & i went to octapas last friday for dinner and drinks, and we love the place! we had a few of their popular dishes & signature drink recommended by the manager, ghaz. love the band, the ambience while seated by the river & the staffs were all super friendly and attentive. just what we need after a work week- to just unwind & relax. we would definitely go back again
4
My partner and I visited in July. We ordered the muscles and seafood paella. Food was good. Service was equally as good. Nothing out of the ordinary, a good meal during our time in Singapore.
3
Food aren't up to expectation. Fideau isn't taste good as what I expected. Using too much frozen ingredient. Service staff do have bad body odour smell. Environment is good. Seating are too close to each others.
4
Friendly atmosphere and service. Had lunch rather than visiting in busy after six time. Generous serves for tapas. May be different in busy times.
3
The food was average, service was average but most of all you couldn't get fresh bread to soak up the sauces. They wanted to give us grill baguettes slices. The only reason for this is they are using stale bread. Give it a miss.
4
Good place to sit and relax while in Singapore. Foods are good ( not so great ) and staff are very attentive. Overall good experience. Prices seem high but it is quite common for all outlets in Clarke Quay.
3
The food was awesome, but not enough. Understand tapas, but when the dish was $22 and under main menu, I expected more than three scallops. Don't get me wrong, they were excellent, as was the lamb...we just left almost as hungry as we arrived. They did have the prettiest waitress I have seen in quite a long time
5
I and my friends decided to treat ourselves with a night out party and ended up in this bar restaurant. We passed by this restaurant and got attracted with their halfprice happy hour till 9pm.(what a save of money). but the most amazing part of our night is when the band play( the antidote). they are really good/talented and very friendly.I highly recommend this place if you want to chill and relax.
3
Tapas are average, paella could be better. Generous ingredients within however, good for 2-3 persons. Live band starts at 9.30pm which is probably the attraction. Wine was ok, decently priced. Service could be better, was difficult to get someone to serve you, and they do not even refill your water
1
We had dinner at octapas last night, being from Spain I thought we should try tapas. What a terrible experience!! we ordered the tabla and the tortilla, the tabla was $45.00 Singapore dollars and all we got was chorizo that must of been cut days ago, no taste and looked off !! A couple of olives and some fatty salami, visually the food looked like it was prepared days ago.. It looked nothing like the the pic on the menu and tasted old.. The tortillas were these small quiches that looked microwaved.. Soooo Disapointed!!! We did tell both the waiter and the girl in the entrance and all we got was Sorry!!! Not good enough!!! Pick up your game! people don't want to be served that quality of food.
4
Good food, good service for Singapore! Great location! A good place to take colleagues that doesn't break the works budget and has food to suit everyone's taste. It also won't embarrass you with poor service like many other places do. It gives colleagues an opportunity to see more of partying singapore if they wish.
5
We enjoyed the service and the food.
We ordered the meat Paella for two, the batata brava, and the garlic mushrooms.
Very reasonable prices consider the most tourist area in Singapore.
3
Food was quite tasty and location is nice. Service was slightly odd, since there were no Spaniards anywhere - trying to have the people understand that I would order little and often was a struggle! That being said it was a pleasant evening.
5
This was a pleasant find beside The Singapore River in Clarke Quay. Spanish and excellent tapas and good selection.
5
Good experience overall . Just no bread served and usually enjoy tapas with that . Went with 2 friends. Nice ambience and quite romantic. Good live music after 9 pm too
4
Sangria and a wide variety of tapas, right by the river, makes for a very pleasant meal. Take advantage of the Happy Hour deals.
5
Love the share plates. Everything was very tasty. There is outdoor seating right at the river edge as well as indoor seating. We were there at lunch during the week so it wasn't crowded. It would be fun to experience in the evening as they have a live band. Great location at Clarke Qua
1
Very bad experience. The tapas is very bad quality and it is pricey. Spent over S$180 for 3 and just beer with happy hours. The food is stale and not tasty. Served by Bangladeshi or India waiters who have been trained poorly. Please don't try this and regret
2
Staff tried to take the Paella dish away after I already said I hadn't finished. Had to tell him twice. Pen didn't work when signing the credit card slip. Waiter came with another pen and threw it down on the signing pad. Another staff was better and more sensitive to us. Food was fine. This was my second visit. Not sure if I'll come again as didn't feel welcome this time.
5
Very pleasant evening with a friend and colleague eating tapas, drinking wine/beer and talking ... that word that rhymes with grit.great spot. Clarke Quay busy but with a table near the water - it feels quiet.Food was good. Not expensive for the amount we got through! Recommended
4
I had an excellent collection of tapas and drinks here on a recent visit to Singapore along with a group of friends. Service was very polite and helpful and the range of dishes on the menu authentically Spanish. Quality was very good - often I find European food very disappointing in Asia but of course in Singapore they usually get it spot on and they certainly do here
5
Restaurant is next to the river and have nice verity of small dishes which you can eat together. This for small groups or even for two people a nice thing to spent the time during dinner.
3
Friday night with the ladies, spend about $200, food was ok, service was passable.
Not the very best experience to start our party.
4
Ideal to relax, have a drink and some good food while enjoying the great view of the Singaporean river bank. Small portions though. But great flavors.
4
Very good service – and fast reaction when the rain all of a sudden was pouring down. Nice food. Good quality and value for your money. Actually quite cheap compared to their neighbors.
4
Just had late brunch--- grilled squid, sea bass, beef and chicken skewers, minted lamb chops.... All very good... Happy hour so 4 glasses wine and 4 vodka 7 up for half price :)
1
We visited here while staying in Singapore for a few nights. We ordered a few tapas dishes and majority came out cold. We sent them back and asked for hot ones. Chorizo was like hot dog sausages. Wouldn't return.
5
I visited ur bar & was very happy with the food & service providedGuys @ the bar was very hospitable & friendly By the name of Mangesh.We ordered garlic beef and Paella valenciana which had a great taste @ aroma Great food Keep upTnx
2
Well, it is on the rivet and despite the competition they must do a business. Bit not from me again. Just so,so. The lamb had been pre cooked and the sauce was added before serving. I have seen this done before and I am not impressed. Spanish in Singapore is hat it is
2
Came here for a birthday dinner for 4 people on a Wednesday night. Having been dining in Singapore for a week this was the worst service we received at any of the restaurant/cafes we dined at.The bad. Service was terrible. Staff seemed to be running all over the place without organisation. The waiter who took our order didn't write the order down and this is always a recipe for disaster when four people are dining in my opinion which was soon proved right. Drinks did come out reasonable quickly and so did the first couple of dishes. However after a wait of after 45 minutes none of the other dishes had arrived. So had to grab a waiter who went to see what was going on. He did come back after around 5 minutes with a dish we hadn't ordered so we had to explain what we ordered, what had arrived and what hadn't. After around 15 minutes the rest of the order came out. Further drink ordering was also spotty as some drinls came out quickly and some took ages.The good. Well the food was ok. Some dishes were better than others but overall we were satified with the food when it arrived
4
Was there with my wife for a drink. We didn't have dinner. The band was really good and this is the major reason why we stop at Octapas. We love the band. Each time they stop for a break people are leaving. Once they start back, crowd arrive. They really attract the costumers. This is the value added of the place. Well done guys. We enjoyed our evening with you
4
Always enjoyed my evenings here. Friendly staff. Tapas at sensible prices and either river or street view for outdoor dining is fun. Wandered indoors after dining to enjoy atmosphere and group playing. Great evening. Professional manager.
5
We went to Clarke Quay looking for some good food and found it at Octapas the paella was awesome first time I have ever tried it wont be the last.
2
Don't expect on food too much. We ordered main dish of Octopus and Pork, the dishes look cheaper and tasteless. Good place just to enjoy outside and atmosphere. 雰囲気だけです。食事には期待しないように。サービスチャージが10%含まれてますが、カード精算にtip欄あり。ご注意あれ！ビールも値段高過ぎ！
4
Food was very tasty but a little too much olive oil. Service was good. Don't go expecting to rush. Pace is very Mediterranean. Dishes came one by one. Nice setting and a pleasant experience
2
We came to this place on a Saturday night around 9pm. We were super hungry from a long day, and this place had decent reviews so we thought we'd try. First off, don't come here if you want to be able to talk to your friends. There was a live performer and the music was so loud you had to scream at the waiter, and we literally could not hold a conversation. Also worth noting is this place is really small. Secondly, we waited 10 minutes then had to get up to ask someone to take our drink order. 20 minutes later, we get our drinks and place our food order. At that point we weren't expecting much of the food, and they didn't disappoint. Another 25 minutes later our overpriced small tapas plates came out, one of my coworkers plates was cold. Just a really disappointing experience. Maybe they were having an off day - but you've been forewarned
3
Among the many nice Clarke Quay restaurants we picked Octapas because we wanted some nice Spanish style food. Let's get the positive stuff first: The food is quite good - as long as you remember that the portion sizes follow the Tapas principle. You need at least a couple, even if you are not a big fellow. We tried three different ones, and the were all ok. Then the fun part - and that's if you are inclined to take incompetence as fun... The waiter must have been on his first day... Tell me, he was... and his last too, I would hope. We ordered TWO glasses of white wine. He came with TWO, left us one of them and quickly disappeared. We got one more after a gentle prod of course. We ordered food (no assistance from the waiter on the tapas-concept, so we ordered one dish each). Then we enjoyed the wine and talked for about an hour until we were a bit hungry. When asking about the food, it became clear that the order had been lost somehow. Well, we got it in five min from there, and it was good - and small. We had to order TWO more glasses of wine, which took us through quite a conversation with the waiter, who couldn't really understand why TWO people would want TWO glasses of wine... With a few more hick-ups we got some more food too - and generally enjoyed the meal. Had we been busy or had we had a tiring day, we might have enjoyed the show a bit less:
3
We are experienced tapas eaters and didn't want too much too eat so we thought we'd try it. Most of the Spanish names were not there but descriptions were eg fried potatoes in tomato sauce we knew to be patatas bravas. The food was reasonably authentic but a little pricey. It all arrived together which is unusual for tapas. However, after that the service was shambolic at best. I lost count of the number of waiters who asked us things so much so the dessert arrived half an hour after ordering it and after the bill where it was itemised! It seems to me that it needs a strong hand at the helm to direct the staff rather them all trying to do everything and achieving very little
4
It took a while for someone to take our order, but that can be the norm in Singapore. Once we finally did speak to a server, we relaxed with our drinks and enjoyed our seats by the water. I normally don't enjoy eating outdoors in Singapore, but the evening wasn't too hot and our table was next to a group of electric fans, so I was comfortable. It was happy hour, so our beers were "one for one." Though we enjoyed the breeze and people-watching, we had now been there over thirty minutes without our food. We flagged down a waiter, and it was explained that our order got "lost" in the kitchen, and please accept their apologies for the inconvenience. Further, we were told our drinks would be taken off the bill. Our food came about ten minutes later. . .first the marinated olives (simple, but really tasty with our beers!) and then the other three dishes arrived at the same time. We had toast points with roasted vegetables/garlic/parmesan(?) which were simple but tasty. We both loved the seared scallops drizzled with a cilantro sauce. The pork loin slices had a wonderful sauce (port?) with caramelized onions and roasted peppers. Also beautifully presented. Not very tender, but the taste was great. And the sangria was decent. (I very much dislike sweet sangrias and skeptical to order in restaurants, but virtually every table had ordered them so we thought we'd give it a try. Pretty good! The taste was fruity didn't go down a sticky-sweet punch.)I'm excited to go back soon
4
They have a good selection of fresh sea food and presented and cooked deliciously. Amazing experience. The wine was awesome too.The staff was courteous and very prompt to bring water on the table which generally most of the Singapore hotels lag behind.Located at buzzling clarke quay this is a place worth visi
1
visited this establishment in late December on a stop over to Australia, we were a party of 5 people, we were shown to our seats by a very scruffy member of staff who eventually came back to take a drinks order, we ordered some water and a bottle of red wine , he proceeded to pour the wine which spilled onto my wife`s hand bag, I informed him of what he was doing as he didn't notice, he then proceeded to wipe the wine off the bag with his hand, at this stage I stopped him and told him to go and get napkins too clean the mess, this was the start of what only can be described as a complete fiasco, the food came and the portions were a joke the food was cold and the prices did not reflect the poor quality of the food and the standard of service, I passed my comments to the duty manager but my honest impression was she wasn't interested, because of the busy tourist location they weren't interested in quality of food or service just simply to take your money, this always saddens me as a customer when it is so much easier to offer good service and a decent quality of food represents some value for mone
3
Decent tapes food and good service. Nothing special, but good all the same. Children enjoyed the Churros live music on too aw we were there.
4
Great tapas restaurant in a great location in the middle of Singapore. Some really excellent food choices. Reasonable value. Drinks expensive but on the whole on a par with the rest of the city. A good night out for sure.
4
A great place and great live music! I had a great and relaxing night. Definitely worth a visit for chilling with friends as the place is comfortable for chitchat.
4
We were a party of 6, came to Clarke Quay to finish off a night out. Chose this because it did NOT have loud music outside (there was a live band inside).
Very nice service.
4
I always love paella and when I came and visit Octapas, bring me back to my trip to Spain, Valencia, seafood paella bring back my joy.
4
Spanish style tapas were great. Missing variety of vegetable and starch based tapas. Lots of meat and sauce options. Very flavorful food.
2
The location is good but the price is overly expensive.We ordered just 5 tapas for the 2 of us and we felt we were cheated, we pay 90sgd just drinking a coke and the 5 tapas, the food is good but really expensive!I'm pretty sure there is plenty of better options around Singapore, even for spanish food
4
The food and the wine here were very good and the service wasn't bad either on a Saturday afternoon around 3 or 4 pm. The table itself didn't seem very clean but it was right next to the River so the view was great. We ordered sauteed mushrooms (with brandy and garlic) to go with our wine and those were very delicious. The wine was like what we drank last summer in Spain so we accompanied it with a bit of reminiscing. We were happy to find this place to take a break while walking from Chinatown to our hotel on a hot day.
5
Took advantage of the happy hour lunchtime vibe that all the eateries seem to go in for along both Clarke and Boat quays. Really enjoyed the sangria and the super tapas dishes we tried. What a fabulous riverfront place to pass the time and enjoy some of the good life
4
We happened to be walking past looking for a place to have a couple of drinks on a Sunday night - I was with mum, so nothing full on.Octapas had a live band which sounded very talented, and it wasn't very busy, so we thought we'd try it out.We had a couple of cocktails and some churros. Service was friendly. The band was happy to take song requests, and had a couple of funny stories to tell.The drinks were quite expensive - $15 Tequila Sunrise, $16.50 Mango Daiquiri. We had a slightly annoying Canadian patron that decided to sing louder than the band - you could tell he thought he was the bees knees. His lady friend seemed slightly embarrassed, but the band just went with it.The night would've been lovely all round if he wasn't there (obviously no reflection of the establishment)
4
We have been here a few times although my partner takes his colleagues more regularly. It's a nice tapas bar by the river. Great atmosphere, not too expensive and the food and service is consistently good.
4
good food, simple, but tasty with a generous serve. Also good service. Look as though live music may have been planned for later in the evening but very quiet when I was there in the early evening.
4
Nice selection of Tapa's and a welcoming atmosphere. Called in here twice during our short stay in Singapore and both times were thoroughly enjoyable.
4
I went with three colleagues for diner. It was very tasty but little expensive. All restaurants in the neighborhood have more or less the same price level. The live band is good! Be aware when the band starts playing you cannot hear each other anymore.
5
You really can eat your way around the world in Singapore and this is the best representation of Spain in town. There is plenty of seating by the river or you can enjoy the air conditioned bar. Excellent tapas and sangria await you.
4
the setting is everything! Riverside marina bright lights and evening warmth make for a very relaxed and. Comfortable setting. The tapas is imaginative and good eating.
4
We came here by chance, when we walked in just before 8pm there wasn't that many people. It slowly started to fill up. Food delicious, cocktails good, Enigma band fantastic, service shocking. We had the chorizo, potatoes, meatballs,scallops, garlic bread and the winner for me was the negro paella. Would come again for the food. But something seriously needs to be gone about the service
3
We're locals anticipating a trip to Spain, and this constituted part of our research. We ordered paella, octopus, chicken croquettes and fish with aioli sauce. Along with a beer, the price came to $120.The octopus was great; but the paella rice tastes like something I can buy in a box at the local supermarket; and the fish and croquettes like they had just been out of the freezer and reheated, not made on the premises. So overall, the food was tasty, but not special, and definitely overpriced.Although, part of the price was definitely due to location and atmosphere - candle-lit on the river side, which is great, but would definitely appeal more to tourists than to locals who are very familiar with Clarke Quay
3
This place has a lovely location on the waterfront and the menu looked appealing. The food itself was nice and reasonably priced. The service was the let down as we felt as though we had inconvenienced the staff member by choosing to dine with them and noticed their head shaking reaction to other customers as they walked in off the street. Considering there was only a small handful of people dining here, we would have thought that customers would be welcomed. We left without ordering more drinks and dessert as we were unable to get the attention of the staff member for a good 25 minutes after finishing our meals. Overall, we left feeling disappointed
4
We never thought we would be eating Paella in Singapore but weary from a day's sightseeing, we wanted to just step outside our hotel (the Novotel) and go to one of the nearby restaurants at Clarke Quay, that looked inviting,and ended up Octapas. The restaurant was already busy, tables overlooking the water were all taken, but where we were seated, we had a great people watching table. The staff were pleasant and looked after us well, but their English was limited. We chose a bowl of olives(generous and very tasty) whilst we looked at the menu. With the high price of wine and beer in Singapore we were also pleased that our arrival coincided with Happy Hour (6-8pm). To have selected a number of tapas dishes would have cost more than we wanted to spend. So instead we chose a Paella with 'the works' for 2. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait, which we were quite happy with. The dish when it arrived was delicious and I think around $40sg which we thought was good value. Looking at other peoples dishes(mainly small plates of tapas) as they went by I think we made the better choice
3
Inattentive staff ( except for on lovely young lady). Pretty sure they forgot our order. The tostada was tasty as were the prawns and bacon but the skewers were not very nice.
1
Service not great.
Food too fat, not good and Very disgusting. I don't like to be mean, but when it's expensive like that and you sell bad food it means you stole the customers .
4
Great location right on Clarke Quay with great views of the river. We had tapas and wine here spread over a few hours. The food was very well presented and good value. Wine was also nice. Would recommend.
5
Been here twice, the foods and service have never been disappointing. Me and my partner really enjoyed the grilled prawn wrapped with bacon and the pesto is the best! Look forward to visiting again anytime soon!

We stopped by late at night for snacks, and ordered four vegetarian options - all four were not that good. The eggplant/bread one was quite basic, the potato croquettes were ok but the associated sauce didn't go well with this dish, the orange salad was over-proportionately greens, and the fried potatoes didn't have much flavour. Service was ok, but had to ask three times to get our bill (which took too long). Definitely not recommended for vegetarians
1
Been in Singapore for a week and we have eaten out 3 times a day. Had lunch here today. Cost $89 for 3 of us. Portions tiny and none of us were happy with our food. Overpriced and food was terrible. All 3 of us went round the corner and had something else to eat after we left. Will never go back!!$8foofoof us.
5
While on a long weekend in Singapore and staying at the nearby Novotel my wife and I tried Octapas one evening, we were not disappointed and enjoyed a lovely evening with 4 items from the tapas list.We so enjoyed our first visit there that we went again another night and had 4 different items. I can say that the 8 items we had over the 2 visits were lovely.When next in Singapore we will definitely be back at Octapas to try the other fare on offer.The beer was lovely especially when we had 4 for the price of 2 during Happy Hour
3
Fun atmosphere, inattentive service, pricey (14 for a tiger beer?!). Food was average, croquettes were tasty, stuffed mushrooms were lackluster (under cooked and under seasoned). Went in search of vegetables which we got in the form of the orange salad: spring greens with cheese almonds and mandarin oranges with a vinegarette. There was a fun cover band that saved the evening
5
Great location right on the water's edge in Clarke Quay. We visited for lunch and it was very quiet - imagine it would be busy at night given it's location. Excellent tapas rounded off by some fabulous churros. Good service and very good value for money
3
Octapas is an authentic spanish offering. The ambience is dark with western mysic sung in spanish. Anyway, the place is decent for chilling. You can try the paella (for 4 persons), the taste is good enough with a more than satisfying portion. Price is towards the expensive though
5
I had a dinner with my wife here, Octapas serve you great Spanish meal. We had paella and some other dish. Live music is available too here
4
Went here after walking round Fort Canning Park. Happy hour till 20.00hrs made drinks reasonable. Sangria and Tiger both good. Ordered Garlic Bread and Fried Squid as a snack , both lovely. Sat by river watching turtles coming up for air by Reed Bridge.Top Tip: toilets very clean but not in restaurant but down left handside in the arcade.
5
Exquisite food, Clarke Quay, Singapore, what more could you ask for? We were looking for Belgian beer and mussels, not open ( what a blessing) . Potatoes and chorizo, grilled ham wrapped asparagus, tomato tostadas, and the best clams we've ever had ,with garlic and olive
4
We popped in here for lunch along the way of our hop on hop off bus. We had battered fish, battered squid, stuffed mushrooms, an Octopas cocktail, Evian water and 2 beers and the cost was $100. The food was nice but the squid was a bit overdone. It nice and quiet while we were there mid afternoon so service was well timed and staff friendly and we had a very enjoyable relaxing time
5
Octapas is located at Clarke Quay and overlooks the Singapore River. There is seating both inside the restaurant and outside depending on your preference. There is an extensive list of both food and drink to choose from - we struggled to narrow down our choices because everything looked sooo good. We had lychee mojitos which were some of the best we had our whole trip. I can't recall all the tapas dishes we ate but I remember the shredded lamb and potatoes very well. Highly, highly recommend this place, we loved it.
1
I'll disclaim this review by saying we left even before ordering. So I have no idea what the food tastes like. I can say that the staff is the most helpless people I've ever experienced, and that includes the chef. We came with our two year old boy, and asked if they could serve some form of vegetables with his tortilla de patata. We suggested a few stalks of asparagus, as they had ham wrapped asparagus on the menu. The answer was that we could only order the full portion, without ham, but they would still charge the 16$++ for it. Not happening. We then asked if they could suggest any other vegetables. The answer was "our orange salad". For a two-year old? Right. I spoke to the chef, who seemed completely incapable. I asked if he could just chop up some veggies and stir fry them, but that was clearly over his level of competency. I even offered to do it myself. I have a feeling all the food is pre-made and only heated during service - or non-service, I should say. We walked away
4
Went for dinner and was impressed with the place, service fast and precise but some times no acknowledgment from waiting staff, food speaks for it's self, what it says in the menu is what comes on the plate, we tried maybe 8-9 dishes and all were great, maybe if I have one complaint was the fish was a bit rare, price, not cheap top end of budget but then it's on the river front !
5
Steps away from the Clark Quay MRT station, it is across the footbridge to this neat outdoor covered spot on the river. Lit up tour boats pass by, and the skyline forms a backdrop. The indoor Octapas place across the walkway is a noisy rock group ear killer. But outside, I can relax, sip good wine and eat tapas treats. Pricey, but nice for making my cheap calls around the world using Singtel's 019 prefix and for reading if no friends with me. Good and courteous service
4
I've eaten here many times and the food is always reliable. However, the service had become so 'pushy' that it gets in the way of the food, and conversation. I don't need to be asked 12 times if I want another beer, before I've even finished the first one. My advise to the staff, step back a little and let guests enjoy their experience. They will order more if/when they want something
4
We ate spanish foods and all of them very delicious. Next to river and around is so lovely, midnight you can going on inside bar because live music inside and perfect performance, so success... if you want to eat delicious things and listening good live music you must visit this restorant&ba
3
The food is ok but everything serve in small plate. This is not a place for hungry one. Salmon tostadas is quite good. Nice location, sit, sip sangria and enjoy the wind from the river.
1
We went there for a late Sunday dinner. It wasn't crowded, but the service was slow and they didn't seem to care. After we waited an hour for our food we asked for the check to leave. We ordered our main course when we sat down and they said it would take 30 minutes; after an hour we were still waiting. There are too many good place to eat in Clark Quay so try someplace else.
4
This is a very good restaurant. However the food wasn't amazing. It's just good quality tapas. It was quite expensive but I guess that's for the riverside restaurant price. The staff were good and the services was that of what you would expect at a standard taps restaurant. They bring the food as soon as it's ready. The ribs were really good as so was the calamari! The scallops were poor. Drinks arrived fast.
3
It was not my first time to Clark Quay, but it was for my colleague. We went to the quay in the evening and looked for a place for dine & drink. Finally, we chose Octapas because the size of tapas would allow us to test many dishes.The special drink of the month, e.g. berry mixed Sangria, was quite good. The foods were also okay. The price was a bit high though as it is in one of the main tourist / expat spots.View wise, the restaurant on the opposite side of river gave a better view of Clark Quay
3
Located in Clarke quae, so there is great view but Too expensive, as all the restaraunts in that area. We had 1 plate of paellias for two, 2 starters and a bottle of water and we payed almost 100 dollars. Note that the water costed 11 dollars. The food was ok, but overpriced
4
Stopped in here for a light lunch. Ordered 2 tapas meals and a beer each. Food was excellent. Finished off with Churros and chocolate sauce that were delicious.Prices reasonable for Singapore. Service good. Recommend. Recently on another visit had seafood Paella. It was amazing. Worth the wait
5
Right off the bat, Tapas means 'small Spanish savoury dishes'. So, for those reviewing making comments about the plates being small, now you know why. There were also comments about it being "touristy". The entire area caters to tourists, expects, locals, etc... It's an eatery and shopping area, much like MOST of the areas in Singapore.... No on to the food: Fantastic Tapas! We're not big seafood eaters so we opted for the beef and chicken dishes and they were all absolutely fantastic and seasoned perfectly. There's an abundance of garlic used which is fantastic! The spicy potatoes were great, chicken and Beef skewers with chimichurri which was amazing! We ordered many items twice. Most food like this is expensive in Singapore, so deal with it. If you're not prepared to spend a little more for ethnic foods, then eat local foods. The location is fantastic if you're looking to feel like you're on a little holiday for a moment after a long workday/workweek. Service was fantastic. We will be back
4
Dined here on a friday night, location in Boat Quay is very good right on the water, so perfect for warmer nights. Make sure you take advantage of the happy hour specials on drinks which is 50% off before 8pm...a must for when alcohol in Singapore.Service was good, food was received in a timely manner, and was really good, try the all meat paella!Would definitely dine again
2
After a long walk we sought for a cold beer and some tapas. Positiv:- Good tapas. E.g. the gazpacho was tasty and refreshing- Nice place next to the riverNegativ:- Quite expensive (very small portions)- Unfriendly staff. Plates were almost thrown on our table. Waitress dicided by himself to keep all change for his tip and vanished- Table was dirty and they cleaned it only after asking a few timesOverall I would not visit the place again
4
We were wandering along the Quays, it was getting late, we fancied a wee change in the food line so decided to try here. It was busy but we got a table outside overlooking the river. Octapas has a really nice laid-back, even kinda romantic, ambiance to it - the tables aren't all squashed together so even when it's busy, you can chat away quite happily to your dinner partner and it's nice to sit and watch the brightly-lit river boats go by. We both fancied paella and it does state on the menu that there will be a 30 minute wait but we were fine with that. We ordered beers and sangria to help us while away the time!I needed the loo but Octapas doesn't have any of its own. The waiter was most apologetic and escorted me personally through the bar and across the street to nearby toilets. Sweet of him! Our mixed meat paella arrived a bit ahead of schedule and was really nice, plenty of it too. We both enjoyed it very much. I note other reviewers have found Octapas expensive but I guess that depends on your perspective. Coming from the Edinburgh area in Scotland, where pretty average places charge a fortune for food, we found this to be comparable price-wise but the food was better than average and the setting and ambiance, lovely
5
Great foods! Definitely hit happy hour with half price sangrias! Can order what you need without too much. It was fun to order lots of different appetizers and share. Sat outside along river. Beautiful!
4
lots of restaurants to choose from and we weren't disappointed .
The food was tasty and plentiful ( if a tad overpriced ) but the peaceful surroundings and views made up for this
5
A truly wonderful evening spent at Octapas, table right by the river, live music and great, great food. I would definitely recommend the baby back ribs. Well presented, tasty and beautiful food. Will definitely eat here again.
4
Octapas is a fun place in Clarke Quay for a night out with friends. The live music is really good and enjoyable.
3
Was walking around and was in the mood for some small plates. Had the sea bass and scallops - both pretty tasty. And a nice location!
4
I recently spent three weeks in Singapore and visited the Octapas several times for great food and entertainment.I highly recommend the Valenciana, their signature dish from Valencia, which includes chorizo, chicken, mussels, squids, shrimps & fish. It is delicious and great for sharing with others as it comes in serving sizes for 2 or 4 people.They have both outdoor and indoor seating. The outdoor seating is river-side with nice views of Clarke Quay and the indoor seating is cool (AirCon) and entertained by Enigma, a live band that is really good.I found the manager, Hazel, to be very good at making sure you have a wonderful dining experience. I highly recommend you go to visit the Octapas next time you are in Clarke Quay
4
We last visited Octapas in early 2015 for dinner, this time we took our work team there for lunch and it was tops. We were the only people out on the terrace beside the river, but it was undershade and the fans kept us nicely cooled. We ordered a range of food to try and the beers were always cold. For mains we tried one of the Paellas and it was sensational. I think spent about 2 hours just kicking back relaxing, nice way to start the Friday wind dow
3
A great location on the promenade to watch the night become alive in Singapore. Drinks were outrageously priced (welcome to Singapore). Our paella must have been forgotten in the oven because it came out a overcooked. Perhaps the staff is overwhelmed and try to seat too many patrons
2
This restaurant, like most on Clarke Quay, caters to turists and also to groups. Service is quite lousy, since they seem to entertain primarily the tour guides who bring customers there. A place to better avoid
3
Good located, great view towards the river. Service was friendly and the food was good, but not fabulous. The size for a main course is small, and the one came 30 minutes before the other. They have a happy hour before 8 p.m. for the drinks
4
The food there is very good and the view is perfect family and couple. I just hope the staff is more smiley.
5
Very good paella. Great location at Clark's Quay next to the riverside. Popular area in Singapore. Good mojito and sangria.
4
This is the second time we are hitting this place in consecutive trips to Singa. I think this is the best spot in Clarke's for riverside dining. I like the tapas range and quality as well.
4
I had drinks here with a friend, the location is wonderful, right on the canal and by a bridge so it's great for people watching and a nice view. The service was a little slow and they seemed more interested in closing up that serving us, but it was a good spot, and I really do love the name, great name for a waterfront tapas restaurant :-
4
Everything in Clarke Quay is so expensive, but Octapas actually had some reasonably priced dishes that were decent sized despite being tapas. The few that we had were really quite good. Combined with a great show of live music, and a fairly attentive wait staff, I'd recommend this spot
3
Wish there was a 'Good' category rather than just 'Very good' as 'Average' is a bit non committal? For the area with lots of restaurants you are spoilt for choice and as many people there are breaking their journeys across the world, as we were, we were happy to have chosen Octapas and can say it was 'good'. We had a table by the river and we enjoyed watching the river boats passing by, soaking up the atmosphere in the heat with the hint of a breeze!The food was acceptable for the evening and we began with battered fish and a marinaded grilled squid, then chose the Paella Valenciana for 2 with a Â£30 bottle of Australian Chardonnay wine. Was this average for Singapore we don't know but it was all fine for us and we would go to this place again.Muchas Gracias
3
Had just a single night stopover in Singapore on the way to Australia. Wanted to have dinner at Clarke Quay, just which of the many restaurants to choose?Octapas was advertising a house special paella and we thought that would fit the bill. We knew it would take a good 30 minutes to prepare, and it did. Luckily happy hour went on until 8pm so we could have a couple of drinks each and a leisurely meal.The paella was fine, the service sufficiently attentive for my liking, the restaurant location very nice by the quay side
4
There are so many restaurants at Clark Quay to choose from, we just got lucky with this one. It has a wide variety of tapas, of very good quality, and with good service. The choice of wine by the glass was very limited, but the good food was worth it
3
Service was average but at least they had a long happy hour, as the normal cost of drinks was $15.00 for a beer. The wine was good - McGuigan from Australia & half price. We had deep fried squid & chicken in a cream sauce & really good garlic bread. The food was not bad but still pretty average. I know Singapore is expensive but dining is really pricey & I've yet to find a great value for money restaurant
3
Had a late night Tapas meal there with my wife. The service was quite fast, the food was ok, nothing super special but not bad either for a late night meal. The quantities are not so good and the prices are above average. The music was good and atmosphere was fun
4
Wonderful food in a great riverside setting. Enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. Best Singapore sling.
On the expensive side for a meal but very enjoyable
5
Ate here for dinner. Entree and Paella was delicious, Ssangria for drinks. Service was good. Sitting right on the riverfront was an added bonus. Great place to sit relax and watch the world go by. Meal was reasonable priced for dinner and drinks. Highly recommended.
3
There's and inside and then the outside on the river at Clark Quay. Outside is stunning and feels great. Food is average and expensive. Drinks are insanely expensive. I wouldn't go back. Too many other restaurants there.
4
Excellent food (shrimp in bacon, red snapper, garic bread) but hard to get service and an incorrect bill. Great view on the river
2
Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for a quick lunch and drink. The place was almost completely deserted both inside and out, but service was still painfully slow. We had a couple of tapas style dishes which arrived about 15 minutes apart. Neither were particularly good either, with the grilled squid really disappointing (and cold).Drinks were though cheap and the beer cold, so perhaps good for a [very] leisurely drink by the river rather than somewhere to eat
4
Held a department event at Octapas for 30 pax and made reservations in advance. Joy the assistant manager provided me with multiple packages and we finally agreed on a 6 course tapas with seafood paella menu and happy hour drinks. On the actual day the staff had arranged the seating to accomodate our large group and service was prompt and effecient. Overall the food was fantastic and received positive feedback from everyone. Appreciate also that Joy made the effort to stay on that evening after her shift to ensure the event went smoothly. Definately will keep Octapas in mind for future events. Cheers
2
Went here for lunch, ordered a pint of draught Heineken, garlic bread and chicken breast paprika and peppers. Drink was fine, cold and quick service. While I was waiting for my food I was watching the waiter clear tables and empty the garbage bins, then the bell rang and he went to collect my food. I watched him pick up the utensils food end first and put them on to the plate, when he carried the food across to my table his hand was touching the garlic bread. There was not a great deal of chicken certainly not a breast worth and it was swimming in oil. Garlic bread was fine, just wished the waiter hadn't been touching it. Cost S$33, over priced I think. Nice location next to the river, only one other table dining there at the time, maybe a sign I should have picked up on
5
After living in Spain for 1.5 years, I am picky about my tapas. Needless to say, I was very impressed with Octapas. The food was good, we had good service, and they kept the classic tapas without trying to add flair to them. I would definitely go back
1
Planned a Chinese New Year gathering at Octapas and called in advance to make reservations and check whether happy hour is available on public holidays.On the actual day, we arrived and realized no reservations were made and no happy hour was available despite having checked twice beforehand. Very disappointing
4
I was glad we stopped by in the afternoon and picked out a table to reserve by the water. It was reserved for us as we arrived 15 minutes early. Check the times for happy hour to save $. What a romantic spot with the evening lights all around us reflecting off the river.We made short work on the pitcher of sangria offered at a low happy hour price. Dinner was delicious as well and we were not rushed away after eating but you'll want to stroll around the area on and off the river. Clarke Quay is a lively area at night that you can enjoy safely. The boats are cruising around with people touring the area by boat.The service was good without being over attentive.I wouldn't say that Octopas is astounding but very nice and no complaints
4
Good view besides the back waters Bay area. The servers can be a little more interactive & friendly but cant blame them. I might have ordered an extra dish which i did not want but they took care of it without much fuss.
2
The food was pretty good the 1/2 of my order I received. Service in Signpore a an be really hit and miss . Here was a miss. They sat me right away. Never came back to get. Drink order or food order. Finally after 10 minutes flagged someone down to take order. I received entree after 15 minutes or so. I order a desert when I placed my entree order. I ask for it twice finally after 25 minutes just asked for bill. Desert was on bill had to have it removed. Waitress said sorry as she rushed by. Did not seem to sincere. Way too May choices in Clarke Quay to deal with service this bad.
2
We had a dinner here during our stay in Singapore. The tapas were OK and the location by the river was very nice. Service was not that good and couple of things went also wrong. It was quite expencive, too. Customers need to use also the public toilet, which was not that nice
3
Visited with a colleague whilst in Singapore for business. We ate in the riverside section of the restaurant. The food is tapas-style, but nothing too adventurous. There was nothing wrong with any of the dishes, but nothing really stood out on the menu as being a must-have.Service was alright. I'm not sure that I would return
3
This restaurant ha both indoor and riverside dining. It is a nice venue with a relatively concise menu focusing on seafood and appetizers. Service was fairly inattentive which we shared with the manager who promised to address that with the staff.The Pallela main course was rather bland and overpriced for the amount of seafood in included. The appetizers were much better than the main. Drinks very pricey.Overall it is just OK but nothing special. Take away the riverside view and there is no reason to revisit
2
Ill keep this short and sweet. If you're looking for something nice to eat, stay away from this place! The food here is mediocre at best as far as spanish tapas goes. However, its a decent place for drinks if you take in the view, and if youre looking for slightly more elaborate bar snacks then perhaps this place may not be a total waste
1
This place seems to rely heavily on tourists and therefore offers nothing special at all. Profit margin on dishes is high and the quality is quite frankly well below average. I visited Singapore on business and had a table for one as I'd arrived an hour prior. They could not have been less keen to accommodate me and the service was almost non-existent. Food arrived eventually and was shockingly bad. The battered fish was cold in the middle and not cooked. The waiter ran off before I had a chance to tell him to forget it, then the dish returned within a few minutes, piping hot. Terrible quality fish, no idea what type, but grey, strong smelling and taste, chewy and oily. It turned my stomach and I could taste it for hours afterwards. The worst dining experience for a long time. Avoid
3
We had tapas for dinner at this trendy, somewhat overpriced riverfront restuarant. The food and service were decent. The live music was mediocre and made conversation difficult
4
We ended up in this tapas bar accidently, as it suddenly started to pour outside.Both indoor and outdoor seating.Service was swift. They have a live band, only starts playing late in the evening.Everything we ordered tasted delicious.( creamy mushrooms, garlic bread, sauteed garlic shrimps, lamb shoulder). Good cava by the glass
1
Sorry..but very disappointing. Looked good from afar and set up good on river with nice views of Clarke Quay but good points end there. Octopus was rubbery, dry and no taste and paella inedible. Seafood all seemed like was frozen and heated up....maybe that's why it takes 30 min for the paella. Service slow and dismissive. I don't like to give bad reviews but only do it because place has potential and really needs a hard look at its service and food. A place should take pride in the food they serve and not just take advantage of the tourists......or maybe they just don't care as people will continue to dine here due to its pretty location and faÃ§ade.
3
We had the beef with garlic and it was tasty. Emmental cheese was also good and other caramel iced onion tapas. Had an apple juice and it was surprisingly good.
A little bit pricey for us.
2
We had dinner in this Clark Quay riverside place and tried their tapas and paella...
Ambiance and staff were quite ok but the food was not as good as we were expecting...
Better luck next visit
2
This was our second try at a spanish restaurant in Singapore. We ordered the Roasted Lamb Shoulder & Mashed Potato and Mariscos paella (mixture of mussel, squid, shrimp, fish). The roasted lamb was okay; quite a small portion for the price and kinda hard. The paella was too oily and the after effects of this version of the paella stayed for the next day as well. The ambience was also just average; the live music hadn't started yet and was quite quite :). Overall I would give it a miss. Service was good
1
For starters it wasn't my choice to come here, we in Singapore and we going to a Spanish restaurant, what is this group thinking of. (This was going to be a similar theme to our group holiday, i.e. Hanoi, KFC).Sorry, this was the worst restaurant I've been to for a while, the main food wasn't tasty, how i didn't get poisoning i don't know. Paella was very dry, old & rubbery. There was a group of 4 couples of which 3 had Paella all different, but for us was bad the others well I think I could build a house from it, they were set hard, we all complained but of course they didn't understand us what we complaining about, but understand us with our ordering, we reluctantly paid and left. Not to return. This experience is below terrible. This place give Spanish food a very bad nam
4
We stopped off here for some food after exploring Clarke Quay. We were lucky enough to get a table outside though wasn't next to the quay as it was really busy.I'm vegetarian and there was plenty on offer for me. The service was quick and the portions were large! We opted for 3 portions each which was way to much. Tapas was excellent. I had Emental Cheese Croquettes with Tomato Jam (4pcs), SautÃ©ed Mushrooms in Sherry & Garlic or Cream Sauce and some bread. As we were there at happy hr got drinks half price which was great :)Was a lovely setting having food and a drink at nighttime watching the world go by and the quay in front of you. Would defo come back here an
3
I'm not Spanish and going by the 'tapas' I'd wager no one on this kitchen is either. We had some pretty poor attempts at tapas. The cheese croquettes were bland, the iberico ham croquettes had a weird texture, the chorizo and potato was not even close to how this dish should be done but it was ok. The iberico ham tostado was appalling, dry hard bread with a sliver of ham on top. The house specialty of octopus had a weird smell and was served on mashed potato. Drinks were half price so that was good. Service was decent as well.This is a very ordinary tapas bar
5
I first tried Octapas last year when I went to Singapore for the first time and it was beautiful ! Best tapas I've had! I just recently went to Singapore for the second time and insisted my friends should try it. Again, it was delicious ! The cream chicken was a favourite of mine as well as the lamb! If you share it works out reasonable in price and you and try everything! The meals came out quickly and the service was amazing ! Also, for cheesecake fans, try the cheesecake plate! Wow
4
We sat inside . The place was a bit dark and they had only one waiter who was handling our order and the bar at the same time. Luckily only two tables were occupied so he could manage. Service was quick and the staff told us ahead that the paella we ordered would take 20 minutes. The starters were good and good portion sizes. The vegetarian paella was a large serving and came steaming hot with artichokes and other vegetables. Was really tasty. All their dishes are priced on the higher side. To go their once is not bad. By 8.30 pm the place gets very busy and then you find more waiters rushing around
1
I wish that staff wouldn't assume that I'm an 'Ang Mo Tourist' just because I have a white face which then excuses their bad service. I've lived in Singapore for 4 years and this is probably the worst service I've experienced to date.The waiter seemed to be totally disinterested in his job to the point of forgetting to place the order for 2 items we ordered on 2 separate occasions. He also used his hand to wipe his nose in full view of 2 potential customers. The girl who brought me the bill looked like I'd just asked to chop her arm off.The food was a lot less than average and I suspect the chef is no more Spanish than me, if he/she is then they should be ashamed of themselves.The only saving grace was the drinks were half price. Don't waste your time or hard earned cash here like I did.A word to the management. Be careful as to how your staff treat people with a white face today they've done your establishment a great disservice because I'll certainly be advising my friends not to bother. Bad news/reviews spread like wildfire
3
Nice location by the riverside, outdoor sitting is nice. Food is good quality but the portions are very small for the price, like two small pieces of bread with ham for 12$. Happy hour is worth it for the drinks, service was not outstanding but friendly enough
5
Stumbled onto this place after a few jugs of margaritas and ordered dinner. The tapas was ahhhhhmazing and the love band was fantastic. We had a great night in this place.
4
An excellent option to dine wine and Spanish tapas. The location is very good at Clarke Quay area and they have the best live music later in the evening
2
Very small quantities of food for the price quoted. Thus, quite expensive and one will have to go again for a meal to some other restaurant. Food quality was OK
1
Had a bad experience, ordered churros. The churros are tasteless and the chocolate is not refined. A Spanish place that ran out of sangria. We spilled a cup of drink and the servers didn't notice. We need to ask specifically to clear up the spill. Overall, a pretty terrible experience.
3
Buzzing tapas restaurant in Clarke Quay. Lovely outdoor seating and quite a menu. Wine menu could be more extensive but it seems beer is the favourite beverage in Singapore. Food was good and reasonably priced. Waiters were friendly but seemed to be far too little staff for such a busy restaurant
3
Like others reviewing before me, I found this place expensive, but so are most of places on the quayside. Pints of Tiger at 16 dollars each, but before 8pm it's half-price, so I ordered 2 having checked they would both be half price. Food was ok, they have a few veggie dishes and I actually found the portions bigger than what I'm used to in UK tapas places (2 wedges of tortilla for example). One thing I really wasn't keen on was how mild the potatas bravas was. It's supposed to have a chilli kick which was completely lacking. Service was good

A great place to dine in Singapore. Good atmosphere, good views and wonderful food. Especially good at happy hour when selected drinks are half price. Beef marinated in sherry is particularly good.

I went here with my wife & another couple, as one of our group wanted a break from Asian cuisine. What a mistake. The food was appalling, the service ordinary, the price overly expensive for what you get, and the portion size minute. I ordered the Gratinised fish, it came burnt , hard as a rock, in what could be best described as a splash of pumpkin soup or puree, and was totally tasteless. The paella wasn't much better, not very moist and in parts almost crunchy. Would never go bak

Here's a tip - if you're going to have a beer and something to eat, try the opposite side of the river. The side of Octapas is prettier, which means you want to sit opposite it to enjoy the view. I had a beer and a few tapas plates late afternoon. Service was slow, food was below average, prices were above average, atmosphere was zero, heat was high. Just nothing worked. Just pass and go elsewhere - Boat Quay (further towards the mouth of the river) offers many better eating options
2
Nice location but that's the only good thing. Staff is ok, just doing their job. Dishes are very small and super overpriced!! Totally a TOURIST TRAP: payed $70 for 3 small tapas and 2 drinks during happy hour(!!)... Guess what, we had a good kebap just around the corner to fill our empty stomaches:
3
Location is greate in Clarke Quay nice sitting outside.
Food was just okay, nothing espectacular there are better places for tapas.
But a place to have a great srink in a great location.
3
Enjoyed the food and the beer but was pretty expensive for what we had. Still we had a great view and good service so overall was good. Toilets are a long way from the restaurant.
4
This is a good venue for just chilling out and the band are very good. The seating spacing is nicely arranged and you feel crowded. Its located by the Singapore River and there is lots to do and see there. I highly recommend this venue.
1
This is the only good thing about your place . Bad food and high price . Command an Heineken for 16sing doll !!!!! WDF!!Hot like hell , uncomfortable and dirty. You call it a restaurant . I would say a dump no more
3
We ate here one night because we needed to quickly grab something before we went to the Night Safari. The food was very expensive and whilst it was nice, it was nothing special. We paid about $120 for 5 tapas dishes and three drinks. We did go during happy hour so drinks were half price. The restaurant is located on Clarke Quay which is lovely
2
Right on Clarke Quay it is, like many of the other places, a good option to sit outside, have a drink, and people watch. And I would stop there. Foolishly, I went on to the food. Everything was over salted and over sauced as if trying to cover the food up. Octopus and shrimp were both overcooked. Just overall a sub-par over priced place, unfortunately not unusual when in a touristy area, but I would try my luck elsewhere
3
Nice postion overlooking the river but service was poor ( bought out our olives and bread at the same time as the main meal) Overpriced would be my commen
3
We really wanted to eat at Clark Quay because it's buzzy on a Friday night.It was surprisingly ok. The tapas are quite small but the paella is quite large. For four of us we had four tapas and two paellas and were full. The squid ink paella is the pick of the menu.
5
Tonight we had our best meal in Singapore. The male waiters were very efficient and friendly. We had yummy tomatoe bread, prawns wrapped in bacon, melt in your mouth deep fried squid, praprika chicken and tender sweet lamb with mint and potatoes. Our food came out very quickly at just the right time. We'll done of crew
4
Given that Clarke Quay seems to close down at the weekends I was really pleased to find this nice restaurant open. The service was on the slow side and the restaurant quiet. I had an excellent paella and the restaurant added extra prawns for me at SDG10.00. Good value bottle of white wine and enjoyed sitting outside over looking the quay in a torrential downpour. The few other people were getting a bit stressed by slow service but I had plenty of time and it fitted the mood
2
Couldn't sit at a table unless I ordered a drink straight away. Could I wait for my friends? No. So once they were ready we left.
2
Tried a few drinks a paella and garlic bread to share for 2. Drinks ok. Garlic bread average as was the paella. Better luck next time. Should have taken my phone and checked on trip advisor as it's normally very accurate and fair
2
 We went there yesterday for dinner with my girlfriend for our first night out in singapour . We've got a table of 2 in the smoking area , really nice view of Clark quay but unfortunately that was the only highlight of our evening . We wait for 15 minutes before the waiter ask for drinks or appetiser . By this time we were ready to order everything. Our order was very simple 2 drinks , olives and Spanish ham to start with and then for main chicken and lamb shoulder. After around 10 minutes ( still waiting for the drinks) the chicken and Spanish ham arrived together ! I'll ask the waiter about our drinks and told him that the chicken was for a main course , he told me that this restaurant doesn't do entree and main , all the food must arrive together ! What!?? Maybe he should say that when we order . Well I think it's pretty crazy that a restaurant do not allow his guest to enjoy an entree before his main.... Anyway you can see that the staff wasn't train enough , being in hospitality myself in Australia I expected higher standard for a restaurant in Singapore . I received my main ( lamb shoulder) at last when my girlfriend already finished her meal , not nice for a romantic dinner. By the way we actually never received the olives but they were on the bill...About the food , nothing special really , the size for a main course is small. It is very average taste too.The price was 140 SGD for 2 drinks , 1 tapas , 2 main, 1 dessert. Really expensive for a restaurant like that , not worth it!  Micka and Jenny
2
Should have suspected when they don't serve sangria in jugs... The lychee sangria tasted like canned lychee with a little bit of white wine. Disappointing.
4
Very good quality food, prices on high side but still understandable vs. the quality, service and everything. Around you can find places double the price and very poor value. Do not get fooled, check menus and prices and do not fall in half price traps as some tourists seem to do. This was really positive surprise among them
5
Nice place with a cool band. Friendly staff, but a bit difficult to get their attention when you want to order. They close quite early so it it a better place to start than end the night
5
Had the best night here... The half price cocktails until 8pm were awesome and packed with yum. Spanish omelette was the best I have had anywhere in the world...Paella was worth waiting for... The band added some excitement to the night... Great songs done well... Well done Octapas
1
This was our 3rd time at the restaurant during the last year. The menu seems to have changed for the worse and 3 out of 4 dishes (chorizo, beef/chicker skewer, squid) were hugely overcooked resulting in rubbery seafood, chicken and touch meat. The usual price for beers in Singapore is $7-8 while this tourist trap charges $15. The selection of food is pretty poor with very few vegetables on offer. I would recommend elsewhere in Clarke Quay, particularly the South side of the river where I've generally found food to be much better
3
My wife and I had spent the day touring Singapore and wanted to finish off with a meal in Clarke Quay. We walked around and say Octapas so thought we'd give it a try.Very quick service and the food was good, but not fabulous. I think they try and get you in and out as quick as possible so the food and drinks came out all over the place, no real order to it.The food tasted like it had been prepped before hand and re-heated, I could be wrong, but it just didn't have the taste we were expecting.The staff were very friendly. Would we go back, at a pinch maybe
4
Visited Octapas on a few occasions either for pre dinner or after dinner drinks.Nice location and atmosphere. The service from all the staff we encountered was great.We didn't eat here, but it was always busy, so it must be good.We would visit again when we return to Singapore.
4
Ate here twice during my stay in Singapore. Good atmosphere. Friendly staff and quality of food was good. Prawns in oil and garlic- several cloves- delicious. Tried several tapas and all pretty good. Nice atmosphere by the river.
2
I had visited this place often, and on previous occasions the food was really good & so was the service. Its disappointing to see this time it was otherwise. Service was horrible and so was the food.
5
Food good - staff fantastic - terrific band - try it and I'm sure you'll be back....... A must if you are adding through or live in Singapore
4
We live in Singapore and tried the Octapas bar for the first time recently. We reserved a riverside table as we know how busy it gets down in that area, our table was perfect and ready for us in plenty of time. We were extremely pleased with our meal and drinks but this review is for the service we received. I would like to comment on Hazel (who is the Assistant Manager). Hazel was absolutely wonderful, extremely attentive and professional but had that personal touch, she was informative and gave us excellent advice. We will be returning to this restaurant as although I know there are plenty to choose from in Singapore - they don't have Hazel looking out for you! Well done!
1
Tried to get some lunchfeeling today at the river. But the crying drunk australiens (or what else, animals anyway) made a nice midday to a unharmonish adventure. Even worse is the poor quality of the food. The meat was uneatable. The potatoes from microwave.the only highlight was the staff, they are ok
5
After a disappointing start with a nearby restaurant , we went back the following day and had lunch at Octapas, the service and food were excellent, definitely going bac

This was one of the few places open after 3:00 pm on a weekday afternoon for lunch, and so we ended up here for some tapas. We had the chorizo (which was ok), and the grilled squid (which was a very chewy), and some garlic bread (which wasn't freshly made). The quantities for the tapas were quite generous. We also had 2 sangrias (red & white), and found them both rather weak / mild.The service was good and prompt. The restaurant is well located on the river front.There are other restaurants on Clarke Quay that serve better food, and provide better value for mone
4
We went here for happy hour one night and the service was great. The servers all chip in and help with each others tables and someone is constantly on the floor making rounds. The team works great together and ensures prompt service. Our server Hazel was great and was very welcoming. Highly recommended for some tapas and wine
4
Stopped here for late lunch in happy hour. Half price drinks were a bonus. Lovely service on the banks of the river in Clarke Quay. Usual 30 minute wait for freshly cooked paella. Worth the wait. A two person portion was perfect for us. Great way to spend an hour watching the world go by. Followed this up with bum boat ride. Very relaxing!
4
The restaurant is located on Clarke Quay. There was not many restaurants opened that afternoon. They offered select beers and cocktails at half price during happy hour. There was pre-set tappas choices and an a la carte menu. We ordered Paella for two. We were warned it would take about 40 minutes. We relaxed and enjoyed the nice surroundings and the boats going by. The Paella was very good. We were not rushed and enjoyed our Christmas afternoon very much
4
After work early dinner with the wife. Needed a buffer before the onslaught of our 3 boys. Thanks Octapas! You delivered. The food, drinks and music was just the medicine for a slow work Tuesday.
Salud! I'll be back!
2
the service was horrible, the tapas were sooooo tiny and expensive that four of us spent twice as much money as the previous week at another much tastier restaurant nearby. paella not great. skip this one and try another restaurant!
1
The title is a little unkind. Merely calling this place "terrible" is satisfactory after all they didn't ruin the wine - because someone else made it. I know it's a tourist joint and it's on the river but does this mean it has to be so bad?Start with the service. I know that the staff are all guest workers trying to make money for families at home, but the false smiles, the compete lack of attention and failure to follow through the smallest of requests is exceedingly irksome. I had 3 dishes: a meat plate which was below average and with bread that tasted like cardboard, stale and rock hard. There is no excuse now in Singapore for not having good quality bread. Next course was a dish of potatoes and chorizo. The chorizo had no flavor at all and the potatoes tasted as though reconstituted from powder. It all sat in about an inch of oil and was almost inedible. Final course was calamari that was so tough that you could have used it for the the tires on a Humvee. And to top it off the meal with 2 glasses of wine cost $130!This kind of restaurant makes a mockery of the claim that Singapore is city with a great food culture. My advise - walk straight past. Sadly it's the sort of place where no one ever goes again even if good so this review is unlikely to save people a terrible night. But one lives in hope...
3
We enjoyed our meal here. We had a round of tapas to start, and they were good. Then we shared a 2-person helping of paella amongst 4 people, and there were leftovers, so I am glad we didn't ask for the 4 person size. Drinks service wasn't great. We ordered 2 cocktails, but they only brought us one, so we shared it. Then we ordered 2 desserts for the children, and 2 glasses of wine for us parents. The brought the desserts, the kids ate them, I asked for the bill, and then when I was paying the wine arrived. Not ideal. I would have sent is back but I was thirst
1
I have never had this bad kind of tapas before.Normally it takes more then 5 minutes to make fresh tapas, but not here.Before we knew it, we had 6 different kind of tapas (all warm) within 10 minutes.The patatos weren't crispy, the chorizo was leathery, the meat wasn't medium baked.The only thing that was kind of good, were the chicken and ham croqeuttes and the Spanish omelette.Besides the bad tapas we both had stomach aches, within the hour!We paid $110 for this kind of food.Yesterday I had dinner at a local restaurant in Little India for $ 20. I would rather have given the $110 as a tip to them!!

The food was excellent. The staff is nice. They were a little slow, but they were also busy. The food and ambiance make up for it. By the way, stay for the band Deja Vu. They are fantastic and put on a great sho

Spanish cuisine is not something which i have tried in the past baring one or two dish. But my friends insisted on going here and have the famous paella. Phonetically its pronounced "Pie-a-ya". Paella is a Spanish dish made with rice, saffron, meat/shellfish/vegetables/many more options. It is traditionally cooked over an open fire in a round shallow pan with two handles called a ‘paella’ or a ‘paellera’. Tourists think of paella as a quintessentially Spanish dish – although you find it all over Spain, the Spanish think of it as a dish which is primarily Valencian.It is located in Clarke which comes alive in the night and is a great place to be. Ambience was great overlooking the river and the Paella was a delightful experience. Loved eveybit of it. Must try for all the vegetarian lovers as the dish did not disappoint me at all, infact i was happy i tried it
3
Nice location with mediocre food and service. I have not seen any of the waitresses even smile once. Their Tapas are nice but the Paella could be much better
4
With the high prices Singapore is known for, happy hours are always a welcomed pleasure. Add to that a relaxed atmosphere, a cool breeze and nice view from the Singapore river and Octapas is a place to visit. Their happy hour is half off of beers, house wines, and cocktails. When in the Clarke Quay area be sure to stop by
3
We found ourselves in Clark Quay at lunch time and there wasn't a lot of places open. Octapas caught our eye and we gave it a try. With just two of us, prices of the tapas added up quickly and really didn't fill us up for what we would have spent. If you are really set on tapas give it a try otherwise there's a bunch of other places in Clark Quay I would try first. Also Pallela was one of the things on the menu that looked good, but you need 30-40 minutes for them to prepare it and it has a minimum of two. Octapas would be smart to come up with some type of a lunch time special for two people
5
Have been here again, about 5 times since last review. Never disappointed- will come back as often as I can :)
1
I arrived Singapore and was expecting to see my fave band and singer. Sadly, I found out that the band had be transferred to other places. The new band was horrible. The music was too loud and I felt that I had wasted my time rushing down to meet the band. Any idea where did the old band relocated
2
Octapas Nice menu, good happy hour with half price beer and wine (makes Singapore booze prices barely tolerable). But I had a shrimp dish where the shrimp was totally flavorless. Like eating something with no taste. $16 bucks wasted! I'm glad I didn't try the seafood paella, may have been a bigger waste of money.
4
Very fast service, friendly waiter and waitress, food was delivered fast and hot and was tasty to boot. A little expensive for the tapas you get but they tasted delicious so we didn't mind. Sangria was great....what else can I say we had a nice evening eating here and would go again
2
We chose octapas as it was one of a few restaurants open in the afternoon. We chose 6 dishes of which 5 came out randomly over 10mins. The final dish didn't arrive until after our glasses had been taken & the waitress gave us our bill! They were most suprised when we didn't want it anymore, having finished our meal 15muns earlier.Afterwards we were both unwell and had to rush back to our hotel. One to avoid on Clarke quay
4
The selection of dishes without meat or fish was pretty limited but the food they served was well done. Though the Batatas Bravas were missing the zing unfortunately. The wine list was a nice surprise with a few OK drops - not comparable with the WineConnection but then this is Clarke Quay and not the more sophisticated Robertson Walk. We didn't have any issues with the service, friendly faces and attentive staff. Possibly a little too eager with - at times - 3 people serving the table at once.
5
I have been living in Singapore for 3 years, and know most of the good restaurants around. I come back to Octapas over and over again, I think almost every week. Food is excellent, staff is very friendly and pays attention if you need any service, and the band "Live Conclusion" playing cover music is actually better then the original artists in many of the songs.Excellent place for family dinner, out with the colleagues og business relations
4
One of the better food places in Clarke Quay area. I loved Octapas for its food, live music, service and ambience. Apart from indoor bar and tall seating (where the live band plays), there is also an outside seating area (adjoining the river). Once can choose based on time of day and mood.In food, Paella is a must try and so is the Erdinger Weiss Beer (big glass for a small price). The saute'd shrimps, potato wedges and calamari was also good. The Garlic Bread was the show stealer in food items, very well made.The live band starts playing around 9.30pm on a weekday. I personally did not like the choice of songs (too slow and monotonous for my taste, but maybe they pick up the tempo later).Overall worth the visi
3
Food was good but not amazing. Service was terrible, every time we ordered drinks one was forgotten. Waitresses couldn't even make the effort to smile and when a full glass of wine was accidentally spilt, the waitress gave us dirty looks while throwing some paper napkins at the puddle.
4
Been to this Spanish restaurant quite number of times and always had each visit a "couldn't get enough and always want to look for the opportunity to come back again" feelings every time I walked out the door...The foods are fabulous with the Negro Paella as my MUST- ORDER and one of my all time favorites.Several good taste beverages, yet, my choice has always been red sangria!!Love the atmosphere with live music entertainment indoor, or shall you prefer eating outside, they've got scenic view with plenty of lights during the evening by the river.Whenever I return to Singapore, this restaurant is a must - go place for me :
4
Food is ok and the drink menu is large, both average. What sets this place apart is the vocals if the female singer. She has a throaty, soulful voice, similar to Tina Turner. We were walking by, heard her singing and went straight in an sat down. She alone makes this place worth it
3
Food and atmosphere were great. However, the customer service was poor. Food was slow to arrive and six dishes ordered were delivered in a piecemeal fashion over 15 minutes! In addition, one of the dishes ordered never arrived even after reminding the waitress about its non-appearance! it would also have been nice if the waitress had generally paid more attention to our drinks needs and finished plates
3
The food was quite tasty although we had to wait over 40 minutes for dessert. When asked if we wanted more drinks the waitress laughed when I suggested they would be complementary untilI mentioned speaking to the manager. It is such a simple thing to give clients a free drink when they have been inconvenienced. It turns out we did get free drinks, but I don't know if it was worth the nearly hour wait for dessert with a small child. We won't be back.
4
On a recent business visit to Singapore, I paid a return visit to Octapas Spanish Tapas Bar in the Clark Quay, where I had been previously and had drinks and appetizers. The Clark Quay are of Singapore is a busy action packed area for tourists and visitors that are looking for a vibrant scene where you can eat drink and be entertained. Expect to pay more in this area as drinks can be expensive unless you’re smart enough to show up for happy hour.We were greeted by a friendly staff and encouraged to join their establishment for dinner and drinks. There is a great deal of businesses competing for business on the river front as you can imagine. Our request for seating by the river was cheerfully arranged and menus were given to us by the hostess. I ordered the vegetable bruschetta and chorizo to start with and others in our party ordered bacon wrapped shrimp as well. As I was waiting for our initial food to come to the table, I couldn’t help but notice how energetic and busy the staff was taking care of their guests as I was sitting in view of the outside bar. We received our food and was content for a while before ordering Paella Vallenciana for two as we over heard someone at the next table comment how good it was. I called the waitress to the table and she told me that it would take a half hour to cook and was in no hurry so I told her to place the order. We share the Paella and felt it was worth the wait.We were enjoying the evening and in no particular hurry, I continued to see a non-stop flow of the staff working diligently to serve a busy crowd. I remembered commenting to the group that I was with and they all agreed that the staff was attentive to the point that we thanked the assistant manager for a well trained staff.Before leaving Singapore, I stopped in again for drinks inside and to listen to the band “Life Conclusion”. The singer and band was good enough for me to take notice as I enjoyed there rendition of familiar contemporary songs. My experiences at Octopas will lead me to return on my next visit when in Singapore. Keep up the good job
5
Food and drinks are delicious. You have to go there when they have live performance (I think on Sat/Sun evenings after 10pm). The singer who usually performs there is simply the best! She sings so well that I will buy her CD if she's recording one.
2
All staff in this restaurant were clueless about their menu. The person taking the order required us to speak the complicated Spanish/Portuguese names for their dishes. So when I wanted "grilled beef with garlic" she made me point out the Spanish name. When the runner served the food he said "grilled beef with garlic" and had no idea about the Spanish names.Rice dishes (I think named Paella) were all too salty.One waitress served us complimentary ice-water while the other wanted to serve only Mineral water and refused ice water. So we called the other waitress and asked for a top-up, which we got.Poorly managed. Excellent location. Go sit there for the view and the ambiance but enjoy your bottled beer or a soft drink. Don't bother to eat
4
Octapas is at Clarke Quay with an indoor and outdoor area. Inside is quite pleasant and an appropriate decor, outside is certainly nice for an afternoon by the river and for some people watching.The food is pretty standard tapas fair with potatoes, mushrooms, meatballs, shrimp, fish etc all with a variety of sauces or marinades. Try the meatballs in tomato and the garlic mushrooms. They have other meals including paella so don't worry if you want something a little more substantial.The sangrea is also ok, although as previously mentioned in a couple of other reviews check the prices and they do half jugs. Clarke Quay is a tourist environment, certainly during the most days and evenings so be prepared to battle some crowds on weekends and early evenings. All in all a nice enough place if you feel like above average tapas in Singapore
2
I chose to sit at Octapas for it's mood and because I was not looking for a meal per se. Really looking for a snack, and this place looked perfect. One of the ladies gave us the menu, food and drinks. We chose some olives and shrimps with bacon.On the table there was an andvertisement saying there was a happy hour for Sangria, 50% off. There was no indication of prices. I searched for it on the drinks menu... nothing. Still I asked for a jar. The lady informed me that happy hour was already over. Well, even being in Singapore, being in a tourist area, I would never thought a jar of Sangria would be that expensive, so i ordered it anyway. The meal went well, arrived fast, the staff was really polite, the food and drinks were good, environment also. I payed (around 130 SGD) and took off, checking ou the area, completely distracted. Only when I got to the hotel I started thinking "well that was pretty expensive for tapas..." When I checked the bill ticket I realised that my jar of Sangria has the amazing proce of 65 SGD!! 65 dollars for a jar of sangria!!! And no, it was not a 50 litre jar!! I was completely amazed! Unfortunately I did not have time to go there and talk to the manegement. I probably should have asked for the price of the jar, but still I can't help feeling that there was some foul play in the mix. The Sangria is advertised, but no price is shown neither in the advertisement nor the menu. It kind of felt like a trap.So if tou go there make sure to ask prices on everything. It's the only way you don't get a good experience riuned when you check the bill!

When strolling through the area known as Clarke Quay in Singapore and wondering what to eat do not miss Octapas, strange though it may seem to choose Spanish cuisine in S.E. Asia you cannot go wrong in dining here. Remember to go between 5 and 6 p.m. to take advantage of the two for one bar offerings. Service is attentive albeit a tad slow. Ask for a table along side the river so as to enjoy the view and the passing boats and be certain to stay until nightfall when the lights in the area begin their dramatic display. Save room for dessert at one of the other restaurants in the area so as to sample their wares, and be certain to do a bit of sidewalk bar hopping throughout the area. Clarke Quay is a wonderful location to spend an evening
3
Visited the restaurant on weekend. The service is very slow It took 40 minutes to get our starters order the Lamb was very raw (We had requested well done) and not at all good even the bread was not done well. Billing took another 20 minutes after asking. I think if they rework on service staff and ensure they listen to customer it can be a excellent experience for any one looking for a nice place with good ambiance to eat.+vesLocationAmbiance of the place-vesEither too busy or rookie staffoverworked chef with very little attention to detail

Great vibe at night good location and friendly staff
Tapas were well priced and very tasty :) would def head back there again.

We enjoyed our tapas at this well located restaurant. The bacon-wrapped prawns,beef in garlic and meatballs were delicious. All washed down with a jug of Sangria.
4
This Tapas restaurant is set in a perfect location on Clarke Quay. During the day it is very pleasant place to eat, everything we ordered was well presented and tasted absolutely great. It is just the perfect way to watch the river boats go buy.night time is a totally different thing as the whole quay becomes very busy, especially on a Saturday night. Well worth the visit during the daytime
4
It's in Clarke Quay, so expect to pay a premium. However, it's easy to get carried away with : sitting outside, under the colored lit umbrellas, watching the water taxis floating up and down the river, gentle breeze, 2 minutes from the hotel...it couldn't get much better. It also has an airconditioned indoor section.The food was generally, very good...particularly the Beef Tapas with garlic, which melted in our mouths..outstanding!! Garlic prawns were nice, aubergines bruschetta were very good. Drinks were consistant with the area....great Singapore Sling The staff for us were attentive and happy.. but even happier when we pai
3
Live band was pumping. Bar style tables and stools, as well as normal restaurant set up inside and out. For Tapas the food was average to above average, especially the Garlic Mushrooms, Garlic Shrimp, Croquettes and Chorizo. Food service was slow, and the name sake dish Grilled Octapas was overcooked and tasteless. Also got charged for a dish we ordered, the kitchen forgot about and then we agreed to cancel. My own fault for not checking the bill more thoroughly. Staff friendly, not that attentative and food service was slow for Tapas. Has a great view Quay
4
We dined at Octapas twice during a recent trip to Singapore, conveniently located at Clark Quay.The food was excellent and service very good.Happy hour is from 5 to 8pm when you get 6 Tapas for the price of 4, which the waitress reminded of us frequently.When the bill arrived all 12 tapas were on the bill, they 'forgot' to provide 4 free tapas, when we pointed this out, they quickly removed the incorrect items on the bill.will definately go there again, but look at the bill very closely
4
Dropped into Octapas for a casual dinner. Had no complaints. The staff were friendly & engaging. We had mixed tapas to share which was a good appetiser. Lovely glasses of Sangria. Main was a really tasty serving of paella which easily fed 3 adults. Service was very polite & caring especially when we had one query re: some food. A quick response was to replace meal on the house. but it all worked out & we enjoyed our time @ Octapas. Thanks
4
We've been here several times on Sundays and have never been disappointed. Service had been invariably friendly and food unfailingly good. The spicy prawns, mushrooms, grilled squid and fish are excellent. We celebrated Mother's Day there and they even gave me a free sangria- what a nice touch! We look forward to returning.
1
Only thing going for it is the good location. However, staff provide poor service, ignore you, can't handle simple requests and generally don't care. Similar experience to the other negative reviews on this website: after wandering along Clarke Quays we were spoilt for choice and thought yes, why not this place. Sub standard tapas, it did dampen what was otherwise a good evening, but when you're paying overprice food surely that can't just be for location? Singapore standard of service is lower than I'd thought, esp compared with Malaysia, but this is a definite 'avoid'
2
Nice spot to while away the evening ,it is a shame the Tapas was a disappointment.The cold platter was a stand out of bland and boring, what a pity as that is the dish we were looking forward to with a cold beer and a sangria or two.How hard is it to do a platter?Obviously beyond this establishments ability.Dull and uninspiring food with little semblance to Spanish Tapas
3
Sumptous seafood cuisine. But a bit too pricey for its portions and location.
You'll have a long wait for your order. Friendly Filipino staff though.
4
It was nice sitting on the Clarke Quay. The prawns and the squid were delicious! So was the bruschetta :) BEWARE of the Sangria it will literally knock your socks off !!!
5
A great venue right on the river at Clarke Quay with a fabulous menu in tapas style with Spanish flavours and Singapore twists. Service was excellent also. Highly recommended.

Nice location but pretty average food, I understand they would have high rents but the prices are very expensive for what you get. If youre after a good feed don't come here.

After wandering around Clarke Quay tired and hungry and looking for somewhere - anywhere - to eat we found a table for 4 at Octapas (Turn right past the prostitutes hanging around the steps to the bridge). Overpriced, impersonal, average to uninspired run of the mill tapas. Suitable only for other tourists (like us) who are passing through once but will never return to this place

Stay away from this placed, i see now I'm not alone in the experience, but essentially from rude staff and poor service - i cannot understand how business continues for this place. After wandering around looking at options, we decided on this place as we thought we could get saome tapas or a main meal..... from the outset the waitress was not only rude but wouldn't pay attenion when ordering. we ordered the meat paella, after 40 mins chased it up - as we had not recieved (we had to ask the bus boy who was clearing tables as the waitress had not been passed in 20 mins) he came back to advise it was almost ready. On reciept it was seafood! we advised the waitress and she was like - no you ordered seafood! seriously we know what we ordered it was 1 dish and we don't eat seafood. Her response as - well i guess you want tapas now. No apologies, no discount, i even expected to get charged the Paella. They are in the right spot - but seriously if you can't do the basics get out of the business

I visited this restaurant on the 13 August 2012 and was greatly disappointed. After viewing the menu we decided that we would try the paella. Most of the paella contains seafood except for one dish which was a meat based dish. We order the meat based dish due to seafood allergies. The waitress came over to take our order however, she was busy paying attention to something else. When we ordered the paella she informed us that it would take 30mins. As we were hungry we ordered some bruschetta as well. When the brushetta arrived it was soggy and appeared to be a slice of bread with tomato juice drizzled on it. The bruschetta arrived fairly quickly. About 45 minutes after we placed the original order we had not seen the paella, we asked one of the waiters who said he will chase it up for us. Eventually the original waitress came back with the paella, she pulled the foil off and walked away. The paella they provided us was full of seafood and therefore couldn't be eaten. When we told her that this is not what we order as I was allergic to seafood, she went back to the kitchen and came back and suggested we order tapas. There was no apology or anthing. We decided to leave and were still provided with a full price bill. To give you an idea on price a glass of pepsi was $6.50 and a glass of sangria is $14. I do not mind paying these prices in the restaurant is worth it, however I suggest anyone thinking of visiting this place to reconsider the many other options available in Clarke Quay

Octapas is a spanish restaurant at Clark Quay. Take the train to Central Mall (Clark Quay Station) and walk to the bridge that connects between Riverwalk and Clark Quay. The restuarant is just next to the bridge entrance on your right.They offer a good range of tapas and drinks. Their Paella are delicious and comes in 2 sizes. The smaller version is just good for 2 to 3 persons and is reasonably priced.The service staff are generally friendly and attentive but not intruding. My friend and I had a leisure long dinner and throughout our meal, the staff did not subtly hint to chase us again. Instead, they were very accommodating and addressing to our every needs like topping up of our water, etc.I have visited the restaurant in 3 different occasions and the standard in terms of food and services remain constant. Thus, it is a good place to go if you want to have an enjoyable dinner

Clarke Quay is a bussing area of Singapoer in the evening and the Octapas is a great Tapas restaurant (if you like Tapas). The food was good as was the service and the price was resonable. They had a live band playing which added to the enjoyment. well worth a visit. P.S. the Tiger beer was a little pricey

I had to ask four times to two waitresses about the wifi password which couldn't connect anyway. The sangria we had was nice. The food were really good. We had a bacon-wrapped shrimp in salsa, soft tenderloin, ham croquette. The venue is quite small with a Spanish theme. The price was a bit expensive because it is in Clarke Quay. It was a good first experience but probably not a place I would invite people to.

Good selection of tapas with catalan flavours. They also had a live band play - might have been their first gig at this venue - they were brilliant and really added to the atmosphere.
2
If you want to pay $50 for a couple of beers and some cheese and chorizo, go for it.
Personally if I was the owner I would review prices for single walk up business people.

Located at the Clark Quay, Octapas has good selections of wines and cocktails. They have a good riverfront view that's perfect for reunion chats and a relaxing nighttime view of the Singapore River and a close distance to the bridge.

We have just dined in octopas for our final meal of our 2 week holiday and the cost of our drinks bill was totally and utterly out of this world (lesson learnt check the menu prior to ordering!!) We were prepared for the fact that it wasn't going to be cheap night but when the local tab Beer is $15 a pint and your drinks bill comes to just short of $300!! Let's just say you feel financially molested!!! The food was good and the ambiance was second to none - but really $15 for a local tap beer!!

Stopped for a bight to eat and a glass of wine. We had the ham platter but no chirizo available. Then had prawns wrapped in bacon, the bacon was crispy almost burnt I would say. Peepers stuffed with cod, my wife is still looking for the cod! Finally asked for a second of glass of red which never materialised which in retrospect is a good thing. I cannot thing of one plus point for this place

Found this place by 'mistake' and weren't we lucky. Situated at Clarke Quay and wandered in. Lovely food, many different choices. We had the meat and cheese platter, really tasty and bit pricey at $25S but worth it, Unfortunately they were out of chorizo (too many others choosing it) but still good, meatballs were sensational (good price too) and Sangria very tasty...Would definitely recommend this place, staff who served us friendly and helpful.Very enjoyable lunch

We came at a time, where nearly no customers were there, but still had to wait about 50 minutes for our Paella. They said in advance, that we had to wait, o.k., but I didn`t understand why it takes so long time for a Paella. At least the food was good and the service, too

We enjoy tapas and have enjoyed similar in other parts of the world. This was no exception, good food and service and not too pricey for Singapore (each tapas dish was around S$12-15). Loved the prawns and meatball dishes as well as the squid. Nice setting in Clark Quay, can be a tad humid in summer biut there is indoor seating also with air conditionin

My wife and I were looking for a restaurant that provided vegetarian options. We booked a table on the water's edge which was a great spot. We arrived early at 6 and were told that happy hour prices would be available on some drinks till 8 which made us very happy. We ordered a few glasses of Sangria which went down a treat although I did request no ice with my second as the first glass was half filled with ice.We ordered creamy braised mushrooms (our favourite), vegy toast (eggplant, tomato, onion), cheese croquettes, cod filled peppers and garlic bread. The food was full of flavour and portions were generous. We walked away very satisfied. The service was a bit slow particularly early on when there were few diners which is the only reason we scored our overall experience a 3. Had the service been good we would have rated our experience a 4

My husband and I had our Christmas Eve dinner at Octapas. We ordered their set meal for the night which consisted of turkey (for me) and lamb (for him), appetizer, some salad, strawberry cake, and white wine. We spent around $100 SG for the meal. It was good but not exactly extraordinary. It was also a bit expensive, but I guess it was the wine that made it pricey since a glass of the wine we had was priced at $15 SG in the menu. If you are craving for Spanish food, this is a good place. Its also a nice romantic spot by the river, however, the only view you will get is of the river and some hotels across the river.

Terrible Paella, poor service & expensive drinks.
Would not recommend, staff are inattentive and tableware was dirty.

Unbelievably expensive, poor food. Unfortunately we also suffered a bout of vomiting following our visit.

This Spanish restaurant in Clarke Quay in Singapore has the best Tapas and Seafood Paella I had in a very long time.
2
The tapas where basically ok but nothing special. The valencia paella at 40S$ for 2 pax was quite poor. Few pieces of small shrimps, 2 mussels and few pieces of squids chicken and pork well "hidden" in a very salty rice. The 50 minutes waiting time supposed to end up in something better. Been in the same place a year ago and it was much better
2
I have just come back from a visit to Octapas...my husband ordered bacon wrapped prawns and I ordered a greek salad...and yes we asked for water...The food was extremely average and while all other places in Singapore where we've dined gave tap water free, here we were served an evian...Of course we could have returned it but were just so tired after a day out that went ahead and paid for it..

I chose this restaurant for the atmosphere and proximity to my hotel. I knew going in that it wouldn't compare to tapas I had eaten in Spain but thought it would be fun to have some variety in my meals. Overall it wasn't too bad. I shared the toast with goat cheese and ham, the ham croquettes, the pork/beef meatballs and the chorizo. All of the dishes were decent and I especially enjoyed the croquettes. The service was average, not as good as some of the other restaurants in this area

Took a customer to eat there last week as we both decided we would like Paella. We had a few tapas dishes before hand which were mostly acceptable. The the paella came covered in foil. The rice was just a mush and so much of it was stuck to the bottom of the pan. I sent it back and they offered me a free tapas dish while I waited another 40 minutes for them to recook it. They did not admit it as totally over cooked and I refused to pay for it. Only after the manager came did they agree to remove it from the bill.A real disappointment, lots more choice in this area with much better food

This restaurant, just along the river/sea of Singapore, offered a big variety of tapas: fish and meat ones.We ate almost all of them, but we suggest you to try bread with cheese and ham, tomato bread, meat, octopus with potato and tortilla.We couldn't ever imaged to eat the real tapas in Singapore!!!Go there!!!

My husband, three young adult children and I really enjoyed our meal at Octapas. The food was so tasty and the wait staff were very friendly and joked around with us, making us feel very comfortable. The atmosphere at Clarke Quay is really great. Would definitely visit again if I find myself in Singapore

Used to be better when it was called Tapas Tree, seems like the same menu but the prices are about 25% higher and the food is more bland. Drinks are pretty good but overpriced for what you get. Last time I went on a Saturday evening, the music was so loud we couldn't hear each talk which made us skip dessert and move onto another place. Used to never be so loud and remember the inside seating area was fairly cozy. Bring back Tapas
