The wagyu rump is good and reasonably priced. Good for 3-4 person sharing. It is well cooked and almost melts in the mouth.

Been there multiple times on multiple occasions. The steak is consistently well cooked and the sides are good too. The lemon pepper chicken is pretty good too!

Meats galore. Ambience is good. Inside the shopping mall. For Good food ... look elsewhere. Lots of other food options available.

This is my first visit to isteaks. Food was so -so. Basically it's a canteen. No wall separating public walkway and interior. Saw someone has his backside facing the food of a diner. Very unhygienic and unappetizing.
Will never come here again.

Food is great - no way around that. Their beef and lamb are pretty good. Value for money! However, they need to improve on keeping the place clean and have a bit more customer service rather than a fast food joint like.

Visited yesterday, ordered Wagyu D-rump 1.2kg for 4pax at $99 including 4 side dishes due to the meat sample display at the chiller beside cashier counter which looked appetizing. Was expecting a decent steak since it is suppose to be the specialty. However, once when the steak was served on a board, I knew it was going to be tough (requested for medium). True enough, due to the thickness of 3cm, outside already overcooked (hard and dry totally not edible) so that inside is medium. Had problem even when cutting and jaw was tired and pain after chewing 3 small pieces. Perhaps that piece of meat was left in the fridge for quite sometime (not popular choice) and another cut would be better but however, proper advise should be given upon ordering. In the end even by forcing ourselves to chew but still could not finish. All of us left with great disappointment

For anyone who wishes to enjoy a nice steak with decent price, this may be a place to visit. Price range about $20 for NZ cuts but gets a bit more expensive if you decide to select USDA grade. They offer other food choices too but if you want to be there, it has to be for the steak. Overall, it has a casual ambience, self service order but food served to your table. Good that the restaurant employs the older folks and some mentally challenged servers. I would not complain about the service but compliment the management for opening their door to the under-privileged. So to those who complain about service, go take your money elsewhere and pay for the services, albeit not necessarily better steaks

Came here for the steak, saw the reviews, thought to myself this should be good. Comparable to Marche, bland and very tough. Taste is just average. Side dishes are also just okay, nothing fantastic. Ice lemon tea is good though a little too sweet. Won't be back a second time.

Good value steaks and western food in a casual environment. Not the best place to hold conversations as it can get noisy when the restaurant is full. Good service from wait staff especially the elderly uncle who always gives service with a smile. Such service is rare these days in fast paced Singapore

We are regulars as we find that meals at iSteaks represent VFM - Value for Money. Lately, however, management needs to pay attention to little details, particularly that meals, esp. soups, fries and meats are served hot, if not, at least warm !And the garlic bread, too. Nevertheless, service hasn't slipped so much as to merit a downgrade to 2 stars or even 3.....

I love the beef here! They do a mean steak, and at $20-ish, with 2 sides, this is one of the best places for steak in the area.

I had the regular meal thinking it would suffice but ended up getting like my stomach was not properly filled. My advice would be to mind the smaller portions and get something more substantial.

Tried their aged beef steak @ Serangoon Gardens a couple of times and they both tasted heavenly. Portions of sides are quite a lot too. Prices are reasonable for its quality. Will look forward to my next visit.

Love their Mushroom chicken ~ priced at $9 which comes with 2 complimentary side dishes (Mac and cheese, butter corn, onion rings) are my fav!
Love their ice lemon tea too!!!!!

Amazing steak house! Its great place to fill your steak craving at a low price. Drinks are cheap too, $1.50 for canned. I got ice kopi($1.80) and It is the best ice kopi I had. The same for the holland branch. Steak was great, try their country baked beans. It is phenomenal! Never tasted such a delicious baked beans

One of the better place to have a steak without bursting your wallet. Their meat was cook close enough to medium which is rare for Low Budget places and tender enough that you do not really need to chew much. Black pepper sauce is well done giving you the authentic black pepper taste. Other good dishes includes their chicken chop and deep fried chicken wings which are crispy and juicy. Have been eating here for quite some time now and it hasn't disappoint so far.

Tge 1.2 kg Wagyu 4/5 marbling eithb4 sides was good value for a family of 4, quite a treat actually.It may be rump and not Ribeye ...but who's complaining However, the management should try to manage table allocation and orders to avoid angst and hawker centre atmosphere of "chope-ing tables by staring down at diners or use of handkerchiefs or tissue paper..Lol

The steaks are good value for a simple dinner. You get a choice of 2 sides - the only side I won't order is the crunchy potato - it's crunchy because it's raw! The mac and cheese is a nice a compliment to your meal. I liked the seafood pasta and the fried chicken steak. You can ask for sauce on the side for your cream broccoli - I don't fancy the cream at all.I usually asked for my meat to be done really charred but still pink inside - between medium rare and medium. Medium is too well done for me but I'd sacrifice for a better charred piece

1.2kg Wagyu supplier issues! =(Went there twice specifically to get their 1.2kg wagyu (MBS3/4) for $85 and 4 sides. But both times, was told they were having supplier issues. If you want this, pls call ahead and confirm they have stock. In-lieu of that, I have been getting the NZ Ribeye 350g for $28 something. Not bad value, but want to try the wagyu! lol... Having said that, the first time it was cooked perfectly, but the second (last sunday) it was way over medium rare to medium well!! This is why they only score 3/5 average. (otherwise they would be a 4/5). So quality of cooking can really vary (and they were not packed out full!). This was also seen in the quality of the brussel sprouts side that i ordered both times - second time was better... lol.soft drinks (can) are $1.50 - if you can survive, buy it later from the supermarket in B1....

Good when in a budget. Great burgers, we have not tried the steaks but I can see they have the touch!! Can't wait to go back. We tried the pasta and way too much pepper flakes, overpowering!! The pasta could be good but they add like 5. Lbs of pepper flakes and dried chilies... Will not ask for the pasta again. Juices made fresh were great as well.. Will return for the burgers and steaks
