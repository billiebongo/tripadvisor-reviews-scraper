Our hotel recommended us The Blue Ginger. We had a very nice casual dining experience. Food and service was excellent.

Nice restaurant where booking is a must!. Food was excellent and we found the service to be very efficient and friendly. Decor is smart and understated. Definitely worth trying.
3
Nice restaurant and absolute good asian food. The staff was in a hurry and before we finished our entree the main course was already served. Halfway the main course they came to collect our plates. They were in a hurry. Again the food was good.

Really enjoyed this for local Malay/Chinese style food
Staff very attentive
Food was a great mix of meat and fish
Would highly recommend

I have visited the restaurant a few times but not in recent years. The food is still good and authentic but service is so so only. The Waiters and Waitresses don‚Äôt smile at all. It‚Äôs a little hot at the place we were seated. Hope they improve on the air conditioning

Set in an old shophouse and feeling very lived in as the restaurant's like a quiet oasis in a bustling city. Our family had lunch at the Blue Ginger and it was a fantastic culinary experience. First off, the food was tasty, fresh and authentic. We had Ngo Heong and Kueh Pie Tee as starters- Amazingly rich and strong flavours. Don't miss the Bakwan Kepeting soup and the deep-fried seabass. Durian Chendol was the lovely end for our lunch experience.The service was attentive and catered to our every whim. They made great suggestions on what to try. Superb! All up, just gorgeous from start to finish with Peranakan food at its finest

Tanjong Pagar Road provides a snapshot of the diverse food styles available in Singapore. For those keen on their food it should be a focus; Blue Ginger represents the best of Peranakan food in the street. We booked and although arriving a little early our host quickly took us to our table, offered us a cooling drink and presented the menu with some brief and helpful explanations. The restaurant is located in a traditional local building; the venue is quite plain, very clean and it is easy to re-arrange table settings to suit the clientele of the evening. The staff are mostly young, very pleasant and attentive; a combination that made for a most enjoyable meal. The food was very good; the menu offered an extensive range of traditional dishes. Peranakan food was not well known to us and the wait staff assisted us to choose a great variety of tasty dishes that suited our palates without destroying them. A delicate prawn dish, crab cake with bamboo, beef rendang, chicken and vegetables and Chendol with Durian for dessert completed a delightful meal that awoke all the senses. Prices were very reasonable

I have always been a fan of Nonya food.Blue Ginger is always my favourite Peranakan restaurant of all times, usually goes there twice or three times a month for business dinner, cos it never disappoints my palate no matter how many times I have patronise the restaurant. That goes to shows how much effort the chef had put in for consistency in the taste.From Starters, my favourite are Ngo Heong, Kueh pie tee, mouth-watering Udang Masak Assam Gulai, Beef Rendang, and sinfully Durian Chendol
3
If you are out of options and in the area, this is not a bad choice. The food is average with one or two highlights but generally the dishes taste tired and generic. We ordered 8 dishes and in all honesty, I couldn‚Äôt even recommend one to be truly memorable. However, none are bad either. Average cost is 35$ per head.

If you are around Tanjong Pagar/Chinatown area and would like to try local peranakan food, Blue Ginger Restaurant is a great place to try and it is highly recommended.In the 2017 Michelin Guide for Singapore, Blue Ginger Restaurant received ‚ÄúInspector's favourite for good value under SGD45‚Äù.We went there together with friend and family for Sunday lunch. To avoid disappointment, good to make reservations (especially if you are going in a big group) in advance as it is a popular place.You can either dine on the first floor or second floor. Atmosphere is nice and cosy for chit chatting. The staff are attentive and service is good.If you drive, you will need to parallel park along Tanjong Pagar Road but parking can be limited. There is a public carpark at Tanjong Pagar Plaza/Market and you will need to walk about 280m from carpark to Blue Ginger.We ordered Ayam/Chicken Bush Keluak, kueh Pie Tie, Fish Head Curry, Ngo Heong, Fried chicken/Ayam goreng, Roast chicken/Ayam Panggang, Beef rendang, Chilly Prawn/Udang Lada, fried bean curd/Tauhu Nyonya and Green Vegetables. The servings are of average size and we ordered 2 servings for several of the dishes.Must try dessert is the Durian Chendol. The dishes are flavorful, aromatic and not salty. All 11 of us enjoyed the lunch thoroughly. The average cost per head is about S$30-S$35 (after 15% discount). We were fortunate to enjoy 15% off total lunch¬†bill for all UOB Cards and promotion is valid till 31 Dec 2017. We will be back to try other dishes
5
Great food and service. Popular restaurant and you need to book. Great Asian and Thai food. Good service and very willing staff.
5
Friendly staff, great choice of local foods, would certainly recommend the beef curry. The meat was very ‚Äúmelt in the mouth‚Äù. Would certainly return next time I am passing.
5
Pretty good value curry bowls with good portions of fish. Handy for Chinatown (too much tourist tat, but worth a walk through for a bit of old Singapore)
4
Food is delicious and service is good. Great for family of 3-5. However, if you are in a big group, it can get quite pricey.
5
A comfortable environment that serve authentic Peranakan dishes. My favourite are the Curry Fish Head, Beef Rendang, Otak. Awesome meal ended with a bowl of Durian Cendol. Thumbs up.
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the fish head curry...outstanding
Beef rendano was tasty but a bit stodgy
Durian dessert was unique
3
I was recommended to try this place, and while it was perfectly ok, and didn't break the bank, I couldn't help thinking that I would have had a much better meal around the corner at the food market, at a fraction of the price. But it's fine if you want to sit and chat at a clean table with ok food
5
I visited this restaurant 5 years ago with friends. It was excellent then. I visited this time again and WOW fantastic. The Assam puteh soup was so nice (Â•ΩÈÆÆÔºâ„ÄÇWe also had the beef rendang and the nyayo fish head curry. So good served with white rice. No complaints to be had good servic
4
My first time to this restaurant and I was very pleased. I had the Ngo Heong as an appetizer and it was delicious. For a main course I had Ayam Buah Keluak, the chicken was good but it was the unique flavor of the kepayang nuts that truly made the dish unique. I'm not sure how to describe the flavor, but it definitely awakened some new taste buds in my mouth.The physical setting of the restaurant is nice; neither big or noisy. The staff was very prompt and friendly - very good service

Blue Ginger is known for peranakan cuisine, loosely, from a foreigner's perspective, Chinese cooking with Malay influence. This resto in Tanjong Pagar offers many Nyonya dishes - easy to enjoy even for first timers like me. I recommend the following based on our dinner the other night. - otak otak: fishcake with coconut milk and chili; a little spicy. But really good appetizer- vegetarian spring rolls - pork satay- beef rendang: tender pork cubes in coconut milk with lemongrass- nonya fish head curry: red snapper with okra and eggplant cooked in curry.For dessert, we had chendol, made of red beans and pandan jelly in fresh coconut milk and chilled sago. This was refreshing. The other version had a pur√©e of durian. Warning on this version - smell may cause you to lose appetite. But taste is fantastic. Our meal was taken with 2 bottles of red wine. I don't recommend though. The taste doesn't complement one another.
4
Good food, great assortment... lovely location ... good value. Really liked it. Will be back soon...

Service : good
Ambience: excellent
Food: Ordered ngoh hiang and curry fish head. Standard of ngoh hiang dropped. But the curry fish head was food. Meaty and the sauce is tasty.
3
Food is okay but the black nut chicken was not as good as expected. Prices are cheaper than that of ÁúüÂÆó.
4
We went there for dinner and ordered fish head curry, which was a large portion enough for the two of us and delicious. Nice small venue bordering Chinatown feeling cozy
5
Just great!!! Staff, Food, Service,
We will deffently be backüòÄüòÄ
Book table or just wait 30-45 min. (Time for A beer or drink at A bar)
2
We were seated on the second floor and the ambience was good. The food serving was really small. There were 8 of us and we ordered double portions of the mixedvegetable, rendang, prawns and buah keluak chickens and still left hungry. The food tasted mediocre for despite the price. Service is efficient but lacked dedication. Overall, not a place i would not return to for there are better Peranakan restaurants

It was a gathering to celebrate birthdays of two good friends. But it wasn't a memorable occasion, no thanks to The kitchen staff that decided to mechanically shave their ice right there in the dining room, causing a noisy racket.At one point, one of our guests wanted to use the bathroom and was told to go upstairs because the toilet downstairs was DIRTY! Not something one would expect from a fairly upmarket restaurant.And then there was the food. Mostly quite bland and unremarkable, most dishes were missing the punchy flavours we have come to expect of good traditional nyonya cuisine.Other than a quite succulent Ngor hiang and fragrant sambal prawn, most other dishes were poor. The otak-otak was hard and chewy, like fish cake. The Kueh Pai tee lacked flavor - you can find better versions in lots of hawker stalls. The Assam fish was bland and came in a tiny serving and at $36, it left me in disbelief. There were a few other dishes - Babi pongteh, sambal Brinjal, grilled chicken - that were just average. The only dish that could be called interesting was a squid keluak which wasn't overwhelmingly tasty but was unique.And finally the desserts. Just 3 selections, with Chendol being offered in 2 versions - with or without durian pur√©e. I had the one without, and it was so watered down by the shaved ice ( that was causing the noisy racket) - it truly was one of the WORST chendols I have ever had, anywhere...Suffice to say, I will never return to this restaurant, ever. There is so much better quality nyonya food in Singapore, in all kinds of setting. Blue Ginger surely rates as one of the least remarkable I have had
4
We had a group of 25 pax dining on second floor and the staffs are very cooperative The 48++ menu is very nice and enough for 5-6 hungry guys per table. From appetiser to dessert, what's missing is actually the rice or noodle. The main courses are packed with meat like the pork ngor hiong, beef rendang, ginger chicken, prawn, and fish. The ambience is also good for business dinner.

We tripped over the Blue Ginger one evening when we were searching for a light dinner near where we were staying. We thoroughly enjoyed the smoked duck salad, served over fresh alfalfa and bean sprouts, although the plum sauce was not evident. We then decided to split the house speciality, braised chicken with Indonesian black nuts. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the nuts were unlike any we have ever seen; both came together with a delectable sauce. We understand it can be difficult to get a reservation so we were fortunate to be seated without one!
1
We arrived there at 18:18, the sign showed "opened", but the door is closed. 2 waitresses saw us standing outside, but just ignored us and kept talking and laughing. We noticed that the opening hour starts from 18:30, but at least you can invite your customers to sit inside for a couple of minutes. We waited for 5 minutes, and the waitresses just kept launging inside. Finally, we just left.Êàë‰ª¨18:18Â∞±Âà∞‰∫ÜÔºåÊåÇÁâåÂÜôÁùÄËê•‰∏öÔºå‰ΩÜÊòØÈó®Êé®‰∏çÂºÄ„ÄÇÈáåÈù¢‰∏§‰∏™Â•≥ÊúçÂä°ÂëòÁúãÂà∞Êàë‰ª¨Â∞±ÂΩìÊ≤°ÁúãËßÅÔºåËøòÁªßÁª≠ËØ¥ËØ¥Á¨ëÁ¨ë„ÄÇËØ¥ËØùËøáÁ®ã‰∏≠Ëøò‰ºö‰∏çÊñ≠ÊíáÊàë‰ª¨‰∏§Áúº„ÄÇÂêéÊù•ÂèëÁé∞ÊòØ18:30Ê≠£ÂºèËê•‰∏öÔºå‰ΩÜÊòØÊääÈ°æÂÆ¢ËØ∑ËøõÈ§êÂéÖÂùê‰∏Ä‰∏ãÊòØÂ∫îËØ•ÁöÑÂêßÔºü‰Ω†‰ª¨ÂèàÊ≤°Âú®ÂøôÔºåÂè™ÊòØÁ∫ØËÅäÂ§©„ÄÇÊàë‰ª¨Âú®Èó®Â§ñÁúãÁùÄ‰ªñ‰ª¨ËØ¥ËØ¥Á¨ëÁ¨ë5ÂàÜÈíüÔºåÂèó‰∏ç‰∫ÜËµ∞‰∫Ü

Came in last minute for a fast meal. Menu looked awesome and there were too many good options to select. Portions weren't massively big, but very tasty! Very cozy surrounding, helpful staff and great food. What else to expect.
5
Be sure to try the prawns and the Sate Babi, different than the standard Lau Pasat fare. A treat! Very good and helpful service. I had forgotten something. They out of their way to get it back to me
5
We just returned from a 12 day tour of Northern India. We found our agent on here, as we were looking for a customized tour. My friend and I have traveled and I can honestly say it was nice experience. Nice food service !!!
5
We loved the unusual food. Service was very good, and the upstairs dining room is very attractive, with funky art.
4
Blue Ginger is probably the finest Pernakan restaurant in Singapore. Food is always consistently good. Some of the old favourites are the the rendang, prawns with tamarind, chicken with the unique sour nuts.
5
Got right in on a busy Saturday without reservation. Better be there at opening or have a reservation though on weekends! Lots of Nonya (Chinese/Malay) favorites here. Pretty little shop house near Tanjong Pagar MRT. The beef rendang is the best that we have found in Singapore. Need to to try the fishhead curry on the next round because everyone else in the restaurant was having it! The gula melaka the signature nonya dessert and is unusually good. These people know nonya

Visited this restaurant on 24th January 17 for dinner with my family.Had a reservation of 5 pax ending up with 6 pax due to an additional of VIP.A gentleman(in spectacle & pink shirt), told him i'd 6 pax instead of 5 pax RSVP.Bluntly told me straight to my face, only 5 pax don't have additional seat available.No choice, took a double squared table squeezing 6 pax considerable quite pack.Ordered ayam buah keluak, Asam Fish, Chap Chye Masak Titek, Sambal Terong Goreng, Nonya Roll.Ayam buah keluak not fresh and out of 3 nuts, 2 spoils.Asam Fish no taste as the asam gravy has no sour taste and spice. Fish also not fresh as we assume it's local breed and has mud smell and taste. The cost doesn't comes cheap with such a presentation and not worth having it.(I'm fine to fork out the cost as long as the dish are delicious)Other dishes are relatively acceptable with taste but compared to other local Nonya/Baba Restaurant, they are still far apart.For those who love ayam buah keluak and asam fish, this might not be the restaurant you would like to try.However, each person has different taste and liking.It's individual respects
1
Standards have gone waaay down here. The dishes on the menu sound great, but the reality was quite different. The dishes came quickly -- too quickly, probably microwaved! The beef rendang was a blob of greasy gravy with a couple of pieces of overcooked meat; the ayam buah keluak (which I had been looking forward to!) arrived with a stingy three nuts and overcooked chicken in a similarly greasy gravy. And the satay was just an affront - pieces of oily meat (they didn't even bother to skewer it) that bore no resemblance to satay whatsoever. Even the rice was lukewarm. Definitely no bibiks in the kitchen, and I suspect whoever was in there had never actually tasted Pernanakan cuisine. Oh, and way too expensive for what you got - SGD 18 for a tiny portion of ayam buah keluak? C'maaan. The service was competent, but nothing to write home about. Best part is the environment, which is still lovely, and Martin Loh's Peranakan watercolors on the walls
4
We had a family dinner here, during a 2 day stop over. They serve traditional Peranakan food, which is a fusion of Chinese, Malay & Indonesian cooking. The beef rendang (curry) was excellent, as was the fish head curry. Don't be put off by fish head, it's one large red snapper head, which has plenty of meat on it, and is enough for 2 people.It's worth booking, as this place gets very busy with locals and tourists.
4
Had dinner in the upstairs area for larger groups. We let the team help us choose good selection. The amount was perfect for the group, and modern take on local dishes. The wine list is limited to a house white and red but quite reasonable quality and a couple of beers as well. But the food is the main focus of the restaurant
4
Small and friendly great service and great food definitely worth a try and would recommend it. The starters were delicious and perfectly sized and great sharing mains. Don't ask me what I had - no idea but delicious
5
The food is typical, an experience, and pure enjoyment. A "must go to" place in SG. Very hospitable staff.
5
Would recommend the staff, very helpful in helping us choose what to eat. The food was very tasty and the service was excellent.
4
Small cozy place with 8-10 tables with attentive, courteous staff. Food was very tasty and in good-sized servings. Great for sharing. Truly enjoyed it
4
Blue Ginger is a good choice for Malay/Chinese cuisine. Located in an old shophouse, the restaurant serves solid quality food in a somewhat traditional surrounding. Try to get a table on the first floor.
5
Very good tasty delicious food. Small restaurant with a tradition. The restaurant is well known in Singapore and has a good reputation. We loved it very much and will return.
4
Good food for sharing with a group of people, colleagues or friends. Every dish we had was enjoyable but I particularly liked the otak otak and beef rendang. We had the private room upstairs which was great for a large group. Portions are reasonable, for a group of 12 people you will need to order about 3 portions of each starter and around 6 mains. Wines were around S$60-70 per bottle and they also serve beer.
4
Went here a "last night in town" treat and weren't disappointed. We made a reservation and it appears you do need to because it is popular. They were taking walk-ins on the night but a lot were turned away.We ordered a copule of staters and 2 amins plus a vegetable dish. The standout dishes were the Fish Head Curry based and the Ngo Heong(Minced pork and prawns seasoned with five-spice powder wrapped and fried to crispy golden brown). The Nonya Prawns were also good as was the seasonal vegetables especially the black mushrooms.As is the case in most restaurants here, the alcohol is expensive $SG12.50 for a small glass of house wine and $SG11 for a small Hoegaarden beer.The service was pretty good varying from indifferent to excellent.Treat yourself to this one, its pretty damn nice
4
Personally, I find it interesting to have the taste of the Perannakan dish at the famous THE BLUE GINGER restaurant. Better reserved for seats as saw many people and tourists waiting. For environment, a small but nicely decor space. The service was nice but the dishes needed to wait quite long (2 out of 4 we ordered). Food was nice and especially fit for people prefer strong favors. Especially I will recommend the curry fish head (for those not afraid of it) as it was surprisingly arrived in a big portion and nicely cooked with great taste. The nut chicken was also a special dish that I didn't find the similar taste in other chinese cusine, anyway, recommend a visit there
5
It's been some time since I was down Tanjong Pagar, but this little gem never fails to deliver, the flavours are subtle and authentic, fish head curry and beef rendang are definitely a must try. Service very attentive and all round a good night out with the tea
5
Lovely food, lovely place, great location. Not sure about parking? We had a business lunch and it was fabulous. We ordered family style so we can sample the menu.
Love to go back again :)
5
Right on the edge of Chinatown, small, intimate restaurant offers wonderful, authentic food. The service staff was excellent and offered great suggestions for a variety of tastes. The pickled vegetables on the table are to die for.
5
This unassuming restaurant is wonderful. Small, cool and inviting, the food was the most delicious we found on our travels in Singapore. The vegetarian choices, always critical for us, were varied and delicious. Fabulous
5
We reserved. Thank goodness we did. So busy but staff attentive and helpful. Service was quick but you weren't rushed. Food excellent and very different. I particularly liked the squid.
5
I visited with my wife and teenage children and we loved every dish and drink, but particularly the deep-fried eggplant, nonya rolls, otak otak and calamansi juice
5
We asked our concierge where we could try Peranaken cuisine, and he recommended Blue Ginger. You need to book to be sure of getting a table, which we did. It was well worth it! The flavours were quite unique, and most enjoyable. Best described as aromatic, spicy and tangy, the food assailed our senses. The service was excellent, and the menu reasonably priced
4
Traditional cuisine mixed Singaporian/Malaysian so very Original. Good selection, we were for a group dinner. Try all their recommendation. Rice was the poorest (it's plane and you use it like bread :-) but from bamboo appetizers to the chicken to the veggie's - excellent taste. It is a small place but offers a 1st floor with options for bigger groups. They have lovely wine and price/value ratio is very fair. Nothing fancy - if you are a global food lover you go there, if you are for fancy places, don't go there :-) very much loved the grilled/topped veggie and the chicken, the lowest score (beside the rice) I would give for the meat balls (beef) which were like in Switzerland - heavy and not sophisticated which you always expect in Singapore
4
I loved the atmosphere, service and more importantly the quality of the food served in this restaurant. We had house wine both red and white and found both of them are quite good ones in reasonable price. We asked not to save too spicy foods and they actually did right arrangements for us and we enjoyed their foods very well. Among the great foods, I highlight their steamed sea bass, which was definitely the best quality that I had ever before. Please try. Budget point of view, $60 per person will do for good dinner. „ÅäÂ∫ó„ÅÆÈõ∞Âõ≤Ê∞ó„ÇÇ„Åô„Åî„Åè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Çè„ÇÜ„Çã„Éö„É©„Éä„Ç´„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Ç§„É´„ÅßÂ§ßÂ§âËâØ„ÅÑ„É¨„Çπ„Éà„É©„É≥„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Éû„É¨„Éº„Çπ„Çø„Ç§„É´„ÅÆÊñôÁêÜ„ÅØÂ§ßÊ¶Ç„ÅÇ„Åæ„ÇäÊ¥óÁ∑¥„Åï„Çå„Å¶„Åä„Çâ„ÅöÁ©çÊ•µÁöÑ„Å´È£ü„Åπ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å®ÊÄù„Çè„Å™„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„Åß„Åô„Åå„ÄÅ„Åì„ÅÆ„ÅäÂ∫ó„ÅÆÊñôÁêÜ„ÅØ‰æã„Åà„Å∞„Ç™„Çø„Ç™„ÇøÔºë„Å§„Å®„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇ„Ç≠„ÉÅ„É≥„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÑ‰ªï‰∫ã„Åå„Å™„Åï„Çå„Å¶„Åä„Çä„ÄÅÂßã„ÇÅ„Å¶„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åì„Çå„ÇÇÁæéÂë≥„Åó„ÅÑ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Å†„Å™„ÄÅ„Å®ÊÄù„Çè„Åï„Çå„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Åæ„ÅüÁâπÁ≠Ü„Åô„Åπ„Åç„ÅØËí∏„Åó„Åü„Çπ„Ç∫„Ç≠„ÅÆ‰∏ÄÁöø„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇÁ¥†Êô¥„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ‰∏ÄÁöø„ÅßÊòØÈùû„Åæ„ÅüÈ£ü„Åπ„Å´Êù•„Åü„ÅÑ„Å®ÊÄù„Çè„Åï„Çå„ÇãÊñôÁêÜ„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„Ç™„Çπ„Çπ„É°„Åó„Åæ„Åô

Singaporean food is easy to find at the Hawker stands but not so easy to find in a nice sit down restaurant. Blue Ginger is one of the few restaurants that specialises in traditional Singaporean cuisine. The Beef Rendang was outstanding. Reservations a few days ahead are a must
4
I really like this cuisine, and was pleased we ordered the Fish Head Curry, but disappointed with the Beef Rendang. Normally a favourite of mine so perhaps had too high expectations; the flavour was just about OK but it simply had not been cooked for long enough to soften some pretty tough meat! Service and decor was all fine
4
Food is great, really authentic. Dining environment is great - clean and neat. I've been here twice and each time I've felt that the wait staff could use a little more smile and friendliness. Other than that, no complaints.
4
mixing chinese and malay food, tasted a bit close to indonesian; anyway food good quality and quite good
3
It is widely listed in guidebooks but I found the Blue Ginger restaurant to be rather ordinary. There are far better restaurants in Singapore. Maybe it was an off night. The atmosphere is nice though, and the service friendly. But the food was unmemorable.
4
A small group of us had dinner here recently and thoroughly enjoyed trying the Peranakan specialties. Starters were otak otak and spring rolls followed by beef rendang, ayam buah keluak, sambal terong goreng and udang nonya.
4
wanted to try real peranakan food... we had a few choices, and almost all our choices needed reservations in advance. so we rolled the dice and made reservations at the blue ginger restaurant. we had a vague idea of what we wanted to try but generally needed help from the wait staff... and they were very happy to oblige. amazing food! ngo heong to start... sotong juhu kangkong, ayam buah keluak, and ikan masak assam gulai for the mains... flavors were unique and bold... went very well with heaps of plain rice... we could have gone more exotic with our menu items, but our "safe" choices proved to be really good.and i haven't even mentioned dessert! durian chendol and soursop sago in coconut milk with calamansi! i used to have these flavors individually when i was growing up in asia... but these combinations were just out of this world! will need to go back when i can
2
We had dinner last night at this over rated restaurant that has great reviews. Both my husband and I were disappointed with the food. We had pie tee and Ngo Hiong for starters. Not bad but nothing spectacular. For mains we had their famous curry fish head (I've had better elsewhere), stewed pork, prawn dish, morning glory with sweet potatoes. None of those stood out as 'wow'. I did however enjoyed their durian chendoi which I had 2 servings. Don't think we will revisit if we are not invited by friends or relatives to have dinner there.
4
Had dinner here the other night. Managed to get seated as walk in which was great as we had heard the place can be booked up in advance. Menu is great, lot of traditional options. We mixed up with some meat and vegetable dishes. Flavours really come out with the Peranakan cooking style. Service was good with pleasant and attentive staff. All in all a good experience
5
First read about this restaurant in a NZ paper 14 years ago just before visiting Singapore. We ate there and loved the food - the variety of tastes and ingredients used. Presentation was great. We returned there with family members last week and found the place hadn't changed. The food was an excellent mix of Peranakan dishes which tasted great. The service was efficient and friendly. The restaurant was as busy as ever and a reservation is essential to ensure getting a table
4
Been patronizing them for 20 years. This visit the portions seemed bigger (e.g. the curry vegetables and the chendol); but less authentic. Chendol seemed to have some kind of canned coconut creme. Biggest disappointment is a fried fish with sambal chili dish - avoid at all cost. Fried hard pieces of local fish that's dappled with standard chili that's available as a condiment. Had a Ayam Bulauk Sotong dish that is new - interesting, tasted good, but very oily. My American friend didn't seem to like the food, I found it a tad lower than my normal expectations. On an up note, price is very reasonable (considering inflation over the years) and service was good.Still a good place for a tourist to try Peranakan food in a nice setting, and I would recommend it, to try at least once when you are in Singapore
3
From the street this looks like a small restaurant and indeed the ground floor is small and cosy with a bit of atmosphere. There are bigger areas upstairs. The menu provides a reasonable choice, service is quite quick and our waitress was happy and cheerful. Our food was good, although I always wish I'd asked for the prawns to be shelled to avoid the mess! Worth a visit but not outstanding
4
Had my lunch with colleagues at blue ginger yesterday. It was good experience. Eggplant was excellent and a must try.
5
We were sitting at the 2d floor. Very nice colonial looking room with simple beautiful deco . Nice wine selection. Delightful cuisine which makes you love the Peranakan subtile food though medium hot without any excess.
5
We hosted a group of friends for my birthday dinner. The food and service were outstanding. We had a private room on the third floor. They were able to accommodate food preferences and allergies and still make every dish delicious.
4
My wife and I went for Saturday night dinner. We were expecting a bit more upscale environment based on the website. I thInk second and third floors probably had better atmosphere. Ground floor is very close quarters with neighboring tables and not much ambiance. Regardless, food was very good, service was excellent especially by Singapore standards. You can bring your own wine for corkage charge. Eggplant was amazing, shrimp with sambal chili was fabulous, mackerel just ok. Park at Orchid Hotel. Also coupon street parking and lots nearby. Can't go wrong eating here
4
My husband and I had our anniversary dinner there last night. The first floor was very casual. I was told 2nd and 3rd floors were for bigger groups, but for special dinner, ask if you can sit up stairs.The food was good. The fried eggplants came with sambal chili sauce and was delicious. I ordered shrimp in tamarind sauce and my husband ordered fish in the same sauce, as we found out. Both were good, but not outstanding. Next time, I would try and order dishes prepared differently. The service was very good. We didn't have to wait long for anything. The decor was also pleasant.This is a good place to have quick, sit down and moderately priced Peranankan food
4
There were 7 of us, including 3 foreigners. Otak Otak was moist and flavourful. I enjoyed the prawn dish too but unfortunately I do not remember which one. I generally do not care for springrolls and buah keluak but both the Vegetarian Spring Rolls and Ayam Buah Keluak were good. My friends raved about the sotong dish, but squid is something I avoid studiously. Desserts were great. I refused to try the Durian Chendol but the Chendol and Gula Melaka were good - I saw the American roll his eyes back in heavenly bliss and the Korean liked them too. Our party of 7 spent over $200, including lou hei with fresh salmon

A friend and I visited this restaurant for the first time last night. We really enjoyed the whole experience.We started with olak olak and duck salad. Both entrees were fresh and tasty, and a great start to the meal.For mains we over-ordered; we didn't realise that the fish was a whole flounder which came with a tamarind crust.We also had the eggplant with sambal and the Blue Ginger chicken. All the dishes were excellent, as were the side of pickled vegetables.Yes, it's expensive compared to the local hawker stalls, but my friend and I were happy to pay the bill. It was a great meal

Unlike many restaurants, over the years The Blue Ginger has been remarkably consistent in the quality of its Nyonya cooking. This last visit was no exception. What is particularly appealing is the wide variety of tastes on offer. The restaurant has one fairly small room downstairs and a slightly bigger one of the first floor. So booking is always advisable. Among the best dishes are their Ayam Panggang Blue Ginger, which consists of grilled chicken in coconut milk with a stunningly delicate-flavoured sauce. Their Nyonya Fish Head Curry is worth the visit alone. However for us what always stands out is their Juhu Kangkong, which is a well-prepared kangkong in sambal, but with dried cuttlefish, which works amazingly well. If you like Nyonya cuisine, it would be a great shame not to visit here at least once

We went there during CNY period for department lunch. I don't really like eating Lou sang/Lou hei, but I've tried food one before, this is just normal.We ordered beef rendang, beef was tender & juicy, gravy is a bit too mild, if it can be thicker or less water will be good. Zap chai & achar both are good. Achar very appetizing, zap chai taste very good to go with rice. We had ngo heong/mince pork rolls, juicy and tasty. Fried chicken with gravy, chicken is rather plain but sauce is very good with sambal shrimps. We had sambal prawns, fresh prawns, gravy similar with the chicken one. We had also duck and pork soup, the pork was rather too strong, the vegetables can be slightly overpowered the lard. Not everyone will like it.Dessert, we had sago & gula malaca (brown sugar), censor. Both are equally good, gula malacca is just slightly too sweet if you like sweet, that's fine

I discovered this restaurant when looking online for a nice place to eat in Singapore. We were looking for something local and authentic and did not want to eat at the American owned chain hotel where we were staying. The Blue Ginger was absolutely delicious. We both had fish and it was prepared with an excellent medley of spices. The fish was incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection. I will return here when I am next in Singapore
4
An address recommended by locals as well as reliable city guides is worth trying: great authentic nonya food in an understated cosy restaurant with beautiful interior design details and very friendly and professional staff. Intriguing and delicious desserts as well.

We hired private room for birthday celebration. 13 course feast. Exceptional service and food. Highly recommend

Wonderful pernakan cuisine amidst the plethora of eateries dotting Tanjong Pagar. The food is zesty, with full flavours of the mixed Malay and Chinese styles of cooking and the igredients especially the sea food is fresh. They have wonderful laksas and cuttlefish preparations. The restaurant is a bit cramped for space though and you have to climb a flight of steep stairs to reach the family sitting area on first floor. The food though makes up for that trouble

Friends who live in Singapore suggested we meet here for lunch on a Sunday. We let them choose the food, which is served family style. We had the special chicken (it's small bone-in pieces were a lot smaller than I was expecting) but it was delicious. We had some kind of special stuffed nuts that are apparently very labor intensive to make and they were delicious too. The seasonal green vegetable was sauteed and had a few mushroom pieces sprinkled over it. The rice was fluffy. The two other dishes we had were good but not memorable as to what they were. Wine is about $15 a glass, which is standard in touristy areas but this area of Singapore isn't terribly touristy. The wait staff was nice. I"d go here again with friends.

Blue ginger is a quaint little restaurant tucked away from the major touristy areas. The service was quick and friendly. We had been told about blue ginger from a local colleague so we decided to check it out. The food was flavorful and actually Singapore style (can't remember the correct name for it). Most other food in Singapore is fully derived from other cultures (Chinese, Malaysian, etc) but Blue Ginger was a true taste of Singapore.
4
We came here through lonely planet and do not regret it. We ordered: appetizer - duck salad. For mains, squid with tumeric and fish head in curry. Duck salad - Four thin and small pieces of duck and that's about it. Not so much a salad but only one type of green and four smallpieces of duck. 2/5Squid with tumeric (forgot the name) - Fantastic. The sauce was perfect, the squid was not chewy, and the taste was amazing. 5/5Fish head curry - We literally left only bones. This dish is huge ! Seriously. Curry sauce is nothing short of perfect, the fish fell apart like butter, the veggies were spot on. This is my personal favorite, although my girlfriend thinks it's a tie. Value - Our meal was a total of $130. It's not cheap. If your are looking for cheap, I would suggest to stick with the hawkers, if you can afford it, this place is worth it. The food is just great. Not much ambiance or art to look at, but food speaks for itself.
3
Firstly the decor in this restaurant is plain and minimalist. The service was very quick (from arrival, a 2 course meal with drinks over and done with in 45mins) and the waitress spoke poor English which is unusual in Singapore. We had difficulty in making our order understood. The main course arrived before we had finished the first course. The meal was specialised Peranakan and had very different flavours to Chinese, Indian or Thai food. For starters we had prawn and minced pork fried rolls which were very tasty. Afterwards we had braised chicken with large black nuts which had to scooped out to eat, the sauce was black too. It tasted ok but didn't look to appetising. Interesting and different! We had one glass of wine and one beer and the bill came to S$102 about √Ç¬£51 for 2 of us. Unlike the last reviewer I did not think the ambiance was of note, in fact we were not there long enough to notice
5
excellent ambiance, great peranakan food, good blend of malaysian/chinese cuisine. rated highly in my friend's lonely planet guidebook so we decided to give it a try. tanjong pagar is a very cute area and this is located on the main road, small in size but has character. menus/artwork are beautifully decorated. went with my husband and friend on weekday, all of us enjoyed the food (called for reservations). our picks: appetizers: Nonya Roll, deep fried, but still light for a starter. chicken dish: Ayam Buah Keluak, really yummy braised chicken seasoned with turmeric, galangal and lemongrass cooked with Indonesian black nuts (loved this one). vegetable: Sambal Bendy Ladies fingers in a hot and spicy shrimp paste--good, but not great. seafood: Steamed Seabass / Cod, very tender/ light/ scrumptious. loved going here for dinner
4
Blue Ginger stands out on Tanjong Pagar Road by virtue of not being a Korean BBQ restaurant. Instead it serves high quality Peranakan food in pleasant surroundings. Average prices for mid-level Singaporean restaurant. The beef rendang and sago dessert were particularly good. Restaurant is only small so a reservation is probably advisable
5
I like Peranakan food. The Old China Cafe in KL is a favourite place to eat, reliably good and atmospheric in a way few Malaysian restaurants seem to be. But it's a few steps behind Blue Ginger.I wouldn't say absolutely everything was perfect about the Blue Ginger. One of our dishes was forgotten and we all ended up drinking water because they had neither of the non alcoholic drinks on the menu we fancied. And we did happen to go there on an evening when both adjacent tables were rather drunkenly loud - but that's hardly the restaurant's fault.I thought it scored in the execution of the dishes we ate - the otak otak in particular was really tasty and light, rather than the slightly clammy, oily and dense stuff that normally comes wrapped in banana leaf. The fish head curry was wonderful. The pietee were dead tasty, the duck salad not obviously nonya but a good contrast of tastes and textures and the ayam buah keluak something new and unfamiliar - chicken cooked with Indonesian black nuts.The bill came to around 30SGD each which, given the quality of the food, seemed something of a bargain
4
Great alternative to ubiquitous Chinese street food fond all over the City. A sty and spicy - worth checking out but not that cheap!

I first went to the blue ginger a couple of years ago. It was not a standout then and it was unlikely I would've returned, except that my friends in Singapore wanted to try it. Tonight the food was simply boring, nothing special and overpriced. I'm not sure why this restaurant gets pretty good reviews here. With so many great restaurants in Singapore, and just fantastic Hawker center food choices, I simply cannot recommend Blue Ginger.
3
It's a reliable place to go to for peranakan food but portions are small (but that's quite the norm for peranakan food). It was a long time since I have been, mainly because for the portions and the food quality, it's expensive in my books. There are other places I'd rather go to. But this was convenient in town
5
I have been in this restaurant at least 4 times and it has never been disappointing.The flavours are strong but not too much, the food is good with a nice balance of flavours. I had tried different dishes and loved all of them.Among vegetables dishes, the one with eggplants is my favourite. Love the small fried rolls for starter. Will come back for sure!
5
We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the Blue Ginger in Singapore. The complex Peranakan flavours were very well executed. We struggled to limit our selection and consequently over indulged. The beef rendang was one of the best I've tasted, the sambal terong goreg (wonderful eggplant covered in a wonderful fresh chilli paste and sweet soy) was divine, and the tenderness of the sting ray in peppery sauce pleasantly surprised. The service was good and discreet, the location accessible and only a minute away from a wonderful cocktail bar...but that's another story. The Blue Ginger deserves a repeat visit
5
Given that Singapore is such a foodie town on so many levels, I know this is a big statement. But for me, Blue Ginger has the winning combination of delicious food, interesting & unique flavours, nice atmosphere, great location and reasonable prices. I don‚Äôt know how other people can say it is overpriced because the food quality, presentation, refinement of flavour and certainly the atmosphere are very different that at the hawker centres. This is lovely restored heritage building, which can be loud but it feels lively & it is small enough that the noise isn‚Äôt too bad. I always take visitors here because most haven‚Äôt eaten Peranakan food before, and that is a real shame (I also recommend a visit to the Peranakan Museum as well if you have time ‚Äì fascinating!). I have had almost everything on the menu (well not the meat because I don‚Äôt eat that) and haven‚Äôt had a ‚Äòmiss‚Äô. My favourites are the otak otak, kuey pie tee, curry vegetables, kangkong lemak and mackerel in tamarind gravy. Okay getting hungry now! Make a booking so you are not disappointed (but if you can‚Äôt get in, the nearby restaurant Whole Earth is worth a try)

In my every visit to Singapore, I had tried to book a table herr, but I never suceeded. That might somewhat explain how popular the restaurant is among both locals and tourists.I finally succeeded in my reservation this time. The food was really good. Everything was seasoned with several spices, but to the right extent. We had chicken, beef and pork; we generally liked everything served. What impressed me the most was the dessert: iced coconut milk sago. I had never had anything better before!Really recommend Blue Ginger if you would like to try Nyonya cuisines
4
Very good standard of service and excellent food. I highly recommend the spring rolls as a starter to share, the waiting staff will offer rice and pickles at a surcharge, the pickles are incredibly tasty but not for the faint of heart (or mild of pallet!) And there is a good choice of main dishes with vegetarian options
5
Then this place offers something a lot better! Peranakan cuisine is the result of Chinese merchants finding Malaysian wives. This was my first taste of this kind of food - but I will come back for more:) The restaurant is modest. The service is excellent. But it is the food that makes it something special. The fusion of Chinese and Malay food is great and you leave with a completely different feeling of satisfaction than if you visit one of the run-of-the-mill tourist places with a river view
3
The best nyonya food ? This is the first nyonya restaurant, I tried in SG, Compared with other nyonya restaurants I tried in non-SG, this one seems the worst one. The food is too spicy and the taste isn't delicious. However, their drink, sparking lemon grass is very good. Must try
2
Food is kind of ok, but you get better value in any hawkers center. Especially drinks are just ridiculously overpriced.
4
My friends and I really enjoy eating at this restaurant. The taste of their food is nice, strong flavour but not too hot and spicy for asian.
5
Blue Ginger serves Peranakan food and it is authentic and delicious. It was my family's favorite meal we had in singapore probably because of how authentic it was. Each dish was very good and the service was quick.
3
Having enjoyed Nonya food in Sydney, we searched it out in it's Singapore home and found the Blue Ginger. I was looking for delightful, light, artistic, cuisine, but the sauces were heavy, the chicken and prawns overcooked. It was a fair enough deal at $100 for two without grog, but the service was the best part of the meal.
4
Found this restaurant while walking on the outskirts of Chinatown.It's a peaceful oasis after the hectic hustle & bustle down the road.Atmosphere is calm & classy and the service was fast with good attention to detail.As for the food, great presentation and all our dishes were of a high quality..We had all vegetarian dishes, spring rolls, eggplant with chillies, vegetable tempura, , agedashi tofu and rice.Very satisfied after leaving and will come back here. But it is a little pricey
2
I have eaten the at the nonya restaurant at the esplanade and at the star. this blue ginger is nothing spectacular. what irks me was I was shouting at my friend throughout the dinner simply because I sat beside a group of hongkongers. I couldn't hear what I was saying myself and the walls seen to echo a lo

This is the 3rd time I've been to Blue Ginger, though the last time was over 3 years ago. Situated in Tanjong Pagar Rd, in a quaint row of small restaurants, bars and, oddly, wedding dress shops, it's relatively easy to get to by bus, train or cab. It still has very good service, a decent wine selection of reasonable prices and, most importantly, excellent Peranakan cuisine.We started with duck salad (so so) and otak-otak (better). They also gave complementary achar, a pickled vegetable concoction (also known as achara in other southeast Asian countries), which was really exquisite such that we kept asking for more. Our mains were the beef rendang (delicious and tender), seabass nonya (good) and ayam pangang (really tasty and tender roasted chicken). We also had tauhu nonya (tofu - very good), terong (a spicy eggplant dish) and of course steamed rice. We were only 4 of us but we wiped it all out.We topped it up with some es chendol (an icy dessert) which was a good ending to a great meal.We had a very good Napa Valley merlot to go with the meal as well, which was quite good.Service was attentiv
4
Was told that this restaurant serves decent Peranakan cuisine. A few of my colleagues and I decided to give ourselves a treat. We were not at all disappointed .The highlight for me was the Babi Pong Tay, Ayam Buah Keluak and the Nonya Fish Head Curry. Service was decent and overall value decent.Would go back there agai
2
We were quite disappointed by this restaurant. We spent 100SGD for three plates, a beer and a tea. Portions were also quite small and the place itself is nothing special. You can have much better food of this kind in the street for a third of the price
3
I held a small wedding reception here 5 years ago in this quaint little restaurant. Food was very good and the wait staff were friendly and helpful. Visiting this restaurant again after all these years, I can't help but feel a little let down. My main disappointment was with a senior staff that decided it was ok to argue with a customer. I've never been rude in public nor ever raised my voice at service staff but this occasion was the first time I've ever popped a vein. The waiter got my friend's order wrong but insisted it was our mistake. A simple apology would have sufficed but the waiter decided it was ok to insist. Very annoying. Service was generally slow because they were short handed. Food was still good but I thought the quality has slid somewhat compared to 6 years ago. I was a regular customer but most likely never going back again. Still, if you are in the vicinity and looking to be introduced to Peranakan cuisine, this restaurant will suffice. Quirky interior makes for good picture opportunities too.
4
Small restaurant specialising in parnatican food. Lots of goos flavours. Attentive staff, well worth a visit
4
Malaysian / Chinese cuisine, very nice food. Some westerners may find it a bit too exotic but I enjoyed it all, even the dessert which was sticky rice pudding (warm sweet rice with a type of plum sauce) - don't be scared to go local!
4
The food here is amazing. The rendang was a highlight for me, and that yummy sticky black rice. Nice d√©cor and the service was lovely. Gosh. Will be back on my next visit to Singapore. Highly recommend.
5
This is one of the better panarakan resturant around, however be warned, the food ain't cheap and the portion are normal asian size. Quality is more important than quantity.Try out the kuay pie tee, its a cute little starter which can be ate in a mouthful. But its flavourful and really authentic.Dishes will be served with rice and balachan chilli and pickled vegetables, which is appetising. The dishes are all delicious and well made. Limited sitting as mentioned a lot, there is only like less then 20 tables. So do make a reservation to avoid disappointment
2
This is supposedly one of the best Peranakan restaurants in town but seriously?! I have had better. The dishes are in very small portions for the high prices they charge and their taste not as flavourful as anticipated. Nothing else worth mentioning expect that this place is almost always full so you need a reservation. Not worth the effort
3
Make sure to make reservations, we watched people get turned away without them. The food here is good and we enjoyed our entrees. I had the beef rendang and my husband had the steamed fish prepared on the spicy side with the ginger and lemongrass sauce. We also ordered a side of vegetables, Chap Chye Masak Titek, which did not suit our pallets. The place is clean and the staff is friendly, if you are in the area of Chinatown give it a whirl, but don't make a special trip
4
We went there in june and the food was rather nice. Some of us had the blue ginger chicken which was ok but the beef rendang is very nice. I would recommend to eat there and go to the fruit market (1min walk) to eat fresh fruit as dessert
4
It was my first but wonderful experience for a luncheon with friends at The Blue Ginger. An intimate interior..I appreciate the excellent customer service when I emailed in regards to food allergy concerns and reservations. A good variety on the menu. Portions were rather small but the taste was lovely.Beef rendang was cooked to the right taste, the duck salad was tasty. I like their in-house Blue Ginger chicken. Yum! Love the fizzy drink lemongrass and the dessert. I'm usually not a fan of Asian desserts but the gula melaka won my heart. My friend felt that there are other places who serve more authentic Peranakan food but I will definitely go again
4
we had a really enjoyable experience. The set up appears as though a family is taking care of you in their dining room. attentive and informative waiter who took all the time we needed to build our orders so we could get a good sampling. The most important order is to get a dish with the black nuts. We had a chicken and a squid dish with them. It is really different and very savory. The dishes took a little time to arrive but not too late
3
Having eaten at The Blue Ginger about six years ago, I decided to try it again because my first experience was enjoyable. This time just disappointment; I should have known this would be the case based on the email response I received upon making a change in my on-line reservation. Rather than responding that the staff looked forward to seeing me and that all would be in order when I arrived, the response was one word "noted". How welcoming is that? I thought it strange at the time.Upon arrival and I guess was the Manager (it turned out to be) asked if we had a reservation to which I responded positively. He then pointed to a table which I assumed he meant was for us never saying welcome or much of anything else. The one thing that is so obvious, at least on the evening I was there, is that none of the staff smiles except one gal .. thankfully she served us off and on that evening.The ambiance is tired and seems not to have been redone since my last visit ... tired!! Be aware that The Blue Ginger serves Peranakan food which frankly is just ordinary and better elsewhere. They charge for rice and sambal S$2.50. My beef rendang came out luke warm and I asked it be heated up ... the waitress gave my returned dish to the non-verbal Manager who looked over at me as if to say "I cannot believe this". I just waved.Take your money and spend your time at a place that will appreciate the fact you are there. Kent Maur
5
The good is great, very original, chef's speciality is definitely recommended and you will find quite a few dishes on the menu with that sign. Reservation is a must as its a small restaurant, always fully booked. Medium range price.
5
My favorite restaurant in Singapore, and that is saying something, superb Paranakan cuisine in a wonderful old shophouse. On the edge of Chinatown, nice neighborhood, friendly waitstaff, superb menu, book well in advancd, and try to sit on the upstairs balcony.
2
Rushed in without looking at nearby alternatives. Didn't really like any of the dishes except for maybe the soup. Wine by the glass was a bit like petrol. Bottle left open too long I think. Just not the place for us.
4
Went there for lunch with the DH who works in the CBD. It was a short, pleasant walk and even without reservations we were seated right away. We sat right under an AC unit, which made me freeze, but next time I'll bring a sweater. We tried 3-4 things and they all seemed well-executed. Did not particularly enjoy any of them, but I think that was more to do with the combination of spices. I went here to get the best, restaurant-grade treatment for this type of cuisine. I was wary of getting a poor impression from a more casual eatery. I am glad I did it this way. Now I know that I just may not like things from this particular type of ethnic food. It was so appetizing-looking, we'll probably go again and try some other things, just to make sure we didn't choose the wrong things off the menu. It wasn't that it was awful - and it was clear the chef took a lot of time and effort with the preparation and presentation. It just wasn't something I expected or was used to. It may be as simple as me not liking coconut milk in which case, what is one to do? The service was fine - neither too fast nor too slow. All things considered, this is an excellent place to try local cuisine
4
Really enjoyed everything about our evening at a The Blue Ginger. The food was lovely, served hot and quickly. We had 3 starters, 3 mains and a vegetable dish for 4 of us and had more than enough food. The prices are very good for the quality of the dishes offered. The service was also quite good. We will definitely return and bring new friends
3
In Singapore you need a very good excuse to go to a restaurant instead of one of the countless, fabulously delicious street food vendors, many of whom operate out of comfortable, sit-down "hawker centers" (essentially: food courts). For me, Blue Ginger does not meet the test. I didn't get the "Peranakan food" thing, either, though, so maybe it's me. To me, this was typical Chinese food, stewed or curried meat and seafood. The house specialty, the fish cake, came decoratively wrapped in a leaf but basically tasted and looked like sausage, and I personally deeply disliked its texture. If you are knowledgeable about this particular cuisine, Peranakan, you may disagree and be aware of nuances that I entirely missed. I did notice that our guest, extremely well-traveled in the region, commented that the food had been "good" - politely, with a noticeable absence of enthusiasm. That said, the place is clean, air conditioned, and quiet, so it might be well suited to a business lunch if you work in the neighborhood
4
This restaurant isn't massive or super famous but its reasonable prices and excellent service made my group very welcomed. 3 of us, 2 boys and a girl ordered 3 entries and 4 mains (eggplants, satay, fish and beef randang) and couldn't finish all. I believe portion of foods were generous
5
Visited the restaurant last Saturday for lunch. The food there was excellent, served hot. The service staff were attentive to my needs. This time, I brought my mother from taiwan and my colleague from Japan. The last time they tried the food at Blue ginger was about a year ago. Both of them were complementing that the food still tasted great. The restaurant is so popular that is why sometimes it is difficult to call them up for reservation. Best to get their business card to call to their office or managers directly for reservation. Great for people who wants to catch up with each other... or family dinner. My favourite dishes/Must try: Ngo Heong, Beef Rendang, Ayam Buah Keluak, Fish head curry, Ikan masak asam Gulai, Chap chye, Sambal Terong, Juhu Kangkong, Kangkong lemak, Otak otak, Durian Chendol, Gula Melaka Enjoy
4
Took two friends from overseas there. They enjoyed the food. It's South East Asian Chinese food. Straits Chinese food were started in Singapore, Penang and Malacca. It's called Peranakan. Good quality food with nice ambience. It's a good place to bring your guests from overseas if they didn't like to go to "too local" eateries. Old favourites are beef rendang, otar (grilled fish wrapped in banana leaf), ayam buah keluak (chicken in a type of sauce) and sambal kangkong (morning glory)
4
Dropped by early midweek and the restaurant was packed for lunar new year groups but did secure a lunch reservation for the next day. Food is prepared according to old family recipes but upscale in service and presentation. The nut chicken was delicious, unlike anything I had ever tried. The nuts are specially prepared over three days. The sauce is somewhere between a mole and the consistency of cocoa. Had a chile kind of shrimp which good but the chicken was the star. The tofu was somewhat what dissapointing even with the peanut sauce Price was reasonable. Th dining room is small, but attention is paid to the clients. Wish I had discovered this place earlier. Even my vegetarian daughter thought the food was special.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Blue Ginger. We ate in the attractive dining room upstairs and were pleased with the food and service.
1
Phone not answered to take a reservation, web-site does not respond. Have tried multiple times over a number of days. Have they closed?
5
We held our wedding banquet at Blue Ginger 2 years ago, and decided to revisit to celebrate our anniversary.
We still love their service and delicious food!
Remember to make reservations should you want to dine here.
2
Food was ok but nothing special, the staff was less than ok (but not unfriendly) and all in all not be recommended.
1
Once you sit, you feel you steped in the wrong place. Tables scratched, fabric bench look unclean, the menu is worn out, of course no table cloth (at least to hide the sticky-scratched plywood!). The content of the menu in an instant looks that everything is fake. All the dishes are really for one person maximum (size of war ration!). But prices are absolutely outrageous for the quantity, and for the quality of what is served. The food quality is off right BAD! Rendang has nothing to do with a real rendang here, one wonders who cooks, or if there is a cook at all! The Otak is awful, the so-called duck salad is awfull and of course a real rip-off, the Ayam Buah Keluak awful, so the Chap chye , Etc... A cup of simple Jasmine tea is charges at $ 4.50 ++ ... Why not !? why not do like Starbuck ! Not a dining experience, just a bad experience one does nt want to repeat. Oh ! and the price : a rip-off well over $$$ !
1
Very disappointing! They will chase guests away when there is another group of guests coming in! They don't want guests to occupy the table too long so that they could make more money.They allow the new batch of guests to surround the table while the current guests are still taking their drinks, then they will clear all the drinks from the table when the drinks are not finished.
5
Fantastic food every time we've dined here or have had home catering events by Blue Ginger. Last night, we were a party of 13, including out of town visitors. EVERY dish we ordered was delicious except for the chicken in the ayam bush keluak which was tough and tasteless. Last night was a lovely reminder that Blue Ginger does not use MSG in the food, as we were not thirsty after dining there. (I am extremely sensitive to MSG). The food was also very reasonable. All in all, it was another wonderful dining experience. Keep up the great food, Blue Ginger

Blue Ginger, near Chinatown ticks all the boxes for service, location, and design.The revelation for us was the Peranakan cuisine, a blend of Chinese and Malay styles. There's a style here, which although very much spice based, is more subtle than the "how hot do you want it" school. The Nonya Rolls are an excellent entree. For mains, the Udang Masak Assam Gulai is fresh tiger prawns simmered in spicy tamarind gravy flavoured with lemongrass. I had not had a tamarind dominant dish like this before, and ordered it both occasions.The Ayam Buah Keluak is braised chicken with turmeric, galangal and lemongrass cooked with Indonesian Buah Keluak black nuts. Extra nuts are $1.50 each. The wait staff told us this nut is poisonous unless properly prepared. (In it's natural form it contains hydrogen cyanide). We happily survived! Good selection of beer, although it is expensive. If I was going back to Singapore, I'd visit them again. It is a good reminder that food experience is one of the reasons we travel.The walk back through Chinatown is a bonus
4
We stopped here for lunch and managed to get the last free table. The restaurant was full of local people which I think is always a good sign. It is a nicely decorated restaurant with a cosy atmosphere.Our food was very tasty and well- presented, except we didn't like the fishcake very much. The beef rendang was delicious and we were offered more rice.It is worth trying if you want to experience Nonya food. I was hoping to have laksa but it was not on the menu (maybe that isn't nonya?). The prices seemed reasonable
4
My friends and I had a lovely Nyona dinner at The Blue Ginger. We were all not so big eaters so couldnt manage to try a lot of dishes. We ordered ayam buah keluak (my fav) and it turned out great!!! Kangkong lemak was specially cooked with some sweet potato topping! We originally wanted to order Nyona fish head curry but the restaurant ran out of ingredients for the dish so we ate steamed sea bass instead! It was soooo goooddd and probably the highlight of our dinner!!!!The ambience was great too! Love the christmas deco! I'm thinking of coming back on Sunday to try other dishes :))
4
We ate at this restaurant for lunch, and it was good. We had good food, and lots of it. Restroom was ok, service was very good. We'd go back. Make reservations.
4
not much people at lunch hours,
price is a little bit high, but still reasonable as their food is good & fresh
4
It was Monday night and our party of three had booked. Just as well as we might otherwise have missed out on this really excellent Peranakan treat.Amongst our starters were Otak Otak (fish cake) beautifully presented and prepared with an excellent balance of flavours. The Beef Rendang curry which followed was tender with a subtle use of spices. The other highlights were the wonderfully fresh steamed cod in ginger and the Ikan Masah Assam Gulai (mackerel in tamarind and lemongrass gravy). We ordered too much food but maybe that's not a problem when it was all so good.
4
We had a big group of 10 people, which gave us a good chance to taste a wide selection of the menu. I do not need to list everything because it was ALL good. We did have a second serving of the eggplant though. The different combinations of spices, herbs and sauces made for a distinctive, delicious and expertly prepared meal. Service was friendly and competent considering there were also other big groups. The wine list is not extensive and is on the expensive side

I ate at "Blue Ginger" after reading good reviews about it and I am glad I did as it was the best meal I had during my 3 days stay in Singapore. I was keen to try Peranakan cuisine, the food of descendants of early Chinese migrants who settled in Singapore inter-marrying with local Malays.Firstly Blue Ginger is a very intimate restaurant as it is not that big and it has great lighting, d√©cor and hence ambience. The welcome was warm and the service was perfect throughout my visit and meal.The menu was divine and I had a problem deciding what to have as there was so much I'd have loved to try. In the end I opted to Start with the 'Ngo Heong' (minced pork and prawns with five-spice powder wrapped and fired until golden)... It was delicious and I loved the texture as well. For my Main I had the 'Udang Kuah Pedas Nanas' (Tiger Prawns cooked in a tasty pineapple gravy) with a serving of rice and 'Seasonal Green Vegetables' (with oyster sauce, fried shallots and topped with black Chinese mushrooms). Again it was of a very high standard, fresh, flavoursome and delicious. With a beer my bill came to SG$79.00 (about GB¬£40) which I thought was excellent value for the quality and quantity of food I had.Highly Recommended - Note: "Blue Ginger" is also a restaurant listed in the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide "Top 10 Singapore" as one of the Top 10 Restaurants in the cities Chinatown district

We had two meals at this restaurant - one lunch and one dinner and both were superb. The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful in assisting us to order authentic Peranakan dishes.The manager Mr. Cheah Yen Hin was very concerned that we enjoyed our meal and assured us at lunch that he would be there when we returned for dinner and would help us decide on our meal then as well. The food in both meals was beautifully presented, the flavours were complex and delicious and the ambience in the restaurant was very pleasant.I can highly recommend the Blue Ginger to anyone looking for authentic Peranakan cuisine

The food is a mixture of local and Malaysian dishes. The service is friendly and attentaive. As the restaurant is quite small, they may not be able to fit you in. Have the Maxwell Hawker Centre as your Plan B. My favourite dish was the beef rendang. The meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a lovely flavour, and while spicy it is not just burn your mouth hot. The other dishes are very tasty, so they are not a one dish place. I may be a bit expensive but you will get value for money.

We have been to the Blue Ginger after reading about it on the LP. It is a nice small restaurant in the middle of Chinatown. We had some meat of two different kinds,it was really good but also spicy.. Nice place to go if you want a nicer and quiter place instead other places more confused.

Having spent literally days researching Singapore food options - food blogs, Timeout & Lonely Planet - I had high hopes for our meal here. I really wanted to love it. The menu looked good & we'd even decided what to have in advance.But it was all just very, very average. The signature chicken dish was blandly sauced, the chicken was nicely cooked (over charcoal I think) but not great quality chicken. For the same money, I'd rather have had the chicken satay from the no 7&8 satay stall outside Lau Pa Sat that I'd eaten the previous evening for 1/4 of the price. My husband's beef rendang was off-puttingly gristly but came with a tasty if not overwhelming fiery sauce. The cold duck salad to start was the best - perfect pink slices with a wonderful limey, sweet dressing but it failed to carry the rest of the meal.Atmosphere was pretty lacking - we had a late table admittedly at 9.15 but we were the 2nd last people in the place. I'm guessing the food-obsessed Singaporeans have long moved on and this place is trading on reputation..

Was not too keen going to this place based on the mixed reviews. But researched on the best dishes, to lessen any misses. Good to go here on an empty stomach as Iooking at the menu online, most ingredients consists of coconut milk, curry, tamarind etc. - heavy dinner fare.The restaurant is located right smack in the wedding shops/hip food joints at Tanjong Pagar. Place was small and seating can feel a little cramped. For starters, we got Sambal Terong Goreng (deep fried eggplant with chilli paste and soy sauce). Eggplant not too oily but just an ok dish. We got Kangkong Lemak, a veggie dish comprising of kangkong, sweet potato cooked in coconut milk with dried shrimp and chilli paste. This was quite tasty.We ordered the bestseller: Beef Rendang, tender beef cubes braised in coconut milk-rich curry with hints of ginger, lemongrass and lime. This was mouthwatering, loaded with smoky good flavors I have not tasted before. We ordered another batch, as my companions and I enjoyed it very much. We also like the endless supply of rice.Next is the Steamed Seabass/Cod flavored with garlic, chilli, spring onions or ginger and soy sauce. Eat this while hot for it loses its fresh appeal once cold. Over-all a good surprise in trying Peranakan food and kudos to Blue Ginger for keeping the tradition alive. If only for the rich Beef Rendang, will definitely recommend
5
The food was amazing! Very friendly staffs, great service and excellent food. Certainly Recommended!
4
Small and cosy, with small portions so that you can try more dishes. We try different dishes every time. Prices are OK, and the service efficient.
5
If you are passing by Singapore you have to come here!!! Each plate is an explosion of tastes and flavours of the total unknown.... A combination of sources never tried before. Furthermore is a very good value for money!!!
4
Blue Ginger is a lovely place with a great ambience and good food. For Pernakan food the spice and flavour seems very tailored to the audience and misses the authentic flavours. If you love a tuned down version of Pernakan food in a great ambience.
3
I had not been to Blue Ginger for some time and time has not been kind to it. The food was OK, if blander than I recall: the sotong was pretty good, but the mackerel disappointing. The sauce on the kangkong ruined it. Service was fine, but I don't think you could describe this as a genuine Peranakan restaurant any more, which is a shame. Try a hawker market just down the road
4
They have a tendency to loose reservations and to turn away customers who arrive late (9:15pm). Luckly it was not our case.The restaurant is small and the service is very attentive: rice and beverages are attended to with the right timing. Food is very well cooked and extremely tasty: we had Duck Salad among the starters and Beef Rendang and Ketak Lada (crayfish) as mains . A very good surprise
4
our first visit to Singapore. We mostly ate very well at hawker centres but we wanted one special meal on out last night and Blue Ginger was recommended. they were welcoming and dealt well with our different culinary preferences. The quality of the food was excellent
5
Really lovely food from a fab selection. My friend and I went for dinner mid week and were impressed by the choices and the flavours, in particular the beef rendang. Staff were friendly and helpful. We walked in but if you are a bigger party it might be worth reserving a table. Definitely recommend!
4
We enjoyed a tasty meal over leisurely conversation. Food was surprisingly quite good (I'm not a huge fan of Peranakan food) and well worth a return visit. Service was attentive and efficient and food came out quite quickly and was piping hot (good thing). I was impressed that the staff was not "in our face" and let us enjoy our conversation over dinner - Thank You! If you're unfamiliar with flavours of Peranakan food - ask your servers or the manager about it. It's NOT Chinese, NOT Malay, NOT Indonesian, NOT Indian food but often a combination thereof with a sprinkling of European touch to the food. It's worth trying. (NOTE - no parking but parking nearby)
2
I walked a good ways to get to this acclaimed restaurant. Ambiance is nice, and it's small and quaint. But the food was practically tasteless. I had the pork/crab meatball soup and the house special - "Blue Ginger" which is chicken in a tan colored sauce. The soup had been sweetened - yuck. And they served rice I didn't order with my dish and charged me for it. I didn't like any of it and I'm an ethnic food fanatic
4
The restaurant serves the local food which is sort of a cross between Chinese and Malay. The place is clean and the service is good.
4
A group of us visited recently, and we were fairly international mix of people. Food was good... The fish curry and the variety of dishes was nice. Good service for a big group.
4
Had lunch with friends the other day . Those sambal fish and I love the durian cendol the most . That restaurant also very near with mrt station .
4
Had dinner here with colleagues tonight- good service, great food and air conditioned relief from the steamy streets of Singapore. Our waitress chose some excellent entrees and main courses for us and we enjoyed the evening.
4
Truly delicious food with extraordinary flavours! big sized serves and I took my left overs home!
Will definitely be back.
Only thing that let the down was the uni-sex toilet. Only one for downstairs and it was pretty grubby with no hand towels.
Otherwise, lovely.
4
Went there without prior recommendation, service was really efficient, and the food was really good, we did stick to their recommended signature set, chicken, beef and eggplants. Good suggestions from waiter, efficient but unintrusive service, a very nice dinner in a relaxed environment (not crammed as too often in Singapore). A tad bit on the expensive side but still reasonable
4
Excellent peranakan cuisine; tasty local food, lots of spices, but not too hot. the beef rendang was tender and savoury, the sambal fish was excellent. Recommendations by staff was good, and we had nice entrees and local deserts such as the beautiful cendol;Nice atmosphere in a small and cosy place, perfect for a family diner and with friends
3
The restaurant is small and the decor is nice. I liked the ambiance and the location most of all, I think. The food was a little expensive, the portions were quite large. I got the beef rangoon, which is a predictable dish, and it was...predictable! Probably at a food court it would have tasted exactly the same and cost 20% of what it cost there. My husband got what I think was called the Blue Ginger chicken, and that was quite good, though it didn't seem as though the flavors were totally cohesive. Other people recommended it, though. So maybe this was just my experience.
4
My wife and I enjoyed a very good dinner at Blue Ginger, located in an older part of Singapore (gratefully unchanged) near Chinatown. Old-fashioned "nonya" cuisine; like eating at an aunt's house. Very tasty starters and main dishes; soups, crisp salads with duck. Very good seafood, duck, curries etc. Definitely try the vegetables. They have an iced coffee with a frozen ball of coconut floating on top for dessert that is life-changing. Accepts credit cards. Would happily return
4
Just returned from a conference in Singapore, where we asked our Singapore partner to recommend a good place for local (Perankan) cuisine. She recommended Blue Ginger, and we were not disappointed. Apparently it's very popular among visitors as well as locals, whose only "complaint" is that they're disappointed when the dishes don't taste exactly like they remember "grandma's cooking". Everything was very fresh and excellently prepared, sometimes tending toward (very) spicy, which I generally like. I tried the duck salad, vegetarian spring rolls, sambal terong goreng (deep fried eggplant - very spicy), sea bass -- all delicious. I really liked the Chendol dessert, but it's definitely an acquired taste -- there were differing opinions!This was my second trip to Singapore for business, and Blue GInger definitely tops the list of places where I've enjoyed the local cuisine
4
Service is fast! Four of us ordered 5 dishes, all served within 10 minutes.
Though all dishes are precook but they are warm and the taste is good.
Dessert Chendol was so so.
3
Decent venue and restaurant. Nice terrace on 1st floor. Service good. Food OK but really nothing special. Can get as good from the hawker stalls. Price reasonable.
4
What a wonderful way to explore another culture. It seemed like we were dining at someone's aunt's home, enjoying all of her favorite dishes. We were lucky to have a private dining room upstairs (can accommodate about 20 people). Shared plates seemed to work best. We also enjoyed the fact that there were so many vegetables. Keep in mind that this cooking is meant to be like eating in someone's home. It's not a Michelin dining experience. It's enjoying the local home recipes (Malay and Chinese combination). I highly recommend this for this reason..
4
Every dish we ordered was great. The staff was very attentive and her suggestion was really helpful. The beef randang is a must and I found the otah is only average. However, I would prefer to have this food once in a while because the taste is pretty heavy and spicy. Please make sure you make a reservation because they are mostly fully booked. I saw many parties were trying to get the tables (walk-in) and the staffs had to refuse all of them
3
Finally had a chance to dine at this place - didn't get why it was so promoted by lonely planet and so high rated in tripadvisor. We found the food just good, nothing extraordinary to write back home. The best thing at dinner were actually pickled veggies that come with rice as couvert. It is really not worth the effort of trying to book the table, because it was not easy for us - they were either closed for Chinese New Year or not answering the phone.
3
we've been there with a large group of 20+ guests and had chosen several different dishes (appetizer & main dishes) to share amongst us. the food was ok, but nothing really special. some dishes, like the mackarel, were nobody's flavor, maybe simply because not really differentiating to a normal fast food Chinese restaurant.conclusion of the group, some liked it (4*), some meant it was normal (3*) and some were disappointed (2*)PS: only some of the servant were able to speak English, but at least the others understood the words Beer and Rice... ;-
4
We had read quite a bit about this restaurant. Unfortunately Singapore does not have many Nonya type restaurants. We had a lunch here and it was very tasty. The vegetable and seafood offerings were delicious. The restaurant was quite crowded but we still found the service to be very good. Our waiter knew a lot about the dishes and was only too happy to help with recommendations. It was very good food
5
I think people are penalizing this because of the high expectations they have. Singapore has dozens of great inexpensive peranakan (Chinese/Malay) places, and most are in hawker stalls.You pay a bit more here, but get nice ambience, and very good food. If you don't want the very best in a hawker stall, and want good ambiance/location, this is a great choice. Make sure you try the dessert, chendol. Most westerners don't think of dessert when eating chinese, but this is different. Kind of a coconut milk slurpee, but fresher, with a flavoured jelly of some sort. Fantastic. If you are adventurous, you can have it with durian paste (not a bad way to try durian, if you have never had it)Also this is a great choice for an inexpensive business dinner. Not too quiet, not too loud
3
It used to be an authentic, fresh cooked restaurant.My third visit to Blue Ginger was a bit of let down though.1. Food was served in a minute we finished ordering, not to mention they served mains first instead of starters.2. Dishes were lukewarm.3. If I were to eat some precooked meals, I'd have chosen to go to Maxwell food court. Why would I pay this price for such food?4. Only 1 person (probably the manager) spoke English that I could understand unfortunately
3
We ate at Blue Ginger a couple of weeks ago. The food is very average as are the restaurant surroundings. A fairly non descript meal and not somewhere that I would head back to. A short but sweet review as it was so unmemorable there is really nothing more to say
5
I was with a large group of people and samples about a dozen dishes. I thought the food was outstanding and the service was very attentive!
I look forward to going back on my next trip to Singapore.
4
Went with 3 others, booked in advance, which is a must, even on a weekday night. Great service, pleasant but simple surroundings. Food arrived quickly and was absolutely delicious. Wine excellent value. For Singapore the value is exceptional.
4
It's difficult to find a good value restaurants in his city. Plenty of great street food at hawkers centers, but restaurants tend to be pricey. We went as a group of six and decided to leave the choice of dishes to the waiter. I can't remember exactly what we had but the highlights were the crispy skin cod and the chicken with the black nut (speciality); the spicy prawns were also good and the aubergine tasty, but my rendang is better! My guess is whatever you order will be lovingly prepared and plated in this family restaurant where the pride in the food is obvious. As residents, we shall be back
4
In a very expensive city this is a true find. The food is excellent, very fresh ingredients, smartly put together with thoughtful consideration of tradition. We were a group of 20 and had arranged a set menu beforehand. Every dish was delicious and there were only empty plates and no complaints at the end of our meal!We were lucky enough to be accommodated "upstairs" in the old Peranakan shop house which is decorated in the old style with modern touches of colourful paintings. We will certainly be back on our next visit to Singapore
4
We found this restaurant by chance, it was full when we enquired after a table. The pleasant staff asked us to come back in 15 minutes & a table was made ready. The aromas as you walk into the restaurant are over powering. A small restaurant catering in Chinese & Malaysian cuisine with great ambiance. The food was excellent & the staff are happy to advise to make the gastronomic experience better I.e., my partner ordered a soup & it was suggested to add a dash of chilli & lime juice, which she enjoyed. Try this little gem, you won't be disappointed
5
This Nonya or Peranakan restaurant turns out fabulous, exotic ishes steeped in the Malay-Chinese tradition. The restaurant is an old house. It is small, colorful and snug. If you llike interesting flavors and nuanced flavors, Nonya/Peranakan cooking is that by nature. The Otak Otak starter is amazing, made of fish cakes with turmeric,chili paste, lime leaves, galangal, shrimp paste and candle nuts. What a start. Makerel with tamarind and lemongrass, vegatables in spicy shrimp paste and sweet soy sauce, chicken cooked in cocunut milk and exotic spices are a few of the dishes we had. Everything on the menu tempts you. We can't wait to return
5
We booked a table here for our first night in Singapore so we didn't have to worry about finding somewhere and were not disappointed.The food was delicious, particularly some of the more "different" options like the stingray - highly recommended! This was one of those places where I could have easily ordered the entire menu.The service was great, as was the decor of the restaurant, and the whole meal was great value.I'd advise booking a table as it does get busy (I asked our hotel to book for us)
4
Went here as part of a big group and a 'function' dinner. Everything was fresh and flavoursome with a bit of a kick - Singapore fare as I remembered it. The beef rending was a particular favourite with every spice discernible. Similarly meltingly soft eggplant was a standout dish. Would love to return and choose from the menu. Lime juice a cooling option- alcohol a bit pricy
5
I gotta tell you, i love Peranakan food. And Blue Ginger is the place to go!I've tried other places in Singapore like the other "Blue" restaurant and Ivan's, but they don't stack up to Blue Ginger.1) I love to Ayam Buakalat (spelling not perfect).. cooked so well and i love taste of the big black nutshell that comes with it2) Ngo Hiang was really cooked well3) Beef Rendang, went really well on its own but even better over some white rice.. 4) Sambal Prawns.. cooked just right and not too spicy! 5) Chendol - fantastic dessert. Overall, was really enjoyable. Cozy atmosphere too :
4
It was our first time to try Peranakan food and we loved everything we ate. The acar was so good that we asked for refill :)Plenty of choice if you want vegtarian but the meats are wonderful too. Ordered sate babi and it looked different than expected but that taste...oh, I can almost taste it again it was so good. It was rather busy so if you plan to go on a friday/saturday you might need to make a reservation first
5
As a vegetarian I was a little apprehensive about trying this restaurant but am glad I did. The atmosphere was cozy and bright, the food delicious, and the staff were very friendly. A great option if you wish to try peranakan cuisine.
4
I was here with friends and the service was fairly good but the food was amazing with a great range of vegetarian options
5
Good peranakan food and amazing atmosphere in a old shophouse.
I recommend to book a table upstairs, close to the windows.
4
Good peranakan food and ambience within an old conserved shophouse at 97 Tanjong Pagar Road! There is Ayam Boah Keluak, Beef Rendang, Chap Chye, Kueh Pie Tie, Otak Otak, Bakwan Kepiting, etc. Service is good! It gets better if you sit upstairs!
5
This is a small restaurant in a two-level building from the early 20th C. The cuisine is Peranakan which means based on the original Malay inhabitants. The food is exquisitely prepared and gently presented. Try anything or everything.
4
This was a lovely restaurant, the food was served warm, was tasty. The desserts were a little too authentic. I will return!
4
The Blue Ginger is a small Peranakan restaurant on two floors in a small building on Tanjong Pagar Road. Booking is essential as it is seemingly very popular and with good reason. The food is excellent and presented well. Prices were reasonable but wine was a little pricy. Service was good. The fish cakes are worth a try and are certainly different. The prawn dishes are also excellent. With desserts avoid the Durian which is truly disgusting although our Singaporean friend enjoyed it greatly it is definitely an acquired taste
4
I enjoyed this - for someone who doesn't eat meat, I had a lot of choice which is quite rare. Many prawn dishes. Spicy and tasty food. Sensible portion sizes. Attentive staff and fast service. Only quibbles: my friends beef was disappointing and the wine is quite pricey. I will go again on future trips. Yummy sago dessert! I also liked the simple cafe style - casual and friendly
3
My Singaporean colleague took us to this restaurant on our first night in the city. She wanted to introduce us to the food from the culture she was raised in...Chinese-Malay. The meal was pretty good, but I can't remember any of the dishes specifically...they were all very new to me! I wasn't "blown away" by this restaurant, but there was nothing remarkable either. Might not be my first choice should I return to Singapore
4
My local colleagues in Singapore have told me over the years that there are only a handful of restaurants in town where you can experience what was the original cuisine of Singapore ‚Äì and that perhaps the best was The Blue Ginger restaurant.The food is from a culture that was/is called the Peranakan ‚Äì a blend of Chinese and Malay. So, you get some dishes that can be spicy and loaded with many flavors. I began with the duck salad. The dish had four slices of smoked duck that was very flavorful and tender, rested on a bed of greens that included bean sprouts. The other greens I couldn‚Äôt identify but they had a slightly tart taste. Al topped with a tangy sauce. I asked my waiter what was a classic dish ‚Äì he said the Ayam Panggand ‚Äúblue ginger.‚Äù This was chicken from the thigh and drumstick that was deboned and smothered in a thick sauce of coconut milk with a variety of spices, including a little pepper. Incredible. The waiter was extremely helpful. There is a very limited wine list by the glass. But you get over that when the first dish arrives and you are thinking about the flavors on the plate, not the winde in the glass.I haven‚Äôt tried the other Peranakan restaurants but not sure I need to try them. This one is a keeper
3
The food was tasty but the service was terribly slow and therecwas no wine selection. Overall less than average. If ihad to choose I would not go to this restaurant to experience Singapore
4
Cozy ambience. Great, friendly service. And best of all, excellent food at very reasonable prices. Definitely one of my top recommendations in Singapore.
4
My first visit to Blue Ginger, although have been to True Blue several times. I think this place is better. Really interesting menu and everything we tasted was good. The dining room has plenty of natural light, and has a traditional feel about it.
3
We went here in a lunch time. Not many guest at around 12pm. The service is very good.. very helpful and responsive.The food is good but the price is high.. It is in fact quite expensive... After bringing the food, they served the rice for us. When I checked the bill, i found that each cost S$2.2
4
My mother and I are allergic to crustaceans, which means we can't really risk many of the street foods that often incorporate prawns or shrimp paste without being labelled as such. In the Blue Ginger the helpful waiter and chef checked our orders and let us know options we could have safely. The duck salad was quite sweet - interesting almost like bacon, vegetarian spring rolls not too greasy, fish head soup delicious. Other reviewers have said to try their durian dessert. Its not the first time I've had durian, but it helped me reach the conclusion I'm not about to acquire the the taste any time soon. And it keeps repeating on you (maybe because of the red bean mixed with it), I was trying for hours to get rid of the taste. Anyway eat at your own risk. Otherwise a good experience and fun to wander through the neighbourhood nearby afterwards. Found the oldest teahouse in Singapore nearby on Neil St with tea museum etc, and a great modern coffeeshop with excellent flat white too
4
Reading the other reviews I am a little bit confused.Some say the food is not real, some say it's the best... I liked it, real or not.The ambiance is nice but informal, the staff is friendly and helpful.Obviously if there is something more genuine or authentic is very difficult for a first time visitor like me, but my overall experience was very positive.I also dared to try the famous Durian... It's a fruit that Singaporeans happen to love so much that you can find it in every market and they also made a building with the shape of the fruit: well, be warned... If you are not from singapore you cat't eat it. It's too strong and smelly! At the restaurant they were so nice to take my order of durian back when they saw that I could not eat it and substitute it with vanilla ice cream!
5
Fantastic experience of Peranakan cuisine, a blend of Chinese and Malay flavours and cooking spices. Great attentive service and help choosing the right dishes. I ate the most succulent Otak Otak followed by amazing Halibut marinated in a spicy sambal paste. The atmosphere is down to earth in a colonial building close to china-town. Would go back anytime
5
We've tried a few Peranakan restaurants in Singapore and this is the best one yet. Nice and cozy inside with some Peranakan touches but not over the top. We had lunch and the staff were helpful at suggesting which food to order to get a nice variety between the two of us. The prices were reasonable, we felt and the food we ordered was all very good:- 5 spice rolls were nice and light, not too fatty - a bit big for a starter- Otah (fish paste in banana leaves) was tasty and not too spicy- Chicken in coconut curry was very good - boned and rolled so very tasty mix of breast and leg- Prawns penang style had 5 big prawns but not for everybody as quite sour (tamarind flavour).All in all, very pleased
5
After arriving at the airport we had our lunch at the Blue Ginger in Singapore. We were treated to different types of Singaporean Food. The place was simple, you have to go one level up from the street to reach their dining area. The place was cozy and the food was great. I specially loved their Kueh Pie Tee a mixture of Shrimp, bamboo and turnip placed in an individual pie cups matched with their thick soy sauce i was able to eat lots of it. Their other delectable dishes which i coupled with a refreshing lime juice was really a lunch fit for a king.
1
The restaurant is located on the lively Tanjong Pagar restaurant strip, and the staff are friendly and helpful. But this is where the positive ends. We started with the Crispy Chicken Bites with sweet chilli dipping sauce. These were unremarkable. We then went on to Beef Rendang and the Ayam Buah Keluak. The beef chunks in the Rendang had not been cooked long enough to be tender. Both dishes were submerged under a thick layer of oil, and both sauces were one-dimensional - lacking the layers of spices and flavour that are the hallmark of Nonya cuisine. My partner refused to finish his food, which is saying something. We did not stay for dessert. You would do better at the buffet of any good hotel in Singapore. For those truly interested in tNonya cuisine, a little Internet research will bring the names of some good places to light. This isn't one of them
4
The food here is excellent though pricey. The service is good. I love the decor which is distinctively Peranakan. The location is central and hence I often bring visiting foreign friends here for a meal and introduce them to the unique Peranakan culture and cuisine.
4
Busy nice little restaurant - suggest you book, lots of people turned away on the night.
4
This restaurant is located on Tanjong Pagar Road in central Singapore. The food was served quickly by the friendly staff. We return to this restaurant every time we are in Singapore because we enjoy the ambiance and delicious food. Highly recommended.
5
great service, amazing food, eat the Beef Rendang.
5
Unless you have a Grandma who can make this cuisine, your best bet is to go here. Located in a quaint shophouse, charmingly decorated. We had no reservation when we showed up on a Saturday evening, and the place is packed. Yes, there are some tourists and some locals, but aren't we are tourists in some way? The attendant asked us to come back in half hour so there will be some table cleared. So we went around the block to one of the many bars and grabbed a drink. When we came back, we shown to the table right immediately. I live the warm decor and the colorful artwork displayed. We live in Singapore, we know what the pricing is like for restaurants. This place is by no mean overpriced! Of course it's not food court stall price either. We ordered: Kuey Pie Tee-- just ok; Otak Otak- steamy hot and not over spiced; Ayam Buaj Keluak (an unusal spice and our favorite-- best way to describe it is- mole sauce like; Sambal Bendy (okras with perfectly spiced shrimpy paste), Stamed Seabass (meaty whole fish with tomato and soft tofu dressed with preserved bean paste that was not overpowering the sweet tender fish). The dishes were served in family style to us in which the waiter came around to ask us to ladle rice onto our plates. I like the fact that the waitresses are in basic shirts and pants with no make-up or dangling jewelry and hair perfectly/neatly put together. Certainly an appreciated detail. The service was excellent and our bill for what we ordered along with beer and tea and desserts was less than S$150. Definitely will take clients and friends AND ourselves when we want Peranakan food
2
Most disappointing. I went there by the recommendation of Jacky Yu in a Hong Kong guidebook, and found it most disappointing and overpriced. Serivce is not attentive but decor is nice for tourists (and the customers seem mostly tourists from HK and probably USA by their accent). We could hear one another's conversations as the tables were so packed
4
Located along the Tanjong Pagar road sits a charming little Peranakan restaurant that is run by a group of enthusiastic restaurateurs, who are passionate to serve up refined and dainty nyonya dishes with flavors that are packed with a punch. Carefully curated ingredients, fresh spices and passion create the palate for Blue Ginger's thoughtful menu that aims to satisfy the most discerning taste buds. Always a joy to dine in places where its people are enthusiastic about its service as with its food.If you enjoy coconut and spices, Blue ginger should make it to your must-try list!Try their Kuey Pie Tee, Sambal Chilli, Achar, Kang Kong, Beef Rendang and Ngoi Hiang. It's really good! Make reservation before you head down, it gets packed in the evenings
5
This is true authentic local cuisine that showcases the best produce and finest service. The pork is incredibly delicious as is the crab ball soup. Highly recommend for an authentic taste of cultural Singapore. A great location and soft ambience. Make it a must do stop on your next visit
4
We dined as a party of 5 colleagues from an office. The setting is a two story 'house' converted into a restaurant. When we arrived on a Wednesday night, both stories were full. We were greeted by name before we even introduced our party, something which has never happened to me before! Most of the other diners were in large groups, some with 10+ people, and service seemed comfortable to manage that. We had one person with an allergy, and the waiter was patient in advising us which dishes would be ok to eat, and reviewed the list with the chef. We ordered a selection of dishes to share, and the quality was excellent. As 'foreigners' the spiciness was just right -- a good bite without forcing tears. We tried spring rolls, beef Rendang, prawns, a chicken dish (the least exciting of the selection), fish curry, and a wonderful pork dish. Definitely worth a visit, and the price is a good value for the quantity and quality. Enjoy

I have been here several times with friends and always had a great experience. I found it difficult to find Peranakan cuisine outside the hawker stalls. Each meal I had was fresh and tasted home-made. I am not familiar with Pernakan cuisine so others may disagree, but the dishes were well-balanced and nicely presented

Two story shophouse serving Peranakan food. Good service and a good range of delicious food with a different set of flavours to other Asian cuisine. We'll be back next visit to Singapore. Recommend booking.

Loved our meal here in this small restaurant. Was nice to get off of the main tourist track for a minute and enjoy some beautifully prepared peranakan food. Nice service, nice decor. Wish we could have tried every dish!

Peranakan Speciality... will be liked by Indians due to various spices and aroma. They have been awarded also. Its walkable from Chinatown. Or from Amara hotel, take the right and walk for five minutes.

This restaurant seems to be frequented by lots of locals including ex-pats. The food was very good and the service was excellent. It's relatively inexpensive. There's not much ambiance but the food makes up for that.

Reservations are a necessity at Blue Ginger; it gets full very quickly so if you arrive without a table booked you could easily be disappointed. The restaurant is over both the ground and first floor of a shophouse, and it's not particularly spacious - if claustrophobic, you won't enjoy being crammed in.The food is pretty good: beef rendang, some tofu, and other peranakan dishes, but the menu isn't that extensive and there's little choice in drinks. Service is not brilliant; I suppose this is Singapore so it might never be anything wonderful, but when the waiter managed to be vague and bash one of us in the jaw as he delivers the dishes, you think they could do better on the training front

Situated in a row of shops, it would be easy to miss Blue Ginger. The restaurant is fairly small but has another room upstairs which is good for larger groups.The Perankan/Nonya food was delicious with plenty of choice. - fish, meat and vegetable options. Service was very good and the staff were happy to help

It has been a while since I ate here and I was pleasantly surprised.Peranakan/ Nonya food is a very unusual taste and Blue Ginger do it well.The food was tasty and well cooked. Service was prompt and the staff polite and attentive. I note the reviewer who says the place looks tired and need a paint job, I didnt feel that, I felt it was a dining room in a old style setting and it appeared clean enough to me.The Beef rendang was spicy and very tasty and the meat was nicely cut and not fatty or gristly. The Pie Tee were tasty and a lovely appetiser. The Stingray in peper sauce was OK but wasn't my favourite. All in all a pretty good place

Avoid. I chose this place based on the Lonely Planet 2012 recommendation as one of the best options for Peranakan cuisine. But the dining rooms are tired and desperately need a paint job; the service was completely indifferent; and our two main courses (which the waiter suggested) were practically inedible -- a whole panfried fish and tiger prawns ruined by overcooking. The waiter never asked how our food was and we practically had to tackle him to get our bill -- which wasn't exactly cheap. Sadly, this was the worst meal we had in Singapore

We ended up at blue ginger after we turned up at the famous newton hawker centre and found it was closed for spring cleaning and did not regret it. The menu is peranaken nonya cuisine - we had NGO hiang pork to start which was delicious, then a prawn and tamarind curry, grilled pork and seasonal greens. All the dishes were delicious, service was friendly and efficient as well. Male for 2 with a few beers was $120 - not bad at all and I really enjoyed our dishes. I would definitely go bac

Blue Ginger is an informal nonya style restaurant which is good to visit with a group of friends so that it is possible to order a variety of items. The food is not tip-top - there are better places for nonya cooking - but it is reliable and generally pretty good. The fish head curry is a personal favorite. Otah-otah is not bad. The beef rendang can be a little dry. Most of the dishes with lady fingers (okra) are good, and the chef is not afraid to season properly. the location in an old China Town shophouse is attractive and a good place to take out of towners

We have been to Blue Ginger a number of times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. The menu offers plenty of choice, without being a 'Jack of all trades'. The wine list is concise but fairly well thought out and you can bring your own bottle for a small corkage fee. Service is prompt and friendly.Each time that we go there, I keep promising myself that we will try something new, but keep going back to our old favourites simply because they do them so well. I love their duck salad, satay and spiced aubergine, but the very thought of their Beef Rendang gets my mouth watering the moment that we make reservation.We are usually seated upstairs which can get a bit noisy, but that only adds to the atmosphere. Sure, you can get cheaper food at the nearby hawker centre, but Blue Ginger is very reasonably priced if you want to sit in a nicely restored shophouse with AC and pleasant service

Looking for the best of Malay, Chinese, Indian and some European thrown in, then head to The Blue Ginger, Tanjong Pagar Road, Singapore. It is the best Peranakan food around and the ambiance is beautiful with soft jazz playing in the background. Be sure to check it out and enjoy...

Decided to take a chance ona Friday evening with no booking. We were fairly early and got a table but chancers after us were turned away as fully booked. We were given a good explanation of the fairly small menu and each dish was clearly identified for us on arrival byh the courteous server. I am sure dishes were individually prepared and the presentation was excellent as was the food. Certainly worth a visi

Cosy, family owned and ran restaurant near the China town. The menu has large selection of variety of peranakan dishes. Service was outstanding, very caring and almost custom made food preparation. The server was very knowledgable and helpful with best selection. They also had great dishes from special but in deed all of them were mouth watering dishes

I took my boss there for lunch after having had a business meeting on Tanjong Pagar Road - the restaurant was selected purely based on the venue. It was conveniently located right next to our client's office and the place was air-conditioned (absolutely vital in Singapore during lunchtime when it gets crazy hot). The kueh pie tie was good, but my fish curry main course was very disappointing. The cendol desert was very average - one could probably get a similar one at a third of the price at the Maxwell Road hawker centre around the corner (but of course, have to sweat it out there). The ambience was lovely but the food was very average at the end of the day. You're paying to dine in a lovely, cool atmosphere on Tanjong Pagar Road rather than for any kind of special food. The service was good - but would I return? I probably would, simply because I have an important client in that area and I cannot stand the thought of having lunch in a non air-con place in Singapore (it's just too crazy hot and humid) - but avoid the fish curry

I just moved into the area and had passed by this place several times and it was always busy so I thought to myself it had to be good. One night with friends we were looking for a place and it was around 8:30 and I thought it would be a good chance to go without having to bother with the crowd or reservation. We got our seats on the ground floor pretty quickly. The food is very very average and I have definitively had better peranakan and nonya fair in Singapore. The portions were small for the price. The food was very normal. The interior was normal. The service was very average. I wouldn't go back again. And if you are from out of down, search a little harder if you really want something special

The food at Blue Ginger is a good introduction to Peranakan for guests and its a good restaurant to take people as the atmosphere and local are wonderful. It's located on Tanjong Pagar Road not far away from Chinatown and some of the CBD hotels. It wasn't my favorite spot and is a little pricey but recommended if you want "safer" and "easier" food with out of town guests

I call to make a reservation for 3 for 6:30 PM on a Wednesday. The person who answered the call quickly forwarded it to another person who took my reservation. It was efficient. In the evening I arrived at the restaurant at about 6:10 PM but the closed sign is still up and the waitress told us they are not opened yet. So we had to wait outside. In future I will make reservations for a later time.At precisely 6:30 PM, they opened the door. When I mentioned that I had a reservation for 3, the captain immediately called me by my name. That felt good. He showed us to our table. My wife and I seat facing the entrance so that we can see our friend when he showed up. That is not a good seat as the restaurant had glass doors and it faced a junction. The light from cars stopping there before making a turn will shine directly on your face. I told the captain and he said that the owner has been informed but has yet to take action.We ordered our drinks - ice lemon tea. If you can't take very sweet drink do not order this. They do not make their own ice lemon tea but pour it from a can. It is very very sweet. I had to order a glass of water to dilute the drink.My friend arrived and wanted to order the same drink. I discouraged him unless he loved very sweet drinks. He had water instead. We ordered the 2 starters (Kueh Pie Tee and Otak Otak) as these were uniquely Peranakan dishes, two main dishes (Ayam Panggang ‚ÄúBlue Ginger‚Äù and Seafood Campur Nanas) and a mixed vegetable (Chap Chye Masak Titek). The food, I must say, is delicious. The portioning was just good for the 3 of us. My friend had read about Nonya food but has yet to taste them. He is from the Middle East. This was his first experience and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Our final order was dessert (Chendol). We ordered only two as I knew it will be too sweet for me. Throughout the dinner, I noticed that there were only two servers. All tables were filled with diners. There are about 21 diners. They were really trying very hard to be responsive to our needs and it was not easy. So the service was a bit slower.Overall the experience was pleasant and the food is good

We found this restaurant on our first night in Singapore while getting a bit lost. It looks very nice and welcoming hence we walked in. Service was very friendly and fast. The cuisine is peranakan/malaysian as per the menu. We ordered fish cakes to start with and they were excellent! I had Kangkong Lemak (vegetable dish) with rice and my husband had Beef Rendang. My dish was a mixture of different flavors and was quite exciting, my husband's rendgang was a very good standard too. All in all thoroughly enjoyable dinner. The bill came up to about $80 but we had about 3 beers which was probably the most expensive thing on the bill.Strongly recommend

Atmosphere is nice and service ok,the food is typically local, i would say a little better than food court but the price is 5 times more.I went with a friend there, we had starter (rather small) and a main (not big at all) with water for a total bill of 83 sgd !!!!! Next time i'll go for western food for the same price

My favourite peranakan resturant!! Fresh food perfected by the sincerity of tradition.

very good perakanese restaurant
3
A not bad peranakan food
5
Very suprising cooking quite exquisite. A bit over normal price but worth to try once for dishes never tasted before in peranakan culture
2
Nice artwork. The food is pricey and just okay. We probably won't return.

We truly enjoyed the food ... well cooked, distinct flavors..and different to the average fare you get at other places. A good expierence.Decor is simple...location is great...row of 2-floor-colonial style houses..so a nice area to have dinner and to see some "old style" Singapore (after being in modern buildings all day).Service was friendly, attentive and good

I was so excited about going back to Blue Ginger. I first went to the restaurant 3 years ago having read good things - and every word was true. I went a second time 2 years ago on the way back from Europe and my taste buds were woken from their European-food inspired catatonic state by fiery flavours and textures. Third time even luckier? No, sadly. I was very disappointed. We couldn't get in earlier than 9pm and by the time we arrived there were only a few tables of expats still dining. The waitress handed over menus and having chosen our favourites, she proceeded to strongly urge/push the more expensive seafood items at us (it was late, the seafood probably didn't have much shelf time left I assumed). I was firm though and stuck to my guns. We ordered a bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc. It hadn't been refrigerated and was as hot as the Singapore evening. She placed it in ice but it took a good 20 mins before it was cold enough to drink. The food was OK - not as good as in the past. The service was not good. Have they changed hands? Have the previous owners and chef opened somewhere else? All I have now are memories

The "Straits Chinese" have their own cuisine, it's similar to what we'd generally refer to as Malay but with a twist. The Blue Ginger is a great place to go check it out. The downstairs setting is cosy and romantic, while upstairs they cater for larger groups. Service is very friendly, waiters will explain the dishes and be happy to make recommendations. We found their wine list to be quite good, including their selection of house red and house white. The fish cake is an absolute must

The Blue Ginger has 3 levels, the top one only beeing opened for private functions. When booking, make sure you ask for the ground level as it's the most intimate. Service is swift and very friendly and keen to answer any and all questions about the various dishes. We love their fishcake, the various curries and if the pickles would be available for take away, we'd take a big glass home every time. Decent wine list with both the house white and house red good value and pleasant

Let's face it! Peranakan cuisine requires painstaking effort and plenty of time to be authentic. Therefore, in truth, it can only be accomplished in one's home. So, it is rather impossible to push out "authentic" level dishes in any restaurant. That being stated, I will proclaim that Blue Ginger offers high quality Peranakan cuisine that is served in a warm and nicely decorated, if not rather authentic, setting. Is Blue GInger my favorite place for authentic Peranakan cuisine? NO... my Mother-In-Law's kitchen is
