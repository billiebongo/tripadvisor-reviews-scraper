Had the prawn noodle soup last week with an additional bowl of pork rib soup. All are so good. I would prefer the soup to be more "dense" rather than the clear broth version. Hence the 4 stars. Overall, it is still very good, tasty bowls of food. The prawns are firm and you can even request the cook to remove the shell for you. The pork ribs are tender and easily off the bone. And the nice touch is that they provide packet of wet tissue to the diner. Smart!

I learned about Mings Prawn Noodles (or MPN, for the regulars) through a colleague of mine. The prawn noodles is the most authentic and flavorful version in Singapore. I have tried in other old haunts around Kallang also, but this tastes more power packed. Owner will ask if you want your prawns "with shell or de-shelled". I used to take with shell for even more flavor, but now i'm lazy. Wet tissue provided free of charge too. Pork ribs are moist and tender. Learned that the owner wakes up 2am daily to get the prawns fresh from the port. A little out of the way, but worth every slurp

Finally found a stall selling decent prawn noodles with a pork base soup!! And I had this a few weeks after a trip to KL where I had delicious prawn mee.I ordered a soup version of the pork rib noodles with a mix of yellow noodles and beehoon. Really love this a lot and I can't wait to return and try the dry prawn mee itself! My mother had that and she found it decent as well, for one who knows what is good and bad! :DI hope they will continue to prosper since the food is prepared by a young man
