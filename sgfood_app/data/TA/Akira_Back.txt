Located under the jw Marriott this restaurant is excellent if you want something a little different than your usual Japanese. Every course we had was sensational. The service was very attentive and very professional. Nice atmosphere, nice seating and good drinks. Highly recommended. Thanks to them for our anniversary dessert.
5
The food quality is as high as it’s always been - expect nothing less than from Akira Back!Also, just want to highlight great service from one of the staff, Nick. Thanks very much for always taking initiatives to make our dinner experience top notch
5
Quality of the food and service definitely justified the price paid. Not one to take photos of food, but I think this would definitely be insta-worthy
5
The stylishly understated decor and quiet atmosphere were my best first impressions. The tuna pizza was the biggest surprise after my first bite. Don’t let its simple face fool you, it’s packed with flavors, you won’t be able to sto
5
Situated at the JW Marriott (one floor down) this restaurant is a gem. It has a nice ambience, is quiet enough for pleasant business dinners with a very interesting menu. The wine is also excellent. The service is impeccable and all dishes are served with an exquisite twist
3
The location, ambience and service was very good but the food portion was too little. After we had lunch here, we move off to another restaurant for food
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday at Akira Back and I really appreciate the staff for preparing a dessert for the occasion. Attentive services, relaxing ambiance and awesome food. AB Pizza Tuna is a definite must-try! It is so tasty that we even thought of ordering a second plate! Perfect storm rolls are filling and tasty. Atlantic Black Cod and desserts are also all nicely presented and taste really good.No doubt that I will come back to dine in Akira Back again
5
was served by lady staff Adleyn and we are impressed by her positive attitude to make us feel comfortable through the busy night. we were first seated at the tall table and mentioned to her about getting a sofa seat once the other guests have left. she was zooming around running her errands and we feared we may be forgotten. but Adleyn surprised us with a good sofa seat less than half an hour later! she went on to serve us well and we are very very happy and satisfied that such a staff exist! Keep it up!
4
Good ambience but average food. Can talk to chef directly to share specifics of my feedback on food. Service was good and menu with variety of option
5
Back again for the delicious food with another birthday girl. New dish tried this time is the gyudon - never knew it goes so well with foie gras and onsen egg! Highly recommended!
5
Had a awesome dinner at Akira back.The staff are forever polite and professional and was allocated a nice table as per my request.The food never failed to meet my expectation.Ordered mostly the Chef recommendation and the food was served fast.Awesome ambience and service.Would like to thank Johan (if I got his name correctly) for the great service and recommendation!Dr E Cho

Cosy, elegant with nice contemporary pieces of art ( the largest one apparently painted by the chef’s mother ) on its walls. Service was very attentive and good. Food was mostly well presented and appreciated. The “Brother from another mother” sushi roll though, was disappointing - flat in taste and uninteresting in texture, character and bite. The Eggplant with miso was topped with cheese, their shrimp tempura was made from large prawn cubes, sashimi was in thick slices n fresh. The seared yellowtail with brussel sprout leaves n wasabi was creative yet subtle, The fried rice with Alaskan crab was very flavourful, with good wok hei, plus lots of ingredients that enhanced the aldente rice with a good bite. A rather pleasant place to spend an evening
5
Trendy contemporary and elegant Japanese restaurant, started by a Korean American, first in Las Vegas and now with branches in many countries. This is the only one in Singapore started about a year ago in the hip new South Beach area opposite the Suntec Convention Centre and in the JW Marriott.The signature must try dishes are tuna pizza (not at all what I expected - It’s tuna sashimi carefully laid on a crispy thin crust!), wagyu tacos, wagyu fried rice and the rolls - Brother FA Mother was my fav!! The hand rolls are very unusual and are not wrapped in seaweed but some rice flour skin - each one is fairly sizable with perfect combination of flavours in each bite. I loved the baked crab roll.Service was excellent
4
Great atmosphere and value! Further, this is one of the rare restaurants that offer Gluten Free version of their dishes. Fantastic service too. Will certainly bring my family back
5
The food was excellent. I went with 2 friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish. The service was also good and the decor in the restaurant was lovely.
4
Service was excellent. The hot and cold plates were unique and tasty. Sushi rolls could be improved in terms of both presentation and taste
4
Interesting presentation of food. Many for sharing like tapas style. Provided us with a baby chair and quiet corner as we brought our one year old grand child along
5
Another great Japanese food in Singapore. The AB (Akira Back) Pizza was really awesome, thin + crispy = yummilicious The name of the sushi rolls was sooooooo unique, "Brothers From Different Mother"! And the "Crispy Pork Belly Rolls" was yummy too.. start off with a "Spicy Crab Miso Soup" was a great choice!I love the environment and ambient too. Very classy and cosy with nice music. The servers were very friendly and attentive too.Will bring friends to try again
5
Reserved a table for 12 pax to celebrate year end and enjoyed myself in this atas restaurant.Pros:Service is excellentFast response via email for our pre orderFood portion just rightAmbience is cosyCons: quite pricyThanks to the wonderful team of Akira back and my colleagues had a good time today
5
Our 2nd birthday dinner here this year, the place has some pretty unique and delicious Japanese fusion foods, paired with good service and a comfortable ambiance
4
Order the 8 course set @ 99++. Serving is huge. Should be too much for most. Service is great! Starter and dessert were amazing. Mains were okay. Would definitely recommend for thr service and ambience
4
Tuna pizza and pork are good. Portions generally small.Waitress service is good too. Atmosphere is excellen
5
Another superb fine dining experience.. my 4th in three months! Kudos to waitresses too! Very helpful and knowledgeable
5
What I love most about the restaurant would be the interiors and how each cosy table of 4 is set with comfy couches, complete with an art piece hanging on every enclave. But moving on to the FOOD, the sea bass and they miso broth from the lunch set was so delish. Desserts here aren't to "live" for but the plating and effort that goes into presenting each course make up for it :) I need to go back for the rolls
4
Tried every item on the vegetarian menu. Presentation, creativity, and taste of food are great! Love every bite! Except there was a large group hence the noise level was kind of high.
5
This is the fourth time I had been there for meal.. the food never disappoints me, is so fresh and tasty. Service is alway very professional and fantastic.
5
Had dinner with Friend at Akira back, it was a great experience!!! Busy operation but the staffs were very attentive and look after us!! The foods were fantastic and yummy!!! I will sure go back AGAIN!!!!
5
Had one of the best Lunches in Singapore - very Vegetarian friendly (and even Vegan if booking is made well in advance and coordinated with the Restaurant Manger by the name of Edward)Food is fantastic if a bit on the higher side but well worth it.Service was very friendly, professional and highly attentive! A great thank you to our Server Ms. Grace from Korea!Must try(s): Vegan Sushi Platter!! - fantastic use of great ingredients and executionBarley Risotto with mushroom "Scallop" - beautifully fragrant and creamy (even without butter and cheese!!)Taco - creative and amazingly tasty!Chocolate Sorbet - silky smooth texture and bolt bitter sweet flavo
5
We booked Akira Back for a 90-pax global corporate group and we are so glad we chose Akira Back.This world-class celebrity chef (Yellow Tail, Las Vegas) restaurant didn't disappoint.The restaurant team of Johnny, Yanto, and Edward put everything together in a short 3 days, and execution was flawless. They got the chef and team to create a marvellous tasting menu for the guests and everyone enjoyed the wonderful dishes, like the signature Tuna & Mushroom Pizza, AB Taco, Hokkaido Scallop, 48 Hours 'Sanchoku' Short Rib, and Perfect Storm.The food and the service were wonderful. Edward was marvellous with making sure everyone was well taken care of. Everyone really had a great time, with many still talking about it in the following weeks.We'll be back soon
5
Been there a few times by now. Had excellent vegetarian food. They have a vegetrain menu which is great for Japanese cuisine. The Non veg eaten by our friends was also v good. The pricing is mid price is $60 per pax with alcohol and $40 without. which is not bad for Singapore dinning experience
5
First time visit to Akira Back for my wedding anniversary lunch and the service provided to us was excellent. The food served was exceptionally great. Highly recommended tuna pizza as appetiser and sashimi set if you are a sashimi lover. Keep it up! Will definitely visit Akira Back again!
5
Another great find near our hotel, JW Marriott. We went wandering and this menu looked and then tasted fantastic. I recommend the Spicy Tuna Tacos and the Special sushi rolls. Since we were tired, it was great, we put the bill on the hotel room, walked into the elevator to our room. Good night
5
Excellent and quality food. The tuna pizza and mushroom pizza is a must order! To the family, it’s like a Japanese tapas restaurant but we love the food! Sushi rolls and prawn tempura are good. Staff are attentive and friendly! The young one would like to go back again for the pizza and the senior would like to try the weekend brunch.
4
food is very nice, staff also quite friendly. I love the tuna pizza, really creative. The AB taco i choose beef, nice as well. The king crab i found a bit too much sauce. Seaweed salad is refreshing. Overall quite good, the only thing i would complain is the portion toooo small. Two people spent 140sgd but still feel not enough and need to find something else to eat
5
Celebrated my birthday with my family in the restaurant during our staycation in JW marriot. We ordered signature tuna pizza, sushi rolls, set lunch with beef Cheek and they were very flavourful! Thanks for the attention to details as well
4
It's usually full during the weekends so reservation is advised. The food prices are pretty high and the food is quite unique; not the hundred percent Japanese kind of food
3
It was a business lunch with the team. This is a fairly expensive restaurant one could classify—truffle don going for $50 a bowl etc. Wait stuff was commenting inappropriately in response to questions on the menu—almost too casual and in a tone which you’d expect from a $20+ per bowl type of restaurant. Topped with giving me the wrong bill. 3 pax, our bill was SGD255. No alcohol. Quality food Id say, less so the service..
4
the tuna pizza is amazing~i am not very keen on pizza normallybut the pizza is must try one compared to other
4
Had a late evening dinner at this restaurant. It was full but managed to get a place in high table. Very friendly service. Bluefin tuna Shavini is great as well as shrimp tempura. But wagyu fried rice can improve. Desert specially beehive was awesome. Moderately expensive but overall experience was great
4
Excellent food. Sushi we're extremely tasty and fresh. The dish tool was nice with a touch of spicy. Tacos were good but a bit small. Black cod was delicious, but also small portion
4
Great Food, Good Service and Good Food Presentation. Absolutely Enjoyed My Birthday Celebration There
3
Had good food there from starters to sushi and mains. However felt the food service was pretty slow.
5
All the food come from simple ingredients, but give u fabulous flavour and impeccable presentation. We enjoyed the elegant ambience as much as the food itself. Thanks to the employees as well for the hospitality and great service.
4
Ate alone here one night when I was staying at the hotel. There was hardly anyone there and the lighting was pretty low. The food was quite good and there are a lot of choices
5
Upon knowing that it is my wife's birthday, the restaurant kindly offered a complimentary dessert with the Happy Birthday greetings written on the serving plate. What a nice gesture
5
Love the Japanese vegan food these guys cooked up for us. Exceptionally sumptuous and wholesome. Distinctly Japanese with a hint of Western influences. Loved the umami aioli pizza! The Sake n Umeshu pairing hit my sweet spot too. Overall a happy experience with this special vegan community event. Ask for the vegan options if you get here on normal days

@ TheKuoKnowsIt's good to see a new Japanese restaurant in Singapore that doesn't just do ramen, yakitoti or bento boxes.Akira Back, in just a short period of time, has established itself as a force to be reckoned with.The first thing that strikes a diner is the outstandingly simple but effective interior decor. The acoustics are great. The place is ideal for business meetings.The set lunch is quite reasonably priced. The a la cart menu is extensive but not cheap, though. It'svery good, nevertheless.There is an excellent choice of sashimi to whet the appetite. The usual culprits of otoro, maguro, tai and salmon are available. There are more unusual offerings too. The plating up of the fish is aesthetically pleasing.I found the deep-fried aubergines an interesting interlude before my main course of gyudon.To some gyudon may be just beef in a bowl. But Akira Back has lifted the humble street food to new heights with brown rice and a drizzle of truffle oil.Akira Back is an outstanding addition to dining out in Singapore. It is a rising star
5
Visited twice in a week and had a great time on both occasions. First was for dinner which was great. Service staff were attentive and even amusing (rare in SG). The food was delivered promptly and quality was consistent across the different dishes.
4
Its like Japanese food with a twist. Some of the dishes we ordered were pretty good. Some were not so. I kinda enjoyed the sashimi and spinach dish. The pork belly rolls were also very different. Should check out this place
3
The highlights were tuna pizza, Jidori chicken which was tender & flavourful. The signature rolls were average, nothing spectacular.
5
Had dinner at Akira Back! Situated in JW Marriott South Beach! Loved the restaurant, service and of course the food! Simply awesome and value for money.Tried the Chef Akira Tuna pizza, Seared Foie Gras and King crab fried rice! Great restaurant and strongly recommend for family gathering and business dinner!They also serve set lunch at reasonable price too!Dr E. Cho
5
Akira Back isn't cheap but it's worth every penny. I've been there twice and came back satisfied both times. The decor is lovely, the service friendly and attentive and the food is splendid. I forgot to make notes of what I ate but they have a sort of sashimi on a pizza base that's to die for. Highly recommended.
5
First time trying raw tuna in form of pizza! The truffle was so good that I could finish 3 pieces of it! Ambience, service, food...noting I can find fault! Most importantly the company was BEST
5
Experience in AKIRABACKSG is truly enjoyable! The moment you stepped in, you're greeted with the warmest welcome. Service staff was fantastic. Food prepared by the chefs are really amazing. Unforgettable deserts at the end of the meal! Thankful for the wonderful experience!
3
The ambience was great but the food quality is below expectation for the price paid. The salmon sashimi for 2 pieces was for $10 but is not fresh at all. However, the 48 hours ribs is good though.
5
We enjoyed a lovely dinner in a private part of the restaurant. The service was very attentive and the food had a unique twist on Japanese cuisine.
5
Came here for lunch and there was not much crowd. Nice place to dine, quiet and spacious. The tuna pizza is a must try! The pork belly roll as well as the jidori chicken were really good, coupled with the king crab fried rice. Portion is considered small but quality is really good! Good place to bring business associates as well!Even the tea served was quite specially
5
This is third time I have visit this restaurant. Seriously the food standards and service still the best
4
We celebrated my friends birthday in Akira back. There excellent hospitality. My friend was so happy. Thank you
5
Spacious settings. Ambience allows comfortable conversation. Good food that is nice and not overwhelming.
5
They did not have the tuna tonight but I started with a spinach salad (pictured) which was fantastic. I had the rock shrimp hand roll which was amazing (I almost ordered a second one). To drink I tried the Yamabudo-Shu sake....yummy!!!!! Service was excellent.
5
Service was prompt and the food good! The service staff was attentive and cleared our plates the moment we finished our food. The food was also served fast.
4
Enjoyed our dinner at Akira Back, it's at the JW Marriott hotel at beach road .They have a decent vegetarian menu ( it's not on their website , so ask for it ) . Food was nice, would specifically recommend the mushroom tacos . The seating arrangement is staggered , designed in a way that is cheerful yet allows quite time for diners . Service staff were polite and explained the dishes well
4
Service is tip top! Food was enjoyable. Great place for business lunch meetings. Wish there is a larger food selection
5
Fois gras. Sushi. See weed salad.. All of them are perfect.. Can't find any complain.. Taste and service.. Gave me a wonderful experience even though being alon
4
It's our first time to Akira Back, the decor is welcoming and has many type of sittings to cater to different groups of customers. We chose the comfy sofa seats at a nice corner, food came pretty fast which was good as we were very hungry and because of that I only took 2 pics of the food we ordered. The sriracha sauce tempura shrimps are good and can easily pass off as lobster meat. Their signature taco wagyu is great too but this has no taste of Japanese feel though - more of a westernized dish, my husband like it very much though. He ordered the snow crab miso soup and it was nice too. The chu-toro sushi was superb , very fresh and they are generous with serving. We ordered the saga beef don with foie gras and onsen egg, this one nothing much to shout as we had better ones at Murasaki (best for us) and Tetsuya. Overall they are good and I will be back to try more dishes :
5
I would like to thank Johnny Jong, Sales Manager of Food & Beverage for the seamless arrangements leading up to the day of our event at Akira Back and on the actual day itself. Special commendation goes out to Mr Johnny Jong, as he was there to ensure that everything ran like clock-work and was aware of our needs and quick to make the necessary arrangements. The ambience at Akira Back was fantastic and all our guests enjoyed the lovely canapes which were served.On behalf of the Singapore Green Building Council, I would like to commend Mr Johnny Jong for his impeccable customer service and would be thrilled to work with JW Marriott, South Beach Hotel again for future events because of the wonderful experience you gave us during our event from start to finish
5
What superb food, we dined for dinner with a young child and the service and food were excellent.The service was warm and attentive during our 5 course degustation menu. Edward looked after us he was great. The wine list was extensive.Each course was beautifully presented and tasted incredible. Really delicate textures and flavours. They looked after my daughter with an ice cream surprise at the end.Highly recommend 
5
I visited Singapore twice last month. The first time i stayed at the JW hotel and wanted to try the food at Akira Back. Not only was the food incredibly delicious (the sushi, the tacos, the jalapeno hamachi..) but the staff was attentive, welcoming and appropriately spaced out the dishes. A few weeks later I was back in Singapore staying at another hotel but couldn't stop thinking about the food at Akira Back so i went back! Not only was the food as equally delicious but the waitress actually remembered me and did a great job recommending other dishes she thought i would like based on my first experience. While a bit pricey i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! It's superb
5
We went there on a weekend night for a birthday celebration for 2. This was after some heavy bbq lunch celebration earlier, so we were pretty stuffed. The food at AB was intricate, well thought, and was not too heavy. Paired with a nice sake, amidst a romantic ambiance, it was a good evening. Staff were very polite and friendly, and service was prompt. Overall cost was 200++ for 2, a possible place for a celebratory event
5
2nd time back and really enjoy the food. Think Japanese, Korean, & Mexican. Put them all together and you get the unique flavors of Akira Back. We were a group of 10 and did not know how much to order so we asked the staff to plan a dinner for 10. Next thing we know, food kept pouring out of the kitchen, from tacos to sashimi to rib eyes and sous vide chicken breast and finished off with signature rolls. It was way too much for us. I recommend, if you want to do what we did, to reduce the head count. So for a group of 10, I would plan for 7 or 8. That way there's room for desserts. Make sure to include the pork belly roll and you can skip the fried rice. I was too busy eating to take photos of these wonderful dishes. All of them are visually tasty too. Fantastic staff. Very nice and accommodating. Knowledgeable too.For a special night, I highly recommend Akira Back.
4
I went there becase located near my hotel JW marriott, its cozy place, the food was good , a bit expensive but its worth it, i would definately comes back
4
Imaginative and delicious Japanese food with a twist. Uni Sashimi dish superb, as was foie gras dish. Minor complaint staff trying to collect plates when only one person has finished!
5
The tuna/mushroom pizza and chicken main dish is to die for! Very satisfied with the quality of food and the service provided especially by the service crew, Grace (thank you). Will definitely be back again for my pizza
5
The food was very delicious. The service provided was good too by Grace. Highly recommend this place for good Japanese food
4
Celebrated my brother's birthday with dinner at Akira Back. We enjoyed especially the signature tuna pizza with truffle oil, 24-hrs braised beef short ribs and hot mess roll.The service was very good and the staff was attentive and pleasant, especially Joy, whose name suits her aptly as she is always serving with a warm smile
5
Service staff was attentive enough to make sure my green tea level do not go below half cup. We had total 5 dishes : 1.salmon sashimi was thick and fresh !; 2.tuna pizza was thin, crispy, the balance was just nice:); 3.the 48hrs beef was just heaven! umami yum yum. 4. crab legs fried rice have a touch of wok hei; 5. foie gras hand rolls. All in all a great and awesome dinner!
4
Akira Back is daringly different in its approach, attempting to meld Japanese sensitivity with Korean directness. The imagination of the decor is matched by the eclecticism of the menu. We ordered the Tuna Pizza, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Seared Foie Gras and Grilled Alaskan King Crab for sharing. Each dish was a delightful experience. This was augmented by Crispy Pork Belly Wagyu Fried rice which nicely completed the savouries. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service staff made for an enjoyable, memorable outin
5
Came here on a Saturday night. Whole area was quiet but restaurant was bustling. Our first time. We asked the waiter for recommendations. Food was awesome! Well timed, beautifully presented and so so flavourful!! We had the tuna pizza, the special, hamachi jalapeÃ±o, foie gras, special sashimi set, perfect storm maki. Highly recommended!Service impeccable and I loved the electric decor. Now looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other dishes
4
This restaurant is beautiful and the food divine. The plates on the table when you arrive are designed by the owners mother so look out for them - each individual. The kingfish is outstanding as is the long cooked beef. Would love to go back and sample mor
3
Probably no need to return. Portions r too small. Food was good but I am not sure if the whole kimchi sushi style taste matches
5
First time there. Right from the word go, as you enter, staff were courteous. The place was modern and had a great feel to it. Food was brilliant. Although portions were just too small. Everything was fresh. A little pricey but expected from a place like this. Worth another visit
4
I went to Akira Back for lunch twice, both times with friends. The food was very interesting - especially tuna pizza, wagyu tacos and ceviche with a touch of chili. Service didn't disappoint, they gave us enough time to talk and enjoy our food. I will definitely go back
5
Don't leave without ordering this : 48 hrs "Sanchoku" Short Ribs. Wagyu A5 grade. Decadence on a plate.
5
Outstanding Super attentive service! We had a birthday celebration there and everything was perfect!
3
The new South Beach hotel and apartment area is filling up with many interesting looking restaurants, A Back is on the lower floor of the hotel. The layout is odd. We sat at a table for four at the foot of a flight of stairs, far away from any ambiance and with only two other diners. The staff seemed a bit bored. The food is very nice but a bit soulless. Each dish comes with great fanfare (the spinach salad gets mixed at your table) and is tasty and beautifully presented but the entire experience is somewhat less than the sum of its parts
4
For a hotel restaurant, Akira Back delivers an excellent dining experience. The food can best be classified as Japanese Korean fusion with a nod to Mediterranean cuisine. The cold appetisers I had, yellowtail with ponzu sauce and Hokkaido scallop with yuzu truffle sauce & golden kiwi were stonkingly fresh & delicious to boot. There was their take on tacos with wagyu beef in a shell made out of yam that had amazing flavours. My issue with this was that it was messy & the shell when it splintered could result in shards that could cut your gums. My main thankfully did not have such an issue: Tajima beef short ribs slow braised till meltingly tender. The side of beef fried rice I ordered was full of wok breath & had a nice smoky char. Downside was it was a tad oily and left a film of oil in my mouth. Service was attentive & the servers were very friendly. Prices are pricey especially when you're dining alone & want to try different dishes. Still overall it was an excellent lunch on my day off from work.
5
Chef Akira's cuisine is so beautiful, approachable and delicious, we had a great time celebrating my mum's birthday. The team were attentive, professional and precise with our meal down to the last detail. Can't wait to go back
5
My girlfriend decided to make a reservation to celebrate a special occasion and we were definitely not disappointed.The service was exceptional. Attentive and friendly. The food was simply divine. We ordered the famous Tuna Pizza and Wagyu Tacos to start with. Followed by salmon sashimi, Carpaccio and Wagyu Fried Rice. They were all amazing but we especially love the pizza, sashimi and the carpaccio. It was obvious that the ingredients used were top notch and fresh. I could not get enough of the salmon sashimi. The way it melts in my mouth was just exquisite.I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I am looking forward to my next visit
4
Had lunch on 2 occasions in the past month. Chose the daily set and found the taste, presentation and quality to be very good. On the second visit we added a tuna pizza and slices of sashimi to our set lunch. The thinly sliced rae salmon on a biscuit thin pizza bread was delicious.Service is attentive and the interior decoration and ambience all added positvely to our experienc
4
I would say 7/10. Expected more but didn't quite deliver. The tuna pizza and rock shrimp were good though. And service was good too
5
The food was very tasty and service was excellent with very good recommendations! The sesame haven desert is really very nice!
5
The food is worth mentioning as it taste and look great with its presentation. The pizza is a must. Will visit again.
4
Second time going and will definitely be back for more! =) Food and service are both very good. Ambiance perfect!
4
Interesting concept of Korean Japanese fusion but the hot and cold sharing dishes were a little overpriced for their small portion sizes. Taste was average. Service was great though.
5
This place was highly recommended so I thought I must give it a try. So good! I had a nice dry sake along with the tuna "pizza" and jalapeÃ±o hamachi, all recommendations of my server. Fantastic! The pizza is a super thin wafer-like crust with a secret imami aioli coating and layered sashimi tuna. Great food and great service
5
I had lunch with a business associate. LIked the atmosphere. Great service. Food was great. The tuna pizza and sushi rolls we had was pretty outstanding. The seaweed salad less so. Worth coming back
5
Came here with a group of seven and ordered the business lunch specials. The food was truly impressive both in presentation and taste.The only tip: please explain to your waiters that "sorbet" has a silent "t"
5
It's my 1st visit and I must say it was great. The food was tasty. The staff were absolutely polite and the ambience was perfect. What I like most is the way the restaurant is designed. It had lots of privacy although everyone was seated in the open. The music suits the place as well. Must have dish is 'brother from a different mother' as well as a sushi made with brown rice that I cannot remember. Will be back for more
4
We arrive kind of late for dinner with no reservation and we were told that they did not have any table available and that also they had some issues with the rhythm in the kitchen and the orders. I was personally starving and after a quick reading of the menu I decided to insist , pointing that we were staying in the Jw Marriott south beach which is the hotel above the restaurant.Somehow their attitude changed and they offer us a place on the high marble counter . I decided to go for sushi and sashimi and end with a  prawn tempura.Every piece and order was fantastic and the girls serving the table were so nice and kind. I had an amazing meal and a great time with my friend who was experiencing sushi for the first time, and he loved it .This understated gem is 100% worth it to visit and to experience if you are in the area. Make sure to book a table thoug
5
Nice place to have a set lunch. Really enjoyed the food portions. Service was excellent as expected.
5
I emailed in advance to request vegetarian food and they were very accommodating! The food was delicious and we will most definitely be back again. The staff were amazing and could not have been more helpful, Thank you, we had a lovely night!
5
We dinned for lunch choosing sharing platters that are large enough for 4 people. "Hot mess" was a maki with a deep fried crab centre and topped with raw fish and a spicy sauce. Spectacular! Every dish was so good we returned for the 7-course Omakase and again every dish was excellent. We started with a flamunken type pizza bread topped with thin slices of mushroom and tuna. The 48 hour Wagyu was of a melt-in-the-mouth consistency and full of flavour. The staff were prompt and attentive. They have a smooth in-house sake that is special to Akira Back. We loved the experience
5
Had lunch with 2 of my clients some weeks ago and this is a overdue compliments. The mushroom pizza was the best and in fact all dishes we ordered ie Crispy Pork Belly Signature Rolls, 48 Hrs "Tajima" Short Rib, Live Scallop sushi and the Seared Foie Gras is a must to order.The quality of the food and the attentive service of the staffs and managers sum up everything that I would reccommend to this Celebrity Chef Akira Back restaurant to entertainment your business client or casual lunch or dinner.My compliments to the Chef and the service staff for the excellent meal & service! Will definitely come back for more.
3
Ordered lunch sets of sashimi and sushi which was unconventionally presented (in a pleasant way). Ingredients were fresh but there's nothing noteworthy about the taste. On hindsight, may have been a better choice to order less traditional items on the menu in a fusion restaurant to better experience it's intent. Interior was modern and playfully decorated (loved the Miro cushion cases) and service was TOP notched. May visit again to give it another go
5
For being a food and restaurant lover, I love to eat in different types cuisine restaurant to taste and interpret how it's being cook and what's the ingredient that make it an extra edge. Cafe to Fine dine. This new restaurant over at JW Marriott South Beach called "Akira Back" truly the restaurant to dine for. The food has lots of flavors in it as it's a fusion between Japanese and Korean which by far 1st time I came across in Singapore. For sure this will be the upcoming restaurant to dine for. "TRULY RECOMMENDED" Service is precise and well slick. As it's not a really fine dining restaurant, it still go beyond expectation comparing to other semi fine restaurant. "Attention to detail" in every aspect and "rythemise the explaination of product while serving" can be an additional flare to your service, keep it short and sweet. Just a suggestion. But enough said, you guys are there. Thank you Dona for the warmth welcome from the moment we step in, Edwards and Maryanto for making your guest at home.!!

Atmosphere: Semi-bright with warm yellow lighting. Some lamps humorously resemble octopuses. Music grows a few decibels too loud on the ear when the crowd thins out. Bordering on fusion tech: a more soothing genre would be more welcome. Service: Very attentive and solicitous, very warm and friendly, eager to please and make comfortable their guests. Huge thumbs up for this. Food: Excellent piping hot water, smoky hot green tea, their famous thin crusty tuna pizza, and hot fried rice in a stone bowl, with scallops, crab legs, and their $92 sashimi dish graced with an elegant ice sculpture. For separate sashimi orders, a mini ice carving materialises instead. The sake was beautifully sweet.Portions: Miniscule for the price. Quality: Lipsmacking and mouthwatering. Lovely. But the edamame was old, hardened and furried. Have tasted better wasabi. Cutlery: Their “plates” are thin flat, dark grey slabs. Their mini towellettes are expand-upon-soaking ones, unique and memorable for the novelty.Seats: Comfy sofas on a triple-tier. The degree of privacy rises as the tier level drops. Toilets: Two of them, each sparklingly clean and large. A comforting thought especially when you know that it's those toilets where the staff likely use

This was my second time dining at Akira Back.Was yearning for the AB Tuna Pizza and Rock Shrimp Tempura (Sorry to the chef but happy for me to say, reminded me so much of one of my favourite restaurant, Nobu's Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce) that I enjoyed previously.Ordered the Baked Crab hand rolls, Una-Q hand rolls, Ji-dori Chicken and the Chocolate Cup Dessert this time. All were memorable, especially the chicken.The only item that did not suit my palate was the Tuna Tacos, it was too bland.Service was excellent, my warm water was topped up whenever the glass was half full, and they anticipate questions with a ready answer promptly. And the restaurant was almost full house. Frankly, the level of service was on par or even better than a lot of fine dining restaurants in Singapore. Please keep it up!Note : This is a hip but casual restaurant with well executed food and reasonable pricing.

The food are beyond excellent and the service staff are providing excellent personal service where they assign a staff to serve your table. The managers took initiative to have small talk with you and checking on your feedback on the food as well as providing the history of the chef. The ambience and the plates that they used are very extraordinary which we learned from the manager that one of the plate design was the chef mother's painting! We have the tuna pizza, black cod with yuzu foam, truffle teriyaki chicken, crab fried rice, crispy pork roll; desserts we have yuja which is cranberry champagne marshmallow & honey & fresh fruit Penna Cotta. The fried rice paired superbly with Melbac. The tuna pizza is so unique that u wouldn't want to have other types of pizza any more. The price are reasonably priced as well.

We had a quick dinner before drinks at Akira Back...decided to try the Singapore version since the Jakarta one was really good! Firstly Janto took really good care of us. I loved the sous vide chicken! It's tender, juicy, delicious delicious delicious! The aubergine with mozzarella in miso sauce was good too but would pass on the prawn tempura. And tacos with Wagyu was acceptable. But I would go back again for sure!
