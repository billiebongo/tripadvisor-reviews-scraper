It would probably have been an okay place if somebody had bothered to actually serve me. Stood at the bar for five minutes and nobody even bothered to ask me what I would like.

Seafood was not fresh and had a foul smell. I was ashamed and feeling bad towards my family members as it was their 1st visit and i had highly recommended this place as i was very happy during my 1st visit.

For the price of $41.99, you get unlimited seafood and refillable drinks. Basically you just BBQ your own food, not much service. Outdoors with simple setup, nice place to gather with friends. Will recommend.

Causal outdoor dining experience! Seafood quality was good and value for money! Will sure revisit the restaurant with other friends

Seafood provided were fresh but place was disorganised and messy. Short staffed and some foods ran out but staff were helpful and friendly generally. Didn't think it was worth the price though.
4
Value for money, was hot and stuffy though
There is a big field for kids to run around, so even the kids enjoy
3
Food wise quite a number of food variety. But fire safety is questionable and wire mesh is rusty. Maybe suggest to have a change of wire mesh

Arrived earlier than the reservation time but the counter staff kindly let us in and chose our table. However, some of the staff are not very fluent in english therefore we had some trouble communicating but they are all very friendly. Food wise is awesome and very fresh.

good price for seafood BBQ buffet, but that is pretty much about it. Casual outdoor dining, fuss-free, don't expect tables or chairs to be clean. Buffet line can be a little messy with no labels for food. Seating is very disorganised and I'm not how they managed with us making a reservation as non of the tables are set aside for reservations - go early if you want a good table. Its also old-school BBQ and can get very smokey. You will spend a good amount of time during your dinner, setting up and BBQ-ing your food. dress lightly because it can get quite hot as its smokey and outside

Even though we had a reservation, we still had to queue to pay. Disorganized to get to your seats, how to get specific non-standard seafood items. Overall, for the price, freshness of seafood and the hard work of the staff heating the charcoal definitely worth going back

We arrived around 7 PM. They have plenty of tables... friendly attentive staffs, ambiance was perfect with a good sound system and a cooling beer or cold drinks. Highly recommendable.
4
Definitely Great value for the range of seafood and dishes offered. Seafood quality was fresh with a good variety.
4
We complained about the heat from the barbecue, and they went out of their way to make us happy by agreeing to set up the grill on a stand adjacent to our table.
3
Food varieties are above average, limited utensils and condiments. Poor crowd management, insufficient staffs, toilet facilities comparable to public park or probably worse? Recommend to try once only.

Visit was to celebrate son birthday and spread of food was fantastic and the staff were very helpful too.

I would recommend the place to friends. It is good for friend & family gathering. Children can have fun at the spacious grass patch area. I also found out that there are chalets too.
3
Value for money. Better be there early so you can choose a table with fans. Other then that it's kind of "free and easy". Just enjoy the food and your company, nothing else much.

Had been there for 2 consecutive notes with 2 different group of friends. Nice ambience, wide variety of food, choice of drinks & most important the staff were allllll so friendly! Nice place for seafood lovers!

Have been recommending my friends for dinner at The Three Peacock. They loved it so much. However, the lobster included for each person shrink half the size I first went. Rather disappointed. Even told my friends that the lobster is fresh and big but turned up half the size
4
Open space area was cooling at night, location was not convenient and difficult to find. Food was good but have to walk and take your utensils yourself even if you ordered ala carte food items not buffet. We were so confused that why there is no utensils until we asked if we can get some. Everything else was fine.

For the 90s kid who remember those bbq moment during chalet stays. This place up a notch with continuous serving of seafood buffet and charcoal grill! Love the service and dedication too!
5
Good atmosphere and music! Fresh Seafood, it was an awesome experience. The best part of it was the hospitality given by the workers.
5
Good variant of foods for both cooked and raw. Staff will ensure food is being keep replenish.
Although this place is for BBQ but they have enough fans around to keep the place cool.

Initially the experience was bad. Cause it was really warm. But overall experience is great. Seafood were all so fresh ! I had so much crayfish.
3
The lobsters that they provided has a bitter taste. Crabs has a very weird taste too. Some of the seafood there are not very fresh.
5
went there a couple of times and the place is there fantastic. spacious, ambience is great, has a variety of food and the service there is superb! :)
5
Good BBQ seafood and great service! They provided enough bbq pits and helped cooked some of our food.

So I decided to pop the question to my lady after 5 years and of course she said YES! wohoo! Overall the food was amazing and its at a good price for so much of food and good ambience. The staffs were extremely helpful and friendly. They efficiently removed plates and utensils from our tables once they were dirty. We even had one staff who helped us bbq the crabs and lobsters. I decided to have a bucket of 5 bottles of corola extra while my fiancee went for soft drinks and its super worthy!

There are varieties of seafood and meat selection. Alcohol and liquer prices are very reasonable. The place is quite warm and smoky. It is also a hassle when it rains as this is an outdoor setting. Advisable to take a cab if you want to visit as the place is quite inconvenient. Otherwise, good hangout place for friends and families.

Went to The Three Peacock for Xmas Day dinner. Second time there. Seafood BBQ was just as great as the first time - live crabs, fresh prawns, scallops, oysters, crayfish, bamboo clams, and much more plus every pax gets a free lobster (seems smaller than the first time!). There are also cooked food, drinks & alcoholic beverage available - cold beers with BBQ seafood - heaven!Great place for group outings and really value for money too! I would suggest that you make reservations for weekends and holidays. They are open till late with food available even after 10pm and drinks till midnight or later. Parking is free too
