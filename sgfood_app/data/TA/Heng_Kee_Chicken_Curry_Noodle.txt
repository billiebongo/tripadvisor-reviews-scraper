There's line up all the time but usually nothing more than 30 mins. The soup base is so good. Not too salty but very flavoured

Much spicier than Chinese curry noodles that are typically found. Be prepared to sweat it out over the curry ladles over chicken just done right. Heritage food at its best.

Ran into this by accident. Saw a really longline of locals and decided to follow our nosey noses. Well worth the long wait. $7 but good for 2 ladies. Will definitely recommend the place.

I came to this food court looking for another dish but stumble on this curry noodle stall. It turned out to be a discovery of curry noodles. Good curry taste, not too spicy, generous portion and affordable.It would be better if cockles were added as well.In Singapore.....if there's a Q to any hawker stall.....you can be sure it's decent....or...goo

Try to take some chili. The owner and helper both said I take too much chilli. Never encountered this type of 3rd class hawker before. Will never visit again. The Ah Heng Curry Chicken Noodle stall directly on top in level 2 is much much better

This is my first time to eat at this stall after a long break of 5-6 years .Hmm.. It still very delicious n tasty . Curry soup not too heavy or strong. Definitely not that overly spicy that makes you only eat the taste of chilli . Subtle n nice . But somehow I couldn't grab hold of the level of satisfaction I had many years ago . Not sure if it's bcos now the son or next generation is taking over the cooking role .There was still a long q even b4 the start of lunch break . I was at the stall at 11.10 am . I waited for 20 mins n there were 6 people in ahead of me . The cooking style don't seem to change much . Still slow n steady . Still one order taker Aunty n a cook . ( 2 persons role ) If you are in a hurry , I don't think you have the patience to wait that long. But if u have the luxury of time , worthwhile to come down to give a try . N this is a hawker food centre . Non air conditioned . So expect a heat n sweat .. Pricing : $5 small bowl , $7 big bowl .Location : Hong Lim complex food centre- street level stall .

I went to Hong Lim Food Centre for my lunch, and i accidentally saw a long queue at the first floor. Out of my curiosity i joined the queue. While waiting in the line i search bout the Heng Kee Curry in the Trip Advisor and read all the comments given and patiently wait for my turn. And thanks God i joined the queue... For i had found myself a heaven in a bowl.. yes they were right bout the generousity of the tofu and the flavour of the curry not to mention the chicken meat just came off the bone because its so tender. Price range 5-7 bucks per bowl. The queue was worth it. It took me bout 30 min to get my turn. Will come back for more when i am in Spore again.

So long the queue.. like about 60 minutes.. but worth it to try.. best noodle... the aunty like to chat to customer.. while serving.. and they only have 2 person to serve. The chef and aunty.. family restaurant.. the have grade B In singapore restaurant..but people are willing to queue to have this food to eat.. either to eat here.. or having at home.. so love it..

This is the REAL ORIGINAL Chicken Curry Noodle I've enjoyed over 20 years in Hong Lim Complex. Although the Q is always 1 hour long, it's worth the wait & the operation hours are only from 11am to 2pm daily except Sundays & Public Holidays.Try it !!

A very famous Curry chicken mee Stall In Singapore, the white chicken used is very tender and fresh. The soup base is very thick. Tau pok is very crunchy. And also the chilli they used is just suitable for the dish as it is not too spicy yet so fragrance. Expect long queues during the lunch hours as it is located at CBD area. But it is surely worth queueing up! Price is about $5 depending on size and ingredients. Two thumbs up!!
