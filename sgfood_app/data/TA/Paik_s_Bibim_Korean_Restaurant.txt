We ordered the Warm noodles w/ soy sauce and the Teriyaki chicken bibimbap. Portion is good, taste is decent and service is fast. Good choice for quick lunch.

Tried the beef Bibim bap and was not impressed. I preferred bibim bap prepared in a hot stone bowl or when the rice is a little burnt with the nice charred smell. The bibim bap here is served in plastic bowls.

The food has its quality so do the environment. Staffs are friendly and helpful in terms to guide you for ordering since is my 1st time. The patient of the staffs are brilliant and the food was fantastic. Will definitely return.

Their bibimbap is especially delicious as they mix the vegetables with either the beef, chicken, etc. Their soup is also amazing as they do not put any aginamoto.

I am a small eater. Shared Beef Bulgogi Bibimbap, Chicken Teriyaki Cupbabm and Japchae with another friend. Quantity is just nice, not too heavy for me. Quality is good and fresh. Worth the visit and will come back again.

Great for a quick biteCost for 2 is about $25It's very casual, nothing fancy. But does the job well. The portions are also big for the moneyWe had seafood and chicken teriyaki. I highly recommend these 2 flavors. They do not stock coke zero or diet coke. You can buy from a lot of canned juice options thoughJust try once for lunch :

first experience was in NTU's outlet and i love it. it was delicious and very filling. second time i went to Jem's outlet, ordered the chicken and pork bibimbap and the sweet & spicy fried chicken. i personally prefer the chicken bibimbap. two main courses come with 2 free drinks. i noticed the cashier who also prepares the food wearing gloves on both hands also handle money with it. perhaps his purpose to wearing gloves was to keep his hands clean instead of the hygiene.

*Usually I went to NTU branch, so no idea how's the situation for other branches*I like the most of chicken teriyaki bibimbap, taste really good and crispy! Secondly I like the beef bibimbap. Going to try the pork bibimbap soon. Most important is the hot pepper sauce, nothing special if you eat without it

I brought my colleagues to citilink paik's for a quick lunch for the first time. I took the tray to carry soup, kimchi, wallet, phone and 2 Canned drinks to a table. The waitress who is taking order yelled at me in front of my colleagues for taking the tray before the main dish was ready. It wasn't a busy period and it totally ruined my mood for the day. I asked her whether she had to yell at me for one tray and she continued scolding me insisted that I didn't listen to her commands. My colleagues said that she kept yelling and her saliva went into the food and this wasn't hygenic. I will never frequent this place again. Very unpleasant experience. The coffee section of this branch is more friendly.

Tried at a Paik's BiBim @ Tiong Baru Plaza and also @ Jem.The Food is simplistic, delicious and traditional. Its as good as u see and as good as what you eat at the same restaurant in Korea.Most Important fact is that Its very affordable and Value for money.Even my 2 son that don't like vegetables wanted to eat the Beef and Chicken Bibimbap with all the vegetables every week.Recommend to take the set of 2 main course and 1 side dish to get 2 free drinks. at Below 23 Dollar
