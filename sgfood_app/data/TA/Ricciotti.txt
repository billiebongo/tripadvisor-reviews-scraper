Visited Ricciotti for a weekday lunch. Wasn’t crowded, service was quick, ambience was great. Food was alright. Charged $7 for still water, they don’t serve tap water.
5
Fantastic restaurant. Very friendly and professional staff, high quality ingredients, best pizza in Singapore after 10 years of looking! Other meals delicious too.
4
Nice place if you want a hint of Italian pasta and not too expensive. Nice pasta, done just right. Staff was nice and helpful.
4
We called in for a late lunch. The staff were friendly and helpful. The pasta was good and our starter was also tasty. Not too expensive and was value for the quality.
4
Dropped in for late dinner and nothing to fault. Pizzas and risotto were excellent, drinks reasonably priced (it was happy hour) and children entertained by making their own pizzas. Overall a great experience.
4
This morning we stopped here for a drink. We sat inside, under the ceiling fans, where we still had an excellent view of the river. A very efficient, friendly waiter served us an apple juice and an Aperol spritz. A lovely, relaxed place for a mid-walk rest. Next time we are in Singapore we would certainly consider coming here for lunch
1
The Caesar salad at Ricciotti is the worst Caesar I've ever had. The chicken had no flavour (it didn't have grill marks on it) and the dressing was yellow, thick and had 0 taste. I paid 27$ for a terrible salad and bottle of water (because they don't serve tap water, and there isn't a drink less than 5$ on their menu.) Don't waste your money here. They also had only two people working on the floor (not even a bartender) and the quay is particularly busy with Chinese New Year
3
We called here for an evening meal following an evening 'Singapore River Experience'Lovely quiet waterfront location with friendly staff.Chicken Pizza - 6/10Bacon, Egg, Mushroom and Cheese Pizza - 8/10Sea Bass - 8/10A bit of a disappointment - there were only two meals with chicken in it - one was a pizza.£

My girlfriend and I decided to eat here on the evening we visited Clarke Quay. We wanted a nice meal before enjoying a few drinks at the different bars. We ordered the sharing pizza with choice of 3 toppings and every slice was absolutely delicious. The pizza is made as it is in parts of Italy we have visited with fresh ingredients and no reliance on lots of sauce. There was loads of veggie options on the menu and the wine we had was great. We also had gelato for dessert and it was amazing. Service was great! They didn't pester you and knew when to come to the table and when to leave you to eat
2
Service was a little slow early on Saturday evening. We were a table of two and my partner's food arrived, followed by mine five minutes later. The manager placed my meal on the table and said he would provide a reduction for the wait. Bill arrived, no reduction and when queried with the manager he denied saying this. Funny that, I've never imagined hearing the words 'reduction' before. After an unpleasant discussion which was embarrassing for the restaurant, us and other customers he returned with a slight reduction on the bill... to only want to start denying and arguing again. The cons outweigh the pros for this restaurant. When Singapore has so much to offer choice, I'd save your money.
4
We are glad that Riciotti has introduced a set lunch menu which is quite good value. The food is yummy and we love the service. The tiramisu is fantastic! Wish the acoustic was better though!
5
Amazing Italian restaurant!!! High level food and the dishes look amazing!!!
I had the Carpaccio and the Ravioli with bufala!!! Homemade pasta and the quality was unbelievable!!!
And the Asian waiter speaks a little bit of Italian as well!!!!
4
Had a nice family gathering outside (it can be warm if you are not use to Singapore heat) with a small view of the water. The food and selection of wines were outstanding. The wait staff are very accommodating.
5
Food is fantastic.Dishes are well presented and for the first time in quite a while, I see a restaurant plan their serving time to get all dishes on the table at the same time. That's much appreciated.Presentation is great, dishes are colorful and original.Will go back for sure.

My husband, myself and our two teenage sons dined at Ricciotti as we were craving good pizza. This restaurant is about as Italian as you will get in Singapore, it genuinely appears authentic and even the wait staff have strong Italian accents. It's located riverside and whilst the interior is very pleasant, they also have outdoor seating with views of the river. We ordered 9" pizzas ($16-20) and very much enjoyed them. The complimentary selection of bread items was much appreciated and very nice. Drinks are not cheap but boy, the red wine we had was good! Service was efficient and attentive
5
We visit Singapore on numerous occasions and came across Ricciotti restaurant on this trip.Situated on the far end of Clarke Quay towards Boat Quay we were not disappointed with our visits.We stopped for lunch and both shared a Pizzotto Pizza which would have to be one of the nicest Pizza's we have ever had.We decided to come back for our evening meal and both the Salmon and Argentinian Sirlion dishes were excellently prepared.The staff are very friendly and their service was second to none.It is also worth mentioning the rest rooms which would have to be the cleanest I have ever seen in this sort of establishment.We will definitely return when next in Singapore.
1
We went to this restaurant for dinner on 18 May. After ordering our food, we were asked "What drinks do we want to order?". We said we wanted hot water, but the waiter told us they stopped serving hot water and tap water. We informed the waiter that we don't mind paying for hot water as we prefer to drink water that is warm. The waiter went back to check with his supervisor and came back to say it will cost us a whopping $5/-! This is ridiculous and decide not to eat at this restaurant
5
We were looking for somewhere to have coffee and dessert after my partners birthday dinner further up the river, my partner wanted Icecream and coffee so we asked at Ricciotti and they were very friendly and there were seats inside in the air conditioning.The staff were very friendly and the Icecream and coffee were extremely tasty.We enjoyed the service and quality of the icecream and coffee so we decided we would go back for a meal the next night. Again we were welcomed and and seated straight away inside, the table we chose had a bit of water on it, so the waiter advised us we should move as the air conditioner was leaking, we shared a pizza, what we thought was garlic bread but had no garlic on it, icecreams, 2 cans of coke and coffees, all up it cost us 74.15 SGD.The only complaint we had was the wait between our meal and getting dessert as it wasn't busy.we will be back on our next visit to Singapor
2
Who can say no to $8++ whiskey (5-8PM)? Service was excellent too, but I have one major gripe. It's good that you inform your patrons that 8PM is approaching, & that if they have any last orders, they should do it soon because the system is very rigid.But with that, also, I would expect that if my order was too late to be keyed in for the happy hour promotion, I would be informed of it before the order is processed? I mean, don't keep quiet about it? Ended up being charged full price for the last 2 glasses of whiskey. Ironic, since we were being rushed for this last order to try to beat the clock. If we had known we wouldn't have made it in time, we wouldn't have ordered them the first place. In all, go for this if you aren't rushing to beat the clock. & if you're in doubt about whether you can beat the clock, just don't place that order

We have an "official" family date that we will try out a new restaurant for our family dinner once every month. It was our neighbour's recommendation to Ricciotti at Riverwalk. We had a great experience. Food was really good tasting and the service staffs was not only helpful with choice but also attentive. Dropped my napkin on the floor and seconds later, I was offered with a new one without me even noticing where he comes from. We really like the soup and the appetizer we ordered though the mains were equally good. The strong aroma of truffle oil in the black forest mushroom soup was one of the best I ever had, not to mentioned the mouth watering Carpacio di Manzo. Our meal was complete with Soffiato and 2 scoops of Gelato ice cream. Everything was good. I supposed we can go back to try out other items on the menu
4
Cozy and central restaurant in Singapore, lovely Italian cuisine and wine, nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I had a fantastic risotto as per chef's suggestion. It is nice to find such places this far from Italy! Congratulazioni!
5
My find of food. Light and healthy.Mostly!! Great sitting outside in the fresh where its still comfortable and not sweaty.Fabulous attentive service.
4
We've always liked the food at Ricciotti and it has a really great chilled out vibe by the river. It's never to busy which suits us great because it's a good place to chat and enjoy the area. The food is also top notch, never had a bad meal there. We'll definitely be going back but I'm surprised that they've started charging for water...that certainly wasn't the case the last time we went last year..
5
We went here last Saturday night for dinner It was my daughter's 15th Birthday and the group of girls had a table for themselves. The wait staff could not have been more attentive to their table or ours. Service was very fast but we never felt rushed. They helped with the cake that we brought in and were terribly charming to us all. Food and pasta were excellent. Several of the girls are vegan and they're was no problem at all. Their pizza was outstanding and it is not easy to find great pizza in Singapore, especially at a reasonable price. We highly recommend Ricciotti
3
Ricciotti is an Italian restaurant located on the river side between Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. In an area full of 'pub grub' and bar snacks it makes for a more satisfying choice of restaurant. The pizzas are good, the pasta ok, but it's on the expensive side for what it is
5
As a very frequent traveler sometimes I need to taste home food. At Ricciotti's I had a good simple salad with aceto balsamico and olive oil extra vergine. Then homemade tagliatelle with salmon. Really "al dente". Ricciotti is a perfect place for Italian food experts. Gabriel and chef Matteo know very good the secrets of Italian cuisine and are very nice guys.
3
This cosy restaurant is located on the Riverwalk. We had a nice outdoor table. Our startes were excellent, the pizzas were good, but nothing special. The staff was gentle but did not seem to be used to be busy, so we spent a lot of time waiting and waiting. But nevertheless, if I come back to Singapore I may give the restaurant a try again, as the food ordered by the guests next to our table looked delicious. and as already written our starters were excellent
5
We happened upon this restaurant while walking along the Riverwalk in Singapore. We were given a lovely table nearest the river from where we could people and boat watch. Lovely Italian cuisine and wine, nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Definitely go bac
2
its Valentines Day, even though we made reservation and the restaurant still has other empty tables, we were made to sit next to a shelf of wines. Since the occasion, many people ordered wine.. so the waiters just kept coming over, stretch their hands across our table to grab the bottles - disrupting our conversations so often. Food was also pretty bad. I didn't enjoy any bit of the 4 dishes that we ordered
4
Went there during the Chinese New Year. We ordered the seafood spaghetti, the grilled octopus and granchio pizza. The food was good. Especially the roasted octopus. It was so fresh and cooked at the right tenderness. The Granchio Pizza consists of crab meat, mussels, clams, calamari, prawns. It portion of the pizza comes with each seafood ingredients. Taste very good and fresh. The seafood spaghetti came with fresh prawns, calamari, mussels and clams in tomato sauce. It was very tasty and good
4
Its been a while I last visited this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised that it looks contemporary after its revamped
Ordered the Duck Carpaccio & Baby Octopus set meal - yum!
Servers was efficient & friendly too :)
5
Super place for drinks with huge collection of whiskey but a splendid spot for lunch excellent food and super pizzas. Excellent service a must place for any Italian visitor and for anybody liking a relax but good place
5
I thought the ambience was lovely, and the food was gorgeous. They did the doneness of my meat perfectly, and i can't really find any fault. The service was great, genuinely nice people. I love it!
4
On the Riverwalk, we sat for a while enjoying a couple of glasses of Italian wine and pizza, while watching the world go by. Staff were welcoming and in no hurry to move us on, so it was a very relaxing hour spent at the side of the river
4
Authentic Italian cuisine. However, complimentary tap water was not available, which we found unusual for a fine-dining restaurant. Decent customer service. Enjoyed the desserts in particular (folded Nutella wrap and tiramisu)
5
Very good Italian restaurant situated on the Riverwalk in the area of Boat Quay and Clarke Quay in Singapore. We ordered the fried Calamari and the Carnivore Pizza. Both dishes were very good and tasty. The service was also very good and the price reasonable for the area. It is a welcome alternative compare to the many Chinese restaurants on the riverside. They have a happy hour special for the drinks between 5PM and 8PM
5
We found this place wandering around and were not disappointed. Great venue, very nicely done out, excellent service from start to finish. Sat inside watching the chefs making the pizzas, had an exceptional starter recommended by our wonderful waiter then had 2 fabulous pizzas, perfectly cooked, thin base and lots of tasty toppings. Not cheap for pizza but where is now in Singapore?! Highly recommend
4
We visited on our last night in Singapore, and loved the location on the waterfront. Our waiter, Julian, was charming and attentive, and provided excellent service. We shared a basket of bread and tomato/mozzarella salad for starter. The bread was warm and the mozzarella creamy and well seasoned. We each chose one of the pasta specials for main - I had a delicious dish of pappardelle with beef in red wine sauce, whilst my husband had home-made chicken ravioli in a mushroom broth. The desserts were the star! Mine was panna cotta with chocolate soil and drops of salted caramel, whilst my husband's tiramisu was rich and tasty.The only downside was that wine was very expensive at $18 per glass, but overall we left very satisfied with our dining experience
3
My favorite is the "half/half", where you can mix 2 pizzas of your choiceGreat selection of tastesGood accessibility Service is correct and efficientNo booking needed for a small groupBut the bill is relatively expensive for a pizzaEnjoy your pizz

A little hard to find. We parked at The Central (reasonable parking price) and took a pleasant 10 minute stroll along the river and under the New Bridge Rd bridge (which has great mural art along both walls). "The River Walk" is actually the building that fronts onto the riverside promenade and faces Boat Quay. The Riverwalk building, and the Riverfront apartments next to it, back onto Upper Circular Road between New Bridge Rd and North Bridge Road. There's an entrance/exit to Clarke Quay MRT station in the Riverwalk, which is probably a good alternative means of transport.Yes, nice restaurant/bar area with cool air-con inside, and a pleasant Al Fresco area to watch the people walking (and exercising) by the river.The staff were very attentive and the Italian chef made numerous appearances, posed for photos, and spoke passionately about the food he prepares.That said, we agree with other reviews about the prices. The Antipasti platter was expensive (the chef made it for us so we didn't know what it would cost until the bill came) and less exciting than others we've enjoyed. Main courses were great. It was Truffle season, so two of us had the Ravioli with a generous serving of black truffles - worth the price. I'm always disappointed when restaurants don't offer complimentary tap water... after all, this is Singapore: hot and humid! People need to drink water (not for the label, or even the supposed taste, but because water is actually beneficial - especially when consuming food and/or alcohol) - Obviously, restaurants such as this one make money from thirsty customers ordering the "branded water" or other drinks (and if you don't look at the prices, the drinks bill can exceed the food bill quite easily.) We were there on a Friday night and the place had started to empty out by 9pm.Perhaps if water was "free flow", it might entice happy, hydrated customers to have an extra alcoholic drink, more food, or even just linger a while longer....?! The presence of customers in any of the places along Clarke Quay/Boat Quay always makes restaurants more attractive to passers-by
5
We had a beautiful dinner here - the food was superb and the service excellent! Highly recommend as an affordable yet delicious option in a lovely setting
5
It is sorrounded by all you can eat places, but this place is lovely. Nice terrace on the river...I ordered 2 chefs recommended dishes and was not disappointed. Nice wine list as well. It merits a visit
2
Good stuff first - attentive and efficient service and very tasty Caprese salad. Next, the OK stuff - the carbonara. Then the not so good stuff - wine prices range from too expensive to downright ridiculous ($360 for one wine), portion sizes are too small, no bread served, no pepper or parmesan with the meal, and no tap water. In general the prices are too high for what's on offer, and it just feels like the business is profit optimising to the max
5
Very good food, lovely ambience and friendly staff. Love the crabmeat linguine and marinara, fresh and tasty! Food is more on the expensive side but i think its worth it:) by the way i love the way they plate their food
2
Food was not that bad, i had nice pasta, my wife had ravioli, she sayd it was a bit dry inside but still tasty, my friend had risotto, and he did not like it, and another friend pasta with crab meat and she did not like it either.But the rip off was the antipasti, we asked to put together 3 antipasti for sharing among us.The small plate that we received was enough for 2 persons, one small burrata, a few slices of salami, mortadella and ham, 6 cherry tomatoes and rucola, and a very small portion of salmon and fishsword carpaccio, bill for this plate was over 80$... unbeliavable.So if you go order antipasti to be plated separately.However there are better italian places in town for much cheap
3
Ok - this is a review of two halves - we fancied Italian, checked on TripAdvisor and this looked promising.We chose a bottle of the Prosecco Millesimo Superiore, after discussion with the owner / manageress.And delicious it was too and so should it have been at $ S 70 per bottle.I chose Pollo Milanese for my main. It was served with spinach and roasted cherry tomatoes .I asked if I could substitute the spinach ( which I hate ) , they offered mashed potato - ok by me.My husband had Fish Stew. He enjoyed it.My Milanese was fine, the potato was ok. Coldish by the time it arrived, the cherry tomatoes were just cold, sliced bog standard tomatoes - certainly not cherry.The only courtesy check was when my husband had finished his meal and she took the bowl asking how the meal was.I commented that roasted cherry tomatoes was not what I got.We then waited around 10 / 15 minutes in a 1/4 full restaurant, hoping to be offered the dessert menu, no one came near us.At this point we totted up the bill , left what we thought was the correct amount plus 10 % ( fairly undeserved service charge )on the table and left.I now realise that we did not include the alcohol tax, so technically we did not leave enough. However all in all we feel they did ok, and we did ok.Should the management want to respond to my review I will happily send the small amount owing.( check my other reviews, this is not what normally happens
5
Italian owner from Milano is friendly and pleasant. Try the Pistache Ice cream in the bar/lounge - a dream
3
I ordered the two-course set lunch today. Bruschetta for the first course and the tuna puttanesca linguine for the second course. Overall the food is only "okay" quality. The food is quite bland. The tuna in the pasta was overcooked and dry, and tasted very fishy. The pasta was al dente, but overall more seasonings was needed
5
The restaurant has outside seating right next to the river, just before Clarke Quay. The waiters were polite and helpful and the food was delicious. The seafood risotto was great and my boyfriend had the ravioli in a veal jus which apparently was the best meal he has ever had - not bad!
5
Took my inlaws to this lovely place for dinner after hearing good reviews from friends... Must take a table in the open riverwalk area... Beautiful setting... The vegetable soup was outstanding... It's a meal by itself... Even the pizza was very good... The gnocchi in tomato sauce was average... And the tiramisu was just yumm...loved it
5
Jean Franco is a fantastic restaurateur. Leave the menu aside and let him late you on a fantastic culinary journey. I take clients here regularly and have yet to be disappointed.
4
The pizzas at Ricciotti are very good. The Gorgonzola a Pancetta pizza I had was very tasty and the option to have 9" pizza for lunch is perfect.
4
The pizza was super good...Must try♡♡And of course the pasta and risotto as well...♡♡I be back for more food and desserts
4
Bored of seafood, we search something different and, as Italians, we choose to have a dinner at Ricciotti.
Good choice !!
Beautiful location, pleasant atmosphere, nice staff and good food.
Just, please, the next time cook the pasta few second less :-).
4
Visiting Thai gf wanted Italian and since I've heard so much about Ricciotti from my foodblogger friends Fatsochef, I decided to hit the resto. They do take reservation online but for faster result, I would suggest the old fashion way of picking up the phone and dial.For a more lively atmosphere, I would opt for alfresco where you can see the waterways and watch the world go by. Unless you're the kind that melt in any heat... The staff are very attentive and ever ready to help with your enquiries. I suppose it helps too if you know the MD.... :)The cuisine selection is really lovely. Do please try:- FOR APPETISERS: Polpo e Burrata (grilled octopus served with Burrata), fried coated calamari served with spicy arrabbiata sauce, Burrata e Prosciutto di Parma 20 Mesi (20 months aged Parma ham with Burrata).- FOR MAINS: Ossobuco e Gremolata (braised veal ossobuco served with Parma ham sauce and beef bone marrow gratin)And do try their selection of homemade breads dipped with some olive oil and balsamic...- FOR DESSERTS: Please please try the Gondola alla Nutella ( which is a folded Pizza Dough shaped like a boat and filled with Nutella, Mascarpone and hazelnut)!!
3
Went for weekend lunch so that it'll not be crowded. Menu was awesome... We ordered calamari, pizza, pasta ( spaghetti Carbonara!!!-- a must) and its really good. Will come back and recommend this resto.
3
I have been visiting this outlet for over 7 years because of relaxed ambience by the river. The foods and services were much better before the renovation. Now the concept is less family friendly but more for drinking parties. The pizza is still good but the rest of the food is not the same. Sad to see the quality of one of my Favourite Italian restaurants in town dropped. The service staff also look glum and hardly smile
4
We stumbled upon this restaurant as we couldnt get in to Jumbo nearby. We were happy we did. The staff and the new chef Matteo Ponti were great. We ordered pizza, pasta & antipasti which included a section of fish and meats. Matteo offered to place the order for us and whilst we can pick an 'upsell' we were happy to oblige. The food was fresh and tasty and authentic Italian. The series were adequate sizes not being too large or too small. The price point was on the expensive side and as with all Singapore restaurants the price of wine was exorbitant. That didnt stop us from ordering 3 excellent bottles of Pinot Grigio from Italy to wash down our pizza which was cooked like in Napoli and the pasta al dente. We wish Matteo well with his new venture and recommend the restaurant to anyone wanting a change from asian food whilst in Singapore.
4
I went to this place so many times. The main reason to go so many times is their dessert "Soffiato" which is my favourite. It is simply yummy
5
A group of us decided to try out Ricciotti as a change.I haven't been back here in many years and had forgotten About this little gem. They have totally remodeled since mylast visit and I was pleasantly surprised by the layout.Very friendly staff with good attentive service and TOP notchFood quality isn't easy to find all in one place in Singapore.Ricciotti's scored in all aspects. Thank you very much for a reallynice evening!!!Paul
5
We enjoyed our meal so much and really wanted to avoid a 'deli belly' so ate here both nights. Not very adventurous I know but it was worth it. Food was fab and the staff were really friendly.
5
This restaurant was delightful to visit. The owner and waiters were wonderful and the food was delicious.
3
We stopped here for a meal on one of the last nights of our Singapore holiday. We were wandering along busy Clarke Quay looking for somewhere to eat, and Ricciotti looked good; it's right on the waterfront, with good vegetarian options on the menu. Unfortunately the service was only average, and the food itself was nothing special. One slightly annoying thing is the positioning of the overhead lights and fans; at some of the tables you get a "strobe" effect from the blades of the fan passing in front of the lights, which is distracting.Anyway, the food is reasonably priced, the location is good - worth a visit, but there are better dining options nearby. Try Bacchanalia on Hongkong Street; it's by far the best of the restaurants we tried in Singapore
2
Our lunch was good and service was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone was very nice to us. However, we could not help but notice that the table next to us got shockingly poor service. We overheard the exchange between the waiter and the Asian family whose daughter had asked (very politely) about why their drinks were sweet when they had ordered unsweetened. He first denied it was sweet, then said how would he know, it was made in the morning and maybe someone had added sugar. And if that wasn't cringingly rude enough, he said "what do you want? If you ask for another one, I will just give you from the same batch."We found it really appalling and uncomfortable to witness such shocking service. But those diners didn't leave, so maybe they didn't mind? We did. Probably not coming back.
3
Located along Clarke Quay mass of competing restaurants.Open for over 10 years this joint must have had a recent refurb as its high quality fit-out still looks pristine.Attentive service with food served quickly - due to small number of diners. The tuna salad was really an excellent salad nicoise with quail eggs, tomatoes on dressed lettuce with shavings of parmesan. The salmon was smallish (compared to Australian portions) but was adequate although the skin could have been crisped more.Good place to eat and inside is quiet
5
We liked it so much we visited twice, for dinner and then lunch the next day. This is a lovely restaurant serving great Italian food with Peroni on draft & reasonably priced Italian wines (for Singapore). We had the Chicken Milanese, Penne Arrabiatta, Tiramisu, Pizza and the Eggplant/mozzarella starter. All dishes were excellent and service was friendly and efficient. Highly recommended
5
The restaurant is right on the river in Boat Quay and easily accessed from the Riverwalk entrance on the back side or from the river bank side. Lots of great pasta choices. Service was helpful in recommending dishes and very friendly. perhaps one of the best pasta places in Singapore
5
Dropped into Ricciotti as we were passing around lunchtime. Starter - aubergine parmigiana - and both mains - carbonara and bolognese - were delicious, as was ice cream with espresso poured over the top. Nice prosecco and cranberry stritz to accompanyGood relaxed atmosphere, good service and good rest roomsCouldn't ask for more!
3
Place is really nice and food is good too. Nothing too fancy and price is ok. Best part of the meal was lovely dessert.
3
This is a place that I've visited on many occasions, mainly for the location and the fills a hole type food.Let's start with the food. For an Italian restaurant it's nothing special that's why I usually go for a pizza which is better than average. The pasta dishes are a bit hit and miss, though the spaghetti vongole is nice; however, the portion sizes don't warrant their price tag. The other main course choices don't in the main reflect true Italian cuisine. The cod certainly isn't cod, but some other random fish as my wife found out. The tiramisu and panacotta are a nice end to the meal. I do feel that the food is overpriced for what it is.This leads me onto the staff. There appears to be more managers than staff who in my opinion don't seem to do a lot. As in most Italian restaurants when the owner appears they usually speak to the guests which gives that personal touch, this isn't the case here, in fact I would describe the owner as ignorant. The standout member of staff is Mark who is always attentive and happy to deal with any requests you may have.Overall this isn't a bad place, but it could be so much better with a few tweeks to the food and the right staff.Will I continue to go there? Yes, the location is great, Mark is fantastic and I like the pizzas
4
We were here in New Year's Eve for dinner. Despite the restaurant being packed, the service was good. The pizza were good and so was the cray fish linguine
5
Excellent pizza, hearty salads, fantastic pasta, all dishes taste fresh and delicious.
Service is attentive, prices are reasonable.
Good selection of wine.
Bar is well equipped.
5
we decided to try Ricciotti after reading the reviews and also fancied italian .We had a great table by the river sevice was excellent from Gianfranco and his team all in all highly recommende
5
A friend suggested going to this part to relax and have a drink, after wandering around in the heat for awhile, we went looking for a place to sit and chill out whilst they were finishing work. Loosing the will to live, we found this at the end after coming from under the bridge.It was great, comfy chairs, great wines and I don't think over priced. The WiFi had a great connection.We had an Italian meat board and spaghetti they were fantastic.Service spot on. Restaurant inside which looked great, all very clean too.Will definitely come back here
3
I have been here and food is good. Waiters are kind but insistent.Appetizer+pasta +salad+beer+water+coffee = 112 SGD.Environment is just good
5
The ambiance is casual and very nice, the location at The Riverwalk is fantastic, the food is very good and prices not so high for Singapore.Nice the idea to have the 2 sizes for pizza, the smaller one if you are not very hungry, the 12" standard size for Italian pizza, which is a thin, crusty one, very tasty.Very nice the Viola beer, from an Italian micro brewery
5
We have visited Singapore many times and have always stayed in close proximity to Clarke Quay on a short stopover , maybe 2 or 3 nights stay. Its incredibe that each time we dined it was either in China town or Clarke Quay. By chance we walked through the underpass from Clarke Quay to Boat Quày for the first time!! At first we passed this place and thought it was just a bar. It had a big television screen playing sport and we passed by. ON our return, still looking for somewhere to eat, we were approached by a very pleasant young man who was Vietnamese I think his name was Nick. He had such a good manner and good sense of humour. When i aproached him to ask if this was a restaurant. It was his manner that pursuaded us to give it a go. We instantly felt welcome and that our custom was appreciated. We were so surprised that there was a good Italian restaurant hidden @behind serving freshly cooked pizzas and various Italian dishes which were delicious and affordable! We ordered the squid starter that came with wine when it was happy hour and it was delicious! More than that when we returned ,we were recognised and appreciated. We can not praise this place enough!The main course was delicious. Another night having eaten a little street food elsewhere we returned there for a cheese p!atter and some wine. They have a menu catering for all. It was nice to see young couples eating affordable pizzas. Outside young familieswere feeling comfortable eating pizzas with very young children. We are older and well travelled and found the resaurant service sophisticated, good value fot its position in Singapore , and thoroughly enjoyed this place. The two front of house staff were excellent!! One Italian speaking and one Vietnamese. The boss took time to màke us feel welcome too!Will definitely return on our next visi
4
Good options for italian food. Vegetarian option are also available with genuine Italian flavour and toppings. Try topping of eggplant.... its fantastic
5
Right on the river at Clarke Quay, Ricciotti is quite a cool place to eat and drink at night. During the day it's fairly quiet and nice place to sit back and take in the atmosphere of quay district - only on the slightly posher side !I had a late lunch with a couple of glass of very nice Sauvignon Blanc. The raw tuna salad was delicious and very filling. Highly recommended
5
Ricciotti has it all! Great location, beautiful view, friendly staff and best of all, delicious food and wine. I visited with a large group of friends and we were in good hands from the moment we arrived. With an elegant yet relaxed atmosphere, the tone was set for a great night. The manager took excellent care of our group, with wine pairing for our menu selection. The appetizers, pizza and pasta were made with fresh ingredients and seasonings. The staff were attentive and helpful. Highly recommended! Ask for Gianfranco, the Italian manager, and you will surely enjoy your dining experience at Ricciotti.

Fabulous place, very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Excellent food and drinks. Very recommendable. Nice scenery alongside river walk.
5
Excellent service and delicious food. Especially the pizza. Quiet expensive (as every restaurant at The Quays), but the food is worth the price. Ricciotti offers a large pizza (2-3 person) which is totally enough for 2 person and it is affordable.
4
We went to Ricciotti last night and had a great time. We both ate pasta, one with seafood in a paper bag and second was carbonara with fried polaenta. All washed down with a good bottle of red wine. The bill was very reasonable for the high quality food.
4
Who would’ve thought you would get such amazing Italian food in Singapore!We enjoyed a lovely lunch here in the afternoon sunshine. The pizzas were perfect – thin, bubbly crust – and the pasta portions were generous. Great value for money at a lovely spot at Clarke Quay
2
Two of us were at the restaurant for lunch and ordered the seafood pasta. We sat there for half an hour before the food arrived. Our drinks were not served too. The pasta was too salty and too hard, it tasted horrible. The bill came to around $60 for the two pastas.We will never be back.
4
I have to say the pizza is very good at Ricciotti (not cheap though...)! I also like the design of the interior and the terrace is nice (at least the low chairs and tables). The only minus point is that the service could be improved, and could add a touch of Italy !Overall good food for a good central location: you can go 
5
I know that's a big statement, but it really was! You must try the truffle with quail eggs pizza, it is to die for! We had a mix of 3 and they were all amazing though. The service was good enough but nothing special. We got seated quickly and got the things we wanted when we wanted them, but more smiles would have been nice :)The restaurant itself is attractive, we sat semi outside with a view of the river, and the inside is nice and modern. I would recommend this place 100%, we will be back to try the pasta to see if that's also the best ever! ;
3
The pizza was expensive but ok with nice garniture and well cooked. However, The pastas were far from good... how disappointed we were... we tasted lasagna, crabs pasta and gorgonzola gnocchi : all average, no taste.Nice service and very nice situation
4
This restaurant has a large menu and has excellent views of the river.I had grilled octopus and my wife had spaghetti carbonara, both were delicious and reasonably priced (for Singapore). The octopus was the most tender I have tasted.On a Friday evening they have live jazz provided by two musicians

Passed by for dessert after dinner with the missus. Was slightly humid so we opted to sit inside, which was empty. I used to come here before the major renovation that turned it from a delicatessen/bakery to a fully fledged restaurant. Back in the day you could have your choice of dessert at 50% off once it hit a certain time. We knew we weren't getting that deal again so no problem. We informed the staff we were just there for dessert and they brought us the menu to look through. I was a little disappointed that they only had about 8 or 9 items to choose from. I guess that's not a low number of desserts but they used to have so many more. We opted to have the Soffiata (sp?) a chocolate lava cake served with ice cream. Was a little disappointed when it arrived as it was not served the way it was pictured. The picture showed two scoops of ice cream on a white circular dish but it only came with one. OK, no big deal. It came on one of those glass type rectangular dishes that artsy fartsy places like to use to make it look 'higher' class and also used for canapes and finger food. Presentation wise not an issue. It looked good. The problem came when trying to eat it. This glass type material is not very conducive to picking things up with a spoon. When you try to scoop up either the cake or the ice cream it just slides around the 'plate' rather than getting on to the spoon and in to your mouth. After several attempts we gave up and took a fork from the next table to push the ice cream and cake on to the spoon. The lava cake was nice. Moist, flavoursome and not overly sweet. The ice cream was also nice. A hint of vanilla and some shards of chocolate. All in all, not a bad dessert at all if they change the plate.Service wise it was a mixed bag. The 'waiter' who brought us the menu didn't come back to take our order and when he did he didn't seem very happy in the sense he never smiled and his body language was not positive. Perhaps he'd had a bad or long day. One positive thing I will say is that he brought us two glasses of iced water without us asking for it. Kudos for that. He also did smile and looked much happier after we told him the dessert was nice. Later when we wanted to ask for the bill there was no-one in sight so I had to go outside to tell the barman we wanted to pay. He duly brought us the bill with a smile and a bounce. He seemed very chirpy. As I said earlier, we were the only ones inside. Outside had a number of tables and so I guess they tend to focus resources on that area. I won't fault them for that but maybe occasionally they can look in on the inside. The toilet has music piped in from the restaurant. That was kinda nifty. But the flush is very weak. God forbid someone needs a number 2 there

I visited this afternoon with my work colleague. The service was v slow. It took them more than 10 min to serve us even though there was hardly anyone around.
5
What a fun place this was. My family was really happy with the food and the atmosphere. Come on a weekend and enjoy the jazz they play sometimes. Thanks, Ricciotti!
4
While eating on the terrace you can enjoy a great view to the river. We had bruchetta with tomatoes to start. For main dish pasta alle vongole and pasta granchio. You can choose the type of pasta you want, all home made. Both dishes were very tasty. For desert a delicious tiramisu and home made ice cream. Good espresso to finish the meal. With two glasses of white wine we paid 130 dollars. The service was first friendly and fast, but later we had to try hard to get the attention of the staff. Anyway it was a nice meal
3
I dropped into the new fit out which looked ab fab - on the river all was good. Serviced popped up quickly - all good. Wine list arrived only 2 whites by the glass but a lot more reds kinda odd balance. This is an Italian place so I shot for the interesting Sicilian white only to be told its not available! Its a standard Singapore restaurant annoyance. Why bother going to the effort printing the win list??? Get an ipad for goodness sake or a while board its not that hard. :-
4
Stopped here for dinner as we were craving pizza and this restaurant is rarely highly for its pie. We ordered the pizza platter ($48) and two glasses of Italian wine ($24). Th pizza toppings were great, especially the spinach and feta. The others we had were the Carnavore and the one with bacon and egg. The crust was a bit thinner than I usually enjoy, but overall, it was a good meal
4
We went to the Riverwalk one on a date night dinner. We just chanced upon the place and didn't really know what to expect. We were trying to choose between Chilis' just down the road and Ricciotti. We chose to eat here because we were in the mood to try something new and since Chilis' is our favourite, we've been there several times. Let me just start by saying that I have no regrets not choosing my favourite restaurant! It was a really hot night but when we stepped into the restaurant it was really nice and cool although it has an open plan layout. The ambiance is really soothing and you can still enjoy the live music and vocals that were being performed at the outdoor seating area. We ordered the platter of cold cuts and the homemade meat balls. The meat balls were so fresh and juicy and the sauce tasted fantastic! The food was well seasoned and the flavours were bigger and bolder. For the main course, we had the pasta with prawns and a 9" pizza. Again you could taste the freshness of the dough, the prawns were succulent and the pasta al dente. We were already feeling rather full so we split the dessert, which was the molten lava chocolate cake with gelato. It was delicious! I could not fault the restaurant on food quality, taste or service, which was prompt and attentive without being intrusive. They have a very decent selection of wines as well! I had the house pour white and it was really good
2
Looking for a good place to enjoy a good dinner with my love one. Found this restaurant on tripadvisor and read the reviews and everything looks great. So we called and booked a table for two. The first 5 mins of the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service are amazing and the menu looks really tempting but the foods we ordered are really disappointing. The chicken thigh steak, Fritto Misto, Soffiato are not worth for the place, but I have to say the signature Linguini is good and different which is the only dish that makes me a bit happier about the place. It's not worth 100$ dinner. I've been to restaurant with better views and food with a bit cheaper price. I would not come here again for sure
5
Went with my family for Sunday Brunch and we were all very contented with the food served, it was a delightful meal with good portions and great value. In addition, the live band created a nice atmosphere and added entertainment while we dine. Staff were polite and service provided was very cordial. Will definitely be back to try out their a la carte men
5
The food was great, the prices was absolutely fair, and the service was in top. This is my 3rd time visit and got better services, foods taste and decoration. It was all excellent
4
Had a lunch meal recently with a group of friends and I have to say, the food here is unforgettable - in a good way. The ingredients were fresh, the portion was just right and the service crew was so helpful.We ordered quite a lot as it was a big group - & we managed to try a huge variety. Antipasti, pizza, pasta, DESSERTS. You name it! We've tried it all. What I loved the most was Linguine Al Granchio and the Canella sweet pizza. The pizza crust was made on the spot and it was perfect! Almost like heaven on earth
5
Interesting decor and food was delicious - I had a beautiful main course Pollo Alla Milanese - just as described on menu served hot on time and generous portions! Try the Soffiato, reasonable price . It almost seems like you cannot go wrong with a meal here. Service was efficient as well. Will definitely be back soon to try other recommended food..
5
My family went to Ricciotti - Riverwalk outlet on Sunday for Lunch and we really enjoyed very much. The first impression was to see the River view and listening to the Jazz music band was unforgettable. The staffs were very attentive and they can recommend Ricciotti’s signatures dishes. We did not have to wait very long for the food and both of us and kids are really enjoyed the food and service. We have ordered three dishes recommended by the service staff. Their portion are very generous and just nice for us.1. Linguine AI Granchio (Ricciotti - Signature Dish) Signature pasta with crab meat. Very rich crab meat and every spoon is tasteful. 2. Grilled Boneless Chicken Chicken is very tender and good mishmash with Italian salad and sauce. 3. Penne Carbonara Children favorite dish. Creamy, cheesy and my kids love it.4. Desserts - Tiramisu  Texture is just nice between soft and firm. Coffee aroma is also noticeable and added to enjoy the taste.   - Soffiato Rich Chocolate cake with Ice-cream. Dark chocolate taste and sweet Ice-cream bring good combination of sweet and bitter together. My son loves it very much and even thumb up. We also can enjoy Live music during our lunch. There is music band at certain timing. So please do not miss this chance.After taking coffee & Latte, we really enjoyed our lunch out at Riccotti-Riverwalk.We will definitely come back again and recommend to our friends
5
This is one of the best italian casual dining resturant in Singapore. Been to many, but did not have a good experience. In Ricciotti, there was alot of varieties in the menu. Have been frequently visiting as their Arriabiata have become an addiction. The ambience of the place is nice and cosy, and their staffs are very friendly. Looking forward into trying more on their menu, worth the price as their portion is very generous
4
Lunch at Ricciotti was definitely an enjoyable experience. Ordered Fritto Misto, Cod Fillet and Soffiato. Fritto Misto is a good choice if you want variety. Cod Fillet was very fresh and delicious. Soffiato is my all time favourite! Overall, service was excellent and food was delectable
3
went there in february..loving the asparagus salad...not so keen on the spinach gnocchi, its too chewy, should be softer and melt in your mouth. but the sauce is good.Had brownie for dessert, was ok..Overall great... price was worthed
5
Decided to have some beers here whilst waiting fir my wife.Very pleasant 2 hours or so.It was late afternoon and there were plenty of diners on the walkway.I took a comfortable seat insude.1 plnt of ice cold Beroni was SGD12, not bad for Singapore.Had a chat to the Italian manager who was very hands on with the customers, 25 year old guy who is ambitious and will go places.Staff excellent.Food looked delicious.Couple of guys to entertain as well . unlikely combo.....guitar and trombone, but worked well.Great spot
4
Good, clean easy to get to from Clarke Quay MRT. Pizza, dessert, coffee and a beer for two people was S$100. Went here in March last year and would go again,
4
The reason for my rating is this:I give the food a 3.5 rating. Pretty average fare. However, the service was exceptional. I would give the service here a 5 rating, period. They really set themselves apart from other establishments in the city. The location is great, next to the river, perfect place to take in the city and the people
5
Head over to Ricciotti @ Riverwalk for a meal yesterday with the office colleagues. Offers a wide range of variety, all look and taste good! Spoil for choice. Overall a great place to hang out and chill with groups of friends over some good food & beer.My absolute favorite dessert has to be the Canella Sweet Pizza! such a simple, uncomplicated yet unique combination. Highly recommended
3
I have eaten at Ricciotti over the pass 10 years. When it first started, I loved the Paninis and Pizzas that they served and also the whole cakes which were delicious. I ordered those frequently for my friends birthday and everybody loved it. By the end of the 1st year I had tried almost every item on its menu.When the 1st revamp came about, the whole cakes disappeared. Lucky the Paninis, Pizzas and signature mains remained still just as good.. After the second revamp, alot of the staff changed and well the service standard dropped abit. But the food standard remained.Today I just went there for dinner after having last visited almost 6 months ago. I was shocked by the food that was served. The seafood pizza now seems to be made on an economical model. I could not tell the different seafood apart base on a quick glance. The pizza dough was not as crispy; now its abit chewy and the wait staff said that I could request for more crispy dough.The portion for the pasta that was served was rather small and it came out rather cold. I was too shocked by the hot food to even try their signature desserts which I am fond of
4
Italian food was good. Think, must taste Italian food in Italy:-) But if you want get a piece of Italian taste, you can visit this place.
3
We were in the mood for pizza after touring the city all day and passed this spot along the water. Sat outside and watched the world go by. Service was good...we weren't rushed and the pizza....while not the best I've ever had...is good value.
5
I had salmon and it was beautiful. The food was excellent as was the service. The location is on the river

The Singapore Riverwalk has a recently renovated new addition which you will not want to miss; Ricciotti on The Riverwalk.The fresh and colorful decor includes and indoor/outdoor terrace and bar at the riverside with spacious seating where unique cocktails, wines and beers are served. I recommend the Twisted Negroni which has a set of savory ingredients found only at Ricciotti on The Riverwalk in Singapore. The indoor/outdoor bar and terrace is smartly equipped with rain awnings which enabled us to enjoy a cocktail amidst the downpour of a Singapore December rainstorm, without being inconvenienced by the sudden thunder and rainstorm, which was truly a refreshing experience. The menu is a refreshing selection of pastas, pizzas, salads and main dishes each with their own unique flavor and presentation which will delight your senses of sight, smell, and the desire for savory. I recommend one of the pastry selections which are fresh, unique and delectable. The wait staff are exceptionally pleasant, helpful and positive which is a refreshing experience when entertaining business guests or clients.Surprise someone important or special in your life or business and treat them to an evening of savory surprises in an atmosphere which looks and feels like a unique dining space in your own home

Ricciotti reopened after renovations in September. I had lunch in late October when the menu was still under design and dinner some 2 weeks later. The quality of the food we had was wonderful - the fritto misto was made with fresh fish/seafood and fried in a light batter; the salmon rucola and mandarin salad was a delight. On a recent visit it would seem that the accountants have looked at two months of data and tarted rationing supplies. The fritto misto was a poor cousin of what was made 6 weeks earlier, seemingly battered with breadcrumbs and tasting more like pre-prepared product than freshly made. Also, I don't understand why the large pizza can't be made such that slices can be held with one hand without collapsing halfway along. The service has improved from being bad to now only average with most of the waiting staff seemingly familiar with the menu and semi-attentive. Overall, the value concept is moderate given the cost
4
There is no doubt that Ricciotti has the dishes to attract foodies in Singapore. With a wide range of offering on its menu, there would be that one Italian dish for everyone. I personally prefer their pizzas here - the doughy yet crispy crust when served. The reminiscent of the homemade seafood stew made by belly happy.More my full review: http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/11/ricciotti-pizzapastagrill-riverwalk.htm

We only have 24 hours in Singapore so after a stroll around the Quay area near our hotel we came across this recently refurbished Italian restaurant.To get me across the threshold initially It's all about the look of a place (bit shallow possibly?) but I figure if they're interested enough in the decor the food should follow and, once again, my 'theory' paid off.Lots of limed oak tables with vintage cutlery picked up at a flea market in Nice, the restaurant has a lovely riverside setting with air-conditioning indoors and the waiters couldn't have been more welcoming and attentive throughout the meal without being intrusive.The menu is fairly typical Italian fayre but the quality of the food wasn't 'tired' as a lot of Italan restaurants can be; the herb focaccia was freshly made, the fish was perfectly cooked with a zingy tomato concasse and the panacotta had vanilla seeds dotted throughout and exactly the right amount of 'wobble'.You got the impression that everyone was trying their best to make sure you had a great dining experience - we did
4
I have visited this restaurant several times but they have never disappointed me overall. The quality of foods, especially cheese-based dishes are must try in Singapore. In particular, I love an appetizer dish with mozzarella cheese with slice of tomatoes...soooo nice! Also, pizzas are crispy and I have always been satisfied with any choice of toppings so far. The pizza with Gorgonzola cheese pleasantry kills me always! Their desserts are also good and latte or cappuccino are served in much nicer fashion than Starbaxx. The only drawback of this restaurant is a bit of disappointing attitude of the staff in the hall. Some of them are quite young and they might not be trained well to care about customers. I wish to give full 5 stars with this improvement near future!
5
My daughter picked the restaurant on a whim as we vaguely remembered a pleasant dining experience at their Riverside outlet. We were pleasantly surprised in more ways than one. The wine on promotion was not only good it was reasonably priced. The waiter/sommalier was knowledgeable and even offered us a free tasting promising to exchange the bottle if we didn't like it. That certainly put us in a good mood for the rest of the meal. The calzone, pasta with pesto sauce, prawn pasta, grilled calamari and grilled pork ribs were all good much better than we remembered. But the best surprise of all came at the end when my daughter was presented with a birthday cupcake and a scoop of ice cream. How did they know? No one told them. Mark gave a cheeky smile -- we make it our business to know! He must have noticed my daughter receiving a gift from her sister. Yes he smiled... the words HappY Birthday was emblazoned on her gift. What attentive service! We were very satisfied customers indeed. Great tasting food, alert , friendly and attentive service and overall a memorable dining experience. Thank you.
5
On a recent visit to Singapore, I only had one evening in the Clark Quay area and used Trip Advisor to find this gem. While most of the reviews were good, there were a few negative reviews. The tie breaker to me was that the Management team provided responses to many of the reviews, both positive and negative, and I felt it was worth a try. I sat outside looking over the River and enjoyed watching the boats and people go by. Anthony my waiter provided great service helping me decide on my Caprese Salad and Linguini Al Granchio. It was fabulous. I appreciated Anthony's service and the conversation he provided given that I was travelling alone. I will go back on my next trip
4
This is a restaurant along the riverside, at Clarke Quay. Being a vegetarian our food options were limited, however as my family loves Italian food we decided to try out this joint. For Entrees we ordered some of the options mentioned (cant remember now), the size and portion was huge and not to mention it was very tasty. I ordered for some Champagne, which was a good thing to start with :)For the main course we had some pasta and a vegetarian pizza with asparagus and some other toppings, and egg. Now the egg actually messed up the pizza which was otherwise very yummy.For dessert also there was a very nice strawberry cake and some chocolate mouse or something like that. Over all the service, choice of food, location of the restaurant everything was extremely good. We simply loved this place and would highly recommend it to people who like Italian food
4
One of my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. I recommend the pizza, the espresso. Only point to improve: the service is not good, not so friendly, not so professional. But still acceptable.
3
This Italian restaurant is situated alongside the Singapore river. The outlook is nice & service was friendly and attentive.We had meatballs with tagliatelle and spaghetti marinara for mains.We both finished off with chocolate & pistachio ice cream. The food was reasonable-nothing to set the world on fire but OK.A good place for Europeans to eat if they are a little afraid of spicy cuisine
4
After craving some carbs all day we decided to make a trip to Ricciotti. Food: Caprese - tomato & mozarella- very fresh and good size portion.Pizza half rustica & asparagi - yummy toppings of olives, artichoke,egg, asparagus. Tasty & crispy crust.Service: Very attentive service. Waiters are smiling and watch out for our water glass levels.Nice and relaxed atmosphere. Good for a date.Would come back here again
1
11:00 am....for 25 minutes and no one approached for the order.scandalous .looked at me and no one greeted me asked .There were only 5 customers.I had lunch somewhere els
5
I ALWAYS go to this restaurant every time I am in Singapore! I am huge lover of Carbonara and Ricciotti's is 10/10! My family all rave about the restaurant every time we go. The food is always outstanding and I would definitely recommend either of the Riverwalk restaurant or China Square outlets. I would definitely make a trip here if you have not already! Although the food is more on the pricey side, it is definitely worth it! My Italian restaurant of choice!
5
It was my anniversary with my bf when we had our dinner here..we decided to have our celebration in this restaurant due to outstanding feedback we heard from our friends. we have the unforgettable experience start from the food,ambience and most importantly a "personal touch" service provided by the staff and Mr. Max. it was a night to remember… it's a good feeling that aside from the value for money,,they were able to meet and exceeds our expectation. thank you so much! and we will definitely comeback again and again!..:
5
We walked past the crowds at the seafood restaurant to find this gem of a place a few paces on. Seated inside, we had a very tasty glass of wine with our flavour-packed generous servings of dinner. Costly? Not to our minds. I was a bit hesitant about the tiramisu until assured that it was made to the Italian recipe. And it was. Delicious from start to finish. Would I recommend to friends? Most certainly. Will I be back? Absolutely - the very next time we're in Singapore. Mille Gracie for the great food
5
Staff provided excellent service and the food was wonderful. Ordered Pizza Bread with red onion and safe just gorgeous. Three pasta dishes which were flavoursome and pasta was aldente. Carnivorous pizza was crisp with plenty of meat. Would certainly return.
5
Just next to the Disney World crowd of Jumbo Seafood, here it is the Italian oasis of Ricciotti. Whether river view outside sitting for people watching or cosy bustle-free inside sitting for intimate conversations with your good friends, I've found the place very accommodating all your purposes. My favorite tiramisu also didn't disappoint me with its dangerously addictive bitter & sweet combination. Thank God I had a great company so that my mouth could get busy talking too. Otherwise...the restaurant kitchen might have got super busy topping up their cake display. I'll definitely go back to the place for their great food, drinks and ambience
2
Seriously dissapointed nearly spat my beer out at the price and would have had the beer not been so damn expensive! Surely a meat pizza including 4 different meats has the each meat across the whole pizza? Not here it was like eating 4 samples. For the money I would expect so much more. They could even do a half and half pizza for the kids to share. Our kitchen can't do that, yet the can split a pizza in to 4 samples! Go figure! Waiter was new and nice enough but clearly needs some confidence. Just dissapointed
4
Just had a Saturday business lunch at the Ricciotti pizza pasta grill in China Square.My colleague and I tried two different pizzas and have to say both were extremely nice.Why oh why the staff swept the floor around us, then mopped the floor beggars belief. Apart from it not being hygenic, you would surely think they could wait until we leave (or sweep elsewhere) especially as we were the only diners. This lost them the full 5-stars
1
Attempted to eat their lunch special "grilled chicken for 13.00 10,00+10% service and 7% tax" and it was 1/2 the size of my friend plate. Dry as it was pounded so thin. And potatoes were as cold as the salad. When I asked to send it back the staff, who said he was the manager, said it was promotion and handed it back. Avoid this place. Horrible.
4
Great location & good value for money, especially the signature 1.5kg spicy chicken dish which is more than enough for two people & at only S$32.50 is top value. Only downside is a very limited beer selection
5
Located on the Riverwalk, the view is lovely, but the air conditioning inside was even more tempting. After an exhausting morning in Chinatown in the heat, a cool beer and a delcious pizza really hit the spot. The staff was attentive, friendly, and so accomodating. My pizza (The Rustica) was delicious with a thin perfectly done crust, goat cheese, grilled zucchini, black olives, and sun dried tomatoes. The 9 inch size was great for one and the beer was cold. If you are a bit tired of Asian dishes and want to try something Italian, this is the spot. Oh, and the gelato for dessert was fab
4
It was a belated birthday celebration for father in law. Bunch of 6A+3C. Reservation was made online but on arrival, there was no record of our name. Thankfully the service staff quickly sprung into action and arranged a table indoor to accommodate all of our gang. We were glad to be seated within a few minutes . A+ for their efforts in service recovery. The ambience of the restaurant goes along the casual dining route, and is family / kids friendly. However it can get a little noisy. Among us, we ordered 2 salads, 3 pasta dishes and 3 grilled dishes as well as a 12" pizza to share. Food was generally good, pasta was al dente and my steak was grilled to perfection at medium well doneness. They have a promotion on wines on weekends - Chile red wine at $19 a bottle which we could not resist. There is also outdoor seating which gives a view of the Singapore river as you dine along. We finished the meal with some desserts ( cheesecake, carrot cake.) and coffee.Service was generally prompt and friendly. Worth returning in future again
4
I stopped for coffee-cake special when passing which was excellent, so went back next day for coffee & later same evening for lovely meal, chicken, salad & mash with glass italian wine & focaccia Good ambience, very attentive and hospitable staff as well, which makes a big difference. We took advantage of the two for one wine offer and accompanied with a good Italian red. Overall it was very reasonable price evening meal, mot cheap but it was good food and generous servings, worth it. Would definitely go again and is recommended even just stop for coffee, as great view of river & has alfresco & indoor air-conditioned dining options. Much better value & location than heart of Clarke Quay only a short bridge crossing away. Very nearby is MRT & largeshopping mall.
4
i would actually rate this somewhere between good and average but as I can't and there wasn't anything bad about it I have gone with very good. We came here for a quick lunch after visiting the EPSC just above it and it was the kind of thing we were looking for. Their menu was varied and we went for a couple of Panini's. I had the steak, onions and cheese, he had their signature parma ham and mozzarella. We both enjoyed them and they were a nice size for lunch - not too filling so you feel sleepy at your desk all afternoon. The staff were also very friendly and efficient. I'd definitely go back to see what the fuller meals are like
5
Had dinner last two nights. Pizza one night and chicken/pork ribs the next. Well executed food at reasonable prices for Singapore. Wine list ranges from cheap up - good quality. The service is efficient with a smile. Will make this a regular outing. Name is actually Ricciotti if you are googling
5
We had stopped for coffee when passing which was excellent, in the past so we decided to celebrate Chinese New Years Eve last night and have a meal there. Good ambience, music good and not too loud, very attentive and hospitable staff as well, which makes a big difference. We chose an Aglio as a starter, followed by Spaghetti Marinara, which was excellent (could do with a tad of chilli to bring it to life though) and a good coffee and cheesecake for dessert. We took advantage of the two for one wine offer and accompanied with a good Italian red. Overall it was not cheap but it was good and worth it. We would definitely go again and this outlet is recommended
3
Unpretentious restaurant with quite good cuisine. Tried Pizza, proper Italian crust, and a good selection of nice desserts.
5
I work in Singapore since over a year, only recently I discovered Ricciotti which is a nice surprise. Lovely place, friendly staff, super-delicious italian food, grab a glass of wine and spend here all day!
4
Weeknight dining meant the place was slightly quieter and that was great. Service staff was attentive and friendly. The pasta, with vegetarian option, was hearty and just enough; even though this is a small chain restaurant. Not an extensive wine list, but good enough. The table was outdoor by the river was great - solo or couple
4
I've eaten here twice in the last four months and frankly, I find it a pleasant way to end an evening with more than adequate italian food at a reasonable price.While on the riverwalk, it is not in the middle of the hucksters on the Boat quay and has an outdoors that is relatively scenic and quiet. There is an indooors area too that looks comfortab le, but who wants that?I found the food more than adquate, having a salad caprese on both occasions, once a pasta (carbonara?) and the second time a pizza. Each time I had a bottle of wine with them that was very modestliy priced. I think the last time I was there I got away for $80 SGD for a pizza, caprese salad, bottle of wine and a Pelegrino. Both meals were just what I was looking for, without being too pretentious.I think it is kind of a hidden jem on the quays

A late evening supper turned into a late evening nutter of a night. Coffee and a cheese platter was all the three of us wanted. Well we got the coffee and we got the cheese but hang on, where's the crackers or bread to eat them with?"No sir you need to pay extra for the bread" was the answer to my query. Gobsmacked I was! Just how does one eat creamy goats cheese and gorgonzola without something to spread them on. The manager came and agreed that it was probably a good idea but it was Chef Gero's policy to serve the cheese without the usual (well, standard practice to all the rest of the civilized world) bread or crackers.So we paid up for the bread - very reluctantly as the staff will attest to.Hang on there's more!Sitting outside in the tropical heat we were comforted by the overhead fans.Not for long! The restaurant closes at 11 but the fans stop work much earlier. Central control was the staff answer to another query. Come on guys if you have a policy of keeping your restaurant open till 11 then would it not be a good idea to keep the fans and air conditioners going for longer than 1040 or so? We were not the only customers still there but I bet we all got the hint to finish quickly so the staff could nick off home.I know they were in a hurry to get out of the place because one if the staff chose to prepare the bill and present it to us mid-mouthful! Now that's friendly service not. Efficient for them but not for us.Not the finest moment in this restaurant's existence and which forms part of the fine dining Garibaldi brand.The evening was saved a smidgen by the manager instructing our smirking waiter to leave the room and apologizing for the early bill. The rest she said she could not because of the "management policies". It's the usual cop out but a way too convenient one.So my advice to anyone who wants a late cheese scoffing - bring your own crackers, carry a personal fan and prepare your cash at the same time you are greeted by the weary waiters

What a pity, a decent restaurant going bad ! Its the closest Italian restaurant to where I work and over the years I have eaten here over a hundred times. I am writing this only after I the last three times when the Pasta was consistently bad, or at least the sauces were faulty.The Arrabiata extremely oily and salty and the tomato base seemed blended like something out of a can. The Bolognese salty and oily but otherwise tasteless. Sometimes the pasta was way overdone. Even the cheese and chilli flakes can be clumpy and of poor quality.I am hoping of course that this is a hiccup in its operations and therefore temporary but less see.......Meanwhile if you are intending to eat here, choose the Pizza

Not a lot to say about this restaurant. Nothing just sticks in my memory. Food was good. Great outdoor seating for people watching and less crowded. They do have specials throughout the week. I had the lasagna which was okay. It wasn't a restaurant that I wanted to return to for the second time while visiting Singapore. very limited menu. Service was good. Our waiter was new and didn't know some of the answers to our questions about the menu but he found someone that knew the answers. So, I give this a thumbs up!Overall, I would say that there are better choices in Singapore because of the variety of food that they have. If you just have to have Italian food; it's a okay choice

I've eaten here twice so far. Once in June and just a few days ago. Both times we came for late lunch. The weather was nice and there was some breeze. We sat outside and ordered a pizza and pasta. My pasta fusili with gorgonzola was excellent, al dente like I like it. The sauce was a bit overwhelming, I'd like it with more zucchini. My husband's pizza looked & tasted awesome, we asked for extra crispy and they did it nicely. They have different promos everyday, we missed the day when they had 50%off the 2nd pizza. Maybe next time..

If you're just looking for a panini, calzone or pasta with a good strong coffee and the minimum of fuss, this is a great place.It's in a small quiet stretch, and as an added bonus, you can sit outside and watch the boats ply the river

Definitely authentic, because it's my Italian husband's favourite place. We like the spaghetti alio olio with prawns. EXCELLENT desserts. not a place for an extravaganza meal though. it's just simple and delicious. It's hard to find a place in the business district that offer spacious seating. many other restaurants close by have quite cramped seating

Desserts are disappointing. Sandwiches are quite good though.

My partner and I recently had our dinner at the restaurant on a Sunday evening. Though the food was decent italian fare, we were very unhappy with the service. Towards the end of our meal, they couldn't wait to "chase us out" even though it was only about half past ten

Generally speaking it does serve a good selection of italian cuisine depending on whether you appreciate the taste. I like their pastas and even the pizzas. Non-greasy and not as cheesy as your average pizza hut. Dishes can be quite plain but the desserts are beautiful. Other than food, ambience is a bit cold and the service is is ok. For the price you pay, it will make sense to go somewhere else

Good paninis, bad ambience

The pastas and salads are very nice. Great for a weekend brunch.

Great pizzas and great value. Just order a bottle of wine between 2, and the margherita pizza is free..just add your own toppings. After 9pm, desserts are 1/2 price.

excellent pastas, salads and sinful desserts. friendly prices and casual setting. location by the river makes the alfresco a great chill out place.

I liked the rucola salad and the shrimp salad.. It was done very well, tangy dressing for the rucola salad and the shrimps were aptly undercooked so the translucence displayed the freshness.. The parma pizza was nothing to shout about as they could have been more generous with the ham and not lay it so thin that it was difficult to distribute evenly to the slice.. There was also a good peach float in the menu which was very refreshing but not enough to even start quenching thirst. My only complaint with this place is the weird menu arrangement and the non-English speaking staff.. They spoke English but it was totally incomprehensible due to their thick Indian imported accent. This has got nothing to do with the food though, so all I did was to avoid talking to anybody or asking for any suggested help. It is a safe and casual place to go
