European cuisine. Had my anniversary celebration last saturday. The appetisers and main course are delicious, but the desserts is extremely disappointing. Paid $14 for the frozen souffle, but we only tasted cream.
4
A nice place to hangout for coffee. Pasta was decent. Iberico Pork was awesome. However the pancakes and truffle fries were terrible.
3
quality of food good service very attentive atmosphere discreet not too noisy. altogether worth visiting more often
3
Not much customers if you go there early at 11am, brunch variety is good, and the service staff have nice attitudes. However, if you are sitting in the pods, it may be slightly challenging to get the attention of the waiters.
5
Service and food was great. Unique experience of good European food, with inexpensive menu. Good variety of wine choices as well.
4
It's our first time visiting the restaurant. Ambience was great. Lunch set was so-so but we like the ravioli a lot!

I decided on Porta after searching on the Internet for various places to dine on Valentine's Day. The main draw for me honestly was the value of the dinner. The food was very good for its value. Service was also attentive and they constantly checked with us on how everything was. All in all, a great experience

We booked the restaurant when booking Park Hotel Clarke Quay months ago without twigging our ladt night wAS Valentines Day.Upon arriving at hotel realised there was a 6 course menu with two items I avoid eating.Spoke to a very unhelpful waiter who said I had to have set menu.Later I mentioned I would have to cancel to Angelina in the Crystal Club and she sorted things with the chef and I was given alternatives.So far as good.Arriving at 8.00 pm for meal was told the table had been booked for 6.30 and they would try and fit us in which was literally what happened. A table was added a d we were so near the adjacent tables we might of been on the same table. We had booked to eat outside. While waiting to be served I retrieved my booking confirmation clearly showing an outside 8 pm booking.My husband received his started (an oyster) which sat they for 20 minutes while awaiting my starter. A waiter tried to give us our 3rd course and eventually .y husband had 3 courses on table at same time and I only had potential of the soup. The manager came over and removed everything, apologised and offer complementary drink.Things then improved and the food was lovely but by now we were far from relaxed.We were not alone in having service problem as the couple on the next table were not served their 2nd course and their bottle of wine wasn't brought to them until after they had finished their main course. The live in Singapore and say they will never return.Next issue. Ask for the bill and charged for complimentary drink. We I said this to the cashier she snatched the bill from me very abruptly. On presentation of second bill I mentioned they was no discount as stated in the details in our room. Was told it was a special night so no discount. It would have been nice to be told. The manager said to come back the next day and he would try to make up to us.When we related our experiences to the lady in the Crystal Room she was horrified and immediately contacted her hotel manager. He also wasn't impressed and honoured the discount. Also offer another symbol of apologise which again we were unable to accept as leaving within 6 hours.Really spoilt our last evening after what had been a lovely hotel

Primarily catering to the hotel guests, hence the menu may not be very extensive. But it tries to offer something different from most hotel restaurants which serve upmarket versions of local dishes. A nice quiet place to while away an afternoon far from the madding crowd
5
lovely restaurant. no wonder its been awarded. i need to come back again tho because i didn't get to enjoy my food due to an emotional meeting with a former lover. why we didn't speak after enjoying the food i have no idea! i would've loved to actually eat the food.... it looked so good
4
Booked the place to celebrate my gf birthday, the ambiance is alright but more importantly, the food is above expectation and service is attentive as well.
4
only value for money if it has 1 for 1 promotion, hope the 1 for 1 promotion will continue. if not, pricing wise is bit too high. Atmosphere is actually quite noisy as the in door sitting area too clamp.
4
Nice place to opt for when having gathering. Set lunch is at a very good pricing. Serving of food is a bit slow and therefore needs patience for food to be served. Worth going!
4
Decent christmas feast, good steak and log cake. But lobster bisque was a bit too strong/bitter for me
4
Service was great. Staff were friendly and made suggestions of food to order. We ordered the Spanish squid which was great.
4
Food is nice and affordable for a italian restaurant. Location near to fort canning mrt station, very convenient.

We decided to celebrate Christmas with my team yesterday night in Porta.The place is quite nice and convenient to chill out and chat. Not a fine dining place but more casual.The service was just ok, but I’m seen much worse in Singapore, so nothing to complain about.Food wise, the appetizers were very good and nicely dressed, main courses were ok but not memorable, flavors were a bit flat, the cooking not very well controlled, and finally desserts disappointing.We ordered:Appetizers: pan-seared foie gras / char-grilled octopus / Burrata with tomatoes and pestoMains: salmon / carbonara pasta / pasta with prawns and chorizo / haddock fish with fenel / steak-fries / ravioles with tomato sauceDesserts: tiramisu / frozen soufflé with Grand Marnie

The restaurant is rather poorly spaced out. Yes it is pretty with quaint furnishing and furniture. But one can’t help but shiver as the air conditioning draft blew down directly at us from above our seats. Things seem rather disheveled as well with the service. Perhaps we arrived too early? We were given one menu to share amongst five of us, and the server seemed to be the only one on the floor so being sat at the back of the restaurant, we completely went unseen unless she came around. The starters were great. We loved the home smoked salmon and octopus. The mains were average. My friends said their pastas were average and the communication seemed to have been lost where we requested for no bacon chips in one of them but the chips appeared anyway. The haddok was quite boring in taste and look. Covering your fillets with the vegetables like canteen food doesn’t make it appetising. The beef seemed to be the best as my friends enjoyed theirs. The desserts... I’d say skip the baked Alaska or risk being disappointed. The rest are average.For the prices, it would be nice if the staff had knowledge of what they were serving and what is on the menu. For example, when I wasted to order the dessert, it seemed I had better knowledge of what’s on the dessert menu than the server. This place has much to improve. And has so much potential for that.

Made a dinner reservation at Porta to celebrate an anniversary/birthday. Had requested one of their private booths. Even though they called to inform that those were generally reserved for larger groups of 4-6 pax, I was delighted to find that they had accommodated my request and reserved a booth for us, when we turned up on that day. Food was top-notch and wine recommendations were good. Service was attentive and excellent. Would definitely recommend
5
booked porta for my anniversary with my fiancee and had norwegian salmon and iberian pork secreto both cooked to medium rare. pork was extremely chewy with superb sauce and salmon was tender and simply melt in the mouth, coupled with good service, it is a place worth going again :
4
Food quality pretty decent. Octopus, prawn chorizo pasta and pork secreto were awesome. Decently priced
5
What I enjoyed is their Iberico pork secreto, prawn and chorizo pasta (a bit spicy), Spanish octopus. Their coconut blancmange is nice.
4
Pleasant and casual lunch experience. Hotel food standard and nice. Salmon medium perfectly done and wine chicken up to standard. Suggestion set menu to change from time to time will be great. Thanks
3
The dishes were mostly nice, (juicy pork, fresh pan fried fois gras) but the options for Gluten free guest were very limited (they were notified in advance).
Also the fish in Fenel was a bit dry.
5
I had a nice 3-course dinner for 2 persons. The 1-for-1 drinks promotion was delightful. Parking was also convenient hassle-free.
4
A recommended place for business lunch with clients and old friends gathering, dinning in a nice & cool atmosphere and affordable price, my friends all like the place very much.
4
I ordered the squid ink pasta and chorizo pasta. Both were very tasty, portions were generous.
I used my uob card and was entitled to 1 for 1 on the main courses. Meal worked out to $23 for 2 pastas.
4
The food was overall pleasant and the overall ambience was terrific. The waiting staff was courteous and attentive as well. Highly recommend!
4
Great place to be for group dining! It's casual and relaxed, while hotel staff are attentive. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food items for their price points. Would definitely revisit them!
4
Well this was a lovely surprise. Great menu with a huge variety of options. The service was quick and prompt so we shared a variety of entrees and then had a main meal each. All were lovely and the service whilst attentive wasn't over the top. Wine and water delivered when requested
5
The ambience of rhe restaurant was excellent coupled along with the nice interior design of the place.
4
Visited Porta for birthday celebration. Ordered 2 Iberico Pork medium well main courses and one of them was overcooked. Service wise was impeccable. But could improve on consistency of food.
4
Porta is connected to Park Hotel Clarke Quay. It has good, clean food. It has a good morning buffet, although we ordered from the menu.
4
food was delicate and yummy service great. Three course dinner was park of package. Coconut desert yummy!
4
Happily satisfying set lunch with various choices and excellent main course preparation for the medium cooked salmon and grilled red wine chicken. Very nice thank you.
4
Their selection of food, both Italian and French, is quite good. Service is warm and very friendly. plesant.
5
Food was great and atmosphere was even better. Whole dining session was very cosy and quiet, perfect for celebration.
4
Porta offers a small menu but most of the main courses were well executed, in particular, the Haddick fillet and Iberian pork secreto. Wish the tables were further apart. Love the OCBC 1-for-1 mains promotion!
4
Main course was in fact very good. Drinks were okay too. Dessert is a huge disappointment, we ordered frozen souffle but it was just ice cream! Staff could have warned us that it was just ice cream and not some souffle it was supposedly called!Ambience is nice but seats are a bit close for comfort. I can see and hear the next tables.The male waiter (chinese guy) was very attentive, but the taller asian lady is not, she did not even give me a menu after I was shown to the table
3
Porta has strong potential to be a really nice restaurant with it's location and strong base of good food. However, the extremely poor service and lack of effort to make the atmosphere more appealing (it feels a bit like a cafeteria) will prevent us from returning
5
Excellent service and food! Service was prompt and top-notched. Not to mention that service staffs were extremely polite.
3
average variety with some of the food a little stale. layout is a little confused for breakfast meal - but overall not bad
4
Good food, reasonable price - waiting time a little too long, otherwise worth the stop, with special discounts for people staying at the hotel (Park Hotel Clarke Quay)
4
Food was good (no complains for all dishes ordered) but not much variety. Service was good too. Will definitely be back.
4
Food are great and so does the service. Location are good too. Price are very reasonable. set lunch are very worth ordering.
3
This is a nice restaurant. A bit crowded but there are booths which are quiet. Food choices are good western food. Prices are reasonable with one for one drinks. Bread was inedible.
4
Value for money because UOB having credit card promotion: 1-for-1 &/ 30% for food item.The restaurant is fully booked, maybe due to the promotion too.Anyway, the choices of food is limited, the presentation of the food is so so, but the important is the food taste delicious.Starter: Butternut - pumpkin soup (if add a little bit more salt will enhance the taste of the pumpkin), Foie Gras (generous portion), Burratina (refreshing), Spanish Octopus (doneness is just right), Cold Cuts Platter (I would not recommend, nothing fantastic) and Salmon Trout (ice-burg lettuce salad with honey mustard, recommend to share)Main Course: Porta Burger (juicy, add $1.50 for a small tiny bottle of premium ketchup, I can taste the difference of the ketchup compare to common brand ketchup from the shelves), Angus Beef Rib-eye (nothing to shout about), Truffle Carbonara (taste is good but I would prefer the spaghetti to be more Al-dente), Ravioli De Royans - mini cheese ravioli (yummy!) and Iberico Pork Secreto (pork should is moist and tender)Dessert: Coconut Blancmange (something unusual and it is not too sweet), Valrhona Chocolate (warm chocolate lava cake, you wont stop at one spoon) and Frozen Souffle (first time eating it, normally it is serve warm - fluffy and it take 20-25 minutes to be serve, taste like ice-cream but I cant taste the grand Marnier)Service is above-average with casual friendly ambienc

I ordered the Burratina for appetiser and Haddock Fillet for Main and they are of good quality.Their price is reasonable and environment is quiet for weekend lunch. Best for birthday celebration and family gathering. The restaurant has sufficient seating and not noisy. The staff is polite and very pro

Thoughtfully composed & competently executed dishes unfortunately marred by very bad service. Waitresses and manager care more about their own comfort and convenience rather than try to create an enjoyable experience for the customer. Their "it's-just-a-job" attitude was made abundantly clear in every aspect of the dining experience.We were rushed to order, seated in the most crammed front of the restaurant and told that we could not pack our leftovers. Our starter arrived late into our mains, and only after we reminded them that we were missing a dish. The tables were so close together I was afraid I would catch the bug from the lady coughing next to me. The other quieter half of the restaurant remained completely empty for our entire meal, and when asked why we couldn't doggy-bag our food, we were curtly told "because we don't". Pricing of dishes could have easily afforded coverage of a plastic container for a doggy bag. Even if it isn't the policy, surely we could have been told in a nicer way ?Service staff very poorly trained and clueless about ambience and service. If this continues they should just stick to selling meat and condiments as a high-end supermarket, rather than charging full restaurant prices.We decided against having dessert because of the rude Indian manager, and given the very memorable experience they gave us we are not likely to ever come back
4
Service was great and together with a nice ambience (except for a noisy 2 girls who were laughing at the top of their voices despite stares from every other table). Food was good too with decent portion for the price. Location might be a little hard to spot though.
4
We had 4 nights at the Park Hotel in Clarke Quay, which meant 4 breakfasts. It was always busy, but the staff were efficient. The food was a good mixture of hot European and Chinese food, plus the usual toast and pastries, and cereals.
5
I had an enjoyable dinner on a friday night, the staffs even sang the bday song when presenting the cake to my friend. The pork and carbonara is good.
5
Was celebrate birthday at Porta. The surprise arrangement was nicely executed. Their service really good and being very polite.
5
The portions are comfortable for sharing, even the appetisers. My family of 11+1 had a great time. The food was well balanced and palatable even for adults. Will revisit! I'm really surprised the place was so quiet when we went. Perhaps it lacked the publicity.
5
Really amazed by the service of the staff - fast and efficient and friendly. Food wise, we had the Haddock Fish which was amazing and the burger!
3
Food is not bad, Service is warm and nice. Not sure I would come back there for Italian food as they are many good Italian restaurants (but also more expensive)
5
The ambience of this place was really nice! Went there on a Monday afternoon and there wasn't a crowd. Seriously fell in love with the food there. Their mushroom soup, prawn pasta and dessert was superb!!! And the service was really good, with friendly staffs! Would love to come back here in the near future :-)

Came here twice a week for business lunch. The range is not allot but good enough to choose from.However I feel the staff do not know how to describe the food very well. And they are not very attentive.Items taken includedSoup. Cucumber soup - Soup of the day. Was a little diluted and needed to add some salt to be more edible. And I dun eat too salty. Barley soup - Soup of the day. Was actually not bad though the staff didn't manage to describe the soup well. Pumpkin soup - Ala carte. This is of course very hearty and very comfortingAppetizers. Bread - Bread is always nice. Angel Hair - Nothing to brag about. Octopus - A little on the salty side and a little tough. Had better ones elsewhere before Main. Pork shoulder - All time favorite. Big portion. Came with mashed potato and some tomatoes. Prawn and Chirozo - This is a very surprising dish. Didn't expect it to be spicy. Overall, this dish is beautiful.. Ravioles - Something was just not right for this dish. Took a few bites and that was itDesserts. Chocolate tart with fruits - Tart was ok but alcohol infused fruits was too overwhelming. The fruits was probably supposed to go with the tart. Red velvet cake - Nice. Not too dr

We visited for lunch on a Saturday and had the foie gras and the octopus for starters. Both were pretty decent - the foie gras was slightly overcooked but portion was generous, but the octopus was grea! The steak we had was unevenly cooked though! It was well done on the side and medium rare in the middle even though we ordered it to be done medium , vegetables were very over cooked as well but the mash corn was a nice surprise. Staff were not very personable.

One thing to note about Porta-- most of the main dishes taste better than they look. Would return here again because service was with a smile, they have comfy & cosy booth tables, & also a complimentary parking voucher if you drive & parked in Park Hotel Clarke Quay (I had to ask for it, though- they didn't offer one to me straight up).Haddock Fillet ($26++)Good texture, but t'was a little salty in my opinion. As I am a hardcore meat eater. I probably wouldn't order this again. Porta Burger ($23++)Juicy & delicious patty; burger gets a little soggy towards the end, but it's something I can live with. The ketchup is quite something & if you want more it will cost you. Yum! Lastly but certainly not least: personal preference- wish the fries were skinny ones.Iberian Pork Secreto ($26++)Melt in your mouth pork slices. I am not a fan of pork, but this was really delicious. I would recommend it!Angus Beef Rib-Eye ($34++)Tastes MUCH better than it looks. I ordered mine medium-rare; on the outside it looks way overcooked, but it was quite perfect in every bite. Good flavour & texture.Valrhona Chocolate ($14++)Fabulous gooey centre; a decadent dessert meant to be shared, if not you'll feel like a buibui after you finish it all.Coconut Blancmange ($12++)The creamy coconut Panna Cotta was quite divine-- & the passionfruit on top gave it a good sour/tart kick. Indifferent towards the crumbles on top. Overall, pleasantly surprised with this dessert, though I would still prefer the Valrhona Chocolate (if shared) as a dessert. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats availableâ˜€ Alfresco seats available Accepts reservations - I used Chope Parking coupons available upon reques

We had good meals here and the staff were polite without being overbearing. I found the tables a little too close though for private conversations.
3
The atmosphere and the service were good. That's it. The food was average. The lobster bisque tasted strange. Very average stuff. Not sure whether the chef is an apprentice....
4
First time to this restaurant. Very good food. Recommend the ribeye steak and the Brazilian pork. The chocolate cake is a wonderful way to finish dinner. Service was attentive without being intrusive.
3
This is a cafe attached to the Park Hotel Clarke Quay and serves a buffet breakfast for hotel guests. It was OK but it is not a restaurant.
4
Went there for the set dinner and it's was great food for the price. Recommended dishes amongst all we've ordered: octopus for appetizer, pork for main, frozen soufflé for dessert.
1
Food is not up to standard. Not worth the price. There are only 4 tables of customer when I was there. Overheard the other table customer complains of the food quality hence the Chef came out to explain but Chef attitude was bad. The service for the waiter was alright.
3
Went there for brunch on Mother's Day. Service was impeccable, the staffs are attentive and patient. It was a semi-buffet - while the main course was ok, the buffet spread is really appalling compared to other semi-buffets I've been to. Desserts were ok but nothing to brag about. Oh there's a carpeted room for the kids to knock themselves out so that's good for family events
3
The portion sizes were substantial - one main each (and the lovely complimentary bread) was more than enough to fill us up. The Porta Burger was a delectable combination of beef, cheese and bacon and the Haddock was roasted to perfection, though not everyone was a fan of the capers in the dish (personal taste). Unfortunately, the Iberian Pork fell slightly short of expectation, turning out somewhat chewy instead of tender.On the whole, it was an enjoyable evening, with the coziness and privacy of our spot at one of the tables under the arches. The restaurant also kindly gave us a complimentary parking voucher for the hotel carpark, at our request.*A note to Chope users: Porta only accepts one Chope voucher per sitting, so use one $100 voucher instead of two $50 ones, for example

Brought a friend to Porta to celebrate her birthday with high expectations after reading some positive reviews. However, our experience was marred from the point we set foot to the restaurant. I had indicated that it was my friend's birthday lunch but the waiter flatly told me they were unable to do any Happy Birthday wording for our desserts and had no birthday tag as well. I had to suggest having a single candle on the dessert before they reluctantly agreed. Then they placed us at a table right in the middle and the narrowest part of the restaurant, where one patron actually hit the legs of my chair while walking past. I requested to change to the private booth seats at the corner, only to be refused because "those are only for 4-6 diners". All throughout our 1.5 hours there, none of the private booth seats were taken. When we wanted to place our set lunch orders, the waitress told us we had to wait till 12noon sharp. And so we ordered coffee to while the 25 minutes away. By now, I was getting annoyed and really hoped that the food would at least save the day but sadly, apart from the lovely warm breads, the appetisers didn't impress and the mains were both too salty. We decided to cut short our lunch and adjourned elsewhere for desserts. (So glad we did as we discovered FOC and their fabulous desserts! See my review for FOC)

I received 2 vouchers to dine at this restaurant. Call to enquire if I can use 2 vouchers at 1 go, the answer I got was YES. A week later I called again to make reservations and quote the vouchers number as required and was told I cannot use 2 vouchers. On the day of my dining, I was told can use. Would be good for the management and service staff to get this small issue right once and for all for other diners benefit.Food wise is good and service prompt
