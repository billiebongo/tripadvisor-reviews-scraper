Very convenient if you have business you are attending to in Wilkie Edge. The food is ok and relatively cheap. Good place to have a bite. I liked the hor fun.

The food was great and was surprised on how cheap it was. We have a great fried rice and Crispy noddles. The food arrived very quickly. Thank you .

My daughter favourite dish of sweet and sour fish. She even say that it's better than from her usual restaurant. Has a bit of wok hei. I'm definitely coming back to try their Hor fun.

We liked everything about this place except for the service. Really poor service provided by the staff. This may be because we were foreigners, I don't know. But the way staff reacted when we ask for something was terrible.

Good selection of baked confectionery and tarts. Nice corner to have afternoon tea/coffee with a pie/tart.
This is one of the halal-certified outlets for the Han's chain of cafes. And the best thing is, it's open 24h!

Service crew were friendly and served with a smile. Food was great and serving for meals was more than we expected. They are also open 24 hours.

Had breakfast at Hanis every morning during my week in Singapore. It is a fast restaurant. Order at the counter and they will ring your number after a few minutes. Food was clean and inexpensive. No fine dining but fast! They are open 24 hours, so it's a good place for a quick bite at any time. Very inexpensive set meal breakfast, like a cheese omlette with buttered toast and coffee

Roasted chicken Ala Carte $15.80 after 10pm. The set with soup and ice lemon tea was not available.Pricey roasted chicken and serving is only half a chicken. Taste was good. Sides on the plate, baby carrots were ok, whereas the fries were not as fresh. Ice water at 30 cents each and Yuan Yang at $2.80 per cup. Unsure if it's 24hrs, limited aircon from 11.30pm Sgt onwards.

The environment is nice. The service staff are polite however, the Supervisor/Manager seems grumpy as he was training the OJT/new staff. I was not very impressed with 3 things:1). Their toasted bread comes with a tiny piece of butter hardly to go anywhere on the bread. 2). The cleaning staff needs to be trained as this old lady has the habit of clearing the plates and cups unannounced. I almost lost my cup of tea, just in time to stop her from taking right under my nose.3). I notice the Supervisor/Manager who was training the staff was not smiling and that kind of was putting tension on the staff and the customers. My overall rating for the service staff other than the cleaning lady and the Supervisor/Manager is 7.5/10.The ambience and cleaniness is 8/10.The overall experience taking into account the negatives is 5.5/1

Been here twice at late night hours (past 11PM) and the service at that time is slow, disorganised and generally messed up.Both times we had missing orders, and you have to go and hound them for your food or it will never appear. Airconditioning for the building was probably turned off during night hours so that place is warm as heck (and I am one who advocates no aircon ok). If the place is built for aircon, you can't just switch it off and pretend to have natural ventilation (which doesn't exist).Food, when it arrived, is decent

After a day of being in Singapore and eating unfamiliar food, at last here's a restaurant that served food that taste like home.

Friendly service from the counter to the waiters. Affordable and nice food. They have Asian as well as Western. Had their wild mushroom soup. Good.

Came here for breakfast a few times when visiting family in Singapore, found it all very reasonably priced and was made fresh for you at all times. Staff were fine and could speak good English. Salads were nice as was the choice of food.
4
Good western food, moderately priced. Don't miss on the fried rice and sweet and sour chicken! People there tend to get chatty, can have a good conversation while grabbing breakfast.
4
This is a 24 hour, functional place to get nice cheap food that caters for westerners and also locals
3
Pretty average noodles but surprisingly the club sandwich is delicious. Not bad but I wouldn't make a special trip to go there to eat.

good coffee... food and service was so so... the price is quite expensive
it was closest to the place i stayed though

We stopped here for coffee two days ago, and they were the best flat whites we have had in Singapore. So, looking for a light meal we called back. A mix of European and eastern dishes, my wife has an omelette and chips whilst I enjoyed Hor Fun noodles with fish, prawn and chicken. Both meals were excellent and the staff were ultra friendly and efficient. Will highly recommend this restaurant

As my husband finishes work after 10 pm, it's a challenge to find halal food after that hour. We heard from friends about this cafe and decided to try it out. We were delighted as it's quiet and the menu has a variety of food from Asian to western delights. Definitely not to be missed if you are looking for halal food late into the night as this cafe is open 24 hours

Our worst meal in Singapore. A friend we met up with later (a local) described it accurately: "the food at Hanis is consistently mediocre." It doesn't help that it's pretty pricey. In this nation of excellent food and restaurants, don't waste time and money going to this place
