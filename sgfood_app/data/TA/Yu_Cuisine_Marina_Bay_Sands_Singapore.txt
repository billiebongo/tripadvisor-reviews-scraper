food is average, service is so so, but the price is over priced.
end up we went to another popular restaurant the next day what a different

The Shops at Marina Bay Sands の地下１階（Galleria Level）にあるレストランです。
チリクラブを食べる予定はあったもののお店は決めておらず、館内に置いてあった飲食店の案内の冊子にチリクラブの写真を載せているお店だったので、こちらに決めました。
土曜日の１７時過ぎに、大人７人で予約なしで行きましたが、すぐに入れました。
最初は２人連れが２～３組いるくらいでしたが、食事をしている間に次々にテーブルがうまっていったので、タイミングが良かったようです。
メニューの蟹料理のページを見ると、ブラックペッパークラブなどチリクラブ以外にも１０種類くらいあり、価格表示はすべて「seasonal price」でした。
注文したチリクラブは「Singapore chili crab with golden man tou」で 1.5kg ＄132（＄8.80/100g）でした。
マントウ（揚げパン）は人数分が用意されましたが、チリソースはマントウだけでは食べきれないほどたっぷりありました。
口から火が出そうな辛さでしたが、とても美味しかったです。
辛いのが大丈夫な同行者は、チャーハンにかけて食べていました。
飲み物を頼む際、メニューに「fresh coconut」とあったので、もしかして殻入り？と期待して注文、それがやってきました。
スプーン付なので内側の果肉も食べられました。
中国茶は大き目のポットでした。
おしぼり：＄0.30
タイガービール：＄12
ココナッツジュース：＄8
中国茶：＄2.20
炒めものやチャーハンはＳ・Ｍ・Ｌのサイズがあり、全員で食べる量としてＭサイズを店員さんからすすめられました。それでちょうど良い量でした。
注文が終わると、店員さんが紙製の前掛けをかけてくれました。
料理はそれほど待たずに始まり、ひとつ食べ終わる頃にちょうど次が来る感じでした。
チャーハンだけは、テーブルの横で人数分に取り分けてサーブされました。
前菜２種、炒めもの１種、チャーハン２種、チリクラブ１匹分と、各々の飲み物・デザートも合わせて＄454.20でした。

Average food with average prices... Service is ok... The waiter tried to be very nice but poorly lacked product knowledge ... Can try if you are around here.

I dined here with my family while shopping in Marina Bay as we were told that chilli crab in Singapore is a must-try. My dad chose the crab and we ordered fish as well and they gave us some dried fish to nibble on while waiting for the food. They cooked the crab in two ways so we get more value for our money as the Alaskan crab alone was worth around £300 but it was because we had a big one, a smaller one would be cheaper. The gave us some plastic aprons to use while eating to protect spills while opening the crab. The food was so delicious, we did not finish it all but they wrapped it for us to take home. This is more of a fine dining restaurant and the staff were very attentive to our needs. It is quite expensive due to the location and the origin if the crabs but it is definitely worth a try!

We were recommended this restaurant by a concierge type who assisted us at the locations map in one of the foyers,The restaurant was so quiet we thought it was closed until someone appeared after a few minutes of us looking at the menu and asked if we would like to be seated.After a couple of goes at ordering meals and drinks from the menu that were no longer available we received our mains, however the rice did not arrive until a while later. The food was average in the end, and have had much better back in Melbourne.The restaurant was not busy however service was slow at times and the waiting staff seemed disinterested. The place really lack atmosphere, however the decor was quite nice. Would not go back as we have come across many better restaurants with great atmosphere in Singapor
3
We found out during lunch that they are closing, which was apparent in the service & food. We have been twice before & had high expectations. Ordered the soup dumplings & seasame duck from dim sum as an entree. Our pepper steak came out first without the rice which arrived a good 10 minutes later. The chefs special seafood stir fry was more like a gravy & the soup dumplings very disappointing with nearly no liquid & rubbery wrapper. Ordered wine from the menu to be shown 3 whites which was all that was available as they were closing, even if they weren't closing we would not be back, bad chinese in Singapore who would of guessed

The waterfront bar upstairs this restaurant could work on making the venue more lively. Seems like a cheap cafe. Staff need some uplifting to be more welcoming and bring out the positive vibe. Drinks and dim sum decent. A very good location but work needs to be done to make it an interesting and fun bar
5
We went to YU cuisine without knowing it was there. What a surprise as the food served was very good. We had a very good sharkskin soup and some very fresh sautéed vegetable. Didn't plan to eat too much for lunch but the food we had was sufficiently filling and reasonable as well. Ask for their dumplings and shanghai Xiao long pao they are very good.

Marina Bay Sands has so many restaurants, one can be spoilt for choice. However Yu Cuisine is worth a try, if you want to eat dim sum with a refreshing "twist" to the traditional varieties one is accustomed to. The accompanying sauces are also not the standard chilly and sweet sauce.There is an omelette type dish but the "content" is cheong fun, and with a nutsauce mix that went perfectly. Then there is chilly crab tart, which tastes good but not outstanding. The items are not many but good enough as the portions are very decent sized (eg the omelette cheong fun). The porridge comes in very artistic and fancy crockery - nice touch! So if you are bored of the usual dim sum - try this place out!Do note, there is more than dim sum to this place, although we didn't check it out. On weekdays, they also have a tea set which looks pretty good value for money from 3pm to 5pm

Weekday dinner with the family at Yu Cuisine.Read that they are owned by same ppl behind Black Society restaurant at Vivo city.Some fanciful names for dim sum dishes but didn't get to try, only available for lunch.Had Peking duck which was tasty, prawns & fish was well cooked, fresh and moist.Abalone fried rice was within expectations.Service was very good, 2 staff running around 5 tables but they were there whenever we needed them.Paid less than $400 for 6 persons, not cheap but also not very expensive considering its at Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands
4
Our dining experience is enjoyable. There are a few unique dishes that is found here and not elsewhere. Service staff is attentive and doesn't give the impression that you are being watched.
4
Been patronising this place for a couple of years and food standard has been pretty consistent. The dim sum might not be the cheapest around but you do pay for what you get. The peking duck here is also one of their signature dishes and a definite must try. Their seafood pot is good value for a restaurant of this class. If decide to go for seafood like live fish or crabs, be prepared to pay premium. Quality is good but maybe not really worth the arm and a leg and maybe a few fingers pricing. You've been warned. Their desserts are delectable and if you still have space after a hearty meal, do give them a go.My advice would be to stick to the ala carte excluding the live seafood menu and dim sum you can't go wrong
3
Chanced upon this after shopping and were hungry.We ordered some DIM Sum, Soup and Noodle. Food is good. Service is good too. Maybe because there is only two tablesd at the section near the cashier counter and the waitresses passes by all the time ....We asked about their chilli crab and was told its SGD 8/100gram. We had Chilli Crab at Long Beach Dempsey which cost SGD 10/100gram. We did not order as we were already full
2
I have been using trip advisor for years and this is the first time writing a negative review.Food, drink and appetiser (I didn't even order) are served and charged without notice.Food tasted very normal.I'm never coming back to this restaurant again.Terrible dining experience
4
After a long walk we were pointed to this restaurant and decided to sit down whatever! Chilli crab claw was reasonably priced but not available. Chilli crab was S$125 (Â£65appx) but for six people and we were two. I chose spare ribs in honey/egg sauce (very good) and duck noodle soup (house special and a bit watery but okay). My wife had noodles with prawns and shredded duck (good) and giant prawns in a sauce between us (excellent). Lovely staff but naughty naughty they charged S$4.50 for nuts, which were on the table when we arrived, and S$0.60 for wet towels, neither of which had we ordered. However, the food was good, the service friendly and we would go again
2
Sat down to order the chili Crab, we relied entirely on our waitress to guide us through the experience. She basically suggested to split the crab order into two different seasoning, What she actually did was order two separate orders of crab. The cost of this order? About $500.00 we attempted to reduce the food order, it was too late both crabs came out in less than 5 mins. We did not feel we were treated fairly, the restaurant was empty now we know why. On a side note, the broccoli was delicious and so where the noodles, my suggestion is do let rely on your host/waitress to guide you. They will stick you with the most expensive meal you have experienced. When we complained to the Marina Bay Sands, management was useless

Came here a couple of years ago for dinner and had good impression of the food and place. Peviously we ordered the 4 person set meal with spicy crab, bamboo pith soup, fried rice and appetisier etc. The spicy crab was great, tasted exactly like hong kong style. Realised this place was related to the Bosses place in vivocity which we also tried and liked.This time we had simple yam cha and ordered scallop fried yam which was piping hot. beancurd rolls wrapped in cheong fun which was very tasty. charsiew and chicken liver cheong fun ok, soup dumplings delicious, charsiew buns had juices flowing out and very yummmy, and vegetarian dumplings that look like flowers. But warm water was chargable at $2.20 per glass where other restaurants serve FOC. Service was prompt and we had no complains. Dim sums were having 30% off during lunch.Overall, good food and we would come back again

Had arrived in Singapore for transit and were looking for a decent seafood restaurant in MBS when we stumbled across Yu Cuisine by chance. Overall the food was decent - we had ordered peking duck, shark fin soup, amongst other dishes - that were all very lovely. Combined with the stunning decor of the place, we were beyond pleased with our first restaurant experience in Singapore. The service was also lovely, and they were able to accommodate for our somewhat odd request for an iPhone 6 charger. Rather expensive, but as expected for such an establishment
1
We were a group of eight. The menu and overall ease of ordering was just not there--with the caveat that none of us spoke Mandarin. Overall the food that we ordered was OK--wanted to order Lobster but it was too pricey--but the level of service was rude, and it appeared at times that they were not organized to entertain non Mandarin guests.Not a place I would recommend
4
One of the few restaurants in MBS where a table was available without reservation and we were pleasantly surprised by the good food served by this Chinese restaurant. Although it is not one of the big names in MBS, both food and service are of high quality. Its interior is modern (although the more conservative may fine its lighting a little too dark for a restaurant) and some tables have a great view of the waterfront. They have a good wine list to go with the food too. Definitely a keeper! This goes to my lil black book of best places to dine and wine in Singapore
1
Bad food but worst service. Avoid this tourist trap. The servers were rude, the food was poor quality and the prices were terrible!
4
great food with an awesome view, their wine collection is very good and the hostesses are very well trained , both on the aspect of helping guests with the food selection and with regional preferences.
4
a little pricey but you are paying for the ambience. true chinese fare without over complicating it. service can be slow at times but again in singapore this is kind of like the norm.
4
If your looking for nice fresh chinese with polite simple service & for Marina Bay not too expensive this is the place. Dont pass on an entree the soup dumplings are fantastic.
1
We went there for a drink at their happy hour. Well happy hour does not mean happy hour for you as you'd expect but for there it's them instead.
So we choose not to eat there.
2
On our last day in Singapore we decided to stop in here as I hadn't yet had Singapore chilli crab and they had it on the menu. Unfortunately the crab was market price and too expensive in my opinion, so we went for dim sum instead.I'd chosen 4 dishes for two of us (although many of the dishes were unavailable as one of the chefs was 'having a rest') and asked if they thought that was enough. They recommended another and not knowing portion sizes I ordered another dish.We had pork ribs, pork dumplings, carrot cake, salt egg buns and chilli crab tarts. The dumplings and carrot cake were delicious & the others were ok, but not outstanding. And we had way too much. We certainly could have done without the extra dish.We didn't get any water with our meal and the drinks we'd ordered didn't come until we'd nearly finished our meal. As a few of the dishes were spicy, we really needed some water and even though we'd asked for some, we never got any.Definitely bypass this place as the food wasn't fantastic, the service was poor and it wasn't great value for money
4
We had a healthy sized, but limited, budget for a business dinner party and decided on Yu Cuisine. The managers made a number of helpful accommodations on the menu to suit our requirements. On the evening of the event, some of our guests reported that they felt the cold shoulder from some of the staff as well as the manager. I didn't feel that way, but that's what a number of our guests said. Would have been an otherwise delightful experience

Our Singapore based-friend took us here for our Chinese New Year lunch. We ordered the chili crab, peking duck and the prawns coated with salted egg (can't remember the name). Everything we ordered was delicious, esp the prawns. That coating was unbelievable. It was my first time tasting this dish. The chili crab was great especially with the cute little mantou buns to sop up the sauce with. My husband loved the duck. We wanted to keep eating but cholesterol worries kind of tempered our enthusiasm. The portions were more than enough for 3 people. Being used to the ridiculous portion sizes in the US, I was expecting there wouldn't be leftovers to take home but I was pleasantly proven wrong. I can't comment much about the ambience since I was too busy catching up with my friend so I didn't really notice the decor. I do remember it being classy enough. I would give this place 3.5 stars but that isn't available so I'll round it up instead
4
At the far end of the Marina Sands development, a bit off pitch, but that makes getting a table easier. I had a table outside and not being sure what I wanted to eat, was offered a range of specials. Seafood with noodles was excellent. Choice of beer was a bit limited but overall, the food, atmosphere and service was good. Good value
5
My husband and I just came across this restaurant when walking along the waterfront. We weren't sure if it was open when we asked they didn't open till 4 but the lady said she would open early for us. This was about 2.30pm which was so kind of her. My husband and I shared the dim sum which is 8 pieces, and we also had the medium seafood fried rice in xo sauce. The medium is enough for 3-4 people. The food is delicious. The lady that served us was very friendly and helpful.I would go back again
5
food is really good am open for new things and learning about local cuisine and this one is really good excellent presentation
3
Comparing the prices, quality is just average. Prices are on a bit higher side. The taste is just like any other normal Chinese restaurant.

Not the worst restaurant we've visited in Singapore but a long way from the best! We went there for lunch & in particular to try their Singpore Crab.The service was generally very poor.We finally got served, after about half an hour wait, despite the fact that there were only two other tables occupied in the restaurant. However even then our main course actually arrived before one of our starters which we obviously then cancelled. The waitress then sulked for the rest of the meal & refused to serve us again! The single Dim Sum starter we did have was OK although not as good as Din Tai Fung & twice the price. To be fair the Chili Crab was excellent, albeit rather expensive at over $80 for a single crab. We wouldn't bother to eat here again

Walking through Marina Bay and was drawn in by their Happy Hour sign of "30% off beer and wine by the glass" so we ordered a jug of Tiger and sat down. Uncomfy chairs aside it was fine. Comes time for the bill and not only do they charge more than what the price is on the menu but they don't give the discount because they say it's beer and wine "by the glass". I guess grammar counts. I point out the charge and the balk at changing it until I insist and they still don't give me the discount. Final straw, besides being rude, they tried to trick me into charging my Visa twice. Scammers!!! Lots of places to have a drink in Singapore so cut a wide berth around these unscrupulous innkeepers.

This took place while having dinner on Aug 8. Here are the reasons why the service was terrible:- Manager who took our order recommended us to choose the large portion for 4 out of 6 dishes even though we only have 5 adults out of 10 pax!- Manager gave the 'i dont you can afford' look when taking our orders. - When the food came and we questioned her about the portion, she replied bluntly 'i change to medium portion for you!' (Sigh: wonder why they want to be in the service line with this type of attitud

premise - located in a not so prominent area of MBS so it's good! why?! less crowd! :)location - MBSstaff - ok, nothing to shout about. Menu should be updated as there were many unavailable dishes and the quality of the menu is quite bad - dog ears and perpetual wrinkles on the pages.food - also OK, nothing to shout about. but! the veg is 'FRESH' cos i found a tiny worm in it. nothing really, just proves that Yu Cuisine buys from natural vegetable producers that uses less / no pesticides :)price - very reasonable for the place and type of foodverdict - the sister company: Bosses @ Vivo is better
3
Came here for a dim sum lunch and I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of food I got for the price I paid. This restaurant charges about 8 dollars or so for 3 pieces of dim sum per basket which in Singapore standard is relatively expensive per piece (so you would expect good dim sum if you're paying that amount!). However, the food was not up to my expectations, to add insult to injury, the dim sum was not even hot when it arrived. It is restaurants like these in Singapore which makes me lose faith in the Chinese restaurants here
4
I had a very favorable impression of their food. I felt it was traditional yet creative. I had never seen the description "substitute shark's fin" on a menu before but I ordered it in soup and it was fine. Shark's fin is a texture food anyway and it is good to have a substitute, given the sustainability issues surrounding it, and be up front about it. It is on the expensive side but what do you expect at the Marina Bay Sands
2
Like most restaurants here in Singapore, this place is expensive. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone eating in this area. Sadly this place excels at price gauging by placing a couple of cashews in a small bowl in the middle of a table, not unlike many other restaurants that have some nibbles available while you peruse the menu, but without mentioning it charges you $5.30 for a handful of nuts on the bill. Another surprise was the charge of $2.50 per person for tap water which so far has been free at the other restaurants we frequented. The 30c per serviette was standard. We had the Peking duck, which was nicely done but had far less pancakes available than duck skin. If you want to have a second course with the leftover duckmeat, something that has been included in every other Peking Duck meal I have had around the world, there is a surcharge of $10 for the noodles or rice to be added to the duck meat. Considering Peking duck is already charged at a premium as it should consist of 2 or 3 courses, compared to roast duck, this is a further insult. The food was fine, but ending up paying extra for everything that should be included when the meal itself is already charged at top dollar leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth
3
I joined a group of my colleages for dinner at Yu. We shared a set menu which was OK. Highlights were the "New Year Salad" - great intro from the waiter, chilli crab and the cod.Overall average and if compared to other chinese restaurants around a little disappointing- eg at the Mandarin Oriental
4
Went there for lunch. A beautiful, clean place that serve great dim sum. The service was poor though.
4
Love the food and the fried fish and soy sauce chicken was one of the better ones that I have ever tasted. Nice ambience and decent Chinese food. However, the dessert portion is small and does not really justify for the price.
2
The exterior look leaves an impression that the modern Chinese restaurant is expensive.The food wasn't extraordinary. It's what you can get from any Chinese restaurant. The worst part was the service. The servers were friendly and courteous but it took them so long to serve what we ordered. We had to make several follow-ups. It appeared they had forgotten to take down some of the items we ordered
3
Just visited with relatives for dim sum today. Heard some negative reviews but we decided to give it a try ourselves anyway. There were about 3 tables occupied when we stepped in at about 12.30p.Food quality is reasonable, price is slightly on the high side, service nothing to shout about, but there were 2 incidents that disappoints me. When we asked for a baby high chair for the second time, then we realized that the waiter did not know what it is as we saw him asking an indian colleague who pointed one to him.The same waiter also gave the wrong information that we can redeem parking with UOB credit cards. However, that is only applicable from Mondays to Thursdays only. We felt that as a service provider, we rely on them for such information and never expect to be misled or given wrong information.Good to try if you have spare time/money or no better options
1
As the saying goes, first impression last. My impression of the restaurant is very disappointing and it will last! I went there to have a dinner with my girl friend, and they double charge my credit card and up until now they say they will give me a refund but still have not received it yet!!! I hope the will close their restaurant and replace it with another one, that is why when we went their to eat there were few people eating!!! never will I go back there to eat again!!! it sucks! it is lousy! I hate the restaurant!!!
2
I went to Yu Cuisine last year and even brought my clients to the restaurant for dim sum lunch. I like that the restaurant wasn't over-crowded, and the food was really tasty back then. But when I returned for another visit again early this year. The quality of the food have dropped tremendously! I've never been there again ever since
3
We had lunch at this restaurant. The setting was good with attentaive service. However the dimsum quality was very average and the fried beancurd dish had too much gravy and a bit too salty. One would expect for more refined Chinese food in a nicely decorated restaurant inside the Marina Sands shopping mal
4
Arrived a few minutes early to meet two friends for a Dim Sum lunch today. The restaurant wasn't busy however there was an awkward moment in how to deal with a walk-in. It turned out we had a booking which wasn't needed in the end.The blue dÃ©cor was different - inside the door were live fish and crustacean tanks - plenty of choices for the seafood lover. The Dim Sum was delicious, each dish had portions for each diner. This eliminated that awkward decision of who will have the "odd" piece.Staff were attentive with service to match
3
We also arrived late - at 2220, were immediately told that we need to order now otherwise kitchen closes. When tried to order, half of the meals were not available (dim sums, etc). Some time after the order, they also came and advised that another meal was not available.So while roasted duck and pork and pork ribs were OK, service was really far from perfect. We didnt like their supposedly signature durrian mochi, unless I dont get it, it was pretty disgusting.And they charge even for chinese tea and wet napkinsSo find another place and MB
1
Our hotel booked us there at our request for 10 pm. We arrived at 10:15 and were explained that (a) the kitchen closed at 10:30 so we could not expect to order whatever was on the menu and (b) since they closed at 11 we would have to leave then eg., we would have to eat our dinner in 20 minutes. This was done in a reasonably rude manner. When I remonstrated that they allowed to come all the way to their restaurant and told to eat an expensive dinner in 20 minutes, they were unapologetic. We left

Very conveniently located serving one of the better food The pan Asian or whatever you name it Cantonese ,Chinese is worth every Penney.Service very courteous and prompt.Can not say which is the best dish we tried quite a few and liked them.
4
My family had lunch there during our stay in Marina Bay Sands. The service is good and trust the staff's recommendations ! Seafood is guaranteed fresh !
5
We have Chinese "tapas". The food was very good. I liked all the food, especially the custard buns.
4
I have always walked past this blue restaurant but never had a chance to enter. I like the idea that they changed their dimsum menu every season. Even though some may find the choices rather limited, but well there is still the ala carte lunch/dinner menu which has many tempting offerings. For details : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/10/yu-cuisine.html Must Try-Signature chilli crab tart. Don't be deceive by the looks. The spicy warm sg chilli crab filling just flows once you take a bite. The tart shell is crispy but not oily and there is no trace of any sogginess. Trio Eggs Rabbit dumplingA savoury dish filled with century egg and some mixed vegetables. The skin is too thick so even though it may be cute looking but this is not worth ordering.Steam spare ribs and glass noodle basket.Traditional chicken feet in BBQ sauce. Shredded roast duck sesame pastryA dark horse of the day.Spicy duck meat filling with crispy Chinese pastry skin. The skin has many layers but not oily. A good alternative to our usual char siew puff or char siew bao( they are on the menu too)Mango with prawns black sesame rollCrispy deep fried prawn drizzled with some green mayonnaise that is definitely not wasabi mayo.Dinosaur rice roll that is drizzled with some special sauce with spring onionsAs highly recommended by other bloggers, this one is indeed another star by its huge dinosaur size. Good value for $$.The interior consists of deep fried fritter and turnips. Do not shy away from ordering this even though it is deep fried as they are not greasy at all. The diff textures of this dish paired with the sauce makes it taste heavenl

Bad attitude from the lady (whom i presume is a supervisory staff) who took our orders. She was disinterested to facilitate our orders and wasn't at all helpful when we asked for recommendations. In the end we ended up with 4 dishes - including a steamed sole fish/turbot paying SG$350. The fish alone costs $180 and it was so overcooked that it was tough and chewy! The portions were small for 6 adults dining. Apart from the edible roast duck, everything else (steamed fish, signature tofu dish, kailan vegetable) were really below expectations for a restaurant which prides itself in the fine-dining category.
5
Lunch is always fantastic here. Service is always attentive but not intrusive. We try to eat here once every trip to Singapore. The menu is small but seems to be constantly changing. The dishes are always good, with some unusual and not found in other restaurants

Since we have been here we can still not understand how such a restaurant can get chosen by MBS to serve for in their mall.It is a shame for 5 star hotels to have something like this close.Beside the fact that the seats all have stains and look dirty, the staff apparently never received a proper training in their job. Also is their English for such an international place extremly bad.About the food, we can say that the food was ok, but nothing special. You can get the same quality at Newton Hawker Centre.Then when we got the bill we got the nice surprise. The charged us for the napkins we had on the table 0.30 Cents each. Then they charged us for the chips the brought when we arrived (never ordered, normally offered from the restaurant) and they charged us for a dumpling set we did not order but the waiter suggested.It does not matter if the restaurant situats itself for the higher class customers, such behavior is never alright.The last but biggest point for us is, they serve shark fins. This gave it the rest and I can not understand how MBS can support that.So out of the 5 points you start:-1 dirty seats-1 untrained staff-1 bill-10 sharkfinAnd the 5 to 10 $ shown for prices on TripAdvisor is wrong. It is more 25 - 100

Love coming to Singapore for the Chili and Pepper crab. Been walking pass this restaurant several times. I thought I would give it a try even though a number of restaurants at the Marina Bay Sands mall are quite disappointing. We wanted to have pepper crab and the waitress suggested we should try this special crab from Australia. It costs S$285.60. Why not. But I regretted it as soon as I tasted the crab. Jumbo and Red House definitely have better pepper sauce. This crab from Australia is dry, not meaty and tasteless. Had a tough time getting the meat out in one piece. The crab meat was stuck to the shell like crazy glue. BBQ pork belly is tough and hard.... Oh dear

It was rather difficult to find as it's located on the second floor of the casino but it's worth the effort as the quality fo food and service were both excellent. The peking duck was among the best that we have eaten. The golden shrimp (shrimp covered with salty egg yolk was also among the best we have eaten, then the glutenous rice, the bbq pork were also among the best. It's not as pricey as we thought it would be. Dinner for 8 cost 250USD and we think it is reasonable.

This restaurant was a complete joke. The interiors are so jazzy, it feels like you are in some 70s cheesy club. The seats are uncomfortable, the tissue paper at the restrooms does not come out, the bins are electronic and don't work, but worst of all is the service. The manager who's name I didn't care to remember was terrible, rude, didn't provide any suggestions and looked at us with a disdainful look. We had one drink and left this place. Don't g here! There are plenty of very good options right next doors
