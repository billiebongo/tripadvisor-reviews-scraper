This is my second time back to the restaurant. Excellent service rendered. Nice food and most important worth the $$.
3
Service is quite good but I find the seafood overcooked. Army stew and kimchi is good and recommended.
5
Delicious food, seafoods are fresh, nice ambient and excellent service. A good venue for group gathering and eating.
5
Food Portion are good and price is rather affordable. Located at a really convenient location too. The Staffs are all very friendly and smiley. And there's also free flow of kim-chi.
4
Nice food, inexpensive.. Fresh seafood and lots of side dishes. Service is great.. The buffet option is worth your money as you get seafood tower, free flow of side dishes etc.. Reservations recommended,
3
Value for money if you go for buffet, although only 3 tier K-tower, it is sufficient for 4 person as there are other free flow cook foods to order. the seafood pancake, chicken wings are quite nice.

Son asked to come here again for his birthday. The seafood is Super fresh and yummy. We also love the free flow kimchi!
4
Food was great. As we went on the weekends, it wasn't packed with people due to the location. Free flow of kimchi and other side dishes. Ordered the army stew instead of the seafood tower as there were only 3 of us. Will visit again with a bigger group to conquer the tower
4
The restaurant is nicely decorated with the pots on the wall. Now it's Christmas so it has special Christmas decoration. The ordered a 7-tire seafood tower, the price is cheaper than other seafood tower restaurants. The lobsters are live and fresh. The oysters are big. The service is nice as the waitresses are always smiling and come to you at your need. Definitely would come again
4
free-flow banchan (tradition of most korean restaurants) varies and will be served to you. fetch kimchi and sauces on your own at a small counter. 4 of us so ordered a 3-tier with army soup base (+$10) and a platter (to add into the soup) and a seafood pancake. the seafood in the 2 tiers are pretty fresh and tasty. the seafood pancake is a big disappointment. service is prompt and servers are friendly and helpful. however, this is the kind of place that one will visit once for the experience that's it. though it is not considered expensive, it is not really the regular fare
3
We order seafood tower , prawn is fresh and good,clams has a lot sand difficult to eat, not recommend to order clams from sea food tower
4
Redeem 6 free oysters from spinning the wheel and the free oysters were fat and juicy! Also had the ginseng chicken which was delicious but a little expensive. Overall, great visit.
5
I had dinner with my family members. We enjoyed the seafood and will definitely recommend friends to this place.
5
Various kind of seafood at an affordable price. Round tables are available for big groups. The staff are very friendly and helpful
4
Redeemed the army stew, pancake and chicken wings from the loyalty card and it was all worth. Food was decent but a little expensive. The ginseng chicken soup and trilogy rice cake were tasty.
2
Poor food quality. It was my second visit but still quality of food has not improved. A lot of food items were out of stocks. Lousy
4
It's quite an experience to dine in this restaurant where they serve your seafood in steamers. You can choose the different tiers combo depending on your group size. The seafood are mainly steamed, you can request for oysters to be separated and also to throw your shells into the soup for better tasting

Made a mid-week dinner booking through Chope and everything was a breeze, they even make this automated call in the day to confirm it.Not crowded - but this is mid-week - and the service was good. They also have a buy 3 get 1 free promo for their buffet, which comes with free flow side dishes (the chicken wings are good), as well as free flow ingredients for the hot pot at the bottom, which makes it pretty worth it. the seafood that comes on top as part of the 'tower' are a one-off. The seafood is pretty decent although I found the clams/mussels a bit dry. But it was plentiful and to be honest I could barely eat the hotpot at the end because I was so ful
4
Been wanting to try out the tier tower but no chance.. Just nice it's Chope Anniversary and there's a good offer thus bought the voucher & went to try it out with family. We ordered the 3-tier with some side dishes. Seafood from the tier was fresh... There's also buffet menu which will give it a try next time
4
had my first korean concept steamed seafood tower with my parents, we love the three tier tower as it offers a good variety of seafood for us to sample. Very friendly and attentive staff with good customer service and made a very memorable dining experience. The vegetable broth was sweet and tasty. A pity that the shellfish were over cooked. Overall, my family had enjoyed dining at K Tower!
5
Celebrated my aunt's birthday here and the food and service were excellent. Food was fresh and delicious, and service staff attentive. Too bad they didn't have a small birthday cake too offer but nonetheless we had a great time.
3
Food was average but pricey. Variety is quite limited but would recommend the buffet which seems more worthy.
3
Nothing amazing or extraordinary. The army stew soup was pretty tasteless and watery but the chicken wings definitely made up for it. Seafood was mediocre.
4
went with a few friends. food was good and staff were attentive despite being busy. will be back. booking essential
3
The buffet is worth it and the service staff was helpful to change our 3-tier to the buffet. Will definitely visit again.
4
The restaurant has good ambiance. The food are average but is value for money. The staff are friendly and attentive.
3
Celebrated my birthday and was pleasantly surprised that we were given a free pancake to mark the occasion. The staff are very friendly with special note to the senior staff (it was a gentlemen) who was always looking out if we need anything.
4
Second visit to k-tower and this time to try their buffet. Food is generally not bad and seafood is fresh. However, the seafood pancake on this visit was a little disappointing as compared to my first visit.
3
This is a nice novelty and we had fun doing it the first time. The quality of seafood was fresh but some of the items like clam and crab were quite small in size. The cooked dishes like Korean fried chicken and seafood pancake were good. Overall food standard was good but may not justify revisiting in near future. Service was prompt and accommodating but can be more polished. Will recommend more for casual dinning or need a change from usual routines
3
Was here to enjoy the Pay 3 for 4 adults promotion. First time eating seafood tower, so was wondering what the rage was. Granted, the food remains fresh and is definitely more healthy, but beyond the side dishes that you can't get home, it might be better to buy your own fresh seafood and steam them at home? That said, some of the korean dishes were good. We enjoyed both the seafood pancake and the fried chicken wings and the free-flow kimchi was also good
5
Service as usual was fantastic, opted for the army stew instead of the seafood this time and we were stuffed with the amount that we were served. Exactly what I was craving for. Would totally suggest the pancake and the fishcake skewers. Absolutely delicious.
3
Food was okay. Pancake was overcooked and slightly dark at the bottom.. Scallop and Oysters are delicious.
5
First timer, tried a 5-tier seafood towers. Food portion was not alot but i am happy with the taste. Free flow of kimchi and pickles which i had alot, it was nice and crunchy unlike other plc which can be soggy.
4
Was there for lunch. Their lunch sets are very good - value for money. The ginseng chicken is good. Their unlimited serving kimchi is the best in town!
3
Service was good but food quality was normal for the steam tower & also limited choice.
cook food was good. the staff was v alert constantly checking on us clearing our table as well.
3
Above average food, nice environment to catch up with friends (not too noisy). Remember to try their sauces and kimchi!
5
The family thoroughly enjoyed the experience! There was more than enough food to go around with 7 of us. Service was good, staff were attentive :)
4
The service was friendly and prompt. We enjoyed the food. The place was not cramped as some Korean eateries and we sat there for about 3 hours , chit chatting and eating.
3
Not friendly staff, discrimation of Chope voucher users, where we paid for ala-carte seafood tower (not even going for buffet) and the voucher is for only 10% off the bill, also cannot be entitled to claim loyalty points on card, despite spending $100++ on their food bill. Lousy! Won't return
5
Was there on Sunday, 16 Jul 2017. Simple and nice setting. The seafood are so fresh! There is a small station with free flow kimchi and reddish together with 6 different sauces for you to mix your own. The kimchi is so good! Totally worth the money. The host/waitress who attended to us is friendly and helpful, I can't remember her name but she was lovely. The waiter and another waitress not so. They are there playing and teasing among themselves and did not watch if customers need anything. I raised my hand and they did not see so I have to call them out just to remove one layer of the steamer. The management should take note of this 2.This 5 stars is given because of the lovely host
5
Fantastically fresh seafood. Amazing atmosphere and the seafood pancake was amazing. Easily one of the best in Singapore. Prices are less steep then competitors. Service was impeccable. Amazing experience. Would love to go again.
4
Korean steamboat with muti tiers. Good food. Wish they have more promotions. Or they allow people to choose the food in the tiers given a fixed price.
3
Disappointed that the crew did not notify us the one-for-one deal from Chope. Food taste is average but the ingredients are honestly fresh.
5
Brought my folks for lunch. We ordered the 5 tier tower and they enjoyed the meal thoroughly. In fact my mum is already requesting that I take her back to K Tower to celebrate her birthday. LOL
4
Had the 7-tier tower, seafood were fresh and succulent. Prices are only the expensive side. Staff were responsive and professional.
4
The seafood was very fresh and the spicy rice cakes were very good too. Servicewas quick and attentive. Needed more variety of veg.
4
whiie fish was fresh, it was slightly overcooked. In addition, there were plenty of scales on the fish
3
Ordered the 2-3 pax tower. They have only 8prawns,3corn,3brocolli,3purple potato, 3 osyters, 3scallops ,muscles and clams. Overall experience is so so only.

Customer services not so good. Having hard time to get some good service. Could see them talking on their mobile phone when you need them to make some order. Does not seem happy when you need their help. Their crab not so bad but it would better they could help to smash the crab abit so we having hard time to peel the shell off
