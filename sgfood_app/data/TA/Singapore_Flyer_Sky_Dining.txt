It is very expensive, and there are most certainly better places to dine in Singapore. I wasn't even really blown away by the view from the top, unless you count the Coldplay concert that was happening at a nearby arena. Skip it.

Have a peaceful dinner sharing the cabin with a family of 4. It is not that crowded in the weekdays comparing to weekend. The food was nicely prepared. The waitress was attentive to our needs.

We booked a dining capsule on the flyer so that we could have dinner taking in the spectacular views over marina bay.The staff were really nice and we had 2 rotations on the flyer while we ate our 4 course meal.Although the food was nice we didn't think it was value for money and just expected a bit better for $350.Having said that we did have a great time got some super photos and we wouldn't have missed the experienc

The dining experience was great, with the accompanying view at sundown and dark being the best! Pre lounge area was chilled, enjoying a Singapore Sling cocktail. The Singapore Flyer pod had two dinner tables, plenty of room and privacy. We had a four course meal doing two meals per round trip on the Flyer, taking an overall 2 hours. The dessert was the best Drinks was separately billed before the dining, in the lounge area. Friendly staff, treated us like VIP's

This was my second time on Singapore flyer but 1st time Dining in the capsule. That day was my husband's birthday. So, I want to have something special for him. So, I have booked a month ahead through their online website. My husband loves it and it was his 1st time on Singapore flyer . We are served in a lounge while waiting for our ride. We can feel the privilege on board while we can see others looking at our capsule while we dine. There are 5 tables (up to 5 couples) in the dining capsules. During our visit, there are 2 other couples that are also very friendly. The food was good too. If you would like to order some extra food or drink, you have to order 1st and wait for the wheel to complete it's 1st round. 2nd round is the end of the sky dining ride.

Highly recommend the lobster. It was so fresh and delicious. The fish was good, but the lobster stole the evening taster. The service is amazing. The same service you would expect from a fine dinning restaurant. We had a bottle of French wine for S$60. Great wine! Thanks for the great evening. You can see the garden by the bay light show daily at 7:45 and 8:45pm. Great view

My husband and I dined on the flyer to celebrate my 50th Birthday a cost of $350AUD per couple, Food Only - All drinks extra. We had a 7.30pm booking. On arrival at 7pm - we were taken to a waiting room and offered a drink at a ridiculously expensive cost - which we declined, we boarded our Pod at 7.50pm, with two other groups, although there was plenty of room so no complaints there. Our first course arrived immediately which was Waldorf Salad, ok - but pretty hard to mess up, 2nd course was Potato & Leek soup - sadly this was powdered and not made from scratch - it was just awful. On completion of our first rotation our Main Course and dessert were rushed into our pod from behind a curtain by ground staff - our meals were not covered AT ALL - not sure how long they were sitting there for. Our Lobster Thermidor was delivered straight away, its was cold, over cooked and tasted like rubber, dessert however was the highlight of the night.We had two nice young girls serve us throughout the evening, one waitress was teaching the other, it was her first night and had absolutely no idea what to do and also could not speak english, which frustrated the other waitress as all the work was falling on to her. The waitress were dressed in white tops, black jeans and runners, certainly not how I would expect them to be dressed - not even a small apron. Overall definitely NOT worth the money we paid - there are plenty of other places in Singapore you could get value for money, including the view and even have a wine or beer included in the price

We took the evening flight to enjoy the city at night. The staff were very attentive, and were happy to take photos before and during the flight.The food was nicely cooked and the view from the capsule is the best way to see Singapore at night.Recomend the Singapore Sling!Expensive, but worth it

Singapore Flyer Sky Dining is quite pricey - we booked online from Australia and during the menu we were eating from it was 179S$ each.We honestly didn't know what to expect other than the fact we could be in a cabin with 8 other people... I had visions of uncomfortable conversations around a massive table....Thankfully the booths were set us with smaller, more intimate tables. We only shared with one other couple, but it felt like we pretty much had the pod to ourselves. The menu is seasonal, my husband and I had Western meal options which included a Waldorf Salad, Potato and leak soup, and chocolate cake - for main there was a choice of a few dishes that needed to be selected in advance. I had the Lobster option and my husband had the beef.The experience itself was just great, the revolutions weren't overly fast and the meal lasted 2 complete rotations. We booked the 7:30 sitting and we're privy to the SuperTree light show and the Marina Bay Sans lazer display which made it even better.The few things that changed my rating from a 5 to a 4 were the fact meals were all pre-prepared... I didn't realize the salad had nuts on it until I checked in, when asked if the could be left off I was declined. For the price, a glass of sparkling would have been a welcome edition... all drinks aside from water needed to be paid for. Desert was served quite late in the "flight" and I felt a bit rushed finishing it.If you do have the money Sky Dining is a great activity and I would recommend it - just ensure to outline ALL dietary complications on booking, even if you don't think they'll apply

You can view the beautiful skyline at Singapore Flyer when enjoying the delicious dishes for Sky Dining.

Very nice must do when in Singapore. Capsule of flyer is very safe. Air-conditioning very good. You will feel no problem when flyer capsule at top.

you won't feel you're rotating. you'll just be kept mesmerized by the different landmarks you need to identify while trying to savor the tastes of the dishes offered to you.it's one of a kind experience.

What a delicious 4 course meal. We had a cold seafood salad to start, spicy pumpkin soup, chicken and cheese main meal that was sooo delicious and cheesecake for dessert. Incredible!!!

My boyfriend took me to have dinner as a surprise at this sophisticated capsule. I have been there twice just for the ride, but it was my first time having dinner inside of the capsule and we lucked out to be the only couple without having to pay extra to rent the entire capsule and saved a thousand plus bucks! We both chose the Western Menu, I chose the Miso-Glazed Salmon as the Main Course and he chose the Duck Confit with Paris Mash. The service was excellent and personalised, and the dishes served were well-executed with a proper presentation. It was very romantic dinner with a breathtaking view of Singapore's night life from hundreds feet tall. I recommend this place if you are celebrating or for any special occasion, everything was just stunning and unforgettable

The food quality is degrading, compared to few years ago when we took the same package. They even had special tea few years ago, and this time only serve lipton tea. The capsule also has some wind leaking in, which is a bit scary especially when they wind is blowing hard. For 269++ per couple, i think we wont be doing it again, because the food quality is not worth in my opinion. For those who never do it, probably can try it for the adventure itself and see the view with not many crowd.

Went with my husband and had a fantastic experience. Best time to go is early evening to see the sunset and see the lights come on everywhere.The dinner was exquisite and delicious, 5 courses, each one beautifully served. Would highly recommend this dinner event and even though it is not cheap, it is a very memorable experience

I booked this as an exceptional birthday meal, for my wife and self. Booking on the website was simple and although somewhat expensive, i thought what the hell. So last night was the big night, arrived at the Singapore flyer and was directed to the guest services office, no problem, verified CC details and were escorted to the Flyer Lounge, and that is where the downhill slide started.....Entering the lounge, again asked for tickets and double checking, I guess no-one can be to careful, then was presented with the drinks menu, firstly both the drinks menus were held together with duct tape, bit of a giggle i guess, but the prices would shock even Donald Trump. Never mind I tell myself, its her birthday so just don't sweat it, prices for wine are some 400% more than you will pay at Cold Storage for the same wine, and some 500% for a 330ml tiger ( ++ ) don't forget the (++), however a bottle of house white and 3 tigers were purchased, for on the flyerService standard from the staff at the lounge, you will get better service at Mc'D's. So onto the flyer, led around to the boarding, it is a wheel and they don't stop it so they had to have us ready then boarding......onto the dining car and directed to the nearest seat. It was all still quite exciting at this point, but the illusion of excitement soon turned to ????, WT* over. The flyer pods, has christmas snow flakes on the glass, where were opaque and distorted the view when you stood up to see the view. When seated at the table there is no view as your vision line is right at the steel frame, forcing you to look down, or stand up to see. Lucky for us we were at the back of the pod, hint make sure you sit looking back not forward or you will have no view. Food was served with a smile starter that was quite tasty, so things had a glimmer of looking up, then soup came, was ok but the service of the food led a lot to be desired with the server leaning over the table and displaying the personality of a robot. That pretty much sums up the first revolution, then the main came, of course, chicken or beef, we shared both, the food had it been hot would have been quite enjoyable, but alas it was luke warm and rather par say. The dessert was good, chocolate mousse ball thingy, don't know what it was as previously stated the robot didn't answer questions. Needless to say Singapore Flyer management I am bitterly disappointed and want my money back, for the same price we could have gone to the Marina Bay Sands flight bar, feasted on oysters and other yummies, drunk Singapore slings, beer, other cocktails and had change in my pocket with an equal or better view and far superior service. Singapore Flyer give yourself a uppercut, provide the service customers expect and make just maybe you will be what you tout yourselves out as, but right now your a solid 2 out of 10, and definitely are not a premium attraction. Disappointed +

I have joined the tea set dining in Singapore flyer and I am disappointed in what they served. Firstly I would expect they would set up the formal table with two chairs for my hubby and me. I don't mind to share the cable car with others but I would think we would have separated table and chairs. It wasn't and even there was one table and put all food on it.For the drink there is less choices and only fruit punch, tea bag and instant coffee can be served. The food wasn't very taste and looked cheap though!

Arrived an hour before our booking as we were warned not to be late and thought we would have time to soak up the atmosphere of it all. On arrival it was suggested that we should go straight on, so we had to hurriedly give our drinks order then briskly rush up the ramps and through closed curtains to join the short queue waiting to alight. Once boarded the 4 courses were served one after the other without any time to digest the food while the flyer completes two revolutions, at the end of the second revolution you are ushered to the door and told you must depart even although we and others were not finished our sweet course. As you are seated during your meal the views are restricted so it would have been better if they added a third revolution between courses to allow guests time to enjoy experience. Would recomend going for the straight flight then elsewhere for a meal

We had booked dining cabin in the flyer. Dining in Singapore flyer was one of most memorable moment of our trip.
Although the food was bit costly but service provided was excellent that overshadowed the cost part. Staff members were all humble and helpful.

We did this activity for our anniversary one year and it was great! The experience was great! Good food and nice atmosphere. Small portions but that is all of Asia.

Food is very good, excellent service with fantastic view, very recommend day & night. Better to sit near the window

It's beautiful and experience is wonderful...must visit this place when you are in Singapore...it's located by the water front.,you can see the beauty of Singapore during night with all the lights burning.it's amazing

Stay away from Sky Dining at the Singapore Flyer, so many things done subpar, doesn't even deserve 1 star. It is obvious Singapore Flyer is losing money and cutting costs at every opportunity. Very unfortunately they are doing so with their fine dining experience, which is worse than a 1-2 star cruise ship experience at a 5-star price. We selected Sky Dining for our 15th wedding anniversary celebration, and it is officially the worst anniversary experience we'll have to remember. The food & service were absolutely awful, the view was unfortunate, and a for an overpriced $400/couple. The young girl responsible for serving in the dining capsule was busy texting most of the time, except when time to serve the next subpar course. Ask for anything "out of the ordinary" such as water, and "cannot"... We were told if we wanted water (even tap water they could easily serve from a pitcher), we should have informed them before boarding. The salad was wilted and fishy, the soup was bland, only one small slice from a baguette is served. If you would like more bread or more than one packet of butter, again "cannot". There is coffee available even if you don't order ahead of time...instant coffee crystals, just add water (yuck!). Strange they have water for an ad hoc instant coffee request, isn't it? And as for the view, many of the windows were very dirty such that you couldn't see out them. Secondly, the height of the dining tables relative to the capsule structure, makes it impossible to have a seamless view from the table without standing or hunching over. And to wrap up the night once dessert is served, you are rushed out of the capsule. For a special occasion or just any dining experience, save some money and visit one of the many wonderful Celebrity Chef restaurants in Marina Bay Sands

We absolutely loved the Singapore Flyer Sky Dining experience. Lucky for us they were rehearsing for National Day so we had a spectacular view plus fireworks!You definately are paying for the view as the food was only basic a small seafood salad, soup, chicken/beef/fish and dessert, which was still quite nice. Drinks are an additional cost and are pricey.I would still reccommend the experience though

Whilst the dinner may seem a bit costly,. but you're on the flyer at night for two rotations (total of 1 hour) with a four course dinner. View - really great. Food - excellent. You're in a pod with up to four other couples. The seating arrangment is tailored to what is required. There was another couple the night we went and it was set up as 5 x 2 person tables. It masy seem a lot but it would still be an intimate dining experience. The only drawback is that alcohol is extremely expensive. Well wort

The views are stunning. The service was,to be fair very good. But the food is at very average. I agree with others who say just ride the Flyer and use the money to eat elsewhere.The price is far far too much for what you get. The cheapest bottle of wine to accompany the meal is S$120 (or about £60).Mushroom soup is hardly what I would expect during an £80/head four course dinner

This is without doubt the most we've ever paid for a meal, but the view made it quite worth it. Food was good also (4 course menu), we took one chicken and one vegetarian. You get to spend 1 hour (2 full revolutions), so there's enough time for dinner and some afterwards to admire the view. Lets you see Singapore like you've never seen before

Singapore flyer is nice experience for people that have not been in Singapore before. Wonderful view to the city and the sea. Marina Bay Sands next to the wheel is a great kombo. You can see straight to the sealing of it. Totally worth of visiting
