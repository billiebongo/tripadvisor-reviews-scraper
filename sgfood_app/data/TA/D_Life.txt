A small, cosy restaurant just located opposite of Beauty World Station Exit B. The place was very crowded during lunch time. And the speed that they serve food was quite slow. For peak hour, we waited at least half hour for the food to be served. The counter staff was unfriendly, and you were treated almost invisible when making payment. However, the rest of the staffs were considered approachable. The food was delicious and the portion was quite filling

This is a place that fills up fast in the evening. The food is very good and has tons of varieties to choose from - rice dishes, local fare and if you are like me who likes petai, you will be in heaven. The yam ring is really good. Not oily and very good portion. There are also western dishes that looks very good. A truly good find
