After traveling a long flight, I just wanted to relax and have a nice meal. I came across Ah Hoi’s Kitchen. Not fancy, but really tasty food. I had the stir fried prawn with leman sauce served over crispy noodle. Just a perfect simple dish.
3
Heard about the restaurant from friends years ago and decided to tried out but the food is so so and the service is really disappointing. I don't think I will go back ever again.
4
Food was overall better than average for the price paid. A lunch for 4 relatively big eaters plus drinks was only slightly more than 100 dollars.

Ah Hoi's kitchen was my go to restaurant when in the Tanglin area and needed a Chinese food fix. But my last visit was less than impressive. The satay sauce was a bit tasteless and the beef satay was full of gristle. The sweet and sour pork was full of fried strings of meat with only a few reasonably sized pieces. The sauce was bland. To add some veggies, I added broccoli with garlic. Again no flavour and the texture suggested the flowerettes had been boiled to a mush. I have had all 3 dished and enjoyed them in the past but not this time. Average at best. What have you done with your flavour

Having arrived late to the hotel we chose to have a meal on site. Big mistake, no wonder it's empty and we were the only ones in there. If you like fish and lots of ginger and spice it will suit you. We don't and it was the worse meal we have had in Singapore.Needs a revamped menue.Price was fair but choice is poor
2
Food was good and decently priced, especially when it’s located in town. It also has a nice open air atmosphere located beside the pool, with the recent cool weather in Singapore. But the waiting times for the food is too long. Tables that came after us were served first, and we had to ask the waiters and manager if they had forgotten our order. We were wondering whose food was sitting on the counter for about 5 minutes, and realised it was ours when they served us. It seems the restaurant was understaffed. Even though the restaurant was not even half full, it took about 30 minutes before our food came. Wouldn’t come back again.
3
Set at the side of the open air pool at Hotel Jen, the setting is lovely. The service is average as is the food. I ordered the chefs special starter and main course and both were just average. The starter was very greasy and the main course was ok but nothing special

新年明けの土曜、予約無しでしたが、18:30の開店と同時に入店。チリクラブは色は真っ赤でしたが、それほど辛くなく、カニはスリランカ産しかありませんでしたが身もシッカリあり、満足。前菜のセットと野菜の炒め物、チリクラブ用のパン3セットとビール2杯で140SGD。退店時も5割程度の混みでした。チリクラブは、ジャンボの方が旨味があって好みですが、ゆっくりと食べてるので、子連れの方にはこちらの方がゆっくり出来るかも。Saturday night, we got seat w/o booking. 75SGD for 1set of Chili Crab(you can order the way to cook the crab). Not too spicy and Sriracha’n crab meat is tasty. I like Jumbo seafood, but AhHoi is good for family coz cozy atmosphere.
2
Food was a shadow of what it used to be - flavorful and good value lunch sets with a spread of choice. Now, it’s one flavor profile: just salty from the soup to noodles and fried rice. If you need the sambal belachan (which was good) to help you get through the meal, you know there’s something sorely missing!
1
Went here on good recommendation. Ordered the chefs special entrees. They were so deep fried they were inedible. The service was slow and we thought we must be invisible even though there were not many in the restaurant. I did express my disappointment at the checkout but he wasn't interested.The ambience was interesting!! The very obese young man next table to us decided to divest his top and nobody said a word. Not goo

The food portions are quiet good compared to the cost for the food. THis restaurant is located at the inside the Jen tanglin hotel, the location is quiet nice as it is next to the pool.
4
We had a lovely catch up dinner with friends at Ah Hoi's with every meal we ordered spot on. Never been disappointed here. Love the deep fried buns that come out with the Chilli crab. Delish.
4
The crab is nice. The fish is fantastic fresh. The soup is OK only
. The restaurant is not air conditioning.
3
Had not been here for many years and it has lost its flare . Used to be packed with great atmosphere . It seems to have lost its appeal .
4
Our friend recommended this restaurant, especially for its chilli crab. We enjoyed the food very much. It was all very tasty and well cooked. Service was also excellent. If you want your starters served first , you need to be clear of that otherwise all your food will arrive together. Our only disappointment was that my husband did not get the chilli crab because you can only have a 1kg crab , which would have been too much for him. If you want the chilli crab you are better to go with a few others who you can share with.

We had a wonderful dinner at Ah Hoi's Kitchen on last week. It was a great treat and obviously the food was extremely delicious especially the Salted Egg Crab! To be more frank, I never tried salted egg before but an Indian staff (muthu, very attentive and friendly) suggested us to try. He said "try salted egg crab and you will ask for more!" Indeed!! Believe me, it was super delicious taste!! My plate was full of crab and prawn shells. We really enjoyed our dinner there!! All of us really satisfied with the food as well as the service (friendly staffs). Will be coming in again to try different food! Hungry go where??? Let's go to Ah Hoi's Kitchen!! 5 stars for this restaurant
5
Situated at the back of the hotel, in the same grounds overlooking the outdoor swimming pool, lovely restaurant, where you can either sit inside or out on the terrace, again friendly staff and my goodness decent food. wish we had a couple more meals there, it came to us fresh and also hot as in cooked heat, not spicy unless you asked for it. and definitely value for money Would I come in again to the restaurant? the answer is definitely YES ....Would I recommend this restaurant? YES Thank you guys definitely come in again when we are over again.
1
It was a famous restaurant once and thought we should give it a try.Ambiance was alfresco with fans and air cooler. If you are popular with mosquitoes, do come armed with a repellent. Ordered Tom yum soup and tasteless. Hot and spicy soup not too bad anyway it wonâ€™t go wrong. Starter and Satay were good. Chili crab sauce prawn, Kang gong vegetables were too saltish. Pei chai in oyster sauce was way to saltish too.Ordered fried spicy sea bass was totally disappointment. Burnt lemon and overly too much of sour prune gave it kind of funny taste.Not recommended if you have time to go for a better local restaurant.
5
We called in here for Friday night dinner and were very impressed. The crab, which is their specialty was outstanding. Lovely atmosphere near the pool, there are plants that provide privacy for diners at the restaurant as well as anyone using the pool. The staff were lovely and very helpful. Really enjoyed dinner here, our only surprise was it wasn't more crowded but we were there early in the evening. Put this on your list if you like sea food and cra

Normally when in Singapore I go to East Coast to enjoy my Black Pepper Crab. Now I have somewhere so much closer to the city and it is fabulous. Casual dining at it's very best. Highly recommended for a visit any time you are in Singapore 
5
paper wrapped chicken and satay yummy , so are the beef and seafood horfun, nice place for a simple lunch
3
One of the few restaurants that disinfect the baby chair for my gal proactively, much appreciated! Food was average (Claypot mee tai bah was pretty tasty though). Be warned that It can be pretty hot as there's no air conditioning.
4
The kampong set lunch is good and tasty, the value for the price is cheap and worth it. Great place for new stuff to try
4
Lovely setting on the terrace next to the pool. The prices were very affordable for a hotel and the varied Asian menu had something for everyone. Food was very tasty.
3
Pleasant and inexpensive lunch at tanglin area. The portion is good for one big eater. The achar wasn't fresh and they changed it.
3
One of our favorite seafood restaurant. We celebrated the Mother's Day lunch at Ah Hoi's and always an excellent experience. But I just want to share that the Chili crab taste has gone down. Chili crab is always the highlight of our meal but not this visit. Hope they can still cook the same old taste coz it's totally incomparable to other chili crabs in town
4
Ah Hoi's Kitchen is situated in Hotel Jen Tanglin (formerly known as Traders Hotel) is all about alfresco dining with authentic Singaporean flair. The interior is a large dining hall with vintage Asian furniture whereas the alfresco area offers poolside dining. Famous for its Singaporean and seafood dishes and many other classics, all the dishes that we tried were awesome such as Nasi padang , Ayam Penyet (Fried Chicken with Spices) , Tahu Telur (deep fried beancurd with egg), black pepper fried kway teow , Kaki Babi Masak Cuka Hitam (braised pork shank in black vinegar), and of course we had to try a crab dish which was Crab Bee Hoon, The meat of the crab are thick and filled the shell ,The superior stock was a little subtle but you can feel it absorbed in the bee hoon and cabbage. Excellent Crab Dish. All the meat and seafood that we tried were cooked to perfection. They are all tender, juicy and succulent The dining experiences I had at Ah Hoi's Kitchen was awesome.., although I must say it's a little pricey,. Overall, Ah Hoi are very creative with their new crab dishes. If crabs are not to your liking, make sure you try their BBQ selections. I truly enjoy it. A big plus for The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive
4
This seems to be a forgotten restaurant . We were one of the two occupied tables on a weekday night . The Poh Piah, satay and char kway teow were good . The Chili crab was huge but the Chili lacks punch . Service was good - you get the napkin for the crabs and an array of Chillis to choose from .What a pity - it's has a nice ambience by the poolside . If you have visitors craving for seafood but don't want to go to the crowded places at East Coast or Jumbo, this is not a bad option .
4
As part of the Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore this worked well for as rather late evening arrival and lunch. Situated on the fourth floor near the pool, gym and spa with outside views Ah Hoi's menu is large and varied with prices to suit all but the most stingy of budgets (given this is Singapore after all). Is is also only a brief walk from the Botanic Garden with free shuttle available to Tanglin shopping areas and the MRT NS22 stop (Orchard Road). The food is not likely to be the best of your entire trip, but enjoyable, plentiful and not your most expensive either. No hesitation to visit here in the future.
4
Good value food we had four mains and was suggest we also get a extra veg and rice to share, this wasn't necessary as the main meals were quite large. The Ah Hoi's Combi is a must. Not sure if desert is on the menu it wasn't offered in any case. Open plan dinning onto the hotel pool, didn't appear to have good air cond, but it wasn't hot that night either
1
I was not given the 10% CNY set lunch discount though it was stated in their website. And also state in my reservation through Chope
4
If you would like to go back to traditional Chinese style cooking with no frills, this is a place to dine. Its menu offerings consist of a good and decent seafood fired rice.
5
We dined at Ah Hoi's twice during our stay and enjoyed the food, particularly the wok fried vegetables (okra, petai, beans and eggplant) with dried shrimp and the kung po frog legs.
5
My wife has to have Gluten free food, the cheffs here double made sure all off my wife's food was Gluten free. The food is of excellent quality of a high standard with a great taste
3
Given the weather in Singapore, it would have been more conducive if they improve the air conditioning especially during lunch time. Food is not bad though.
3
Keep your expectations moderate when dining here. Meals served on time for a group gathering. Try their home made stuff.
5
A nice restaurant situated by the pool in Jen hotel the fresh fish and crabs are delicious well worth a visit by day or night
2
There is a fixed menu, which means you don't know what you're getting. Since our group was very diverse, not everyone could eat everything that was served. Additionally, we had specified that we had 2 people who were allergic to shellfish on the trip and one person who needed Halal preparation and they either didn't get the message or forgot to accommodate
4
It's a simple unassuming non aircon restaurant beside the pool at Hotel Jen Tanglin. We're not as convinced that food would be great as reviews of this restaurant had not been of best but nevertheless all else were fully booked for dinner hence we decided to give this kitchen a try.We ordered a few simple dishes - crispy baby squids, steamed groupa, tau foo dish, 3 egg spinach and eefu noodles.Despite the seemingly shorthanded waiters on hand, our orders were taken promptly and dishes arrived after a short wait.. piping hot.You can self serve yourself water and crackers from side table while waiting for your food.The dishes were pretty decent in taste and prices are good and value for money. Particularly liked the crispy baby squid and the steam fish. The fish was fresh and nicely steam to right texture.I do feel not enough credit is given to this kitchen and restaurant as their dishes were truly flavorful and yummy. Staff are not the best but are not rude. They were pretty prompt to serve and clear the dishes as we finish.I would return again for lunch or dinner soon as we did end up with a satisfying meal last Friday
3
I was here with a group of 12 with children -- I liked the settingThe food had good local flavor. But I found it pretty expensive for what we got.Service was slow but cos they were significantly understaffed (especially considering the price we paid). The service staff were pretty good
4
I find that the style of service and food are more like Indonesian. They serve free flow keropok / crackers with sambal.
We ordered kway tiaw, bun mantau with chili prawn, honey chicken and a coconut soup.
All except the coconut soup are nice.
5
Ah Hoi's is next to the pool area at Jen Tanglin, very nice to hang out in the evening for a laid back dinner. Food is fantastic and service the same.
5
We did not wish to go outside our comfortable Jen Hotel, and found great food pool side in a pleasant setting..but this was not just pool food...an excellent ala carte menu and the food delicious and well presented.
3
Overall food not too bad especially the salted egg yolk crab. But service was slow. Recommendations by restaurant staff were good, thus enjoyed the food.
3
The buffet here is good value for money. Cheap and lots of variety....
Recommended if you want to try many local dishes...
5
I have eaten here on several occasions sometimes with business guests and out near the pool is a very pleasant atmosphere.
4
We were staying at the Jen Tangling Hotel, and this restaurant is on the 4th floor next to the hotel's swimming pool. We thought it would be a typical expensive hotel restaurant, but we were wrong! This place offers good food at reasonable price!
5
We always visit Ah Hois Kitchen when we stop at Singapore and as usual we were not disappointed.The service was good and the food as usual was excellent. We shared the following. Chicken satay's, soft shell crab, ginger chicken, whole deep fried sea bass (which was so fresh), wok fried vegies and nasi goreng. We were happy to ring the bell on our way out
2
We have heard great things about this restaurant from many folks and had high expectations...maybe too high? It wasn't as good as it was said to be. We went for the Singapore chili crab amongst the other Singapore fair but although the food was OK...on a value for money and taste I would say find another place to get your chili crab because it is overpriced for quality and taste you get. Ambience however is good from its roof top location next to Hotel Jen pool area
5
We ate here one night and the sweet and sour pork was delicious! It's great to be out by the pool with a cold drink and yummy food
3
Large and unattractive as a place to eat. We were told that the food was excellent but each time we were told that there was a lengthy wait for a table so we went elsewhere..
4
There is a wide selection of Chinese cuisine and the best part is sitting outside with a pool view drinking a cold beer.
4
Was staying at a hotel down the road and happened to find this place by chance whilst in Tanglin Mall. Don't be put off by the fact that it's a hotel restaurant. If you are after some good 'home' cooked dishes with rice then try this place out. There's help yourself prawn crackers and iced water to get you started. All the dishes we ordered were excellent, especially the chicken satay. The bill was cheap too which was a surprise. Only downside is that it is open plan dining so without the aircon it can be a bit warm. Other than that good service and good food. Came on a Thursday night and it was half empty so food arrived quite quick.
5
True, good chinees cuisine. You will be able to see a lot of locals there which means that is is really good restaraunt. Good selection of real chineese dishes including seafood. Traditional round tables where you can move plates (again very traitional
3
Waited very Long, close to 45 mins, for food to be served. Self service for water and condiment. Food is of acceptable standard but definitely not for foodies. The restaurant is located next to the pool and on the roof TOP. It was very hot, open door concept, be prepared to perspire.
3
Tried their 12-12 menu for a family lunch on a Sunday. The service was cold - things get done but without any warmth. Robotic. The 12-for-12 menu was not bad - warm - and portions were generous. Unfortunately, the restaurant was HOT! As in the temperature. Ventilation was just inadequate. Dinner will likely be better
5
I hosted my daughter's birth announcement party for a 100 pax and booked the entire outdoor and indoor venue. The staff was absolutely fantastic! They catered to all my requirements and provided great service. Our guests loved the food and the experience. I would recommend the venue to anyone looking at hosting a family party or a corporate event.
5
We came in just as they were about to close the lunch hour but the staff was gracious enough to still serve us. The food is good but not too great and the service is great. Will recommen
4
Dinner here with a couple of friends on a Saturday evening, service was great, restaurant was busy and the food lovely. we had a selection of noodles, rice and finished off with their speciality of chilli crab. great value and a very enjoyable meal.
4
We stayed in the adjoining hotel and had dinner at this restaurant, food was beautiful and fresh and every meal was enjoyed! Staff were more than accommodating and helpful, especially being we were traveling with 2 infants! Thank you for such a wonderful night..
4
The atmosphere was so so, and most of the food are also maybe just above average, but I give it 4 stars because the char kway teow is really really good. Coming from a local used to paying 1/3 the price for char kway teow, that's saying something
3
I have stayed at the hotel for many years and finally tried the restaurant. My colleague and I had a sampler, with two different sides. The food was quite good. The service was nice. The price was quite reasonable as well. If there are not kids in the pool, the atmosphere is quite nice as the pool is a nice area. I would recommend eating at the restaurant
5
Walked in for a late lunch. Restaurant is on 4th floor of Jen Tanglin Hotel; indoors but poolside. Extensive local style menu. Staff very helpful. Food absolutely delicious. Large fish tank
3
We got a lunch there and although the food was acceptable, we didn't really find anything to write good comment about. The service the place, the food, the environnement, everything is just average, not bad but definitely not great neither. it is probably The kind of place you go when you are staying at Jen hotel and lazy to go somewhere else
3
Ordered their signature dish - crab but sadly to say it turned out spicy which we didn't expect so. Price is on high side but taste only averag
4
The Chinese food here is lovely and there is a good selection on the menu to suit western tastes but to also try something more authentic. The atmosphere is lovely as it's situated next to a hotel pool (which is not at all busy in the evening) and it is very well decorated with Chinese lanterns and fairy lights. A nice evening.
1
I ordered Beehoon with lobster and stir fried vegetables. I thought Beehoon is Rice vermicelli. I was served normal flour based spaghetti size noodles. I asked the waiter about it and I was told this is what they serve as Beehoon. Can you serve what ever you want under any name? I don't understand. Unacceptable for an expensive restaurant like this
4
I ate a couple of lunches here on my most recent visit to Singapore ~ it's attached to what was then Traders Hotel (now the Hotel Jen).Service was prompt and friendly, both inside and out on the terrace.The food, especially the chilli crab, was marvellous
5
Great poolside atmosphere, either indoor our out. Fresh seafood rivaling East Coast Park but so convenient within Jen Hotel. Simple local dishes, great value and friendly attentive service. About to be refurbished but I hope they keep the local atmosphere
1
My wife and I had two delightful meals here about 18 months ago. When we arrived in Singapore it was the first place we wanted to return to for dinner. What a mistake! The drinks were almost pure water (one lime juice; one margarita). Our entries were slow to arrive and consisted mostly of tough meat--chicken satay; then a prawn dish, etc. The hotel in which the restaurant is located changed hands; this may be the reason for the decline in the restaurant. But our waiter told us they just decided to become "more casual." Yu

妻と二人で、初めてAH HOI’S KITCHEN に行ってきました。 Regentに宿泊していたので近くにあるChilli Crabが食べられる店を探してGo.ガイドブックの地図を片手に探せど一向に見つからず、あまりの暑さにめげかけたその時HOTEL JEN の外壁にAH HOI’S の広告を発見。ホテルの名前違うじゃん。。。私のガイドブックにはTraders Hotel 内と書かれていますが、HOTEL JEN変わっていました。 旧Traders Hotelは知りませんが、HOTEL JEN はとてもきれいな内装です。エレベーターで４Ｆに上るとプールサイドの奥に目指すAH HOI’S はありました。 今回の目当てはChilli Crab ,。Chilli Crab は2種類あり,Sri-Lankan crab $72 ,Indonesian crab $32今回は豪勢にSri-Lankan crab　を注文しました。もう一品Lobster beehoon。 Finger bowl がtableに運ばれ、エプロンを巻いてもらいました。 beerを飲みながら待つこと10分。やってきました、赤い蟹。手をベトベトにしながら齧りつき、夫婦とも会話なく夢中に食しました。辛すぎないので、辛いのダメな人でもおいしくいただけると思います。辛しマーク1個です。付け合せの揚げパンも美味。ぜひご注文を。 Beefoonは日本で食べるものよりかなり太め。胡椒が効いたsoupとバクチーがバランスよくマッチしてこちらも美味しかったです。日本ではバクチーは苦手なのですが、この組み合わせは美味しかったです 場所はわかりづらいですが、orchard road沿いに歩いてTanglin Market Placeの裏手になります。暑さで体力が奪われていなければregentからめちゃ近いです。 Sri crab @$72.0Beefoon @$35.0Mantou @$1.0☓2Beer(Tiger) @$ 12.5×2Chinese Tea @$2.0 Service charge $13.6GST $10.45 Total amount $160.0
5
We eat here often as we enjoy the Tiki Hut style outdoor seating and the pepper crab is excellent at a great price. Lots of local style variety in the menu and specials on cold beer. Good location and great service always
4
This restaurant is in the Jen Hotel and can be relatively inaccessible. If you make it there, it's worth it. We were taken there by a local resident and we loved it. No lines, no tourists, but good honest food. Orders were taken quickly and the food arrived very quickly, yet freshly made. We had the black pepper crab which was good
4
As stated by other reviews the setting is very good. Pleasant staff and the food was good. Can't fault anything... Not exceptional so score is 4...But this is a good place and sensible prices too...
4
Lovely setting, with a friendly, informal atmosphere. The food was great and only on our last evening did things get a little ruffled: too many guests at one time with probably insufficient kitchen staff meant my husband enjoyed his starter whilst I waited for mine. This was bad enough, but my starter still hadn't arrived by the time his main course did. I could stand to miss a course or two, and a complimentary cocktail satisfied instead. The apologetic waiting staff would have won us back if this hadn't been our last evening at Hotel Jen. Prices not out of the way either
5
The food was tasty and served quickly. The prices were extremely affordable despite the 'real estate' it occupies. The variety of food on offer was great with the 'Sate's' taking pride of place. Connected to the Tanglin mall and the Hotel Jen makes it and ideal place to hang out in the evenings
3
She had a seafood combination which she found unpalatable and left most of it. I tried it and agreed. My meal however of crab meat & fried rice with crispy noodles was vet good indeed. The restaurant is conveniently located within the grounds of the Hotel Jen where we stayed and the pool-side setting was pleasant after a long flight from London. Priced @ $66 for two was OK, shame that my wife's meal was not up to scratch
3
Six of us decided to dine here and made a reservation through phone. When we reached there, the restaurant wasn't crowded and was less than half filled with guests. The food was satisfactory and tasty. Waiters are polite and helpful. The only down side was that we waited nearly an hour for our food to be served and this is despite the restaurant not having many guests at that time
5
I have been a long term visitor at Ah Hois...and on the last two occasions over 18 months, noticed the standard of both food and service had dropped. I have very happy to advise that whatever was happening...it has been rectified.My wife and I had Cod Fish (perfectly steamed with a delicate broth), Deep Fried Chicken with a warm lemon sauce (again the cooking was spot on, but the heated sauce made a lovely citric addition), Freshly made tofu with mushroom and kalian. (loved the tofu and mushrooms though not as impressed with he kalian which was a bit soggy). Excellent service and a fresh evening breeze made for an excellent meal

Ah Hoi's Kitchen is situated in Hotel Jen Tanglin (formerly known as "Traders Hotel"), and is famous for its Singaporean and seafood dishes. The interior is a large dining hall with vintage Asian furniture whereas the alfresco area offers poolside dining. Coupled with friendly service, how could one not enjoy their meals here? I knew not what to expect when I came for the lunchtime 12 For 12 Promotion - mainly featuring 12 nasi padang dishes for a mere SGD$12.00.The Ayam Penyet (Fried Chicken with Spices) - very crispy on the inside and tender on the inside. The golden crispy crumbs sprinkled over the chicken added to the crispiness and made the flavorful chicken even more so.I also tried the Tahu Telur (deep fried beancurd with egg), a deceptively simple dish with complex textures. The exterior is flaky with crisps; the interior was silken smooth with the tender beancurd and egg, so the texture contrast was simply awesome. The peanut sauce slowly led to spiciness through all the crisp and smooth softness; we could not stop eating this dish.Now, it is interesting to find Kaki Babi Masak Cuka Hitam (braised pork shank in black vinegar) at an eatery selling nasi padang, so this is a must-try. I enjoy braised pork shank usually, and must say that this is very succulent, checking all the right boxes for appearance, taste and texture.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/02/lunch-at-ah-hois-kitchen-hotel-jen.htm

Poolside menu is relatively cheap and plentiful - Satay is very good, avoid the club sandwich.
Main menu is Asian but the two Thai dishes ordered for lunch were very average.
4
Great Chinese food in an Al Fresco position at the Jen Hotel Orchard, positioned by the hotel swimming pool, great place for a well earned Tiger Beer with and nibbles and a comprehensive menu with efficient and attentiveness waiters & waitresses
4
Reserve a table for at ah hoi's kitchen before April 30 2015. We did and enjoyed a delicious nasi padang feast of twelve assorted dishes, as well as a complimentary drink,soup,and rice, for S$12 each. If you dine in a group, the 12th person eats for free.Delicious favourites like sour cabbage duck soup, curried chicken ,fried fish,jack fruit cooked in coconut milk kept us all happy. Ah Hoi is situated at the pool deck floor of the Hotel Jen. The retaurant is also well known for its chilli crab
4
Stop over in Singapore en route to Sydney. This is a restaurant beside the pool in the former Trader,s Hotel now Jen,A very varied menu at good prices. Food delivered quickly . Well cooked and presented. Friendly staf
4
attached to the Jen Hotel, by the pool, this is a convenient bar/ restaurant for residents at Jen. Service was good,food was excellent but drinks overpriced.
1
There is no choice for those who do not like seafood. My husband and I thought we would try the resturant as we were staying at the hotel. Epic fail as I don't like seafood and chicken skewers came out dry and with prawn crackers? Would never eat there again. You can't even get a glass of champagne only a bottle.Do not bother if you want decent food. Go to the food court at the mall (koren). Awesome food and only $7!
5
Ah Hoi's has an extensive menu, from chicken and pork dishes, to rice and noodles, and vegetarian dishes, as well as fresh fish and seafood you can personally select.In my four nights stay in December 2014, my wife and I sampled spicy chicken, garlic kai lang, sweet and sour pork, spare ribs, Hong Kong style steamed garoupa, and a few others (too many to mention!!). All were excellent, and the fish was so fresh and tasty it inspired me to review here on TripAdvisor - and I'm not really a fish eater!!The drinks selection (especially the beer choice) could do with a little expanding, but it's a Chinese restaurant so the focus is (rightly) on the food and the wine list is A-OK if you don't fancy a beer (the problem with the beers is one that's prevalent in the region - they're all of the plastic mass-produced tasteless variety: Tiger, Heineken, Sol, etc, which I will only drink if there's nothing else available).Having said that, I should emphasise that you'll be at Ah Hoi's for the excellent food, not the beer!!Sorry that I can't comment on the price aspect - it's a poor practice, but as I was staying at the hotel I just signed the bill to my room and paid no attention to it.Highly recommended!
4
We returned to Ah Hoi's Kitchen for lunch today with nostalgia. During the 1990's when I worked in Singapore this local restaurant at the (then) Traders Hotel/Tanglin Mall was one of my favourites.Today, we had stir-fried flat rice noodle with seafood (shrimps, fish and squid) and egg; stir-fried Kong Xin vegetable with preserved beancurd and chilli; stir-fried Sri Lankan mud crab with red curry; and one bottle of 700 ml S. Pellegrino. The bill came to around S$125.I must say we liked the food very much, delicious, full of flavour, and right to our taste. If I needed to criticise anything, It did take some time for the crab to be served which came after we finished the other dishes for a while.We also found the prices reasonable. Overall speaking, we were quite satisfied
2
1 starter delivered after 20 min wait, asked after another 10 mins as to where the other was, waited another 10mins for the next one, 1 main course delivered while still eating starter, 2 nd main course delivered 10 mins later, lamb chops are cold, we returned it, it was re delivered 10 mins later and was piping hot, however, half eaten lamb chop was still on the plate. Poor service, poor quality food, not worth it
2
My partner and myself are lover's of seafood so decided to try Ah Hoi's kitchen conveniently situated near the hotel Jen (But nothing to do with Hotel Jen I must add) The service was poor as the staff acted as if the restaurant was the local play ground at infant school...playing around chasing each other around the restaurant and out to the pool area where we were trying to have a romantic meal, I felt the meal was of average standard and over priced .
4
very romantic and relaxing.. and the seafood is nice.. try the special appetizer.. friendly and helpful waiters.
4
Love the mee tai muck, it's really yummy with the wok hei.
Fried kway teow with black paper was nice.
Had the chilli crab but taste was average,not fantastic though.
Lobster noodle was tasty. Fried eggplant was nice and crispy
4
It was such a nice experience during our business dinner in Singapore. The food was good, especially "a Jumbo Sri Lanka chilli crab", fresh and tasty!. restaurant atmosphere was good and relax. Service is ok :) Don't missed here!

Restaurant is on the 4th floor accessible through the Jen (former Traders Hotel) in Cuscaden. My friends and I (business visitors) enjoyed the local dishes. We had a feast at affordable prices. The menu offers a wide array of seafood, choices of meat dishes, noodles etc some in fusion others in very local styles. Dining is casual in a breezy environment with a choice of seating by the pool or in the restaurant. Offers a pleasant evening with friends.

This restaraunt is just below the room we had in the hotel. If you chose it you could pick your own fish or shellfish from the tank. Food does not come much fresher than this. Not the cheapest place to eat but then sometimes ambience and location dictate the price. m A comprehensive menu and service very satisfactory

The seafood here is very good and quite popular. On my second meal I tried the pork belly and I can really recommend that. It wasn't too fatty, just the right amount of fat in it and very tender. The vegetable stir fry with shrimp paste however, didn't really impress me. The combination of okra, eggplant and snake bean would have been enough. But the broad beans ruined it for me as they were bitter. I would suggest that they leave this out.

We were staying at Traders (could see our room across the pool) and chose Ah Hoi's because of the proximity for a reunion meal with Singaporean family at home on leave from their Beijing business base. The place wasn't crowded at lunchtime, despite the Traders coffee shop being booked out.In the inevitable battles of who foots the bill, this was the first time ever in Singapore that the Captain of Tables followed my pre-arranged demand that only my card be accepted.D and his family chose the food, including the crab special, and we all enjoyed it greatly.The service is efficient, and everything was served promptly.Be warned that Ah Hoi's interior section is not air conditioned, but we found it tolerable to be inside under a large ceiling fan. It proved to be a good choice for this occasion

It is one of the only restaurant in Singapore which offers a refreshing pool view which is really much appreciated.The food was just ok, I had a fried "Ho Fun"which was really soggy, could have been better, a bit more burnt in the wok.Service was alright, overall quite a nice experience

Went to Ah Hoi's Kitchen earlier this afternoon and asked if one needed the make a reservation to have a outside poolside table for evening dinner, answer was no, guess what? When we came back later in the evening it was full and only available outside table was in the walkway. When mentioning this to the waiter there was an apology and nothing more. We then got our menus and got ready to order. Whilst we waited two other tables in the restaurant where occupied by customers that came after us, they got service, we tried for about 20-25 mints to order without success.. So we left the place. The staff completely ignored us.Will not come back

When I travel to Singapore for work I always stay at the Trader's Hotel and enjoy Ah Hoi's several times during my trip. I love the pineapple fried rice and the chicken satay. Most recently I had a wonderful fish dish. Everything is always good and prepared fresh. It is poolside so you can even sit outside by the pool and have a leisurely meal in your bathing suit
