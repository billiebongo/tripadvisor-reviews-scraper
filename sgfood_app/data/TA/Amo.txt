A great place to come with friends: located in a hip area with bars nearby, very hip/sleek decor, attentive service. Amo has a pretty unique menu - the pizzas in particular. More of your upscale Italian but still with hearty portions, which I appreciate.

Good Italian seafood, including squid and octopus. The fried calamari are fresh, the genuine and tastes the real thing, no industrial fake products like the “rings” you will get in many places. Great hip ambiance. Very nice staff. Good to return to.
5
Service was excellent. Alex the sommelier was brilliant. Recommended a vino that matched what I liked.
The mushroom truffle pizza was fantastic. And so were the angus steak and the duck pasta. Brilliant. Highly recommends.

Very pleasant interior decoration with good food to match. Service was also very good.Good quality kitchen producing tasty and good sized portions of food. Sharing is quite acceptable.
5
Great ambience with great waiters always ready to tend to your needs. A little pricey but really fresh food with generous portions, truly Italian! Was also very thoughtful towards my anniversary, perfect! Thank you!

I visited Amo on a Friday for dinner with some friends and we love the casual vibe of the space. We had both the Bone Marrow Pizza and Roast Chicken which were delicious!
3
Nice ambience, excellent service but pushy. Kept asking whether we would like to order something and wanting to clear our plates. 3 of us shared an appetiser, pizza, main and 3 alcoholic drinks, and we only stayed 2 hours. They were pushy, in a friendly but insistent manner, with different wait staff coming over to keep checking on us. Spoiled the experience.

We had a night out with some friends and wanted to try out this fairly new place in Hong Kong street. It took a while to get the attention of a waiter but this got better during the evening.The waiter explained the menu, and we decided to share some starters and choose separate mains.We got some recommendations for starters to share, and this was not really dishes suitable for sharing. It all looked very messy trying to divide in 6 pieces. How do you divide 2 zucchini flowers on 6 people? Mains where good, and we had a lovely dessert. For being a Saturday night it was very quiet.

Held my mum's birthday lunch at Amo. Great service from Jody and his staff who were helpful throughout the organization process and on the day itself. Good food with good service. We had the family style menu and my family especially loved the burrata, lobster pasta, mushroom pizza, roast chicken and the chocolate torte. Thanks to the Amo team for making it a memorable occasion

Amo is a lovely restaurant offering a conducive space for intimate conversation over good food and wine. However, to retain clients requiring the privacy for conversation, it can consider finessing her service quality to be discreet, unobtrusive and non-condescending.
3
Was abit crowded as someone was having a party. Tried the cuttlefish pasta which was decent, could use abit more flavour
3
Ambience and service was good but food is average for the price. We ordered Burrata, Pizza, bread and cut fries for sharing.
3
Food is great. We had the grilled octopus, waygu beef and mushroom truffle pizza. All very tasty and yummy. Great recommendation by waiter. But it’s takes a while to get their attention for service from ordering, serving water and even refilling of our wine.
4
Service and ambience were good. The server was helpful and warm, taking the initiative for various things to make our visit as comfortable as possible. Food was also excellent, albeit a little salty. But that's something we can deal with. Beware, the portions are generous!
4
We came here for dinner, all 14 of us for a big family dinner. We had the pleasure of a semi-chambre separee, which was very nice. The overall setting is good, the service is friendly and attentive, and the super good! The pizza’s are real stone oven baked and to die for. We also enjoyed some really good calamares And buffallo mozzarella. The tiramisu, whilst visually exquisite, was a bit on the creamy side, but still very enjoyable. Gelato and Espresso was also a good combo!Recommendable!
5
My wife and I visited the restaurant on Christmas Eve and was served the festive menu. The pasta was freshly made and the crust of the pizza was really good. There’s also a nice al fresco area which looks really good.Will definitely be back there again

When you enter in this place you feel actually in Italy. Immediately I've recognized Italian staff and we've started to chat asking also for food suggestions. We had fiord Di zucchina filled with ricotta and ham, (how much I missed this plate), potatoes that looked fried but were baked, fried calamari, really delicious and a straciatella, prosciutto crudo and rocket pizza. What to say... Everything was so tasty and perfect that well.. Yes Italian food is number one, I can definitely say it... Especially if cooked by Italians. Thanks guys, I'll be back shortly!
5
We came here only a day after dining at Braci, so we had high expectations, and they surpassed them! For some reason, all the Italians working for chef Beppe de Vito are all from Puglia. Since my partner is also from there, they were super friendly to us!We ordered zucchini flowers, calamari, fries and a stracciatella + proscuitto pizza. All were so tasty!I highly recommend coming here for your casual Italian fix. I'll come here next time for dinner, then head to one of the amazing bars next door
3
Nice ambience , pizza taste good. Waiter is attentive. But the manager , keep on pressuring us to consume the food fast by asking to clear the table plates. In the end we called for bill, and went to another pub for drinks. Don’t think I will step in to this place again
4
Food was really good, I enjoyed all the pastas a lot, especially the beef shank. Reasonably priced, with a very different selection available from that of other Italian restaurants. Would highly recommend!
4
The pizza is one of the best i have tasted in Singapore. The service is also attentive. Good place for gathering.
4
Dinner is a little noisy with people coming in later and later. Overall a great dining experience and within walking distance from our office. Food is great too.
4
Waiter was attentive and atmosphere was pretty nice. Enjoyed the lobster pasta for two which felt like it could have fitted 3 pax as well as portions were pretty big.
4
Staff is friendly and professionnal,the restaurant is well decorated, tasty food, good pasta, good pizza. Wine menu is large,lot of choice.
4
Ambience is nice, mixing modern with a touch of old Singapore.The crispy calamari with the tomato dip is great, as is the signature pizza of Mushroom, Truffle, Mascarpone and Tuscan Pecorino.My son only likes tomato-based pasta which was not on the menu, but the waiter kindly suggested a pomodoro for him. We also order the linguine with Clams, Paprika and Cherry Tomatoes, and Tagliatelle with Beef Shank, Mushrooms & Orange Salmoriglio. In general, I find the pasta too firm, but the taste for the linguini was good. The Tagliatelle was not really to my liking however (feels a bit too creamy).For dessert, we ordered Chocolate Tarte with Green Tea and Yuzu Meringue and the Yuzu meringue added a nice sour twist to a sweet chocolate cake.The waiter was attentive and helpful, but the table was a little small and couldn't fit our orders. The manager was also a little snobbish from the way he looked at us and tried to guide us how to consume the food and use the plates - and the reason we couldn't do it properly was that there was insufficient space on the table to place the plates in the first place

Nice decor and atmosphere . Service was attentive . We have burrata which was nicely creamous , pork ravioli and octopus . Pork ravioli didn t impresss by the texture . Octopus is very small piece with nothing really special . Wine list is absolutely overpriced . Starting from 70 Sgd for a very basic Italian wine with an average of SGD 130 - 150 for a bottle cost 8-15 euro in Italy . Not a Barolo below 200 Sgd where event in fine italian dining like senso , you get some for 130 Sgd . We end up with 230 sgd bill for a poor wine , 4 raviolis , a piece of octopus and a bit of mozzarella . Amo intend to be casual dining with price matching italian fine dining . And food is actually not that casual . I believe we will come back for the nice atmosphere and try the pizzas who looks absolutely gorgeous .

The wait staff was extremely helpful and friendly - enjoyed the whole dining experience. Crispy calamari was the classic, with a lovely dip. The zucchini flower starter was so delicious, the mixture of flavours complemented so seamlessly- creamy with the crunch of pistachios. The black cod was done to the right tenderness and moisture- the cioppino and fregula were so tasty- not too “tomatoe”. Unfortunately we did not fancy the hazelnut and corn cake dessert.
5
upon entering Amò i am in love with the restaurant deco right at the doorstep ,balances modern-stylish with old-school style.The signature pizza of Mushroom, Truffle, Mascarpone and Tuscan Pecorino was delicious.Deliciously-thin, doughy pizza base with just some crunch on the side. pizzas at Amò are pre-sliced, and each piece is individually garnished with an equal amount of toppingsThe texture was lovely, truffle fragrant, and toppings flavorful.Fall in love with this place.A good place to chill after wor
4
We had a nice trip to Amo off the very vibrant Clarke Quay. We both had good starters a calamari in nice batter with tomato aioli plus tuna bruschetta and the;shared a specialty pizza....there was plenty and chocolate torte and sorbet ( mango and lime ) finished off a €160 dinner. Not bad value but only washed down with Peroni and water as the wine is too expensive with the Singapore taxes - but there is a good wine list here
4
New establishment with great Italian pizza and pasta and grilled fish! Service was great with waiter recommending Veltallina red wine!
4
Pink Cocktail not to my liking tasted like cough syrup. Pesto garlic was a bit overpowering for the bone marrow pizza. Truffle pizza and zucchini flowers were the bomb
4
Had the calamari which is one of the signatures. Was quite good, though the batter was abit wet. Truffle mushroom pizza was great as usual
5
Food was superb, service excellent and love the ambience. Cozy enough for catch up with friends or date night. Pizza is a must try and the Boston lobster pasta...and of course you need to save some space to check out the tiramisu!
4
Awesome place, great ambience! Food was really good n to TOP it all, we were very happy with the service the staff provided. Definitely will be back again👍
4
We had our business lunch here. The staff was pleasant and accommodating and the food was fantastic!
5
Dined here with a group of 8 colleagues for a business dinner. This restaurant is one of its kind, great atmosphere with very attentive staff, authentic food but most importantly a great wine list.We all really enjoyed the eveningI would most definitely recommend Amo
5
Been meaning to go here for months its in the same street as my office! Set up a work lunch and OMG what a surprise. Great muted decor entrance via a well appointed bar. Nice sensible dining chairs. Good service too.Started with a Negroni... First rate. There is a fixed price lunch menu and what looks like a superb pizza menu. The food I would say is a modern take on classic Italian nothing too silly just refined. My calamari and tomato salad both superb. All up a great find. Ill be back.. And have been.

A group of 7 of us were here for my husband's birthday. We had the Sharing Menu (Family style) which comprised of a pizza, 2 appetisers, pasta, 2 mains, 2 sides, 3 desserts and tea/coffee. We were able to try their signature dishes through this menu that included the Burrata, Crispy Calamari, Caserecce, Mushroom Pizza, Grilled Octopus, Pork Neck etc. I would recommend the family style menu for a group of 6 or more given there is quite alot of food to try. The whole group really had a good time, service was great and the food was delicious (there was enough variety for our friend who doesnt eat seafood). Very enjoyable night, will definitely come back again

I went to Amo for a dinner with friends. Service was good, very quick and friendly which you don't always see in Singapore. However, the food was much below average. We had burrata, tuna tartare and beef tartare for starters. Burrata was strangely "disasembled" on the plate which took out all the magic of creamy inside with mozarella skin. I had to look for the tuna in my dish. For mains we took the mushroom pizza and mushroom ravioli. Ravioli was good. Pizza not so much. It was overflowing with mushrooms and there was barely any cheese which for ne is the basis of any pizza. The dough was very soggy. Desserts were our highlight. We had tiramisu and apple strudel. Portions were huge and both were delicious. I'll go back just for drinks and desserts.
4
Went with Friend and had dinner. Nice atmosphere. Varied and interesting food. Had good starters, amazing beef knuckle pasta. Nice Chanti.
Great location and friendly staff not in your face.
4
It's my 2nd visit in a month and love the food. Mushroom truffle pizza was a two times order, and I'm looking forward to try the lobster pasta!
3
Had the business set lunch. Good overall, but the previous caramelised banana dessert was better. Pizza to share was good
4
Easy casual ambience with friendly service. Good pizzas and starters. Truffle mushroom pizza a real star. Decent house pour on the white wine and a delicious whiskey sour. Uni pasta-special a little heavy and a tad expensive but freshness of uni made it worthwhile.
4
Love the interior — classy and cosy with dim lighting and interesting decor. Dishes are interesting takes on italian cuisine. Appetizers tasted a little weird, but the pizzas and mains were delicious! Service was great, staff were friendly.
5
The whole concept is different . Starting form the techno music playing on the background, to the menu and layout .Best pizza I ever try ( at least my taste ) . All dishes are different and you can feel the quality of ingredients . definitely different concept from any other comercial Italian .I got good recommendation on the wine and food from service staff . Price I find it reasonable Definitely I’ll be back
3
Had pizza, grilled beef, black cod and the calamari. Food is reasonably good and the pizza is good.The beef i had was good as was the cod that my wife had.The service standards by the stewards/servers leaves a lot to be desired.The italian hospitality is definitely lacking and as such, makes the dining experience to be memorable for the wrong reasons
5
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Amò when we were there to celebrate a friend’s birthday. It is conveniently located at Hongkong street, there’s a bar area at the entrance, an open kitchen with a giant wood pizza oven, cosy interiors and a gorgeous alfresco patio. The server showed us to the outdoor courtyard, and boy was it a charming space with beautiful wall paintings! Food wise, we ordered a delicious prosciutto and stracciatella pizza with a chewy and crispy pizza crust, a cod fish pizza that was a special of the week, a squid ink pasta that was so good it was gone in a matter of minutes and a nicely done Angus beef. Overall, we found the food at Amò to be hearty and filling and would personally recommend getting a table at the outdoor area or book the private dining room if you have a bigger group
3
Ordered Cod Fish which comes with Fregola which is quite interesting but I felt abit salty. The Kurobuta Pork Ravoli, I don like the texture and can't taste the truffle. Hand cut fries was soft and soggy not the kind I like. Overall atmosphere was nice and classy. But tables are too close, no privacy
4
Food was very good. Portion huge recommend to share a main course if you ordering starters. Suits family it will be good if they open on Sunday. Except the staff is a bit blur got our orders wrongly and not professional enough to suggest us to us about the portion size. But I will still be back and must have their truffle pizza
5
great food, attentive service, good wine list and portions were big enough for two people. All good!
5
One of the best Italian meals I've had in Singapore. The cocktails, ambience and service were great too. Will definitely be back!
5
Service was warm and attentive; felt extremely welcome. Glad it wasn't stuffy and snobby! Food fared well too, but wished the pizza crust was crispier.
4
Had both the truffle mushroom and the bone marrow. The former was fantastic. The latter was good, but had abit too much pesto
4
The first time i went there i actually asked for a seat inside the restaurant but when i arrived I was told that i had a table outside. I was a bit pissed about it but i was showed the rear outdoor area to have my dinner. It was a blessing in disguise cause i was totally taken aback by the decor which was so green and clean.it was not hot at all and in fact quite cool and so cosy. Sitting there with friends , talking , laughing, having some nice Lobster pasta with wine was a very pleasurable evening for me

Wrote to Amò’ to arrange dinner for my leadership team, they were really prompt in email response and were really kind to customize a set dinner for my colleague who has special dietary:Gluten free, only eats seafood (no meat), allergic to chocolate. As a organizer, this means alot to me!We took the 4 courses set menu at $68++pp, which comes with Choice of 2 appetizers, a Pasta, a Choice fish or meat, a Dessert as well as Tea / coffee. The food was decent, decent as in good. The one dish that left a smile on our faces was the Panna Cotta with Apple Compote! Thumbs up! we were even talking about it the very next day. The ambience was right, the servers were great, nothing to complain about the food. This is one place that will not go wrong
3
We ordered bone marrow with pesto pizza and mushroom with truffle pizza. The pizzas were above average but not great. We also got the cold cuts and cheese platter, and tomato salad which were just ok. The service was alright. The restaurant was in a neighborhood with a lot of dining and drinking establishments. It was popular on a weekend night and reservations are recommended

If you're a pizza lover on the lookout for something special that has updated your favourite humble italian dish, Amo might just be a great choice for the evening.Amidst the decidedly hip neighbourhood of Hong Kong Street where one used to find traders of spices and grain, Amo finds itself in the good company of other well established in trend restaurants such as the acclaimed FOC tapas bar up the street.The pizza here is special that's for sure. With flavours like bone marrow and pesto with raddichio, you're bound to find something you've never tried elsewhere. The chefs in the open kitchen do as good a job with the plating as they do with the cooking so this is definitely a fine choice to impress a date or a group of friends if you're don't want to appear like you're trying too hard yet want to make a statement but in a trendy casual environment
5
You guys nailed it. Super tasty pizza, perfect pasta, tip top service and beautiful venue. What a lovely dining experience.No doubt one of the best Italian meals we've had. We had silent moments to savour every distinct flavour and intricate textures of the freshly knead dough, which produced an authentic wood-fire oven pizza. Wow-factor 10/10.We want to be back tomorrow and everyday
5
The family went to try Amo on a Friday evening. Home made pasta and freshly baked pizza were truly the star that was ably supported by the sauces. We shared the lobster pasta (good enough for the 4 of us). The octopus was tender and very tasty. And finally had the truffle mushroom pizza! The dinner was made more enjoyable by our Italian server who is one of the friendliest server in SG. He had great recommendation for wind and dessert
