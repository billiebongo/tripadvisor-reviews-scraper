This is an interesting combination of a mini art gallery and caf√©/coffee shop. The artworks on display are special and contributes to the atmosphere of the establishment. The service is efficient and both the coffee and ice cream are awesome.

Nice bingsu. Nice sweet potato ice bingsu dessert but we where there wanted to celebrate a birthday with a cake, they don't allow us to cut our cake. Mmm... Tables are limited.
Still yet to try a really really authentic and nice bingsu.

located at the heart of Chinatown, comes a funky little Korean cafe that serves Bingsu ( Korean shave ice ) , beer and the usual tea and coffee.Bingsu portion is reasonable but prices can be a little steep, but the taste makes up for it! If you spend more then 40 bucks in a single receipt, you are entitled to........bring home a flower vase?!?! Kinda surprised by their offer but still, i had a good laugh with the staff.staff are generally well mannered and took time to explain to us various bingsu, their combination and their popular specialty. a pity i couldn't try their milk tea bingsu because if was sold out on a Friday night.overall, a decent place but they can consider serving plain water as the bingsu can be sweet. just a suggestion

If you're looking for an ultra-sweet, milky dessert, look no more than Cafe Insa-Dong. It's a great treat for kids, but parents, be prepared to deal with the results of a majo sugar-overload. It was much too sweet and milky for my liking, but worth trying if you're curious about what bingsu is. Tip: The servings are large. One order can easily be shared amongst 3 adults. Extra tip: the ceramics that decorate the interior are free with a purchase of bingsu

The waitress was more interested to promote her special offer than to take the order properly. Eventually missed out our order for a latte. There was a lot of effort put in to ensure the shaved ice was well-done. However, I thought the price is rather steep. They sell some art and paintings and pottery in the store. Finally nothing too much to crow about with regard to the decor. No loss not visiting

We decided to have coffee in here impulsively because we saw the place looks lovely. I had a lava cake which was good and a moccachino which was also good. Many young people come here to hang out with friends. It is a nice beautifully decorated place.

The bingsu here are affordable and not too bad but I expected more ingredients thus the phrase- you pay for what you get. Try their sweet potato ones if you have the chance. The Injeolmi toast is not bad too (chewy and addictive but a little sweet)

Interesting cafe space with artworks and decorative installation pieces for sale. Love the sweet potato latte. The bigsu was good but will be more adventurous with other flavours on next visit. Their seems confusing as to how one is supposed to make a selection. Not only do you select the overall flavour of the dessert but the shaved ice cream flavour itself also can be changed

As a cafe go-er, I had been to numerous cafes in Singapore but Cafe Insadong is the only one which has provided the most unique yet delicious food for the tea time. The toast, totally out of my expectation. It was well toasted with added some beef bulgogi and kimchi at the top. The surprising part, there were some korean rice cake spread in the middle. For hot beverage choices: nearly each of them looks so interesting, I wanted to try all of them but ordered the Sweet Potato Latte instead. Seriously Sweet Potato for a drink? Turned out it was a well made and yummy drink.Highly recommended for something different. However I must say the Bulgogi rice was so so. The rest, especially those look special to you. Go for it!Last note: the staffs were quite friendly as well. The cafe was surrounded by some art works, looks like they were for sales too

Good service with generous portion. Best Korean food stands out from plenty of Korean food surrounding this area. Menu was great choices and by having dining in, you definitely feel like in Seoul. Staff were friendly and very helpful and attentively making sure all guest were well served
