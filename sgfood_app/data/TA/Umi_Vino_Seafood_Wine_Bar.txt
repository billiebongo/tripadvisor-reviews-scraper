Went there for their in house one for one promotion on main course and steaks. Love the wagyu burger! Steak had the tendons, so wasnâ€™t that nice to chew on.
4
Food was good n fresh.
Should consider having placemats and improve service.
Will come back for more.
5
Great ambience, great service and delicious food. The place is not very easy to locate though. But it is indeed a hidden gem.
4
Came here because we had a voucher, and the food didn't disappoint. Good fresh seafood, and good service too.
5
Went for the lunch special and had their truffle soup, duck confit and a piece of cake for $26.90++. Food is good, service is good.
4
Good deal at 1 for 1 main! Prefer their 1) lobster, prawn & scallop burger 2) blue swimmer crab + tomato cream and 3) Hokkaido Scallop + konbu
3
Food was fresh. Waiter was patient to explain to us different types of cooking which we can choose from. However was not prompt to top up our water when ours were near to empty. Don't think will visit again as there is nothing worth going back
4
It was the 2nd day of the Chinese New Year and not many places were open for business. However, at this end of Marina Square, where there is a collection of Japanese eateries, they were all open.We were drawn by the lunch set, soup, main and dessert for $26++. It was good value and the food was good. What also surprised us was the size of the dessert. We were expecting the cake to be maybe 4 x 3 cm, you know, some token size as part of a set, but it was a normal portion of around say 6 x 6 cm.We didn't try the ala carte but we all had a satisfying lunch. Service was fine
3
When we stepped into the restaurant, we had to wait for quite a while as there was no one at the door to guide us into the restaurant. in the end, we "self-serviced", went into the restaurant and get a seat ourselves. It was then someone noticed us. Food wise, it serves fusion cuisines and I had a scallop pasta and it was delicious. I also had a grilled cod side dish. The cod was done to perfection, however, the price was exorbitant. I would give this place a four star if not for the initial mediocre service I received
3
For what it is (part of Japanese food store) it is quite overpriced. We tried several dishes, including crab legs, tom yam king prawns, grilled squid and grilled asparagus - all reasonably well made, but check with 2 glasses of wine came out at SGD 120 which is quite expensive for a foodcourt type eatery
5
Went there on a weekday evening. Restaurant was a little quiet at first but the crowd started coming in a little later. Food was great and service was impeccable.
4
The wagyu beef burger and duck confit was good. Ambience was nice and quiet and waiter was attentive to what diners need. Recommended restaurant.
4
Restaurant was quite empty on a weekday night. Went with chope 1-for-1 so it was not pricey but the portion of duck confit was quite small and not filling - the burger seems like a much better choice.
3
Service charge is charged before discount so do take note. On the good side free cakes are offered for each pair of main dish ordered so it does offset this amount. The food i fine, but a little dry for my taste.
4
We had the angel hair pasta, beef cheeks, lobster burger, mussels to share, and drinks, quality of food was pretty decent though the beer had a hint of sourness. Total bill for 3 came up to $170 thereabouts. Pretty okay.
1
We chose the restaurant as they were running a one for one main. Given the central location, I picked the place to try since their menu looks decent too. Sadly, the price of food does not justify the food presentation, taste and portion. The crabmeat pasta at $29, portion was so small it shocked me. I doubt a 8 year old will feel filling eating it. I will never patronize the place again
3
Food is so-so, we've had better ones for the same price. Service and atmosphere are average also. What we were not very happy was that we were there for Chope's one-for-one offer but they only restrict the offer to the cheaper dishes; the more expensive dishes were "not available"
4
The food is good and value for money since I used the 1 for 1 mains/steak chope promotion. The beef was really tender but my partner and I find that the sauce is a little too sweet for our liking. Not much people in the restaurant on a Monday evening, thus good and quiet ambience for a relaxing dining experience
4
The focus of Uni+Vin is their seafood so I recommend that you either.order from their seafood bar or any of the dishes featuring seafood. Their scallop and lobster burger is good if you like the texture of Japanese fishcake. The lobster and crab bisque was hearty and their crabcakes are paired beautifully with a mango salsa. I also enjoyed their scallop and konbu spaghetti. If you get the chance, also give their sake martinis a try
5
The 8hrs braised beef cheek was the best, let alone the peaceful atmosphere of the restaurant. Tried the live little neck clams with white wine broth as of what the waitress recommended and it was really a wise choice for me. The staffs are friendly and take the effort to go beyond in assisting the us. Thank you for creating such a beautiful experience for me
4
Restaurant ambience is good. Service was fine but food need some improvement. Taken the cold noodle with scallop, but doesn't taste good in their sauce. Food taste need improvement.
5
Tried their lobster scallop prawn burger using their signature card deal. Nice! Saw a video showing they use only prawn meat for their patty. Fries were great! Salad was fresh! Bun was soft and delicious. Love this meal!
3
Expected more from this place based on the review. Ordered all the recommended items but felt they were all bland tasting. Seafood was not the best
3
Overall, a rather pleasant experience dining at Umi+Vino! The lobster was grilled to perfection and tasty as promised. However, the food did not deliver in terms of value as the pasta as overcooked and mushy.
2
Tried the blue swimmer crab pasta (tomato base). Sauce and pasta was nice but I had real difficulty finding any crab in the dish. Maybe I should have sent the dish back to the kitchen....
Quite disappointing, should have chosen the scallop pasta instead!
5
Great food and ambience. The angel hair pasta dishes are must-try! Hop over to sake bar next door to complete your night out!
4
~Emporium Shokuhin is staying put for now but the range of Japanese choices is quite extensive so you'll be spoilt for choice, by far the location has the best view outside~last 2016Aug I was here with my wife for lunch and 2017Sep with a business partner for dinner~service is attentive although we still have folks who lack knowledge of their own menuLobster Prawn & Scallop Burger - certainly can tell why it's easily in the Top #10, delicious seasoned bun, all the seafood just right YUMz x2Deep Fried Silver Bait - a bit on the smaller side but passable compared to othersWagyu Boneless Short Ribs - WOW meat slides off YUMz x3definitely a goo place for lunch & dinne
4
I have been having lunches here for several times as I particularly like their pasta as well as the airy and cheerful ambience. This time, we opted for the SET LUNCH - Slow Roast Boneless Wagyy Short Rib (+$4) with fries & bbq sauce and the Blue Swimmer Crab Pasta (+$4) with asparagus & creamy tomato sauce; mushroom soup and Umi Salad (+$4).The mushroom soup and salad as appetiser set out the postive tone for the main course. The wagyu beef was tender as it had been slowed cooked. We liked it. However, the pasta was a disappointment - over cooked. I thought the chilli crab sauce would be a better combi with the pasta than the tomato sauce. The selection of Japanese cakes from their Patisserie make it up for the disappointed pasta. Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience here at Umi + Vino except that the serving service was just too quick between each course. Expect to pay more than the set lunch cost if you were to include salad, coffee as well as other add on
4
My husband and I had the wagyu beef burger and the lobster scallop burger for dinner last week. The beef patty / lobster was tasty but not particularly memorable. Surprisingly, it was the charcoal bun that came with the burger left a greater impression on the both of us. Its still a nice place to visit and i would recommend couples/ families to
5
My family and I celebrated my wife's birthday at the UMI + VINO Seafood Winebar. We started with the Fresh French Oysters, Tapas Foie Gras and Boston Lobster Grill, which were all mouthwatering. Our main courses of Silver Cod Fish, Australian Wagyu Ribeye Steak and Angel Hair with Scallop were simply delicious. We were, however, not impressed with the Duck Leg Confit, which was too dry for our liking. For dessert, the Macha and Black Forest cakes were a great way to end a good meal. Special mention to our server, Miss Anda, who was exceptionally attentive. Thank you for making this an even more special and memorable evening
5
Overall very good experience with very fresh seafood and the service was good. The price was slightly steep though.
5
Good food ,good services,good environment.
Must try the food there very tasty and fresh.
Tks for crew services and the chef.
4
Food was delicious. Delicate flavours beautifully cooked.
Portions are on the small side. Impeccable service
4
Visited the restaurant using chope promotion. A little tough to locate - new area within MSQ. The restaurant is pretty quiet for Saturday afternoon but comfortable with good service.
Food is alright, lobster and asparagus were well cooked.
5
Ordered a steak and half lobster. Service was quick/good as less than half the restaurant was filled. Apparently this restaurant has been around for awhile. Would not have stumbled upon this place if not for a promotion.
5
I had the beef stew with mash while my partner had the half lobster
The beef stew is fantastic! A must-try
The half lobster was delicious, but the portion was really small
4
Brought the family there for the first time under the Chope Birthday Thrills $1 Special on their half lobster. Of the 3 mains we had, the $1 half lobster dish turned out to be the best! I am impressed that they didn't stinge on the amount due to the price! However the size portion for my Norwegian salmon main was a little on the small side. So we left the restaurant still feeling hungry! Nevertheless, the food was delicious and well presented. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her angel hair with Beef stew. I could have given them 5 stars if not for the smaller portion size
4
A few old friends decided to gather here for a quick drink prior to dinner. Prices of beer during happy hour are reasonable with a relatively good selection. Bites offered were of good quality though it tend to be on a sweet side. Overall, a nice pit stop prior to dinner or other activity in the mall.
4
I was invited to this Japanese restaurant for a corporate dinner.The place can fit 60pax. Food over there was good! Seafood was nicely served and I loves their ramen. The ramen soup was so good!If you loves alcohol, they serves a wide range of sake, beer. And they go well with food they offer. Location is easy to find, staffs and chefs are friendly. Service is good. Price on menu is on the high side, normally spend around SGD 80per pax. Good place for small celebration.
4
The seafood is very fresh. I had a flamed salmon sushi salad. The greens & salmon are both very fresh. The salad is very flavorful. The dips for the clam on ice is very tasty. The cold scallop pasta is quite unique, the noodle is similar to the thin noodle used in fishball noodle...but overall it blended well. The food are more fusion. The alcoholic drinks are on the high side. And they charge 50 cents for ice and warm water!
3
Sirloin steak was good but Wagyu beef steak was so-so. The waitress got our steaks, well done & medium mixed up.
3
Went there for a work lunch with colleagues. Convenient as walking distance from our office. Food was not tasty for everyone. Pasta was too dry. Deserts were basic tasting. Overall, the lunch set is affordable.
5
Service was excellent and food quality is great as well. But price is on the high side. However with the service and food quality, I think it's worth the price
4
Restaurant's decor is contemporary. Its openness and high ceilings provide a casual ambience. High counter seats have a view of raw seafood displayed on the counter as well as of staff working behind the counter. We chose the regular table seating as it provided us with a good view of the entire restaurant.The menu features the fresh seafood and meats also sold at Emporium Shokuhin. We ordered Alaskan King Crab Leg and Grilled Whole Boston Lobster along with Umi Salad and Thickcut Fries. Both items were as fresh as live seafood should be. They were well prepared and delicious. Our dinner was paired with Ferrari white wine from Italy.Prices were high but can be considered as reasonable for the freshness of seafood
4
Good array of fresh seafood offered. Had oysters which were delicious, though a tad pricey at $8 each. The grilled squid was very good, done tender and tasty, just like the wagyu ribeye steak. Expected the Boston Clam Chowder to be thick and chunky, but it was dliluted cream, though it came with generous amount of clams with shell. Lobster bisque was slightly less diluted, but a bit bitter in taste. We enjoyed the crab cakes which were perfectly done, with chunks of crab meat. The LIttle Neck Clams in White Wine broth was ok, though a bit rubbery and sandy. Service was very good and that made up for a couple of misses
4
We only had seafood. They were all very, very fresh. The scallops and lobster stood out for us. They were tastefully prepared and went well with the wine we had. Desserts were nice too. The service was excellent. Staff were very attentive. Ambiance was relaxing. This was an enjoyable lunch
4
When I arrived at 8pm, I was brought to my table without much waiting and after awhile, the server came to take my orders.The drinks came pretty fast.Seafood tasted good and fresh. However, the steak tasted a little stale.Dessert was great too.Staffs work quickly and you do not need to wait too long in between dishes. Generally, I will return to this restaurant and try their other seafood dishes.
5
Visited on a friday night, not very crowded. Tried the lobster scallop burger, they included a whole lobster claw placed above the seafood patty. The yellowtail and prawn ceviche was very fresh and well made.Service however, was lacking much, the waitresses were not very friendly and could not clearly explain the menu
2
We ordered 6 oysters, and then the mussels and the clams with a bottle of Italian white wine. The oysters were good. But both the mussels and the clams were utterly tasteless and swimming in a very watery, equally tasteless broth. I sent back the mussels as inedible and changed it for the fried squid, which was acceptable. My wife half-finished her tasteless clams and ordered the fried prawns, which were average. Prices are low and so is the quality. There are many other, far better Japanese "live seafood" restaurants. I had to ask to tone down the loud, thumping music (techno-rock, nothing Japanese), further adding to a bad eating experience. Never again
5
A friend recommended this place as I was looking for a nice place for a birthday dinner that has nice ambience but not too pricy. There were only two ladies.. and we kinda ordered too much; one dish less would have been good. We ordered: lobster bisque (too thick for my liking, but other people may enjoy it), baked sea bream puff pastry pie (nice portion for sharing between two people), Hokkaido scallop sashimi + konbu pasta (if you order cold, the scallop would be sashimi style, if you order hot, the scallop would be nicely seared). we ordered the hot version for the scallop konbu pasta.. that was the best dish. there was also a promotion with UOB whereby if you order above SGD100, you can select a free small appetiser - we chose the wagyu burger. Delicious!Price of mains ranged from SGD22-48, averaging about mid 20s. Definitely recommend this place. Oh, and this place is located at Emporium Shokuhin, outside the supermarket itself, as you come down the escalator/ Emporium entrance. They are actually famous for their live seafood.. but it was above my budget for the dinner
5
Great food for a Long day at work. Currently they are having a happy hour promo Hoong at $4.90++ for a pint of draft beer. The lobster was good and also a good place to relax and unwind!
4
I stopped here for a few oysters before lunch and boy am I glad I did. They had a tricky happy hour. They advertise $1 oysters buts that's only after you buy a half dozen at regular price. I had oysters from France and Ireland a regional first for me but they were so good. I could have stayed there all day. The rest of the menu looked pretty good but I only had oysters and a saki lychee martini so I can't really give an opinion on anything else. The restaurant had a clean, open and inviting feel. The stay was nice and attentive but still gave you your space. This place is inside of a building kind of like a mall but not exactly. It might be a little hard to find but totally worth the effort.
4
I had a quiet solo lunch after running errands in Marina Sq mall, but it was so lovely! The set lunch deal ( choice of soup, main and dessert for 26++ ) was surprisingly available on weekends as well! I liked my choice of main wagyu steak and wine reduction combination! I felt that it was value for money and would like to visit again for more! But maybe I could choose my own dessert instead. the waiter just gave me carrot cake by default. Quite sure the menu says I can pick my own dessert. Good location and good lunch set deal
5
This restaurant is quite new and we were attracted by the price of the beer. Looking at menu we decided we had to come back to eat a late lunch. The food was excellent and paying the extra $8 for the Wagyu beef was well worth it. So good we came back two weeks later to have the same meal again
3
After spending some time at GYU, we decided to use our $20 discount voucher and went to UMI. We were not hungry so didn't try other restaurants. I like the Wagyu beef. Ordered the lobster bisque but sold out. We ordered the crab cake but it's a let down. More crunch than crab. Is it salmon or tuna filling than crab. The Wagyu beef is good but the presentation average for $48 and the sauce is lack lustre. It seems from most review - the raw ingredients is outstanding but chef skill level quite lacking. Will I return to try other outlets? Yes. Especially where fresh ingredients is king rather than when seasoning or cooking is required. Service staff is outstanding. We were served by 3 different persons who were all very helpful.
3
Who will complain on a $15++ free flow wine, beer and flavored sake? Definitely not me! I can't get enough of the grilled squid, crab cakes and clams. And i ahd 2 rounds of garlic bread. Nicley buttered, crisp on one side and soft on the other. They've got good choices for oysters too.
4
I brought my friends who came visiting to UMI+VINO for dinner and we had live oysters, grilled squid, UMI salad, AUS Wagyu steak and Hokkaido Scallop and Konbu Pasta.The live oysters were served with this red wine shallot vinaigrette that complement the oysters so well and the oysters were shucked upon order. It taste so fresh and good. The grilled squid was also really fresh and you can taste a slight hint of wine. Even though its cooked ala-plancha, the texture taste just right. Not too chewy and the fragrance of the dish is mouth watering. The mains were awesome, fresh sashimi grade scallop and wagyu steak done just right.Overall, service was good and my friends love the place
3
We chose Umi+Vino because we saw a very attractive poster on the way to the Emporium Shokuhin on the side of the escalator. We ordered the hot seafood platter but the crab was so dry and skinny. The scallops and prawn just ok. However, the ginger chili (?) sauce on the sides was really helpful. The lobster bisque just standard. Service was very good though
3
I went there last night with family. We ordered the cold seafood platter, lobster & crab bisque, the grilled squid, 2 angel hair pasta, Umi salad, mash potato & garlic bread. The seafood was really fresh. We enjoyed the Dungeness crab, oysters & prawns. In general the octopus with vinegrette wasn't our cup of tea. The bisque was very full flavored. Feeds only 1 pax. But 4 of us managed to have a few spoonfuls each. Someone mentioned it reminded him of coffee. However, it wasn't a hit with us. The Hokkaido scallop pasta was recommended by a friend. The scallops were nearly melted in my mouth. However the Kombu was a little salty for our liking. The recommended Sakura Eli & tiger prawn pasta was a total let down. It wasn't anything special. The total bill came up to almost $300. On a whole, I don't think I will be going back.
4
I would give this 3.5 stars for food and 4 for pricing and decor. Value for money.Seafood galore and many Japanese whiskies too.Promotion for draft beer at $4.90 a glass. Kronenbourg 1664 - Nice, mild and fresh taste.Luscious lunch set available from 11.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. for a limited period only.3 courses for $26 for:Soup - chose Boston clam chowder - was not hot at all! What is the matter with the kitchen help???!!!Other soup choice is wild mushroom soup Change of cutlery after the soup which is nice.Mains Hokkaido scallops + konbu pasta - Yummy! Comes with olive but not saltish which is good.65 degrees chicken breast (tender chicken breast + herb potatoes + roasted fennel + onion thyme jus) - served hot. Yay! - good, jus is nice. Nice (meant to be hot food)should always be served hot. It makes all the difference! What's the point of servicing hot food at room temperature? Totally spoils good cooking. Duh!Other mains are: 8 hours braised wagyu beef bourguignon, pan seared salmon or AUS wagyu steak 250 gm (for an additional $8)You can also choose an UMI salad (mixed greens + sun dried tomatoes + garlic onion dressing) for an additional $6. We didn't.Dessert of the day - chose raspberry cake (good) & apricot cake (wont miss this).Other choices - cheese cake and banana cake.Besides the (not hot) soup, the only other 'Duh!' moment is an over zealous waitress who keeps throwing the paper napkins after every course even though they have not been used yet. Makes me feel like Pigpen of 'Peanuts' fame. Roll eyes
