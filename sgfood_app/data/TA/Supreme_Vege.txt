Delicious vegan food. The place to take your meat eating friends and not tell them till the end all the yummy food they ate was actually veg. Highly recommend shark fin's soups and spicy dishes. Not easy to find, hidden on 1st floor in right corner of Royal at Queens Hotel. Right next to Modern Art Museum off Bras Basah MRT Sta
