We tried the Indian buffet here as well as hosted a few parties here. The food is good, offers a wide range. Can be too congested if guests are too many.

The buffet spread was very good. Free flow of dosa and naan. Not expensive at $11.9. I would visit again if hungry...Love how the naan is freshly made hot.

The price is decent, and so is the food. Specializes in Indian dishes.
Does not offer payment by credit/debit card. Restaurant feels congested even when empty due to the seating arrangements. Food serving time is slow.

Obviously the management of this restaurant has taken pains to beef up their biz. Recently renovated this restaurant is now a pleasure to go to. Their buffet items are enough to more than satisfy the palate and very affordable at $9.90/-. Items include rice items, curries, dessert, dosas, various other dishes, chutney and other stuff like papadams. Ala carte items are also available. I had fried bee hoon goreng while my friend went for the buffet. The Chefs at this place are really mindful of using salt and sauce sparingly and this fact would be extremely pleasing to the health conscious like myself! The best part is I was able to also taste the buffet items my friend brought for me to the table without getting frowns from the staff! The staff are courteous and attentive.

Taste of food is not only the thing. How it is presented, how the staff behave with people and whether they provide you food as per their commitment is main things... Nothing was there. Our group was given time 7.15 pm and we reached there. They tried to push one more group at very same time and half of the space was gone. 50% of our group pax has to wait more than 35 minutes. His manager has misbehaved with group people like he is providing food FREE OF CHARGE. If they can not handle group, has to stop immediately to take reservations..

The buffet was delicious. We were struggling to find good vegetarian restaurant as we wanted food in a pure vegetarian restaurant only. The dinner buffet was really very good. The amount of north indian food was quite less and was predominantly south indian. Yet we enjoyed i

Are here tonight. Late on a Sunday night but it was a good choice. My partners Dosa was lovely and I had the buffet meal. Loads of fresh bread and two cokes for $22. Just be careful when choosing from the buffet selection. I ate some lovely vegetable dishes but by accident mixed some dessert on the same plate

We went with a friend, who is a big fan of the restaurant. Mr. Rohit took great care of us and served everything he could. He ensured we are more than happy and just kept on pampering us.We took buffet. The spread was good. Especially breads. They offer Puri, Tandoori roti, Nan, Dosa. It was a free flow kind of food. We ate and ate some more till we realised us enough was enough.I would like highlight one thing that the food did not make me lazy or feel heavier. Generally if we eat so much in a restaurant, you feel something in your stomach or chest, burps. This was one awesome experience. Nothing happened.Presentation wasnt great. But the quality of food was really good
