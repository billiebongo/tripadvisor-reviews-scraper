Love the pork chop. Traditional and hearty served with apple sauce (purée). Black pepper sauce - the best!

Have always returned whenever we are at Changi Village.
The standards has been maintained throughout the years. The stews are to die for!
Highly recommended!

Great service from the second you walk in to this place. Most of the seating is outside but they do have some tables inside. Take away is also offered. Very good menu with a mix of all sorts of dishes. No problem if you want to add or remove an ingredient. Bit expensive but so far I've always been very satisfied so it has been worth it. I always visit at least once when I'm staying in Changi Village.

chanced upon this place after a trip to a nearby kelong. a group of us were trying to find a place to sip some afternoon coffee and chit chat.the place looks slightly tired but don't be put off by the outlook as the staff are friendly. there is an afternoon promotion going on where you can order your dessert and add on a coffee or tea for an additional $2. a really nice place to sit and catch up with friends on a lazy afternoon.the decoration is heavy wooden and homely. staff are friendly and will occasionally come up to check on you to make sure everything is alright.apparently the pork knuckles is draw point here but we didn't get to try. next time

We love stopping in at Jacob's on our Saturday morning cycle route. The breakfast is always very generous in size and delicious! It's great value for money too, and the staff are always very warm and quick to serve. I just wish they were open on Sundays

After wandering around the variety of eateries in Changi village on my first evening in Singapore, I finally, around 9.30 pm, stumbled on this little cafe, which mercifully served alchohol. Many of the hawker stalls do not, and the rest are either Muslim or Hindu, so it was with a sense of relief I ordered a Tiger on Tap, and asked for their fresh fish & chips. (Dear reader, please don't condemn my lack of adventure, as the village offers a bewildering variety of very interesting food offerings, and, having just got off a 13 hour flight from London, my head was like concrete, and I had trouble with the accents) Reviving briskly from my non-alcoholic stupor, I happily tucked into some pan-fried ikan kerapu, a kind of grouper, and big sweet potato chips with a scrummy salad. Two more Tigers later and I was off back to the hotel and bed, sleeping like a log until that strange, early tropical dawn, humid and spice-laden ai

My third time there . Good ambience n most important good food . Love their roasted beef , mushroom soup , tomatoes soup . A very attentive lady served us . Unfortunately my daughter fell sick during the dinner n she offered us pain killer n also helped her to the car . Will return again with my family . Love this place

If you served at Royal Air Force Changi (including Commonwealth forces) then on your return to Changi Village on a nostalgia visit then go to Jacobs Cafe.. Best Fish and Chips you can get. You will always be welcome there and it is just what you need after a bit of a journey from the Capita
5
I am a regular customer at this cafe. I love their curry chicken which is only available every Tuesday and Thursday. You need to make reservation for the curry chicken as it will be sold out by noon time if you intend to have it for dinner. I also love their beef cheeks which is not on their menu and you need to pre-order weeks before. A great place not to be missed!

Situated among the many Asian food eateries in Changi village Jacobs stands out with its English country style presentation. The owner is very welcoming and there is a marvellous waiter who seems to be there most of the time with a great sense of humour. Happy hours and specials on beers etc. Traditional western style food like steak and kidney pie, cottage pie. Also lasagne, pastas and german style food along with traditional cooked breakfasts. Salads. The food is of very good quality if a tad more pricey than other local eateries but it is a different offering in the area and seems somewhat of a novelty in that respect and the service is superb so it is worth it. The pork knuckles are excellent, we had the hainanese braised knuckles with rice and veg which is meant to be for two to four people. Two starving people! Very large. They have Lavazza coffee and was the only place we found locally to serve proper barista coffee. Very nice ambience. Highly recommend

wonderful food and cozy environment that u must not miss. especialky pork knuckles, situated at cirner of the island, an hidden gem for u to explore
5
This restaurant offers a good selection of western cuisine. Try it's German pork knuckles. It's good!
5
Jacob's serves super food with an understated, friendly and professional flair that hits all the right spots. The staff are great and warm with a knack for knowing when you need them. Love it cannot recommend it highly enough.
5
Jacob’s cafe at Changi village have Super good western food and price is reasonable. I love the sausages comb, pork knuckle , Hawaii pizza n onion soup are so good , we came back to again within a month.
4
When I am in Changi, this is one of my favourites. The location is nice, with wood furniture and nice waiters. Not bad the pizza. If you look for a Western meal with Asian nuance, I recommend for an easy and accurate meal.
5
According to my wife the best wrap ever! Certainly one of the best. We had to wait some time as they are freshly made, even down to peeling and preparing the avocado to go with the chicken and bacon, but well worth the wait, it was a busy lunch time too.Complimented the owner
5
Decided to check it out after seeing some good reviews and we loved it here. Wholesome tasty food and relaxed atmosphere. We had carbonara which was loaded with delicious bacon and mushrooms, beef stew and beef cheek. Kids had dessert too and it was unanimous. We will be back
5
Wanting something other than Asian food for a change, decided to come here for the pork knuckle after reading about how good it was. It really was fantastic - cripsy and juicy and tasty - BUT no one said how BIG the portions are here! Shared the pork with one other person as well as a salad special that was going on - the salad was great too- lots of greens and pine nuts & proscuitto - yum! But it was huge too! The mashed potatoes & gravy are truly home-style and very good. Good wine & beer selection, and we thought the prices were decent. Desserts looked good - but we were too full!
4
Nice place to sip beer and chilling out with friends, waiting time is a bit long though. Me and my friend had hot and spicy chicken wings, french fries and a jug of Tiger beer, total cost 48$. Happy hours from 3 to 6 pm daily.Food Service Price Cleanliness Environment
3
The food is too sweet for our taste bud. For example, the chicken stew was on the sweet side, which taste kinda weird. The portion served were reasonable, price was on the steep side. Their staff were friendly, courteous and attentive. They do not rush you out of the restaurant when you are done with your meal. Worth a visit, but not a regular patron.
4
Whenever we are looking for western and near Changi, we will dine at this place. The staff is really friendly and the place makes you feel at home.
4
All time favourite ... The beef stew is cooked to perfection. You can either have it with steam rice or baguette.
Oh, and their homemade style kaya ( coconut jam ) is awesome too :) They sell them in take-away bottles. Very authentic!
4
Service is good.
Food .. didn't try much but its good.
This place need more fan. Singapore is HOT place.
I was quite surprised that every time I use washroom there is always a courtesy reminder to mind the steps. That really shows the dedication.

Ordered a takeaway Caesar salad earlier today. Nice creamy Caesar dressing. Though a bit costly, but reasonable for a cafe setting. $16.90
5
I've been dining at Jacob's Cafe on average once a week. Neat layout both indoors and outdoor dining. Clean n Fast service. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Sandwiches are great, fish & chips or even a good selection of mains. Beers and wines also available.
5
Jacobs place in changi village is a great place to be , we had been advised to go for good food and good atmosphere, the owners wife was the one who served us with such grace the good ordered was also of good taste we who were five of us all enjoyed the meal , the owner himself came along spend considerable time with us , the music and serenity will surely take me there again and again , a must for the tourist

We found this restaurant about 150 metres from our hotel (the Village Hotel Changi) and for the time of day(5.30pm) it was the first one that was open. We were speaking to the owner and he enticed us in with a promise of something unique and that's what we got. I had the beef tendon stew (braised beef tendon cooked with white radish) and Joanna had the mutton stew (mutton, toufu puff, toufu stick, bamboo shoots, wolfberries and black fungus) and both dishes were delicious.The menu was English and German with many of the dishes having an Asian twist, I had certainly never had beef tendons before and the mutton stew was not traditional. At the same time many of the dishes were typically European and the owner told us that many expats came to sample his wares as a change from the typical Asian food restaurants. And it was typically (?) home-style country cooking.If you are in the area I would recommend you check Jacobs CafÃ©

Came here afew times with the hub. Last nite brought our children over to have dinner. We ordered:1. Fish n Chips2. Chix Cutlet3. Aglio Olio w/ Grilled Salmon4. Aglio Olio Vegetarian 5. Beef Stew w/riceThe children enjoyed their food and even gave a thumbs up! Thou the Aglio Olio taste quite spicy. Staffs were attentive too. Overall, awesome nice yummilicious!

Visited this restaurant for dinner last night, and as ever it did not disappoint.There is both indoor and outdoor seating, within inside being air-conditioned of course. There is good Wi-Fi available inside and outside.Staff and essentially Filipino, and very attentive. The food is delicious. I chose cottage pie for my main course last night, followed by the banana sundae. A real treat dining at Jacobs
3
Tried the salmon aglio olio pasta which was sprinkled with plenty of garlic and big slab of salmon. The portion is huge which might explain the price point. Taste is decent but not exactly memorable. Hence for the long wait and rather pricey lunch experience, I'll not return again as I think pasta mania can provide better value. Jacob's Cafe has departed from it cosy and homely feel it provided to me ten years back unfortunately
4
With colleagues for lunch, a very nice place: fresh salads, nice curry, a great place as an alternative to office canteen.
5
Jacobs is consistent on quality mainly western food which has a home cooked taste about it at great value. My favourite is Lamb Shank, one of the best I have tasted anywhere in the world, basic good tasty food, wonderful.
5
Stumbled onto Jacob's cafe while staying over in village hotel, ordered Hungarian goulash which was so delicious! The accompanying baguette was crispy on outside and pillowy on the inside, a rare find in Singapore and similar to the ones I ate in France! Shepherd's pie was not too bad as well - the potato was nicely baked and fluffy! Not to mention the gentlemen who served us was really courteous and helpful - didn't manage to get his name - thanks for the good service and good food!wanted to go back on the day after but cafe was closed on Sundays...Will be back again to try out other dishes like the pork knuckle
5
We come back here as often as we can. We've patronised this place for more than a decade and they are consistently good. There is a range of Hainanese dishes (stews) and western dishes. Though they open late, they also have a breakfast menu which is excellent. I think the breads are freshly baked. The menu is wide enough to keep members of a big family happy - fish and chips, ,mushroom soup and bread, Hungarian goulash, oxtail stew, sausage platter, curry, Hainanese stew. This is our go-to place to eat when we are in Changi and we sometimes also decide to spend our weekends at Changi so that we can eat here
3
We had a turkey mushroom pie, shepherd's pie, baked macaroni, calamari and junior sausage meal, cost about $83.50 , without drinks, no service charge or GST if I recall correctly. FOOD HITS: Turkey Mushroom pie was good, large chunks of mushrooms, tasty turkey (though can be more tender), excellent crust and a lot of carrots. Baked macaroni was a good big portion and tasty, came with minced beef and was substantial and tasty. MISS: Calamari was expensive $14 for 14 pieces exactly, Shepherd's pie was too much potato and not much meat. Service was good by the lady boss. We requested the staff to let us sit inside when there were seats available but they forgot our request and we saw others ushered in instead. Overall, I think if you want some western food but I think a bit pricey
5
As an ex pat I found Jacobs Cafe to be a home from home.... the food is home cooked and delicious for someone from UK ... not only that, as someone who regularly ate there with or without husband and friends, I have always enjoyed Jacobs and the friendships
4
We popped in for breakfast after a 1 night stay at village hotel. We had bacon and eggs and lovely fruit yogurt, and some great coffee. Some beautiful inspirational messages as well on the boards and bottom of each menu page. What a great way to start the day.
5
Stopped for lunch - fantastic wraps, lovely desserts, great coffee. The meals others were eating looked great too. A variety of dishes - European and local - top quality products if the chicken and bacon are anything to go by. I wish we'd discovered it sooner - about to leave these shores, and no time to go back.Like everywhere in Changi, alcohol is more expensive than elsewhere. Never really understood that, as you have to travel to get there... But not a criticism of Jacobs cafe as it's the same everywhere
5
Nice little place to have something to eat.The menu covers everything from pizzas to lasagne,pies and pasta.Prices are reasonable.They do a great mash potato too!All our food was good home cooked grub.Plenty of drinks and cocktails on the menu.The dessert menu was also a great choice.Try the Lava Cake with ice cream it's delicious.We came away absolutely stuffed with no room in our bellies
5
If you've had one noodle too many try, Jacobs Cafe.It's opposite Changi point ferry terminal among the row of cafe's. You can also catch taxis outside of Jacobs cafe, get away from the queue for taxis outside of the terninal.Good selection of sandwiches and meals.From pulled pork sandwiches to shepherd's pie. All day breakfast to pizza and pasta or even roast duck
4
The place is good and clean. Food quality and quantity, both are excellent. I loved the food here and visited this place 4-5 times.
5
Food was great. We ate here often during our stay here. Portion was okay with its price tag. Salad was great, was hoping to offer variety of dressings.
4
I went here as this is where most of the expats working here go for lunch. The menu was very varied with good choice
3
Only western food place in changi village, ok food, overpriced. Nice staff, terrace is good when it's not rainy
5
Great bratwurst and some of the best sauerkraut I have tasted. As much as I love Asian food, it is nice to have an excellent Western option for when I am missing home.
4
We were late for dinner and Changi Village was nearby with multiple food options. We were glad we selected Jacob's. It was nearing closing time but we were still treated with a lot of courtesy not seen everywhere. The outside sitting area was pleasant thanks to the rains thru the evening. They also have a a/c sitting area. The starters ordered were classic Fish n Chips and they came out tops. As did the chilled beer. The chicken stew and the salad was great. The lava cake and icecream really came out tops. A good try among what was open at that time.
5
Even after my visit to Germany I maintain that Jacob's makes the best German pork knuckle ever (note that they offer the asian braised pork knuckle too). Perfect crackling that stayed crispy throughout the meal, flavourful succulent meat, and an absolutely delish sauerkraut.Jacob's also dishes up a mean oxtail stew, with huge chunks of root vegetables and fall-off-the-bone tender meat. I love how much attention they pay to the small details like the accompanying baguettes - the baguettes were served hot, crisp, and pillowy on the inside. Regardless of how busy they are they've never failed to serve great bread with their stews. Absolutely love this homely cafe.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Jacobs-Cafe/cmbz/1475F14F-8CA1-4FC5-86A8-2CD20E8AC74

We went there last week for a light meal.The spaghetti was delicious and well endowed with loads of fresh vegetables.Seemed a little pricey but for the qtty and quality of food, I would not mind paying that.Very well toasted garlic bread and coffee

First visit to this restaurant. Saturday night at 8.30pm - very busy and had to wait 10 minutes for a table which was quite acceptable. Staff very helpful and gave us the menu to peruse. Wide selection of dishes on the menu, mainly western including varieties of sausage, pizza, pies, pasta and roast meats - caters to all tastes. Ordered shepards pie which was excellent and came with a side salad. Banana split for desert - very nice with selection of flavours of ice cream. Kindly and attentive staff with good service. Claims traditional country style food which it certainly has. Good selection of drinks and cocktails. Indoor (air con) and out door dining available. Left my mobile phone behind when I left and came back 40 minutes later to find the staff had put it safely to one side for me. So honest, and I'm so grateful to them.Make a reservation at busy periods. Reasonably priced - good value. Would certainly visit again

My friend and I went there for lunch today. He had a tiger prawn & mango salad and I had the special for the day of roast rib-eye beef salad. All ingredients were fresh. The beef strips and the medium-size prawns were succulent. The salad dressing matched very well too.I have been to Jacob's cafe before and I was not disappointed with any dish I ordered. I like the beef goulash, German pork knucle. The truffle french fries would be a great snack to go with beer or on its own.Prices look high and that's partly because it is all inclusive of service charge and Gst
