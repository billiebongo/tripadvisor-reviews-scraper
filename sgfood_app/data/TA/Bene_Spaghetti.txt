could tell that the staff are trying very hard to blend in japanese and italian in singapore, as well as thier warm yet cranky japanese style service. food is average so is the mushi pasta, but the service deserves a compliment.

My friend booked this place for a friday evening dinner and I must say that this restaurant did not disappoint. From the moment that we arrived, a table was booked with a nice hand written note by the staff making us feel just at home. There was a group of people who probably came after work for food and drinks and were rather rowdy but the staff still paid attention to our orders. It isnt easy to find this place, but once I did found this place it is such a nice hideout with authentic and also fusion food. From the the starters to the pizza(though the base of the crust was burnt) to the read wine beef spaghetti that was ordered, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I will definitely be back here again because of the perfect hideout, the excellent service and the amazing fusion food as well

I have been to the restaurant several times and would introduce my friends who might like that kind of simple, rustic setting. Food is simple yet tasty. Nothing too fanciful to impress but why should it be? Dining experience is casual and comfortable like eating at home. Perfect for family, friends and business

Came here last night with a few friends and had a the most amazing experience! The restaurant was cozy and comfortable, and first impressions immediately warmed me up when i saw a super cute sign on the table which was hand-drawn in pink marker, indicating our reservation. Each table has a clapper / those bell things you play with in primary school to ring to call the waitor. They respond promptly and every one was so friendly! Later, after realising that one friend doesn't eat beef and another doesn't eat pork (because we were asking which dishes didn't have beef and pork) they automatically altered the combination of dishes on our 4 pax antipasto mix platter (YUMMY) to reduce the pork and beef dishes and add others without us even asking!! \o/ So grateful (and they added dishes of equal or even higher value)They also realised we were celebrating a birthday and our friendly waitor off-handedly asked her what was her name was during one conversation. Later, they suprised us by dimming the lights and coming out with a baby accordion which one of the girls played happy birthday on, and a yummy tiramisu cake with my friend's name written on the plate (: I could go on about more happy experiences but I won't spoil it. This place was such a pleasant surprise and we are hoping to come back many more times

I stumbled into this wonderful little restaurant by chance and I wasn't disappointed one bit. They have some great deals during the week like One for One Sangria on Mondays, which, if you know how expensive drinking in Singapore is, is fantastic! We ordered two 4 cheese pizzas and I can safely say it was one of the best we've had islandwide. Recommend it!!

Been to Bene Spaghetti 3 times and I'd love to go back again.The serve the steam spaghetti in a very special way, you got to go experience yourself.The bread before the main is very soft and tasty, I secretly ask for more coz it's really good but I regretted coz the steam spaghetti is much more delicious! Check up their free flow wine, they offer few different red and white wine selections and it's very cheap

Came here for lunch earlier in the week and chose one of the lunch sets. These consisted of a small salad, a drink and a (small) serving of pasta. Generally the food quality was quite good (particularly in this price range), but the serving was a little small and I was still hungry afterwards

We spent a delightful afternoon at this establishment. Lunch sets. Initially disappointed with the limited choices with no ala carte. But the selection that we had turned out to be excellent, cooked to perfection. But of all I must say was the customer service. Our host, Nora, was the most entertaining and accommodative person that I have ever experienced at Singapore dining. She was hospitable, attentive, spontaneous and just fun to be around. We were entertained throughout our dining experience with so much laughter. As some of us were celebrating our birthday, the staffs put in much effort in ensuring that it was a celebratory occasion with props and accordion to serenade us. Truly a sincere, genuine customer satisfaction restaurant with exceptional staff especially Nora. Thank you for the wonderful experience.

Celebrated my friend's birthday with several girl friends and we enjoyed the food very much as the mushi pasta comes in a hot pot with a tall cover that looked like a tall hat. The pasta were deliciously and so were the onen egg pizza, the asparagus with mushroom, etc. Most of all we have a surprise from the restaurant as suddenly the light was turned off and the waitress with a piece of cake, the chef, and another waitress playing a small piano sang happy birthday to my friend. It was indeed a joyous surprise and we had a wonderful time

Circular Road, just behind Boat Quay is a street full of surprises, and Bene Spaghetti is a good one. The fusion between Italian and Japanese cuisine is not impressive (except from some dishes, it's either Italian or Japanese), but all dishes are very tasty and well cooked. Plus you can choose to drink Sangria, Sake or the Wine free flow (which is under 30 SGD)! The deco is nice and the staff super friendly. A good address to spend good time with friends before heading to the night life
