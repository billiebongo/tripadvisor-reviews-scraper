If u have PA card, u r entitled 15% discount for this authentic Szechuan food restaurant. The dishes there are simple and really spicy but the taste is really good. One advice: request a glass of ice water (freely provided) before you go ahead

Food was not too bad. Service was friendly and attentive. Ambience was quite pleasant; it wasn't too noisy despite a small dinner crowd.

Went to the outlet in the new Tampines OneHub centre. Lovely ambience and very good Szechuan food. Service was prompt and friendly. Quiet restaurant, despite it being full at lunch time, which is a nice change from other Chinese restaurant. Loved the yang chow fried rice made with brown rice..... Very tasty
