Great place for a drink located under a bridge near the Merlion. Prices are reasonable in this self-service café. They have a range of cold drinks, including iced coffee which we enjoyed in the shade next to the water as a break in our sight-seeing.

Toast Junction, Singapore The review covers the Toast Junction kiosk/cafe under the Esplanade road bridge and a few steps from Merlion Park. There is some confusion on TripAdvisor with addresses and location of the 2-3 restaurants with the same registered name in Singapore.We’d been exploring the town on foot for four hours starting at Raffles Hotel on Beach Road – where the bus had dropped us – then across the original colonial heritage area taking in the buildings centred upon the Padang which was once where the sea shore used to be – and then down to Marina Bay and across the pedestrian-only Jubilee Bridge; admiring the high-rise cityscape.Hanging around with the crowd of 150 or more taking photos and selfies on the viewing deck in front of the charismatic Merlion - symbol of the city - and taking in the cityscape across Marina Bay, it was time for a ‘mid-morning’ break – coffee & brioche beckoned; we started looking. And there was the Toast Junction, just a few metres from the Merlion – and around the corner from where the Merlion used to sit looking out over the Singapore River - and under the busy Esplanade Bridge and the lead-on to the Anderson Bridge was the Toast Junction – bright welcoming lights, tables, chairs, counter and service kiosk shoe-horned into a dark corner. The place was empty. It was a fine day, but this would be a great place to escape that unexpected rain shower when walking the Boat Quay – Raffles landing site circuit. There was a second but much smaller Merlion statue in a pond in the little park on the left of the slope leading down under the bridges and, equally interesting, a lone sleeper seated on the balustrade and leaning against the bridge foundations as you entered the kiosk. Throughout our 15 minutes break, we could see him shaking awake and then nodding off again – oblivious to the world around him, he seemed lost in his tiredness.We ordered a coffee cappuccino and helped ourselves to a 300 ml can of Coke from the glass case adjacent to the counter, and paid S$9. Coffee was good. Coke was, well, Coke. The drinks were reasonable value in what was essentially a quiet corner of a busy tourist track; barely any people around, the noise of the traffic above muted by the road foundations and that prompt and friendly service just when we needed a stop. No brioche then? We were carrying snacks. Choose your seat with care and you could look out over the Singapore River and reflect upon what Stamford Raffles would have thought of the place almost 200 years after his original landing.
