The food here is good and the service was ok. But the way they calculate the 25% Gourmet Collection discount... certainly some improvements can be made back end!

The restaurant was very cosy and staff service was excellent. Definitely a good and nice place to be with your special one and served with great food. Will surely come back again.
5
Good food with excellent service to match! I recommend their daily semi-buffet breakfast. Best in hotel breakfast ever!
5
The food at Baba Chews is excellent. We had the pork rib pongteh that just slid off the bones, the beef rendang that was so succulent and tender you’d think it had been stewing for hours, the full-bodied chap Chye that was bursting with flavour.
4
Beautiful deco. Nice food but portions a bit small. Price on the high side. Authentic peranakan food. delicious. Best to make reservations beforehand.
5
We went for the Chinese New Year special lunch menu which offers bite size a la carte samples. We enjoyed every dish and the duck roll is especially good. The durian dessert is also a highlight. Staffs are polite and attending. We really enjoyed ourselves.
4
Wonderful service with a great CNY banquet . We enjoyed the chefs particpation in tossing the salad . Fantastic taste Best duck in tamarind sauce. Most enjoyable meal. As we were staying hotel Indigo we also got a discount. We had a lovely breakfast there as well.
5
The food was delicious, service attentive, and atmosphere beautiful. My family of 4 ate outside, and there was a lovely water fountain that my kids enjoyed while waiting for our meal. I love how early they're open for breakfast, great for tourists. We got eggs benedict, belgian waffles, kaya toast with dimsum, and a big kids' breakfast. The western fare was definitely better than the Asian stuff. (Dim sum was dry and lacked flavor, but everything else was awesome!) All that, plus pulled coffee and tea, made for a pretty pricey breakfast ($75!), so this could not possibly be a regular habit for us. But it was a lovely treat

Nice ambience. Good for gatherings, but food is disappointing. 1. The complimentary crackers were not crispy. 2. The XO crab meat fried rice is not fragent. You can't taste the XO sauce. Personally I think is a wise choice for the chef to use mixed vegetable as ingredient for this dish because if makes it looks cheap. 2. The itek tim consomme (duck soup) is tasty. Authentic. 3. BBQ stingray. The slice was too thick, flavour of the chillie was unable to be absorbed by the fish meat in the middle. You can find better ones at Hawker centres. 4. Vegetable was crunchy but without much flavour. For the price you pay, I think you can expect more.
4
We ordered dishes from all-day dining menu instead of festive buffet as we preferred peranakan over fusion/western. Tasty dishes in this order: Beef Short Ribs Rendang, Sweet and Sour Pork Belly, Wasabi Prawn and Chap Chye which complimented white rice well. Although Chap Chye was dry and lack any gravy/sauce. I would visit more frequently if more peranakan dishes are offered: e.g.: fish head curry, ngo heong, sotong/ayam buah keluak The decor is classy and well maintained. Service staff is friendly but some needed reminders. Ideal to make reservation 2-3 days in advance as place may be fully seated and affordable parking at Katong Square
4
Service is excellent. Authentic nonya food at affordable prices. Atmosphere is cosy and exquisite. Suitable for big groups.
4
Baba Chews is absolutely a go-to restaurant for Peranakan Cuisines.
A tad on the high side for price but worth it!
Atmosphere and service are what you will not be disappointed about!
5
They have lots of nice and international choices for the breakfast.
All different fresh juices..Quick service and nice staff.
4
This place is is truly a hidden gem for Peranakan food. It’s a fairly new restaurant but despite that, the food is authentic. If there is any flaw it’s perhaps the slow service on a Saturday night. Nonetheless this is my new go to place if I have a craving for Peranakan food
5
My mother-in-law, my wife and I visited Katong area and decided to eat at Baba Chew, authentic Peranakan restaurant (formerly the Joo Chiat Police Station).We ordered satay, non hiang, beef rendang, chicken pauhkerah, prawn tempa, eggplant and durian dessert. Next time you are around Katong area, go eat at Baba Chew. There are plenty of parking lots at the Holiday Inn Express Hotel Katong (at the back)
4
Good Peranakan food, authentic - Iberico pork babi ponteh is a must try - the tender meat and the flavour is good with lots of "rempah" in it. The Itek tim soup is another dish to try. Barramundi sambal fish is another good try. The rice is flavourful and even the water has a nice tinge of lemon. The service is good and very polite. Would highly recommend and reasonable parking at the katong plaza. Environment in a nice katong peranakan environment. But one thing I do not quite understand ia a huge bar in a Peranakan restaurant
3
Dinner at Baba’s was nothing spectacular for most dishes; with the sole dish of curry fish head being the most outstanding! Crowd was obvious even for a Wednesday, which makes me wonder if I might have not ordered the right dishes! Will be back soon to review this again
3
Things have not changed Personally the food and service are good BUT for a restaurant that is part of a hotel to charge $1 for ice water is ludicrous. Never had to be charged for water in any hotel type restaurant before...Petes Place, Wolloomooloo no charge oh well
3
It was my very first few nights in Singapore hanging around to look for decent local food. It serves the purpose with decent food. I wanna highlight Chef Soon warm service even walked out of kitchen to ensure my glass of water is refill, checking if the food suits my glass of white wine. Service needs plenty of attention since the outlet works like no one is managing. Something to work on
2
The restaurant was easy to locate. The decor of the restaurant was a mix of modern vintage. The center piece of the restaurant was their bar.We were quickly seated after the server found our reservation. However we were not satisfied with the seats. 5 of us were given a 4 seater table - uncomfortable for a dining experience. We requested to change to the bigger table and were promptly shifted after making our request.Hot water were served, so were our food. We ordered Pong Tauhu soup, Chilli Crab Cake, Ayam Buah Keluak, Itek Sio, Iberico Pork Ribs Pongteh, Nonya Fried Seabass, Udang Masak Lemak and Chap Chye,The Pong Tauhu soup reminded me of Crystal Jade’s wan-ton soup with a few meatballs – an extremely strange combination. The Chilli Crab Cake was dry, too dry. No doubt, the chef was not stingy on the crab meat, the dryness of the cake was painful to swallow. The sauce, however, was very nice. The Ayam Buah Keluak, Itek Sio and Iberico Pork Ribs Pongteh were too salty and sweet. The Nonya Fried Seabass looked as bad as it tasted. The Udang Masak Lemak was similar to sweet & sour prawns. Finally, the Chap Chye - the toughness of the vegetables, and the blandness. I’m not a good cook, but I have made better chap chye. Overall damage - $220. Will I return? Well, most probably not. Baba Chews has very cleverly marketed itself for serving food from Straits of Malacca NOT a Peranakan restaurant. If you are looking for a Peranakan restaurant, please look somewhere else. This is definitely not the place to go to
5
Still the same great dining experience, perfected by consistent exceptional gourmet and service. Thanks.
3
Very nice and relax ambience. How we the food portions were very tiny and they charge $1 per head for tap water. Imagine going there as a family of 10. Its additional $10 for flouride water.
5
Was expecting a lot more"fusion". Prices are reasonable but the portions are smaller than other restaurants.
Drinks are a tad expensive.
Nice environment. Quick and good service. Worthy of a revisit for me.
3
Food serving portion is little for the price paid...taste is ok for some dishes but curry fish is not cooked in gravy but strained,n put in the sauce , not fragrant enough...even ice water cost $1 per cup refillable
4
Went for brunch. Down sides:-1) need to top up $10 per pax in order to have traditional brew and juices. 2) no replenishing of juice during my two hours stay there.3) Food spread limitedPlus:-1) Service is excellent2) Food were very tasty I must say. Will be back to try their dinner
4
The restaurant is attached to the Hotel indigo, so I used it for both Breakfast and Dinner. The service was very good. The Breakfast was nice with freshly cooked breakfast rather than a buffet for hot food.For dinner we had local Singaporean dishes which were very nice and presented well
5
Hosted a party here in July (didn't have much time to enjoy the food then) and came back because a friend gave feedback that the food was good. Indeed it is. Loved the spring roll, babi pongteh, and fish.. especially love the decor and vibe there
1
Went for brunch with 3 other friends. The atmosphere is amazing but food selection is small and personally, I don’t think it is worth trying in terms of food quality. There is def better Brunch options our though.
4
I had dinner twice here and enjoyed the meal on both occasions. The service was excellent as was the food. I had the Barramundi special of the day which was interestingly prepared with lovely aromatic spices and the Penang Char Kway Teow was especially memorable. I do think that the portions are a bit small though but on the whole I was pleasantly surprised
4
Heard lots of "Paranakan" food (& culture) but not knowing what about. Our hostess explained Chinese seafarers 1,000 years ago settled along Malacca strait, intermarrying with Malaysians retaining distinct culture of Chinese-Malay different from rest of Malaysia. It was popular Sat lunch serving buffet though we ordered ala carte. Deliciously & well-prepared, spicey but not excessive & not as heavy as most Indian dishes. Prices up-scale but unreasonable. Service okay due to full-house lunch time. Definitely worth trying when visiting S
5
Great ambience and setting, though table water is chargeable at $1 per pax. Beef rendang is one of the best we’ve ever had; a must-try! Service staff are friendly and accommodating. Good experience overall.
4
Mostly Peranakan cuisine but they do serve some western food. Spread are pretty even, I love the local "kueh" stuff (if you know what i meant)and they have Laksa and nasi lemak too. Helpful and wonderful staff, Westley is one of them. Thank you
4
Reasonable price .
Nice ambience and music
The place is clean and organised
I had ordered a curry fish head at SGD 38 and is yummy ;)
5
Nice traditional yet modern atmosphere. Food is good too. My overseas guests enjoyed dinner at this place.
4
Food can be better but the ambience is nice. Service was also good. Suitable for both family or dates.
3
Lunch at babachew on a weekday.
Ordered curry fish head , nice. Fresh red fish and thick curry sauce.
Ordered fry egg too but the egg was too normal.
5
I'm not an expert on Pernakan food but the dishes here tasted really good and my friends say it's pretty authentic. The decor is quaint and cozy. and the service extremely friendly.
2
Restaurant is overrated. Food was not hot enough and gave me in impression that they were all served from a big precooked pot. The most disappointing was the dessert - chendol. I would have expect restaurant to serve chendol with fresh coconut, but not this restaurant. When the dessert came, the coconut was lumpy and it was obvious that they were not the fresh coconut , and it taste rancid. Overall, disappointing and overpriced
4
We went to this restaurant with family members, and liked the dÃ©cor and service.We found the menu was fairly limited, and servings fairly small. The Beef Rendang was tasty, as was the fried rice and chicken dish.The wine list was comprehensive, and the dining room staff were attentive, in particular a waiter called Banlan (?) who helped us with choices and had a good sense of humour.Our group would highly recommend him as a member of the wait staff
4
Had the eggplant, Babi Pongteh and Beef Rendang with Crab fried rice. Eggplant was delish without being overly oily. The Crab fried rice was very fragrant and tasty. The rendang was a bit of a letdown, with the beef being way too dry. The sauce was still very good, just that the dryness of the meat let the dish down greatly. Fave of the night was the Babi Pongteh. Sauce was delectable and the meat was noisy, fall of the bone and so good. Service was attentive and helpful and never obtrusive. Will return for sure.
5
Baba Chews offers Peranakan cuisine that is so delish you will definitely come back for more! Accompanied by friendly, amazing staff, this is the place to be for people with a hearty appetite.
4
Housed in the former Joo Chiat police station and tastefully decorated, Baba Chew's is a feast for the senses. The staff were really friendly despite the large group and orders we had, and the food was yummy. we especially loved the fish curry!
4
Beautiful place we go for the breakfast. The team is helpful and friendly.
Nice place outside the center.
4
Surprise to see western food in the menu, however, not courage to try the peranakan western food. Still prefer the authetical.
4
It's a cozy place to spend an evening with friends get-together and the entire experience is made even better with the food that tasted great. My favourite was Itek Sio - tender duck leg paired with a savoury sauce that has a tinge of Assam. delicious.
3
The restaurant was easy to locate. The decor of the restaurant was a mix of modern vintage. The center piece of the restaurant was their bar.We were quickly seated after the server found our reservation. However we were not satisfied with the seats. The seats were low and uncomfortable for a dining experience. We requested to change to the high chairs & tables and were promptly shifted after making our request.Hot water were served, so were our food. We ordered chap chye, pong tauhu soup, chilli crab cake, sambal stingray and crabmeat fried rice with x.o. sauce.The soup was bland, with a few meatballs. It could be how pong tauhu should taste like, but it wasn't appealing to our palate. The chilli crab cake was dry, too dry. No doubt, the chef was not stingy on the crab meat, the dryness of the cake was painful to swallow. The sauce, however, was very nice.The chap chye, and fried rice were served subsequently. Looking at the other table being served their sambal stingray, it looked deliciously appetising.We dig into chap chye, only to be put off by the toughness of the vegetables, and the blandness. I have had better chap chye. The fried rice was surprisedly tasty, with much "wok-hee", bringing out the aroma of the x.o. sauce.The stingray portion was huge. The sambal was spicy and flavourful. But when we started to eat the stingray, it was dry & overcooked. And we had to ask the staff for green lime, which is a mandatory condiment for sambal stingray. We were very disappointed, since we had better stingray at Chomp Chomp
5
Excellent service and great food !! The XO Fried Rice and Rendang Beef is my favorite. I finished the meal with Chendo - a coconut milk desert - a must try !!
1
Frankly it was terrible. The service was abysmal; the waitress "forgot" to give us serviette, missed part of the order and our water glasses were never replenished.The food was not worth the price!!!!!
3
Food was average and too salty. The waiters ' service was slow and when we asked to refill our water, only one glass was refilled. When we wanted to settle the bill, it took them sometime to see and hear us. Not worth the price that we paid
3
Located in the former Joo Chiat Police Station the cuisine at Baba Chews is Peranakan fusion. Quite subtle as the rumpah or spice mix is tweaked to appeal perhaps to those who eschew a stronger and pungent taste. The crab kepeting was a sizable lump which was a trifle 'hard'. Got to be careful portioning it lest it should fly out of the small soup bowl. The pork rib was rather good, very tender. The ngoh hiang was so-so but the sambal terung (brinjal) was quite good. This lunch meal was for three pax and it came to $65++, and I used a voucher from the Gourmet Collection to offset the bill. The ambience is quaint and the place is quiet enough to chat over lunch. Enjoy
4
I really enjoy coming to baba chews (3rd time I think ..) I particularly love their beef rendang and they have a wine selection at reasonable prices.
5
Second visit and find the food taste was consistent. Service was excellent. Reasonable price. I am going to dine there again.
5
Had a business dinner with colleagues. The ambience is really good and peaceful. They also have a private room for larger group. The beer and wine selection is very good with lots of options. The service staff is really helpful and always very enthusiastic in food recommendation. They were running a promotion for bbq lobster, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Lobsters were very well cooked and very tasty. We also ordered typical Local food ranging from chicken pork and vegetable. All the dishes were delicious and tasted authentic. They also hv quiet good selection for vegetarians. We finished with local desert Bobo chacha and chendol. Overall a very good experience. Must go if you want to experience local delicacies with good drinks menu.
3
Place is nicely done up. I like the interior. Food was good but portions were small and pricey. But overall ok
4
Very good local fare with excellent service. I stayed at the hotel so I was able to eat here several times during my stay. I was able to try several dishes that rivaled those at the other nice establishments I was able to try in the city. The bar had a good selection of local and imported beers, wines, & spirits. Worth a visit even if you are not a guest of the hotel
5
Modern peranakan cuisine that serves homely and comforting food. Stingray could be more charred but it has a generous portion ($22), and chilli crab cakes are a tad too expensive for starter dish ($15) but so good! Chap Chye is delicious too ($12) and marinated pork ribs are tender and tasty. They have cool cocktails too!Ambience is beautiful with pretty tiles and low lighting. Great for dates actually. Location is also pretty central right next to i12 mall. We spent $95 for two on the avg after gst and service charge but could have ordered one less dish as we couldn't finish it
2
In short: If you're looking for a quite restaurant and good food, there are better peranakan restaurants in this price range. Service is trying their best (A for effort) but not very well trained. The food is mediocre and the noise level is very high. Hard to hear each other and make it an enjoyable dining experience
4
This place is the nearest bar to the Indigo hotel and has a great atmosphere. Apparently the food is really tasty but I was only here for a drink.They offer cocktails and have their own version of a Singapore Sling. Also good selection of gin, scotch and vodka
4
I have been planning to visit Baba Chews for sometime now as I just stay down the road. Finally made reservation and tried it. the 72hr Iberico pork rib is amazing, soft and flavourful. Really liked the crab cake preserved veg duck soup. Will be back again.
5
We really enjoyed this restaurant. I admit to being apprehensive based on the reviews ,especially surrounding breakfasts and traveller disquiet, but first things first, breakfasts were absolutely brilliant.....I travel a great deal and have experienced hotel breakfasts in many places, but this place is up with the best....Huge selection, yes lot of choice to serve yourself, but the so called "semi buffet ", where you get "main course breakfast" from a set menu....is terrific.....top quality, top service,from really nice.....misused word that....servers.....it was a highlight of the day.Dinner was not cheap .but had really good variety and variation with changes per night. We actually dined there on four successive nights....quality has high, service a little slow....but patience on a vacation is no real problem. Servers were genuinely pleasant and interested in you. Ask and we received!!!We look forward to a return visit
5
Great selection of delicious western and local food in the mid-range price bracket. Very near to many Hotels like Grand Mercury, Indigo and Holiday Inn Express
5
I was worried what we would experience after reading recent reviews however the service was excellent!! We asked for Peranakan food and loved every dish especially the Barramundi and the chicken and black nut. We enjoyed our chat with the chef after dinner as he explained how the chicken dish was cooked. Thank you for such an enjoyable dining experience! We will return
2
The evening started positively when we were welcomed to our seat. It quickly turned negative but more about that later.Let me first comment about the food. Some of the dishes were quite good, particularly the fish. What was very disappointing was the Beef Short Ribs Rendang; it was tough & stringy. What they did right was to not charge us for it.Other than the manager, the service was appalling. We ordered two portions for most of our dishes as we were quite a large party. The server just placed the two portions at the same place on the table. You would think he would place it in the centre of the table. No! He just dumped it next to one of us. We had to bring the plates to the middle of the table; one at each side of the long table.What brought the overall rating down a notch was that they served only bottled water at $7 each. In a country where water from the tap is potable, this is obvious profiteering. And this practice seems to be increasing at more & more restaurants. Only when we the customers stop patronising such restaurants will this practice stop.They will only understand the stupidity of making a small profit from the paid water compared to gaining the long term loyalty of their customers when it hits their bottom line. So give such restaurants a miss. There are many other wonderful restaurants to try in Singapore where water if free
1
Dun go if u are looking for real peranakan food. Dun go unless u wan pay $10 for water. Took away my food even before I finished. Stingray bland n tough. Laksa too dry had to ask for extra gravy. Cheerful staff but not goid enuf to make me go back again. Overpriced. Not worth the money.
3
The food we ordered was good, tasty and well-cooked. This was our fourth visit. However, when we asked for a cup of warm water, we were told we had to buy a bottle of mineral water. This is for my medication I am on.When queried further, we were informed they would heat up the water from the bottle. I was concerned with how hygienic this would be. I feel that situations like this could be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Besides, we asked the same during the breakfast period and we were served warm water by the cup
3
Reservation made via Chope was not picked up by the restaurant. But we did get seated on the high-tables. Service was patchy - a clear shortage of staff. Side plates not provided, staff didn't mention about non-complimentary water and left us wondering why the water glasses were kept empty, and the wines we ordered never arrived. Staff were overall friendly.Food wasn't too bad. Ideal introduction to modern"ish" Peranakan cuisine but definitely catered towards a younger taste bud.1. Crab cakes & chilli crab sauce: Good, sauce could have been thicker and richer.2. XO Crabmeat fried rice: Could have done with a bit more wok-hei.3. Prawn Curry (Udang Masak Lemak): Lemak enough. Prawns were fresh and crunchy but sauce was on a slightly sweeter side.4. Brinjal: Excellent. Slightly smoky and a good sambal that accompanied it. Order this!5. Fried String Beans: Didn't leave much of an impression. For the price, it's a decent restaurant. There are other better Peranakan restaurants at twice the price. Would return and hoping that the service would be improved
3
Decor was nice. Cutlery used was pretty too. However, the food was on the oily side and most were served lukewarm. Eggplant was not fresh and chicken was tough but the fish dish was good. Food was on the pricier side for the relatively smaller portion.
3
The quality of the food was very good but the service was inattentive and needs more improvement . There was 2 tables including mine and waiter would send our orders at wrong time , took a Long time to give us plain rice while the dishes had arrived (had to ask many times), helped to charge handphone n after 1hour went back to collect realised that switchwasn't on . Spoke with the waiter a few time regarding bday surprise and they serve the desert cake as a meal without any candle . Totally Ruined surprise .
4
The food was extremely good and you would not burn a hole in your pocket eating here. However, I was disappointed that they did not serve tap water for dinner and if you want water you have to fork out $7+tax for bottled water. This doesn't sit well with Singaporeans. However, the food is enough to keep me coming back
5
I chose Baba Chews for my boyfriend's birthday celebration based on the reviews I've read. I wasn't disappointed. The staff were friendly and prompt in their service. Food was mostly above average although pricey. I had a staycation at Hotel Indigo and breakfast was served at this restaurant too. The cold dishes were laid out in a semi-buffet and the hot dishes were cooked to order. In addition to what's listed on the menu, they also offer two special dishes every morning. I would go to this restaurant just for their breakfast because it's that good! What a shame I only had two mornings there!On my second morning, I discovered tiny pieces of glass in my muesli. I informed one of the wait staff who promptly informed, whom I believed, the manager. He apologised and reported to me that he would have a word with the chef. He was grim about the matter and I appreciated that. Chewing on glass isn't a joking matter!Nonetheless it hasn't dampened my impression of Baba Chews. Thank you for taking such good care of us! Your staff deserves commendation
4
Good food, good ambience, good service! Only certain dishes were a bit not up to expectations but overall experience was good!
2
I went there for dinner and having tried several similar restaurants, the food was simply average at best. First, the redeeming factors are that the ambience is great and staff are super helpful which is a real plus. However, the food was nondescript; crab cakes were pretty awful twist on chilli crab as they were hard, slightly fishy with little taste. The sambal terong was undercooked and we had to send it back. Chicken for $17 was the only item that was fine but definitely not great. The food is definitely pricey and there is an expectation of better food. To add to the pain, it is just awful that they would charge you $7 for water. It is highly unlikely I will return to this restaurant especially when you are spoilt for choice with great food around that area. Very disappointin
4
It was my first time trying nonya food but the dishes were very flavorful! The only exceptions are that the portion sizes are small and they charged us $7 per bottle of 500ml water. Definitely on the higher price range. However, food was delicious and I'd definitely go back again!
4
The Itek Tim (Duck and salted vegetable soup) was delicious!The Ayam buah keluak (chicken braised in a thick, spicy tamarind gravy with buah keluak nut) was authentic and tasty but the nut stuffing could be better.The Itek Sio (braised tamarind and coriander duck) was way too sweet and the duck was tough like leather!The chendol desert was non-descript
5
We went for brunch on a Saturday. Service at baba chew's was extremely kind. The buffet section was small but full of surprises. I was very impressed by their selection of pastry and the spreads including salty egg kaya and pineapple lemongrass jam. There are also many Malaysian deserts and durian mosse. I would definitely come back again
4
Great breakfast for a small hotel, can't fault. However the team there need to communicate better. I was asked three times what my room number was, by three different staff - when being seated, when placing order and when asking for the bill. When the bill was given to me, of course I still had to write my room number there. I wonder what the point of asking was - clearly they all wanted to know it.
2
The foods is getting worst compared to the earlier opening period. Went there for 3 times. Unlikely would patronize
4
The service crew team is a gem. We were served by Ha Jin and she was attentive to customers. The food here is good enough and the coffee is good. Very pleasant breakfast experience. The half buffet cost $25-$28. Outdoor seating is available. Overall ambience is serene and relaxed.
3
This place have very nice ambience and good service.Food is quite ok. However I have big concern over the freshness of their food as when I was there for dinner, only 3 tables were occupied during the entire dinner...
4
Baba Chews offers an interesting mix of western and local dishes. Since they are part of Hotel Indigo, there is a peranakan flavour to the decor and the menu. We were there for the Peranakan brunch and had previously tried the breakfast when we stayed at Hotel Indigo. The food definite does not disappoint, and in fact offers something different to the usual western fare. I especially liked how they have slightly modernised the Peranakan dishes, but yet retaining the essential flavour of the original dish. They also have creativity in having nasi lemak maki and otah sushi amongst others. For dessert, the durian mousse and goreng pisang (fried banana) is a must try. Peranakan Buffet is available on weekends and public holidays.We chanced upon the dinner menu and have to say it looks very tempting and we can't wait to return and try their version of ayam buah keluak, bak wan kepeting and chap chye
5
1st time there and def will go there again! The food are not very spicy so even children can eat. The durian kueh dessert is fantastic and a must have.
5
Beautifully setup and designed restaurant. What more with great company and food to match! Well done! Will recommend!
5
We had Bircher muesli and the waffles for breakfast. Quick fast friendly service byRosaniza our waitress. Yummy food. Quick mention that although portion size was small it was perfect for me. Location was beside our hotel Indigo and we could of had the breakfast option for $24.00 if booked night before. Which included everything. Fantastic selection of fruit, muesli, cooked breakfast. Very cool decor and nice and clean.Great start to our day
5
Great variety of breakfast food with very attentive staff. I loved breakfast here. There was such a range with new specials every day. It really is a great little place and I wish I had been able to go there for dinner as anyone staying in hotel indigo get 20 percent off...
5
The food served were delicious. It is Peranakan cuisine with a western twist. There are western mains available too. I must say that I loved the service. Waitresses were aware of the orders of customers and were able to advise when asked about the arrival of their food
3
Firstly, my reservation through Chope was missed and I got 3 small round tables joined together which made it hard to share food. I expected more from the food. It was pricey but average. Chicken rice was $17 and really below average. The Peranakan dishes were ok but just expected more because of the price
3
Was my first time there with my colleagues, love the decor and ambience of the restaurant. The manager and staffs serving us were attentive, polite and excellent with customer service.Food presented attractively but the portion is small for the paying price. We had some desserts too but not so fantastic.Overall is on average, however is a nice cosy place to dine in if you have overseas visitors/friends
3
The restaurant is in a great location right on the East Coast road as part of the Katong square complex.The interior is done up quite well a mix of old Peranakan and modern touches.Just average food however, and although the service was perfectly fine, I can only give this place 3 stars because of the food.There are many Peranakan hawker and lower end restaurants in Singapore that have better Peranakan food
4
The Penang fried Kway Teow and Crab cake was very nice. Only service was a bit not very well trained..my drink was sparkling water but they refilled with normal ice water.
5
We couldn't help but notice that the staff serving us was attentive, polite and excellent with customer service. Several times, she overheard comments we made and made the effort to address any issues (not that they were major issues) that we might have. She was pleasant and friendly, and took the extra step to ensure that we enjoyed our meal at the restaurant. I didn't get her name, but she was tall, had long hair tied up and wore spectacles. I must say that all the staff we encountered there were friendly and provided good service, but this lady in particular stood out!Decor and finishings in the restaurant was quite attractive, with a lot of attention given to details. At one point, I looked up and noticed the beautiful metal molded Peranakan pattern on the ceiling, and the Peranakan print was everywhere, from the back of the drink coasters to the soft fabric on the menu covers. For food, most of it was appetising and presented attractively. My favourite was the Beef Short Ribs Rendang. Price was a bit on the higher side though, so not your typical family Peranakan restaurant
4
Restaurant with great ambiance, taste wise a little strong as it is following the traditional "Baba" ethnicity cooking style. service wise is a 9 over 10. Not really a place for budget diner. 非常好的环境但享受的是偏重口味的娘惹菜。服务周到。价格偏高。
4
Went for family Dinner over the weekend. Portion was a little small but overall food was good! More suited for adult dining.
5
Wonderful restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great and kind service and a very nice bar. Serves delicious food from both asian and western kitchen

Baba Chews is part of the Indigo hotel in Katong/Joo Chiat and located inside the old Joo Chiat Police Station, not far from Katong i12.. I have been several times to Baba Chews (including pre-opening) for the weekend brunch, and have never been disappointed once. The western-style brunch (pancake, egg benedict and variations) are all reliable staples, but the self-service corner - which by the way is nicely decorated - always has a surprise or two to make you come back: large choice of home-made (I think) yogurts, freshly-squeezed fruit juices, good bread and danish, smoked fish, several cheese, salad items and at least 6 fruit choices... Teas are from TWG, served in nice tea pots, so you cannot go wrong with these either. Friends have had mixed reviews about the Peranakan food; I never tried it myself. Kids above 6 are half price (free below) and always find "too many good things to eat" (in their own words). Weekend brunch is good value for money and it is never full, which means it is a good place to chit-chat with friends for a relaxed 2 hours, especially if it rains outside... Keep it up

I would give zero if there is such a choice. Not sure if it is because breakfast was part of the room package, there seemed to be NO service in this place. Plates were uncleared (start to finish), a simple coffee took half an hour to arrive, and reminders ignored or they simply didn't bother. (maybe they hope you won't remember?)Will NOT recommend a place like this. Any customer that walk in IS a customer (paying or not). The management should train their staffs on this basic customer service fundamental.A wonderful hotel with a before par breakfast service

We received excellent service and enjoyed several of their offerings over 3 days of having breakfast here while staying at the Indigo Hotel next door. There is a wide variety of breakfast options including local and international dishes. Thank you for looking after us each day

Wow, the staff here won me over. The service was way better than the good. They even thanked me for finishing my plate of food. I ate the Beef short rib rendang as recommended by the staff and I loved it. I highly recommend it.The ambience is great and it's a restaurant I would keep going back to over and iver again if I lived in Singapore

Great food. Nice ambience. Attentive staff. GM offered to take us for a tour of hotel facilities and decor. Will be back!

Friendly welcome by staff . Right in the heart of Katong . Cosy vibe , more like a bar than a restaurant . But I like it ! Food is good - we had sambal stingray and ngoh Hiang . Leave room for durian crepes !!. Will be back again 
4
We had a really tasty meal in this restaurant - flavors are strong and delicious. The service is not as good as the food which is unfortunate - nobody was responsible for our table and several waiters asked us the same questions
4
Food is generally good but a bit salty on some dishes. Atmosphere is nostalgic and service is excellent. The downside is staff sweeping the floor when diners are eating

Recently had dinner with my parents on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is located right in front of the new Hotel Indigo, by the main road. The restaurant is very tastefully decorated with dark overtones and is a nice blend of traditional and modern design.This is a popular restaurant and I'm glad we made advance reservations as it was quite full on the Saturday night that we visited. For a party of 3, we ordered an appetiser (trio of Otah), a soup (Pong Tauhu), 3 main dishes (Pork Rib Pongteh, Ayam Buah Keluak and Nonya Chap Chye) accompanied with white rice.Even though the restaurant was near capacity, the dishes arrived quite quickly. The quality of the food is good but we didn't find them to be particularly memorable especially for the price. The 2 meat dishes were decent but we felt that they were not piping hot and this seemed to have affected the flavour of the food. The soup (Pong Tauhu) was very good though - the stock very rich and the meatballs flavourful and generous with ingredients.There aren't many Peranakan restaurants in Singapore and while I wouldn't say this was a bad dinner in any way at all, I would say it's only above average. The somewhat pricey dishes could have been another factor that didn't help to manage our expectations

The ambience was great, service was quick (i'm not sure if that is because we went at a lull period), decor was pretty and the air-conditioning was good. Found the selection for Happy Hour very limited, and we did try one of their cocktails but it was lacking the oomph - could barely taste any alcohol. The bar snacks were alright, the fries yummy with sambal on the side, but the chilli crabcakes were disappointing. We had the jackfruit cheesecake as well, this was delicious! I think even as a restaurant, they could offer more HH promotions especially in a hip place in the east like Katong

The Nonya cuisine in Singapore is distinctive to the region and not to be missed when traveling to this part of the world. Housed within the former Joo Chiat Police Station in the historic Katong Square, this area is already known for its heritage shophouses and fun, chic vibe. Be sure to try the Ayam Buah Keluak (Asian truffle) which a traditional Peranakan chicken stew dish made with keluak black nut which is rich and oily, and bears a taste resemblance to a smoky mushroom or strong- flavoured truffles.

Outstanding value for money at $28++... top quality food, friendly service and a great variety to choose fro
5
We had breakfast included with our stay at Hotel Indigo Katong, and the breakfasts were amazing! The staff are young and enthusiastic and very keen to please. The quality and quantity of the food is very high. The venue can be a little crowded at times but outside seating gives more room
4
Located in the Indigo Hotel in Kantong, the food certainly is good but a bit overpriced. Hotel restaurants usually are over priced compared to independent restaurants and eateries. Good service
5
We went there specifically to try the Pernankan dishes. Week day night and the place filled up by 8.30 pm. Recommend reservations if you're a bigger group. We had nyonya favorites Pork Pongteh, Beef Rendang among others. Reminded us of dished we had at our grandfather's home when we were kids. Very good. Highly recommende

Baba Chews is a modern eatery, with very tasteful decor, mixing Nonya and Western styles to create a lovely ambience. All dishes were delicious but I suspect are not in keeping with traditional recipes, as I feel the reason I found the dishes delicious, is because all dishes were more sweet than spicy. The portions are smaller than you would find at other Singapore restaurants.The restaurant has a good wine selection, though I would recommend you take the tasting of the wine seriously to ensure the wine is in perfect condition.Read the first page of the menu as it gives an interesting background of Baba Chew and Joo Chiat.The space is versatile, as it would be good for romantic dinners, business lunches and larger gatherings

Falling in love with peranakan cuisine after this meal at Baba Chews. Great quality, great chef and friendly waitresses who served us. Thumbs u

Thanks for bringing back the fund memory of my grandma's nyonya kitchen, albeit the creative modern surprising twists :-)

Restaurant setting was nice, with lovely tiles and old-time charm.Food and service were however disappointing. The rendang was OK but too sweet. The buah kluak dish was flat and had no distinctive factor. The curry fish head was very average. And all the other dishes were at best mediocre and certainly too pricey for the quality we got. The chendol was extremely disappointing, and the bubor terigu was only slightly better. Only the durian dessert was good. We had a reservation made. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a waiter who didn't appear happy to receive us. Service was slow. In the omelette dish, one of the youngsters bit into a shell that was about 1/2 cm in diameter. (Fortunately, the young man who discovered the shell had strong teeth...an older person may have just cracked his or her tooth!). We brought it up to one of the waiters who quietly apologised (almost just in passing). They replaced the dish but made no further mention of the incident.If you want to have a decently nice place to leisurely sit with friends to chat but are not fussy about food, maybe Baba Chews is OK. But if you are looking for authentic peranakan food, this may not be the best choice

The variety of food items in the menu was interesting, as they featured some of their own recommended chef creations. The surprise in our main course was the wild butter rice, which was very moist, though it could have done with slightly less butter. The chap chye and ngoh hiang were tasty, and so was the ayam buah keluak! The best part of the dinner was the Banana Cake, which was a wonderful combination of moist banana cake topped with coconut cream, and some banana slices on the side. That made my journey to the east worth it

Came here for dinner with my sister and her husband as they live just across the road. We ordered 4 dishes with soup, and the portions was just nice for 4 of us and my toddler boy. The dishes, while tasted local and quite home cooked, were too toned down. Rendang and Sambal Udang didn't taste spicy at all. Chap Chye was forgettable. Pong Tauhu was decent. The Ayam Buah Keluak was the greatest disappointment, as I felt that the nuts were dry and had a bitter aftertaste. Spent close to $120 including a beer. In summary, it's great introduction to local food for a tourist (bring your tourist friend here for a Peranakan food 101), but probably better to go somewhere else in Joo Chiat for real peranakan food. Try the Birds of Paradise gelato opposite for dessert

An awesome breakfast at Baba Chews. If your staying at the Hotel Indigo this is the place for breakfast. Its certainly worth the money. The Coffee is excellent

Breakfast, January 2017.Upon checking in to the Hotel Indigo next door, it was suggested I have a "buffet breakfast" at Baba Chews. I proceeded at around 9 where my room number was taken and I was allocated a seat. I did find the staff warm and welcoming, however the tables are positioned extremely close which makes visiting the "food pantry" prone with the risk of knocking items off the next table.Either way, the buffet spread had a limited, although quite adequate, selection of hot and cold items from various cultures and regions. Salmon, toast, cereal, congee, rotti and pastries all included.To my surprise there was a limited amount of "American" hot food items ready to eat. No bacon?! Instead, you're provided with an ala carte menu to order from. This is where my experience at Baba Chews fell a but short. Firstly I was confused as I considered this being separate to the buffet (I.e., extra charges) and it wasn't really clarified, but I went ahead and ordered eggs with the lot. Coming and going to the set buffet whilst I waited for my order, about 40 minutes passed and I hadn't received the ala carte order. It wasn't until the waitress approached everyone to advise "last orders" on the ala carte menu, I assumed they'd forgotten the previous order so simply requested the same thing again. This was my last chance as the cook to order menu finishes at 10:00, half an hour prior to breakfast closing. Sure enough, just prior to 10, my order arrived.. Two farm fresh eggs cooked to my style.. However, the rest of the accompanying order was nowhere to be found! No bacon for me today, I suppose. With everything closed at 10:23am I conceded defeat. The food is nice (when you receive it) however I won't be returning

Friends invited us for weekend brunch and heard about good reviews on Hotel Indigo's Baba Chews. Location is accessible and ambience is cozy! We grabbed the all day breakfast and it was worth the money. Price is really reasonable for the offer plus great service was provided by Carmina who looked after us during our visit. Loved their eggs benedict and really fluffy pancakes! Will come back to try their local highlights! 
5
I really wanted to try the traditional Kaya toast while in Singapore, but wanted to let others have a more of a choice for breakfast. Three of us ended up having the Kaya toast, another had an omlette and the other had hot cereal. With freshly squeezed watermelon juice, I couldn't have had a more delicious breakfast. Everyone else also enjoyed their food. The service was also very good

Restaurant decor is peranakan meets high glamour. There's a bar section you can sit at as well. We didn't have any reservations on a Sunday evening at 8pm, and were shown to a table quickly. I found the tables we were seated at a tad too low, guess it's for elderly customers? The wait staff were pleasant and prompt, especially the Indian lady who recommended the chicken satay to us. The chicken was cooked to perfection and heavenly when dipped in the peanut sauce. I loved the sauce so much I ate it with the plain rice and my partner copied me. If only the way of serving satay was less hipster, as it was served in a metal basket that's usually used for fries. We completely over looked the rice, cucumber and onion cubes hidden below the satay until we had finished the chicken.We also had itek sio (braised duck leg) which could possibly have a bit more tamarind. But it's a personal preference. The chap chye was so so in quality. Food prices are slightly above average. Overall it's a pleasant place. I will return if there's a chance to try other dishes
5
Had a super stay at Indigo and particularly enjoyed the service and breakfast at this restaurant. The manager was particularly friendly and the eggs benedict was spectacular
5
Baba chews offers paranakan and western food. Overall not bad, ambience very cosy too. Staff are very friendly and good. Overall, a nice feel to it. Definitely be back. Their breakfast are great too!
5
Called in on the off chance for a light bite. Made very welcome. All the staff were extremely polite and well dressed.Our party of four had a variety of food. Personally I opted for Crispy Belly Pork in a rich sauce. Well presented and tasty. My other guests were also very impressed with the service and quality of their food. The bottle Heineken was 11 Sing Dollars plus tax and 10% service charge.Give Baba Chews a try, you will be pleasantly surprised

We had breakfast at Baba Chews and we really enjoyed. There are many choices from eggs, omelettes, soups orders to the buffet part where you can find fruits, milk, yoghurts, juices. We really loved salmon and cheese. All the food was delicious. Omelettes are quite big and tasty. The orders came very fast and the staff were fery friendly and helpful. The decoration is really beautiful and colorful. If you are staying at Hotel Indigo Katong you can go there for breakfast but if not the visit is worth. After breakfast the neighborhood is nice to walk around
4
Reasonable wine choices / great spread of local food choices to complement the location; whilst a little on the pricier end; good enough for the one tim
5
Great meals with good service. We had both breakfast and dinner at this venue and thoroughly enjoyed both. Breakfast is a varied selection of cold buffet items, with hot dishes made to order. Food was well presented and served by knowledgeable wait staff. At dinner, having a choice between local Singaporean Peranakan favourites, or western, suited all tastes. Highly recommended

If you are deciding whether to have local delights or English Breakfast for you Brunch, BaBa Chew is the right place for you. I just went for my 3rd Stay @ Hotel Indigo for my birthday retreat and decided to opt in for the buffet during my hotel reservation as this was high recommended by the staffs, fyi I have dine twice at BaBa Chew during lunch , their peranankan food was awesome. Im a frequent staycay person, Most of the time I will SKIP Breakfast in SG Hotels because their breakfast spread are most of the time of a disappointment as compared to elsewhere. Let's minus off those 5 to 6 stars luxury hotels and say in general for 3 to 4 stars in general. The buffet spread are limited, you see repetition of the same style of food and they are not fantastic. At BaBa Chew, what they offer are really of more than value of their quality of food and drinks. They served semi Ala-Carte Breakfast Style buffet, meaning there are actually a list of breakfast menu from Big Breakfast , Egg Bennys, Waffles , French toast , Congee and Noddles for you to choose from.Forget about Q-ing @ the egg stations just to get your double sunny side up, here you can customise your breakfast, just like any cafe that serve brunch! We Singaporeans are "Kia-Su" when is Buffet!!!! The question often raise to the staff: Can we order more than one? Answer is .. Yes you can!! UNLIMITED Orders, cooked upon order isn't it better? Serve to your table right in a pan. They do have a mini buffet spread that you can help yourself with Bread toast Sourdough , crossiants and others, They serve salads where you can help you in the fridge just like home, Lots of condiment spread from nutella, peanut butter , jams and butter and marmite! They have steam dim sum and also pastries to ease your sweettooth cravings. Their signature latte is something worth drinking and they do serve you a "pineapple" shot to go with it before the coffee. Price for the buffet is below $30 for breakfast if you are dining in as public, for guest I topped up about $21 for 2 pax which I opt in during my booking. This is indeed why I love coming back to Hotel Indigo and BaBa Chew, Great Food Great People! Thums Up! Will definitely bring my friends here again

Good service. Pity about the food. If you're familiar with good peranakan food, you'll be disappointed. Diluted thin tasting ayam (chicken) buah keluak, so-so itek (duck), and the twist on a chilli crab cake that was served with a mantou cracker that almost broke Mom's teeth. The sambal improved many a dish.
5
I went here with my Wife and experienced the most amazing local cuisine, but with a slightly western twist. The service was excellent, with staff only too willing to tell us about the history of the place - and history it's got. I can only recommend this place to business people entertaining, gentlemen treating their wife's or friends enjoying each other company
5
The restaurant was busy but I was seated quickly and received excellent service. I tried the crab cakes. They were deep fried and very good. I ordered the beef rendang. It was very tender and very tasty. If you are staying at the Hotel Indigo or Holiday Inn Express, you can bill it to the room. Because it was busy, it was also very loud and noisy. But I enjoyed the food very much and would return

had dinner there, 2 Sat ago. luckily we did a reservation cos the place was full at about 7.30pm.we had food from their peranakan menu - beef rendang, udang in coconut gravy, seabass in special sambal sauce, iteh sio etc. yummy food.cosy and nice ambience.had dessert too - cendol, teh tarek ice cream, nangka cheesecake. wanted to try the gula melaka ice cream but it was not available that nite.overall a nice experienc
3
Breakfast supply one by one per person not a buffet style which was good for me. Also it's very good feeling that soft drink and juices are stored at refrigerator.
5
Absolutely love this restaurant been a couple of time, great decor, service & food which is rare in SG these days... The crab cakes are fantastic and try the beef randang! Will be back

Confused menu that needs refinement. This eatery serves Hotel Indigo so they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and brunch on weekends. Lunch sets are not available on weekends (the Babi ponteh was melt in your mouth good but not available in the menu but only in the weekday lunch set). This was my second visit and we aimed for the Peranakan dishes but found insufficient dishes to make a complete meal. We ordered Beef rib rendang (so tender but second visit was too sweet), sambal stingray, otak trio (the family didn't think much of it), crab cakes (I really enjoyed. It was a deconstructed chilli crab with fresh sweet moist crispy crab cakes), char kway teow was good (looked pale but lots of 'wok hei'. The Asian style beef salad was good (tasted better second time round.) Specials on the board were not available - Assam prawns was on the board but not available for lunch but dinner . Sigh. (Then why bother having it up on the board as a special). Complimentary crackers (tasted fresher second time round). Hope they iron out consistency issue.If you are laughing at this stage, it's probably because you noticed we only managed to order two peranakan dishes. They did have a peranakan-inspired burger but no takers from our group. Still I think my family enjoyed the experience in this sparkly new-ish eatery with mod peranakan-inspired laid back ambience.Determined to complete the dining experience, we had the teh tarik ice cream and gula melaka ice cream. The young ones preferred the gula melaka while I preferred the teh tarik.On my first visit, we spent time admiring the menu, place mats, cloth napkins, deco... So much thought. During the second visit, they gave us cocktail paper serviettes. They ran out of napkins during the lunch service and we arrived early too. Ah yo.Overall, I enjoyed the crab cakes, rendang, salad and teh tarik ice cream. Would love another rendezvous with the ponteh

We visited Baba Chews for dinner on a Sunday night and were not disappointed. The food - we tried local dishes- is excellent and portions big, service is good. The decor is lovely and the tables are arranged in a way that they are far enough from each other so that diners have enough privacy - which is often not the case in restaurants.Only reason why I do not rate this 5 stars: drinks are expensive, especially the cocktails are seriously overpriced for the Katong area
2
We visited Baba Chews on Sunday, 25th Sep 2016 for Brunch around 11 am.We didn't have a reservation and just walked in. We were told that all the tables were reserved till 12.30 pm when we could see only a single table occupied. The whole place was practically empty. We came back later around 11.30 am to check, and it was suggested that they can merge 2 tables to give us a table. We left the place around 1 pm, but none of the reserved tables were occupied. And only 2-3 tables were occupied.The food was good and the service otherwise was ok
5
First class local dishes freshly prepared , staff friendly and hopeful to explain , what all the dishes are , great bar staff Thomas makes of the best cocktails in Singapore some of them are his signature cocktails

We stayed at Hotel Indigo Katong in our August trip in the merlion city. Every day we were filled to the brim and didn't have a chance to try the hotel restaurant, Baba Chews. On our 2nd last night we had an early dinner so we decided to check out the restaurant. The deco ties in well with the hotel's peranakan theme.We ordered 2 desserts - cendol and sour plum ice. They were unexpectedly nice. The coconut and palm sugar were well balanced in the cendol. The sour plum ice fondly reminded us of a plum candy we ate when we were kids. Such a sweet finale to our day.Service was friendly and efficient. Will sure go back to try other dishes when we next visit Singapore.
3
Thought we could offer friends visiting with a truly authentic Peranakan lunch but was greatly disappointed as the eatery only served a limited menu among other light food. The staff informed us that the dinner spread offers more Peranakan food. We had to settle for Babi Pongteh set, kueh pie ti, tauhu goreng, otak, Bak Wan kepeting soup & fried kueh Teow instead. Food was averagy but service and ambience were friendly and good. However, the second serving of the soup tasted different & more diluted! Try to do a dinner if you are around the area and hopefully you can get a decent Peranakan meal
4
Being the 1st time here together with the hub, it left us nice impression, nice food and a simple peranakan ambience. The staffs were friendly and attentive too. The hub ordered few dishes for sharing:1. Kueh Pie Tee - nice tall crisp crust with self help fillings 2. Nonya chap cai - pungent home styled taste3. Ngoh Hiang - yummy crisp thin skin with nice fillings 4. Otah Trio - 5. Crab fried rice Fruits-infuse water was served. A complimentary peranakan crackers was served with sambal sauce.Overall, we like the food served at Baba Chews Katong

I went Baba Chew dine twice right check out at Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong. Baba Chew was a restaurant under Hotel indigo but yet open to all hotel guest and public diners. Recommended dishes were invented by celebrity chef Sam leong!The 1st time I visited Baba Chew I ordered their Nyonya Fried Rice and Laksa! The portion was decent. Could taste the "wok hei" (cooked from wok) from the rice. Laksa was not very spicy yet not too coconuty but coming from e review from traditional Nyonya Laksa is not meant to be very spicy like e normal Laksa. 2nd visit , I tried Beef Rendang and Grill lemongrass Pork Chop recommended by Chef Alvin leong as I wanted to eat Penang Fried Kwan Teow they ran out. The Beef Rendang meat was so tender and tasted like pulled pork, but find e sauce a little sweet, could be better if it's a slight more spicy. Lemongrass pork chop was grilled to perfection keeping the meat juicy and tender to chew on. I must say the food is of quality and service rendered by the Chef was impressive. Would bring friends and family back to dine again !
