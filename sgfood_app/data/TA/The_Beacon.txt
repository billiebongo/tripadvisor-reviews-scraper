Been here a few times this year for drinks after work. It's usually a fairly popular bar midweek and has some decent happy hour offerings. I like the Erdinger here. Service can be a bit random but otherwise it's fine.

Relaxed atmosphere, live music, decent food and attentive staff. Alcohol is very expensive in Singapore so we enjoyed the all night Happy Hour prices on a Wednesday evening. Other offers apply on different nights.

Service was ok. Staff was really prompt. Standard beers. Good music. Pretty chill to go here and have a couple of drinks before going to clubs.

This is a good choice for a few beers after work if you're trying to avoid a savage gouging. The 1:1 happy hour on the Erdinger is a decent deal. Unfortunately there's no dark Erdinger, but hey. The regular Erdinger is still one of the better mass market beers to choose from

Came here for food and drinks with friends. The one for one was a fabulous deal- the food choices were limited but enjoyed the drumlets though serving portion was small and Parma ham pizza. Waitstaff were attentive and patient. Band music was lovely, neither too noisy nor crowded on a Thursday evening

Service is so slow and horrible. Staff are inattentive. Beyond imagination. The manager is unable to handle complaint at all. All he can say is 'I will let the management know'. Drinks takes 10 to 20min to arrive EACH AND EVERY TIME. Pizza took 45min to come. If you are having 1 for 1, staff will only come clear your glass, they will not ask if you want the other glass to be served, you MUST ask for it. Even if your table is completely empty! There are other places for drinks nearby. Go anywhere else.

Our office is just next building, we went there for team drinks. Bar attendants were so not welcoming, showed us a table with extremely sad face. We thought may be that attendant had a bad day, but apparently another 2 attendants were equally lousy. Before we finished giving order, they are in rush to go away. Along with drinks we ordered Nachos which took more than 30 mins to serve that to after several reminders. This place is in my top list for worst services. No need to say, I will not go back again

Friday night- Oysters! Served without cocktail sauce, asked for it - they don't have!! Group of 5- 3 paid with credit cards took 15 minutes to clear the bill- get gps EDC machines that waiters can take to the tables- this way they don't bring you the wrong CCard

We were staying at the nearby Marina Mandarin Hotel.Having been out sightseeing we were in need of a drink, something to eat and a place to chill. The Beacon provided just the right place.The Beacon's open frontage made sitting inside listening to a live band on a lovely warm evening very pleasant. Service from the moment we arrived until we left was outstanding and with a smile. In fact we enjoyed it so much we returned the next evening.The bar was busy and the band fantastic but what was slightly surreal was the fact that aside from us and one other couple applauding at the end of songs, no one seemed to acknowledge or show their appreciation for them; they deserved recognition.I can recommend visiting The Beacon

I find this place on my way back to the hotel I stayed at marina mandarin hotel , The prices in Singapore are very high also for alcohol , I ordered cocktail (18 Singapore dollar) And potatoes (6 Singapore dollar) big portion It was nice They have live shows but I think it's too loud because you cannot hear anyone near you . But nice place to stop to have a drink

After a longish first day in Singapore finding our feet we needed food and drink and visited the Beacon. The menu is very limited and basic and simply overpriced. Don't think I would visit again!

Ambience was good, situated opposite Suntec City convention centre. Live bands on weekends, had a great time there with friends. Got to try their Draft Archipelago Craft Beer, it's good. Will swing by again

We came here for the one for one beers and stayed a bit longer because the music was pretty good. Looked at the food on offer but did not find anything we fancied on the menu so when around the corner to a Japanese restaurant.

Great place to go for after work drinks with the happy hours deal on wednesday. Good band and overall excellent value for money!

We had a very good time at The Beacon Restaurant and Bar in the middle of Singapore. The food was good, the drinks everything you wanted them to be, and the service both friendly and knowledgeable. Relatively expensive, but very comfortable and worth it.

...the atmosphere is actually quite good especially while the band is playing live but the service is quite terrible. Just the band save them the third star....could be more maybe we hit a bad day. :/

Was there for a Muay Thai events.Tickets includes "complimentary drink".On the events day itself, was told at the entrance that it is redeemable after the events.However, after the events end at 10.30pm, we were told that it is redeemable after MIDNIGHT !A whole group of us over 15 pax end up throwing away the so called "complimentary" drinks coupons.Horrible cheating events host

Staying at the almost adjacent Marina Mandarin we (3) were walking past around 9pm and decided to round off a long hot day of sightseeing with a cold beer. It was 2 for 1 Monday so 2 beers were $18 and pizza was also 2 for 1. Pizza was fresh made thin crust perfect with the beer. 6 Tiger pints and 4 12 inch pizza was $115.89There was a singer and guitarist who were very good, and they also have a DJIf we had another evening we would probably gone back again, they have different offers every day, and we also were happy to catch up with some sports results from home on the TV, glad to say it was on mute so didn't interfere with the music

Came here for a few beers after work last week and was pleasantly surprised to see 1:1 Erdinger. Food was pretty uninspiring but the beers were decent. A little annoying that people were smoking (since the whole area is technically under cover) but otherwise all was good. Service was efficient albeit a little disinterested

I was at The Beacon on a Tuesday Night to hang out with my colleagues. It is a pretty decent place to have some beer and snacks. I ordered chicken wings and calamari rings and it tasted too salty. However, the Happy Hour was a crowd puller plus it was a rainy night so it works perfectly well
