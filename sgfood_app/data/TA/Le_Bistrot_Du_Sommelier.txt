We went their for the French cheese, it was really nice (even though quite expensive - 49 sgd for a mont d'or). The duck rillettes was delicious and the dessert too !

Duck Rillettes for appetizer was good.
Steak & Frites and the Braised beef cheek was awesome.
Souffl√© for dessert was the perfect ending.
Good wines also.
