Cheap but good Thai food. Dishes like Thai mango salads , Fish cakes and Thai beef soup are good dishes, although a little sweet and salty.

Was in Singapore on business and came to this restaurant with a group of my colleagues. The food was delightful. I ordered a coconut curry seafood and it just melted in my mouth.
Highly recommended.

Supposedly to be authentic but to my dismay, its not at all.The tom tum soup broth was way too sour for anyone to consume and the prawns used was either over cooked or not fresh. The pad thai was also bland and slightly soggy.The pineapple rice was so-so and nothing to shout about.The stir fried kang kong was too salty.The steam fish was also not fresh and to cook used too much lime slices to try to cover the smell of the fish and the texture of the meat was also too soft.Saving grace was that the fried chicken was good.The thai milk tea was ok.Looks like the place is also under staffed as orders took quite long to come and there were quite a few irritable guests whom raised their voice to get attention and the servers weren't paying attention to their guests' needs. I saw a guest had raised a commotion to one of the servers at the counter complaining about the lack of service to the guests seated outside of the restaurant.For a few dishes called and the price was quite pricey. This place needs a major overhaul of staff and the food quality control

Went for lunch today and my Mother and I both had the set lunch meal. We ordered a papaya salad, a mango salad, pad thai and green curry. I thoroughly enjoyed the hearty Thai meal and was surprised at the flavours of every dish. Everything was made to perfection. The ambience is not perfect but the food surely is. The waitresses were lovely and were very accommodating as we both needed the dishes switched to vegetarian. DO NOT order the Thai Ice tea, it's basically tea flavoured cold sugar syrup and too sweet

Mai Thai Restaurant located at 44 Jalan Merah Saga, Singapore, , its clean and modern... serving authentic Thai dishes, The food tastes great and is made from quality ingredients, I enjoyed all the food that we tried they were outstanding such as prawn cakes, the beef shank in broth, olive rice, Penang chicken curry and prawn floss salad but the Pad Thai stood out they were outstanding .You could say that it’s one of the Best Thai Food in Singapore The pricing is definitely higher than average but I guess you are paying for the quality of the dishes served here. The true highlight of the night was definitely the food, it was absolute perfect. Big plus also go to the Staff, very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Thai cuisine. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon

I’m probably being a little harsh with 4 rather than 5 because the main courses (we both had the Rendang - one beef, one veggie) were excellent.The only down side was that my spring rolls were very greasy, maybe the oil they were fried in just wasn’t hot enough.My wife had the fried tofu to start and said that although it didn’t look the best it tasted very good with the sauce.Service was excellent and the price was very reasonable

Located in Holland Village within walking distance of the Circle Line (MRT), amidst specialty stores, nice cafes & restaurants, is Mail Thai, a restaurant with a lovely ambience serving authentic Thai cuisine!Had lunch with 3 friends, one of whom is a vegetarian, and we were extremely satisfied with the food and service:Papaya salad, Morning glory and Padthai were modifiedto "vegetarian" without losing any of the tastes!Clear winners were the Seafood Tomyum soup, Green chicken curry and Olive ric

Was my first time to visit this authentic restaurant as their staff speak Thai. We opt for the lunch deal. Really valued for money as they have options to choose from appetizer, main course, dessert of the day and a cold beverage. Staff were friendly. We will patronize this restaurant again.

Visited recently with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed the food. We had a delicious mango salad that was very refreshing but also had a bit of a kick. The extra spicy tom yum had the kick of a mule but was delicious with shrimp poached to perfection in the spicy broth. We then had the steamed sea bass which was also delicious accompanied by mixed vegetables which were beautifully crunchy. All washed down with a decent bottle of reasonably priced (well for Singapore) Chablis.Sadly the restaurant wasn't very busy on the night we visited and the service was just OK. Also all of the dishes were served more or less at once and it would have been better to have those spaced out better. Still, a very pleasant evening with good food

While shopping in the area of Chip Bee Gardens, which is opposite Holland Village, we stepped into Mai Thai Restaurant for a quick dinner. We have eaten here a couple of times before in the past, and found the food and service quite satisfactory.Being a week day night, the place was not crowded, only three or four tables were occupied. There is an outdoor as well as indoor dining area. The lighting is adequate with a warm and cosy ambiance. The inside dining area can be very noisy as the acoustics is bad. There’s piped Thai music. Service was good, being attentive, but the food took a long while to appear as the restaurant was processing take aways in plastic packages for a courier from some food delivery service. I noticed that they had just one waiter and one waitress, who doubled up as a cashier, that night.We ordered the Mango Salad; Green Curry Chicken and Stir-fried Mixed Vegetables and a small Heineken. The mango salad had shredded young green mango mixed with sliced onions and cherry tomatoes in a dressing of lime, sweetened with sugar. The topping was baby shrimps and roasted peanuts. I found the peanuts soft and not crunchy, but generally the salad was refreshing. The curry had lots of chicken meat strips in a rather thickish coconut gravy with Thai eggplant. Several elements were missing in the curry which didn’t really make it. The third dish was baby kai-lan, baby corn, carrots, cabbage and mushrooms sautéed in oyster sauce and garlic. Some of the mushrooms I ate were slightly off, I thought, as they had a peculiar smell!In our opinion, the food was only average. We’ve eaten Thai food in Bangkok, Cheng Mai and Cheng Rai, Phuket, Pathong, etc, and although the food at Mai Thai may be “authentic”, it’s still only average. Prices are on the steep side. Our dinner for two cost $66.27 inclusive of tax and service charges. The place is apparently popular over the weekends, so best call in at those times for a reservation.Address:Mai Thai Rstaurant.Blk 44 Jalan Merah Saga#01-58 Chip Bee GardensSingapore 278116Phone: +65 6474-3108Fax: +65 6474-3100Open Daily:Lunch 11:00am - 2:30pmDinner 6:00pm - 10:30pm They have a branch in Seletar

My wife and I dined frequently at this restaurant. Being small eaters, the portions are just right for us. I don't eat poultry and beef so our selections tend to be a bit restrictive. The food are good but a tad too saltish for my wife at times. Reminder works. The place can be crowded during weekdays and there is alfresco dining. Car parking can be a problem but it is 2 minutes walk from Holland Village MRT station

Celebrated a friend's birthday here. All of us enjoyed the food though the green curry was a tad too spicy for some. What stood out was the excellent service by the staff. One of them even cut up the cake we brought to serve all of us. This was a first for me. Since the food is good and the service excellent, I will be back

This is our third time at Mai Thai and it didn't disappoint. We ordered the shin beef curry, which was drenched in sauce and great as usual when eaten with the rice. We also ordered the mixed vegetables, which we also enjoyed, and the mango sticky rice. Though the food is nothing really fantastic, it's tasty and worth a try

Mai Thai is located on a quiet side road in Holland Village. The strange thing I found was that it takes it's last order for lunch fairly early at 13:30.The food in my view is fairly decent.I've tried the standard Papaya salad, Olive rice, Cashew Chicken, Chicken in Penang Curry and Prawn in Green curry.Of these, the salad was really good. Every item was fresh and tasted good. Keep in mind that even the 'mild' version was spicy for us. The olive rice was good as well. The cashew chicken was a bit disappointing as it was too oily. The green curry prawns was ok in that the prawns were fresh but the curry was a bit on the very watery side. The Chicken in Penang curry was a hit.The service was swift and friendly. The staff were willing to accommodate special requests like making the Olive rice without pork or tofu.I'd go here again
