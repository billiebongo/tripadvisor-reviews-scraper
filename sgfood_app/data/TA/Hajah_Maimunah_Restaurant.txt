I came here at 8 am, and I'm satisfied with my breakfast. I'm happy to get halal food and it is a cozy place, not too far from bus station.
5
home cooked kind of dish.. delicious... Always long queue... price for value...
family restaurant.... fast serving... wide choice of menu.... guaranteed satisfaction for those who loves traditional foods...
4
Whether for a snack, a meal or a take away this is the place for old Singaporean Malay dishes. An array of soft drinks, juices and coffee is on offer.
Simple seating, huge crowd and delicious treats.
4
Casual dining , above average quality and variety.Local pricing - slightly more than your regular coffee shop but less than a restaurant.Must try ... Lontong ( steam rice cake with vegetables in coconut milk), Sambal goreng ( bean curd, prawns, Long bean sautÃ© in a slightly spicy sauce ), Ayam Bakar ( BBQ chicken with black sweet sauce seasoning & the Kueh kueh ( local cakes
3
The people who rated this eating place must be non local who do not know the meaning of quality Malay cuisine!Everything they offered are mediocre and nothing Fantastic. In fact some of the signature dishes are nothing compared to nearby Malay eating places.The only outstanding effort is the varieties of dishes offered, spoilt for choice.Look and try other Malay Restaurants nearby and you'll experience better offerings for Malay cuisine

Hajah Maimunah is considered one of the best Halal certified restaurant in Singapore since been around in the 1990s, serving authentic Malay traditional Kampong style delicacies. For westerners, the word â€˜Kampongâ€™ means village in the Malay language. Among Hajah Maimunahâ€™s signature dish will be the Beef Rendang (braised beef), Ikan Bakar (grilled fish), Ayam Bakar Padang (spicy grilled chicken) and Tahu Telur (deep fried egg & bean curd), which are all sought out dishes by both local and international diners. My personal one would be the Beef Rendang and Ayam Bakar Padang. The ingredients are exclusively authentic rich with spices and herbs, and both meat are extremely tender and not too spicy when consumed with the white fragrant jasmine rice. Electrifying tasting I must say!!Altogether there are more than 40 affordable dishes to choose from and prices range from S$4-$6 per dish. Expect an average price per pax at S$10 including beverages.The colorful assorted dishes which are randomly placed on aluminium trays and several decorative plates filled the classy glass cabinet while mesmerizing diners as well as onlookers to decide on their orders.Breakies are also offered apart from lunch and dinner. Hajah Maimunah operates from Monday-Saturday, 7am onwards. Among other recommended dishes to explore are the Ayam Lemak Chilli Padi, Lemak Siput Sedut and Asam Pedas Ikan Pari. For desserts, the Bubur Cha Cha (tapioca assortments cooked with coconut milk), and Odeh-Odeh -a must try sweetener that will make you drool for more but hopefully not increase your sugar level.This establishment has both two dining areas, indoor and outdoor, however, itâ€™s quite squeezed during lunch time while seated indoors. If you intend to dine in big groups, I would suggest to make an early reservation. My overall verdict, 10/10 for itâ€™s food, service and an extra credit for itâ€™s wide variety of food listings to cater all types of diners, meat lovers, seafood enthusiasts, vegetarians and for those health conscious ones

We went to this restaurant by train. We took the blue line train and stop at Jalan Besar Station. Then, we walked about 400 metres for about 7 minutes to go to Jalan Pisang.We arrived at the restaurants at about 1.30pm. The queue wasnt that long but we still have to wait for about 20 minutes for our turn. You have the option to put whatever dishes you want together with your rice or you can have the dishes served separately on different plate. There are plenty of tables available on the 2nd floor (air-conditioned area)I think the food was good. I didnt want to rate Average but for me the restaurant didnt reach the Very Good level yet, so it sits between Average and Very Good rating. For non ASEAN people, this is the best place in Singapore to try authentic Malay food. However, as a Malaysian, you can find the same food everywhere in Malaysia and Indonesia at half the price.Average meal will cost a person about SGD8-12 with drinks, depending on what you select
5
We went there for lunch. We have to order the food and pay for it then take it to your table to enjoy it. Very clean place. Nice ambience but can get very busy and crowded. Food is superb. Some of the best Malay cuisine I have tasted in my life. I have to admit I am very picky about Malay food. I only go for Malay food if there is no other choice. I went here because of the very high recommendation. We had the very popular Tauhu Telur. It was just fantastic. I also liked the Lontong. It would have been awesome if it was warmer. Anyway it was still fantastic. The Ikan Panggang (fish) was fresh, well grilled. I would certainly go here every time I come down to Singapore. The sirap limau selasih was the best I have had in my life. Highly recommended.
4
If you craving for Malay - Indonesian food or let's say Nasi Padang, go grab it there :) it is cheap, tastes good, there is always a queue but will not take too long to get served, as well as will easy to get table eventhough it is so busy (this is really a place for eating, not comfortable to sit too long)
5
We reserved a table for 15 persons apparently that day was busy day we couldn't get to sit together. We had a discussion which still went nicely with the arrangement. We ordered set menu in advanced and it was too much food serves for us though, the main courses and desserts, but we had no choice we had to booked 15 sets for 15 persons. Our fellow Singaporeans took the leftovers home, so the food wasn't wasted. The place was nice with aircon but the music was too loud, I had to asked them to lower the volume so we could have our discussion
5
i love the foods, so many choices but its all spicy but still i loveee all the foods. please come and feel the long que at this kedai but its all worthed
5
... just like the other outlet at Joo Chiat. Consistent quality, fast and professional service. Good for grilled fish, tahu telor, ...
4
one of my favorite place to eat in singapore, especially when i wanted to eat indonesian food. paru balado is my favorite food. the food was delicious. and i think the price was affordable. not really expensive. i pay about 23 dollar for 3 people.
2
The food here are over rated. Not sure whether the cashier knows how to charge. My bfast - white rice, sambal goreng pengantin n a potatoes cutlet cost me SGD7/- . No drinks ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•
5
One of the few Malay food that I reaally enjoyed very much. Is a must try. Prices are reasonable. But lunch seems always crowded.
5
Will always come for lunch with office colleagues and brought back desserts for afternoon tea break.

Hjh Maimunah offers all the beautiful flavourfull Malay delicacies in one place, it was a wide range of dishes to choose from where you merely pick and choose what you like...they are known for their nasi padang which is basically rice and range of dishes that go with it. I choose the grilled sambal chicken, beef rendang, sambal kangkung, cucumber and pineapple salad and stir fried okra. My choices were limited in order to keep my meal as healthy as possible and staying away from most of the fried or oily stuff and with generous helpings of vegetables. They offer plenty of choice and value for money, theres a always queue for lunch which proves there popularity and its totally worth the visit to sample some famous dishes and an completely satisfying meal. My last visit her, I ended up trying the grilled stingray and sambal squid which was also amazing. Would recommend it to anyone
5
You will have no regret visiting this restaurant. The food is simply great. The restaurant serves authentic Malay cuisines like ayam bakar, lemak cilli api, sambal berlado, siput sedut...etc. I had a sumptuous meal for 2 for only SGD 17. The staffs were kind and courteous exhibiting the polite nature of the Malay culture. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Malay Food
4
Location wise it is not very convenient but the food is marvelous. Price is about S$7 -10 per pax so it is affordable but maybe pricey it you compare to neighbourhood stalls. Just take note that they ordering system is Self Service. More like a cafeteria, where you have to queue to select your dishes and then order your drinks and finally pay for it at the cashier. Very crowded during lunch hours so if you are a tourist, i will suggest going before 12 or after 2pm
5
We sought out this restaurant because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor and very glad we did as I don't think we would've come across it on our own. It was very crowded, but luckily there were some customers who immediately offered us their table as they were finishing up. Luckily no queues. This is a cafeteria style restaurant where you line up with your tray and order your dishes and they serve you immediately. There were other customers - two ladies who were picking up their lunch - who saw I was having some difficulty deciding and kindly talked me through all the dishes and told me exactly what they were and which were the traditional delicacies. Hence the reason I picked the squid in black ink. It was delicious, the ginger hit you first then the spices kicked in. Normally not into over spiced, hot dishes but this was amazing and could've easily gone back for more. We decided to share between three, so be sure to order for two on the one plate, one serve is definitely only for one and not enough to share.These kind ladies even came over to the table and told us all about the desserts. There were a couple of donut looking things, but they are not quite what they look like. The 'dark donut' was actually a sweet potato dessert, the lighter one made from a flour and the jelly looking ones were actually a tapioca dessert. None of them sweet like our desserts, the only sweetness you get from them is the sugar on top. The banana fritters are also very nice. We were the only tourists there and we loved eating like the locals do and good value for money
5
they have plenty of dishes. i like the deep fried beancurd!! crsipy from the outside and soft texture inside.
5
I was taken by a friend to this restaurant. The service was like in a canteen and the choice and type of food was similar to Padang food. Tje taste was very good and the price was reasonable.
4
One of Padang restaurants in Kampung Glam, Bugis Area. Their food is halal and very tasty, plus not so pricy. Had dinner with family, they loved it. We tried nasi lemak, nasi goreng kampung, grilled chicken and the dessert was sea coconut with fruit cocktail.
4
Lunch with colleagues, our favourite spot for malay cuisine.
Lots of dish varieties, and also kuih for desert. Rice with 4 selections and teh tarik, around $7 plus.
Recently renovated with air-con dining areas at ground and 2nd floor.
5
We were initially a bit off by the huge queue as the system here is you wait in line and select what you want and then pay at the till. We had no idea about many of the dishes and thought we'd hold everyone up in their precious lunch hour. We needn't have worried. Everyone was so kind. The people in the queue and the staff. They helped us decide on Tahu Telur Jakarta, beef rendang, mee soup and mixed spicy rice. All absolutely delicious. We particularly enjoyed the Tahu Telur Jakarta which we'd never had before. Place was packed and deservedly so. We will be back. Recommended.
4
Best to share dishes here as it can get pricey if you order individual mix rice with a lot of meat. The must try dishes are tahu telor (beancurd omelette drizzled in spicy sweet soy sauce), lemak siput sedut (sea snail), and ayam masak merah (spicy tomato chicken). They have mee soto and mee bakso too if you're not in the mood for rice. And if you still have space after the main meal, go for the malay kuihs (desserts).It can get rather intimidating as to how things work there, for first timers. Just follow the queue, inform the person behind the counter if you want "noodles, rice (meaning individual portion) to eat in or to go, or sharing with how many people", then point to the dishes you want. If you're ordering for individual meal, all the dishes will be placed onto your plate of rice, with the exception of soup stuff. For sharing, they'll scoop into smaller bowls/plates. Collect your food at the end. if you want drinks or kuihs, take them and put in on the tray together with your food. Drinks can be ordered if you don't see them at the counter such as tea, pulled tea (teh tarik), coffee. When you're done, proceed to the cashier to pay and get your cutleries. If you've ordered a lot and can't carry everything, fret not as there are waiters who can help you carry your dishes to your table. Remember that in Singapore, we have the culture of "chope-ing" (reserving) tables with tissue packs, umbrellas, cards etc before we order. So please reserve your table like the locals do, and remember your table number if you need the service of the waiters. Hajah Maimunah is a popular place with locals and tourists so do avoid the 12-1.30pm peak period on weekdays. They do have seats at the air-conditioned area on level 2 but it's closed off sometimes
4
Wide range of dishes, you'll be spoilt for choice. Would recommend Tahu Telur, grilled seabass, Ayam Bakar along with their variety of vegetable dishes. Not many options for vegetarian though. If you are feeling adventurous, try their Siput sedut and you'll be sucking those slimy snails and licking its delicious gravy off your fingers..
5
So happy that Singapore has my kind of food, Padang food! Once a while I would like to eat serious food (spicey Padang food is serious for me) during my visit to Singapore. This place makes me feel home, the people, the food presentation, the service, and of course the taste. All taste just so real so right.After a long walk around Kampung Glam, it is the right thing to do to come to this place.I had rice dish: their Rendang, with pickled cucumber, and asked for curry sauce to give more flavor to my steamed rice. Yum! Will come back here next time am in Singapore! Btw, the price is really value for money a.k.a cheap.
4
It's been a long time since I had good tasty Malay food and Haja Maimunah gave that authentic taste. Enjoyed myself. The assam pedas sting ray was hot and spicy. The tahu telor was also good.. but it was be freshly fried. Variety are a lot. Slightly pricey but it's okie to pay for quality.
4
Located in Kampong Glam and Joo chiat they start as early as 8.30am and you can have delicious Malay breakfast like soto ayam. They have various kueh at the other counter.Its infamous kukulo (sea shells) cooked in lemak turmeric soup and you will not have enough of it. Beef rendang cooked dry and its spicy paru (lung) is soft unlike the traditional dry one which I request be back on the menu. The sayur lodeh with egg and bean curd is a delight when you pour over your rice together with the blachan chilli.The ikan bakar bbq and sprinkled with big onions and green chilli and black sauce poured over it. The stewed stomach is soft and springy and the nanka (jackfruit) lemak is soft.Lapar (hungry) anyone ? Hurry enjoy this wonderful Malay cuisine
4
Take away this time. Long queue but in their own way, they are efficient. Restaurant is always full and they run out of their popular dishes very quickly. Be there early.
5
My mom and I stumbled upon this lovely place on our way to (closed) Gaylang Sempai hawker. This place serves very good halal food. If you are craving curries, drop by and satisfy that craving here! Will definitely be back.
5
The food was delicious and had many choice, the price is cheap
There is bakwan, which very delicious, and mie bakso also our fav menu
Will get back to this resto if we visit singapore later
4
Tasty dishes, wide variety and value for your buck. Great dining option to bring your family & overseas friends to try delicious Malay rice & dishes.
4
We try to go to this restaurant every time we comeback to Singapore.
If you are game for traditional malay food - this is a good place to go. Not overly expensive and you get variety of food.
Best time to go - early lunch!
3
decided this place cuz we need halal food near our hotel. Not many restaurant nearby open early morning like here. Since the restaurant is Malaysian ownership, the menus are also Malaysian (Indonesian) dishes like nasi lemak, mie soto, rendang etc. It's a bit pricey, for steamed rice with sunny side up and lemon ice cost me 3SGD, the taste is so-so tbh
4
I arrived after 7.30pm at this restaurant. There was not much left to eat but even then whatever was available tasted really good. They close at 8pm daily. Best time to.come is for lunch when the meals are freshly cooked. Price is reasonable. Dinner for 2 cost us about $18
2
If you want to enjoy nice Padang Food/Malay this place is good and close to Santa Grand Hotel Bugis. I love the food variety. I had dinner with my mom here before headed back to our hotel. It was around 7pm ish. The food was good and spicy but cold. The beverage service is slow and the lady who attended the food counter too was very unfriendly. The cashier attendant was very polite and efficient. The waiter was very smart looking and very attentive to the cleanliness of the restaurant. I only dislikes the beverage preparation service, lady at food counter was very sour face and serves cold food for early dinner. But hey good food I can forget about the sour face lady :
4
Nestled in the Arab street, this place is hidden on of the short alley. The place has a lot of character and food os delicious. They serve pre cooked food and is quick. I would recommend the pink drink called Bali and snails. We also had cow lungs. Really enjoyed my food here.
5
The restaurant is usually packed during lunch time but the service is fast. The set menu for large groups are recommended as there is a good variety of different dishes served. The ikan pari (sting ray) bakar is delicious and so is the tender daging rendang. The tauhu goreng (fried tofu with special sauce and veggies) is excellent. One the best Malay restaurant in Singapore.... thumbs up from me 
5
The food here is yummy and always good value for money. We usually share at least 6 dishes to enjoy the variety. All the dishes are delicious and have never had a bad one.
3
Good food. Located nearby the village bugis hotel, you can get there by walking across the hotel.
Many choices of food, snacks and beverages.
Across that you can see fluff bakery (cup cake store).
Beside this place there's vietnam food and it's halal.
4
I took a lunch at Hj Maimunah on Joochiat. It is one of the best place for malay culinary. Always crowded at lunch time but we got a table eventually.
5
Q will definitely be very long for sure especially on a weekend.. so try to be early... and there's a number of Malay dishes to choose from... come and try..... =)
4
Fantastic place for Malay/Indonesian food, lots of dishes to choose from, lots of seats, accessible location. There is quite a queue every lunch time and it gets pricey if you order a lot of meat.
5
Loved the dishes served here. Plenty to choose from. Besides rice, they also have traditional Malay desserts. If you are heading there for lunch, make sure you get there early. Otherwise be prepared to wait for a table.
3
This is my second time having lunch here. I though the last time I was here, 3 years ago the taste was much much better. I am not sure if the restaurant keeping up with the same quality of food. Need improvement at the kitchen, the last thing we need is good review but did not meet the expectation. Sorry, Please improve.
5
If you're looking for halal food, seek no further. This place starts their serving at 7 am (I don't think they serve dinner, but you can check their website for that info). Since they are a catering service, so you can expect an excellent quality & cleanliness.The food portion was huge for our little tummies
5
This restaurant was suggested to us by a guide, post a tour.So glad we listened.Went a total of three times in 4 days, chose different food each time and was never disappointed.We had to queue each time but the queues moved quite fast. Pointing made up for my non-existant language skills, staff busy but patient and some food i'd never tasted before but now have as favourites.Off to search for Malay recipes
5
There is a wide selection of delicious local food and kue kue. Mee Bakso my favourite. Sup Buntut my mom"s. Mee goreng my dahling. Love the ayam bakar and sambal goreng. You name it they have it...nasi padang.It is like fast food and you can take home some dishes too. Come just before lunch as the food is freshest.The Jalan Pisang outlet is Closed on Sunday.The Joo Chiat outlet is Closed on Monday.If you work there you get free food
3
the range is about the same as before but now to get the sambal balado may be quite difficult, usually they don't have except sambal tumis, sambal belanchan
4
Offers a lot of authentic malay foods. The foods are delicious and affordable. Should try their siput sedut, tahu telur and ayam bijan (just to name a few). Normally over crowded during lunch hour.
4
We came here, just slightly before lunch time. We were lucky, we arrived on the perfect timing. 15 minutes later, the restaurant was packed, and people were queuing.The food is good, like malay house cooking. a little bit sweeter compare to Indonesian food, but still very good and most importantly, HALAL.We also ordered some food for take away, and heat them up later at our condo.highly recommended....
4
We were looking for an authentic Singaporean Malay food. And we found it here. Price was reasonable and foods were good. So many selection for the cooked food, we tried a few andwe liked it. We also ordered the grilled stingray which was good. 2 storey makes it easy to find a seats.If you're looking for a malay food in Joo Chiat/Geylang I would recommend this restaurant
4
This is a place to go when you have not had your breakfast and have a feel for something spicy and delicious. Recommended dishes is the grilled fish, sambal fish, squid, prawns and the brinjal. Eat it with the "Belacan". The price is really reasonable, You may have to wait for a table and don't forget, after the meal, have a hot cup of tea and soak in the atmosphere of the location

At the suggestion of someone at Tourist Information, we lunched here on our visit to Kampong Glam on Friday 6th November 2015. Being a prayer day at the local mosque, the restaurant seemed packed and the queue was building up. When we got to the counter, the dishes did not seem to have any labels on them to indicate what they were. Although we were at the head of the queue, the staff began serving customers behind us in the queue â€“ much to our dismay. With our limited knowledge of Malay, we resorted to get the attention of one of the staff and eventually made our selection by pointing to the dishes on display behind the glass cabinet.We chose ayam lemak chilli padi, ikan asam pedas, padang beef rendang, and bayam to go with our plates of rice. We also ordered a bowl of lontong. Upon paying at the cashierâ€™s, a waiter carried our tray for us and since all the tables seemed to be taken, he led us upstairs to an air-conditioned dining room and sat us at a nice table for two.The ayam lemak (chicken cooked in a coconut and turmeric sauce with birdâ€™s eye chillies) was very palatable. The ikan asam pedas (fish in a sourish spicy gravy) was delectable. The padang beef rendang was well marinated and flavoursome. The bayam (cooked spinach) provided the right amount of greens to go with our nasi padang meal. We then dug into our lontong (compressed rice cakes in a coconut vegetable stew) which was excellent.Our drinks were two glasses of lime juice which complemented the varied flavours of our choice of dishes. Overall, this was worth the hassles at the queue, and proved to be a most enjoyable Malay lunch and the price was very affordable

Don't be fooled by the somewhat canteen-like queue structure. It is common for you to queue and choose your 'lauk', or dishes to be served with warm white rice. Bear in mind there are various type of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. It can be intimidating to be presented with over 20 dishes, however, all are worth to be given a shot.My favourite appetizers are definitely the Ulam & Sambal Belacan. Very refreshing and interesting combo!My favourite dishess are:1) Sundanese BBQ chicken - grilled chicken with spicy & sweet sauce served with lime2) Ikan pari - barbecued stingray3) Sambal Goreng Pengantin- a mix of crisp fried red shallots, red and green chili, shrimp paste and salt, briefly stir-fried in coconut oil with long beans, tempeh, & paru.My favourite side dishes:1) Tempe Madu2)BegedelThose with a higher spice tolerance, make sure you ask for more Sambal belacan - sambal a common condiment, made with chilies, shallots, garlic, tomatoes, tamarind paste, and shrimp paste.Happy eating!! :

I had a craving for nasi padang and convinced my colleague to go with me for lunch here. Thereâ€™s a long queue of people when I arrived at 1pm. But the queue moves fast and within 5 minutes, it was my turn to order.The restaurant has expanded to the unit next door, which is air-conditioned. I spotted a sign that said there were seats on the second floor. I checked it out an itâ€™s also air-conditioned! I promptly got my colleague to sit upstairs. The stairs are steep and narrow, so do walk carefully.Here are the items I had:- Tahu Goreng: This is huge, easily for at least 3 pax. Its crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It has a generous serving of sweet sauce. Its topped with julienned carrot and cucumber and a good helping of crushed peanuts. Must order!- Beef Rendang: The rendang has good taste and great with plain rice.- Sambal Goreng: Beancurd and tempeh cut into cubes and stir fry with cut long beans and sambal. Its spicy!- Paru: Thin sliced beef lung stir fried with chilli paste. This may not sound nice, but its really tasty and good.I spent $11.50.Overall a good meal, although the food is spicy and I started to perspire 1/3 way into the meal
4
This place seldom let me down. It is one of my fav nasi padang place.The tahu telok (fries beancurd with egg plus sweet sauce) is a must try. The assam pedas is also nice. The gravy is heavenly. The sambal goreng was a little disappointing this time. It was too wet. The ayam merah could be better.We also ordered the lungs which my mum ate for the 1st time. She love it. The belanchan was fantastic! I love the black chili blended sauce too.Should come try out the dishes. They are really fantastic.
3
Used to be very good and I would say great but it has somehow lost its touch. The food is now overpriced. What shocked me earlier when I saw a notice customers would still have to pay if a dessert dropped just like ''Nice to touch but if it breaks you pay''. Hmmmmm It is sad and a shame a Muslim eatery would be so calculative in such manner
4
All the dishes are delicious. Cheap too. Will always order the siput sedut and tahu goreng. There's variety of dishes and you will spoilt for choices.
5
located at bugis area, this is a must try for muslims visiting singapore. clean and packed most of the time. it is closed on sunday.
5
We were staying near Bugis/Arab Street area and four of us decided to have lunch here. We arrived at 12 noon on Friday, luckily it was not crowded but about an hour later, it's was crowded. Amazingly, there are so many variety of foods to choose from. We had Siput masak lemak, grilled fish, Asam Pedas Fish, Squids in black ink sauce, Beef Rendang and vegetables. The foods is delicious and reasonable price. Highly recommended this place for authentic Malay foods
5
Super delicious malay food. It's hard to find this kind of quality nowadays, not even in Malaysia or somewhere else, unless of course you travel to the village areas.Service was good and prompt too. Friendly staff, though they did not have too much time to smile, but they are really helpful
5
If you are looking for an authentic Malay and Indonesia cuisines, this is the place. It is cafeteria style restaurant with too many choices, your will be challenged to only choose two or three dishes. Splurge, because the dishes are very reasonable, most dishes are between S$4 -S$6. If you are adventurous, try the drink called "Bandung", it is pink, because it has rose syrup. It is creamy, sweet and refreshing
3
went there for lunch at this joo chiat reataurant. food was just ok,but too over priced for 2 of us, came up to about S$48. i was just dump founded. will not get into this restaurant again. I think geylang serai market offers great food concepts with taste and much more affordable
4
The food is super delish but queue is super long. I don't mind as I have been eyeing on their drop-dead menus, esp the siput sedut!! It's slightly pricey but hey, what the heck. First floor dnining area is what MOST people like but I always loved the second floor. The waiter will bring your food to the second floor, which I'm quite impress with. The cashier could smile a little more and we are all customers makaning there. And I always, ALWAYS tapau their food. Sadly, few of my friends & relatives didn't agree with me about hteir food but it's their loss, not mine. HA!Psst... Bear in mind. It's hard to avoid peak hours (lunch or dinner) as there is NO peak hours to aviod the crowd. So .. what does that mean? Their food so super delish
5
I was craving for malay food for quite a while and in my last week trip to Singapore, i had a chance to try food at this restaurant. We had rendang, ulam & sambal belacan, grilled chicken with soya sauce, curry, fried salted fish end sweet delicacies. If there is tempe.. i will sure add it to our choice. It was meal of the week.. .. satisfying
4
location - Jalan Pisang and car park is a pain and a half!premise - they have expanded and now have 2 shop house and 1 floor of shop house that will be able to sit more patrons.staff - not much interaction with them, some just clean the tables and others are behind the counter.food - good SG version of Nasi Padang. I am indonesian so i can safely say that the nasi padang here in SG is more suited to the local taste and hygiene levels :) not saying that this is bad but it is missing that 'toilet rush' addition to the Indo Nasi Padang that is normally the caseprice - all nasi padang restos in SG charge a premium, this is a standard but the helpings here are also slightly more than others.verdict - go there when its NOT lunch hour. the crowd can get astronomical! but is it worth the wait? YES
5
All the food was great. Pleanty of options to choose from. Breakfast was nice as I was heaving Nasi Leamak with Beef Rendang and my wife was having Malay Traditiional Kuih. My In laws love to eat there since the taste was so nice. Even they also have lunch secretel
