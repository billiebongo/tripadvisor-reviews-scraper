My wife had the yummy purple sweet potato ice cream üç¶ after dinner this evening. It was really yummy and the children could not get enough of it. It tasted smooth and soft, and is supposed to be healthy too!

Visited Square2 for lunch today and had a Small Potato Party with my husband for dessert. We topped up 50cents for 2 flavours of ice cream. Ice cream itself is yummy and not crazy sweet.
