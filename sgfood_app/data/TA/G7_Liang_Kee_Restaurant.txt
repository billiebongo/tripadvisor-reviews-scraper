The fishes we ate are delight, services is attentive. Restaurant setup is local mid-range. Good for family and friend gathering if you want to try local foods.

This is not a touristic place at all. It is simple as in not fancy and serves great food. Service is good. Things arrive fast and it is great for a group. I'd come back

Had another satisfying comfort meal at G7 on Xmas Eve... This restaurant never crowded in the stretch of Havelock Road eateries. So no reservation needed based on my many experiences. Even if crowded; service is pretty fast; rarely waited >15' before food appears on yr table... My regular must have Promfret cooked 2 ways - fillet blanched n lighted cooked with sauce; deep fried bones tasted awesome at $51.. Sambal crayfish never failed to disappoint; gravy is sedap; not too spicy or oily.. Thai style trotter - deep fried style with pickled apple; cucumber was average.. Prefer traditional braised version. Prawn roll with home made tofu never disappoint me. For veggies; we had spinach with 3 types of eggs... Very good indeed... Lady boss was as always very friendly n chatty... Orh Nee on the house. No service charge only GST.. A good meal as alway

I revisited this restaurant after quite a few years and my oh my...the standard has improved.Came twice this year, once with my friends and the other with my family. Would recommend not taking their set menu for 10, unless you have big eaters in your group, as they are pretty generous with the serving for every dish.Not to miss : cold crab, cold terrine (猪头冻），steamed pomfret, fried salted veg kuay teow and yam paste dessert. Enjoy good old traditional Teochew food

Service was warm and attentive. Cuisine is very traditional and typical Teochew but a little costly for the quality and quantity. We went for the set dinner which included most of their recommended dishes. Pomfret was fresh but a little small for our group of 7 pax. The braised duck was excellent, tender and well braised without being too salty. The Orh Nee (yam paste) was not too sweet but not smooth enough too

Located just outside the CBD / Orchard Shopping Belt (10mins by Taxi / car) it is located along a stretch of eateries and foot spa. This restaurant serves very good (and under-rated) Chinese food (Teochew style) including their version of Curry Fish-Head (thick curry gravy that I drink it as soup), Cereal Big Prawn, Black Pepper Crab and Chilli Crab (crab served is slightly smaller than those at Jumbo and No Sign Board), but equally tasty and a much lower price.Try their deep fried salmon fish skin with egg yolk as a starter, it's delicious.Many other delicious food in the menu, good value for the money.If there is any set-back; yes, please improve the toilet or at least a decent clean basin for washing hands

Visited this restaurant after watching a documentary on teo Chew food. Asked to order from set menu as all the dishes were there, so we did that. However, the briased duck came without the tofu. We gave expressed instructions for the cold plate to come without the trotters and replaced with the kungpo chicken but that did not happen either. The cold crab was good and the fish too. The fried kway teow too. Truly teochew. But the bill was way overpriced. At the end of the day. Roughly 60 per dish which makes it not very value for money. If you are prepared to spend to resolve this teochew food craving and you are ready to spend money

This is a pleasant local family restaurant. Aircon is good but it is noisy when it is packed. Not fancy, just good wholesome food and pleasant servce. They always seem eager to serve and be helpful.We tried the superb fried soon hock fish with gravy, the favorite Hey Chor- prawn rolls - light and fresh taste, cold crab is why we come here - consistently good, fish maw soup - one of the best around, and chai po hor fun (broad rice noodles with pickled radish). We were so full but also had chives with prawns, and the taro or yam dessert.We were satiated and had to take home the balance, which were still good the next day

LIANG KEE restaurant used to THE Teochew restaurant, having many branches over Singapore. However, over the years, Liang Kee chain has shrunk the operation and closed many of the branches (due probably to competitions, labour, and other problems...), with now the main restaurant operates in Havelock Road. The location is not too ideal, as many diners are unfamiliar with the area; parking is also a problem. The ambience is that of a typical Chinese mid-range restaurant set up. The service is acceptable. The quality and choice of food is average, while the price is on the high side. A typical set lunch for 4-6 persons is about S$400.00, excluding drinks. Lunch crowd is poor
