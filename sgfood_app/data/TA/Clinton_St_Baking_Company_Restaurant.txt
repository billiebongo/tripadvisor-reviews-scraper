It's my second time here. I really enjoy the food here. Drinks are alright. Atmosphere can be market noisy during peak period, but food is still served within reasonable waiting time. Staff are pretty nice too. will be back (:
5
2nd visit here. Pancakes still the best. Had the seasonal strawberry pancake. love it, will come again soon.
5
Great vibe as you would expect in a busy bustling cafe . The service is good and the food is excellent. Although Saturday was very busy the server took our mobile number and texted us to inform us our table was ready .
4
Ordered their signature Chicken and waffles and it was fabulous. Chicken was well-seasoned and waffles are nice and fluffy.
4
Not my 1st visit~ Chicken Sandwich is still awesome~ the fries are probably homemade as well~ very nice All-Day Breakfast menu overall~
4
One of the best pancakes in Singapore that i had. Its a bit on the pricey side. But worth the visit once in a while.
4
the pancakes are excellent as usual, soft, fluffy, piping hot. perfect when paired with the maple butter or when slathered in melted chocolate
4
If you are looking for a perfect place for brunch you found it. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, patties, biscuits, rosti ... the list goes on with warm maple butter. How not to salivate! Operating hours from 0830hrs to 1800hrs located on a street of boutique hotels and good restaurants. A taste of New York in Civic District Singapore.
4
Called in here with the lads, flash skipped breakfast today, Charles played with it and Kyle demolished it. We all got a country breakfast which was ham, hash brown, bun, scrambled eggs. It was nice but the eggs were too milky in my opinion. The orange juice was beautiful and water was provided
3
Clinton St. has always been on the top 3 of my go-to list whenever it comes to brunch. Of all the time I visit their food never disappoint but not sure why the service is getting worse. The reception was rude and making us feel unwelcome. Taking very long to prepare our food and ages to get our bill.
5
Crispy, tender chicken on fluffy waffles paired with a really yummy maple sauce. Always a good fix for my brunch cravings. Good to share with friends as portion is large. Try the blueberry pancakes as well, really good.
4
Staff were friendly and the blueberry pancakes lived up to its expectations. Fluffy and great blueberry maple butter sauce. IMO the savoury food isn’t that great.
5
We are 2nd times here for branch.
Love their pancake and butter milk fried chicken waffles. Definitely we we come back again.
5
Went to eat breakfast here after a workout session, so had a healthy appetite going in. The pancakes were extremely filling but tasty. Would probably visit again.
3
Despite my plate being lowish in carbs(huevos rancheros), the rest of the menu was starch and or sugar, a bit disappointing. Service was good, as were the drinks. Best to avoid weekends if possible.
4
The place will be very packed during weekend and this time round we needed to “shout” instead of “talk”. The food undeniably yummy.
3
We ordered buttermilk sandwich and buttermilk fried chicken. Both were too salty. The place is cosy and suitable for family with kids.
4
It has good service where we're promptly seated, attended to and served. It is a bustling place even at 9.15 am(!) but yet there is enough space for comfort where some cafes just feel too busy and crampled. It seems to be a popular place with expats and western-asian couples as it forms the majority of their patrons. Most patrons are thus couples or families (with children).I ordered the buttermilk biscuit sandwich (a mix between scone and biscuit), homemade rosemary pork patties and a macchiato -- which isn't available on menu but available when I made a request for it, while my friend ordered a iced mint tea and Clinton St Omelette (with goat's cheese and swiss).The prices between the different breakfast items are very similar and is approx. SGD 20 on average. Comparing the serving size between both our orders, I would think it is a good serving for the price paid and taste is within expectations -- no particular wow factor but it isn't bad. Macchiato was good and so was the iced mint tea which was very minty and thus refreshing. I would recommend the rosemary pork patties as it turned out surprisingly good -- has wow factor. It was 3 small pieces (within center of palm), that is made with minced pork and has a sweet glaze on it -- maybe honey. It was cooked till only tender pink so it was very soft and goes well with something -- glaze could be a bit sweet when eaten on its own
5
Read about Clinton St Baking company in TripAdvisor. It was only three blocks from the hotel. We arrived early just after opening. Ordered the pancakes and French toast along with the twice smoked bacon. The coffee included with breakfast was brewed and good. Second cup was an additional charge. The serving was more than sufficient. We enjoyed breakfast
4
Tried the pancakes, chicken and waffles, and white brew coffee here for lunch.At the time of this review, they had a 50% off for any second lunch main item, so that was fortunate.The pancakes were light and fluffy, but I sense I may be a bit too filling for the average stomach. Would recommend a plate to share with friends instead.The chicken was tender, coated in Southern styled buttermilk and cornmeal, and paired with a sweet maple brown sauce. They went well together, and complemented the waffle even more. I felt my waffle was a tad soggy for my liking, but otherwise nothing else unsatisfactory.The white brew was too sweet, in my opinion, but I can see many others liking it. Perhaps I lost my sweet tooth.Staff were attentive, and helped accommodate us even with a stroller and baby in hand. It should be pointed out that there isn't space for multiple strollers, so multiple people with strollers may have to leave them out front.
4
All day American Style breakfast. Been here a couple of times, the blueberry pancakes is really good.
5
best pancakes i've eaten in my life! the rest of the food though... you can forget about it. very crowded during peak period so reservation is definitely needed
4
The chicken waffles and scrambled eggs was delicious. Will revisit Clinton Street Baking Company again.
4
Super fluffy and soft pancakes that were such a delight to eat!! Love the brunch there as well!! Cosy environment
4
Place is cosy and simple deco. Ordered Blueberry pancakes, Biscuit Sandwich, Egg benedicts and Country Breakfast. add-on side of Jalapeno corn bread, chorizo and Stir fry spinach. Egg bens and country breakfast was a let down but the other 2 was awesome to me.
5
had banana muffin, toast and house granola and milkshake. everything excellent, and great service too!
4
Here usually packs a crowd and a queue, so we were surprised we could have brunch here on New Years. Brunch quality was standard/decent, service was friendly and attentive.
3
I went here for breakfast one morning in part because it was near my hotel. I had perhaps unfair expectations because it shares a street with some Michelin star restaurants. I ordered a cold brew coffee which was very good and the breakfast sandwich. My biggest complaint was the tomato jam they used on the sandwich. It was more like a marinara sauce and didn’t match the rest of the meal. The biscuit of the sandwich was delicious though and I’d definitely give another try but order the pancakes as so many people recommend. They looked fantastic.
4
I had a craving for pancakes and Clinton St. Baking Company fulfilled my craving. I had the blueberry pancakes without the maple butter. The pancakes are thick and fluffy with a blueberry sauce covering them. Personally, I would have liked more sauce, but that might have been because I didn't have the butter (butter and I don't get along). They have a full menu for breakfast and serve it all day long
5
Today is our 3rd trip back after going somewhere different for breakfast yesterday and was sorely disappointed... had to come back here as the pancakes are to die for!!! 3 massive pancakes stacked up with your choice of flavors with maple syrup too My husband had the omelette and I’ve got the brioche toast yum yum yum!!!! 5/5 ⭐️
5
Food was great! Especially the beef bowl, it was so good that we ordered another one as it was eaten in seconds... Very cosy environment. Will definitely go back again
5
Perfect spot for a brunch date with my girlfriend. Had the best pancakes of life and I haven't stopped thinking about them since. So good, the space is sadly rather tiny and squeezy but the food makes up for it.
4
Pancakes with blueberry, buttermilk chicken on waffles are a must try but don’t expect it to taste exactly alike the one in NY :). You could give the cakes a miss, it was dry and eggy.
4
Was here after lunch, so could not try their brunch sets which seem popular with the patrons. The coffee, although machine made is aromatic and smooth. The cheesecake is yummilicious.
3
This cafe was right in front of the hotel I was staying at and I decided to go and have breakfast there. In the end I had the blueberry cheese cake with tea. I didn't really like the cheesecake.
The service was good
2
food options are minimal and weekends no salad menu. price is high comapred to the food on the table
2
Ordered Angus Beef cheese burger but was disappointed when the food arrived. The fries seem to be fried by overused oil and the burger buns r burnt.
4
Egg benedict was cooked too long, yolk was hardboiled. Pancake a little mushy. Else overall was a pleasant dinner. Nice setting.
4
The food is generally good, except for the cakes. I always get the fried chicken and waffles. Not so good place for desserts though, go somewhere else.
4
Used chope reservation with my boyfriend during Xmas. Ordered the blueberry pancakes which were light and fluffy! My boyfriend had the chicken waffles, and tip: have to pour the maple syrup on the chicken as well as the chicken on its own can be a tad salty. Staff was responsive
2
Food was alright; ordered the blueberry pancakes, chicken and waffles & salmon scramble. Was only impressed with the chicken (excl the waffle). Pricey!
5
Booked way in advance for a table and restaurant was very crowded. Service was prompt but the wait for food is quite long cos of the crowd. Taste was good
5
Wonderful vibe & great Spanish scrambled eggs. Milkshakes are delish too!
Great for a late breakfast.
4
Awesome Buttermilk Fried Chicken!! Huge serving just like American style~ Milkshakes are awesome too!! =)
4
Enjoy coming here when in the area. Food is generally good,
especially the blueberry pancakes. Will be back soon!
5
Nice place with good service, good food, a tad bit expensive but it's good if you're looking to enjoy a good food,
4
Food was great however, I think it is quite expensive. Noise was inevitable because of the number of people. Overall, not bad.
5
This is my go to breakfast spot when I’m in Singapore on layover. Always fast and friendly service, with a modern near hipster vibe. The coffee is fantastic and the orange juice is squeezed in front of you. The food menu has a great western selection, all living up to the standard those trend setters from Sydney/Melbourne/Brisbane are all used to. Looking forward to my next trip here :
2
Wanted to have a quick lunch here before watching a play at the national library actoss the streetI made the reservation TWO MONTHS ago for 12pm. My friend arrived 5 minutes early but alas i was 20min late. They said sorry, we are now on the waiting list, as they expect ALL parties to be on time. You know, like a commumist state or military schoolSo priority certainly goes to walk-ins. Don't bother with reservations if you can't guarantee all your friends will be punctua
3
The servers at Clinton Street are nice and friendly, service is also quick and attentive.On the food, it’s tasty, but the portions are incredibly small especially for the prices.The interiors are drab, and looks unfinished. The lights are also very bright, perhaps consider dimming it during dinner service for a better atmosphere
3
The pancakes were indeed fluffy and yummy, however I think the prices aren't very justified considering it isn't very difficult making pancakes like this at home. But still worth a visit.. Oh well \\//
5
Good food and robust coffee but the noise level was too much to bear. I could hardly hear my companion.
5
The place was v quiet and the food portion was surprisingly quite huge. Not only that, it tasted th best pancake I've ever tried so fluffy and smells good. Will definitely visit again to try their other dishes which looks amazing!
5
We had fried chicken with waffles. In fact I order this every time i'm here. The sides were good too! The cakes though aren't their strength.
4
Serves up delicious all day breakfast. But the star of the menu has to be the pancakes. Served warmed and fluffy, and the blueberries give it an added kick.
4
The pancakes served here were light and fluffy even though they looked thick and dense. The maple butter that with it complimented the dish well. It had everything a typical maple syrup would have, but with an incredible texture and aroma. Another dish noteworthy was the Clinton St. Omelette. The scrambled eggs were airy and can be paired with 2 different stuffing such as cheese and bacon, etc. The ambience was uplifting and the decor was set to give customers a 'trip to New York' without leaving the country. Overall a pleasant restaurant to go to for breakfast or brunch, and I would definitely return there again
5
Got attracted to this restaurant cos i saw the fluffy pancakes on Instagram! Couldn't resist and I made a reservation immediately for the same day. It's perfect! Staff were really helpful and welcoming as well. Good ambiance. Tried their coffee and buttermilk chicken as well. Both were good! Definitely coming back with more people :
4
New York style posh diner with a careful selection of items that seem to hint at the hackneyed mantra of do it small but do it right. Pancakes are the clear winner here. Followed by waffles and buttermilk chicken. Close call is fried chicken with jalapeño cornbread, flavours I haven’t had before. It’s all in all a good eat with lovely clean well lit interior.
3
Only gave this place 3 out of 5 as I am not sure if I would recommend this place a "must visit". The food was decent (as expected) and the portions were huge. Both me and my friend were not able to finish our meals (we were there for breakfast). I was not impressed with the service though. The drinks which included my coffee came way ahead of my meal and I normally like to have (hot) coffee with my breakfast, not as an appetiser. I asked to just have egg whites, which was a customisation option on the menu but I was told that I can only have egg whites sunny side up and not cooked any other way. I found that extremely strange. In addition we asked for butter and jam to have with our breakfast and was told that jam was chargeable. I feel that's a bit unreasonable for a cafe known for it's breakfast. Really unsure if I will ever go back there again, and actually might actively dissuade wanting to try out this place because of the service
4
The staff are friendly and very helpful when I could not make a proper booking for 7 pax. They responded quickly to me emails, and also called me to confirm the no. of pax patronizing. Food was pretty good although a little bit pricey, and the place is welcoming and spacious. Would be back to try other food items! Thank you! =
5
Pancakes were amazing. The sides were a little small though for the amount you're paying. But the food was great and the service was quick
5
Pancakes ard fluffy and the maple butter complemented it perfectly. Ice box pie combined peanut butter with dark chocolate gauche beautifully.
5
Not my first visit to Clinton, they serve really good food and good coffee! Their food is decently priced.
4
Good brunch but they taken out the "Rosti" from menu which always my favorite:( atmosphere a bit noisy but is still ok!
1
A small disagreement over whether the fries were burnt. Which from a customer’s perspective been easily put right but wasn’t. I won’t be returning.
5
It’s always a joyful treat for myself to have their omelette with the yummy hash brown. They offer free coffee during weekday breakfast time!
4
shop was easy to find.
pancake was awesome but could give more jam or spread some jam in between pancake.
4
Pancakes! Yum! Always my fav! Wish they have more pancakes varieties. More salads & sandwiches.. visit again!
3
If you fancy your fried chicken or a decent hash, this joint is perfect for you. They do seem to do their fried food well; the buttermilk chicken was still tender, my hash was moist with butter but crisp on the outside. I was appreciative of the swope made by the kitchen to replace my toast with hash because not many places are flexible in this aspect. Reasonably priced, nice setting to catch up with friends, but horrid parking situation.
3
Went there for brunch as it seems to be a famous cafe. It has long queue for brunch time, the day we went the famous fried chicken waffles is not available. hence i tried the pancake. It is nice and so far i think is the best but also very expensive for a pancake to cost almost $20
3
I was 15mins early than my reservation time, I was happy that i was given an available seats without having to wait. Food is average but I had an enjoyable time with my Friend.
5
Super fluffy pancakes & yummy milkshakes. Huge portion size, so would recommend sharing! Go early & spend the rest of the day walking it off!
4
The atmosphere was nice, on weekends they get pretty crowded so reservation is required,
Portions were too large and they substitution of sides to a healthier option, despite being available in the menu
4
Great choice for lunch gatherings with friends. Fried chicken waffles and banana milkshake are highly recommended!
5
Lovely service , highly recommend ! Delicious food :)
Enjoy the enivoroment and music there.
My 2nd times come back here.
4
Great place for all day brunch. Their famous chicken and waffles live up to their reputation. Chicken was nice fried and tender while waffle was slightly crispy outside and soft inside.
4
The breakfast offerings were really tasty. Long queue though and prices are on the high side. Well but for the food quality, it was worth it.
4
Been here a few times.. Love the butter fried chicken every single time. Nice place for brunches and afternoon tea with friends!
3
Been wanting to try out this place again after 1st time couple of years ago, thus when there's offer decided to buy it and check it out with the ladies for lunch. Food was not bad though I would say the service can be slightly better. Glad that now we can make reservations but still place is still that crowded as compared to last round went I'm there.Definitely a good place to chill out with friends though pricing of the food is slightly on the higher side for a cafe
5
I was there with my siblings to celebrate our brother's birthday. Reserved a table because it was a weekend and I didn't want to be stuck waiting for one. It was our first visit and I think it is safe to say that we will be back for another.The food was superb. I've not had maple syrup in a while (the typical high fructose corn syrup version anyway), so I was skeptical of the maple butter they served. But oh my goodness, I think it's become my most favorite syrup of all and now I wish it's sold in a bottle!We were pleasantly surprised to find that Clinton St Baking offered mimosas although we hoped they would consider offering a bottomless mimosa option. Still a perfect brunch place, nonetheless, with plenty of options for the discerning.Other favorites include: all the egg dishes in the mains (one of our choices involved an omelette bigger than my brother's hand -- and his hand is big to begin with), the scones (fabulous!) and the Black & White milkshake.P.S. It's not a quiet place of any sort so if you prefer to have brunch with a noiseless setting, you may skip this
3
Tried the signature fried chicken. Quite average. However, Service was prompt and the atmosphere is suitable for big groups.
5
Love the pancakes! Fluffy and soft. Chicken and waffles was superb. Chicken was cooked nicely. Waffles was soft and heavenly when matched with the honey!
3
Mains like waffle chicken and pancakes are good. The cakes are lousy and aren't flavourful. Come on weekdays is better
4
Food is on the pricey side, but the buttermilk chicken, milk shakes and the peanut ice box cake are really good.
5
Great foods with great service. A little bit crowded on weekend but overall was good. Will be back again soon!
4
The blueberry pancakes were awesome! The buttermilk chicken was the best. But unfortunately we were served by a waiter that was alittle grumpy when the restaurant was not even half full on a rainy evening that we went.
4
Good food though I find service can be better. No smiley faces. Cafe is small so make sure go off peak or reserve. Prices a bit on the high side.
5
Pancakes are the best! The food are of very good quality! It is so crowded though so reservation is recommended.
4
Hung out with some friends and we had to try their highly raved pancakes and chicken & waffles. We were not disappointed. Pancakes were served hot, fluffy and soft, it paired perfectly with the maple/butter syrup! Overall, we loved the food they served, sharing some pictures to tease your taste buds. Will definitely head back there again. The only thing I couldnâ€™t quite get my head around was that, they close at 9PM on a Friday night, which I would say was pretty early
2
This was my third time visiting. All other occasion I've ordered pancakes and coffee which have been fine. This time we went back for lunch. It ordered an ice mocha and a chicken sandwich. partner ordered a latte and a cheeseburger. We split the French Toast. When the ice mocha was brought to the table I alerted the waiter that there was no coffee taste, it was incredibly milky with cocoa powder on top and chocolate sauce on the bottom. The didn't ask if I wanted to swap etc just rudely told me, "there's already two shots" and walked off (for $7.50). I didn't touch the drink and we were still charged. The latte was fine. Both main dishes were bland with no seasoning. The French Toast was ok, but for $17++ I don't think it's worth it. It's such a shame that their food menu doesn't match their pancakes. Their customer service is awful. Such a shame as this place has huge potential
4
Beautiful dining space, clean and neat (toilet as well). Food portions are big and delicious. Most of the dishes hits the spot. Service is fast and efficient as well.
3
Had Waffle Chicken and French Toast. Waffle chicken was great, tender chicken with crispy skin and fluffy waffle. French Toast was ok for that price. Syrup was rather over powering and got sick of it after while. Probably best to share with someone.
3
I had salmon burger and grilled chicken sandwich and they are pretty normal/common including its pancakes. Nothing really fantastic and caught my taste bud. Too bad, the award winning cake was sold out.
4
We had omelette and blueberry pancakes. Though pricey at least it was delicious. The omelette especially was very well done... finished every bit of it.
5
It's my second visit and the food never failed. The pancakes, still as fluffy as ever and the little ones loved them so much. The breakfast which I had, the Spanish Scramble was very well done too, lots of cheese and sausage to make it very wholesome. Service was prompt and fast. Will be back again
4
This is a valuable discovery in Purvis Street, which is a franchise from the US.Firstly, the menu items are a delight. Eggs/omelette, sandwiches, pancakes, cakes, pies and many others. There is something for everyone in the family. Taste was truly good, especially the house omelette specialty which contains 3 eggs with ham and tomatoes, served with hash browns and 2 bread slices. Serving size is good for sharing. I paired this dish with a hot cup of peppermint tea. I can also recommend the 3-layered pancake with fresh bananas and caramelized walnut. Very filling. Next, many of the usual breakfast items can be ordered all day. I guess the menu has gained quite a following of regular patrons.Lastly, they have good service. Despite being full of diners, the waitresses are able to take orders quickly and serve orders relatively fast
3
Good brunch selection however the restaurant is too crowded and the servers were not too friendly from showing us to our seat to making payment. It wasn't a very pleasant experience when the table were not properly cleaned and when we politely asked for extra serviette, the server reluctantly responded
4
My friend and I decided to have lunch here on a Saturday. We had tried to reserve a table online the day before but there were no available times. We decided to take a chance and show up. Luckily there were about 4-5 tables empty and since there were only 2 of us, we got seated immediately. If you plan to go on the weekend, would highly suggest booking in advance at least a few days before. The menu is bigger than expected and we found ourselves having trouble deciding what to order. Everything looked (we spied on our neighbors' tables) and sounded great. My friend ordered a country breakfast which came with a biscuit. Note if you want jam, then you have to pay extra. I had the smoked salmon rosti. The portions are American-sized brunch style, similar to the nice brunch places in Chicago and New York. The prices are not too bad but expect to pay about $30-40 per person which includes a drink and a main. The service was good. They had many staff walking around. The only time we waited quite a while was for the settling the payment. It took at least 15 mins after we gave over our credit cards until we got them back. We were just about to chase them for it when it finally came back. Would definitely go back to try more of their food.
5
This was my second visit. I absolutely love their fluffy stack of blueberry pancakes and very special maple syrup. If there was anything I would change - I'd suggest a more generous serving of blueberry sauce over that gorgeous stack of pancakes. Chicken and waffles were also to die for. Chicken was crispy and hearty. Maple syrup was a perfect accompaniment. Must have both when you visit
5
This is the second time visit to this restaurant. Bring my best friend to try their blueberries pancake and we order one main course buttermilk fried chicken. Food come with big portion and we love the buttermilk chicken , not too oily and enough for two pax .Dinner time was too crowded and walking gap between seat is too narrow. Overall excellent experience and money worth on the food part 
1
If you want to know how 'suit to local taste' is such a bad idea for restaurants coming in to Singapore, this is it.
5
Excellent food and service. I really liked how the staff was able to recommend the milkshake when we asked. I will definitely come again.
4
Really love their fried chicken waffles so came back again to eat! Although this time, the maple butter wasn't as nice as the first time I tried it.. not even butter perhaps?
4
Food is good as always. Price is reasonable. Always crowded. It is my second visit and will definitely visit again.
5
Really delicious pancakes with blueberry sauce and waffles and fried chicken. Good service and affordable prices.
5
The blueberry pancakes is a must try. Hearty portion that comes with generous amount of blueberry compote and maple syrup. Best to share.
5
I tried the blueberry pancake & farmer's plate. Food was served hot and it was great. Service was good too, the staff will constantly refill your water when they see that your cup is almost empty. Can't wait for my next visit!
3
Restaurant was quite crowded when we visited at 2pm on a Saturday. Music was too loud, and we were seated so close to other guests that everyone had to shout to be able to hear each other. We were packed like sardines and unfortunately servers could not pass through our chairs, and I had to keep getting up to allow them to pass. Food was ok, but for the price I expected alot more. Won't be coming back.
5
Visited with family and a baby in pram. Although a little cramp but there was space to accomodate the pram.We were served promptly to our table and food was also served pretty fast. We had order the chicken sandwich, chicken and waffles as well as the angus burger. Both chicken dishes were great, which in turn made the angus burger a little underwhelming. Cold brew coffee was good and the desserts were delicious.The price was affordable as the portions were bigger than normal and satisfying. Will definitely visit again
4
I went here for brunch with my friend that was visiting from the States. Very similar to brunch spots in the US, i.e. a bit of a wait, similar decor, modern-vibe. They also have wifi, which helps with the wait. We sat at the bar and had a shorter waiting time. The food was pretty good. Also had the cheesecake, also great. Prices are also similar to the states; my choice was pretty small but my friend had the chicken and waffles and that was a pretty decent-sized portion. Staff was very patient while my friend and I sat for a while. Would go back to try a few different items on the menu. Very nice location, not too far from Haji Lane and Raffles Hotel.
3
Had the blueberries pancake (3 pancakes!) And chicks and waffle.
The waffle wasn't the crispy kind and tasted like the pancakes but in a diff shape.
Pancakes was not bad but too much pancakes for one serving.
3
The portions served are very big. So 2 people can share one portion. Food is good and filling. Reaonably priced for the food portion.
5
Back here again and their pancakes didn't disappoint :') loved their buttermilk biscuit and sweet potato fries sides as well!!
4
We ordered the chicken & waffles and salmon scramble. Salmon scramble was very normal, nothing special. Chicken and waffles was interesting with the maple butter. However the taste was alright, nothing extraordinary.
3
Menu had a wide variety of breakfast, lunch items & drinks. However, the layout of the place was very cramped and it was very noisy. Definitely not the ambience for couples; better for girl groups.
4
tried the pancakes quite nice and nice place to chill with your friends. good first try but might not go back again.
4
Chicken that came with waffles was really soft and tender. Not the hard and double fried taste. Excellent.
Waffles were fluffy and soft. Excellent.
Hope it stays this way.
4
Luckily we made a reservation as it was very crowded. Food was pretty good. Salmon rosti dish was not the biggest. Overall good
3
Fairly good standard pancakes to start off, but could not taste the special wow factor that impressed many before me. 3 thick, fluffy and moist pancakes with standard blueberry (they were juicy and succulent I must say) and a tub of melted butter infused with maple syrup. Sorry but it wasn't specially nice, or flavourful. Tried the Farmer's Breakfast also, where the ingredients are of good quality, the scrambled eggs, sourdough bread, avocado and only the pork patties stood out for its unique aroma and taste.Ordered a side of ham steak, and for $6, I cannot complain about the generous portions with good bite to it. Do order a coffee as they do theirs with toasty dark nuts aroma and a memorable palate.The downfall will be the crowd on a weekend brunch, not so much the mass of humanity, but the proximity 1 table is to another. I can hear the conversations besides and behind me throughout the time at the shop. Air-conditioning can be improved as the stuffiness approaching noon time, was snooze-inducing
3
Tried to call the restaurant thrice a few days back but no one picked up the phone. Strange. Finally decided to make a reservation through Chope instead. Ordered 3 mains; Clinton St. Omelette (2 choices of fillings out of 7 available types) $20, Grilled Chix Sandwich $19 and Blueberries Pancakes $19. The Clinton St. Omelette was passable.  Chix Sandwich had avocado slices passable too. Now, the Blueberries Pancake was simple, thick and soft. Three pieces of pancakes stacked. It's drip with blueberries, it's syrup and sugar powder. Yummy! :DBUT!!! Noted plenty of other diners whom did not clean their plate of pancakes. :P whoops??!! Too filling? 3 side dishes; Hashbrown $7, Hand Cut Fries $7 and Two Eggs Any Style (Scambled) $6. Side dishes are way over priced! Small servings especially the hash brown. 1 dessert; Black & White Layer Cakes $8. The staff recommended this cake as one of the top sellers. Tasted and I have no comments. (Mind you, I love desserts... Am trying to be polite here :D)The place was really busy and well staffed with friendly floor waitresses. I guess it's because of the hype for their famous pancakes & chicken waffles. Bill $102. There was no queue for payment at the cashier but we were kept waiting waiting ... Sunday afternoon parking at Purvis street is a hot & slow. Finally, will I come back? Yup! I have to try that other cake I saw in their display and the Buttermilk Chix. Will not be ordering any sides as its a total waste of money
4
Pancakes were fluffy and soft as usual. Spanish scramble was yummy, well seasoned eggs! Restaurant was pretty full on a PH but worth the wait!
5
I love the omelette a lot and will visit at least once a month. The brew coffee is bottomless too. They have weekday breakfast deals which I love.
5
Delish! Breakfast all day. The burgers look good too. Not busy early. I'm a cappuccino guy. They do a very smooth cappuccino.
4
This is my third time back in CSBC, always happy to be back for sweet treats. this is the best place for fluffy pancakes!
4
All day breakfast for big eaters!! Fried Chicken Sandwich, Chicken & Waffles & many more awesome food!! =)
4
Went here to catch up with my friends. The food was great, night atmosphere as well. will be back for it's nice ambience
4
Food is good too. Repeat visit. Serving appears to have reduced in size. We needed to have one and half main meals to feel satisfied

I clearly indicated that I'd like a corner table when I made the reservations but this request was blatantly ignored. Nonetheless, I accepted a table next to a crowd of more than 10pax and my entire lunch was disturbed by bad behavior from other patrons. It was very annoying & I hope that when I return next, my request will be granted.The food & coffee was near perfection, just that the experience was really lous
5
Me and my friend walked pass this place by accident and we were so happy that we decided to walk in and give it a try!The pancake was absolutely delicious, so is the chicken waffle. Our black coffees were ON THE HOUSE , as apparently it comes with the breakfasts sets.. THe service was really good too... also, they have an amazing toilet! amazing interior and cleanliness
4
This was my second visit. In both visits, cold drip coffee was said to be sold out, although it was only about noon!Portions of the mains were medium-sized. I found the pancakes alright, but I really liked the fried chicken on waffles.They are currently having a lunch promotion (50% off every 2nd main course), which was helpful as the prices are about 20-30% higher than other cafes of similar standard
4
Had the eggs Benedict and veggie sandwich with my Wife. It was ok but a bit pricey without any offers. They are closed on weekday nights so Friday or Saturday nights are onl time they are open for dinner!
2
Quantity has lessen quite alot. Service isn't as good. Staff will question your orders on why you would make such orders. Haggling attitude.
5
Food served in large portion. Ambience was great for casual dining with friends or family. Service could be more attentive though. But overall was a pleasant dining experience for first time diner like me.
4
Signature blueberry maple pancakes is good, nice ambience. Very pleasant to enjoy high tea or a place to relax
4
The american breakfast certainly is good here, but the prices are quite high to match. The cheapest breakfast comes in at S$17, although I have to admit that it is a decent portion that I definitely could not finish. For 3 people who don't have massive appetites, you could easily get away with ordering 2 breakfast dishes to share between the 3 of you, which ultimately, if you did would make this place relatively affordable. Capuccinos will set you back S$6 each (even more expensive than in Australia by about 50%) and for me, the coffee is quite strong but certainly not offensive. Staff were friendly enough and the food was served in a timely manner. Also, we didn't seem to have an issue getting a table for breakfast during the weekday

Loved this place! I ordered the strawberry pancakes (on special) and my hubby ordered the eggs. The pancakes were so fluffy and the sweetness was perfectly offset by the citrus taste in the sponge cake. The coffee for me, however, was the highlight. By far the most amazing coffee I have ever tried in a restaurant/cafe. What this place lost marks on was the layout of the restaurant. Unfortunately, I don't know if we will bring our children here on our next visit. It was very loud and if you have bad hearing like I do, it echoes like no tomorrow.
5
Both pancakes and waffles were extremely good. The buttermilk fried chicken which came together with the waffles was just right in terms of meat and batter thickness. Unless you are really really into sweet stuff, I suggest you go easy on the sugar-coated bacon because everything else is gonna be sweet. My wife and I had the raspberry ripple milkshake and the salted caramel milkshake which were really great. But you could imagine the amount of sweet stuff we already had.
5
Had my birthday dinner there and it did not disappoint. The fried chicken was moist inside and crispy outside. It was cooked to perfection. The pancake, voted as the best was indeed truly the best. Fluffy and tender, with the maple syrup and toppings u choose, it was sure to satisfy the true pancake lovers
5
My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out after purchasing the voucher under Chope's birthday promotion. The place is easily accessible and I like the layout of the restaurant. The food? Even better. My boyfriend tried their Eggs benedict served on biscuits and I had Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich which was absolutely delicious. Definitely will go again..
5
This is the second time I had meal there. We ordered fried chicken and waffle and chicken burger. Food came pretty fast despite of busy lunch hours on Friday. Chicken was crispy and juicy. It was really good. A bit disappointed with the waffles as I prefer it to be crispy and it was soft. Burger was huge and value for money. Crispy chicken and fluffy buns. I will definitely go back again.
3
The pancakes were fluffy and tasted good. The egg benedicts were disappinting! The oj was of a smaller size than I thought.
5
I'm not usually a fan of buttermilk pancakes as they are usually dense and not fluffy... but none of this was a letdown in their stack of buttermilk pancakes!
3
The restaurant was very crowded and somewhat noisy. But the orders came quickly and the portions were big.
4
Great place for pancakes and a nice American brunch. There can be quite a queue during the weekends so do make a booking
5
A great team at Clinton st baking company. Food was great and service was prompt. I truly enjoyed it
5
I've been here 3 times within a month, Their fluffy pancake and chicken waffle were nice with clean environment, the service was also very good especially for kids.
5
Pleasant restaurant, attentive and polite staff, good food. Cakes were delicious, had the Pineapple Upside Down cake and Peanut Butter Ice Box Pie.
4
fluffy pancakes and the syrup was so good, not too sweet and perfect! my partner had the spanish scrambled and it as mixed with chorizo and it was so good as well with sourdough. attentive staff as well.
3
Came here for lunch yesterday with some colleagues. I opted for the rosti which was very tasty but a tiny serve, so I ended up being hungry later in the afternoon. Service was a bit haphazard with our meals arriving at quite different times. Relatively expensive for what you get. Don't think I'll be back
3
Went there twice but the standard of the food depends on the dish ordered, some was tasty but some were just mediocre. Blueberry pancakes - fluffy and thick with a nice texture, slightly undercooked when it came though. It was tasteless when eaten plain but with the blueberry sauce and maple butter, it tasted pretty yummy. Would be better if they serve REAL blueberries instead of the canned ones.Milkshakes - Peanut butter tasted artificial. Banana one was refreshing and great.Salmon with Rosti - rosti came overcooked, with a lot of burned edges. Would be better if it came in 1 large slice instead of 3 small ones because the oil tasted greasy and with smaller slices, it was worse.Sugar cured bacon - sinfully and tasty but a little pricey, $7 for the small amount.Omelette (main) - extremely large portion, worth it, tasted hearty and delicious. Ice earl grey tea - it was surprisingly refreshing and there WAS a fair amount of earl grey taste even without sugar syrup.3 eggs and ham (main) - the sunny side up option came with the 3 eggs was cooked stuck together. Disappointingly undercooked for the yolks, this should be a no brainer. Scone was the savior, delicious and light, but it came plain without any jam nor butter. The ham and hash brown were just something to fill up the plate, not delicious but still not that bad.Farmers plate with pork sausage - the pork sausage was undercooked and pinkish. We checked with the server but he asked the kitchen and they claimed that it WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PINK on the inside, yes and pork patty you heard me! What's worst was it wasn't evenly cooked so some parts was greyish and some parts pinkish. LOL. The dish was generous though but doesn't come with standard. Overall the mains were more or less of the same repeating ingredients (hash brown, eggs, bacon etc) just that they mixed it all up. The scone was amazing, other than that the food was pretty normal and a little overpriced
4
Staff did not even apologize when we highlighted there was a fly in the drink. Would have expected better service. Food was good.
4
Quantity does make up for the higher than average price however serving size is bigger than the average local. If it's priced lower with slightly lesser quantity that'll be optimal.
3
Services was rather average, food wise is rather average.
As for pan cake, it was surprising good...
4
We had the legendary pancakes with blueberry sauce and it did not disappoint. Though I find the farmer's plate a little underwhelming and not value for the price.
4
Nice place for friends catch up. Not ideal for couples for romantic meal as the tables are too near each other. Overall food is ok with friendly staff.
4
Good breakfast set and omelette. Rich and flavourful with generous fillings. Highly recommended !!! :)
3
Went back for the second time because I enjoyed my first visit. This time round the waitress was rude, impatient, got the wrong order and the place was noisy.
1
Second time here, had dinner at 8; place closed on us (turned off lights, air conditioning) whilst we were finish up on our meal; practically chased us out of the restaurant.
Food was mediocre; desserts were dry.
5
My first visit there was when they had just opened, and that was a disappointment in terms of service and food. But i am so glad to have given them another shot. My recent visit was awesome. The food was very good, and service was too. I would definitely be back for more.If all day breakfasts and fried chicken is your thing, you shld definitely visit soon
4
Tried their signature pancakes and it really lived up to its expectation moist fluffy and delicious and the portion was really good enough for two to share! Tho price is a little pricey- $19 for pancakes service and atmosphere make up for it .Really looking forward to try their chicken and waffles on the next visit
5
Attentive staff, consistent standard of food. Our 5th time visiting. So far never disappointed. Will definitely call again.
5
My second visit here, and I love the food. It's a great place to chill and relax, and of course, all-day breakfasts!
4
Reservation made using chope with chope vouchers used. Food was good and pancakes were pretty nice! Well worth with vouchers used. However, it gets a little noisy when the restaurant is full.
5
Nice ambience! Good food! Friendly staff! The pie was superb! Peanut butter wasn't overpowering. Very enjoyable.
4
Although expensive (anything having to do with western food in Singapore will be expensive) it is a treat worth the money. The pancakes were flat out delicious and there were plenty of them. Genuinely good stuff - oh, and good coffee too.
5
Best pancakes!! Must try 👍👍👍
Fluffy pancakes coupled with blueberries topping, wow me right from the first mouth!
4
portions were huge. came with friends, enjoyed the strawberry cream pancakes. Got a bit jialat towards the end so do come prepared to share your food. only gripe was they made me wait for 30 mins despite making a reservation >:
2
We visited on a weekend evening, the restaurant was not overly crowded. We ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken on Waffles. Both entrees were dry and the flavors were one-dimensional. The restaurant seems to have improved on the size of the chicken on the waffle- the combination worked well but would have been better with a side salad- even a few leaves or tomatos would make the dish less dry. The grilled chicken sandwich featured good ingredients but would have been much better with some sort of spread.The food served would disappoint at a typical American diner. At these prices, Clinton St aligns itself with the emerging cafe fad in Singapore rather than its New York namesake
3
The well known fluffy pancakes lived up to expectations indeed but the buttermilk fried chicken were quite ordinary at best. The portions of both dishes were generous though and we had a satisfactorily filling dinner. On an aside, I liked the well lit restaurant. Too many restaurants there days are too dim and hardly enough light to admire the beauty of food
3
Had a blueberry pancake and a salmon burger. The total price for these two items alone came to about $50. Fortunately, I had a voucher purchased for $35 from a recent promotion. The food was only so so and I would consider it overpriced unless you can obtain a similar promotion
5
The food was delicious and the service provided was very good. The Chope reservation made it fuss free and need not wait in the queue.
4
the breakfast menu could be expanded( waffle was only available after 11am) . The ambience and service are really good.
4
Clean and simple interior, clearly the
focus was on the quality of the food! The chicken in the waffle and chicken was so so tender and the pancakes were one of the best for us!
4
We tried a few dishes here, all breakfast items, they have good coffee and a good food menu, service was great. Definitely worth the try.
5
we got the banana walnut pancakes, and added chocolate chips to it. a really great combination!! their chicken & waffles were really yummmy too! also be sure to try the jalepeno corn bread, but you can give the fries a miss- they were too salty
4
Had the chicken and waffles which was delightful. However, the salmon burger was not really to my liking.
4
Servings were generous and food was of quality. Place was bustling with people even for a weekday. Visit would have been made perfect if not for the cashier's mistake during bill settlement which resulted in quite abit of inconvenience.
5
I tried their signature blueberries pancake last year in NYC. The Singapore branch version was nice, but not as good as I recall to their original NYC version. Having said that, the Singapore version can be said to be the best pancakes you can find in Singapore. The omelet was good with liquidy center and sweet potato fries were just okay. The buttermilk chicken itself was underwhelming but the waffle so good you can eat it alone. Portions are huge so share with your family/friends. Latte was good but that's it. As for the decor, I feel it's too simple and lack warmth. Service was overall great. Already visited a few times and would still love to come back
5
Shared chicken & waffle, blueberries waffle pancakes and sweet potato fries with 2 other friends on a leisurely Saturday afternoon. The food was good ole American diner fare with portions to match (with the exception of the sweet potato fries which was pricey for the portion served). The ambience was bright and nice and we were offered seats at the booth at the back - best seats in the house in my opinion. Overall, good food that on the pricey side
3
- No waiting time as we have made reservation. However, due to our observation the seating capacity was only less than 50% occupied so I guess walk-ins should be accepted.- Was greeted with friendliness (1 male and 1 female staff) - Food was well presented and portion was huge.- Nice ambience but a little too bright. - As we were wrapping up to make payment, we prompted the chinese male waiter that we have a e-voucher to use in my phone. I was informed that the e-voucher needs to be verified by the Supervisor (Kenneth) , hence he requested to have my phone for the supervisor to verify. I declined as the phone contains personal information and my privacy. Thus, waiter was unsure and look over to the Supervisor whom was standing next to the bar counter, which was just 2 tables away from where we were seated. Subsequently, waiter looked over at the Supervisor as he was unsure of the procedure and than he walk over to consult him. Finally, Supervisor was willing to walk over to the table to settle our bill. I showed him the e-voucher and he said any balance amount needs to paid by cash. I was puzzled as the amount was only $48 and doesn't require any top up. Following on, he make eye contact wanting me to pass him the bill which was left on the table, when he could reach it for himself. After reaching for the receipt and he realised theres was no topping up required. He didn't bother to acknowlege, apologize or thanking us for making the payment. There was simply no acknowledgement for patrons and he has a very negative body language. All in all, I felt both the waiter and waitress (believe to be part timers) possessed a better attitude than the Supervisor. He should at least have the courtesy, after all he's in the service industry and thats the minimum to ask for. The Supervisor should learn from both of the part timers. Patrons should visit their official FB page for feedbacks should they decide to visit this cafe
3
Food was the usual long wait but taste was disappointing a compared to 1st visit. Food was cold and the salmon buger was really salty
2
The meal I've ordered was good, but way too expensive. Taking into consideration that I had to order bread separately and was charged additionally is a disgrace for that price level. No recommendation. Customer satisfaction not achieved. I feel ripped off.
3
Pancakes were fluffy and big. The portion would easily serve two people. The tables were too near each other. The plates too big to fit the small tables.
5
Clinton street lives up to the hype with its soft and fluffy pancakes and chicken waffles! The maple syrup was yummy and wasn't overly sweet or greasy either!
5
I've been here 4-5 times within the last six months and have always ordered the same food - blueberry pancakes and chicken & waffles and they are excellent everytime! Love having brunch there!
5
Chicken and waffles was excellent! Waffles were fluffy , fried chicken was crunchy n seasoned well! Will try the pancakes next
4
Overall a good experience, food came pretty quickly and was served hot. The staff will also be a constant look out on what you need
2
The tables in the restaurant are placed too close apart for comfort. Local coffee shops are a lot more spacious. Paid more than 50 bucks for 2 mains. The burger was tasteless.
4
Ordered the signature chicken w waffles (my first time having chix + waffles!) and it was good! The chicken was tender and the waffles were fluffy. However the Strawberry Rhubarb Lemonade was too sour for our liking, I wouldn't order it again. My favourite thing about the restaurant is the atmosphere. It brings a different vibe and was not too crowded when I visited on a Saturday night.
3
had Huevos Rancheros and Buttermilk Fried Chicken Plate for lunch, portion was great ion for two person. happy to see Mexican breakfast option available in the menu.Highly recommend the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Plate, the meat was juicy and bursting with flavours. The jalapeÃ±o corn bread was lovely.
5
Food was delicious and service was wonderful. I will definitely return to try the other dishes of the menu.
4
The pancake is very yummy although it's on the pricier side considering that pancake is easy to make. The all-day breakfast is a nice way to reward a busy week. Good for gathering but must remember to reverse as seats are limited.
4
Had their blueberry & choc chip special pancake and it was good! It's seasonal though so you can only order it this month I think.
4
Service is good. The chicken portions appear to have shrunk. Hope the servings can be of better value soon
4
The blueberry Pancakes were fantastic- the best I've had! Pancakes were soft and fluffy, but filling. The warm maple syrup butter was very smooth and paired beautifully with the pancakes.
4
I use the Chope voucher which is 50 percent off pancake and chicken waffle is really nice and service good too
5
Amazing brunch- eggs, cookies, milkshake everything was absolutely perfect. The biscuit that comes along with the egg is a must try
4
The Food is good and the pancake is great! However, can improve in their cold brew coffee. Will go back for their mains next time.
5
The buttermilk chicken waffle is a must try. My Fiancé even loved the warm water they serve as it as a coffee taste to it.
5
The blueberry pan cake really worth to try . Taste good and big portion . It cost SGD 19 dollars and consider abit expensive.
5
Their pancakes are absolutely delicious and fluffy but the portion is extremely huge! Had the cold brew coffee as well.
3
Their supposedly famous pancakes were rather than dense instead of being light and fluffy. Would rather get their blondie sundae
5
Food was really great! Also, loved the atmosphere. Will definitely come back to try the other food in their menu. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
4
Went there one morning for breakfast
Ordered pancakes and rosti .. the portion of the rosti was miserable but the pancakes is good and the portion is enough for 2 to share but its rather costly for just both items
5
In a city with moody service this place was great. Extremely friendly staff and really great food. Cake portions too big even for a greedy person
5
We had pancakes and chicken waffles, both were lovely. However it was really crowded on a PH afternoon so service was slow. Still, the waitresses make it up by being very friendly! Will come again but not at a peak period.
4
Had brunch with 2 other girl friends on a weekday. Pleasant decor (clean feel and bright), service is decent; pretty ideal for brunch and get-together with friends.
4
I first came here last year when I heard Singapore had a branch. Ironically even though I'm from NYC I've never been to the original so made an effort to check out this place based on reviews from friends. I wasn't disappointed. I've been back several times mostly with anywhere from 2-4 children, a perfect place for kids. The portions are good sized so sharing the pancakes, French toast, egg dishes was perfect. It's an unassuming but solid establishment that very much reminds me of the States, i.e. home away from home. My go to breakfast place especially with kids
4
Service is very fast as we were seated on entering the cafe even at 9:00 am on a public holidays .Great choices of food as you get both the sweet and savory which we decided on the savory. Lots of eggs in most of the dishes and even for my father who is not a fan of western breakfast finished up his plate of food.Only set back would be the price for a breakfast and one of the side dish which we ordered , onion rings, which is a disaster in my view. Bland and what you get to taste is the coating and not the onion rings. Will be back next time for the pancakes
5
We visited for breakfast about 8:30am this morning and were pleasantly surprised to find it not crowded on this holiday morning. It did get more crowded as we were there, though. I had the blueberry pancakes, my husband the banana walnut pancakes and my son the chocolate chunk pancakes. I have honestly never had pancakes so fluffy and good! Loved the maple butter, also! The portions are really too big for one person so we were all unable to finish. The only drawback as others have mentioned is that the tables were very close together. We will definitely be back
5
Came with my wife looking for a delicious breakfast to get energized for a long day. Mission accomplished! The waffles were just amazing, eggs were delicious and the place is so nice. It is pricy but worth the money. Definitely ecommended.
4
Food was ok. Location was excellent. We took advantage of a promotion to get $25 off $50 voucher. We would consider coming back if there are similar promotions in future
3
This morning we had breakfast here. Overall quality of foods was good but not exceptionally good but the serving was generous. Service quite good too. We asked the leftovers to be put in the box and they did it nicely. A bit pricey too.
4
Great food. Huge portions. Can get really noisy. Table are placed very close to one another, can't help hearing other tables conversations.
4
Pancakes is the signature, undeniable is always good. When you need a healthier option, look for omelette and substitute with egg white. It's so delicious!
2
The restaurant was extremely packed on a Friday night and we got reminded through phone calls & booking sites that we have to be on time. Food came and because the 5 of us were sharing plates and sides to have a taste of the much accredited menu, we took our time to enjoy the dinner. The waiters are constantly trying to clear your plates and we told them twice that 'We are not done", just before we realised, the plates and cutlery before us were gone after ending an engrossed conversation when there were still food on some main plates and more of the sides! Decided not to ask for new plates anyway because the food was not that great that you want to finish them. Food rating + dining experience do not justify the price that an individual has to pay; $40 -50 (plus 1 drink
5
Second visit here, had banana walnut pancakes. The pancakes were soft and fluffy, with a rich butter taste. Admittedly the banana walnut pancake, on its own without the sauce, can be a little dry unlike the blueberry one. Separately not sure why the cafe has a policy that we can't be seated until all the guests have arrived. I would have had my friend order for me and consequently spend less time occupying the table. Perhaps something to consider.
3
The food is not bad. The ambiance is nice. Clean environment. Staff are quite helpful too. Just that there was a small hiccup. We were using Chope Voucher and the value is S$100. They did not show us the bill and straight away offset against the voucher. Our total bill came up to S$92++, including Service Charge and GST. We just took it as they used to offset the whole bill and we still have remaining S$8.00. We feel that they should have shown us the bill before offset it, because we may wanna use up the remaining balance. Because if their practice is the same with other restaurants, our remaining balance will be S$20+++, because the voucher is to be offset against the subtotal bill, excluding Service Charge and GST. This remaining balance of $20+++ would be sufficient for us to order another main course. In the end, we did ask them about the remaining balance of S$8 and out of goodwill they gave us a muffin and a scone to offset against it. I feel that the restaurant should inform the customers regarding the remaining balance and not just quietly offset it against the bill, because it is unfair to the customer. And also I think that the management should make it clear that whether the voucher can offset against the whole bill or the subtotal excluding service charge and GST. I think the customers have the rights to know.
5
What a delicious find in Singapore! A friend told me to try breakfast and I was happy she did. The place is always busy at breakfast on the weekends so I ended up sitting at the bar. I ordered the Southern breakfast which included eggs, bacon, a biscuit, and fried green tomatoes! Everything was excellent, but the fried green tomatoes were a little bit of heaven. This is definitely a return destination for me
4
Very delicious stack of 3 blueberries pancake. Light and fluffy, so far the best for me. I wish it is served with whipped cream though. Just me. We also ordered the Angus beef burger with Swiss cheese. Taste normal nothing outstanding to mention. Very noisy place. No idea why people talking so loudly.
4
the pancakes, as usual, are a staple of the place. soft, fluffy, extremely filling. and the maple butter is to-die-for. the huevos rancheros are good too, but i wish there was more tortilla to mop up the ingredients
3
Great atmosphere. Definitely dazzled by the mixed British-European-American concept. Not forgetting the well battered chicken with tasty waffle and flavorful pancakes (counted as a main course) that we had.
3
It wasn't as exclusive as stated on their site. No doubt the food was not bad, but it feels like a market place as it was noisy. Overall food was good. Service was okay.
4
It is a small cafe with very bright lighting. Set up withSlightly dark wooden furnitures. Serves all day breakfast
5
Was there on a weekday for lunch. Ordered blueberries pancake and chicken & waffles. Both were good!
4
I'm not a big fan of pancakes but if I were, the pancakes here would be my go-tos. Even as a non-pancake lover, I was impressed at their fluffiness and subtle sweetness. Two thumbs up!Also had the angus cheeseburger but I'd say, stick with the pancakes
4
The pancakes at Clinton Street are to die for, they are perfectly fluffy and come in a tall stack of 3- more than enough for one person. I would highly recommend coming here for the all-day breakfast.Our one complaint is that we also ordered a plate of the buttermilk fried chicken. The waitress told us it would be a 30 minute wait and we said that was fine, just bring the pancakes out first. She didn't place the chicken order and we had to order it again 10 minutes later. Meanwhile, a new party sat down next to us and got their chicken immediately.
1
I was expecting a fluffy and delicious pancake from this shop that's very famous for it. However, what I had was a horrible pancake;one that kills you after 3bites? It lacks of taste and the amount of leaving agents put in the batter I think is too much(they put wrong?) I could only managed to finish one stack out of the three! Because it just not tolerable anymore. As for the coffee, I ordered soy cappucino and it was terrible! Coffee/soy milk was way too hot and basically it just burns the taste of the coffee, they should know how to make a proper soy based coffee if they have it on the menu and not just make whatever to serve the customers. Overall I was so disappointed with their food and beverage here; too highly raved for something not worth your money(it's expensive!
4
The fried chicken went really well with the waffle and the maple butter was just heavenly. The eggs benedict was also really nice, together with the buttermilk biscuit, which is unlike usual eggs ben. However, we felt that the eggs ben sauce was abit too salty
1
Had read about restaurant so went with eagerness for a good experience - bit of a wait but got a phone call to say our table was available so good start. service friendly and prompt ordered 3 lemonades (nice) salted caramel shake (v.good) eggs (good) buttermilk chicken plate (good but needed seasoning). Kids ordered burgers - to start one had the wrong cheese and was sent back, my son then started eating his and was rare so this was also sent back. Waited 10-15 min for replacement burgers which were delivered by manager with apology - cut into beef patties and were both raw and bloody - waitress apologetic but manager and Chef were obviously lost for words because they just stared at me - decided to leave at this point to never return. Disappointed customer!
5
superb thick and fluffy pancakes, especially the one with blueberries!! buttered maple was delightful as well!
4
I ordered the same thing again and again. It was so good. Omelette with spinach and mushroom though I think they are barely see sometimes.
3
Southern style food. Good pancakes. Not sure about their crusty bread though. Wish they have more variety for their pancakes
3
Visiting this place for the 1st time. Seem like a popular spot with most tables taken. Staff recommended pancakes. Its a big serving for 1 but taste is just average. Pork was pink and didn't seem cooked enough for my taste. Staff are friendly and attentive .On my way out, like me I realize that patrons seem to leave a considerable amount of unfinished food.I would still go back and give it a chance with others on the menu
4
Food was good actually. But server didn't really attend to us when we put our hands up a few times. We wanted to ask for plates, pepper and salt but they did not attend to us and asked us to wait. In the end did not get back to us. So we self-service & went to take the plates, salt and pepper ourselves.
5
The pancakes is a must try!! Comes with choice of blueberries compote or choc chucks or banana walnut( choc chucks is delicious!!). Eggs Ben is cook to perfection with e egg yolk oozes out when u cut it!!!! A must try for all breakfast fanatics out ther
5
Just visited this classy joint with husband and friends for an early dinner at 5:30pm on a Saturday. We ordered 2 sets of their fried chicken and waffles with extra maple syrup butter.It's a heavy dish that can be shared amongst two, chicken breast was crispy and not too salty. Waffles were great and the maple butter syrup was to die for. Wait staff was super considerate, saw I was pregnant and without asking provided me with a glass of warm water. Didn't have to wait long for drinks and food to be served.Overall a delightful experience and I will return again in future. :
4
Went there for breakfast this morning. I had the 7 grain toast with butter & jam whilst the rest had pancakes with blueberries and banana with walnut. Another had the country breakfast.Pancakes were delicious & fluffy... you can share if you are a small eater and order a small side. The bacon that came with the other breakfast was unusual as it was salty/sweet.The hot chocolate was one of the best I have had. Oh yes the jam that came with my toast was very good.I thought the prices were a bit steep for breakfast and perhaps they could consider including a house coffee/tea with the main meal or have a choice of a set breakfast
3
Food are served in a big portion but personally think is overrated. Ordered brioche French toast, banana walnut pancake and egg Benedict. Presentation looking very good but the food taste so so only. Wanted to try the fried chicken buttermilk (11:15am) but the waitress said need to be wait for 45 mins. Menu stated we can order at 11:30am. Hot chocolate is nice but prefer Starbucks. Will come back again to try butter milk fried chicken
4
The place was packed from brunch, lunch till late afternoon. We were there from 130 pm to530pm. Crowd level was consistent. Most tables were filled. Food portions were good for one person. I hAd the scrambled eggs with salmon and greens. Not that impressed. Was expecting the scrambled eggs to be better. Salad on the side was quite blend but i asked for some light salad sauce to go with it. Service was good among some staff members and some were a bit lacklustr
4
A Typical American Diner Food. Portion is very big. If you order pancake better share. Try their homemade lemonade and Chicken Waffle. You will not regret.
5
I've been to the original in Manhattan and love a taste of Southern brunch in Singapore! Nice, fluffy pancakes and fried chicken with honey.
3
The decor was very thoughtfully designed, but the tables were a little too close to each other. Food is also average - looks better than it tastes

Was shown to table by very polite and friendly staff. Food was good and worth the value paid. Will visit again for the specials
4
Pancakes are moist and fluffy unlike many other cafes! Serving portions are good for groups. Would definitely be back.

Love the food here, it was all very tasty - however, the portions were so huge that we could not finish what we ordered! It was a bit much towards the end. Service was good here, the waitresses were all very friendly and attentive. We ordered the pancake special (maybe might be good to be able to order a half portion?), and the southern breakfast (loved the buttermilk biscuit!).One thing my friends and I wished was better in this place was the noise. Maybe it's too open and deep that the noise just resonates everywhere and it was quite bothersome to try and keep up with our own conversation. A friend even said that she was too distracted with the noise to concentrate on her meal
2
honestly the food is ok, slightly above average with big portion, however the cold brew we ordered is below our expectation as it came with half glass of ice cubes, which diluted the coffee and purpose of cold brewing, not sure if it is American style of cold brew tho, but it was definitely not what we signed up for.btw, whoever going with big group please be aware that seating only available with ALL parties arrive even there are empty tables available and reservation. the restaurant is tiny, with chair back to back with each others. The most unpleasant thing is the wait stuff putting up a long face after I told her my friends are reaching and told me that we were late for our booking, and wanted me to wait OUTSIDE the restaurant.

One of the best brunches I've had! Had the chicken and waffles â€” the waffles were soft and fluffy and the maple syrup was easily of one if the tastiest I had. Went at 2pm and still had a 30min waiting time for walk-ins. I guess this shows how popular the place is.
3
We came to Clinton Street Baking Company for brunch. I had the French toast, was nice but needed a crunch element as everything was too soft. A weird comment I know, but I felt like this place would be good for a old person with bad teeth. The coffee was not that good but the fresh oj was very lovely.
4
It was the first time I tried fried chicken with waffles and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the usual crispy waffle but it was more of a soft waffle that went quite well with the fried chicken pieces. The whole dish wasn't overwhelming or greasy and I liked it. Nice place to get away from the Friday crowds.
5
Great service. Had their chicken waffle, waffle and chicken was done nicely but something seems to be missing from the plate. Maybe Having some scramble eggs would be nice!
4
Coffee is expertly made -- and it was wonderful to have a flat white again -- however, we thought the prices a tad high ($6 for a regular size coffee). The cheese scones were served warm with butter and were amazing!
4
Food was good thought it is at the pricey end. Portion is quite huge for one, would be nicer if there are smaller portions.
3
Was there previously and liked it. This visit was just average, though. Should've just stuck to the pancakes.
5
Food were awesome. The maple butter and blueberry pancakes are to die for. 10/10 will come back! Thanks! (:
4
Definitely need to reserve if you are coming here for breakfast. The pancakes are really popular. Had the fried chicken from the afternoon menu and it was juicy and tender. The portion is big so I think two small eaters can share a plate.
3
The pancakes are the star of the show. Light and fluffy and very tasty. The buttery ma[ple syrup is wonderful. My girlfriend had the breakfast biscuit with eggs, cheese and bacon. The biscuit itself was a 10. The rest of it was rather bland. Needed some seasoning and some herbs. Just kind of flat. Our friend had the Spanish skillet with chorizo, which he said had very little flavor. The hash browns had very little crisp and looked like white potatoes with nothing on them. Food came out 5 minutes apart so that we could not all eat together. Very awkward. Coffee was blah. The baked goods are excellent and they clearly put no effort into anything else. This place lives on a famous name from NYC. There are much better options in Singapore and we won't be back
5
I have heard from so many people how good this place is and you have to book a table if you want to enjoy the delightful food they serve with a great attitude. I went with my mom and brother 2 months ago and let's just say it was a fun and tasty experience. I have been there twice a week every since. I would personally recommend the chicken and waffles (11:30am onwards), veggie sandwich (I hate veggies but this is amazing), root beer float and the sweet potato fries. The food their is made with so much love and it tastes delicious. I am not kidding when I say delicious, it is fresh and just the perfect amount of seasoning. Don't even get me started on the texture. You guys have to try it out!!!

Went to Clinton with some friends for brunch. Though we made a reservation, they only allowed us to be seated when all of us arrived. Food was alright, pretty mediocre though. I think I can get something better out there with the same price. Interior of the place was bright and cheery, a tad noisy to have a conducive conversation.
3
Stepped in and the first thing that strike me is "hashbrown" smell. Ordered the fries, chicken and waffle and Clinton Street Omelette. Fries quite yummy although I wish they are hotter (like fresh off the fryer). The chicken breast in the chicken and waffle is Yummy and soft, but the waffle is not fragrant and chewy enough (I like those served with ice-cream). The hashbrown in the Clinton Street Omelette is a bit too oily and crispy, the sourdough bread is a bit too hard, the only savior is the omelette! The lighting could be a bit more dim to have a bit of mood. Overall average food and don't consider coming back
5
Avoid the peak hours if you prefer a quieter sit-down. Otherwise, the small outlet can sit quite alot of people. Service generally was very sincere and food was quick to arrive. Quality of food is wonderful.
5
The food here is fantastic. It was rare that the mains we ordered were all good. We had blueberry pancakes, an omelette and french toast. Portions were hearty too.
4
Remember to book via chope . Pancakes fluffy and maple syrup is nice.
Salmon egg scrumble very tasty
5
Came here with a friend to try the cakes and there were too many to choose from. The chocolate banana pie was awesome and so was the blueberry cake~ really good coffee as well! Perfect for afternoon tea
4
We are always happy eating here. Our favorites are the pancakes, huevos rancheros, farmer's breakfast and the biscuits with its accompanying jam. Service is good and we've always found parking easy on the same street.
3
Came on a Friday afternoon for lunch with colleagues, and the place was already quite packed when we arrived. Nice place, atmospheric decor, though it got noisy and loud very quickly as the place filled up.Food took slightly longer than average to be served, and among my colleagues and I, there are mixed reviews about the food. The waffles were too soft and soggy though the chicken was good. The pasta was apparently goo too,, but my 3-egg omelette was downright disappointing.The omelette was too dry, and frankly, with 3 eggs put into this omelette, I think it pretty much drowned out the taste of the cheese, which I tasted only at the beginning of the omelette.I may or may not come back here. It's pretty expensive, and with the kind of omelette I got, I can't quite get over it and therefore can't decide if it's worth giving them another shot
4
On weekends the place is often packed and the queue spills out to the street but on a weekday, there is probably no need for reservation at all. A side dish of french fry and hash browns costs $7 each. A Mexican style fried egg with chorizo is $25 and a chocolate pancake is $21. Thank god the water is free, unlike most of the local diners. The taste is definitely above average. Once a while treat
3
We went there for breakfast and had a pancake with fruits and a Capuccino. The service was good and fast and the food came really quick. The price is very high for that what you get, but I think the problem is more the price level generally in Singapore than it is an issue from this bakery. It's a good place to go for a solid breakfast
4
I went just recently, and thought the food was excellent. The fried chicken was moist and waffles were sufficiently well-done.Unfortunately, the service was not great. The staff didn't care to answer my queries about the food, and more than once, I encountered slamming of plates on my table
3
This was my return visit after a good experience on a friday night but unfortunately this time, the stars didnt align. I tried their pancakes and apple pie which was nice and inspired this 2nd visit. I came for brunch on New Year's day at 3:00pm and the place was packed. I ordered a plain waffle (which on hindsight is not value since the waffle + ice cream = $18 and the waffles with fried chicken was $21), plus a kale salad. The kale salad came first and it was a big plate for the small-ish table, so we asked a staff if we can hold the waffle due to space constraints. We were taken aback when he frowned, looked annoyed with us, and asked us in a irritated manner if we had informed the staff when we placed our order (not with him obviously). We said we didn't but we decied to let it go since he really looked very annoyed. The waffle came soon after - while the waffle itself was nice, the scoop of vanilla ice cream was really bad: tasted like it was a poor quality store-bought flavor.I'm not sure about a return visit due to the flactuating experience but its near my work place so lets see next time.
4
I had pancakes for the past few visits and finally tried the chicken waffles. It didn't disappoint me although the fried chicken fillets were slightly salty.
5
Pancakes were excellent as usual - fluffy and soft, pillowy. Maple syrup went really well. Great brunch.
5
During our visit, every table had their signature blueberry pancake. Needless to say, their pancake was a must try. I would say it is one of the best in Singapore.
We tried their buttermilk sandwich also. One word to describe it all: excellent.
5
Food is very good, we enjoyed it. Do order their fluffy pancakes, I highly recommend it!
Service is also very fast and prompt.
5
Portions big. Service good. Waitress has a cool sense of humour

Had a lunch by myself there. The service was reasonably prompt. The food is nice and comforting, nothing extremely outstanding but definitely above average.
5
greta selection of food. however, the lobster mac and cheese and truffled eggs were already sold out by the time we went in. hopefully we'll be able to try that next time. chicken and waffles, and huevos rancheros get an A+ from my group of friends but salmon rosti was disappointing. the rosti potato pancakes were smaller than expected and didn't seem worth the hefty price tag. but other than that, great dining experience
1
My table of 4 were done with food but not done with coffee and we were given the bill without us asking for it because there is a group of 4 waiting outside for a table. Told the waiter that it felt as though we are being chased out. He said if you want, you can move to the counter. Ridiculous! The whole restaurant didn't only have us there so why the need to chase us out! There was no clause which states, leave immediately after finishing your meal nor you are only allowed 1hr in the restaurant.Totally spoilt my day
2
Had the pleasure of dining at Clinton in the states and expected the same standard in SG. The French toast was too sweet and soggy. The salted caramel shake is a delight for those who like it sweet - not much salt in it. The atmosphere itself is too rowdy that it seems like a sports bar on a Super Bowl weekend.

My wife and I were very happy to stumble across Clinton Street Baking Company while in Singapore. The restaurant is on Purvis Street, across the street from the famous Hainanese chicken spot, Chin Chin Eating House.My wife and I ordered the blueberry pancakes and they were true to the recipe both in the Clinton Street Baking Company cookbook (a must-buy!) and the original Clinton Street, NYC establishment. The only area where they fell short was their coffee (the house brew). I was expecting it to exactly match North American style and Tate, but it was more muddy with a strange taste and no cream! I was not entirely sure why they could not possibly get coffee right when they were so true to form on the food options
5
Great American style breakfast, top quality pancakes, freshly squeezed OJ, and real coffee. The service and decor were perfect too.
1
Arrived,got spot at bar, seating here for 10 minutes, nobody asking me for drink or food order. They are so busy serving tables. I done with this place.
4
Pricey but everything in Singapore city is a little on the dear side. All day breakfast is not that common in Singapore but Clinton St is one that does. Good location in centre of business district and near to Raffles Hotel. Food is tasty and a bustling decor. Only downside is they don't have wifi - big no no in today's cafe world
3
This hot little gem from NYC came to Singapore approx. a year ago. Not sure about original taste but this branch at Bugis is just average. Not too authentic in the taste though the material looks ok. Maybe you still could try its flagship pancake but the breakfast is so-so comparing against others around Arab st, Haji & Bugis
3
After having tried their signature pancakes, buttermilk chicken & waffles on a couple of occasions, my friend and I decided to explore other dishes on the menu. Unfortunately, while the scrambled eggs are a delight, the soggy toast and the rosti were disappointing. Would probably stick with pancakes next time. The acoustic in the restaurant was quite bad and it was hard to hear each other while chatting, would suggest that the management look into sound-proofing the walls..
3
The food served is good in taste and quality, however the pricing and portions is way off on some items.They had a specials menu where we ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese - charged at SGD 19.00 - the portion was tiny and only had 4 chunks of lobster!? We complained to staff about this and their response was "Oh it's actually meant as a side dish" - ok fine but how the hell can you then charge so much for a side dish when your mains are SGD 22 to 25?I had the farmers plate which came with 2 tiny medallions of meat. Again charged at SGD 22.00 they should at least make it 3 pieces.Freshly squeezed orange juice at SGD 6.50 served in a small cup not even holds 250ml.The only item we ordered that was worth the price tag and portion were the Blueberry pancakes and Spanish breakfast.It's not about the price / cost it's more about matching what you are serving with what you are charging for it. Especially since its an American brand definitely NOT American portions.I'm sure Singapore has better value and quality places to brunch - I'd only go back once I hear this has been rectified, ridiculous example of restaurateurs taking advantage of over charging just because they are representing an imported brand. I've been to the original Clinton St Bakery in the US and the portions are much more reasonable
4
Had breakfast here. Walked from our hotel Marina Mandarin, it took about 15 minutes. Nice inside with good selection on the menu. I had the Clinton Street Omelette with bacon, it was a good size 3 eggs I think. We had a farmers plate eggs bacon sausage and hash brown. And chocolate chunk pancake. An ice tea, and orange juice and a strawberry lemonade. We had good service and including tax the bill was $95. Singapore $It was a bit expensive but we just wanted a more western breakfast for a change and would go again
3
I recently ate breakfast here and was happy with the food but wasn't wowed. I didn't order the waffles/pancakes as I don't like sweet breakfasts but maybe I should have according to other reviews! I did like the coffee though, very good.Service was fast and friendly
3
So this is an American place so there were a lot of Americans who came here. Service just seemed a little slow even though the place was not completely full. Usual American food - food was okay but they did have nice milk shakes. The sausages are made by them so they are preservative free. Good thing is that it is open by 8am on weekends so suitable for an early breakfast
3
Food was nice and the portion was big. Good for sharing. 5-8min walk from Bugis Junction. The only thing I don't like is that there wasn't much varieties in the breakfast, for example the country breakfast. It comes with 1 ham, 1 hashbrown, eggs. The portion was very big but there is no other combination like mushroom, tomatoes, greens, etc
4
Ordered pancake with banana and walnut, plus extra blueberry. It came in generous serving with great maple butter mix. Good for 2 pax sharing!
5
Loved the New York feel to the cafe. We ordered the signature buttermilk biscuit and pancake and both were awesome. Problem was the queue as they only take reservations for dinner. But worth waiting in the queue for a satisfying brunch!
5
One of the best all around restaurants we have been to in a while for good old fashioned US style cooking. The Chicken n' Waffles are definitely not to be missed and the pancakes came highly recommended and were indeed very good, but I have never understood paying for something that is so easy to make really, but definitely worth it if you are a pancake lover! Chicken n' Waffles
2
we arrive just at noon and we got a table quickly. Managed to ordered in time as well. However, everything went down hill from there. Food took over 30mins to arrive and not at the same time. We had the chicken on waffle that arrived first. we then waited another 20mins for the chicken with corn bread to arrive. The chicken arrived looking over-fried, dark fried skin was flaking off. when we go to cut into the chicken, it was red and bloody. After sharing feedback to the manager, he didn't even bother to come apologise himself, but sent his wait staff (not her fault). we then waited another 15mins for new chicken, at least the new pieces of chicken was properly cooked. Very disappointed considering this is not the first time we have been here and we usually like the place
4
The best pancakes I have found in Singapore and their fried chicken is incredible! Admittedly sometimes they are inconsistent in food quality (seems to be when they are super busy) but when they get it right - food is great. Service seems to always be a little on the slow side - but not enough to deter the overall experience. Portions are huge
3
Was looking forward to a great breakkie but was disappointed. The food does t have a lot of taste and the coffee is mediocre. Maybe the pancakes are better but stay away from the eggs. The portion sizes are off the charts also, so maybe sharing is the right move.
5
We were here for brunch on a weekday, so there wasn't any line. We were seated immediately. Cosy ambience and good service. We ordered chicken & waffle (love the chicken & the sweet sauce), sugar bacon burger (Patty was well cooked, although fries was a little too oily & overcooked), cappuccino (so-so), and house brew (smooth & fragrant). We were totally satisfied with the taste and presentation. Overall, we'd definitely come back to try other items.
5
These are the exact words uttered by our teenaged daughter. If you are looking for a change when eating in Singapore you might like to try this wonderful place. Good burgers, twice cooked fries and Western deserts. Great coffee too. Not cheap but what do you expect for a "to die for" salted chocolate shake-those are the words of our son.Happy family dining
5
We love going to Clinton Street Baking Company. The staff are terrific and in spite of the long wait (no reservations) at times, we have enjoyed the food and experience. Among our favourite items are the huevos rancheros and the eggs benedict. The coffee is great and the service is reasonable. People we have taken there love it.
4
That's just it: best pancakes in town and very kind service. They let you take your time (a luxury compared to other places that we are now boycotting... ). Not giving it 5* because I would still like to be able to book in advance (which seems to be against their "religion"). The scrambled eggs, the coffees: all good. My new favorite breakfast place in town
4
Came here for brunch on a weekday. Didn't have to wait to get a table. However, all tables are placed so close together. Its basically dining with the table next to you. Portions are big.
3
It took them 30+ minutes to make my eggs Benedict. I felt the quality of the food was average/sub par, but the portions were large. My girlfriend an omelette with bacon and mushrooms but it wasn't great either.
4
Had Saturday brunch there and was impressed from the get go. No bookings so you take your chances (but 11:30 am or there about seems a good time) but the staff kept contact and updating on progress see we didn't feel abandoned. Once inside we were seated in a bustling hive of activity and conversation. menu was good with lots of variety and the coffee and water arrived quickly, with a full cup, which was appreciated.We had a selection of eggs, poached and scrambled together with the obligatory pancakes. Whilst thick they were light and fluffy and went down a treat.Staff were quick to respond and nothing seemed too much trouble in terms of variations to the menu. The food arrived promptly and all meals were hot a very tasty.From a cost perspective significantly better than the place we were stung at recently in Orchard Road so this one gets my vote. Oh yes and no time clock
3
The pancake is quite creamy n buttery but was quite disappointed with their fried chicken.It is kind of bland but it is tender & soft.It's more for gathering than eating for lunch or dinner as their portion is quite big so it is good for sharing
4
Our third visit in six months was the best visit yet. The restaurant is improving over time. The pancakes are fluffy, the sausage was delicious, the sweet potato fries flavorful, and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The only negative is that the tables are tiny and the space is cramped
2
Walked past the restaurant and it was crowded so we decided to stop for brunch. The interior was cozy and staffs were attentive. However the Omelet I ordered was average, bacon wrapped in the egg was soggy and mushroom was tasteless. The hash brown that came with the plate was soggy and bitter, I could not convince myself to finish it even though I am against wasting food. The only thing that was ok in my meal was probably their bread.
3
We went around 9am on Saturday and we managed to get a table for 3. Lucky us. It was packed afterwards. We had pancakes, brioche French toast and a farmhouse breakfast. Very large servings of food but our orange juice was only half a glass. The waiter confirmed, that's their normal serving! It cost $6!But overall food was good. Quite an expensive breakfast for 3 including drinks, almost $100
4
My friend brought me here for dessert, they have delicious pies. The prices are on the higher end, but the food is delicious. It can get crowded during peak hours, so it's best to reserve seats in advance. Although it may take a while during peak hours, the staff are friendly and service is good. Overall, good food, nice atmosphere in a central location. Will come back again

Clinton Street Baking Company's food is American style comfort food, like what you would get in a diner Stateside. The food comes in generous portions & you won't leave hungry. Enough people have posted here on the blueberry pancakes & chicken with waffles as well as their cakes & baked goods so I won't comment on that. Clearly the restaurant has a problem with handling crowds. I was there right after opening time at 8 am till just after 9. Even that early on a Sunday, the family groups kept coming. The two servers gamely struggled to cope while the manager was kept busy just making coffee. Even though I got there early, the kitchen did not come out with the orders till at least a good half hour later by which time the restaurant was full with several parties waiting. Better to get someone to make the coffee & have the manager manage the restaurant, seating guests & getting food served timely. I saw tables who were half done with the food but their coffee orders weren't served yet. Paying was also hampered by the fact that there were only 3 staff (a third person only arrived as I was leaving).For these reasons I'd say give this restaurant a miss during busy periods. It was stressful to see the staff struggle & I didn't enjoy my meal. My main thought was to get out so some of those families could get a table!
4
I first had this back in NYC but it really didn't blow me away. Perhaps they were having a bad day. But it explains why I've been reluctant to visit, particularly in view of the long queues supposedly. I finally made it here last night and I'm kind of sorry I took so long. Opening hours have been extended to 10pm which was perfect as we were looking for a place for desserts after dinner. We had the blueberry pancakes, chocolate and banana cream pie and salted caramel milkshake. The pie ($8) was unexpectedly delicious, a balanced combination of chocolate and banana flavours, and I am definitely going to return for more. It was so good we didn't have time to take a picture because we were busy gobbling it down. The pancakes ($18) were fluffy though I think they can be more generous with the blueberries. I thought it was slightly better than the NY outlet but my friend thinks otherwise. The milkshake ($10) was delightfully thick and creamy without being overly sweet. Unfortunately, they ran out of rum so we couldn't try the "boozy" version. I really liked that it wasn't crowded at night and am looking forward to my next visit
