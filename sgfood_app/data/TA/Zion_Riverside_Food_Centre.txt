Brilliant cheap hawker food. Had the char kway teow and it was great. Lots of locals lining up for that one!

Was there a few times. Food is very cheap but very tasty. A place, where local Chinese seem to go. Very casual and high variety of local dishes.

Nice char kway teow place, always a long queue (for a good reason) and an excellent juice stall next to it!
5
Delicious big prawn noodles and char kway teow.
Both stalls usually have long queues, so do expect to wait for yummy food

The Chicken rice is delicious!! Check it out travellors!! Ask for chicken feets or extra eggs! Chilipaste u can take more!

The Zion Riverside Food Centre is located just across the road from Great World city shopping mall. Handy location with a nice setting by the river. It is not a large hawker but has plenty of stall variety. Many of the stalls here seem to be very popular based on the queues. We went to the dumpling stall in the corner. The Xiao Long Bao and Leek/Pork steamed dumplings were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend this stall

Best way for visitors to Singapore keen to visit an authentic hawker centre since this one is just three to four bus stops away from places like Wheelock Place mall, Ion mall, Four Seasons hotel etc. More famous stalls dishing out local fare include "Char Kway Teow", which is fried rice noodles with black soya sauce, eggs, cockles (optional). A little oily for some if you are used to eating just salads, grilled stuff or pasta. Another one worthy of trying is the prawn noodle stall. With freshwater prawns and a lovely thick prawn & pork soup broth, this takes the cake for trying something that is much less likely to be found elsewhere globally (except possibly for Malaysia). Try the $12 bowl serving as it comes with larger prawns that present a sizeable delectable bite. If opting for the biggest possible prawn catch, see if the $25 option is available for the day. For desserts, an interesting option for consideration would be from the soya bean stall that serves "ah balling" soup. A soya bean based dessert that comes with small circular balls made of glutinous rice flour with a peanut centred filling. Serves as a warm dessert. Lovely sweet taste that once again, presents a unique taste buds experience for someone game to try out new stuff while in Singapore

Delicious food from spacialized food stands. Duck soup, sugar cane juice, all sorts of fruit juices made fresh. Various choices of many kinds of meal available here and all are delicious. 95% of people here are locals so for sure you won't see a lot of tourists. Very nice spot for eating and still not full of tourists. Njoy! ;

Uncle was terribly rude and bad service mind. Satay is 70c/piece and it sucks because it taste like overnight piece of rubbery gum that appear to be reheated by microwave oven. Nothing to rave about their chicken wings, CMI.They aren't worth even worth a single star

No pork no lard - would it taste as good? They also have an A in cleanliness - would it ve authentic? When I went there, there were no queues, or so I thought. What u didn't realise is that they worked out a very good system whereby the order is taken, and the patrons get to sit down and wait.So I waited, determined to have the carrot cake with eggs and the carrot cake with black sweet sauce.And I wasn't disappointed! For just $5, you get the black and white, which is the best of both worlds.While waiting, I was typing this review and taking photos of her stall. This is the must try original stall 26 at ZiÃ¶n Road food centre.Verdict: Different from what I expected, but pretty nice all the same. Think I like the black sweet sauce version
4
Just follow the queues and you can't go wrong. Favourites include the braised duck, prawn noodles and char kway teoh. So yummy! Lines move quickly so waiting is minimal

I have been going to the malay nasi lemak store they have very good food and the price is very reasonable.

Good n tasty but prawns were flat...at $8bucks not really value for money ...The best part was the pork ribs ...the soup was tasty n the sauce on the dry bee hoon sweet..still prefer River South Prawn noodle though ...
3
Well it is a nice one but it is another Hawkers food market like the others and the food is similar except the location is rather nice and you can sit and relax by the river and you do not have to go to quayside to spend large sums of money on foo

I have seen its evolution since it's built in the 70s. Today, besides store 18 fried kway teow, it houses one of the best prawn noodles in Singapore. For good size ocean prawns, you need to order the $16-$20 version; otherwise there is little difference from other stores, except the soup. Fried carrots cake fish ball noodles and the morning buk kut tea (pork rib soup) are must try. The chongbang bbq store open only in the evening.

We went to the Zion Riverside food centre as we heard they had great Char Kway Teow and they were right. We went to number 18 and there was a line of about 10 people but it lived pretty quickly. It was definitely worth the wait as the food was well balanced with deep flavours and crispy bits of pork. We also tried number 24 And got the braised duck rice which was great. The duck was succulent and served with a garlic soy rice and pickled tasty greens. One of the better food centres in Singapore and how can you go past paying $4 each for these amazing dishes

Good for simple, and economical meals whether u are alone or in a group. Try Ah Xiao traditional teochew braised duck. Duck is tender and tasty and comes with complimentary boiled soups (usually radish or watercress). The zhu zha tang, ban mian and western food stalls (3 located side by side) are good too

After arriving at our hotel, the Holiday Inn Atrium, we decided we would wander around a little and find our dinner. What a fortuitous decision this was. We found the Zion Riverside Food Centre and there we purchased a delicious meal for two for the grand total of $13.50 Singapore dollars.The food was excellent and the service quick and pleasant. Although we had some language differences the trader was friendly, helpful and accommodating. The centre has numerous family run food outlets all of them equally friendly and helpful.Highly recommended

Savour cheap local eats like fried carrot cake, chicken rice, kway chap and cheng tng by the riverside at this airy, neat hawker centre. Not far from the Holiday Inn and several boutique/budget hotels.You can walk to the charming Tiong Bahru estate, as well as the Robertson and Clarke Quays from here. Or visit the nearby shopping mall Great World City.This food centre is accessible by public bus

We were in Singapore for a week and had lunch here most days. Meals for about 5 Singapore dollars. Beautiful food and could eat in the cool of the fans undercover from the hot noon day sun. Range of local food such as noodles, rice, dumplings, fish chicken and pork. Something different every day
5
Brought friends from overseas to try local food. Char Kway Teow, Fish soup, braised pig trotter, fried carrot cake (black/white), duck rice.
4
The carrot cake with black sweet sauce is amazing. The gentleman who operates the stall is a cooking machine. Prices very reasonable and an easy walk from Scotts/Orchard Road intersection if you don't mind getting sweating.

Nice food centre beside the canal , with a lot of local street food available, visited several time, love the kueh chap, prawn noodles, ngoh Hian and Chay kueh Teow. Good place to find do many food.

We dropped in for lunch before buying some $25 shirts at the M&S store in Great World City. The Centre is a kind of collective where there are dozens of competing stalls each doing their own thing. I picked the duck specialist, store 24 and went for the most expensive item on the menu - Braised Duck Set Meal for 2, plus 2 portions of rice - grand total of $10.00 and it was very good, accompanied by cucumber, coriander and separate chilli sauce. Good quality breast meat with no bones at all. The place was full of locals who clearly came every day - I think we were the only tourists in the restaurant most of the time we were there. The meals we enjoyed were actually cheaper than the large bottle of Tiger beer I bought from the adjoining stall which was $6.80 for 500ml and came with a glass chilled in the fridge. If you seek out the street vendors, Singapore is by no means an expensive city for good food

We went for lunch twice to this food center on Zion Rd. It is one of the few local good food places! Singapore has become so modern that the true cultural food is hard to find!! The Kway Teow from the Charismatic chef was amazing!!! Worth your time to go to if you are in Singapore!!
4
I was recommend to eat at the Zion Riverside Food Centre by the company I was visiting on business and I was not disappointed. Good variety of local tasty food at very reasonable prices. Full of locals which is always a good sign. Mixed fruit juices smoothies were great. Defiantly worth a visit if you are in the area.

A simple place with lots of food choices at a very affordable prices. It is great if you are on a low budget or if you love street food. This place can be packed with locals. The food prepared here is great. If you don't know what to choose, right at the entrance, there is a list of the top 10 'must try' dishes. We stopped for a quick bite on a Saturday, for lunch and luckily the place was empty

Located across the street from Great World City Mall and right next to the Singapore River/walkway, lots of food kiosks/stalls here that comes at a low price. There's many stalls here consisting of Chinese/Malay style food, I think there were afew Indian stalls as well. Fresh coconuts/beer/fruit juice can be bought as well. It's an open seating area with plenty of room usually, although it can get packed during peak times. Most of the seating is covered, so rain isn't a problem. Best to bring smaller bills, also it looked like everything was cash-only. Service was good, spoken languages were Mandarin, English and some Melayu. It's not as crazy as the Chinatown People's Park food center is, so smaller crowds. You can walk in the mall across the street, stroll the river, etc. then come by for some cheap eats

Great hawker with a nice layout. Convenient location overlooking the river and close to Great World. Affordable drinks and food. Well maintained and clean.Only tried it a few times but would be returning here for sure. The kway teow was particularly good, though that wasn't a surprise given there was a queue of people waiting to order. Ended up waiting for 15 minutes in the line - totally worth it

This Hawker centre was close to our accommodation otherwise we would not have stumbled on it. Wet Monday night that we were there, so not all stalls operating.Very clean, good range of "local" food at "local" prices - and 90% of the patrons are local.Most enjoyable and would recommend if you are in the area (on the river,near Great World City)
