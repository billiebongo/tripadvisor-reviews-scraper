It was difficult to find but it worth of it. Scrambled eggs are one of the best I have ever tasted. Friendly atmosphere.

Such good coffee! Ronin isn't well signed, so aim for 17 Hong Kong Street and the cafe is on street level. As to the interior, it feels like walking in to a Melbourne cafe. Good, simple food as well.

I went here for a brunch with my bestfriend. First of all, it's a nice cafe. Really tho. The service was excellent :) run by youngsters, I guess. Can be easily seen from the barista, waiter, etc. They were all still quite young, but have a very great manner and service! 4 thumbs up! The waiter will explain to you if you have any question. oh, and in casual but still polite style :) a big PLUS point for this place!The Place: It's located in Hongkong Street, Clarke Quay area. SO yeah, a very convenience location :P But, it was a bit difficult to locate the Ronin Cafe. Because there was no clear sign. So, if you saw 7eleven, then the Cafe is just few steps ahead.The atmosphere: The dimmed light probably aimed for a calm & cozy atmosphere. But, I don't know, probably because it was brunch, so it was a bit noisy, due to many guests there. I can't tell for lunch or dinner. The music was good, tho. Not too loud. So yeah, it was because there was a lot of guests having brunch that made it a bit loud.But you can still talk easily with your companion.The interior: Modern style with wooden and rustic touch. CMIIW.. I just able to see as far as my eyes and camera can captured :D And I already told you about the dimmed light. Like really dimmed. So, if you wanna read, you need extra effort.The Foods: I wasn't expecting much, Because it's a resto-cafe. But, the foods were great! I Love it. And I just assuming, that their default meat (if not stated otherwise) is Pork. So, if you don't want to have pork, make sure you state it to the waiter. I forgot the name of the dishes I ordered, but I attached the photo along with this review. Both are good! :)Oh, they don't have the regular ice tea, so they will serve you the iced earl grey. Tbh, I never tried iced earl Grey, I usually have it in hot. But, it was surprisingly good. Very refreshing :DThe Portion: Quite big. Literally. Especially for two little girls and for a brunch.. haha.. SO, if you are a big eater, You'll love it. But if you're a light eater, probably best to share.The Price: Well, reality hits! Haha.. It's a bit expensive tho. For me. But, It was okay. I mean the price kinda equals with the foods' quality.I would love to reccommend this place to everybody :

We ordered the savoury French toast and Egg with toast. I must say I enjoyed the Savoury French toast a lot. It was so good I would definitely come back for it. Have not really tasted one that is this good! The egg and toast on the other hand was good as well. Eggs were fluffy and nicely done. Service was good as well with friendly staff. Too bad I don’t have pictures as we tucked in right after the food was served

Secluded ! Not easy to locate along HongKong Street. The cafes crowded on a weekend and car park wasn’t quite an issue. This might be different on a weekday when the hustle and bustle sets in . Best to then park at Central across the road. Didn’t try the food but must say their coffee , hot chocolate and iced wicked is pretty good. Perhaps the cafe could offer some cakes or pastries for tea . The staff is friendly and service is pretty good. Will return to try their food the next round

Ronin has cool decor and simple straight forward menu. Service is all over the place with staff running around but not really efficient. I had poached eggs on toast with portobello mushroom, spinach, sausage, avocado and the iced matcha - tone. It was all fine but not anything I couldn't make myself. Lots of food for a small plate. My husband had the Bircher museli which he liked and an OJ. We didn't bother to stay for coffee. Worse thing is there's no where on the menus that say the place is cash only nor were we told by anyone! So my husband had to leave me there and go out in search of an ATM. As a tourist that is very inconvenient and annoying.
4
I came back here for another visit last week after having had lunch in the vicinity. It's a great little cafe, albeit a little tricky to find (there being no signs). But the atmosphere inside is great and the coffee very decent. Worth a visit for sure

10.30am is the time i usually begin waking up on Sundays.. Then it the smart phone to see if there are urgent messages. By 10.45am i'd have asked google where to head to for brunch..Although it wasnt the first on the list... i decided on it.. just because!Washed up dressed, grabbed my Darling and ushered her to the car... found this place without any problems... Hong Kong Street, two road after Clarke Quay.Hmmmmm... interesting this Hole-in-wall cafe... plain, simple a little dim, cosy and busy. (I have no idea why since its out of the way with no foot traffic, i found out later though)Darling ordered scrambled eggs, toast and pork sausage and i had scramble eggs, toast and bacon.The fiid came, dam it was good.I didnt see a full kitchen... am still wondering how they made that light fluffy scrambe eggs ( tough to do). The pork sausage was good as were the bacon (bacon is always good :p)The lattes were good too as one would expect of cafes these days, so wasnt disappointed.Service crew were engaging and smiling.. they came across more as host of a party as oppose to being just a staff.Overall experience 8/10. Would I come back... hell yeh
5
If you like your coffee in Australia, this is the place go. High quality expresso coffee and great toasted sandwiches and breakfasts. The café does not display any signage, (it doesn't need to), so you need to have the address. It has a dark industrial style interior, where customers undertaken business meetings in a one to one intimate way. Staff are friendly and after 1 day they know your daily needs. This is the café for those that appreciate great coffee
5
I went to Ronin's in the afternoon for some coffee and was blown away. We tried the Wicked, which is a mint mocha and the Generra, which is an orange mocha and loved both. The flavour of the coffee was delicious. It was a bit lukewarm though, so let them know if you want it hot. The staff is very friendly! We also got a grilled cheese sandwich- very cheesy and yummy. Definitely recommend
5
Discreet ! No sign board ! Full house of early break fast people !! Soft lights ... good music ! Excellent breads and damn good coffee
5
Minted Mocha and a Flat White..both made to perfection very smooth and easy to drink!
Nice ambiance bit when crowded can be a bit noisy to have a conversation..any great place directly opposite Clarke Quay MRT station..
5
Perfect, western breakfast, friendly staff!
We had Toast with poached egg and avocado, fresh juice and gooood coffee
5
We have always struggled to find coffee that comes up to our exacting standards when we are away from New Plymouth, NZ - our home town. We googled "Great Coffee in Clarke Quay" when we arrived and Bingo! we struck pay dirt first time!! Great coffee (Double Shot Flat White) - the temperature, texture, mouth feel, taste, aroma, acidity and appearance were all spot on. We didn't go anywhere else for our caffeine fix in our three short days in Singapore. And the brekky was pretty good as well; Bircher Meusli for Marianne and Bacon & Scrambled Eggs for me. As I said to the cashier when we left the first morning, there are only two people in the world who make awesome scrambled eggs; I'm one of those people and whoever made them at Ronin was the other!!
4
We went to Ronin for breakfast as it was a short walk from our hotel. Some reviews mentioned it was hard to find but we found it easily. It's 3 doors to the right of 7-11. We had the pancakes, scrambled eggs on toast and the Dirty Ronin toasted sandwich. All very tasty and reasonably priced, around $10-15 a dish. Coffee was also good. Some reviews say this is the best place for breakfast. While it was tasty, I wouldn't say it's the best. Good but there are better. The restaurant is cash-only. It came to around S$50 for breakfast. I would go again.
5
Visiting from Sydney, we love good coffee and early starts, so it was a double pleasure when we found Ronin. Very contemporary atmosphere, with quite subdued lighting and well spaced tables. We enjoyed the scrambled eggs with a side of bacon and the cheese toasted sandwich (which was decadently rich and creamy - and delicious!).Coffee was barista made and enjoyable, though not sure why my long black was served in a glass??Overall, very good.
5
So again thanks to trip advisor this was our next port of call.Hidden away but well worth walking the street a couple of times to find (thanks to the help of a lady on her cigarette break)I ordered a fresh apple juice (yum) and my partner an affogato...i'd love to tell you how that was but he demolished it without an offering-by all accounts it was delish!My partner ordered the bircher muesli and loved it.I ordered the Grilled Cheese add Ham sandwich (brie, emmental & smoked chedder) and I tell you what it's right up there when it comes to a toasted sandwich....my hands did not want to move when my partner asked for a bite!Well done team, keep up the great work
5
Ronin is a hidden gem nestled in Chinatown / CBD area.It has a very low profile facade so you are likely to walk past it (I did it a few times). If you have difficulty, then just look out for a mini 7-Eleven which is a few doors away from Ronin.The coffee is good and you must try the light and fluffy scrambled eggs.Seating is limited especially for big groups
5
Had to mention the superb scrambled eggs, great bacon and coffee, and value for money of this place. It was so good we came back the next day! Be aware that they only take cash. Our bill came to $44.50 for two coffees (double shot flat whites) and two scrambled eggs with bacon (+ one with avocado).
3
for breakfast we couldn't find many choices and went with a toast with eggs. It was decent but made the mistake of ordering it with mushrooms which had a weird smell. Thankfully that was on the side and not mixed with the eggs. Had tall black coffee but it was the strongest black coffee i have tasted in a while. Would definitely opt out for a cappuccino or something else even if you are a regular black coffee drinker.
5
Love this place - my local. Staff great, coffee spot on and while I don't eat there often basic menu done very well
Tempted not to write a review as want to keep as our little secret - keep it up guys!!
5
Had a lovely cup of latte. Food was great, just the way it should be. Simple menu just done very well.
Ronin sandwich was excellent. I love jow the place has its own identity and unpretentious, great ambience.
5
It's the best. The best coffee. Awesome team of people running it. Great breakfast smack in the center of Boat Quay.
5
Have been here several times now and their latte is the best one in Clarke Quay. Moreover, the staff is so friendly. A good place to go.
5
We found this gem on TripAdvisor and it didn't disappoint. As others have said, there is no signage, just open the door and walk in. The staff were welcoming. We both had the recommended scrambled eggs and they were fantastic. Just be aware it is cash only. I had to do a run across the road to a shopping centre for an ATM. It seemed to be a popular coffee take away spot for locals
5
Had breakfast here and it was superb. The scrambled eggs were lovely and creamy. The coffee was every bit as good as back home.The atmosphere is dark wood, polished concrete floors and cool lighting.There are no signs out front so you need to just go inside. I stood outside looking like a lost tourist (which I was) for 5-10 minutes
5
Thank you TripAdvisor for alerting me me to this little gem that I found whilst researching our family holiday. My husband, myself and our 2 teenage sons stayed 8 nights at the Park Regis near Clarke Quay and were looking for a cafe that served the sort of breakfast we're used to - eggs, toast, muesli, cappuccino, etc. Ronin is perfect, as is its nearby sister cafe, Punch. Both are only a 5 minute walk from the Park Regis. Ronin's glass doorway is set back from buildings beside it and there's no signage so you need to look at the building numbers to work out where number 17 is. It's hipster modern, has lovely low-key ambiance, nice music, lovely friendly staff and great food. Whilst not a cheap breakfast, we were more than happy to eat there, alternating our mornings with Punch. The servings are generous, the cappuccinos and iced chocolates are really good, they do the best Bircher Muesli (with creamy natural yogurt and sliced red grapes, divine). Their menu is small but everything on it is delicious. A very popular cafe, if you can't get a table, try Punch. YOU CAN ONLY PAY BY CASH
5
We just stumbled upon this little gem. It is tucked away on Hong Kong Street with no signs. I was lucky to find it by going for a closer look. I was lucky I did as I got coffee fix and came back another 2 times.Try the Dirty Ronin. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had.Staff ars super friendly, prices are reasonable to expensive however you do get what you pay for.. absolute perfection.Will come back next time I am in Singapore
5
We found this restaurant as we were staying near the area and came back twice is so good! The coffee is delicious and their "wicked" is so tasty. Portions were generous and the service is great. Scrambled eggs and the French toast were ordered multiple times in our party. Highly recommend if you like a western breakfast! Cash only and no signage out front.
5
Made it twice to Ronin during our 6 day visit to Singapore. Two couples who all enjoyed the scrambled eggs and French toast. Both were outstanding. Coffees top notch doing the mocha mint iced coffee, flat white and my favorite black (double espresso with a shot of hot water.) Flavorful and strong. Friendly service add to the great meal. Straight forward menu off the chalkboard so easy to make a decision. Wooden tables and chairs in a relatively small space add to the atmosphere. Ronin is frequented by tourists and locals alike so it is a must do for those who enjoy breakfast. No large signage which adds to the experience but address clearly marked and easy to find close to Clarke Quay MRT. Cash only so be prepared.
5
We came to Ronin after finding it on trip advisor! We wanted a great cup of coffee and breakfast. We were not disappointed. Ronin boasted both. And the iced macha is a must try.
4
This hard to find cafe will reward your persistence with among the best coffee you will find in Singapore. Go for brunch and have some scrambled eggs. A busy and friendly vibe with regulars frequently floating in and out....
5
This is a modern trendy cafe which wouldn't feel out of place in Shoreditch, London.
Nice vibe about it with excellent scrambled and poached eggs and the latte than many I've had in London - very nice.
5
The ice chocolate was amazing! And the French toast? Can't complain, was absolutely delicious. The garlic butter was a great touch!
5
I love this place! Great coffee. Great ambience. A great team! It's a great place to meet up with friends and work colleagues!
4
The wicked coffee which is mint mocca is good. This cafe is very crowded and the seating capacity is very limited but the friendly staff will help u on the spot .
5
Couldn't decide on eggs on toast or grilled cheese sandwich, so went ahead to ordering both for sharing. Eggs were amazingly fluffy and grille cheese sandwich was awesome too (try to share the sandwich) Their latte and flat white were alright, love their ice wicked (mocha with mint)All prices were inclusive of gst and there's no service charge! Totally my fav brunch plac
5
This coffee shop is tucked away with no signage outside. I had eaten here regularly last year and the coffee and breakfasts were great. When I returned in May this year it was just as good. We met the owner Vincent and he is a person who knows good coffee and employs good baristas. It is certainly worth the visit if you appreciate your coffee
5
It's taken 8 years but I have finally found the best coffee in Singapore, hidden away close to Clarke Quay. Keep your wits about you and look for the door which looks like an entry to a closed establishment. It's not. Upon entry you may giggle at the familiar hipster decor with wine bar lighting but don't let it fool you. This place does great coffee and fantastic breakfast. The prices are also super reasonable for Singapore, have paid infinitely more in the past for very poor coffee. Very important to note - it is cash only so make sure you have some on you so you don't have to do the dash across to the mall to get money
4
Ronin is definitely a hidden gem. It is small and dark, yet the food is pretty good. I would especially recommend their scrambled eggs, which are probably the best I've tried in town. Their coffee is also decent. It is a nice place for a weekend brunch with friends.
5
I go to Ronin twice a day, 5 days a week since last year.. coffee is great, food is tasty and comes in large portions. Staff if very nice!!
4
Really cute little coffee shop hidden away near our hotel. Amazing, strong coffee and relaxed atmosphere. Didn't try the food but the menu looks great!
5
We went here for breakfast ,it was lovely ,good choice ,fantastic coffee ,doesn't come cheap though ,we had poached eggs on two large slices of seeded brown bread ,well presented ,eggs cooked to perfection ,and the best coffee
5
Hidden away bit hard to find glad we found beautiful food and coffee! Great little breakfast spot!!!
4
The Sweet French Toast is good. But the portion seems big for one person. Best enjoyed as a couple.
Friendly staff as well. No pretensions. Will visit again.
5
Well i kind of summarized my experience in the review title. i highly recommend trying their Scrambled eggs with Avocado along with a good cup of latte. enjoy your time
4
If you blink, you will miss the cafe. Although sitting on ground level, the only signs are people moving in and out with takeaway cups and a small lamp on the wall. The ambiance is like a underground pub, but the food and coffee says otherwise. Love the cheese sandwich, which was oozing with 3 types of melted cheese to really fill your tummy. Coffee wise, tried one of their signature, the orange flavored because don't like mint with my coffee, found it pleasant and surprisingly smooth. But since I prefer black coffee with a touch of milk, found the chocolate a bit rich for my palate. Still, worth a trip back to have their sandwich and perhaps a double to taste how their coffee actually is
1
Not the type of blend I had in mind.... Travelling across Asia and Australia - we have come across various coffee roasters and blends... we are true coffee connoisseurs.... therefore I feel this blend is not as nutty or chocolatey as expected, personally it taste very similar to the other commercial coffees around ie. coffee Illy... I understand this blend is from Melbourne Aus, however it seems to be a commercial blend... If you prefer more of a single origin/ Colombian blend it is best to go for a roaster... The staff are lovely... but the coffee is not for me... suppose it's all preference, but I found it acidic (the flavour was too over roasted for me
3
It was my first time to visit this hidden cafe. It took me a while to locate this cafe as it didn't have any signboard. It was crowded when I reached and average waiting time 15-30 minutes.The place was a bit dark even during day time. The worst part was the mobile signal was Super weak with occasionally no service. Plus they do not provide free wifi. Overall the food was ok ok and the flat white wasn't that special.Will not recommend and there are other better choices out ther
4
I remember the coffee as being good but food not so memorable. The thing is that there are a lot of good places for brunch and whilst Ronin is definitely above average, its not that memorable. I also find the place a little dark for breakfast resembling more like a drinking place esp in the day time.
4
Came here for a coffee after lunch yesterday. Took a little while but the cappuccino was really quite decent. A pretty little design in the milk froth too. Popular place and a little noisy but friendly and efficient service.
5
What a beautiful place to go for a coffee and food.
Staff were friendly best place we went to while in Singapore.
5
Eventually found this place as there is no outside signage of note.
Worth it though. Great scrambled eggs and coffee.
Much nicer than a homogeneous Starbucks
5
Ronin is a great place to sit down and hide out and have coffee in the CBD. They have a really neat breakfast menu, and the ambience of the place is good for quick meetings.
4
We used to love The plain cafe that closed down recently. Ronin has the same vibes, great coffee, nice wait staff and good sandwishes///we love it
5
We went to this place each day whilst our stay in Singapore and it is amazing! The coffee, the food and atmosphere is great! The service is so friendly and helpful especially Vincent and Jane! Definitely looking forward to coming back to Singapore for this place!
3
Ronin resembles a dark subterranean dungeon so it's a little disconcerting if you're looking to read or work on your laptop. They have an excellent male server on the morning I was there who was all smiles & was super efficient to boot. Coffee was good; I had a flat white & double espresso. My breakfast order of scrambled eggs on toast with sausage & avocado was generous so can't complain about the food. Menu is limited but this hasn't stopped a steady stream of customers from frequenting. I'd much prefer their sister establishment one street away called Punch.
1
Food was overpriced and average at best. Ordered the long black and it, too, was average. Pretty surprised at the small serving size of the long black. Not a good cafe to chill-out. It's crowded at most times and the way the interior is constructed some how exemplifies the noise. The cafe also insists on blasting music despite the already high noise levels. I'm in awe of groups who are able to hear one another above the noise. Very very dark. Don't expect to sit and read anything. Oh and one more note, the waiter/waitresses do not record your order. Therefore, at payment, you'll have to remember what you've eaten and reiterate it to them. Pretty disappointed
4
Found this cafe online during my recent stay and it still took some finding even though its just a few doors from our hotel. The interior is cool industrial with little to no signage outside - but definitely worth the quest. The brekkie was nice with generous serves - the absolute standout being the delicious minted mocha. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Will definitely return. Any chance of delivery of a tall iced minted mocha to Australia in the meantime?
5
Best western breakfast I've had in Singapore. The quality of the produce and ingredients is outstanding. The poached eggs are tasty and cooked perfectly. The bacon is cooked perfectly. Everything was great. My partner's salada sandwich was also excellent. We topped the meal off with affogato which was also superb. Perfect balance of ice cream, coffee, and chocolate chips for a crunch element.
3
It feels like a Melbourne hipster cafe. There are no signs outside (so it took me a while to find it) but it did have good tea and coffee.
5
love the French toast , crowd can be a bit pretentious at times but definitively worth going for brunch and even lunch. accommodating staff
5
I.LOVE.THIS.PLACE. It's pretty hard to find but just follow the numbers on the buildings and if something looks like an office, you'd find Ronin's glass door there. It really is nearly hidden and it has no signage! (do not give up if you can't find it, it is so worth it)I've had the Dirty Ronin and Poached eggs on toast. Dirty Ronin: THE BOMB. MUST HAVE. Eggs: Came on two types of toast, eggs made to perfection, ordered an extra portobello -which was so soft, never in my life! I had the Matcha-tone which was beautifully served & very jelly like BUT tastes like any matcha to me. I've read so many people complain about the service but mine was wonderful. The restaurant is rather small and can be packed during brunch. Amazing food, value for money! The lighting and ambience is beautiful!In order to really enjoy this place, you must be able to SHARE a table with random strangers. Don't come over if you can't and want some romantic privacy
5
Okay, this coffee shop is not the easiest to find, especially since I had to walk up and down the street a number of times before I actually found it â€“ there aren't any signs advertising it, and it isn't clearly visible (it's hidden away at the back of the entrance to a small building). However it is certainly worth the trek because not only do they make some seriously good coffee, pretty much most, if not every person, who has been here only heaps praise on the place. It is a little dark and dingy, but I had no problems reading in here, and while they don't have a huge number of tables, they do do takeaway and is a perfect spot to come and get some decent coffee
5
Food is great - best eggs in town and nice staff ;) the sandwiches are made with tasty bread which is excellent.Only problem is you need pants and a ver warm jacket not to freeze in their.. I now have my food take-away and eat it at work! Too bad... ;
3
Popped in here earlier today for a coffee on the recommendation of a friend. It's a great little place with friendly service and a good atmosphere. My coffee was decent in terms of taste but just wasn't quite warm enough (the milk perhaps hadn't been heated to the right level). That said I would still come back for another visit
4
Ronin is a what I would call a classic hipster cafe in Singapore. Very trendy crowd comes here for their morning meetings to chow down on their tasty sandwiches and more than adequate coffee.Only downside is that there is basically no natural light so it makes you feel a bit like you're in a casino where time is standing still!Still, good place for a quick cuppa
4
We popped over to this place yesterday after our late lunch. We ordered ;- Skinny Flat White which was a little sour. A little high in Acidity. But overall aroma, body and aftertaste was nice. - Cortado was really sour.. Wow on the first sip I almost stop drinking it. But after another few sip I got adapted on those sour taste and able to finish it. This one really high in acidity, full body, clear on aroma and strong aftertaste. I'm personally preferred medium roasted coffee beans, low acidity but strong aftertaste. This place I would rate as 4* for coffee. Later I ordered two tone matcha latte. It was a bit weak on matcha aroma and taste more like milky. I had a lot stronger matcha aroma and taste from elsewhere. The service was very attractive and friendly. Specifically the girl in charge on cashier and the entrance doors. If I ever happened to be around this area. Definitely I will revisit this place. Good change for sour coffee which I normally not prefer.
5
When visiting Singapore we were delighted to find this fantastic little coffee shop. The coffee was great, and in the style that Australians are used to at home (ie flat whites, lattes that you would find in Melbourne or Freo). We ate breakfast on a couple of occasions and enjoyed everything.The service was friendly and helpful, and they were accomodating to parents having breakfast with young children
4
Went to Ronin for the first time during lunch break one day and loved it! To the point that I forgot about a conference call I was supposed to have and having to sprint back to office (at Raffles Place) in 3min after receiving a call from my colleague! But back to topic - i tried the french toast ($15 if I remember correctly) and flat white (~$5) and both were good! The place is also comfortable and chill - makes me wanna go back! And I will be back
5
fab service despite the lunch crowd
really good ice latte
tried the sandwich - really huge serving
will be back to try french toast and wicked mocha
5
We had a really good breakfast here.
Good eggs. Good Coffee. Good brownie.
Very good adress. Also good welcoming
4
Great place to have a breakfast in town. The scrambled eggs are to die for 😍 the homemade pastries are delicious. You can also enjoy good Genovese coffee. The place is quiet and has a lovely indoor design. Definitely a place to go.
3
I ordered black coffee. It was OK, nothing special. The place is quite dark. It is also difficult to find since the entrance is hidden between two apartment blocks. They don't accept credit card.
4
This place is on of the very few in singapore offering properly done eggs. Atmosphere and general feel of the place does it good as well. The only minus are slightly higher prices than you might expect.
5
If you like eggs, then definitely come here for the scrambled eggs (with or without avocado) - I would say they are one of the best I have ever tasted. And the bread is also delicious. Cool spot, average prices, eggs to die for ;)
5
Popped in here for coffee and a bite to eat. The service was extremely friendly, the food and coffee was 10/10 and the décor and ambience of the café was relaxing and pleasant. Very popular café so it can be difficult to get a seat. Full of locals and expats. Highly recommend, we will definitely return and will recommend to friends
5
This coffee shop was recommended to us by a friend in Melbourne. We have had breakfast and coffee there 3 times and the service, quality of coffee and food has been consistently very good.It seems well patronized by locals and visitors and we have already recommended it to others
5
You need to look carefully to find this little store, tucked away within the offices along Hong Kong Street, but persevere and you will not be disappointed.A bustling den of locals and travellers all consuming the delights on offer, the first of these being the service. The staff are attentive, eager to please and make you feel like a long lost friend, with one particular member of staff probably achieving the best waitress service I have ever been provided. She was wonderful.Now onto the food and drink. Any of the hot or cold coffees/chocolates are lush and for the food, anything on the menu is great, but of particular note are the egg dishes, poached, omelette or fried, absolute taste sensation.Do take the time to find this store out, you will not be disappointed
4
Oh Ronin, I'm sorry I met you so late. While I love your coffee and desserts, I'm really not a fan of the dim lighting and the noisy acoustics. It's kind of hard to have a decent discussion without getting a headache - I guess that's how you keep people from staying too long…We visited on a Saturday afternoon and got a seat pretty quickly. This is a sister cafe of The Plain I believe. Will be back for the coffee when I'm in the area.
5
Loved this new addition sweet French toast on the menu! Definitely have to go with Wicked Coffee. A place will not disappoint for both coffee and dessert lovers! Bravo!!
4
This hidden corner at Hong Kong Street. The scrambled eggs with toast was nice, egg was creamy... The signature "hot wicked" drink @ mocha. The staff was friendly.
3
Stopped by a few days ago along with my girlfriend for some coffee, after reading all the great reviews. I had an espresso and she had a "wicked". Coffee and Ambience are decent but nothing to write home about. Overall nothing special.
5
Excellent espresso, well pulled with care, and served by friendly staff. All in a nicely decorated, industrial look, shop.
Highly Recommended.
4
Love the service. Service crew were very attentive. Ronin's espresso coffee were very tasty. Granola was very nicely done. We ordered Funghi sandwich and it was really packed with a lot of mushrooms. Sweet French toast on the other side was a little too sour as there were too much blueberries sauce on it. Overall worth revisiting again.
4
Ronin is a well hidden art cafÃ© in Hong Kong street. They are well known among locals and this is the crowd you run into there as well. The coffee and espresso they offer tastes very good. The milk foam has a great texture. The location itself is quiet puristic without looking cheap. It has an art deco touch and the staff very friendly and helpful.I'll surely be back here
4
Ronin's so well concealed that despite working in a building really close by, we missed it for years! We finally landed there for Sunday brunch and boy, was it worth it!We had the Scrambled Eggs on Toast with Avocado and the French Toast (without Bacon) to eat, and also had an Iced Mocha and Cappuccino. The eggs were soft, creamy without being runny and just plain delicious. The French toast came with Poached apples, hazelnut butter, and syrup, and was really well made. The coffee was lovely too. We rounded off the meal with a Salted Caramel Brownie - one of the few times I could actually taste the salt in a salted caramel something - I was thrilled.The food's good, the prices are reasonable, and the folks are smiling and efficient. If you want good. unfussy brunch, Ronin's the place
1
The scrambled eggs are amazing. But unfortunately, it only goes down hill from there on...  The service is utterly shambolic; so much so, they don't know what you have ordered when you come to pay. You get a free coffee as a result of them not actually knowing. How this place makes money I do not know. 5 staff members to serve less than 30 customers.  Would you like to have your meal in 3 different stages? It takes 45mins to deliver 4 simple items (their menu is small).  Remember to bring your own condiments such as sauce as these are not provided.  The seating is uncomfortable but there is a nice ambiance. Avoid if you are in a rush or a group larger than 2 persons but if you like good scrambled eggs and can wait for 45mins, this is the place to go

We found out about this place via the net and we are so glad we did. What a wonderful place to have breakfast and a coffee, with its modern, industrial feel as well as the best we had during our stay. I traveled with my family with 2 kids and they just loved this place, that we ended up having breakfast their everyday other than on the weekend, as they were to busy to get us in. Note, that it is hard to find as the glass doors have no signage and are recessed back off the street Just look for the number 17 as well as it is next door to the City Backpackers. We were staying at the Swiss Merchant Court which is just over the road

Ronin Cafe is located in the middle of an unnoticeable street but the food they served will surprise you. Ordered their Dirty Ronin (VERY NICE Chorizo) and Scrambled Eggs on Toast and they are awesome!I was recommended to their Wicked Coffee but it kinda tasted like minty chocolate. Still nice though!It has a open concept kitchen so it gets little "smokey" when the chefs cooks.. this is a place you should try :

We were shopping at B.I.Y, got hungry and the cashier recommended Ronin. The place was hidden just around the corner, we wld've missed it if we didn't get any direction.It's a small place with an interesting set up and decor. My husband had a regular brunch meal, eggs with bacon and such - he loved the way they made the egg, perfect fluffiness he said. I ordered a french toast, it was pretty good until I found a piece of hair in my food. The lady behind the counter (she might hv been a manager/owner) asked if i would like a new one, since i refused, she didn't charge my meal. Coffee was ok, nothing too special

Its was through recommendations firend brought me there. Great place to hangup for a cuppa and some nice fingerfoods. Love this place, love the ambiance and good service. Overall enjoyed ourselves and will come back for more, trying out some other specialty. The place a bit dim thou and small.

Part of the attraction of Ronin is that it is so hard to find. There is no sign, there is no number, there is nothing to suggest that there is even a coffee shop tucked away in this small insignificant street in Singapore.Dont be fooled, this is the real deal. After 10 years of seeking out the best coffee in Singapore, and thinking I had found it before, I now know that it's at Ronin.We had late breakfast with lovely sourdough bread, eggs and coffee. Oh and they had real fig jam. Yum.So if you can find it, enjoy, If not thats fine, more room for me

Dim as it is, I was surprised that a group of people were there having a presentation/meeting. We had the dirty Ronin and roast beef sandwiches. Both were good, but the first was slightly more outstanding due to its mix of soft egg and chorizo and a piece of crisp lettuce. The moment I had the mint mocha I was ready to order another one.

This café is difficult to find unless you know its address. Otherwise there is no signage at all depicting its name or it being even a café. You can walk past it without even noticing it. That being said, there were a lot of return customers, during my visit there. There is no menu handed out, the only menus are what are hung onto the walls. Refer to the one nearer to the main entrance for the full drinks menu. They open usually from 8am to 6pm, so If you need your cuppa early, this is the place. Place was a little dark, guess that was the atmosphere they were trying to create, seats are limited. Was there around 10am so managed to get seats, the staff came to us and got our orders. Ordered The Wicked (hot/cold) and the Brioche French Toast and scrambled eggs with toast (you can order add-ons, e.g sausage, avocado etc).Coffee was good. Food was also nicely done. The Brioche French Toast are for those with sweet tooth as it was covered with syrup. The scrambled eggs and toast were nicely done, sausage was good too. Think this café runs on trust though I suppose, as the staff did not quite know what we ordered when I was paying, had to repeat what I had taken. Something not so easy if you are with a big group. All in all the service was good and the food and coffee great. So a nice cozy hangout place

The first thing about this place is that it's a little hard to find. It's set a little way back from the street, and there's no sign outside so you really need to know where to look.Once you find it though, it's a quaint little place with decent coffee and small but sufficient menu. Best time to go would be breakfast I suppose

Sure its dark, but it was early and a bit dim is just fine. The coffee was good and the menu worked for me. Scrambled eggs w excellent lamb sausage. My guest ordered a "*Dirty Ronan" leaving me scrambling for Urban Dictionary. Thankfully the menu described it as a toasted sandwich based on chorizo and nothing too kinky. Apparently excellent. All in all a good place for breakfast on the edge of town and not a hotel buffet

My husband and I had a little hard time looking for the place because the signage is quite not noticeable. The cafe's industrial looking interior has very poor lighting. Coffee and food prices are expensive. But one thing we can not forget, the server...hahaha, she's wearing a very, very, very short shorts, nose pierced with ring like a cow, with fake eye color (contact lenses), looks like she just got out of the bed after _ _ _, then will take your order and serve your food. I hope the owner will not get offended, just an observation to help them improve the quality of their service. I like their coffee and Brioche French Toast though

Overall nothing to shout about. Very dark place to begin with, can't do much work as its dark and noisy, maybe just chatting over coffee and food. The coffee is mediocre, the food was good. Had the brioche French toast, overall good dish but simply sinful with tons of maple syrup and oil and fatty bacon.

As we got ourselves seated, we were asked for our choice of coffee, as if we already know what to order. Then again, most of the patrons were either returning customers or people like me who were driven by online recommendations of their signature drinks, in my case, The Wicked and Matcha Toning. Our Matcha Toning and The Wicked arrived with much awe, the former’s dual tone catching our camera’s attention while the latter, a minty mocha with a mint leave to match, captivated our tastebuds. We added an order of Brioche French Toast to go with the drinks, which soft fluffy brioche earned our praises although the health conscious among us resisted from spreading too much syrup onto the bread
