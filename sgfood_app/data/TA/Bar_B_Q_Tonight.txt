The kebabs are really nice and highly recommended. Specially recommend the chicken behari kebab. Melts in the mouth

I have enjoyed eating at BBQ Tonite for several years. Recently though the service standards have fallen.

Nice-- good food and good value in a pretty basic place. Not super elegant but great for pakistani food fix

I love their grilled stuff. Curries are not good. They are good in grilled stuff.
Qandhari Nan are the best.
Dessert menu is Crap.

Bar B Q tonight is one good food chain in pakistan and maintains same spicy taste here in singapore. Ambiance and cleanliness are other imp factors which we can't neglect as well.
In total 5 marks specially when u r tired and hungry.

whenever i came to singapore i visit this place. i love their Grill. they offered Buffet too. very tasty all kind of grill. don't try chick curry. they are specialize in Grill menu. this is what i found.

I visited here with my family and we had buffet for dinner, food was relatively good but it was on the expensive side. I think it was about 30 Singapore Dollar per person (including tax). The La carte items were also expensive
3
I read about this place in Trip Advisor and since we were staying close, decided to try it during their buffet offering time.The people were ncie and treated us well. The restaurant is modest but clean. The buffet? I thought BarBQ and unique Pakastani I would taste some new things. If you have eaten at any lunch or weekend buffet at an Indian restaurant, in my opinion opinion you have tried it. Experts may tell me its different to it to me was the same right down to the Tandori chicken, nan and flower tasting dessert

Make sure you dont eat anything for a day before you turn up! So you should be sensible for the buffet but when the food is this good you will most likely overeat! The meat and vegetarian dishes are really tasty! There dessert options seemed a little limited but i didnt get around to trying them! Very good food at a reasonable price!RegardsOma

Booked buffet dinner for 6 people. Buffet dishes refilled very slowly specially the BBQ items - there was only one proper BBQ item "Seekh Kebab" then they had lamb ribs which we were told earlier will be lamb chops.Felt like wasted money and the guests didnt enjoy as well
3
We liked the starters they have - kebabs. Main course was not good. We didn't like the biriyani they served. It was too plain and less spicy.
All the starters we had were amazing and would visit again only for the starters.
5
The restaurant is small but nice and clean place.
There is an option for buffet or a la carte depending on your mood.
The food is awesome and gives a feeling of being back home in Pakistan.
The serving sizes are quite good.

Very good Pakistani food but can be inconsistent at times.Whats excellent : Reshmi Kebabs, Malai Tikkas, Afghani Boti, Lamb Ribs. Add some yougurt sauce (or smother it if you prefer) . Have these with hot naans and every bite is an explosion of flavours - spicy, creamy, a little tangy and a generous slice of delicious fat if you are having the ribs. Take a bowl of their Chicken Karahi or Ginger Chicken and dip the hot Naans - the occasional piece of garlic and/or green chilli adds to the medley of flavours. Pakistani food at its best! Their Sunday Brunch is as Pakistani as a breakfast gets. Among the vegetables, you have to try the Khattay Baingan (Sour Brinjal) or Bhindi (Ladiesfinger / Okra). What is average (can be good at times) : Biryani, Koftay (Meatballs), Mixed Vegetables. Fish Tikka. Tandoori Boti.If you know what to order, every meal can be pure joy ..

Went for dinner with the family of four on a week night. We were about the only customers there around 8.00 pm Chose the alarcate menu rather than buffet which had quite limited dishes The half grilled meats platter was enough for about 3 pax, was OK. But the biryani rice which was layered at the bottom was too little. Some naans & pallak paneer and mutton keema to supplement. Overall, food quality and taste was OK but agree with other Reviewers, "Service was zero". Food items on the Alarcate menu was rather pricey. Don't think will be going back anytime soon

Bar B Q Tonight has a lunch buffet priced at $20. Naan, dal, a vegetable dish, two tandoori items, a biriyani. Ample portions but of average quality. For the price, there are a lot of places nearby that offer better fare. But I heard their tandoor platter is good value for takeaways.
5
We went here to try their buffet. All meat dishes were very tasty along with the perfectly made naans. It is also one of the more fancy restaurants in the area (but nothing overwhelming). It was a little expensive but I guess that is what you have to expect.I highly recommend this place if you are in the area

So this restaurant is a franchise of the company based in Pakistan. Fairly small restaurant in Singapore, one in Karachi Pakistan is very large in size from what I remember from years agoVisited twice on visit to Singapore. went for the buffet on first visit, chose from the menu on second visit. Photos are from first visit.Restaurant is nice and clean and has a cool and relaxed atmosphere.Buffet - Ok value and fairly satisfied overall, fresh and tasty food. Chicken Biryani could have tasted a bit better, Chicken Kofta - chicken seemed a little under cookedOff menu - The main item that stood out for me was the Lamb Seekh Kebabs, fresh, meaty hot very spicy and delicious
4
Super place. Owned by a Pakistani, this place offers sumptuous kebabs and non veg combos that are Super value for money: chicken and mutton kebabs, Biryani , naan, chutneys: all are delicious. Most combos are priced between 12-15 SGD and a la carte menu is available too. Perfect for a luncheon as well as a family visit
5
Simply sensational! If you go there for the food and not the ambiance, you will not be disappointed! My favourites are Karhai Chicken, Chicken Ginger, Ribs and Brain Masala....! Pakistani food doesn't get better. Try their amazing Sunday brunches and you're highly likely to be back for more ......

Just had dinner tonight at this amazing restaurant. Chicken kebab with lamb Biryani Amazing taste, meat was tender and delish.It's located in little India, neighbourhood is very busy with hustle and bustle of late night shoppers. A good place for a late night meal. Do visit here, strongly recommend
4
My experience is quite good with BBQ tonight. There food is nice, though choice is limited. Their kebab, biriani are different n praise worthy. Drinks is also good. Overall, u'll feel like to come bank again. Cost effective indeed.

After having pakistani style bbq dishes in this restaurant, we stopped going to Indian restaurants in singapore.
4
Although not as tasty as the original Karachi Branch, but it's nevertheless very tasty. We tried the buffet for 3 people because individual orders might prove to be very expensive.
The fried fish was really nice!
4
i visited the branch in lil' India. its clean. and the service is very fast. i loved the location too. very convenient if you are shopping in little India and wanted a good meal afterward
4
Excellent Kebabs. Buffet is great value if you go on time. Service is very friendly. Warm bread keeps coming from the kitchen. Great location. Owners take interest in client experience.

Located in the midst of teh generally crowded Little India its a neat little restaurant. It has tables with cloths and a buffet service too. A la crte menu of north indian dishes particularly ke]babs are its speciality. It also makes delicacies like Goat ankles and other parst like brain but thses are an acquired taste
1
Went there on a date based on trip advisor reviews...the food was dry and fairly tasteless. the naan wasn't bad, but don't think i've ever had really bad naan. And the service was so-so as well. The chefs took a break when we arrived to break their fast (would have been nice to have a head's up when we made the reservation)...so we had to wait 15 minutes to order so perhaps the food we received was left out during their eating time...who knows...won't be going back

Visited here on 03/01/15 for dinner. They had dinner buffet at SGD$25+ per pax but it was't much of a spread hence we decided to go ala-carte. We ordered the BBQ platter for 2 that had fish, lamb, beef, chix and briyani rice. I especially love the fish kebabs as they were really juicy and full of flavours. Also had the garlic naans which was just ok. Really enjoyed the platter! Will be back with the rest of the family

Wandered into this totally unpretentious Indian restaurant after an evening in the surrounding markets. This very clean place, sporting white table cloths (changed each patron), a buffet option (we didn't try) and an a-la-carte menu consisting of a medium array of Indian dishes. We opted for the half Bar B Q feast consisting of chicken kebab, lamb chops, grilled prawns, chicken breast skewers and lamb kebab + basmati rice. The size was more than enough for two hungry men. In addition we ordered a portion of garlic Naan bread and Lasi drink.The well seasoned meat was prepared to order and was a very good one. The key to an excellent dinner was fresh ingredients, good seasoning, dishes prepared to order and reasonable pricing. The above mentioned dinner cost us a total of 47 SGD. Will definitely return when next time in town

this place tucked away on Stanley street is a must visit for foodies !!excellent kababs, served on a platter of saffron rice , in a very friendly , family ambience . A must for those who love meat and fish though there is a limited vegetarian choice . The lunch time has a buffet spread . Please book in advance to avoid disappointment . The cuisine is mainly Pakistani / north west frontier type with more grilled food than fried . There isn't much of a dessert choice though but then the flavour and the delicate blend of spice and the awesome taste of the food make up for it . As I say who wants a dessert after this delectable meal !!

Amazing kebabs and their buffet is an outstanding value for money, in particular the lunch buffet which is very reasonably priced.
5
Best value set meal, buffet also available, great food, nice environment, good place for lunch with office colleagues.
5
My family went recently and we had the platter. It was good! I like the lamb ribs and fish most. Very reasonably priced.

Not the one we have in Karachi but if you just arrived in Singapore and very hungry then go straight there and have reshmi kebabs, biryani and prawn masala. I have no regrets accept the locality.

Situated on Robert Lane, off Serangoon Road, Bar B Q Tonightâ€™s ambiance is as uninspiring as the general surrounds in that locale. It may be located in one of the smarter blocks in that area, but there no effort has been made to take advantage of that in any other aspect- the ambiance is that of a canteen, with equally befitting furniture and decor. The cuisine is mixed- typical Indian dishes, kebabs and barbequed chicken, fish and the like. As such, although billed as a barbeque venue, with an Indian flavor, the overall menu is ambiguous as to the real specialty of the place, and the staff is equally clueless. The lunch buffet was served in the most casual manner and most of the items served (except for the kebab perhaps) would perhaps be inedible to seasoned patrons. The staff are an apathetic lot (personified by the equally bored manager and a cashier seated on entry), most probably a reflection of the general management attitude. By local standards Bar B Q Tonight may be an attractive option (we ended up there by invitation), but definitely not worth a visit if you are looking for some class, with food to match- especially with the choices Singapore has to offer

Definitely one of the best Pakistani/Indian restaurant in Singapore. Best Value for Money definitely!!! (S$25 per person approx.). I love their Kebabs, Afghani Tikka, Malai Tikka and Khandaari Naan. Love their taste, reminds me of the parent chain in Pakistan. I have tried a lot of other restaurants in Singapore of the same genre but I can say this is the best amongst all.Seating can be limited in peak hours so a reservation is always helpful.They also serve all-you-can-eat-buffets, prices are reasonable and special the Sunday Brunch is very good deal with good assortment of dishes. I personally prefer orderign ala carte as me and my wife have a couple of favorites.Service is not top notch, the waiters may skip you a couple of times, but it is because buffets are self service. When we go in groups, we usually ask them to serve the Naans fresh to our tables and they always oblige.High Recommended!!
5
The restaurant has authentic Pakistani food, and the value is amazing! This is perhaps the best Pakistani/North Indian style BBQ place in the city and their buffet lunch and dinners are just outstanding. I went there almost a dozen times during my one year stay in Singapore and was never disappointed with the quality and authenticity of the food and service. Please note that the restaurant is extremely busy and making an advance reservation is highly recommended

Kebabs (Kababs) have always been a draw for most people who like Indian or Mediterranean food, however Bar-b-q Tonight stands out as one of the best places to really enjoy kababs.. i'm a foodie and make Indian (or pakistani- almost the same thing) kababs at home, and my family does a pretty good job of it, so eating kababs outside usually has some or the other complains.. however bar-b-q tonight is one exception where i have eaten some of the best kababs in Singapore. Strongly recommended: Sunday brunch (12 noon onwards) for their Nahari and Paya (for those who love it know how hard it is to get good nahari/paya).. the unique afghani bread goes well with the nahari/paya too!! :)Also in the regular days dont miss the Chicken Seekh,& fish kabab... and also the malai chicken tikkai've seem mixed feedback on the ribs, but i think the fact remains that this is one of those rare places in singapore where you will get mutton ribs/rack.my mouth waters when i think of the Nahari & Paya at the Sunday brunch... its been a year since i've made so many trips to Bar b q tonight.. its also one of those places i like to take my friends/family to enjoy kababs outside of my home!! I do hope you enjoy it as much as i do

Heard about this place from a friend who advised me that this place serves a decent spread of North Indian food as lunch buffet so decided to try it out from work. Was a bit surprised to see the place less than half full on a Tuesday lunch but was pleasantly surprised with the decent range of dishes,, 5-6 chicken dishes and 1 fish in addition to 1 lame soup, fruit salad as dessert and 1-2 veggies. Overall food taste was great but bit annoying to have a manager continuously watching while you eat. Then realised he tries his best to take your used plate away immediately once your done with a helping. Lunch Buffet was very affordable at 15$ and would advise a visit if you love to hog or a big fan of North Indian chicken cuisine

Buffet dinner was 25 S$ pp. I saw no service charge on bill. My can coke zero was only 2 S$. Large spread of food options. Mixture of starters and mains. And a desert with fruit too. Chance that with big tables if people your favorite dish might get finished and not replaced in time. Just ask for it. Either way, you should get a chance to enjoy tasty lamb ribs, soft yummy tikka fish, butter chicken (saw it one minute it was gone the next), kebabs, wings, and also nice veg options. So there are lots to choose from for many tastes. Food was not spicy yet tasty. We really enjoyed the food. Service was o okay. Place was clean. I'd take my visitors there to enjoy North Indian food with a Pakistani flair.For light eaters you can choose from ala carte menu. Another option. Make sure to try the dessert. Called Keer.
