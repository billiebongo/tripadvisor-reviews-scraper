The beef noodles here is good. Beef is tasty with a nice chewiness and soup is flavourful. Only grip is that the portions keep getting smaller.
5
a nice warm meal for cold days, the beef soup is yummy and really hits the spot. prices are rather reasonable considering the CBD location. 3rd time here in 3 months, and counting.
3
The order is done through an ipad, a modern twist to this otherwise traditional food stall. The beef noodle soup is similar to the Vietnamese pho with some minor tweaks. The taste is quite ok and the price is not unreasonable.
4
Slightly pricey for this kind of local flavor dish but the quality of the beef and gravy and noodle is excellent.

This is apparently an institution but my 1st time here. Not crowded during chinese new year eve and i assume it's packed during normal days
The noodles are tasty and the herbal broth packs a delicious albeit salty/msg punch

My wife and I visited ARC twice to eat at Hock Lam Beef in Feb 2018.We missed both the soup and the dry beef kway teoh because of the closure of Far East Square.Hock Lam Street used to be opposite Fort Canning Fire Station. I used to attend Anglo Chinese Primary School at Fort Canning in the 60s . More than half a century had passed and we followed Hock Lam Beef from where it was to the shop houses, malls and shopping centres to eat our favourite beef noodle.We strongly recommend beef noodle lovers to come to ARC and eat Hock Lam Beef to support a part of our Singapore culinary history
3
Taste OK but not impressive, with strong Chinese herb in the soup base, quite small portion per bowl. The worst thing is that it is stated in the official page the opening hour till 21:00. However, closed at 18:00 on Sunday and closed at 20:00 tonite ((Monday)

Visited the ARC outlet. Order done through an iPad. Easy to order. Ordered the dry version - salty. Thirsty the whole day. $8.90 for a bowl. A bit pricey. The beef was tender, but they only give 1/2 bowl of small soup. Have to ask them for extra.
3
We order our Favourite beef noodle soup. The only thing I don't like is the sweet taste in the beef broth. Meat was tender n noodles was cooked perfectly. Chili sauce isn't enough for us though.We also decided to order homemade chives dumplings 6 pcs for $6.90 and unfortunately they were uneven in size n dumpling skin were torn so the chives taste is not pungent
4
The area around China Square has some quite expensive and/or boring restaurants. We found this place on a round-the-block scout for a low key dinner.The menu is a bit confusing for westerners, but with help from the waiter we made our choices. We wound up with a bowl of beef and noodle soup, a creamy coleslaw and some interesting croquettes with meat in the middle and a deep fried crust of taro. The latter were for us totally novel, and delicious.Well worth a visit if you are in the vicinity and looking for cheap but tasty meal
5
The best beef noodles I had eaten in my life. Good reasonable price and perfect service. The homemade barley was really good and fresh. I bought a bottle of their homemade chili back with me and it was wonderful. My family loved it.

Meal - Bought the sliced beef set, noodles and beef was good.Only 2 tables were occupied but still nobody was willing to engage us. No explaination or anything even though its our first time there. Good thing was that no service charges if not I will rate the service as terrible

The Hock Lam beef noodle of my youth re-surfaced as an absolute joke at Ion Orchard. This silliness of ordering through an iPad makes the entire experience utterly stupid, considering the restaurant is never packed. (Surely someone is making money from government grants to deploy technology? Or has the eatery been talked into buying these iPads?) Prices are atrocious - 50 cents for a glass of warm water?! I had a barley water instead while my associate asked for warm water. We were urged to buy a plate of tasteless taro dumplings at nearly S$8; my associate and I each had a bowl of beef noodle and long story short, the bill came up to $32.70. Being pricey is one thing but both of us didn't finish our noodles or those horrid taro dumplings simply because this was the worst meal we've had so far this year. The same meal could be had at a food court for less than 15 bucks; and it would taste a thousand time nicer.I'll be very surprised if this eatery is still there this time next year. I cannot recommend this place at all

Tried the new outlet at Ion Orchard. To counter the labour shortage issues, they have gone hi-tech, with ordering by iPad! The beef noodles are realiably good, and they have a few sides, none memorable though. You can add meat items (brisket, tendon, etc) to your noodle soup, but they charge an exorbitant $2-2.50 per tiny portion! This restaurant stands next to a Vietnamese one (Wrap and Roll), and frankly the latter offers more food variety - now whether you prefer Hock Lam beef noodles or phở depends on where you grow up, although there are more phở joints in the world than beef noodle soup eateries
4
Everything I ordered was delicious, be it the sides or rich broth or tasty soup or the many beef parts. Cheap and very good value for beef and location too. Love the way the menu works e.g. can add on beef parts and there are many types of noodles/sets as it ensures that you get to try everything
4
The noodle is pretty tasty, the beef is tender, and the soup is rich. Most importantly to me is that the old uncle working in the restaurant is super nice. Good service is something that the Singapore's food industry really lacks. Keep up the good work Hock Lam!

There are quite a few Hock Lam Beef (HLB) food restaurants in Singapore. I typically go to Alexandra Retail Center (ARC) branch. Since the quality control is good, all outlets are generally the same. I will almost always order hand sliced beef noodle keow tiao soup. I prefer it with a squeeze of lime and I will mix in the provided salted vegetables with chopped parsley. Since I live the soup, I will request for less noodles and extra hand sliced beef. This ensures the soup is not diluted by the noodles, with a stronger beefy flavor.In terms of drinks I like the lime juice.Sometimes I will also order an extra old garlic stir fried Kai Lan.I have been coming to HLB for quite a few years, so far it has not disappointed me no matter which branch I visit. In terms of taste and speed of service.

As for the lady Boss Tina if you are lucky to see her and she will tell you how it all started more than a century ago till today. I wont tell you more. Tasting is believing and no regrets. However just note that if you are going for the soup option, it could be a tat heavy on the herbs seasoning otherwise its perfect

Very exotic taste of the broth, more like a stew with herbs, soft beef served with either thick or flat noodles. Along comes either chicken nuggets or coleslaw latter being the healthier choice indeed. For those who like chilli, chilli dip is given separately and get to choose either lemon juice or lime barley drink. They have variation in the beef size with thinly sliced to small pieces. You can choose mixed variation. You can order both gravy style or soup style.Tips:Go for the gravy as you can enjoy the taste better and you get the soup separately with this.The outlet in the china town is the origina one. Go either early or after 1 30 to avoid too much rushAlso long queue in the outlet near Clarke Quay. So beef up and enjoy.

This is the place to try out the original beef noodle. The place, despite its modern look is located exactly at the same spot when it was opened 'reportedly' a century ago. But it is now fully commercialized. You order your dishes according to pre-determined menu: brisket, tenderloins, intestines or just beef balls. Even the drinks come pre-packaged. But no worries, since this is a hot dish, you can assured that the main ingredient -- the soup, it thoroughly prepared from stock
3
Food quality dropped a little but perhaps they could raise the value of the product, instead of raising the prices. It's a shame it's no longer as affordable to dine there as often as I want to.
4
We went here during lunch time, and getting a table was still easy though (just right after 12nn). Tasty clear broth, true beef taste..that's it!
4
The beef noodle standard still there. If one like Vietnamese pho, one will like hock lam beef whose herbal broth/soup is more tasty than pho soup. Several herbs are used to make the broth/soup. Hand sliced beef is tender and tasty. I went to outlet at Alexandra Retail Centre (ARC). The chilli sauce is well paired with the beef. Inexpensive casual dining. Electronic ordering via APPLE iPAD was quite intuitve and efficent. Home made barley drink is also recommended

This is a legendary shop that was my father's favourite lunch meal since the 1970s. The quality is just as superb, with fragrant herbal spices that are perfect in the gravy and soup. I had the pure tendon kway teow noodles, "specially for beef noodle connoisseurs" as stated in the menu. The tendon was soft and tasty, rich in collagen and very nutritious. The Mixed beef and beef balls were delicious too - tender perfectly sliced beef and bouncy beef balls. The only difference from what I remembered as a child was that the hot coffee shop I remembered is now a cool and functional cafe. Service was attentive and prompt.

Tried their new outlet at Ion Orchard on Boxing Day. The lady boss, daughter of the founder, was there, cooking a storm in the kitchen! Talk about dedication! Taste wise, my bowl of beef noodles (in sauce, beef only) was good, the taste I grew up with. But the accompanying bowl of broth was too salty. Portion wise, everything seems to have shrunk, from the crushed peanuts on the noodles to the beef. Price is now $9.90 for a regular bowl. But I guess if you eat in Orchard, and you want to help raise service staff wages, there is no other choice.

the best way to describe it is herbal pho. the broth is rich with herbs which gives it a dark hue. you can choose the type of toppings/beef you will have and an option to choose the noodles as well. it's filling perfect for a grumbling tummy
4
location - easy parking @ far east squarepremise - slightly hot due to open air environment. do not attempt to go unless early, it is always full! the branch at ARC (Alexandra Retail Mall) is the same unless on weekendsstaff - helpful and willingprice - expensive but worth it previously when you could have your own take at the preserved veg and other condimentsportion - big and quite filling, they do a non-carb option as well, just meat and veg - this one with their gravy!? KILLER DISH!verdict - have an easy lunch / dinner on weekends. i prefer how they served previously where it was self-serve but you had the luxury of adding your condiments to your hearts content. quality is still good as per way back. they have more side dishes now though

Nested in the CBD of Singapore, Hock Lam beef noodle is one of the must try in this island city. This beef noodle has a long history and now is run by the 3rd generation of the family.My favourite is the dry version of the noodle, that comes with thick gravy. I wasn't a beef lover before, after trying this - i become a convert! It is one of my must have lunch at least 2x a month.Lunch hour will be packed cos of the nearby office workers, so be a little early at around 1145am, if you want to get a seat and enjoy a bowl of yummy beef noddles. also do try their chicken wings - honey glaze or ginger....absolutely great.prices are reasonable < $10 a bowl.Checkout their history before you make a trip down to Hock Lam Beef noodlehttp://www.hocklambeef.com/blog/index.php/media-reviews

was craving for beef noodle soup in china street which used to be very nice with friendly staff but they changed. went there at 8.20pm and they told me sorry closed so after asking what time is the last order they told me 8.30pm but now already closed. really disappointing and bad customer service. was a regular customer in the china street outlet and alexandra outlet but won't go there anymore

This is the new Hock Lam Beef outlet @ the Alexandra Retail Centre (ARC). The soup and dry versions were very good. You select your combination - the type of broth, type of noodle, type of beef (sliced, chunky, balls). This is like Vietnamese Pho except less vegetable ingredients than the Viet or Thia versions. Hock Lam beef were tender, broth has herbal flavour and somewhat spicy but no chillies. Orders were served very quickly.No free water - S$0.50 per glass of still water. Homemade barley is one of their popular drinks. See www.hocklambeef.co

Cheap and good

Supa dupa solid...supa standards are way above copycats from circular and purvis..service was excellent too...love esp. the soup and gravy...beef is so tender and the parts are so chunky and generous
3
Above average beef noodle place. I prefer the one nearby, the old national library beef kway teow.

xcellent beef noodles

No, I didn't like it. Not as good as I'd expected.

I grew up eating this same beef noodles when they were at the Capitol theater. read about them through the net and when I was back in Singapore last year, I just had to go a taste it for myself if it was true that the same recipes has been used since the early days. Having lived abroad I only have short annual visits and this was a trip I had to make. i must say that i was not at all disappointed...as i sipped on the soup all my past taste buds were revisited and if not for my high ferratin count i would have indulged on a second bowl. I would certainly go back again my next visit to my heartland
3
Maybe for the fact that i am a singaporean (growing up eating beef noodles), the taste of this beef noodles is average, and nothing to shout about. A good place to fulfill your desire to have a simple bowl of beef noodles, no frills and self service.

That was quite some time ago, my colleague Tabao back their beef noodle for my lunch, I was totally feel that's really worthy queuing (as he queued for at least 30 mins during lunch time).I happened to be extremely craving for beef noodle since last week, however I just had NO time to visit Hock Lam although it's sort of somewhere close by my office. And I finally today I went there at almost 1:30 PM, the queue was not that long as compared to the real lunch time, but still got at least 10 people queuing in front of me. I was totally satisfied my craving! And you will feel everything is just so perfect even you know you still need to back to work right after the beef noodle.The soup, perfect!The beef ball, my favorite, is just so nice and chewy. I hope I can have their beef noodle again soon
