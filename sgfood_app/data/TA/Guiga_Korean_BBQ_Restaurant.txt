Food was okay, banchan was not too my liking except the kimchi which was nicely fermented. Kimchi pancake and sundubu way so-so, grilled pork belly was lack in seasoning and on the hard side, but price was reasonable.

Wanted a simple Kimchi stew for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! It was really good!!! Not too salty not spicy and the amount was just nice for a simple lunch.
I love their side dishes, especially the Kimchi!
Very friendly staff! Nice cosy restaurant:)

The place is a bit underwhelming with staff not being that helpful to help you decide and prices being a bit high for the quality and quantity of the food.
There are better places to go.

Stepped into this restaurant after working on a Sunday. Usually frequented this place for lunch.
Ordered their pork set at $49. Portion was sufficient for 2 persons. The staff gave us a complimentary mini pot of steamed egg.
Definitely worth a try.

The meat were all fresh and nicely bbq by the server. Army stew and other dishes were good. Full house and a fair and simple Q system which worked even though they were clearly short handed on the night. Excellent service and they served with smiles.

The meat here is very fresh and marinated nicely. The portion of the food served are generous too. We can constantly ask for refill of the fresh vegetables for the BBQ meat as well as the condiments and side dish.The staff here are all very friendly and helpful. They will be more than willing to help you grilled your meat if you are too lazy or worry that you get burnt by the oil.The only con is that your clothes and hair will smell of BBQ smoke after your meal. So do not eat here if you are going for your night out

Really fun and friendly place with great staff and service. It's in a very pretty building and inside decor works. menu and quality of food is great .The staff come and cook infront of you, which helps. Meat quality is good . The only problem is that despite the fans ,one still comes out smelling , same for any Korean BBQ.No need to book during the week , but give it a try

We ordered a plate of thinly sliced pork (2mm) and regular ones (5mm). But it's tastes so much better with the regular ones. The thin sliced pork taste like bland bacon. The cold noodle was another mistake we ordered. It's practically tasteless and 2 Adult couldn't finished it. However,the side dishes were amazing. The kimchi was well season and we couldn't stop eating it! Ordered a small pot of kimchi jjigae. That was amazing too!We ordered a bottle of Korean beer (Hite) to flush things down but it never showed up and we had to tell the server to remove it from our bill. Overall,it's nice food in a small crowded restaurant with average service

We visited this place due to a crazing for Korean BBQ and it is one of the few that comes up on Google with a general search.In this area there are a wealth of Korean BBQ places of varying quality. Guiga is very good, good portion and neither expensive nor inexpensive by Singaporean standards of price.The restaurant could do with a little maintenance but is very popular and was comfortably busy while we were there. It was a little annoying the trouble that the waiters had lighting our BBQ and constantly attempting to relight it.The menu is not very diverse and quite a few meat options such as chicken wings missing and not many options with regards to side orders.What they do produce, they produce well and this location is worth a visit but I would also suggest having a wander down the road and picking whichever restaurant catches your fancy

Dropped by Guiga last evening in our search for an authentic Korean meal, having tried 2 other stalls over the past 7 days. It was a very good experience at Guiga. The staff were very friendly and guided us through the menu (3 of us). They did caution us that we may have ordered a bit too much but we went ahead anyway. The marinated beef was superb and so was the Sundubu. Will certainly go there again with the wider family

Excellent Korean BBQ!
Meat was tender. Love the tofu stew & cold noodle! Add on the prompt & friendly service, my family had a delightful dining experience.
4
The charcoal grilled beef was excellent. The side dishes was good and steam egg (which was complimentary) was well done. Would go back again. Cosy place
4
Very close to the Carlton City hotel. The pancake was great. Did not have the traditional BBQ as it was quite expensive. Overall a pretty good meal
5
The spicy octopus stir fry is very good. Atmosphere is relaxed. Staff is polite and accommodating. Definitely worth a stop if you enjoy Korean food
5
We had lunch our lunch here after walking around, finding some place where we can eat during the Chinese New Year celebration as majority of shops were closed at that time.The staff are very helpful in cooking the meat so we can enjoy eating. We had lots of refill for the side dishes and lettuce wraps for the cooked meat.Overall experience was excellent

Visited twice with friends. The sides were nice, the marinated and original taste of bbq were nice! Overall happy with the foods. The waiters were friendly. Just that a bit noisy as usually busy, and a bit "smoky", think that the ventilation n "smoke exhaust" system could be improved. A worth-visit korean Bbq restaurant, will definately go again
5
Well as the title say it has been a very good experience and not just for me, the restaurant is always full infact sometimes is hard to find place, i post some pictures, the most important that i have to say about is that the service is not only caring about the food but specially they care about the persons and it is a quality that you dont find easyly at any place... thank yo

Our stomachs were very much satisfied as food was definitely amazing proven by the reviews here. Shout out to cheese lovers, go ahead and try out the egg roll, the melted cheese hidden in it is unbearable despite it being a huge portion (& pricey).Moreover, I would like complement the staff by the name of Prabeet, who was all smiles throughout his service! Have to admit we were quite demanding (JUST A LITTLE!!) asking for the free sides so many times, but he was patient enough and smiles almost immediately whenever we asked for more. Personally as hospitality students we were very delighted to come across people like this, which brings us memories back in poly days. Thus, GOOD JOB PRABEET AND KEEP IT UP! I promise one day you will be outstanding!! :

I was staying in Carlton City Hotel and strolled out to see this nice restaurant on the corner - Having only eaten English Korean food before I wasn't sure what to expect. I asked the staff about ingredients and I opted for YukGaeJang and I was not disappointed. It was very hot, brought in a sizzling bowl with several sides, it was very spicy, just how I like my food :) I wanted to go back every night but opted to try other places as my time was limited, but when I return next year, this will be where I have my first meal in Singapore :

First visit love it very much. Food was awesome and service was fantastic . Guess this is the first Korean bbq restaurant which I found that food was great ! I can't find any authentic bbq restaurant in Tanjong Pagar. The staff was attentive and polite. It is worth trying 
5
Their food tastes great! I have come here several times, even bring my family. Their service is prompt and never lose courtesy, even on busy weekend dinner. They are very generous with their side dishes and food price is reasonable. I love this Korean restaurant.

This Resto at Tanjong Pagar, are good and delicious especially for beef menu, you must try and come at the right time, if not you will find no seat. Great Food!
5
The beef here is so nice!!! And seafood pancake also:)Environment also not so bad, I think I will come again and try to find out more delicious food
5
The food here is brilliant. Most authentic Korean I had in Singapore. Highly recommend the beef set.
The staff will help u out if you struggle with the bbq.

This has become my favourite as the staff are so friendly, and the selection of food is great. And, it's not as expensive as others.I really enjoy going here, it's such a communal thing to do - the bbq and sharing. It's not quite the hotpot experience I love. But it's close.You can get short ribs for example, that come with a selection of kimchi and other veggies. Free egg dish. Metal chopsticks take a bit of getting used to, but there we go.I'll miss the food from here when I leave

It's quite rare to find Korean BBQ places along Tanjong Pagar opened in the day time. But, I found one! Though not as rowdy as it is in the night time, Guiga serves decent lunch Ã  la carte dishes like Bibimbap, Kimchi Stew, Pork Sausage Stew, Beef Ribs Stew etc.The place has the remnants of the night before's BBQ smell but we were fine with that. It is, after all a Korean BBQ place!Our order:- Yukgaejang (): A hearty, spicy beef soup that's highly popular in Korea. Made with shredded beef, lots of scallions and other vegetables such as gosari (fernbrake fiddleheads), beansprouts, and mushrooms, this is a substantial soup that has great depth of flavor. If you love this but can't take too much spiciness, you can ask them to tone down the spice factor. Absolutely love this!- BiBimBap (): The so-called ultimate comfort Korean food. My friend's order was surprisingly just nice for her; not too much rich. The sauce was simply delicious though it might be slightly hot for some so be careful with the portion.The cold noodles () on the menu looks delicious and I will definitely be back to try it soon!P.s. the waitresses have a korean look but speaks very fluent chinese

Wouldn't say I am wow-ed by the food here, but service is excellent. Maybe because it is like 3pm on a Sunday afternoon?Most food on the menu is spicy ranging from mild to near explosive (well, to me taste buds they are near explosive..)We ordered a pork ribs dish...loads of chunky ribs, but hardly any pork on it. What was served didn't look like the picture at all - was disappointed with the dish

This is one of the many Korean restaurants in the Tanjong Pagar area and one of the better ones. They served authentic Korean food at affordable prices and long wait. Their individual set meals are good and varied and comes with the usual side dishes. You can ask for more of them as replenishment. Free flow ice water. Worth trying if you haven't been there and happened to want a quick Korean meal to whet your appetite

I was never a fan of Korean food but coming to Guiga has changed this perspective. I really found the food here delicious and I really liked the free flow of salad.We ordered the barbecue set 3 which contains beef & pork (can't remember which part of the cow or pig though), a pancake, and a steam egg dish. All this together with a bottle of wonderful Korean blackberry wine made my night.The staff in Guiga barbecued the meat cuts to perfection. One of the best I have eaten.The price was also very reasonable.Highly recommend this restaurant when I'm Singapore next

Staying nearby, and after leaving home 14 hours ago, wanted to not stray to far. Walked in and seated straight away at a clean table, but it did take some time for our order to be taken. However, nearly right away, the traditional Korean pickled vegetables side dishes, and rice appeared, soon after the main meal. My beef soup was indeed hot and spicy, and my wife's beef hot pot was loaded with meat. Other diners were having the traditional BBQ over hot rocks, and that looked great as well. Service was efficient after the slow start, and a complimentary egg omelet was provided. If staying in the Tangjong Pagar area, would recommend
