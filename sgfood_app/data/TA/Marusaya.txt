Authentic Japanese food. Would recommend to try their tamago and oden. Excellent customer services. Best to make reservations if going on weekends

Happened to come for lunch with colleagues last Friday since our office just nearby. Food served here are of very good quality. Decent place and value for money. Will drop by again in the future.

went there on a weekday for their set lunch and was glad to find that the place was nice and quiet. The set lunches were of a decent value and the service was not bad too. will consider going again.

Excellent Japanese food with a very extensive selection of food.We had the deep fried chicken which with the sauce was delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful at explaining the menu.

It would be better for the restaurant to serve according to the Flow of the meal.
I have the grilled fish served with the sashimi, which is ...
However overall the quality of food is good

Visited with my wife. Food seemed good to us but I am no expert on Japanese food. Service very good even fetched us knife and fork to eat with

The food is not only small in portion but also terrible in taste. Though service is good, it's not worth the money.

What would you think if you'd waited patiently for nearly an hour in a very un-busy restaurant for a simple order of sushi for two and the food not only was not delivered but the waiter's excuse was that he'd forgotten to pass it on? How pathetic is that for any restaurant, let alone one with delusions of grandeur?We'd just arrived in town and were staying nearby, so tried to find a restaurant in the Robertson Quay restaurant strip at about 8.30 pm, and decided on this place. Not very Singaporean fare was available, but we were hungry, so we picked the easiest thing on the menu: sushi, thinking that that would make it quick.Not with this sort of pathetic non-service.We ordered drinks at the same time as the sushi, and they were delivered promptly, so we waited, and waited and waited, until I was finally moved to remind a passing waiter that we had placed an order some time ago. Nothing happened, although anywhere else such a gentle reminder would have produced immediate results. Remember, there were few patrons but many members of staff.After another ten minutes had passed I managed to flag down the waiter who had actually taken our order, and he finally confessed that he had not told anyone of our order of nearly an hour ago; mind you, even then he did not have the grace to waive the cost of the drinks and popped up with an over-priced bill for the local Tiger beer. Needless to say, as the order was still not even on the way, we left immediately and patronised the nearby 7/11 for a sandwich out of the fridge and a hot chocolate.So much for a pleasant introduction to Singapore.To answer my own question, yes, it is the worst restaurant in Singapore, as subsequently we found only really excellent ones.The Marusaya is appalling.Avoid it like the plague

Great honest well presented Japanese food with very attentive service to top up the great location with outdoors seating. Robertson is a great location for dinner.Food is fantastic. The menu is not that long. but the offerings are great.Singaporean prices here, so don't be surprised if you feel you're paying premium, because you are.But hey, food is great.

I stumbled on Marusaya walking along the Singapore River near the Copthorne Waterfront hotel. Lured in by cold Kirin Draft beer happy hour I was then pleasantly surprised to learn new revelations about ancient Japanese methods of preparing bonito or skip jack--which we typically don't eat in Florida. Katsuobushi; Boiled, smoked, dried and aged for two years then shaved off for garnish or chips with a Kirin. And Dashi. No MSG. All natural ancient process. Fabulous chilled seasonal summer salad and Unagi Odamaki Mushi (fish, noodle, hominy) soup with amazing Dashi flavor broth. Topped off with a jazz soundtrack from the 50's, a very pleasant staff, clean and cool ambience and a manager named "Cash" I've been here three days in a row. Bought shaved and whole bonito to take home to share and will be back as often as I can. So excited--don't blow it up yo?!Cheers! Yes you can get sushi and wagyu and shabu too but try the above..

Popped in here for lunch. Was quite food though a bit pricey. Service was very good and despite the price I would go back again.

Love their dashi ramen and potato salad. Their dashi are all natural made. Ambience is good and not too loud. Japanese seems to love here after work. Would come again for their dashi ramen. Service is great too. They have a lot of sake varieties to try

Quality of the food is high and one can enjoy the rich taste of the MSG free udon soup laden with katsumoboshi. Lunch sets come up with appetisers, pickles and dessert. The marbling on the wagyu sukiyaki was decent for its price and free upsize for the udon can be done on request. The pork on the niku jaga was also very soft and made for a very tasty dish.Although prices are not cheap, the dishes are made with quality ingredients and it shows up in the flavours. Lunch sets will be recommended to those who have a limited budget

Had a day out in Robinson Quay to watch the Australian open and it was astonishing to see Federer win against Nadal. Feeling hungry after three hours+ drinking beer and my girl friend wanted noodle soup so she got her way but it was a good way. Still on a diet I ordered a Baby sardine radish salad and wagyu rump steak. When the $28 steak came out wit two slices of potato I thought you are joking!!But I must admit I got positively surprised. The meat was extremely tender and it went really well with the salt, peppers and wasabi. The salad was huge so that made up for the small steak plate, but also very tasty and only $13. I could eat the salad on its own every day. Only downside was the lack of choice of wine by the glass - I had THE Merlot - ok and it only cost $7.77 per glass so not bad!!!Enough about me - my girlfriend had the Ramen noodles and missed a bit of taste in the broth But overall a Great day out

Marusaya is one of the numerous restaurants packed into Robertson Quay. No garish lights here, though, and you can easily pass it by if you are not looking out. We sat outside on high chairs under the trees, a pleasant experience on a balmy Singapore evening. The menu is substantial and covers quite a wide range of Japanese cuisine. We were four, plus two young children, and we all enjoyed what we ate. There's a very good ramen here, and if you like unagi, have some of Marusaya's. What else - giant prawn tempura (a challenge!), with good, though not great, tempura; sashimi of course; ohitashi; dashimaki tamago (Japanese "omelette"; and draft Kirin beer, plus lots of other beers, sake,sucho, wine and so on. The service was cheerful and good, the prices reasonable. We ate a lot and the bill left change out of S$200

Authentic favors, mild tastes in general. One of the better tasting Japanese restaurants in Singapore. It is expensive compared to Japan and a bit pricey for Sg. Frozen beer was interesting, but one is enough. Hard to drink without having to stick your nose in the frozen froth!! The renkon karage and the yaki nasu were very good. Service was good, friendly staff. Overall most dishes were quite nice, not much to disappoint. I would go back. A dinner for 4 with drinks can be around 4-500sgd. That is with a good bit of dishes ordered, the servings are a bit small.

This is a review that I'm almost reluctant to write. Marusaya is one of those gems that you prefer others don't learn about.Firstly the food. You can taste and see the first rate quality ingredients and the detailed effort made by the talented Japanese chef. Japanese expats and their families usually make up more than half the tables, so I'm guessing the food is pretty authentic. The restaurant's specialty is dashi which is a soup base made from bonito flakes and bones. This is used in their soup, noodle, shabu shabu and probably other dishes too. The menu is more extensive than expected, with many items completely new to me. Sea pineapples anyone? (It's not a plant).Next, the location. It's a small simple restaurant with wood paneled walls and super high ceilings, located on a quiet tree-lined stretch of Robertson Quay by the Singapore River. Just a 10min drive from CBD.Service is warm Japanese hospitality. You'll feel like you're in a quaint small- town Japanese inn.For this great food and service, you pay even less than CBD prices. Lunch sets around $20. My favorite is their 7-course "super value meal" @$58. I won't give more details, only that they've got to be making razor thin margin on this set.Here's the best part. There's a free private indoor Carpark just behind the restaurant. You access it by the rear entrance. There are only 8 lots though. So hopefully not too many learn about this hidden gem

I just love eating here. The standard is superbly high, as good as eating in Japan. Produce is fresh and it shows itself without much fanfare. Service is prompt when needed and disappears when not. Location is great with a view of the Singapore river. The dashi is fantastic. Do try.Highly recommended
