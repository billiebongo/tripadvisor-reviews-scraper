The specialty of this place is the Sunday champagne brunch. It's world buffet, and boy do you have to walk around if you want to sample all the food. It's so extensive that I could not sample everything. There's oyesters, there's steak, chops, sushi, sashimi, pasta, pizza, salads, Indian, Indonesian fare and some that I had definitely missed.All this comes with an unlimited flow of champagne! I never understood why you would do champagne brunch on Sundays and not Saturdays (Sundays to recuperate), but other that that, no complaints on the champagne. While not the creme-de-la-creme, the champagne is high grade and tastes nice.Food is consistently good 0 special mention to the oysters and the beef roast. The desserts trolleys are exhaustive as well.It's always full (and gets a bit crowdy and noisy) do book early

Went for set lunch at Mezza9 restaurant on second floor of Grand Hyatt hotel, and absolutely enjoyed it. Choice of starters, entrees and deserts is expansive - with a great mix of Asian and Western offers. Portion sizes, presentation, taste and freshness of dishes offered is truly a 5++ star experience. The ambience is very refined, yet still relaxed enough for my tastes. Finally, the level of service offered by the staff is just exceptional: super fast and friendly - with great attention to detail and making every guest feel welcome. We felt totally pampered. Overall, a great place for lunch, and good value, too. Will definitely come back

Sunday Brunch at possible one of the best places we have had a Sunday Brunch! On arrival we were shown promptly to our table where our waiter Loges explained the layout of the food / drinks to go with each menu and the fact you could do a 360 degree around the restaurant and finish back at our table. We have done a freeflow brunches but this was the best we have experienced. Loges thanks for such great service and keeping us topped up.

The food quality is as always excellent. I came partly for Foei gras but not available. The rest of Food was wow! Amazing martini bar n sake corner!!!I like to especially compliment today Daniel!!!!! He is the star!!!!!!!! He made our brunch very special n he gave my friend who did not drink an apple juice which made our photography brilliant!!!! The Apple juice looked like champagne!!!!Daniel from Hungary had great potential!!!! We like the magician/illusionist too!!!!! He was professional!!!New staff Ethan tried his best! Staff Kathuri was great!!!!! She is really pleasant.Kudos to chefs!!!! They all worked hard! I especially like the Japanese n cold sections!!Mezzanine 9 is always my favorite!!!! I don’t go to other brunches except mezzanine 9

Fabulous selection of food, from fresh lobster and beautiful roast meats to bread and butter pudding with custard. Oh yes my wife said the sashimi and oysters were first class. PJ champagne flowed freely courtesy of our delightful server. Can't think of a better brunch I've been t

 We dined at Mezze 9 on Friday and were disappointed with our meal. We sat at a table converted from a square table to a round table. As a result the leaflets were not level and the plates tended to slide off.The lobster bisque was lukewarm but worse was to follow. The main course of steak with gnocchi was cold and was still not much better when it was send back to be reheated.The subsequent bill of over $400.00. for 2 couples left a bitter taste in our mouths.We travel to Singapore quite often and would not consider returning to Mezze 9
4
This was my second visit at Mezza9. We were there for business after good meetings and all were in a good mood. Mezza9 was nicely decorated. It is especially pleasant to see the cooks in action. Two of us shared a fish they enjoyed. As mentioned elsewhere, the crispy noodle with lobster looks a lot better than it tastes. Luckily I could use some of the chili served with the fish to make it more interesting. Nice desert set

Saturday night for dinner.Opted for the set menu,3 courses for 79$.Table setting non existent,had to request pepper and salt.Opted for crab cakes entre,crispy noodles with lobster for main  and pancake for desert.My partner ordered steak and gnocchi The crabcackes were ok but basically quite bland,and the taste of crab very difficult to detect.Crispy noodles served in a large bowel,with pieces of lobster floating around and various vegetables,mushrooms,onions,and bits of greenery.The enormous serve was inversely proportional to the quality of this somewhat tasteless dish which was partially saved by adding a considerable quantity of chilli.My partners steak and gnocchi arrived cold and was sent back to be heated,which was not acceptable.Wines are outrageously overpriced so be very careful in this regard.The desert and coffee were goodStaff very pleasant.Can't recommend,poor value for mone

I'm not normally a buffet person - all that schlepping back and forth. But the standard of the food at this Sunday brunch made it absolutely worthwhile. The world was your oyster - and yes there were oysters alongside seafood and sushi and a carvery and cold cuts and Chinese and and and… And I will venture to say that at 150 SGD per head this was a very good deal - free flow champagne and wine and gin cocktails (huge choice of gins) and martinis. A lovely thing to do on a Sunday lunchtime in Singapore
4
The set lunch was slightly disappointing. Starters were really small - the miso soup was a normal miso soup, smoked salmon only had 2 slices and the menu indicated egg but there were only little bits of hard boiled egg arnd the plate, not even half an egg. Mains were great tho. Portion was huge and satisfying. Service was rather slow as the restaurant is big and we were seated in a corner. Dark ambience great for taking food photos but not so good for group shots or selfies.
5
The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Grand Hyatt hotel. We had a group business dinner in the wine room, which is an experience in itself. You are sitting next to all of the first growth Bordeaux (Margaux, Latour, Lafite, Mouton Rothschild), lots of second growth, also DRC, Gaja and more - truly creates a special mood for the wine lovers. We had dinner family style - excellent crab cakes, chicken wings, a couple of salads, followed by steak, pan-fried chicken and salmon with French fries, Brussels sprouts and a few other side dishes. Dessert included a number of different sorbet, ice creams and more.Excellent service, both dinner, and wine.I definitely recommend the restaurant, but probably having an expense account would be a significant plus.
5
We went for their set lunch and really enjoyed it. The ambience, personal attention from the wait staff, speed of service, helpful recommendation and overall affordability make this 5 stars. We had the 3 course set of sashimi salad, grilled steak and fires, and the flower pot for dessert. Plus a cup of mocha to finish it off. Everything was good. If there's one negative, it's that the piece of steak was really small. I estimate 100g or less. Nonetheless, I plan to go again
5
Went for a free-flow Oysters and Sancerre night in the Cocktail lounge. The wine glasses were never empty, and the oysters were fresh and delicious. There was also a good selection of meats and cheeses. We finished with some gin cocktails which were heavenly.Live DJ was a nice touch, although the music was a bit too loud.We'd been before and found that the service could be a bit spotty when busy, but this time everything was on point. Will go again for sure
5
Mezz9 is most suited for small group looking for fine dining. Ambience is excellent and food is really great. Customer service is very although food could come in a bit slow
5
Very posh setting. The international buffet brunch is pricey but well worth it. No skimping on quality here. It is more worth it if you like your brunch with some alcohol...free flow! However, you do need to walk over to the separate gin bars, and martini bars. Champagne is poured by the server.

Great place to celebrate friends & family's birthdays!!!! with yummiest Singapore favorite food & desserts!

Our family took a lunch there today. The food is nice and there is a wide array of selection. We were served by Kelvin and we found him very professional. He patiently explained what we were entitled to and gave suggestions to perfect our dinning experience.The lunch is not costly as we have Hyatt Dinning Card. The only setback is that it is always fully booked and hence one should book to avoid any disappointment.I highly recommend this restaurant to all who want a good environment and is serious about a good Dinning experience
4
Restaurant with wide variety of different cuisines. Chinese Japanese western Thai , definitely something for everyone
5
Mezz9 is a place where good memories of mine were made, my birthday, New Year and meeting friends here is just perfect. Although the service has slacked lately food standards ambiance and decoration have always been kept high. Thank you Mezza

Great quality food and ambience. As usual, the lamb chops are really good and always never fails to hit the spot! Great service and ambience makes it even better

Our family of 4 brunched at the Fullerton on 25Dec and at M9 on 31 Dec and the following notes compare them.Meet and greet: both very good and professional.Table spacing: Fullerton was cramped without intimacyService staff: both very good but M9 were more willing to engage and make recommendations. M9 seemed better trained and more professional.Ambience: M9 wins this by a Long shot. Fullerton lacked making us feel special and that we were accepted as welcome guests who had paid a lot of money. Number of diners: Fullerton packed them in and there were far to many making it an ordeal to access serving stationsServing stations: M9 has them better spaced and better presented. Fullerton was a bit canteen styleSeafood selection: M9 has oysters Fullerton doesn’t. Fullerton shell fish poorly cooked and inedible. Fullerton serve whole Salmon M9 doesn’t Sushi section: both good but Fullerton drops the ball by having too many guests and too little space at the serving areaRoasts: both good but M9 had tastier beefBBQ: Only Fullerton had BBQ station which wasn’t greatSalads: Fullerton much better Desserts: both very goodCheeses: both very goodI don’t know what’s going wrong with the Fullerton as for a Long time I have thought it the best in town but it’s lost it’s sparkle. Management need to take note of customer satisfaction levels and do something to improve them and retain customers support. We knew another group of 6 pax at the Fullerton brunch and they said value for money was poor, it was overcrowded and of course there were no oysters.Would I go back:Fullerton: we spent a lot of money and came away very disappointed M9: yes I would go bac

Great service rendered by staff every time I dines there! Just love the ambience & food. Really a good place to chill & dine. Highly recommended
5
Loved the food, ambience and service. It’s better than The Town @Fullerton. We were so impressed that we signed up for the membership too.
3
Restaurant was very disorganized, overall. Food was average, but service was poor. Would not visit again.
5
Food was splendid, they didnt just focus on the champagne. Their reds were good too. The service was impeccable. I lost my phone and thanks to the service staff, I was able to get my phone back.
5
Went for my wife's birthday with the family. Fantastic meal and excellent service. Special mention to Sam who made the whole experience first class. Thoroughly recommended
5
First thing to note was that the service was impeccable. The staff were attentive to details and genuinely cares about the diners. One person to compliment is definitely Dushku. She had merely asked if we were celebrating an occasion before arranging a whole entourage and a delicious dark chocolate cake for me and my guest. Food was wonderful as well, Had the oysters, White Truffle Risotto, Maine Lobster Noodles and crab cakes. None of the dishes disappoint whether in terms of plating or taste. Definitely a place to return to with your loved ones. It's easy to find good food these days, but it's almost impossible to find such meticulous service these days.Kudos to Dushku once again and have fun guessing where she is from as well
5
We had our year end dinner here. Together with spouse and partner, there were about 50 of us. We could have a separate room so that we don’t disturb the rest of the restaurant with our speeches and laughters. Food and service was exceptional too
5
Dushku gave excellent lunch service to us 3 ladies. She offered a small & delightful birthday cake for my friend without us asking. She served with a smile & was attentive to our needs. She observed that we were singing a bd song for our friend & took the initiative to pleasantly surprise us with her warm gesture. She's truly an asset to your emterprise. 
5
Group of 15 used the private room following the Singapore Cup race day. Apart from great food and service they did not have any issues of us bringing our own wine in. Really we did not have to since there wine selection is fantastic and included a hard to find favourite basket press from Rockfords. Overall a fantastic night and dinner at Mezza

Mezza9 is, as the name suggests, on the mezzanine floor of the Grand Hyatt. It is a large, buzzing space with delicious fresh food. This was our third visit and it never disappoints. Wonderful friendly service provided by Dushku. The black pepper crab was fabulous. You will have a great night here
4
quality sustainable meats & seafood, simply grilled. there's a selection of Asian dishes but the value is with the meats
2
As a Club at Hyatt member, I dine at Mezza 9 on a very regular basis. The menu doesn't change and the standard is low. The service is average. The wait staff are patient, friendly and polite but that's about it. Some of the food takes very long to arrive, and knowing their slow service, I always ask for my dessert, coffee and bill to be prepared half way into my main course, but after finishing my main, I would still have to wait super long for my desert, coffee and bill. What's the point of requesting for all these earlier? I notice they treat their "rich old regulars" better as I happened to be surrounded by a few tables of such regulars on my last visit
5
I went to Mezza 9 for a fantastic birthday dinner for one of my friends. We all had the 79$ set menu, and it included an appetizer, a main course, dessert, and coffee/ tea. The menu was quite diverse and all courses where delicious. I highly recommend this for those who want a classy, fun dining experience. In addition, please note that Mezza9 has a great price for set menus compared to many other fine dining restaurants. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I will be coming back again

Ambience is fantastic . It’s a romantic atmosphere . Cosy & Classy really . Service is good . Charming Bartenders , very friendly . Bar Manager Diaz was an absolute darling . The martinis are out of this world .Must Try :Coconut & Passion martini Iron Balls & 4 Pillars Shiraz Thai Chicken Wings I’ll definitely be back . See you again Rockstars . You nailed it EVERY SINGLE TIME . Love,Mika
5
Great Service provided by the staff! Would like to take this chance to compliment Loges, who never fails to provide us with a personalized service unlike anywhere else! Celebrated our birthday here and we got ourselves a complimentary magic show by StefaneBinger! Impressed by the service and initiative shown ☺
5
This was a birthday lunch for my friend. I have placed in my Chope booking remarks for a bd cake and song for my friend. The restaurant was busy when we visited. I made a similar request with the staff and this was attended to immediately. Awesome experience at Mezza9
1
Instead of double boiled chicken soup, minced chicken soup was offered as choice for Chinese soup. It was starchy and salty - no standard. The main dish - pock ribs Cantonese style and tiger prawns were so so, nothing to shout about. Service standard was extremely lousy. Have to try very hard and make numerous attempts to catch attention of waiter and waitress. Some acknowledged the call but never come to the table. Request for top up of condiment was not attended to after more than 30 mins and we had to hail another waiter who served the condiment pretty promptly..thank goodness!Ordered ice cream for dessert.. the tea came but no ice cream was served after long wait. Finished our tea and asked for the bill (we decided to forget about the ice cream) ...had to wait VERY lonnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggggg for the bill ....what a shame! The familiar faces I see no more and the good service also no more.. My guest said it would be her first and LAST time at this restaurant :

As a frequent patron to the bars and restaurants at The Grand Hyatt Hotel, I was excited about this deal for 2 reasons: 1) I love gin; 2) the food is always so lovely; and 3) Mezza 9 is a great bar.Upon receiving a Chope deal in conjunction with The Grand Hyatt show-casing their new ‘Party room’ at Mezza 9, I quickly gathered some friends who had never been before to enjoy the deal: $88++ for a Chope exclusive menu full of their signature snacks as well as free-flow martinis, gin & tonics and house pours.Upon arriving we were shown to our table and promptly ignored. Because my friends and I were busy catching up we hadn’t noticed we’d been neglected for some time (around 30mins). We finally managed to flag down a passing waiter who then informed us we could not take part in the deal unless we paid first. This all seemed very odd but we went with it. Payment seemed to take forever and in the meantime, the 3hr deal (from 7-10pm) was ticking away and we were yet to receive any food or drink. Eventually we received out drinks but the food was slow. Then without being informed, one of the vegetarian dishes was replaced by a meat dish – which simply didn’t work for us. We asked to speak with the manager and were once again promptly ignored. In the end one of our party went in search of the manager – who listened to our feedback and took it onboard. He then stayed with us for a little while – during which, the service from the waiting staff improved considerably. Unfortunately, when he left for the evening so did the service.Mezza 9 has the opportunity to make the most of this great deal but I felt the service let them down. If the service can be improved they are onto a winner. Thanks Daniel for taking our feedback onboard
5
we go there about twice a year, usually on an invitation.The selection at Mezza9 is amazing. The fact that they manage to do everything to perfection is mind boggling. Leave it to an Austrian Chef de Cuisine

This restaurant has a very extensive menu and you will be able to find something to suit everyone. I've eaten here several times and it never disappoints. Great option if you don't want to head out of the hotel.

I have eaten dinner and Sunday brunch here numerous times over the years whenever I have visited Singaporean and always loved it.Unfortunately I think this is the last time I will bother.I had dinner here tonight with my mother. We are staying in the hotel.The service was non existent.We had to wait forever for a waiter to arrive at our table to even pour a glass of water who then gruffly asked if we we ready to order.I asked if they had a wine list as none had been offered. Did I want a glass or a bottle? Well, did that really matter, I asked for a wine list. I wanted to order a bottle so a wine list was literally thrown on the table! He was extremely rude. Thankfully he didn’t bother to return to our table.After another long wait someone finally came and took our order for wine and food. At this stage we had been there for nearly 40 minutes.The meal and wine finally arrived.Wine was good, food very ordinary.I had to get up and pour our own wine as nobody showed up to top up our glasses.When we finished our meal and wine we sat for about 30 minutes waiting to be offered a desert menu or coffee.In the end I asked for the bill and we went elsewhere out of the hotel for desert and after dinner cocktails as none of this seemed to be going to be offered to us here.This is an expensive restaurant. I have had much better food and service in a cheap cafe.I have always loved this restaurant but never again
4
Wife planned birthday dinner there. Service staff was friendly and attentive. Was attended by Sam, a chirpy and responsive staff.Food was good although last time was better but it was more a matter of choice than the restaurant's fault. The garouper was especially delicious.Was about to order dessert when Sam&company brought a small and yummy chocolate cake with a single candle.Was an enjoyable evening. Thank you Mezza9 and Sam
5
At Mezza9 you can have all kinds of food combined in the same place. Good for families, couples or business, the area is divided in a way that can cater for any taste.
5
Great food, great service, great ambience! Must compliment Kevin for his great attentiveness to customers.
3
Had a business dinner here in a private room. The selection of food is very broad but none of it amazing. The steaks tasted more boiled than cooked. They were not overdone but had no crust and only a very light colouring on the outside. Service was ok but lacked a bit of attention at times.
4
We had dinner here on Saturday of the GP week end and the place was very crowded. The food was good and the service was good too. My bruschetta starter was very tasty and I enjoyed it. I had to wait for a while from my British beef rib eye steak.Mr Razif who looked after our small group of 7 persons was very friendly and in a good mood. We enjoyed the dinner and will return ro the Mezza9 when we visit Singapore next time
4
Selection of seafood, sushi and meat is excellent. Oysters were fresh and delicious and desserts were surprisingly good too
5
Great food, good varierty, always a good place to go back to, awesome martini’s at martini bar before - a mus
5
Very nice restaurant to eat at if your staying as a guest or visitor to the hotel,very friendly staff, only complaint is the AC is very cool
5
A very special dining experience which offers a great variety of experiences in food and wine in an amazing setting, superbe food quality and service, I had an amazing time and highly recommend
3
Quite a large restaurant on the 2nd floor of the Grand Hyatt. It looks nice and modern. Food wise, it was a mixed bag. The crab cakes as a starter were nice. The mains were ok (stirfry beef was decent but overpriced) and the dessert (cheese platter and pancakes) was good. A negative note for service. We ordered a fresh apple juice which only arrived after the main course had been provided. Restaurant seems like it lacks staff to match its size
5
Had the set lunch with a friend and would recommend this place because of the quality of food and excellent service. Set lunch is $42+++ for a 3-course meal and there's a nice range of options. This is refreshing because many places usually offer a limited set lunch menu. You can choose from Japanese, Thai, Chinese and Western dishes. Mix and match as you wish! Thumbs up. Will definitely go again
5
I have been here numerous times, and twice for Xmas. The variety is astounding and the quality is consistently excellent. Expect to spend hours indulging and relaxing. It truly is an excellent dining experience. I’ve never been to a buffet with so much choice.For Xmas, it’s magical. There is a little choir, Santa comes around and gives gifts
5
Busy restaurant on the first floor of the Grand Hyatt. Amazing range of food types , all of the highest quality. You wont be disappointe
5
This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. From Thay to Sushi, from hamburger to raw Fish everything is good. Gold metal to the service, everyone is kind and smily. Grand Hyatt, where the resto is located is a beautiful hotel but this restaurant is a real surprise.
4
Food is tasty, great selection, nice ambiance, wonderful service. Kevin took great care of us and we particularly enjoyed the lamb cutlets. Held a birthday celebration and the servers sang an interesting and enjoyable rendition of "That's the way (I like it)" as a birthday song (instead of the usual boring 'Happy Birthday'). Overall, would come back again
4
Had my birthday celebration at Mezza9 and the service was excellent especially rendered by Kevin! He is attentive; polite and always smiling whenever we look for him.The food was good except that the prawn cocktail was slightly too hard. The rest of the courses were tasty.The birthday cake from Mezza9 and the hip birthday song was totally a big surprise for me. I will definitely go back for more meals
5
Just had an amazing Sunday Brunch at Mezzanine. I have lived in many places in Asia, but Mezzanine will always be my happy place. Today our waiter was Sam from the Philippines and he was excellent. He added so much to our enjoyment, I would really like to commend him to his management. We will be back - and hopefully, we will be able to meet Sam again
4
It's cozy and comfortable place. I went here for lunch and dinner. Mostly I like better here for having dinner.
2
I had dinner at Mezza9 and it was a poor experience. The concept is interesting but the execution is terrible. The food lacks taste and the service is a disaster (slow with poor coordination). Overall a below average experienc
5
Excellent service recovery from Diana and lunch service from Kevin. Appreciate the gesture to rectify the lapse. Kevin, thank you for the wonderful recommendation on steak n fries -was done perfectly Med rare - my daughter absolutely loved it. Thanks
5
Had a wonderful time being served by Ms Dushku. Service with a sweet smile and very helpful . Thank you mMs Dushk
4
High quality buffet with a decent variety. Overall most impressed with the foie gras pate, cold cuts, lobster and roast meats. It was unfortunate that the oysters seemingly ran out in the last hour of the brunch as they were excellent. Service staff were very attentive although nothing exceptional that day. The chefs were most friendly and the chef handling the dessert area was very helpful.The only area of the buffet which could be improved upon was dessert. The little tarts and pastries available were not impressive or very good for that matter but overall we felt that we did get value for what we paid for brunch although it is one of the more expensive non-alcoholic brunches at a hotel
5
Great food; attentive but discrete service. Lovely ambiance and many stations. Loved the cheese. Quite pricey but worth it
4
We were here to have a birthday celebration over food and drinks. Great variety - you've got almost every possible option from Asian to Western cuisine to please even the fussiest eater :) Kevin attended to us through the evening - great service in checking in through the course to make sure everything was ok. We even had the team sing us a very cool version of a standard birthday song. Portions served were a tad too big- so come here with a hungry tummy to really appreciate it
5
The restaurant never fail me in their service level and food quality. It is always a good experience to dine at this restaurant. Will keep coming back!
4
Very nice open concept dining on the 2nd level of Hyatt hotel,off Scotts road ; food is prepared before your very eyes. You see the chefs in tall white hats busy fixing your meal. A two or three course lunch meal is offered at half price for UOB visa infinite members with two dining together
5
My parents and I usually frequent various hotels for brunch buffets especially during birthdays. We dined at mezza9 on the 20th for their Sunday brunch and it's definitely one of the best we've had. The food was amazing, but what made it even better was the fantastic service that we had. We were served by Dushku and Leo, both were extremely exceptional in their service delivery and it made our birthday brunch an even more pleasant one. We will definitely be back for more
4
A group of 6 of us went for Sunday brunch on 20/8/17 and very grateful to Chef Yee Lee for arranging Yorkshire Puddings for this group of homesick brits. This level of service was unexpected at a buffet, but gratefully received. Also, the Nitrogen Gin infused Meringues, are worth going for alone
5
I have been going to Mezza9 for years. The quality of the food, products is fantastic.
You just cannot go wrong when you go there.
The plus is that you can have different type of cuisines : Western/Japanese/Chinse/Thai in the same place.
5
This was our third brunch in Mezza 9 at the Grand Hyatt, and after 3 great experiences i felt it was time to spread the word. The food was incredible and drinks were fabulous ... but the service was the best, with a big thanks to Ravichandran Rv and his wife Vanessa Aggabao Ravichandran. we will be back again
5
I think that the quality of food and service was 5/5 when I visited. Dining atmosphere was great as well.I want to give a special mention to one of the staff there that took very good care of me during my visit. I can't remember her name but I do remember that she told me she was from Mongolia. Be sure to look out for her! I'm sure she'll take good care of you during your visit as well
1
Restaurant was not even 50% filled when we walked in on Friday night 840 pmAt 1025 pm when we asked for bill n a cup of ice waterThe waiter walked away n told his college loudly why we still asked for water at this time, and wanted to tell us restaurant is closed . I understand last order is 1030 pmWe approached the manager in charge and he said he can understand his staff need to joke because they are tire and busy at earlier hours We are members of Club at the Hyatt for more than 24 years Very sad to witness this level of service .Grand hyatt singapore has gone downhill each n every year in every restaurant If asking for one glass of water is too much of effort...and manager agrees that staff should joke loudly to the ear of customers...Then Grand Hyatt singapore should rename back hyatt Singapore instead SIG
5
Six of us went for the Sunday brunch bonanza. We did the free flow thing for $140 and given that you're in one of the most expensive cities on the planet it was worth it. We started with champagne ( and it was a good one, none of your cheap stuff here) and we had about 3 glasses before we took on the buffet. Oysters lobster and prawns to start, then smoked meats, then Chinese duck, chicken and finished off with roast lamb. There's also beef etc. Nice Sauvignon Blanc and reds tooAll the food was top quality and the service very good. Can't quite remember leaving! Totally borrachoA great dining experience but if you're doing the free flow best to write the rest of the day off and get back to your scratcher for a kip. Loved it!
5
My wife and I went back to Mezza9 (where we ate the night we got married) after 19 years and it was amazing. The food was excellent, the service was amazing as was the wine selection
4
I am a regular at Mezz9. This time we had the set lunch, with crab cakes followed by steak&Fries. Crab cakes are pleasant, but I put some tabasco to give some kick to the remoulade sauce. The sirloin was good, cooked as we wanted, with nice fries and Bearnaise but the my guest's steak was a little too small. Mine was bigger. Hyatt serves good products in a set lunch at a net price of SGD38 so I can understand some rationing. This time Mr. Scrooge was too powerful in the kitchen, though.Good coffee
4
Was there with some friends for their 2-3 course lunch set (S$32-S$42 +++) on a Saturday. Each set comes with coffee/tea choices. There are quite a range of choices from Western to Asian. I had the seafood range which was good. It was a simple but quality meal. We ended our meal with 2 of us ordering desserts to share among our party of 4. Mezza9 Flower Pot was delightful not only to the palate but to the eyes as well. Very creative (see my photo). Ambience was quiet although there were customers around us. I found that the spotlight above me was like I was sitting on an airplane looking at the menu and enjoying my meal. A friend joked that it is first class seat.: ) Also, we loved the free flow serving of bread which was fantastic as it was fresh from oven judging by the warmth of the bread (not toasted). A full loaf was given which was awesome. They do sell them if one would like to buy as saw that breads were placed on the wall shelf for sale. As we stayed for quite long chit chatting away as it has been quite a long time we have not seen one another, we were served by a few different waiting staff. Majority were excellent except one or two who could be distracted and not focusing on giving good service according to my friends. I look forward to good promotion in future so that we could go back again
2
Was there to celebrate my Son and hubby's birthdays. We ordered the meat and seafood platters. Never asked how we want our meat to be cooked. The BBQ lobster was stale and tough. The piece of white fish was dry and not edible. The sausages tasted bad. Overall was a bad experience. We used to be HYATT members so we practically patronise all the restaurants quite often so we were greatly disappointed that the service and food standards have deteriorated so much.
5
Weekday lunch at mezza9, chose the 3 course lunch set at 42 SGD++. The crabcake starter was delicious and so were the chirashi don and flower pot dessert
1
Let's start with the good. I feel that Mezza9 usually delivers in terms of the quality of its food which is good enough a reason for me to visit. While I was disappointed with their seating arrangements last time, I let it pass only to be extremely disappointed yet again. Despite informing them that I would be celebrating a birthday and requesting for a quiet table I was told that there was no guarantee but that they would try. Good enough for me. However, I was not happy that they proceeded to sit me in the same area I was unhappy with the last time. When I enquired about some tables they said that the tables were specifically requested by some customers and I needed to know the table numbers. My questions to management are as follows:1) Why can't you guarantee me a decent table when I made the request but could accede to some customers request for specific tables? 2) Now that I've the table numbers can management guarantee that I can get them if they are not booked in advance? (I've many numbers to choose from :))3) Is table allocation based on how regular you are / if you are a hotel guest or foreign? 4) If the management cannot guarantee point 2) then did your staff misrepresent your establishment? I certainly expect better from Mezza9. Mostly I find your staff wonderful and the food decent. But this is certainly very sad for the restaurant.

Had lunch at mezza9 on 22/07/17, As usual, I ordered steamed crab with egg white and a plate of mixed vegetables. A while later, a waitress came over to inform me that steamed crab with egg white will cost an extra $20. Told her that 2 weeks ago I ordered the same dish without having to pay extra money. I am not against paying for the egg white but to charge $20 is ridiculous.However, I would like to commend Mr Razif for his good service rendered to all diners. He was patient, pleasant and helpful. Besides, he also painstakingly explained to me about the extra charge.No complain about the service standard but disappointed with the extra charge

This is a fine place for business, family gathering and couples. They will indulge you with their menus and wide range of wines! I tried their 17 years oldWine- it was fantastic! FYI: They have special room for smokers! And you can burn all the calories after by dancing at Brix ( don't wear too sexy dresses though! enter at your own risk ladies )

Hyatt, well known for quality food. We ordered Khao Moo Yang, BBQ pork collar Thai style. Was too sweet, overwhelm the BBQ taste. We preferred to have a little charred. The crispy noodle with Maine Lobster was not bad, but can't say that's excellent. Tenderloin steak was medium to well down, where I ordered medium to medium rare. Good selection of wine. Restaurant was quite good on Friday and by 7:30PM, the restaurant become unpleasant with the smell of cooking.
5
My friends and I had an amazing Sunday Brunch thanks to Daniel and the rest of the Mezza9 team. Daniel's service was beyond expectation. He anticipated our needs and fulfilled even our unexpressed wishes. Loved the coconut and espresso martinis. It was a memorable dining experience. Will definitely be back whenever I'm in Singapore.
4
We visited on a Saturday afternoon. Making reservations on the Chope app on Saturday morning was a breeze. We ordered the deep fried soon hock and fried rice. Our credit card entitled to a 50% discount on the meal for two so we had a fantastic bargain. Definitely worth a return visit
2
The main advantage of this place, which has a vibrant atmosphere, is if people in your party have different culinary preferences, they would probably find what they want here. Otherwise, the food is not as good as what you would find at the equivalent specialist restaurant - whether it is grill, sushi, Thai, Chinese, etc. Service keeps deteriorating; at our last visit, it was downright horrific: One waiter spilled hot water and did not clean the table until requested to do so; another waiter dropped a whole bowl of boiling soup and only provided ice cubes for our guest to cool herself when asked; drinks (iced tea, Diet Coke) came after 20 minutes, a glass of wine never came (in spite of a volunteered promise that it would be free)!! The table was left uncleaned for a long time. At the premium price charged, customers deserve better.
5
Good quality food, good ambience. The cod fish served was abit too hard for the day. Otherwise , everything's good. The plus point is the credit card promo that makes the value of meal even more attractive.

Every Sunday you can enjoy watching 9 live cooking stations prepare delicious food from all over the world. An ideal place for celebrating birthdays and wedding days, with or without champagne. Reservations are highly recommended as this place is often crowded with people. Seafood (sushi, sashimi, lovster, crab) was fresh, meat (char siew, roast duck, chicken satay) was juicy and fruits (strawberries, cherries, melons) were sticky sweet. Orange juice is freshly squeezed and TWG tea is free-flow as well. Unfortunately, despite their irresistible look, the pastries were quiet a let-down. For 128 SGD (includ. tax) I had also hoped for a larger selection of juices and smoothies (one type is clearly not enough). Plus, water tasted like tap water. Apart from these shortcomings, the buffet was a memorable experience
5
Eating marathon for 3.5 hours. Pace yourself. It's got many buffets- Japanese and Chinese food and western food and a dessert spread with fruit. You can book to have free flow alcohol or not. Delicious foo
4
We went there for lunch. It was incredibly busy so make a reservation if you can. The lunch menus were served quickly and food was Ok
5
Lunch set is highly recommended. Plus a very good service by staffs (especially Mr Kevin), I am a regular customer over there and never get tired of it. hope they continue to do good job
5
A very trendy bar within Mezza 9 . The Bar Manager , Diaz was cool and very knowledgeable with his products . His Team was friendly , showcasing high-quality service even when the bar was busy . Combined with some very creative drinks and a menu of tasty accompaniments. "Apple Truffle & Gummy Bear Martini " was simply FABULOUS ! The music is super and fits in perfectly. A very nice place to start or end the night
5
This place is consistent in the quality of food offered however the service was fantastic when compared to the rest of the five star hotels around Orchard. Me and my friend was so impressed by the excellent service offered to us from the moment we entered the restaurant till we leave. ( Especially when we walked out from Cross Roads Cafe at Marriott Hotel.) Hostess Supervisor ( Indian Lady) was quick & polite..Dushku & Verina did a fantastic job, efficient,fun,caring,discreet and fast. A real treat to be served by hospitality Professionals ( Finally). Dushku, Verina you guys are superstar and Congrats Mezza9 ( dream) Team
3
Food was ok except the sashimi veg which was too bitter. Manager just brushed it off. It was my wedding anniversary which was stated in the Chope reservations but they gave me a birthday cake and sang me a birthday song!

During our recent trip to Singapore, we went to Mezza9 for their Sunday champagne brunch. The restaurant is listed (on "thebestsingapore" website) as one of the top 5 places for champagne brunch in Singapore. We decided to chose Mezza9 from the recommended list - for the type of champagne they serve (Perrier-Jouët) and the great variety of buffet food (European & Asian). It was a good choice - excellent food, good service and fabulous champagne. The restaurant offers 3 types of champagne from the house of Perrier-Jouët : the Grand Brut, the Blason Rosé & the Belle Epoque 2007. A number of wines (white and red) as well as soft drinks were included in the price. We were happy to stay with our Blason Rosé & Belle Epoque - a wonderful relaxing brunch from 11:30am to 3:00pm. Highly recommended!Tip : ask for a table (in bar area) furthest from the food stations for less noise
4
This stylish sprawling brasserie has a wide menu ranging from grilled items to Japanese and Thai food. There is a nice buzz, and service is consistently excellentThe crab cakes was very good, as was the Tom Yam soup. Found the mixed grill slightly over cooked. Portions are large, so make sure you don't over orderNot cheap, but recommended
3
I like the martini here especially lychee martini. Food quality and presentation here seems to have dropped. Visited here twice this week for both lunch and dinner. Lunch service was good, staff and servers are friendly My dinner was served by another group of staff, is below the hotel usual standard. Forgot our drinks, keep dropping cutlery while serving etc.
5
Top marks for this restaurant for food , wine and service as it ticks all the boxes .Would recommend this restaurant as it was a delight to eat at.
3
Overall quality seems to be dipping somewhat.Had the set lunch with 5 colleagues and we all had different set lunches.Mine - the chirashi bowl was poor in qualityThe others had mixed reviews. Some were good. Some average.The flower pot dessert was good.Service was good though marred when the manager was berating our server for some issue right next to us about 2 metres away. A few vulgarities as well.Despite whatever he did, believe it should be handled in private and with professionalism.
5
Last Saturday (27/06/17) my friend and I went for lunch at Mezza9. We were attended to by your service staff, Mr Loges, who was very attentive. He made every effort to answer to our queries, and also checked with the chef whether our request can be accommodated.The food were good and we enjoyed it. Good food must come with good service. We would like to commend Mr Loges for his good service rendered. Besides, he was thoughtful to other diners too
5
I was there 2 weeks ago with my 2 other friends . First visit there and was blown away . We were seated in the bar . Nice and cozy for a sunday brunch get together.Mezza 9 serves superb quality food!!! What makes it an heightened experience dinning is the people working there. Lots of variety of dishes to choose from. Cook food and seafood are very fresh . The beverage offering is to die for . Worth the money . Special thanks to Bar Manager Diaz and his team for bringing smiles to our table of 3 . You gusy made our day! He recommended us the Basil Martini and it really compliment the food we were having . What surprise us was he spoke to us in our national language. Very well verse in Thai. We would definitely return :) Keep up the good work 
4
Had lunch at Hyatt Hotel's Mezza 9 restaurant; nice ambience, open concept; you see food being prepared at various stations. Set lunch was good with the new menu. We had halibut , pan fried on a bed of cooked vegetables. Good combination of healthy foods
5
This place is a large sensational concept but really comfortable restaurant which has found its way to other Grand Hyatt's including China. I suspect from the success of this one which I've been visiting for almost 20 years, it was undergoing even more multi-million dollar updates when we were there - they were creating a whole new Gin & Wine Bar. But the gem is pitching yourself at the famed Chinese seafood bar. These guys, many the same as from the earliest days are legends in prepping crabs, fish, abalone, etc. for someone's feast. But our favourite, and I have been here on every occasion I crossed through Singapore on business or pleasure (20+ times or more) has seen me front the Mezza9 Chinese bar. The head chef is a legend; understated but what a cook and he has always remembered and looked after us with great delivery. They do their Sri Lankan mud crabs three ways: Singapore Chilli, Black Pepper and White Pepper. The former is tasty and the last cranked up to optimum pain sensor threshold where the top of your skull just cascades with perpetration. Exquisite! If you can try it but if not the others will do you fine. As a regular mud crab eater in Australia, these are my absolute favourite. Great atmosphere, classy, and a real experience not to be missed. The meal in such great circumstances is about S$90.00 before drinks (thats another issue)
2
Regular visitor but. It since they changed the layout... felt terribly cramped as you go towards the Chinese roast section. So much so that at one point there seals a gap of less than 0.5 between the back of a chair and the serving station... you had for someone to serve themselves and move to get past.... so after a quick look at that end of the restaurant did not try barging past again....
5
I had my meals there three times. Always ordering different things and loving it. I did not feel like going anywhere for my meals. The food was fresh and tasty. Staff polite efficient and warm. I did not have sweets but they looked very inviting and if you are chocoholic, watch out! Ravi and Jaya are delightful.Thank you Mezze9
3
We went here for dinner one night, I heard they served the famous Singapore chilli crab (sadly not), so went over. Has a strict dress code, slightly stiff wait staff, found them a bit smug, the food and service was so so, we had sushi ( 3 on 5), crab cakes (2 on 5), Tom Yum (2 on 5), the place was packed, nothing memorable though, but the Straits Kitchen, man, that was somethin
4
Highly popular restaurant with a well regarded Chinese kitchen.We skipped the Chinese food for other options.The Wagyu steaks were great. The Brown Crab Salad was over-dressed, and The White Asparagus with Hollandaise was good; slightly bitter but acceptable
4
Great food and atmosphere. Had a late dinner with the group here following the horse race. The service was superb and put up with the group even though a few of us had a few drink
5
This post is dedicated to mah big man Kevin. This man and I shared some unforgettable moments about meat. You see with meat comes memories of good long tradition and expertise in fine cooking. The mezza9 lacked good memorable service last year but has exceeded my expectations tonight. I hope my good friend Kevin serves us in the near future. Please feel confident to come and dine at this elegant and lively restaurant for taste and memory you will never forget. Kind Regards,The other Kevin
5
So you want to try a hotel brunch. A fancy one. One that goes the extra mile, feels special. Search no more! This brunch has it all: buckets of lobster claws! miles of sushi! frozen-nitrogen desserts! free-flow champagne -- the good stuff! The only thing it lacks is atmosphere -- the interior space has no view. But who needs a view when you're busy scoping out the buffet
5
Had the experience of Sunday Brunch at Meeza9 situated at the Grand Hyatt10 Scotts road Singapore.was one of the best packages I have ever been to 3.5 hours of food and wine heaven, would recommend it to any one wanting a leisurely Sunday in Sinapor
4
I took the long hike to meet friends here having started off at the Martini Bar for happy hour drinks first. The food was delicious and much needed to soak up the preceding wine and cocktails. I was surprised at how expensive the oysters were, but this is Singapore after all. Food was faultless and on cue. The salmon and greens were cooked to perfection. I loved the open-planned kitchen and of course, the Penfolds wine display! I think I tried some wine too, though this was nudging me closer to my threshold for the night. Dessert was gorgeous and I left well and truly filled and sated.
4
We have gone many times over the years. One of our go to places to celebrate family events and times. The food is high quality and the service consistently good. There is little constructive feedback. Maybe only that the variety of food seems smaller than in the past. But not a major issue. Ambience is excellent. I would have rated it a five but think there should be a high standard and they should continue to strive for better and not be complacent.
5
A place with quiet and nice ambient. Suitable for meeting with client and customer. We were their after a long of work. We ordered lobster Bisque, Corona and some dessert. All are nice! They have customized lunch and dinner set you may try it out! A great place to chill!
4
Has dined in Mezza 9 many times , food are always good , its a safe place to entertained as they offer good varieties. 1 went to the Sunday champagne brunch today and it was how i remembered. As a regular patron, i feel its time they update the restaurant or menu.. seems boring after a while.its good but loss the Great and Wow factor
4
Dinner was excellent with good and friendly service, quality of food excellent. Australian fillet steak was perfectly cooked at medium rare. Highly recommended
5
Very popular place for lunch with numerous lunch set options. Remember to call ahead for reservations. I'm glad that I took my favourite bento box option again.
5
I had a wonderful evening sitting by the Western kitchen overseeing the chefs in action. All staff were friendly and made me feel at home. I would like to particularly commend and mention Chef Andre and Ellen who attended to me. Keep it up and I would strongly recomment this place to everyone
3
There were four of us and only 3 of us gotten the food. It took almost 15 mins for the last person's order to come. And ironically, he ordered sushi which requires almost no cooking! The waiter claimed that they have given his sushi to a wrong table. This is really inexcusable for such an establishment in a 5-star hotel. We were disappointed least to say.
4
If you are a hyatt member eating at any of their f n b establishments becomes really affordable. Had a crab meal (chilli crab & black pepper crab) and both were splendid. Much better than the seafood restaurants out there.Service was very good and always attentive.
4
Good place for a lunch amongst friend or for casual business. Set menu are affordable and offer enough food.
4
Comfortable for the food that we ordered. The service level provided by the F&B staff are great and always wear a smile on their face. They even have given us a surprise bday cake which I've called in earlier to enquire for something else.
4
mezza9 is a tried and trusted old favourite that we have been visiting for special occasions over at least the past decade. i usually don't like restaurants that offer different cuisines but in mezza9 everything is delish and bona fide so it works well when diners in the same party feel like different meals. we were there recently and some amongst us ordered sashimi, another ordered lobster noodles, and another steak. all brilliant. my order was the humblest and nothing to write home about - prawn cocktail with marie rose sauce that wasn't really a marie rose but i was told it was mezza9's twist on marie rose (didn't say in the menu) and the prawns were shelled but not cleaned so gritty (yuk); baby endives that turned out to be the humble baby kailan; and crab fried rice (as good or bad as a fried rice gets). but that was my problem - the steaks were melt-in-your-mouth, cooked just right; sashimi was super fresh and well presented; and the lobster noodles orderer licked the platter clean. so mezza9 gets a thumbs up from our family again. i'm glad we went after what felt like too long. and we will certainly go back in the near future i hope
4
Went there in March and was amazed with so many different cuisine in one restaurant. There are the Chinese, western, Japanese, Thai, etc. Tried the steak and it was really good. The waitresses were very attentive to our needs and served us promptly for what we asked. The ambience is very pleasant and we really enjoyed the surroundings. My niece ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice and its quite sour and the waitress is willing to change it. The service is superb. Will try to go down again to try other cuisine
5
While in Singapore we ate at Mezza 9, I have eaten here before the food is always fantastic. It did not disappoint I had the mud crab cooked chile style it was excellent. What I like about this restaurant its extensive menu means there is something there for all tastes. Our server Charles who had recently relocated from Switzerland was delightful. I often forget that this restaurant is located in the Hyatt you will too
4
Good dining experience of wide spread menu and quality good. Excellent customer service. Nice ambience for catching up with friends.The only issue is the complimentary car park which is not auto-given even as member
5
The set lunch is the best . There are 4 choices for each cost and comes with coffee or tea. Definitely value for money. Food was very well prepared and cooked
5
This is a wonderful place to eat that serves excellent food in a very pleasant atmosphere. There is an extensive menu of all kinds of dishes and having been here multiple times, I've never been disappointed. The one misgiving is that the service is uneven. On one hand there are truly wonderful servers who are effective, friendly and professional. Then there appear to be interns who lack a sense of alacrity and service-oriented self-presentation. But this does not stop me from returning here and is something easily corrected
5
Staff are very attentive and patient and also friendly. Menu selection is excellent and food portion is big. Worth coming to dine for all occasion. They even have a group of service staff come together to sing you a birthday song
4
Casual Dining in a library-like atmosphere. People use this area for catching up on e-mails and small business groups as well as for casual dining.
5
We were served by Lee and he was very attentive and pleasant. Good service makes a good dining experience.
4
The food is tasty and well presented. However, the service is not up to mark. First, the waiter tried to rush through the starters and when we told them to slow down, they completely forgotten about the main courses till we asked them about it. We thought it was rather unprofessional.
5
Varieties of Raw Fish and Seafood makes the whole lunch more sumptuous and appetizing. Miso soup served was very authentic.Service of the staff deserves a good pat on their shoulders as they always put customers at their hearts when they served
5
We were here for lunch, had the kids set (burger), 2 course fish, sashimi lunch and the lobster set lunch. Place was very busy, but staff were so attentive. Had made requests like no cheese for my son's burger, changed my noodles to hor-fun, and everything was done to perfection. Food was awesome!
4
Had lunch with a friend @ Mezza9 yesterday. The service staff who served around the pastry area were Mr Sam and Mr Lee. They both served with a smile and always made efforts to ensure that every diner was satisfied with the food. Besides, they were attentive to the needs of the diners.Food-wise, the new menu is quite refreshing. Just hope that the chef will bring back the steamed tiger prawns with egg white. Really missed this dish.A.S

Due to the setup of our business we are traveling between Copenhagen & Auckland twice every year, always with a pit stop in Singapore & always at the Grand Hyatt. Here is placed our favorite restaurant & bar (mezza9) of the parts of the World which we travel. Full stars for the kitchens (there are several of open kitchens in the mezza9), for the variety of the delicious international fusion dishes, for the plentiful, hardworking, efficient & extremely friendly staff, full stars for the awesome, lively bar with it's super skilled staff that in no time produces cocktails of any imaginable sort or provide appetizing bar meals. Alone watching the bartenders working is one of our favorite pastimes when we are staying there. In short: Grand Hyatt Singapore with mezza9 & it's bar is the unchallenged highlight of our traveling around the Globe
5
Booking from the website is easy and requested for a quiet corner as I know its quite busy night on Friday. The ambiance was nice and quiet as we are at a corner. We ordered a 3 course dinner. The price tag was on the high side, but was compensated by the quality and taste of the food. The steak was nicely done, very tender and juicy. Last but not least, the attentiveness of the servers were great. Razif and the other lady server was attentive thru out. Notice the little things that we need, and offer without us asking
5
Brought my brother-in-law for lunch @Mezza9 today. It was a 1st for him but I have been a regular guest. We tried the Thai / Chinese set menus and taste was good. Jessica / Kevin were attentive to our needs and my BIL was impressed with the excellent service provided. Visits to Mezza9 never fail to be a pleasant dining experience to the team. Kudos!!
4
Had dinner here on an impromptu decision. Very glad we did.Nice to give us a table despite the busy set-up. After so many years, the place still buzzes and delivers quality.Reliable, fuss-free, well-executed comfort food.A shout out to Razif for his efficient and jovial hospitality. Will come again.
5
Very nice environment, entertaining and lots of variety of cuisines. Very good quality food and service
4
We went there for 3 course lunch set. Good for value and they provide a quite number of selections. :)
3
After not visiting for a while we decided to go for dinner. Oyster were fresh but sashimi and steamed fish not so. The service was not very attentive in spite of some good efforts of 1 or 2 of the staff. Overall food quality remain open for improvement of freshness. Not bad but not what you expect from a restaurant like mezza
5
I frequent Mezza9 at least twice a week. Whether I have dinner, dinner and drinks, etc., I'm always impressed. The customer service is remarkable. They remember my wife and I by name. They also remember our drinks and choices of food. The food has always been perfectly prepared and presented on time. Anita, Gireer, Sebastian, Rosanna, and others, are models of customer service. Outstanding place.
4
We went for the Sunday brunch which included free flow champagne and Bloody Mary cocktails. The food choice was pretty good but as always with buffets some things look better than they taste. There was a fairly good selection and food seemed to be of a good quality. The ambience was dark and cosy, the staff attentive, for an occasional treat or a special occasion, it is highly recommended
2
With the good quality of food and the great spread you offer for the brunch but the service is much to be desire.Imagine convincing a friend to go Mezza9 instead of Ritz Carlton for brunch and yet getting dissapointed. I shall say I felt ashamed. I felt that the service way out of the exceptable zone.How hard could it be to be greeted sincerely at the door?what does it takes to get attention of the staffs that are more attentive to a particular table? Are they paying more? Are they regular? Are they VIPs? Or maybe I'm just too nice to be given the attention. Yes, we are talking about staff(s) from the service to the manager and even the chef are all over the table. I suddenly felt left out and zero existance.It all just went wrong from there on. Nobody even ask if they could clear away the table. It feels like a robot came to your table and just swipe away the plates and go. Nobody ask if everything is ok. Nobody tell us what is included in the package. And the most basic "Smile" it was missing. But i see full of it on that table.Should I feel wonderful, amaze and great? I felt terrible. Even the great food unable to console me. Overall, I just need basic service from the staff and being treated equally. I don't see that as too much to ask for. I feel like I'm paying full price to get a half price service. I hope the manager can walk the talk and set an example for the junior. At the moment definitely not going to come back or intro to anyone of this place
5
I stopped by Mezza9 for lunch yesterday. I ordered the two-course lunch special and had a crab cake for my starter and gai yang for my main accompanied by a glass of rose. The crab cake was served with a remoulade; I really enjoyed it. The gai yang was very generous; plenty of pieces of spicy chicken, dipping sauces and sticky rice. Not sure what I was supposed to do with the stand-up pot with a lettuce leaf, two pieces of celery. Garnish? It was tasty and filling. I thought this meal provided good value. The service was polite and efficient.On a separate occasion, we dropped in for a delicious coconut martini at the bar in the afternoon; it was freezing cold. Bring a jacket if it's going to be the middle of the day and the restaurant is going to be empty
5
This restaurant does give you choices from various regions. We had had a lot of Asian food and so welcomed the idea of Steaks/meat. The Sample meat platter for two coudl feed 4. Meats were grilled to taste, just perfect, and we also had the Thai Roast chicken, which was tasty too. The roasted Brussel sprouts and asparagus were a perfect complement. The cobb salad, while tasty, was a share portion for about 2 as a starter. Wines were good and staff did not hesitate to get us extra bread (delicious) and the Thai sauce as needed.
5
This was a highlight of our stay in Singapore, a must do if you get the chance. Foods from all around the world, being cooked by many chefs as you wander round taking your pick of all that's on offer, and champagne or wine etc. topped up constantly
2
The brunch spread was excellent. Seafood was fresh and good. Service was not attentive, wasn't expect this from 5star hotel like Grand Hyatt. So disappointed service, not friendly at all. Not sure will be back in future or not.
5
Many different cuisines, all very good quality. Good for big group who want to try different cuisines
5
Ate dinner on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was at three quarters capacity. Sat at the sushi bar seats and had a nice view of some of the food preparation. Service was excellent and the meal equally pleasant. I had the three course set for 78 SGD. Maine lobster bisque, beef filet, and chocolate/caramel pudding for dessert. Also had the bruschetta to start. With myriad food choices in Singapore it's hard to single out this place above all else, but the location is right and the flavors were delicious. Not overly expensive (for Singapore standards). Not one complaint - I'll be back
4
I've been staying at the Hyatt the past few years and find the food at Mezza9 really excellent. The menu changes so you have an opportunity to try different foods. I had the Lamb chops and stir fried vegetables recently and it was excellent. It is a pricey restaraunt but worth it. Service could be a bit more attentive. Wasn't impressed with that aspect the last two meals
4
We order the special 3 Martinis and asked to replace one that was not good at all. Finally, after a bit of argumentation we were nicely offered a replacement one by Dena. Thank yo
4
nice place ..........had lunch on new years eve. we ordered the lunch tray. my wife steamed fish and i ordered grilled salmon. both excellent. our kids ordered pork steak which was tough. service ok
4
My local friend and I had dinner here tonight (29th Dec) to celebrate New Year a few days early - we couldn't have it on the 31st due to other commitments.As indicated by the name, Mezza9 is on the Mezzanine floor of the Grand Hyatt Singapore in Scotts Rd - it has a large menu with different cuisines - Japanese, Thai, Seafood, Western and Chinese. There is an extensive wine display - plenty of choices.The restaurant is open planned with four or five food preparation stations - it is interesting watching orders being prepared - lots of activity.We shared the Sashimi, Sushi and Sushi roll platter - not a bad for starters, then we each had the Australian Angus beef tenderloin plus potato's, asparagus and beans on the side plus sauces.A good meal at a nice restaurant - prices reflect the reputation - service was fine and the staff attentive and helpful.I think dining a few days early than New Year's Eve was a winner as it wasn't crowded which made it a pleasant meal
3
Really disappointed with both the food and service. My lobster noodles was tasteless and no amount of chilli and soy sauce was able to savage it. The turkey ordered by my husband did not come with enough sauce. Our appetitizer of crab cakes was over fried. The service it self lack attention and our wine list was removed from our table without asking whether we needed it.
5
Wow ...Probably the best brunch I've been to!Family loved it..Oysters , good meats !Wine / champagne all day
4
At S$148 ++ per person this is hardly the best value for money proposition in town, but its absolutely worth going to Mezza 9 at least once. People watching as the enjoyment kicks in of the unlimited and frequently topped up Perrier champagne is entertaining enough on its own. On the food side the seafood selection is the highlight, and this is definitely a venue suitable for a large group wanting to having a fun afternoon- just don't rush it. Plan to start at 11.30, be there for at least 3 hours and take a taxi home
5
We booked a private room for a business meeting at lunch... Nice service - efficient & leaving us alone with our conversations yet always attentive. The food was really delicious - the variety - including customisable vegetarian / healthy was served in business-friendly sets. Topped up with good quality coffee/cappuccino. Would highly recommend for weekday business lunches !
2
We went there in December where its probably more lively than normal, its was fine with us by the way. There is a lot of different dishes from many different places so variation is just fine. The quality of the food is for sure not good enough for a Hyatt Hotel and especially not taking into consideration the price you pay for it.I do not mind the lively atmosphere but i do mind too low quality of foo
2
Did not care for my one visit to this restaurant. It was the weekend and you are forced into their expensive $60 a head buffet. I would be fine with the fee if the food quality, variety and availability (many things went unreplenished) were in keeping with a $60 a head amount. They were not
4
Good quality food of different origin. One can find seafood, meats, vegetarian dishes, pastas... Service is good but one need to take into account that place becomes very busy at the time of the lunch and dinner
5
The concept of Mezza9 in itself is fantastic. Open kitchens with different themes, all on one menu. This provides a huge amount of choice for dinner with something for every taste.Sashimi and yakitori both come highly recommended. The waiting staff are all attentive and friendly as you would expect. This is not the lowest cost restaurant of its quality available but the experience is one worth paying for.
2
The promise of a $10 Martini is pretty awesome. However getting served is impossible. Wasted 20 minutes of my time trying to get served. Gave up and went in search of a beverage elsewhere
4
Celebrated my friend's birthday there. Had requested for a cake which they brought out towards the end of our meal. Their version of the birthday song was uptempo & unique. Had a wonderful experience there
4
Love the ambience! It was a night of good food n drinks. The staff are polite and attentive. Must order their dessert, "flower pot"
4
Tasty and good value set lunches, the japanese counter is good and the complementary bread is very tasty, especially with the tomato dip
5
We had the deep fried soon hock and a 3-course set lunch comprising a chicken consomme, a wagyu beef burger and fruit crumble with ice cream. Everything tasted great and service was excellent

There's lots of great things to be said about Mezza9. 1) The ambience, table setting, appropriate for business or executive luncheons.2) Impeccable service from our server who were attentive to our needs.3) The pricing for the 2 course/3 course lunch set looks reasonable. I was terribly let down by my own main course selection of the Sakura Chirashi Don. As seen in the photo provided, the sashimi slices were so thin, I could see the rice through the slices.My friends who tried the Lamp chops were delighted though. Could have been a great experience but was let down by a single dish.
1
We dined..4 of us the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, all main courses came together apart from one... the three diners had completely finished their meal before the fourth one came .
5
Hard to go wrong with offerings from so many cooking stations, and quality and freshness are top-notch as always. Dim romantic lights at brunch takes some getting used to, but is understandable due to the space mezza9 is at
4
Always great value for the standard of food and service. Though this visit, the service was not up to its usual standards. Steak knives should be sharpened so that having a medium rare tenderloin shouldn't be a chore

I've been to Hyatt for their high-tea and it was wonderful. Service was a bit frustrating then due to full capacity. Dinner at Mezza9 was delightful. I was brought to my table by a delightful hostess. She sat me down and dinner began with my party of 8. It was a buffet so it was a great spread. My favourite was the chicken rice. The rice was not too oily and very fragrant. The indian corner was amazing. The roti section was fabulous. Vegetarian options such as tandoori paneer and masala paneer was amazing!The satay was grilled to perfection just in front of you.Dessert was not too rich. Different kuehs and horlicks ice cream just blew my mind.Service definitely improved a bit since the last time I was there. It would be nice to have wait staff refill my glass of water or at least have a station where I can help myself.Staff manning the stations could also be a tad helpful to explain. I.e. chicken rice station, there were plates of chicken. The rice cooker was there with no sign that states help-yourself. I had to get the attention of chef to ask should I help myself.I will definitely recommend tourist to give this a try
4
Food is as good as it gets at Mezza9.The shorter version of the lunch menu is very regional and fair.Prices are good and service still needs polishing, but not bad.Needs a nudge from management to get it to a typical Mezza9 level service.Tends to be bsuy at all times, so it's quite noisy
4
This bar is inside the Grand Hyatt and attracts visitors too. It is good for business associates in the evening and later on for a social gathering
4
Third visit here. Excellent range of food. Service much improved so they are listening to feedback. Really recommend... Options from Chinese, Thai, international and sushi. Thai and Chinese dishes all good...althought both could do with more flavours.. Overall though a good experience. Would recommend and go bac

Mezza9 is my go to place in Singapore. It's built around the concept of 9 food/drink/dining aspects and that means you get global cuisine options.There has been a recent change in the lunch menu which is now grouped and is a little less stellar than it used to be but this review is about dinner which offers all options.The food encompasses fresh pan Asian and European fare and is generally of a very high quality. They also have a fantastic wine list.Service is exemplary. Shout out to Patrick and Dena. You could not want for more in terms of attentiveness and care.The concept comes with a smoking room which I personally love :) It's attache to the Martini bar which serves some of the best cocktails in Singapore.It's centrally located and taxi services are prompt at the entrance when you waddle out after a few too many
4
Visited Mezza9 for the Formula 1 Sunday Brunch Buffet. Wow! Amazing buffet! Great variety of food. Different stations offering seafood, meat, Asian, breakfast, cheeses, desserts including a chocolate fountain. Staff were very attentive, constantly re-filling glasses with wine, champagne, water and clearing empty plates. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it. Would definitely recommend..
4
Excellent kitchen, good free flow champagne (and oh my: it does flow), very pleasant staff. You will need to reserve a table, the restaurant was fully booked. The tomahawk beef was one of the highlights, the lobster another. The cheese buffet could improve however. This is the time to indulge, do not restrain yourself, the price is very steep but it was worth it. PS.: The Sofitel Manila is on par with its buffet, but one third of the pric

Was at Mezza9 with friends for dinner. Food was good. Ambience was great. Chair was a little uncomfortable. Initially the service crew were a bit disorganised. Drinks were served about 20 min after ordering. Took some time before we can attract the attention of the waitress to take our order. But once the staff were settled, the service was fine. Had an enjoyable dinner. Recommended.
3
Ordered a meat platter and it was incredibly oily. Nothing fantastic about the taste either. Their service was good but that was expected of Hyatt as I generally have a good experience with the hotel.
4
Good value, esp with 1 eat free promotion. Food is ok, not great. Portions are big. Dessert of the day is a must try.
4
Lovely setting for a champagne Sunday brunch. Really good range of foods, with seperate areas for sushi, Thai, Chinese, British roasts, seafood, salads, breads, cheeses and puddings. Really good service and friendly staff. Quite busy and did have to wait for some time for foods to be replaced, but all in all it was a great spot for a boozy brunch
3
Food was a hit and miss. Seafood platter was good though each of the crab and lobster was a bit 'fishy'. Very small chilli sauce(normal chilli sauce) accompanied it. Yong chow fried rice were normal. Chilli crab was not spicy at all so i guess it's good for those who cant take spicy. But for real local chilli crabs and lobster yee mee(this dish need a makeover!), you're better off elsewhere. Crab cakes from prime (le meridien kl) were better. A dining companion said the lobster bisque was good. The beef was really good. Tender and flavourful. We had the mixed dessert platter and kaiserschmarren (austrian pancake). Would order the pancake again. Now the service........ Hmmm... I kind of understand why the restaurant was so empty on a sunday night (and eve of a public holiday). 1. When one of us spilled water, none of the staff came to help us clean up. And even though we told the waiter that the floor was wet, he went 'oh'. And did nothing til we called him to come back and wipe the floor. 2. When they gave us a baby chair, they just left it at the side of the table without helping us to take away the extra chair3. This was the weirdest. We left the chair at the side of the table, in the middle of the walkway just to see who would remove it... And guess what.... So many staff passed by multiple times and none took the effort to remove the chair, even though it was on the walkway! 4. Waitress kept mixing up our drink ORDER (note, order not orderS). Came back with another waiter to clarify what we wanted (that was good. Wanted make sure she got the correct order). We showed it to her on the menu again. Came back few minutes later to reconfirm our order for the second time and it was the wrong order again...5. This annoyed us the most. Why do the waiters kept putting the dishes in front of the baby? We kept putting the dishes away from the baby and making space for dishes to be put on the other side but they kept putting it right in front of the baby! How can you put hot soup within the baby's reach!!!!! 6. Our mango salad(appetizer) only came out after we have finished main course...7. Since we had a 3 seafood dishes which required us to put the shells on the plate, no staff came to change our plates even though it was full until we requested for new plates.Staff need to be trained again. Need more attention to detail and be proactive. And mezza9 is in the michelin guide... Hmmm...
5
A fabulous Sunday Brunch is available and booking is essential. The food quality has always been very good and fresh. Has a good and varied menu of both eastern and Western cuisine. Fantastic Service but very busy and crowde
4
We had the sushi and sashimi platter for appetizer and for the mains, meat grill for 2. The meat was prepared to perfection. Yorkshire pudding was great. I didn't quite like the chicken but you had me with the ribs!!! I will be back for more
2
We booked the private room in the wine cellar . I think 12 people . Steak was cold and for sure not medium rare , side dishes came much later . The last dish came when the first one finished . Only one staff to take care ( or not ) . Going there since 20 years ... Sad story , especially with the good old days in mind !
5
Food and service are good, staff are willing to go out of their way to provide a good experience. Sunday champagne brunch is fantastic
5
Mezza9 is a culinary delight and gourmet spectacle with a series of stunning open kitchens. There are SO many dining options and they all look inviting. We pondered - would it be Western, Asian, Japanese, etc etc. Well we chose a fabulous bottle of Cloudy Bay and enjoyed it with lobster and crab. Just delicious. A very sophisticate ambience with terrific attentive service. A magic evening with everything. We loved Mezza9
4
The menu here has something to suit everyone and the portions are generous. Quality of ingredients and cooking is good and the ambience is relaxed but chic.
4
Food is good and service excellent. They gave us a small complimentary cake for my mother's birthday and sang her a sing. Very nicely presented. Ambience good
4
Yes Mezza9 was just great as everGreat service food delish A very pleasant evening out.The sweet was lovely
4
Best Sunday champagne brunch buffet in town, everything was just divine. Excellent selection of food, generous supply of bubble drinks. Only negative comment is I find the venue too dark for a Sunday brunch, and deco a little dated. But we love this place, and plan to come back for husband's birthday in October
4
the range of food here is large enough to please everyone. The service is good and the dishes were tast
5
I am one of those who gets put off by bad service and vow never to give my business to the same establishment again. However after a recent visit again to Mezza9 (a friends birthday party) i beg to differ and take back my past opinion of this place. The service was to die for and the food ..... gosh i have been dreaming of going back again. Love their cocktails. There is something for everyone in their well thought of and designed menu. Great ambience and lovely food served by well trained staff. Hard to find these qualities in most establishments in Singapore
4
using quality ingredients (as one would expect from a branded hotel) , most of the dishes meet expectations. While they offer Asian Japanese Thai etc., focus on the grill section as that is the best value for money.The young female staff are generally not informed; go for the male servers if you need efficient and professional hel
3
Ambience was good although could get a bit noisy. But food was only average considering the price which was on the high side. The desserts was the saving grace, loved the tiramisu in a flower pot.
5
Food was quite good and the service was excellent. Will definitely come back again. Had a very enjoyable time
1
My grandson visiting 11 yrs old 12 in October, we are gold card members .. Refused to seat us as grandson wearing shorts ... Restaurant empty.. Rang eventually getting mixed messages they confirmed it was his height.. So I asked them to confirm its not an age restriction but height and they said YES!!! Disgusted ! We use all of their restaurants at least twice a week... Humiliated and disgusted!
5
Great quality food, attentive service, good value overall. Portions for the 3-course lunch option were very generous - so large that 2 could share one portion!
5
Look no further, Mezza9's Sunday Brunch Buffet is the best buffet spread on the island! With so many different food stations, its imperative that you wisely allocate your stomach space. So much quality food to choose from that I was unable to have second helpings!Seafood - Fresh Oysters, Prawns, Crabs and Lobsters. You can also create your own dip for your seafood.Japanese - Sushi, Sashimi, Yakitori, Tempura, Miso Soup, Japanese Salads.Western - Grilled beef, Foie Gras, Mushroom Risotto, Mac n Cheese, Spinach and Mashed Potato, Burger Sliders and Fries.Chinese - Sze Chuan Chicken, Fried prawns, Dim Sum, Roast Meat.Dessert - Nitrogen Ice Cream, Gelato, Tarts, Bread and Butter Pudding, Cakes.Appetizers - Bread, Parma Ham, Waffles, Smoked Salmon, selection of fine cheese5* quality food spread coupled with excellent service. Do not forget to request for complimentary parking if you drive
4
Ordered the 3 course set meal- Blue crab cake- Angus Beef sirloin and chocolate pudding at $79++. Food was large portion and value for money for such hotel restaurant. My friend got a complimentary slice of cake and birthday song from the hotel staffs. Good dinner plc
4
Centrally located. Good food although I recommend the Asian fare. Good service. Just found my table to be a bit of a squeeze - a tad unnecessary I think! Still, go for the good Asian food
5
A few days ago I took my parents, sister & nephew who were visiting from India out to dinner. Mezza was quite full but we got a table for the 8 of us quickly. We ordered Chinese food akin to the spicy Indian palette & the food was great. The only bad thing was that I have an allergy to prawns and could only look at enviously at some of the dishes
4
We went here for their happy hour and were not disappointing. The cocktails were very nice and the wine was a big pour! Had to stop ourselves eating our body weight in the cashews though! A nigh atmosphere and a very nice start to the night. Only had drinks, so i can't comment on the food
1
I am very surprised and shocked to see my credit card statement with another extra credit card amount charged by Mezza9 for my visit on 19 Jun 2016 for champagne brunch. Three of us visited Mezza9 for champagne brunch. 1 pax of champagne brunch is SGD 174.20. The extra and unknown amount charged to me is SGD 859.21 which is almost the price for 5 pax champagne brunch. I tried to call the hotel and sent email to them but till now now immediate action taken on this case. As such, I have cancelled my credit card for preventing further unknown payment charged by Mezza9. Very disappointed for such incident and I am not sure anyone else encounter similar case like me. No one provided me bill to sign for this unknown amount but Mezza9 still charged it to me.For anyone who is going there for dining, please be alert and even if you are drunk, take a look on the bill or get someone else to check the bill. Unfortunately, for my case, I'm not drunk but I still encountered such case. Afterall, BE ALERT
4
Finally here after hearing many good review of the place.Reservation was made by a friend so upon arrival after giving my friend's name, the waitress immediately brought me to the table... Maybe she is the one that attended to my friend too!The ambience of the restaurant is nice and the price of the food too (ala carte order)!Ordered their 3 course set dinner which is value for money at $79 per pax. I had yakitori as appetizer, serving portion is good, main course I had my medium rare steak (kinda of small portion) with asparagus and dessert is flower pot (latest Korean craze) and complimentary coffee or tea.It is definitely a busy dining place on a Thursday evening
4
The set lunch has a decent range of international and Asian selections, but what stands out are the appetiser and dessert. The Yum Tua Plu and Heirloom Tomato Salads were both refreshing and appetising, so was the Galway bay smoked salmon. The Mezza9 Flower Pot was pleasing both to the sights and taste, and the Baked Fruit Crumble with Vanilla Ice Cream was excellent. This is a popular place for casual dining, with an open kitchen concept around don't expect to have an ambience for romance, but more than adequate for family/friends gathering or a decent and value business lunch in a 5-star hotel
3
Having visited Mezza9 in September 2015 we had worries about visiting again... but actually we found it better. The restaurant wasn't busy, it still suffers from the tables being packed together and put under spotlights... could be so much better if there was more space and less lighting. The food was certainly much better, but then again it was quiet so maybe the chefs had more time. Fish was good. Lots of garlic (overpowering) in the vegetables... Service was ok but again quite slow. Probably on a busy night it wouldn't be great. So overall better and we'd go back again
3
A good variety of food served here. Ok quality but nothing exceptional. Cannot find one dish that impressed me. Service is satisfactory.
4
Good selection of tasty dishes from all around the world. Atmosphere is ok but a bit bland, and tables are close to each other.
3
Used to be our favourite place that we can go at least once or twice a month. But service has been pretty bad on the last few visits. For eg, they took away the plates without asking us if we are done with it, didnt bother to top up the water etc. Disappointed with the service as the food is pretty good actually
2
We have been a great fan of this brunch location for last 7 years. However today was a big disappointment .A) smoked salmon did not have the usual accompinmemtsB) prawns and other sea food had no taste. Felt like they had been frozen for ever and thawed for 12 hours.C) no egg station which you would expect in a brunc
5
The ambience was good. Staff was pleasant and courteous. It was my friend birthday, I was delighted the staff make it speciat with a birthday rendition and complimentary slice of cake w candle. A pleasant surprise n the birthday girl was delighted. Thank you Mezza9 staff
3
I thought the service at the Mezza9 in a posh hotel like the Hyatt would be superb but what we encountered when we dined there last Saturday was a big let down. Except for a young lady by the name of Olivia, the rest of the restaurant staff we encountered were unfriendly, curt and unhelpful. Olivia was the only one who understood what service with a smile was about, and was attentive and willing to offer recommendations. Kudos to her
4
The waiters and waitresses are much more responsive than my last visit, when i had my birthday lunch there. During my last visit the waiter that i approached seems to forget to give me a return feedback when i asked for my main course, which i had been waiting for nearly an hour for the food to arrive. The manager was quick for the service recovery. Thumb up for this guy, Sebastian, hopefully i get his name right. Great work
5
A buzzy environment with a number of cooking stations offering a wide range of ingredients and cooking styles. If you want less choice there is a 3 course for 79++ which features the signature dishes from each station, various asian and a grill. Food arrived in largish portions but not all at the same time so not everyone was eating at the same time. The food was consistently good without being exceptional. The service was patchy when they were full but generally goodAll up a nice meal on the expensive side of value
5
Our hotel offered exclusively buffet meals, but after several weeks on the road, simplicity was what we were after. Stumbled upon Mezza 9 at the Grand Hyatt because it was just across the street from where we were staying. Wonderfully prepared protein selections and incredible, large bowls of several green vegetable sides offerings (we had asparagus and green beans) creatively seasoned. If we had more time, would have gone back a second time
3
We had a group dinner with our staff here, it was not good at all. Food were mediocre as if the chef put no thought into it. Sushi did not taste fresh at all. The restaurant layout is very nice, and they have private room for big meetings. It serves the purpose of our privacy but food was way below average
5
.. testament to that - its always crowded and one must book in advance. Having said that, the Hyatt team would do all possible to accommodate guests ! Great mix of Asian cuisines. Its also good for the general atmosphere.
5
I took 3 customers to Mezza9 last night and could not have been happier with the outcome. We all had the tasting menu which was delicious. We all had the steak with was very tasty and a nice size. The flower pot dessert was visually impressive and had a taste to match.I like my meal so well, I am going back solo tonight
5
The restaurant is in a location and has a nice decor and is very trendy. The menu has wide selection including a fresh seafood bar, Asian offering as well as Continental. The steaks are prime cuts and value for money with a great wine selection with a full price range. Nice cigar bar enclosed off of the main floor. A place with something for all tastes for a larger party
5
Her they have everything!The Mezza9 restaurant is a top choice in Singapore. It's not a buffe restaurant, but they still deliver variety like no other restaurant I know. I love the fact that you have Thai, Chinese, Japanese, grill, seafood++ all at the same restaurant!I believe they have 6 or 7 kitchens. Food recommendations:-lobster bisque -pork skewers-crab cake+
5
and good as the first time!This time with our son who is a world business traveler! He was impressed from the style of Mezza9! All our starters and main dishes were excellent! The service good lIke last time! The water issue I had last visit no more!Our son, we are sure will eat out at Mezza9 again, lIke we too
4
This is an upmarket buffet, very well regarded by Singapore residents. Seafood offering was exceptional and included freshly shucked oysters, crab, lobster, prawns, pippies and more. A very good range of many delicacies (the 9 in the name represents 9 food styles) with several different Asian cuisines, and reverence to the UK & USA with sausages and pork plus mini burgers! We had the champagne included in our lunch price and the glass was continually topped up (and wine was available in the package as well). Dessert selection top quality and variety. While I'll never be a buffet fan, this is one of the better ones with staff doing a great job throughout. We fully needed 3 hours to graze
4
The Sunday brunch at mezza9 is still very good -the selection of seafood is particularly good - but i had the impression that some part are not quite as good as they used to be: the waiter i had was swirling my glass of champagne to reduce the foam on top - basically making my first glass somewhat flat - instead of either waiting for the foam to subside or to use a glass that was freshly rinsed. Overall the variety of food has been reduced as well - several large items such as a roast beef and other things were not there anymore. while this might be seasonal (some items might not be available all year round) but i think it showed that there were many empty tables. nevertheless its still great and the rest of the staff was very attentive an quick to respond to orders
4
Mezza9 is at the mezzanine level of Grand Hyatt. Large, crowded and full of expats wanting to burn money. The people are nice and attentive. While crowded, the place allows you to still choose a quiet space and have a talk. Another advantage is the wide variety of food- from Chinese to European grill, and you can mix and match .There were four of us, busy in talking business but we still managed to enjoy the food. We chose to have limited food and avoided the set menus. We had the grilled salmon, grilled mushrooms (a bit charred to my liking) , asparagus & beans, sea bass and chocolate mousse. All good. Also some good Cabernet Sauvignon. All told, a pleasant meal, served well. There may be better places to spend your money, but the combination of the ambiance, service and food makes this a good place to go
4
The amount of different food stations and styles is amazing. There is almost nothing you can't get. The free flow s also top class with wonderful champagnes and wines as part of the deal. The place is a little dark but there is nothing they can do about that. It can also get a little busy, but the staff are attentive so all good.Price wise it is a little on the high side, however you will get to eat and try things that you might not ordinarily order, so it is worth the splurge
5
Tried several brunches in Singapore buy always end up coming back here The choice of food is excellent and the staff always keep your glass topped up. Hopefully the work lasts and we can keep on coming back.
5
Champagne, cocktails, bountiful food stations and incredible desserts - make sure you come hungry! Excellent service, delicious food and wonderful atmosphere are all worth the price.
5
super nice cocktails, huge choice! food menu is quite big (japanese, thai, chinese, seafood...). service is good and fast. also great for the Sunday brunch buffet.
1
The steak served was totally charred that I might have developed cancer from eating the carcinogen. When I told the waiter, he said it was a new cooking method and that it's supposed to be like that. He took it back to the kitchen and when the second attempt came back, it was still much more charred than usual and they forgot to serve it with the vegetables. Some Chef finally brought us the veg and when I told him both pieces were badly charred for a medium doneness and thus gave it a bitter taste, he was unapologetic about it! I didn't finish the second steak and only took a bite of the first one. It's appalling that a hotel like this would provide such awful service and food. I've been to many steakhouses and this is definitely unacceptable to me. Will try not to patronise again. One waiter was particularly nice and attentive but it wasn't just the steak that left me a bitter taste.
5
we went so many times that i do not even count ! The best sunday brunch, it has all and price still reasonable for Singapore and the quality offered.
5
We've been here a few times, almost always with 6 or more people. The menu is varied and caters to many different requirements, and does it well. Truly a treasure and they do specialized menus seasonally, too
5
We were in rush to eat our lunch before going to the airport. They brought the foods relatively faster and the tastes were excellent. The volume was enough for us to travel to KUL eithout taking the airline foods
4
Food was great! The lobster set lunch was delicious and the seafood fresh. Double boiled soup with the 2/3-course set lunch was very tasty. The baby high chair was comfortable and sturdy - the restaurant even provided a small box of colour pencils and the kids' menu had some coloring activity to keep children engaged. Overall, an enjoyable meal and experience
4
I was there for a business lunch. The person who ordered, knew what he was ordering so we just enjoyed the amazing seafood. We ordered sushi, yakitori, steamed and deep fried fish, crab cakes and most amazing sea food noodles.  Loved the food. Surprisingly it wasn't that expensive. Thumbs u

Very underwhelmed. Martini menu long, but service for drinks & food longer. Happy hourprices don't make up for long wait.

Not too far away from wherever you are in Singapore, the Mezza9 is a restaurant within the Hyatt Singapore hotel, easily accessible via the MRT/Subway, major bus routes and or Taxis. My first experience with Mezza9 was when it first opened it's doors as a F&B outlet of the Hotel. My recollections of the experience was stylish and the menu, well-curated. I returned after a 6 years stint in Hong Kong, to find out that the Mezza9 now serves a weekly Sunday Brunch. I finally tried it! It was delightful. I love Sunday brunches, as it's such a treat to the palate, a great way to start the week!The Sunday brunch comes with a free flow of champagne, wines, juices, as well as other hot beverages. The buffet set up itself is a visual treat. Even though it was buffet style, but the restaurant showed their attention to details in creating the overall dinning experience. I was especially elated when I tasted the slider - a simple bar snack, but every bite is juicy and flavorful. If you are a fan of good hams and cold cuts, they offer a good selection of cuts, along with pate; great deal when you are a wine lover like I am. Cheeses on the board are also something to look forward to.With most brunches, the fresh seafood counter is not to be missed, however, at the Mezza9, I'll strongly encourage you to take a chance on the rest of the international cuisines presented.One thing lacking though was there isn't any soup selection on the offer, except Miso Soup, the day I went. The dessert & sweets area could do better with more choices of cakes. It's a great place for friends and family get together. Even if you have friends who are visiting Singapore as tourists. Mezza9 might want to consider offering a pricing option for non-alcohol dinning - but I must qualify that, the outlet is not stingy with their champagne and drinks, waiting staff are always ready to top your glass up
3
What you get once you don't upgrade a place for 15 years? Worn out wooden floors with traffic lines, greasy traffic lines from open kitchens to the back of the house, scuffs in wood - in general, a place ready for a revamp.You may come there for the experience and to see what was the Wow effect of the turn of the Century in Singapore. That shine is long gone.Food is fine but very overpriced. Once combined with worn out surroundings, it is definitely not worth the high dollar that this place charges.Look closely at the open kitchen and how the food is being prepared by kitchen staff. I was looking for a while and have not seen any of them actually cleaning their knives or cutting boards in any other manner then wiping them with a piece of kitchen rag. I guess they never heard of using a cleaner or sanitizer to actually make the food safe. Again, factor the price you pay and you may give a miss to this place that lost its touch and luster long time ago.Oh, you may also wish for a more friendly staff at the reception desk of that restaurant. They definitely can use a mirror there to learn how to smile and great guests more politely - not as intruders. Please keep in mind that this is not the only gig in town
2
I used to like Mezza9 as one of the premium restaurants for nice food in a nice setting, but I was so disappointed. The food has become so-so, the place is still nice, but the service is so bad, as if we had to beg to get attention ! The hotel staff at the front desk who showed us how to get to Mezza9 was great, but the restaurant waitress was downright rude and just walked away halfway when we were talking....they really need to buck up

Had a dinner here a few weeks back with my colleagues. We managed to make a reservation for 10 pax for an engagement dinner, where we were accommodated in a private room. The reservation policy here is one of the weirdest one i've experienced. On reservation, you have to leave your credit card details and should any of your member not turn up, you will be levied a cancellation fee of $100 per pax. (pretty high and unrealistic)That aside, the service was okay, and we get a private room (which was pretty cool). Food we ordered were very normal. I recall the appetisers being pretty nice and appealing although I can't say the same for the other dishes. In particular, for our main course, some of our orders were mixed up, where medium rare and medium steak were swapped. Pretty unprofessional in my opinion for such a mix-up to happen. For our coffee and tea at the end, one of our orders was also not served until we gave our feedback.Overall, i'm pretty mixed about this place. Environment-wise it's quite conducive, but the food doesn't really justify price and service was only so-so
1
The service level from service staff is way below expectations. A very disappointed first dining experience.

I had a very strange experience at Mezza 9 which I am sharing. Qualification: I would really appreciate a response from the restaurant and I have (as you will see) qualified my criticism. I was staying at the Grand Hyatt Singapore and planned dinner with a good friend. Mezza 9 has a great, theatrical ambience - lots of hustle, fresh food, seafood on display and resembles a market. 10/10 for visual impact. Service staff - fantastic - attentive, quick and on-the-ball. Drinks - very good - we had martinis and Pinot Noir - faultless. So far, so great. Here is where it unravelled in my opinion. We ordered crab cakes and spring rolls. Remember: we are in Singapore where seafood is plentiful and Chinese/Asian cuisine is in the DNA. Crab cakes arrived looking suspiciously large (= potato or similar padding) and uniform in size (ie made earlier or - maybe - off premises?). Horror of horrors - were they frozen and reheated? And - the ultimate crime - was a jukebox (aka microwave) involved? Outside was dry and crunchy, inside heavy, lumpy and not at all crab-by. To me the ideal crab cake is made from scratch, in the restaurant. I did not get this sensation at all. They were also expensive - about S$18 or so - US$15 for four. Onto the spring rolls. Similar suspicions: very large, with the appearance of being pre-made and/or frozen. They were also lava-like in terms of heat - and that artificial, metallic, microwave scorching heat vs. the heat from a wok or a pan or an oven. Inside - duck I think? Very bland and no impression of being made with any passion or love - just a lump of blandness. As said, I am very happy to hear "the facts" behind these dishes, but in my opinion, for that sort of money, crab cakes and spring rolls should be made fresh, from scratch on-premises, to order. On to the main course - and it was night and day different. In a good way. A delicious, simple tenderloin, done to perfection. 10/10. Spinach and mushrooms great - 8/10. The only let down was the french fries which were bog-standard and had zero imagination - greasy, boring and predictable. 3/10. You will note from my other reviews that a) I am not a prolific reviewer and b) I largely celebrate vs. complain. It was just such a disappointment having seen the vibrant, visual, food display at Mezza 9 - to then be served stuff that tasted pre-made, pre-cooked, unloved and microwaved. If I am wrong and all my comments are without foundation, I am sure the restaurant will tell me. I'd be really delighted to be proved wrong. (Hint to team at Mezza 9: Google image search "fresh crab cake" and "home made spring rolls" and compare with what you are serving. It might be a useful exercise.) Thanks

Highly recommend Mezza9. Had a superb dinner with awesome service. Very helpful waitstaff to help you with a very diversified menu. Everything we tried was excellent.

First thing to say is that this isn't really a Japanese restaurant. Serving a mix of European, Thai and Japanese it's a mongrel. The limited variety of Japanese dishes it does serve taste great but you can't order specific types of Sushi, Sashimi or anything.Quality of the dishes was good but not excellent and certainly not the standard the price demands. Lobster Bisque was ok, fish cakes were greasy but passable. 8 skewers of grilled meats were cold but otherwise tasty. Ambience was ok but considering it is set on the 1st floor of the Hyatt I would have expected a cooler or chic'er vibe.All in all I was very under-whelmed. And out of pocket

Have been here for Sunday brunch before which of course is great, but recently we went for dinner which was a pretty different experience. Probably we will stick to brunch..
4
We had travelled a full day, freshened up and met here with clients for dinner. The aperitif starters were delicious and would have sufficed. Then the chili mud crab arrived. It was very good and something different. Not too spicy though. We enjoyed watching the various chefs located throughout the open plan restaurant. For dessert I was treated to a flower pot, quite an artistic creation with delicious flavours. The chocolate mousse was as good and when the manager asked which one I preferred, I couldn't decide. The service of the various wait staff was really attentive and there was not a long wait between courses. I would certainly recommend eating here, especially if you are looking for something out of the ordinary.
3
Food was delicious, although slightly over cooked in some cases, and with better service on par with the prices, would have deserved 4 stars
5
of what you want for a good dinner! The atmosphere is so fantastic!All the cooking places to see is already worth to go! The staff is very "fresh" and friendly. The meal was excellent. I can really recommend the lamb chops. All overthe world I have them, this are one of the best!There is only one advise for the management, you should not promote so muchthe sparkling and still water. Also offer plain water, please.Any time we are in Singapore we will have Dinner at the mezza9

I have in the past stayed at the Hyatt and eaten here many times. On this trip I was just across the street and when a local friend offered to meet me for dinner he suggested Mezza9.It's basically a VERY expensive food court except it's buffet style. It features all the local cuisines that I adore about Singapore. While the food was overall very good I was very disappointed at the slow and almost rude service we received. Add the very high prices and 3 stars is even being generous.I'll be back in Singapore in just a few weeks. I don't know if this place will be on my list or not after this past bad experience
4
I have dined here a few times over the years but this was the first time in 10 years so I was keen to see if it was as good as I remembered. It's an excellent dining area, open kitchen and wide choice of cuisines, and it felt the same as it was all those years ago. However it's pretty expensive, we paid £135 for a three course set dinner for two with wine, cheapest bottle on the menu. The food was great especially the desserts but I felt that you can find better value elsewhere now in Singapore for fine dining. I still like Mezza9 and encourage people to try it for themselves but be prepared to pay top dollar.
5
Delicious, sustainable and sourced from around the world... you cant beat the food☺. The service is fantastic and the french champagne flows freely... mezza9 really is a must do when visiting singapore!!
4
Having eaten many times in this restaurant I'm am disappointed at how poor the service has become. Standard of food remains good, and there's certainly plenty of choice from the 9 stations, however the flustered waiting staff seem to be struggling to maintain a good standard of service. Come on, Hyatt, this isn't good enough.
5
A must there on my many trips to Singapore. They always try to please. Choices of Western and Asian foods. Staff shortage has changed a little of the excellent service but they do try. Always recommend the Chinese counter. Chefs leave you feeling stuffed! Not forgetting the desserts! One can choose private or caual dinning which is always nice. Like the counter dinning as one gets to watch the chefs. Always a wonderful experience of satisfaction on leaving
5
This is probably the best Brunch in the world. Dozens of food stations showcasing the best cuisines from around the world, the highlight being the wonderful fresh seafood. The drinks package includes unlimited French Champagne, beer, wines and selected cocktails. Attentive staff, wonderful decor and background music means you can settle in for a lazy lunch over some four hours in duration. Perfect for a romantic lunch for two or a larger group. Private rooms avaiable. No trip to Singapore is complete without this experience
3
We picked Mezza9 due to location and it had a buffet with a wide arrange of choice. The problem to my mind is that the choice was all wide array of pretty mediocre dishes. I didn't try the sushi but with a few exceptions, the food looked great but lacked that special something. I'd skip it and go elsewhere.
5
My husband to took me here to celebrate my 30th birthday. The food was fantastic and Perrier Jouet is one of my favorite champagnes. :) We will definitely book a sunday brunch here again next time we visit Singapore
4
After reading some negative reviews recently I was a bit tentative about returning. Have eaten at this restaurant several times with no major issues. We were pleasantly surprised. Service was excellent , food was up to standard based on what we ordered. Only minor criticism is that there will always be timing issues with cold toon of various cuisines which is understandable but not really an issue for us. Overall experience was up to previous standards & will certainly be back as this formula satisfies the different tastes in food that my partner & I have. We like different cuisines & Mezza9 gives us both plenty of choice.
2
As we walked into the restaurant on 23rd Sept, nobody bothered tos serve us even though they saw us standing near the entrance. We had to get their attention to tell them we have a reservation and PLEASE get us seated. After dinner, we requested for dessert menu, 3 times before it was actually brought to us. Food was... so so
5
The selection and quality of food at the sunday brunch has never suffered over the years and this year too, the overall experience in this regard is better than before. The extensive variety of fresh seafood, meats combined with different types of cuisine, make this brunch suitable for any type of palate. Add premium champagne to your experience and you will not regret the visit.I would caution you to limit your breakfast, and even previous night's dinner consumption if you want to really take advantage of the wide selection of food on offer. Plan to spend at least a minimum hour and a half to savour everything this brunch has to offer.The service is always excellent since the staff are well-versed in handling the distinct requirement of the wide viariety of clientele including tourists, locals, couples, families and groups. The quality of service flows whether you book an early table or come in at lunch time. The key is enjoy the whole experience. Highly recommended as the sunday brunch of choice to anyone looking for high quality and a comparatively lower price point than what others charge

Really enjoyed it the different variaties and extensive menu was really good.Service left a bit to be desired but once told of the issues very quick response and all sorte

As residents of the apartments next door to Hyatt, we've frequented Mezza9 now on several occasions and nearly every time we've left very disappointed. Tonight was no exception to the subpar experience, so I've decided it's best to share.Pros:* Convenient location, menu offers a variety of cuisines, open late, other adjacent dining options including martini bar, pizza and dessert bar.If you want a good cocktail, better off going to the adjacent martini bar. Ordering drinks from the martini bar in the restaurant, expect up to a 15-20 mins. wait for the drink to arrive to the table.As a 4-star property touting the 'Grand Hyatt' brand name, if a diner prefers to offer an item from the downstairs pizza menu, expect to be told "we can try to accommodate, but we prefer not to."Cons:* Food -- while the menu is vast, the menu leave much to be desired. Most of the starters are very poor including the spring rolls and crab cakes, both of which are heavily fried to compensate for the lack of flavor. The Caesar salad comes with bacon, and if you like bacon, you would be disappointed as the salad is mostly romaine lettuce with a croutons and just a few bacon bits.* Service -- the staff is abundant including at least 2 Managers on duty, yet collectively there still exists an embarrassing level of attentiveness and frankly incompetency. When asking the wait staff a basic question like "what is in the Mezza9 salad dressing", every question is responded to with an "I don't know, let me check with the chef." Having frequented Mezza9 as many times as we have, I know this is not new staff. These are employees who have been employed as Mezza9 wait staff for at least a year and still don't know what's in the house salad dressing. And I was not asking for every ingredient, just in general, i.e., is it a vinaigrette or cream based dressing? And even the Managers are not top notch, case in point, charging the same $50 delivery fee to a frequent customer in Scotts Square next door as to a random request to East Coast.* Price: Aside from the lofty delivery fee, the menu prices are steep. Expect a >$200 bill for a couple of appetizers, shared lower priced entree, a couple of drinks and dessert.Bottom line, if in the area and no other dining options available, Mezza9 would suffice, but go with low expectations. Otherwise, Marriott two doors down may be a better option

We went for the Sunday Champagne Brunch. What fantastic value! There are so many food stations - a stunning amount of sushi and fresh fish, all beautifully presented. Roast stations (both Western and Chinese), steamed dumplings, yakitori, lovely range of cheeses and cold cuts of meats, and of course, the delicious desserts! We were so impressed with the service - plates removed swiftly (in time for you to come back for more!), finger bowls magically appeared by my side when peeling prawns/shrimp, and very regular topping up of the champagne, wine or beer. We felt that the brunch was excellent value for money, as they seemed very generous in food, service, drinks - and a lovely, relaxed environment. Will definitely be back
1
Our table was located in a corner with little, if any, ambience. After 30 mintues from being seated, it was necessary to ask for a wine list. When our main course was finished, the staff left dishes on the table for some time. Many of the tables around us were not cleared of dishes. All staff attention was given to a large group seated nearby. As usual, the food was good but the table service was very disappointing
1
Took 30 minutes to bring one beer and a glass of wine to the table. Food was disappointing.. Ordered prawns and three fairly small ones delivered...ordered same dish again this time 4 came. Food Luke warm but tasted ok. After over 90 mins asked for bill...didn't arrive chased three times and then we walked out...at that point the staff woke up. Blindingly bright lighting...tables squashed together. Tables too big to allow a couple to talk. Nothing to like about this restaurant...avoid there are many that are bette
3
First impression is nice. Waitress, though untrained, was helpful. We ordered Pate. We were shocked to taste strong alcohol in the pate, actually too strong it is inedible. informed the waitress and told her to take it back and to tell the Chef. No Manager neither the Chef came to address the issue.Then the Lamb Chops came, just with miserable chops on the plate...no grilled vegetable, no salad, no potatoes nothing....For the price SGD48 for the chops, how much does it cost to put a few leaves??? Very unprofessional indeed.... Disappointing...Then we ordered the sautéed spinach... The spinach came very mashed and it is even FROZEN spinach, not fresh.... We do not understand why in Singapore, Spinach is not available....if we are in Alaska it is understood....Overall, we are not happy at all with the show business of the class of place Mezza9 is... the service and food quality is so bad, it is a shame.
4
Many choice of cruisine and something for somebody. Surprised that the local food are quite good.Good get together plac

Very nice restaurant in the Grand Hyatt. Extensive menu and very good service. We were very late arriving but there was no problem with the table being held for us. The staff were also very accommodating as we were late finishing. The atmosphere is quite calming and relaxing. A really good dining experience
4
a reservation is always advisable. tried the set lunch. choice is good. quality of food is excellent.
5
Excellent value for money. Unlimited buffet and huge selection and variation of cuisine. Had two hours of great foods, and fresh juice. Ambience was fantastic. Can't rate this restaurant highly enough. Unfortunately it was, as should be expected, crouded at lunch time, but lay-out of tables was very good, and we didn't feel like we were "sqeezed-in" as you are in other successfull restaurants

Mezza9's brunch and afternoon tea buffets need no introduction. Their handcrafted pralines and seasonal offerings, such as their toothsome mooncakes for the Mid Autumn Festival which falls on the 15th day of the eighth Lunar month, are available for takeaway and make great gifts with their pretty boxes. Mooncakes are sweet, round cakes filled with lotus seed paste. The baked mooncake contains a salted egg yolk in the centre representing the full moon that is witnessed on the night if the Mid Autumn Festival. It provides a savoury contrast to the sweet lotus seed paste filling. Mezza9 offers a contemporary fusion alternative of chilled mini mooncakes with a thin marzipan-like dough filled with lotus paste. Each mini mooncake contains a round chocolate truffle which replaces the traditional egg yolk to represent the full moon. These delectable truffle centres are infused with champagne or the Grand Hyatt's signature cocktails such as strawberry margarita and lychee martini. The non alcoholic mooncake centres include black sesame and durian.Service was prompt and polite when I dropped by in the late afternoon to buy some mooncakes. The staff obligingly customized my order to include eight different flavours in a gift box that can be recycled as a ornamental case for knick knacks
4
We went for a few drinks and sat in the martini bar lounge which was quite nice. They have a comprehensive cocktail menu with great options.
5
Fantastic food! Choice of Chinese, Japanese, European. Everything was beautifully prepared and presented. It was mind blowing walking around the food stations being tempted by the range and quality of food on offer and that was just the starters and mains. The desserts were equally alluring and delicious. The waiters were brilliant; they discreetly topped up glasses, cleared plates and ensured each guest was well looked after. A great way to spend Sunday with family and friends
5
Amazing food, service, and great time with family. We ordered so much food and everything was beautifully presented and tasted amazing! When I come back to Singapore, I will definitely be coming back here
4
Such a large choice and most of it top quality, the place is really with visiting for dinner. Singapore standard for service always very much appreciated
4
hip place to mingle and occassionaly get martini deals. great crowd with light edm / mix rnb music. pretty decent finger foods
2
While there was lots of variety of food all of it was rather average quality and certainly not worth the price
4
Great ambience and their service was rather prompt! Variety of Food selections for Lunch Set! Crowded as usual, please book in advance!
4
For business or for pleasure, we have dined her a plenty. There are many choices of cuisines...from Japanese yakitori, sushi, Western to Chinese food...you have good for everyone. Prices are not cheap but the quality is good. It's a failed proof place if you are entertaining on business. If you want a special experience, book the wine cellar. It's a fabulous experience to dine there. Advance reservations required
5
Wonderful Sunday brunch with family. Great food options especially for kids and plentiful choices for adults. It was my birthday and I was treated to a cake and a sing song!! Perrier Jouet champagne offered throughout the brunch along with cocktails and soft drinks glasses were very regularly topped up.Food was of a very high standard and plenty choice for everyone including roast meats, kebabs, Peking duck, cheese, charcuterie and kids favourites. A great experience all round and a must do while in Singapore. Highly recommended.
3
This is one of the leading restaurants at the Grand Hyatt. I tried the 3 course combo priced at S$ 79 and was very disappointed. The crab cakes were bland and dull and the lamb shanks had way too much fat on it. The girls who serve here are inexperienced and lack the capacity to serve a large restaurant such as this. The wine list is good but expensive (as expected). The Hyatt needs a better signature restaurant on its property
4
My good friend took me out for birthday Sunday brunch. Have been here before but it has minor changes. The spread of the bunch was amazing. From fresh seafood such as Oysters, Western food section, Chinese food section, Indian food section to a good dessert station.Talk about gluttony. Stuffed to the brim. Oysters, char siew (bbq pork) and chocolate desserts were delicious. I was quite impressed with the service especially the Chef over the Chinese food station. Even though the BBQ pork (char siew) for servicing has finished, he went all the way to get me a small platter of it
3
Attended a private dinner in the cellar dining room - nice concept as you dine surrounded by bottles - service was mixed - one of the wait staff dropped sauce on my jacket whilst serving another guest but overall not too bad. Food was overall good - good sushi, more average Mediterranean dishes, very good and well presented dessert. One issue - dishes came in fast succession and with little reference to what they were - risky as some dishes had crab in it, to which I am allergic... would be good for staff to pay more attention to these issues and forewarn guests.However, the really shocking aspect was the way incredibly fine wines were presented. Unless they are fake (which the way bottles were wrapped in cellophane suggest is not the case), it was really disheartening to see Petrus and no less than two La Tache 2005, an all time favourite, amongst others, standing upwards in a room with such obvious variations in temperature and direct lighting. Just appalling. This makes no sense whatsoever and would also suggest to avoid at all cost buying any decent bottle in this restaurant due to the way these are cared for
3
Food was actually just okay for me. Had the chicken, was kind of tough. It was mum's birthday when we were there. The staff prepared dessert and did not charge me for it. They even gathered a few staff and sang a birthday song for her! Mum was elated
2
It had been a couple of years since I went to Mezza9. It used to be one of my favourite restaurant in Singapore....What a disappointment. The ambience is still very nice and I am a big fan of the concept but ...Service is slow (not enough staff)The menu looks like a menu (I mean the material) from a diner and worst...the food was bad. We took as a main course the grilled seafood. It was chewy and completely tasteless. What a shame as it is supposed to be a very good restaurant.
5
We have been here a few times for Sunday brunch and have always been impressed.We came last Sunday with a group of friends (12 pax) to celebrate my wife's birthday. Due to the number of Pax we were given a private room, which turned out to be the wine cellar. The room was very well presented and it was great to be surrounded by thousands of bottles of wine from all over the world. It gave us a very intimate experience and even though it was a buffet we had our own drinks waiter to ensure we didn't dehydrate!! The food is always great, very well prepared and well presented. A huge variety of seafood, Japanese, Western, Asian food and an awesome dessert bar, complete with chocolate fountain.Free flow French Champagne, beer, red and white wines from 11.30am to 3pm.I would strongly recommend the Sunday brunch, whether it is a small gathering or a large group you will not be disappointed!
5
Starting with fresh oysters, continuing through mouthwatering Spanish jamon, and then a full range of Asian and meat-focused delicacies... not to mention scrumptious seafood and Dim Sum. Although we weren't exactly still hungry, we powered through and savored the assorted cheese platter and the thoughtfully bite-sized desserts. Throughout the meal, friendly waiters were passing often and pouring the bubbles generously - nothing quite like sharing free-flow Perrier Jouet with friends to top off the perfect Sunday experience
5
What a great place to eat, staff were superb & very welcoming. From the F&B manager, the chef, and waiting staff I could not fault the attentive nature and recommendations. The food was stunning in presentation and taste. I will definitely be back.Great restauran
3
high priced. Service was not as good as usual. Sword fish was good. Had to send back the champaign. Bla Bla Bla. Most of my dinners have been very good. So hopefully this was a one-off
5
The healthy salmon salad was excellent. It was so filling I wasn't hungry for the fruit dessert. Service was good, too. I'd go there again
4
Definitely tops the list of Sunday Brunch in Singapore when it comes to selection of cuisines and generosity with Pierre Jouet champagne. Great value for money if you are into charcuterie, cheese and fresh seafood. Love the idea of a chef carefully carving jamon at the buffet. Food is replenished efficiently, no station was left almost empty. The Japanese section was my favourite for its wide range of fresh sushi, sashimi and even yakitori. Service associates constantly refill our champagne glasses and clear our soiled dishes. Their unobtrusive service was commendable, however lack of interpersonal skill when attending to questions. They didn't seem too pleased to interact with guests - very cold.  
5
We had brunch for my birthday here and it was superb! A nice table for 8 tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main restaurant. Amazing selection of all types of food from sashimi, oysters (although a couple didn't look particularly fresh!), dim sim to perfectly cooked roast meats and tempting sweets. The wines and beers were topped up regularly and were premium - we even got entertained by the magician! It is expensive but compared to other hotels that do brunch it's reasonable. I would highly recommend treating yourself to a leisurely brunch
4
We came here for Sunday Brunch on the Easter weekend. I booked a few months in advance online and very glad I did. The line up the stairs at the start of brunch was huge! We got there at 11.30am and didn't have to wait too long to be seated. It appears to be very family friendly - lots of kids & of course tables decorated with Easter goodies. They do tend to cram the tables in a bit and we were pretty close to the next table but the one thing they really need to pay attention to is the amount of room for people to get past those who are at a station choosing food without having to walk around diners tables. There is a huge selection of food here. However, I was disappointed that there were no real traditional Singaporean dishes. Good seafood choices of prawns, scallops, mudcrab, lobster, nice asian choices of duck, dumplings, buns, noodles & stir frys, Wagyu roast (although a little on the rare side for a lot of people) and a big selection of desserts. We stayed until brunch finished at 3.30pm. The cost for two people with champies came to $400. Quite expensive but hey what are holidays for! An enjoyable way to spend 4 hours - eating & drinking...
3
I've been to Mezza9 a few times but recently I had lunch there on 3 occasions over 3 weeks with different family members and friends. We went for the set menus out of convenience. One one occasion the salad was a lunch rather then appetizer portion. In a way it was good as the main course choice of shepherds pie which followed was too salty and had to be abandoned. The Thai fish cake appetiser also turned out different on 2 visits - once with and subsequent without sauce. Overall the bento and yakitori sets were best. The lobster set was not up to expectation however. Increasing the price to include coffee was a good move since I need my coffee to end my meal and the accompanying choc cookie is good.Skip the desserts as they are uninteresting
4
My friends and I had Sunday brunch at Mezza9 and was very pleased with the experience. The restaurant itself isn't particularly dazzling, being housed in the mezzanine floor of the hotel - there's a distinct paucity of natural light and the low ceilings can make it seem slightly claustrophobic. But you'll soon forget about the slightly dark surroundings once you hit the buffet counters.With several open kitchens, a comprehensive seafood section, a vast variety of desserts and a central carvery serving up solid roast meats, there's something for everyone here, and there's not a single counter that disappointed. Highly recommended if you're not too bothered with the slightly dark ambiance
4
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore in one of my favourite hotels in Asia. Casual but a sophisticated ambience. Great food. Steaks to die for. Great wine list and a convenient smoking room nearby (also to die for presumably). Generally a cut above hotel dining. The only thing I dislike is the seating arrangements. If you are seated in a table for two, you will be closer to the person on the next table than your dining partner. You will hear their every word and they will hear yours. Forget any confidential business discussions, marriage proposals, divorce announcements or anything you don't want complete strangers to be privy to. I can't imagine what the Designers were thinking by this move so my advice: book early or dine in a party of 4+.

I went here for a Sunday brunch and it was quite crowded, many foreigners and many large groups. This is a great place for many types of diners and the restaurant is so large you can easily enjoy a quiet intimate corner for two, a private dining room for a large family, a big round table for a couple of families or any other type of diner.A real drawback, and perhaps it was just for this brunch, but they seem to have squeezed tables into every possible space and even places they shouldn't have, so you were often having to wait to walk through narrow walkways or trying not to bump seated guests while getting around someone getting food. I even saw a table setup at the hostess stand in the front.A big selling point for us was their family friendly atmosphere and they did not disappoint in this area. They have taken one of the above mentioned private dining rooms and turned it into a kids "camp" staffed with at least three "Counselors" who do a great job interacting with toddlers to teens. This is a free service that allows the adults to relax, talk, enjoy their meals and try many of the different selections. And there are many different types of food to choose from, I've been told that the 9 in their name refers to the nine different kitchens. There is Sushi, Yakitori, general asian, western, seafood, dessert and others I probably missed. Because of their show kitchen concept this isn't a buffet where the food questionably comes out in chafing dishes prepared in the back; this is food being prepared right in front of you and then often being refreshed into the serving dishes as you are taking. The food preparation doesn't get much fresher, especially for a buffet.I think almost everyone should be able to find something to eat, although I didn't see an Indian section or dedicated vegetarian food; and there wasn't a traditional western breakfast items at this brunch, egg station etc...None of us took part in the champagne part of the brunch, but there were bottles popping everywhere and I saw many other drinks, wine, beer and cocktails going by; and they gave us free flow of coffee and soft drinks as well. Often you ask at a buffet for a beer or a soda and you're told it isn't included, it looks like they will serve you any drink you ask for, and your bill will only reflect alcohol or not.Speaking of the bill it is very expensive to dine here, over $135 without alcohol. This wouldn't be a regular weekend activity but for a group with kids this is a great place to get together for a special occasion
5
I celebrated a special occasion and started off at the Martini Bar. Half price martinis until 9pm even on a Saturday evening was excellent value for money. The extensive Martini menu allowed us to try some variations and these well mixed to perfect perfection.We then moved to our dinning table at the restaurant where we made our selection and we suitable impressed by the flavours, portions, and the service.After a great 3 course meal, we made our way back to the Martini bar, where the staff had arranged a complimentary cake for the celebration.... very nice touch!I am fortunate to eat out on a regular basis, but I do not normally review restaurants.... but now and again, when the experience is that good it far exceeds your expectations..... then it deserves a review.Well done to the all the staff at Mezza9/Martini Bar.... awesome in all aspects!!
5
Mezza9 has the best food on their buffet. The atmosphere is not as good as some of the others but the food is great. I would like it if there were less kids but that isn't their fault. Despite these faults I'll still go back.
5
Easily one of Singapore's Top 3 places for Sunday "Champagne" Brunch. After living here for over 2.5 years, I've been to them all. Mezza9 continues to get my repeat visits, but what made me FINALLY write a review is a specific waitress assigned to our private room. We booked the private room for 14 and assigned Stephanie as our private waitress. Finding good service in Singapore is like finding a needle in a haystack. And I'm not going to say I've had great service @ Mezza 9 in the past, but boy did we hit the JACKPOT with Stephanie. She just GOT IT
1
Terrible service- waited an hour for entre. Manager on duty provided platitudes but was too busy talking to staff at counter to understand what paying customers are experiencing.Terrible- I will not return even though have been going there for 16 years. That gives you an idea just how atrocious the service was tonight
5
Although I haven't tried all the Sunday Brunch joints in Singapore this is the one we keep coming back to! Extensive selection of Asian and western foods, the best seafood selection and some amazing slow-cooked beef! The champagne is good quality as is the wine, don't bother with the cocktails though. Special mention for Stefan the magician, great entertainer!
4
Mezza9 is my favorite restaurant in Singapore. It is sophisticated, consistent, and imaginative. It is so good that I joined the Hyatt dining club, which is an annual membership providing discounts and incentives in the restaurant.There are Table d'Hote and a La Carte options; and a good selection of reasonably priced wines. We have had many family celebrations at the Mezza9, and friends also. Every time we have enjoyed it, and had good value! If you are looking for a venue for a special occasion or a memorable night get down to Mezza9
5
This place never fails to impress me. The food is always good and service is awesome. It can be a little noisy. Not good for romantic dinner but nice for big group gatherings. Great happy, happening atmosphere.
5
Great place for brunch...the staff is exceptional, Grace is fantastic. There's not a better place for brunch in Singapore..highly recommen
4
Great selection, a very well designed restaurant and all the food was excellent. Pretty much cant fault it. Not cheap but very good
4
This restaurant is undoubtedly one of the best food experiences in Asia (no exaggeration) .... but the service is simply appalling..... but this is not uncommon in Singapore. They were very busy on the Saturday night and our daughter (a resident of 8 years) said their Sunday Brunch is exceptional; but too busy and crowded.** booked a table for 4 and were seated at a table for 6..... asked to be relocated to a table for 4 which was not an issue... but WHY did they give us a 6 in the first place?** wait for 20 mins after seating and then have to ask for a drinks menu** had to ask for 4 serviettes, as they had forgotten them when they set the table.** had to ask for drinks top ups.** had to ask twice for the check,I hope you do not think I am being too tough here, but this is a 5 star hotel and their service should be exceptional. BUT their vast quality menu provided 5 star food that did not disappoint and as it was a special occasion the 5 start price did not worry us
5
It was a surprise by my boyfriend. The last time we visited Mezza9 was when we just started dating, so he decided to bring me back here. The quality of food hasn't changed, so is the frequency of the food being replenished on the spread. The generous pouring of their ever enjoyable Perrier Jouet champagne was really another draw factor. The friendly and ever helpful wait staffs made the whole experience all rounded. After the meal, a number of wait staffs gathered around our table, I thought what was going on. They produced a cake and sang me a birthday song, the Mezza9 style. It was truly memorable, from the food, to the beverage, and to the service.

Great choice of the freshest food prepared just in front of you in a modern and trendy atmosphere.
From seafood, to meats and with a tempting variety of vegetables, you will find what you like.

We had a brunch at The Mezaa. Perfect service, wonderful environment and absolutely marvellous food. Not cheap but you get what you pay for: highest quality of ingredients and fantastic environment .highly recommended!

We were at Mezza9 for the Champagne Sunday Brunch recommended by some friends residents in Singapore who presented it to us as the best brunch in the City. The place was overcrowded, the tables very near either to each other or to the food stations and people were walking behind our chair once and another but the service was polite and efficient and the glasses were never left empty.The great variety of cuisines is exceptional and for all tastes and the open kitchen concept makes for a beautiful ambiance.The seafood on offer is huge and you can choose from Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai and American food. You can even find ham cut live.The prices are as expected at a 5* Hotel in the most expensive and busiest area and reservations are highly recommended.For lovers of Asian cuisines that do not expect to find much Western cuisine

We came for weekend lunch set on Saturday. It is a nice atmosphere to this place with all the open areas cooking but at the end the food is only so-so. Ordinary food, limited menu but at expensive prices. If the prices were lower such that the food had good value, then maybe the ambience and the food would get a better rating.
3
Food was very good, but service was too slow. the waiter served main course too late after the appetizer, and desserts after the main course
3
Having been a regular at the Mezza9 over the years, I have always been impressed by its food and service. A recent lunch visit yesterday, however, left a sour taste in my mouth as far as service was concerned. My wife and I arrived at about 2pm for a late lunch (the restaurant closes at 3pm). We were seated at a far end of the restaurant, and in such a situation, you hope that you would not be forgotten by the service staff. Unfortunately, it appeared to happen to us on this occasion.Our bread took ages to arrive and when it finally appeared, it came along with my wife's main course and my starter and main course (I had the 2-course set lunch). There was no explanation why the bread took so long to arrive, and also why my starter and main course arrived at the same time. To compound matters, the service staff simply left my main course at the edge of the table and left - hardly the service you would expect from a restaurant in a 5-star hotel. We were thus left in a situation where we felt rushed to finish our food. The redeeming factor in this instance was the food which was excellent as always. I hope our experience was a one-off and not an accurate representation of the current service standards at Mezza9. We will be back and will hope that normal service would have resumed
5
Service and food here has always been excellent. Love the Yakitori, you can order as little as 1 skewer to compliment the other dishes on the munu or just go for the 8 sticks yakitori that is on the menu
5
Food was great and this was only further helped by the great attitude and excellent customer service of Mr. Sam. Be sure to ask for him
5
Between the two of us, we sampled several terrific items. I ordered the Tomato Salad, Prawns, and Chicken Fried Rice, which was more than enough for one person. My girlfriend ordered the three-course meal and enjoyed the crab cakes, chicken entree, and frozen orange sorbet.Both the food and service were terrific. The restaurant was packed, and it was a Wednesday dinner, but the service did not suffer. Both our server Jina and the manager Vina checked back quite often.TIP: If you order the three-course meal, try the frozen orange sorbet souffle. It was far more tasty than I thought it would be. Also, we did not have reservations, as we just walked in to have dinner, and the service was still prompt and terrific
4
There is a great mix of foods available - suitable for vegetarians too. There was a bit of a mix up over serving tap and mineral water - my sister wanted one while I the other and they kept getting mixed up - but it was no great problem for us. When we asked for the dessert menu they brought us a complementary selection of desserts - the service had not been up to scratch they said
3
Heard many good comment from this restaurant,and by chance was invited to have dinner there from my group of high flyer friends.First impression of this place, Wow! very crowded at 7pm.look grand.Here come my critic on service and food,this place look so big and seem to run out of staffs,just for my drink,take more than half hour to be serve,don't even mention food.And if you order wines,be prepare to pour yourself,although the first pour is by them.Food look fantastic and taste not up to standard,and expensive in term of portion.Conclusion,if you really can spend all your time there,wait wait and wait... :
1
Our friend evening was just nice because of the people we were with but the service what to a local eatery standard. The business lunch was terrible. One hour to wait after the starter to get the main course. Bye-bye mezza 
5
Probably the best Sunday champagne brunch in Singapore with an outstanding variety of delicious food from several integrated kitchens in the same restaurant where the seafood bar is a must-have
4
The food is really not bad, the price is of upper range. But it is worth to visit if you have a special occasion. Dessert is beautiful done, delicious
5
This is so great that I want to go back to Singapore just to eat here again.We did the Sunday brunch which was out of this world. We also went back for lunch during the week and took my parents who can be difficult. Everyone was happy
3
Had a catch up lunch with a friend who is frequenter to the bar & brix. Food is exceptionally good but the staff & service can do with some training. E.g. I went there waiting at the front for a few minutes with no one bother to serve so i went to choose a seat. then i was ask to go to the front for assign seating! Not what you expect from Hyatt restaurant. Staff seems to be confuse with the menu and who can order. Definitely room for improvement there
4
Cozy restaurant with a good atmosphere and lots of nice private rooms you can book for dinner meetings. Great 3 course menu with lots of choices at a good price point. The deserts are to die for, try the Flowerpot or the Pavlowa
5
This is the best Sunday brunch I have ever experienced in Singapore. All the food was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. The champagne likewise, and the attentive waiters made sure the glasses were never left empty. In particular the sushi, the seafood and the 48 hour roasted beef was beyond imagination. Highly recommended
4
It seems that everything we ordered here were good specially the sea foods and they were cooked in an open kitchen. The sushi were very fresh and so delectable! Even the bread with it's tomato dipping is so delicious. Love it here
4
Settings is really nice, food is excellent with a lots of choices without being to overwhelming ( seafood buffet is specially yummy) the free flow champagne and wine is indeed flowing, my glass was refilled every sip I took !!!Service is nice, not super friendly but polite and efficient. it is not cheap but it is a good place for a noce and relaxing sunday brunch !!
5
Still my favorite brunch in Singapore !!!
So many choices from sashimi to burgers, food is great, like the place, OUTSTANDING

Upon entering, its atmosphere embraces you to feel excitement and culinary delights to come. MEZZA9 was conceptualized by Andreas Stalder- who introduced ‘a la minute’ cooking to Hyatt (food freshly prepared in show kitchens in front of diners) more than 20 years ago. This changed the dining scene, and a common feature today in the industry. Indeed a Family-Friendly Restaurant as many locals and tourists brought their children along. You would also experienced service of a certain Hyatt style. MEZZA9 offers a variety of cuisine- chinese, western, japanese & etc. Both times I went, it was enjoyable and the food was yummy! (Try ordering the grill platter)And the thing which attracted me to go back and again, would be the effort to organize a group to have happy birthday song re sang in tune of a trendy song.http://singapore.grand.hyatt.com/en/hotel/dining/mezza9.htmlEnjoy,Jason Han | Yummy We come! | http://jasonhanis.blogspot.s

I've come to Singapore for work for many years but always worked on the Sunday... hence aspiring to one day do the 'free flow champagne brunch'. Heading to one of the original and famous with a bunch of expats, I saw why they chose this brunch offering. Stunning array of food from the sushi/sashimi/japanese end through to seafood area with crab and freshly shucked oysters, to the hot food with the most divine 48hr cooked beef short ribs then a treat of baked truffled egg... the list just goes on. Top that off with artwork desserts, chocolate fountain, cheese and fruit, it's a pleasurable 'food coma' to be left in after numerous glasses of french bubbles and wines. Worth it! It was sometimes tough to get a drink refill or plate clear but the staff were very busy and doing a good job. ps - you need to book in advance for this Sunday brunch
5
Their Sunday brunch is excellent, with many food from around the world in display Buffett style. Probably one of the best in spore.
3
Great concept - perfect when you have guests from different backgrounds and you don't know their culinary preferences (eg. sushi/sashimi, yakitori, steak, Thai, 'Chinese', fresh seafood). Open kitchen layout so these guests can be entertained, as they can see and interact with the chefs. Execution, however, is second-rate; for every dish you can be sure that you will find many restaurants which can render a superior version. Many waiters, but service is not attentive
5
We visit the Mezza9 for the Sunday brunch and it was amazing. There is the biggest the selection of food that you ever will find. Sushi, Chinese, bbq, fish, meat, cheeses, desserts, fruits EVERYTHING! Name it and it will be there. I was so amazed from the food and also from the quality. I hit hard the sushi and the fish and oysters (all type of shellfish).The service was amazing everybody was friendly, polite and ready to assist you with everything.The top-up of the unlimited Champagne that was provided was flawless. I never saw my glass empty!I definitely recommend this brunch. Amazing
3
I liked everything about this place except the food. We ordered from the grill and my steak (US grain fed sirloin) was flavorless and chewy. My husband ordered the prime rib it was presented beautifully and the portion was huge....unfortunately, the flavor was blah. The side dishes were very good but the meat was below average. We love a good steak, but when I can cook a much better one at home for a lot less money....that is a problem. Service was inconsistent, for example, we had 3 different servers ask if we wanted more wine....YES please. But no one ever brought it. We had to flag down a server two or three times to finally get our wine. The wine selection was excellent. My favorites were available by the glass! The open kitchen concept makes for a beautiful ambiance and the vibe is relaxing and welcoming. The prices are reasonable considering you are in the most expensive and busiest area (corner of Orchard and Scott), so it is worth giving it a try. Maybe it was an off night at the grill
4
The restaurant has an open kitchen concept where you can see the cooks in action. You can order from their grill, seafood, japanese, chinese, dessert selection. The service is good and best value is to order their 3-course lunch/dinner menu
5
Service has always been excellent at Mezza9. The choice of wines and food selection is fantastic and there is always something that suits every diner. Very Friendly Smiley Staff. We are a fan of Mezza

My boyfriend and i went for sunday brunch on our last day in singapore, was recommended by a friend and was even better then expected we arrived at apx 11.30 and stayed until the end 4pm! (Our flight was not until 7pm haha) Literally evrysingle type of cruisine available, sushi& seafood, meats&bbq, noodles& rice, salads cold meats cheeses, sunday roast, deserts , even nitrogen icecream and you help yourself to as much as you want. We chose the option with unlimeted beer,wine,chapagne,bloody marys& mojitos and i dont thinkI had an empty glass once! And for little over £65/70 each an amazing deal!Best brunch ive ever had& great way to kill time after checkout before catching a late flight

Mezza9 is a special dining experience in Singapore. It's an upscale food court as it offers a wide variety of Western and Asian cuisine. I strongly recommend the Western grill dishes, both fish and meat. The grilling is made to order. The Asian dishes are superb, including local Singapore crab specialties as well as Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. The wine list is extensive and priced moderately as compared to other local fine dining restaurants. Service is excellent. Reservations are a must
2
We went for dinner without reservation and were treated as second class customers. We accepted to sit in one of the counters despite several table supposedly reserved being available. The menus came and took 15' for a waiter to take our orders. The oysters as starters never arrived and our drinks only came after complaining to reception manager after 30'. We were treated with complete lack of care and below any standards that you would expect inside a 'grand Hyatt. It is unfortunate as the food was of high quality but not worth for money.
4
Mezza9 very good. Too large a menu but in general well prepared and very tasty. Steak like butter. Wine across many countries, grapes and prices. Very relaxed and you would never seem to know that the tables are quite close. My only comment is the service, there was a lot of sour faces around. Slightly disappointing desert menu. I would go back especially to try the buffet.
5
This is a beautiful space. Offering nine different cuisines, they make dining interesting, entertaining, and unusual. We ordered blue crab cakes appetizer. ..a very generous portion with a lovely sauce, the cake is ball shaped and when opened is full of the dark meat with some white pieces mixed in. This could have been a main. The steamed seabass with ginger and scallions was excellent. ..Hong Kong style. We had the whole fish but you could order it filleted.The lentils were fantastic - rich, perfect texture, delicious. Grilled vegetables - excellent. Seafood fried noodles with gravy - large portion with baby bok choy cabbages, shrimp, asparagus. Yum!Salted caramel ice cream - a perfect ending. Service was very good and prices were as expected at a 5 star hotel.
4
Excellent Champagne Sunday Brunch one of the best in Singapore and only had one sitting so you are not rushed.There is great selection of different food stations and a good selection of cheeses.The dessert buffet is fabulous complete with chocolate fountain
4
Loved the decoration. Food was good, but being in a Grand Hyatt, it was rather pricey.This is the only place I could get some sushi
4
Made a lunch reservation at Mezza9 for my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary. Restaurant was packed when we arrived at 1pm and we were swiftly ushered to a table at a nice corner. Menu was quite extensive and we had problems deciding thus we were recommended the (very affordable) set lunch. Appetiser: Freshly baked bread with salsa - lovely! Starters: softshell crab salad and smoke salmon salad - excellent!! Mains: Cod Fish with fried rice (a letdown, both taste and presentation) and Wagyu burger (taste good but presentation wasn't impressive)Desserts: dessert of the day 'Frozen soufflé' (amazing!)My martini which I ordered (I love the martinis from Mezza9 bar) was complimentary and my husband had a delicious slice of cake and beautiful birthday song from the crew which were a surprise for us. Service was excellent and food was great. I had a fantastic time and would definitely visit again to try the other dishes as there are various stations (Jap, Chinese, Thai, etc) to choose from.
3
We had Sunday brunch there. The place is overcrowded. The tables are very near either to each other or to the food stations. There are constantly people walking behind your chair or you are bumping into another person while getting food. Food is a hit and miss. There are not enough starters apart from seafoods. Lamb and steak are very nice and tender. Chicken is a bit overcooked and tasteless. Egg benedictine and risotto are too far dry. Chinese station is very boring. Pak choi are nicely done but roast pork are too dry. There is quite a big selection of sushi and the sushi salad is very tastily. We also feel there is not enough salad or cooked vegetables.Most desserts are too heavy and too sweet but if you just eat in very small portion, it is very tasty. Service are very good but sometimes could not slow in putting away your dishes especially near the end of the brunch time.All in all, we are disappointed and will not go back again because of the atmosphere and disappointment in food
5
I have been there for many times as I frequently visit Singapore and I always stay at Grand Hyatt Hotel.Mezza9 is a restaurant with nice concept - Nine kitchens on Mezzanine floor. Another Mezza9 is opened at Grand Hyatt Macau which is also a nice restaurant.I had lunch this time and we ordered two set lunch plus an order of Blue Crab crabcake.The set lunch includes three courses - Salad / Roast or Market Fish of the day plus dessert.Food was fantastic and in particular the crabcake. This item is not available in set lunch menu (but as long as I remember, it appeared in the dinner set menu)
3
While the restaurant's ambiance is nice, the food is a hit or miss. My wife and I ordered the tom yum soup as an appetizer and it was very good. The soup was quite spicy, but that didn't deter us from finishing the bowl. If only we had left the restaurant after eating our soup...For our main course we ordered the seafood grill for two. It sounded delightful when reading it on the menu: lobster tail, crab legs, salmon, tuna and shrimp. Once it arrived at our table, we were not impressed by the small plate and lack of presentation. For around $140 SGD, we expected something a little more grandiose. While looks can often times be deceiving, this was unfortunately not the case. Everything was overcooked and lacked flavor with the exception of the salmon. The salmon was the only redeeming part of the meal. To say the least, we were quite disappointed with our meal and had higher expectations for such an esteemed restaurant. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing; I don't know. Regardless, we were both underwhelmed and will adventure out of our hotel, the Grand Hyatt, for our next meal
4
It was casual and the prices were reasonable. We each had two martinis and the bartenders knew how to make a yummy drink! I will have to come back and try the crab cakes!

Don't make the same mistake as I did and expect passable Japanese food at a place which also serves Chinese food? I am a huge sushi fan and can appreciate conveyor belt sushi just as much as high end omakase the world over. The sushi I had at Mezza9 was really sub standard, far worse than any fast food sushi I have ever had. It's possible that the standards for Japanese food in Singapore are really low but I doubt it. Small pieces of fish did not taste particularly fresh and the yakitori was OK but served with something closer to sate sauce. All in all one of my worst Japanese dining experiences ever. Then the check comes... I have no problem paying top dollar for good sushi, but this was bottom bottom sushi and top price. Over SGD80 for simple and very underwhelming sushi set and two pieces of yakitori. Would never consider coming back to this place.

For a lover of champagne brunches this one was just ok for me. The venue is too big and too crowded. The tables are placed so close together you almost feel like you are in a communal dining hall. It is impossible to have quiet conversation and you can hear everything everyone around you is saying. The champagne was Perrier-Jouet and after a slow start the staff were very generous with the pouring. The food stations were really spread out. The seafood selection was good. The carvery was average. They had a Chinese section and a Japanese section tucked away at the back which I almost missed. The egg bar had benedicts and florentine in hot dishes which looked awful. I ordered a cheese and mushroom omelette which was inedible. The Sunday brunch market in Singapore is very competitive. This one did not live up to expectations

Service sucks big time, found a hair in main course. Regret I didnt snapped a pic of it....Was served with chipped glass. Service delayed, when food( due to 2inch long hair in the food) and drink ( chipped glass thought of ignore it at first but after seeing the hair I had to point that out too. )taken away, no explanation was given but had to wait. ...just imagine we were there from 7.45pm and left at 10.30pm, had 3 course dinner, so i shant go further into its details as it will gets too lengthy.looking back its Laughable ....coming from a 5 stars hotel standard . The best part and my advice ladies... if you are planning to head there with a male companion, be it client or friends please don't call for the bill because they will assume you are paying for the entire meal.They are too sophisticated ( dull, or shallow, not sharp, or plain lazy ) to approach and present the bill with sensitive ...to just present and say 'thank you very much and here is the bill " then take the lead from the reaction of the customer body language and see who make an effort to reach for it.My Goahh...even the manager re-confirms its, for them its a common practice, since they don't assume that all man would pay for it. That's is very considerate ...But then again why assumed that only the person calls for the bill are the ones that would foot the bill!!!! Staff dart back and forth across the room, easily your call would go unheard/unnoticed.So what do you do if you want to leave in a hurry and desperately wants to have them bring over the bill.I would suggest you go personally to cashier and point to them the person the paymaster of the day.So to summed it up I had the most unpleasant, evening there. Initially i was raving about it to my guest because he couldn't decide what kind of food and he doesnt speaks english and thought, mezzanine would be an excellent choice but to my horror i left there feeling sore, bitter and totally disappointed that he even the person in charge had to take the gender difference as a better way of explaining the situation. Wonder if he would give me a better version of their practice if its all ladies in table or had wore a pant.tsk...tsk ...really I don't get it . I have fine dine but this is utterly the most lame excuse that I have heard by far and to back it by a floor manage/d maître . What is service if you kept making assumption, don't assume just ask ...well i am not here to teach them their job but whoever reads this pls enlightened if I am wron

My wife and I popped in for lunch at Mezza9 situated at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Singapore. We had made online reservations on the previous day. We also had a $50 gift voucher to spend.AmbienceThe restaurant looked impressive. The waiters were busy darting about attending to customers, the lights were dimmed and there was smooth lounge music in the background. However, to maximize the space in restaurant, the seats were placed close together. As a result, we felt a bit cramped and we could clearly hear the conversations from the next table.Waiters/Waitresses The staff made a number of blunders. First, our fruit juices came 35 minutes after we had ordered them. They had forgotten to make them. I had to remind the waiters. When they finally, came, no apology was offered.Our juices were supposed to be a concoction of apple, pineapple, lime, mint and vanilla. My wife and I, however, did not notice any vanilla flavour at all. When we informed the waiter, he apologized and remarked that he would inform the person who made the drink.The were a number of occasions when food was wrongly delivered to us and to the person sitting at the next table. In fact, the person next to us even got his bill before his dessert!The waiters don't seem to have product knowledge about the food they served. This is alarming for an 'award winning' restaurant as mentioned in their website.When we arrived at the restaurant, we presented our voucher to the waiter, who took it away. But when we got our bill, the amount of $50 from our voucher was not deducted. So we had to tell them to correct it. Then a waitress returned and announced that our bill had been fully settled. We explained to her that could not be the case. In the end, after a couple more hasty attempts, they got it right with the appropriate deduction made.FoodThe bread that was served with a dip when we arrived was great; crusty on top and soft inside, and very fresh.We had the lobster set (Chinese style) as our main course. The lobster was fresh and springy although bland by itself, and the black bean-cum-shrimp paste that was added to it was overpowering and much too salty.The vegetable dish (Kai Lan - Chinese broccoli) that came with the lobster was plain and ordinary. The soup that accompanied the dish however, was very good, comprising soft bean curd, crunchy black fungus, tomato and egg. The rice was fried instead of plain and didn't go well with the overpowering black paste. Overall, the set was disappointing.As for dessert, my wife found the green tea pudding delicious by itself. I found the flavour of the green tea too strong; both of us thought it was better without the strawberry jam that covered it.Coffee and tea was served as part of the set. My coffee was too strong and I had to ask them to add more hot water to dilute it.Final WordsAfter we left the restaurant, I received a phone text message from the restaurant thanking me for my patronage. Well, that does not change the impression the staff left on us. The waiters quickly attend to the customers but in their haste, mistakes were made. Will we go back again? I doubt it
3
So 7 of us arrived for dinner and most of us opted for the 3-course $80 set dinner. Before that, bread was served and it was ok, nothing fancy. My 1st course was the Caesar salad and it was a small portion, which suited me fine, but probably disappointing for big eaters. Others had the seafood platter and smoked salmon which were equally small in portionsMy main of steamed seabass was decidedly a disappointment. A sliver of seabass with 5 strands of vegetables and a wallop of rice. I don't even eat the latter 2 as it's not restaurant food per se. Small serving, poor presentation and low class ingredientsMy friends had the lamb chops which look better. Another ordered the a la carte steak which seemed ok but at $68, you're probably better off in a steak houseMy cheese platter was also somewhat disappointing with 3 pieces of cheese but at least they had the blue. My friend's molten cake dessert looked much betterSo overall, I have to give this an average rating as some of friend's dishes look ok, while mine sucked. It's like a gamble here, which is not grea
5
This is the real deal.Highly professional service with top quality free flow wines and champagne.The array of food is spectacular with fabulous roast beef,great sushi and great fun desserts.This is really the best I have had in Singapore and the most professional set up by a mile.The only caveat is do go early as it really does get very busy bu then it is a good atmosphere with plenty of happy customers.Top marks every time

My 13 year old son and I visited Mezza9 at the recommendation of my brother. We were told to sit in the Chinese bar and watch Chef Lee work his magic. After introducing ourselves to Chef Lee, we were thoroughly spoiled by him and his staff. I started with the best lychee martini ever and moved on to a glass of wine. One by one, the delicious meals started arriving - salad, chicken broth soup with beautiful fresh veggies, soft shell crab with green mango, crispy fried local fish in sauce, fried rice with chicken, salted fish and eggs and stir fried veggies. It was absolutely sumptious. Before we left he sent us complimentary sorbet. All in all, it was the amazing dinnerl in Singapore, made even more special by the superb attention from Chef Lee. Can't wait to visit Mezza9 with my husband in the summer
5
Such a pleasant experience, to dine at mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt Singapore! In a city that is a true melting pot of all people and cultures, it is welcoming to see a restaurant that covers the globe: in ingredients, menus and impeccable service. A clever play on words, you take opne flight up to the mezzanine floor and then immerse yourself in some of the finest pan-Asian and European cuisines. A worthwhile excursion, great ambiance and superb presentation of this world cuisine

My husband and I had a fabulous dinner at Mezza9 last month.We were staying at Goodwood Park Hotel, so it was a very convenient walk, especially after 2 disastrous taxi rides to various other restaurants.The area we were sitting in, was interment and fairly quiet.We had been in Penang and then a few days in Singapore and would have to say, they made the best martinis the whole time away.Wonderful selection of foods, service spot on and a great atmosphere.We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and after our dinner, the staff presented us with a beautiful cake. Yum.Many thanks to James and Sam who look after us so professionally.Can't wait until next year when we can dine at Mezza9 again.Well done
5
I have been coming to this restaurant since opening several years ago and have never been disappointed at any time, great decor, fantastic ambience, delicious food and superb service.... Cannot get better. The different areas within the restaurant create a different experience every time you go there. The staff are efficient, know their stuff and are great hosts.... Fabulous
2
Ive been here couple of times before and now it's really not good. Staff has been changed, food quality changed, smell in Sushi area. Terrible now. Maybe after the certificate of excellence they r becoming too lazy..
5
Had a business/social lunch with a friend who's also a business associate. She had recommended Mezza9 for our lunch spot, given their range of cuisines and a very good set lunch menu. Indeed, the set lunch menu has the most number of dishes to choose from. Personally, I've never seen set menus with this many choices, and they cover every cuisine too -- from Western to Chinese, Thai to Jap. A 2-course set costs just $29++, which I think is great value.Service was good and attentive, with the exception of a couple of sour-faced waitresses I noted trudging around sullenly. Then there was this one waitress who was very nice, but spoke absolutely too fast when going through the whole list of daily specials. It was like she had memorized the list by heart and she wanted to get it all out before she forgot anything. But then that meant I couldn't catch half of what she had said. Food was great. Roasted lamb leg was very juicy and tender. The roast chicken my associate had was tender too, but a little dry and coarse. All in all, it was a nice experience at Mezza9 for a weekday business lunch
4
The concept is different cuisines within one restaurant. So choose between sushi/sashimi, grill (Australian steak/New Zealand lamb), Chinese wok and simmered dishes, Thai food, etc. Although it sounds as if it might suffer from a "jack of all trades" problem, it doesn't. Really good food: excellent sushi and Thai taster plate on this occasion. Service is attentive. It is not cheap and for an expensive place the large size and close tables can feel a bit impersonal. Nevertheless a really nice place for a special occasion.
5
Best sushi and best noodles with seafood. Great Lobster soup and good value for money.Nice atmospher...To be done!!
5
Had a great meal consisting of of crab cake starters and the sushi platter. Food was of great quality and reasonably priced (for singapore
5
My girlfriend and I had many experiences with brunches and we are traveling a lot, but this Sunday brunch just stunned us. The choice is outstanding, the wood is amazing, service is great and it is great value for money. The buffet just never seems to end when you think you explored all of it you find another corner with a separate buffet. We enjoyed it and will be definitely back if we are again in Singapore
5
On a Sunday night, our party of eight enjoyed a superb dinner here. Our modus operandi was slighly unconventional, one of our group (a regular here) chose a combination of hors d'oeuvre and then individually we selected entrees, all of which was put on the Chinese style turntable of our round table. I have to say that nothing was disappointing, quite the opposite in fact - well-presented and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the pomelo salad and lamb chops, all nicely washed down with Chassagne Montrachet. Dessert was mango and sticky rice.Service was consistently excellent and attentive throughout. This restaurant is well worth visiting for special occasions, in our case to celebrate the engagement of a young couple. Top marks indeed 
4
Came here for dinner with the family a few weeks ago. The service was excellent, although the topping up of wine could have been done with a bit more attention and frequency. Food was superb, and there's a nice range that more or less caters to most tastes -we had Japanese and Western food, all of which were superb. Dessert was easily the highlight of the dinner -remember to try the crepes
4
Went there last week early Valentine celebration. We order the 3 course set dinner and the food was very good. However, we waited quite some time between appetizers and main course. Nonetheless, the service was good and would definitely recommend this place to my friends
5
Best crab cakes in town! Full of tasty crab meat, firm, fried to perfection, served with the delicious remoulade sauce. A must when dining in Mezza9 in Singapore!
5
Christmas Brunch was excellent! Great choice of traditional dishes and so much more. Service was first class.
5
After I read most of the reviews on trip advisor, before visiting Mezza9, I thought it was a buffet. Don't be fooled, it's not a buffet and it's menu style. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with veggies and roasted potatoes, when I got my meal, I wanted to change the order to get mashed potatoes instead of roasted potatoes. The waiter was more than happy to change my order instantly, and didn't charge me. That was very nice and it made me really happy. My husband ordered a California Roll (so good), and a mixed fish platter and a passion fruit drink with no alcohol. Excellent choices. We really enjoyed our food, the atmosphere was nice. Very quick service, the start bread was excellent. The sushi was excellent (we got California Roll). Picture attached. Overall, it was one of our top two favorite restaurants in Singapore during our 4-day visit. I definitely recommend everyone tries this place! Plus it was GREATTTTT locations!! on Orchard Road, after eating, you can SHOP!! ENJOY

Went here for our last (sun)day in Singapore. We were a group of ten, but everyone was well taken care of by the staff the whole time. Our glasses were always full and the food was fabulous. I didn't really expect anything since I'm not usually a fan of the buffet set up, but this truly was an amazing experience. The selection of food was unlimited and the wines included were some of my favourites. All in all one of the best restaurant experiences I've had

Its our traditional new year's family brunch and this year we have decided to go to the famous brunch of Mezza 9 and it is certainly impressive ! Wide variety of dishes available from the different 'stations' that ranges from Thai to Grill, Chinese Japanese, seafood and my favorite the dessert !The ambience was jovial and festive, which makes it a truly enjoyable experience. The service was fast , the staff came constantly to clear our empty dishes and the managers came regularly to wish us a happy new year. Really enjoyed this day

As a loyal guest, at the end of the day when work is done and you don't really feel like going out or even when the Singapore's weather is not too friendly, there's no other place to have good food, good drinks and good atmosphere like Hyatt's own Mezza9 Restaurant. I always see smiles on Mezza-Team's faces when guest arrives. We always feel welcomed and belonged here. The servers knows the products well. Very well trained obviously. Food varieties are amazing. From Thai, Chinese, Japanese to Western. The Chef is the soul of the restaurant, so its nice to see a restaurant's Chef like Martin Scholz make time to see if guests are enjoying their dinner. Guests seems to trust the quality of Japanese sushi and sashimi as they are also my fav food. The grilled section, meats prepared nicely. Sunday Brunch, its always full and its worth going. Team leaders like managers Massimo, Sebastian and Vinayaka makes guests dining experience more enjoyable

I went to Mezza 9 to celebrate the festive season with my colleagues. The experience was truly amazing. We were greeted by friendly staff, service was exceptional. I was very impressed with the high quality of the food and nice ambience. The menu offers a wide choice of cuisine to suit your culinary taste – Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Western. Food was well presented. My wagyu ribeye steak was cooked to perfection and melts in the mouth.The restaurant features an open kitchen concept and I enjoyed watching the chefs busy at work.  It is an ideal place for a business lunch and friends get-together. It truly deserves a 5-star rating. I will definitely go back soon

Being a solo business traveller, I am always looking for places that don't make me feel out of place. This is a very large restaurant (400 seats), but somehow the Hyatt have got it right as seating is quite varied and you don't really feel like you are part of a mass crowd. The menu is quite varied (many cultures available) and reasonably piced. The service is excellent and with all of the people there, the staff still find the time to be friendly and very courteous. The ambience of the place is nice and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience
3
We tried Mezza9 for Sunday Brunch on 15 December 2014. We usually go to the Fullerton for brunch and thought we would give this a try after a few recommendations. The restaurant is very dark, the kids room, well actually you cant even call it that its a box with nothing in other than crayons and colouring paper. The food was average and the freeflow aspect of the meal was ok although there was a little reluctance to top up the glasses before it finished. On the whole it was fairly average and for the brunch officinados amongst us you will be hard pushed to get a better brunch in Singapore than the Fullerton. I would suggest that someone from the food & beverage department take a trip down to both the Fullerton and Mandarin Oriental to check out the kids rooms. As everyone knows happy kids make happy mums and dads and the Hyatt completely missed a trick with this
5
Book a table and bring your friends! The buffet was extensive and high quality - sushi, chinese, western-style, dessert, etc etc. And they are prompt in topping up your glass of French champagne. Best value for the money in Singapore
5
I ate here last week with colleagues and I absolutely enjoyed the buzz throughout the restaurant. While it is a large restaurant the seating is pocketed to offer a more intimate environment. There are food displays of every type throughout the restaurant and the glass wine vault was very tempting. The menu offers something for everyone, including a terrific bento box style lunch which my colleagues enjoyed. I chose the salmon set lunch which came with a choice of sauces & sides. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the grilled veggies were outstanding. I definitely recommend visiting, but call ahead
5
Beautiful restaurant with various choices from different countries. If you are in Singapore for a few days, let's try one country for each day. They have Japanese, Thai, Chinese and Western 's food. Seafood like fish, crab, shrimp is fresh and delicious. This's also great restaurant for wine lovers. The service is by far the best. Will be bac

we had the dinner set menu and were amazed about the quality (seafood) of the place - friendly staff in a nice environmennt ! we will return!
4
Had a great meal with great service .a really nice concept considering it's been around for a long time. Fresh food displays , loved the wine cabinets Arrived and it was empty and after an hour not a spare seat in the place . Definitely will retur
5
There was nothing about this dining experience that was not enjoyable from the pineapple martini's to the crab cake entree to the sashimi platter, soft shell crab and perfectly cooked lamb.For a hotel restaurant this place is a standout.Will definitely be back when next in Singapore
5
Sunday Brunch is really a great experience. Top quality food throughout. Shellfish, lobster and crab are particularly good. Japanese, Chinese and Malay dishes all feature. Traditional British Sunday roasts were complimented with Yorkshire puddings and rich delicious gravy. Save room for desserts, you will not want to miss the Tiramisu.Laurent Perrier champagne and Cloudy Bay sauvingnon blanc identify the excellent level of wines included in the price. Pricey but give it a go, you will not eat dinner later anyway
4
The Good =)~9 different cuisines you can order from.~Open kitchen concept,Interesting to see your food being prepared.The Bad =(~Expensive.~For men, no short pants allowed, only formal dressing allowed.My Tip for future visits:~Try not to sit near the glass window, its distracting having many people walking past you :
4
This is the best Martini bar in town. The choice is huge and the Martinis are delicious. We went there with in total 6 pax on a Thursday evening. The staff was very friendly and fast. The food was OK, which is sufficient given the outstanding Martinis
3
Variety of menu items is a big plus. Japanese, thai, chinese and western food. Service was excellent. Spacious and bright restaurant with different seating options.House pour wines good quality and not too expensive. Only issue I had was that all my food, including my starter, main and side dishes was served cold or Luke warm at best. So make sure you tell them you want hot food when you order!Not cheap, as you'd expect at a hotel restaurant. However if you have the Hyatt dining card it's really good value
5
The Mezza9 at Hyatt its a great experience in every aspect. pretty well designed and the food was absolutely fantastic. I like the choice of all the different kitchen styles and together with the great chef Beer it's harmony guaranteed. Chef Beer is a unique chef in unique restaurant 
5
My wife had half a chicken and I had a steak that melted in my mouth. A cake was also a surprise for a special occasion.
5
I really enjoyed my dinner at Mezza9. Casual atmosphere combined with high quality food and efficient service..
5
LOVE LOVE LOVE the brunch at Mezza9, have been going here for many years now and its is our favourite brunch destination. The only downside is that the restaurant is quite dark but dont let that put you off as the food quality is excellent.. well worth a tri

I like the outside seating, the huts and kind of 'away from town' feeling but i felt there were quite a few mosquitoes due to the water and greenery they had maintaine
4
Dinner started with cold crab legs, nice cuts of tuna salmon sashimi and carrot soup.Main was one and half Maine grilled lobster butter herb sauce which came out rather smallish. 400g chargrilled crab legs very nice. Grilled tiger prawns. Chinese style butter prawns not on the menu but chef happy to oblige. Thailand glass middle salad extra hot with chilli padi. Beef crispy noodles egg gravy Cantonese style.No liquor. Total was SGD560 for 3 diners
5
A friend had recommended the Sunday buffet so we had booked in advance before I left Australia. Incredibly they rang to confirm before we left which was very impressive. The Sunday buffet was sensational and I probably drank my $ worth in champagne alone!! The staff were attentive and my glass was never empty.We returned several days later with my parents for lunch. The price was very reasonable and my parent declared it the best meal they had while in Singapore. I also need to mention that I received a message after the brunch thanking me for my patronage- nice touch Mezza9!
4
Amazing selection of food- from roast dinner, to chinese, to sushi, to seafood with good desserts too (who doesn't look a chocolate fountain). All of the food very good quality and obviously freshly done- you can see them cooking it in front of you. It does set you back though. About 80 pounds per person including unlimited champagne. About 70 pounds per persons not drinking. Would definitely suggest arriving early (around 12:00) and making them most of the all you can eat aspect- I had about 5 main courses! You will need to boo

Visit http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/08/mezza9-grand-hyatt-thai-street-food.html for moreThe meal began with a complimentary bread with the perfect S-shape curve. Served with a tomato relish instead of butter, it has such a fluffy interior that one can take an afternoon nap on it. Since it was a limited promotion, we decided to try the Tasting Platter of Thai Street Food. These dishes certainly looked like what you remembered of Thai cuisine, but with a whimsical twist. An example would be the Moo Yang-a dish of char grilled pork belly served on satay sticks on a bed of slightly undercooked Thai jasmine rice. While the pork juices and the honey herb marinade drooled onto the grains and made the dish a little oily, I put our reservations aside and dig in deep. The dish was so flavourful that I would be happy with just a bowl of that same fragrant rice and pork belly.But there are other interesting offerings such as Sei Kua, an indigenous fusion of Thai curries and western sausages. Instead of meat, glutinous rice takes the driver's seat in the sausage casing. It is drenched with a dry thick red curry with pork that was competently sweet.  The Baby Octopus was slightly chewy and rubbery, but its chilli sauces are unapologetically strong. The tongue starts burning from the chilli padi the more I chew into it but luckily, there were some cabbage slices to provide temporary heat relief. Meanwhile, there is also familiar classics like the traditional crispy thai fishcake. This is safe for those who are not adapted to chilli, as it has been masked by a transparent sweet thai dressing with sprinkles of peanuts. But nothing could beat the large and succulent spencer gulf prawns that have been lightly breaded and deep fried. The coconut could not be detected but it was so fresh that we had no problems demolishing them.Don't forget to spoon the speckles of garlic, green and red chilli padi on the prawn before putting everything into the mouth. These potent spices warm the belly in seconds. Just like the prawns which were Sustainable Seafood Movement, the Fish of the Day (price subjected to vary) features any fish that are caught on that day. We had the Drum fish, which has a moist and not-too-flaky texture. Dusted with black specks of olives and tomatoes, the al-dente penne pasta are a comfortable match to the fish. By then, we were pretty stuffed but marched off bravely to conquer the dessert platter. We were usually loyal fans of milky chocolate ice cream rather than sour apricot or raspberry sherbet. But it is the red and yellow granite balls that added sparkle to the rich caramel molten chocolate cake. The icy sensation melts into tart juices that brings everything alive, including the banana crepe with that is super crispy but rather hollow on the inside. Meanwhile, though the sourishness of the baked figs on puff pastry made one's face pucker unknowingly, it was nice balance to the sweet vanilla Creme custard sauce. Whether it's main courses or desserts, Mezze9 delivers. And even though it is a 5-star restaurant, its set lunches are reasonably priced at $29 for 2 course and $39 for 3 course from Monday-Saturday. What's even more attractive for me is the flexibility to choose starter-main/main-dessert.   With that in mind, I have plenty of solid good reasons to come back again.

Went with kids. Furthest table in the room from anything, and under a freezing cold air con unit.Table 4 of us ate $410, no puddings, but wine.Food was good, tasty, things we'd eaten elsewhere. all cooked and presented well. but sadly not a great choice for our vegetarian.Mixture of sushi/ sashimi, Thai, all excellently prepared
5
great for sashimi/sushi or stirfry hot from the woktry the spring rolls, a rich treat.staff and ambiance fantastic. wine list very good.long serving chef keeps all ship-shape
5
Restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient. Very impressive with food to match. A great range of food styles and all first rate. Service is attentive without being over the top and no pressure felt to leave once the meal is over.
4
The food is wonderful, as is the ambiance. The prices are a little high, especially compared to the great food you can get at surrounding food courts. But if you're there for a business lunch, it's a perfect setting.

The best Sunday Champagne Brunch in Singapore!
We have tried many others but always come back to Mezza 9 at The Hyatt.
Great food selection and yummy free flow Perrier-Jouet Champagne.
Always lots of fun.
A must.

We were at Mezza9 to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was really an exciting culinary experience. The place is super scenic in terms of design - realized by Japanese firm Super-Potato - it includes nine different food stations: thai, sushi, yakitori, grill, steam, deli, patisserie etc. and you can order from all the different area. So it is, at the same time, the ideal place for an eclectic asian dining experience and a spot suitable if you need to comply a party of people with various culinary tastes! We were six people, everyone tasted different kitchens and we all were completely satisfied and enthusiast with the dinner. Plus Sous Chef Ms. Cindy Low was a terrific host as she escorted us through the various stations, suggesting the best plates for each area. At the end of the dinner she also kindly served a sample of complimentary dessert that we really appreciated. So, we really recommend mezza9 to experience the diverse asian culinary in just one spot

It seems that memories make an experience better. I hadn't eaten at Mezza9 for many years and I always had such nice memories of it. Perhaps it was youth or being in a new city, but last night Mezza9 was mediocre at best. Vietnamese Spring Rolls were filled with dry duck and the dipping sauce was made with apple cider vinegar which was very odd. Peanuts were sort of dumped on top of the rolls. Ate it because I didn't want to appear rude to the person that took me there, but in the end had to take out the duck. My main was fine, the vegetables were sort of stewed capsicum and onions that had been doused in balsamic. I suspect, the "roasted" potatoes were actually thrown in a fryer before serving to make them hot and crispy, but all it did was make them mushy and greasy. Not a pleasant food experience. Full of tourists. A cafeteria for Orange County Californians transplanted to Singapore. Ugh
5
This is one of my favorite restaurants for casual but elegant dining – you can stop with the kids for lunch after a morning of shopping or with your loved one just before a night at the theater. The restaurant was introduced a few years back and it was an instant hit with me and the family. Effectively what you get is 9 different food concepts all in one place – the best of the East and the West kind of thing. So if the family cannot decide on what to eat or if you are not sure what you fancy then this is the place to go. In our case my wife loves Chinese food, I like Sashimi and our son enjoys a steak and this is the only place I know where we can get it all on the same table. The quality of the food is excellent and the staff are efficient and friendly.The restaurant may be a tad expensive for some but I believe it is good value for money. If you are watching the pennies then check out their set meals – this is the most affordable option and there is something for everyone. You can get a set meal for around US$ 28 excluding drinks service charge and tax The restaurant gets very busy throughout the weekends and during lunch on weekdays as it is a favorite for business lunches so it is worthwhile phoning ahead and making a bookin
5
If you have a day to spend for Brunch in Singapore this is the place to go, anything and everything that may trigger your taste pallet is at this location , but do not go if you do not have the time and make sure you have a reservation.The seafood is high on the list, the asian food comes as a good second, who needs the cooked food, it is too much after all the seafood
4
If you’re looking for luxury and really love champagne and seafood, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Incredible all-you-can-eat buffet in terms of oysters, lobster, sushi + other fresh seafood (also reasonable French cheese etc.). Unfortunately, the cooked food – from roast dinner reminiscent of British school food, dry Peking duck, evil Western-style puddings – leaves a lot to be desired. I was very impressed the first time I came here by the sheer atmosphere and the things they do well, but disappointed the second time. It’s worth knowing that the champagne brunch also includes wine and cocktails (e.g. Mojito), if you want to mix things up a bit. A must for champagne/seafood lovers who can afford a special experience, but imho not worth the pretty exorbitant price otherwise
5
Always best for a stop-over in Asia for a Swiss guy to enjoy the real Swiss stuff after so many days of asian food. It starts with open-pit kitchen - Grill, Steamer, Japanese, dessertbuffet etc - all this makes you hungry while walking through. Warm and busy atmosphere, comfortable chairs, speedy and up-to date staff with a smile in their face. Bar and cigar Lounge ensuite - perfect to switch after dinner. Brunch is outstanding and it is easy to get in contact with the Singapore residents - a lot of Perrier Jouet Champagne. Top: Chef is always between the tables to talk to the clients. Perfect, swiss coolness...
3
Went to Mezza9 a few times. Always just have the bento lunch and chinese set lunch with the lobster. And always with a yakitori platter as well. More than enough for two people. Service is quick and prompt. Atmosphere is very sleek and professional.Food is average. Not the best place if you are really into good food. But for a nice lunch date for some good natter, it's a perfect venue
5
Wow! Still a great dining experience after leading the pack for 15 years. The place was rockin! We had a great time choosing new interpretations of old favorites. Best selection in town. Staff proud, intelligent, helpful and knowledgeable.
3
Let's start with the negatives. We had a party of 11. 3 orders of main course did not arrive until all the others were done eating. We kept asking about the orders and the waiters kept saying 'will be here soon'. We also had a small cockroach crawling on our table when the 1st few orders arrived. The manager was very apologetic and tried his very best to make it up to us. He seemed genuine about making sure these wont happen again. Our main server was personable. Some others were inattentive, for instance, my request for warm water was forgotten. The food was not as good as i remembered - in fact quite ordinary. Of the many dishes that i tried, the chinese food is quite good and the dessert (not the apple dessert) was great.
5
Absolutely fabulous restaurant !They where the pioneer in the concept and keep maintaining amazing standards in everything, food , service ..ambiance ...before your meal , do go and have your aperitif at the Martini Bar .One of the best Sunday's brunch as well 
5
We have been to many champagne brunches in Singapore and this is one of the best. Our champagne glasses were never empty and the selection of food of all varieties was excellent. I particularly loved the Sushi and Sashimi station and could have kept going back all day, but had to try other dishes and they were all very tasty and fresh. Oysters were shucked as you waited. Meats, vegetables and salads were thoroughly enjoyed. The only disappointment was the cheese selection which was very meager.
4
Had a business dinner here one night, and the food was great. I shared the meat platter with a colleague, and we barely finished it. The desserts were the best part. We had a private room in the wine room. Ask for this....it's quiet, and a fun place to eat
5
The Mezza 9 is simply the best restaurant in Singapore, the culinary team is outstanding, full choices from Japanese, Western, Thai, Chinese, SeaFood, Deserts, you name it , the restaurant will bring the best of the best to your table. The Service is outstanding and the best waiter in Singapore, Ravi works and provide the remarkable services to the lucky one who will be seating on his section.The best brunch is town without a doubt, abundance of choices, great services and more than generou selection of beverage packages... you will have the perfect Sunday you aways longed for...You will be so pampered and be the loyal ambassador to Mezza9 as I have been for over 15 years.. Enjoy
5
Sunday Lunch at the Hyatt, 4 adults and 3 children (2-4 years old). (Children under 7 are free, adults are about $180 pp...but worth it)Has the wow factor as you enter, atmosphere was great, service was polished, and the amount of food on offer is amazing. Japanese section, Chinese, Seafood, cheeses and breads, meat and dessert.Beer, wine and some cocktails are included in the price.Was told that this is one of the best buffet lunches in Singapore, and I can't argue that. Very impressed, and very full.Book as far a head a time as possible
5
Local friends questioned the judgment of the other local friends who suggested this place, when there are so many free-standing restaurants (not part of hotels) in town. But it was an inspired choice, as long as you don't freeze up when confronted with lots of choice! The menu allows each person at your table to have a different cuisine, with wines to bridge all tastes. Quantities are perhaps unnecessarily large in some cases, such as the lobster in spicy noodles, but sharing is a fun tradition in Asia. We understand this place has entered the annals of a Singapore tradition, and with good reason. Globalization is complete with the Swiss chef. We look forward to returning
4
Good food, excellent variety of Asian, Western and fusion dishes. Very reasonably priced wines and service with a smile, although most waiters suffer from CWD. This 'Chronic Waiters Disease' is a wide-spread condition to be experienced all over the world. It makes waiters look in the other direction whenever they have a feeling a customer likes to have their attention
5
We happened into Mezza9 because it was close to our hotel. It was such wonderful food and pleasant service we chose to eat there the 4 nights we were in the city. Tango was our waiter and he went out of his way to make our dinners the best part of our days! He helped us make selections and suggested we let the chef choose for us on our last night and it was beyond our expectations. He prepared a Lobster Thermidor unlike anything we had ever tasted. It was delightful to watch the food preparation in the grill, the patisserie, and the seafood area. All the staff were friendly and helpful and genuinely eager to please! Outstanding in every way
4
Was a fixed menu for work. Had a lot of great tasty bites. Loved the lamb chops. The presentation of each course was great.
5
Eating in Singapore can get you jaded as each restaurant seems amazing, and yet this dining experience rises above. They have several kitchens catering to all foodies or dietary restrictions. The quality and presentation are simply amazing. Seafood quality is beyond description.
5
Good choice of food available for selection.
Service was good.
Price was reasonable. It will be helpfull if parking is complemnetary.
5
My wife is a vegetarian and they made special dishes to accommodate her. The staff was very courteous and service was excellent
4
Went for a large brunch with friends it was nice good array of food wasn't the best value for money, u have to out of Sing for that unfortunately
5
We used to live in Singapore and tried quite a few different champagne brunches, now we go back for work sometimes and we wanted to give the Mezza9 perriet jouet brunch a go 7 years on. We loved it. The choice of food was amazing and so varied and it was great to have such a good quality champagne as an option. Only 2 tiny things, shame there is no kajiki sashimi, and also the champagne stopped pouring quite a bit before the end of the session as the staff in our area started laying up for the evening, where tables round the corner were still being served. Other than that we would never need to go anywhere else for brunch!
4
I had a private dinner in Mezza9 for 16 pax. The service was great. Treated like a king. The dishes were worthy of awards, with a perfect blend of flavors and sweet and sour. The chef and servers made successful attempts to make the dishes as intimate as the company I dined with. The place itself after its facelift looks classy and elegant and I was given a tour of the place. I won't mind dining here for special and exclusive dinners
5
I actually went to the martini bar at mezza9 in grand Hyatt Singapore after my dinner with a few colleagues. Clients left so I had time for a drink before heading back to another hotel. I tried the lychee Martini which was recommended and it was very good. Then I saw some people flashing their hand phones at the staff so I asked what was that about and was told their Facebook page had some Monday Martini promotion so I immediately looked for their Facebook page and got a free martini! Oh and I had a some more tidbits we ate some crab cakes it was huge and fresh and delicious you can see the crab! So I had 2 martinis in the end
5
I booked a private room for a business lunch. Wow what an experience the private room came with a dining table and a private sofa area as well. The food as usual was fantastic off the menu and a huge variety between western, Japanese, thai and Chinese. The service was exceptional as well. Great job to all at Mezza 9 keep up the good work
3
My wife and I went to Mezza9 for a late dinner. We were greeted by a hostess who asked if we had a reservation. When I said no, she seemed quite put out and said that she would see what she could do. (Maybe she is the one another reviewer called, 'snooty'). We were seated near an open kitchen at a tiny two-top that was inches from our neighbors. It was so hot and noisy from the kitchen that we were about to leave when a waiter asked us what was wrong. We said we didn't like the table but understood that they were quite full so we would go somewhere else. Jumping to action at the suggestion, he led us to large, quiet table near the sushi-bar which was perfect. It felt like a different restaurant. I had 5 very good oysters and a starter and my wife had a 3-course set and our bill was about $150 plus wine. Not good value for money but it is a diverse menu with fresh ingredients and careful preparation
1
Priced beyond your wildest dreams. A snooty attitude combined with a selective dress code that applies for some and not others. We left.
5
The multi-cultural selection for breakfast is unbelievable! If you are staying for several days, try to pace yourself and select a few countries each morning.
Dinners in Mezza9 are excellent, especially if you like fresh fish and seafood.
4
A good selection of fine food covering different cuisines so you can eat your way around the world. Terrific quality, carefully presented, all fresh and top notch. Service was smooth and unobtrusive, very, very good. Kept the champagne glasses topped up. Good for all ages and tastes. Tasty Japanese yakitori and fresh seafood. Beautiful coffee at the end.The three hours slipped away in a drunken bliss. A memorable treat
4
In the middle of the Orchard Road area, Mezza9 at the Hyatt Hotel is always worth a visit. Made easy to visit for pedestrians, it's made even easier for people who come by car...the valet service is excellent and not the most expensive in town. The restaurant on the second floor is stylishly decorated with custom furniture, the food on display, the open kitchen concept the backdrop for a good time. The service staff is excellent, very attentive and accommodating. The menu exhaustive, from continental to local favourites, boston lobster to ee-fu noodles, charcoal grilled tenderloin to japanese sushi...The wine list is fitting for any Micheline star restaurant, from about 120 to 1400 dollars. Make a reservation, just to be sure you get a good table...6416718
4
With an extensive menu, Mezza9 will ensure that you can fulfill your cravings. The set menus are great value, allowing you to have a little bit of everything with your meal. I had the thai set, and while nice, the green curry could have done with a little bit less coconut milk. Still great, though a bit on the pricey side
4
I had a 3 courses set lunch there for SG$39. The food are ok but the resturant looks very nice. It's good for both lesuire and business. Service is nice but they gave me a different dish than my original order, I didn't wanna wait so I just accepted. Overall is good experience.
5
This restaurant's design and standards has been copied all over but non of the copiers can get close to its service and delivery. Everytime we come Singapore we go there and we always have the best restaurant experience. The service is just right the food stations are always spotles and fresh. There is nothing like Mezza9 experience
3
Had a business dinner here on Thursday and sorry to say it has become quite tired.Yes the service is courteous and efficient as usual but as somebody who attended the opening oh so long ago,it is disappointing that the menu has hardly changed in all that time. It is competently presented but as to its actual quality,well that is debatable.It certainly does not rate above 3 stars.The good news,the wine list is excellent when they actually have hat they list which itself seems to be a challenge on my last few visits.Overall it is time to refresh the concept perhaps but certainly the menu !
5
I spent a very lovely evening here with my partner and son and thought the food was superb. Menu choice was diverse and flexible for a younger palette, my son loved the crispy noodles with beef.The layout and design of this open plan space is light and airy with glass screens dividing the chefs from the restaurant..watching them is fascinating. The stylish furniture and simplicity of interior design is sophisticated, but not too formal. It is very cosmopolitan and has a great buzz. All in all...a unique experience
5
This by far the best place for Sunday Brunch in Singapore. Choice and quality of food is amazing. You will get everything from oysters, lobsters, parma ham, roast and Yorkshire pudding, sushi, yaki tori, Chinese style roast duck/pork and chicken rice to amazing fruit sweet/cake stations.Brunch is not cheap, but different option including free flow of soft drink and/or alcohol (eg beer, wine and champagne) are available.Book early and make a reservation for the private round table near the Japanese section if you are branching with more the 4 people
5
I think this is one of the best restaurant in Singapore
it is situated in a nice hotel
the food is just delicious, the meat is very good and tasty
I really enjoyed it
5
We enjoyed our food and beverage in the Hyatt.
We felt very happy after being served by the host Mr. Stefan Beer.
We can recommend it really. Just brilliant.
4
I've been coming to Hyatt for a few years now for all different occassions and have always found it to be super reliable and consistant. Last time i visited was for a business dinner, we dined at Mezzanine, great selection/variety which made life very easy, especially when entertaining a group of multinationals. Martini bar is always lots of fun, great vibe
4
Mezza9 offers a wide range of different dishes from different areas. Fresh seafood, sashimi, sushi, various Japanese delicacies like Yakitori or Tempura, Thai dishes and western food. It is always hard to make a decision. Tonights crab cakes, the tomato & avocado salad, the platter of sashimi all fulfilled expectations (although the sashimi could have been a bit larger for 2). The wine selection by the glass is sufficient enough and the list of vintages by the bottle impressive and a selection is also possible with a reasonable amount (which is relative) of money in mind. Service excellent, not had a bad dinner or lunch since being here the first time in 2002

I met a friend for dinner at Mezza9 who frequents the restaurant.The house staff knows him by his first name and the table he likes to sit at.The decor is a beautiful "island style" set up, which is somewhat to be expected for the big "fancy" restaurant located in an international hotel chain. I have seen similar set ups in Mumbai, Delhi and Shanghai. It is a hard wood decor with much glass, so you can see what the chef is preparing at that station. It is probably wonderful for the Sunday brunch - which I heard is worth waiting an extra day for, if you can.The food was first rate - we had the soft shell crab appetizer and the spring rolls. They were great. For the main course we had the mezza9 seafood grill which was a nice variety, all items cooked to perfection.For the right occasion in Singapore, I would put Mezza9 at the top of my list of restaurants to come back to

Excellent. Went there again last Sunday with the family. After two more or less disappointing other brunches in the last weeks, I only have one comment: This place is by far the best.If you enjoy Sunday brunch, it´s a must going there. Excellent food quality across all cuisines including Perrier Jouet champagne flow non-stop from 11:30am to 3pm.They also offer attractive rates for children.It´s not cheap, but worth every single $

I stayed at the hotel for 11 days and ate most days in Messa9. I found the diversity of the menuand the food to be excellent. Chef Stefan is one of the best and made very special meals formy husband and me. I hope to return and enjoy the restaurant and the great chef again soonPearl and Mel Shiffma

I was having dinner with friends at Mezza9 and the chef Stefan recommended venison which was excellent - perfectly cooked. His attention to detail and customer service was what one would expect of a top 5 star hotel restaurant. Keep up the good work!Andy M

I had heard and read many good things about the quality of the food at this restaurant but hadn't had an opportunity to sample it for myself till recently. My wife and I were entertaining a visitor and decided to bring him here for a weekday dinner.Noticed a slight hesistancy with the staff at arrival when they had a little trouble confirming our reservations but excellent service from then on. Was greeted by the sous chef, Stefan Beers, and managed to speak to some of the chefs prior to making our selections. We chose from a variety of cuisines to sample the various dishes on offer. I especially liked the Maryland crabcakes which were tastier than the ones I had tried in Maryland. Waiting staff were attentive and friendly and the restaurant's atmosphere was fairly lively. It's not cheap but certainly for a special occasion, it's well worth the splurge for the experience

We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Singapore and had an unexpected pleasure.As hosts of a dinner party for ten international VIPs, we chose the Mezza 9 restaurant which is spacious and beautifully done, architecturally speaking. It has a huge visible kitchen and a broad menu to match. Their 5 star chefs can match any request.Executive Sous Chef Stephan Beer ,recently in from Switzerland, put on a show of shows for us. His synchronized and well timed delivery of dishes and drinks, as well as special requests could not have been orchestrated better by an olympic dance coach. He is a sweet guy and a pro's pro.The food, in all about five different ethnic varieties, along with a huge display of perfectly pink Alaskan crab legs as a center-piece, was totally divine. We all took turns changing places at the huge round table to carry on and socialize with each and every person. This was at least a 5 star experience.Looking back, I had forgotten that it was my own birthday party we were hosting, simply because each moment was supported by timing, taste, and esthetics.Thank you Stefan, Vina, Githa, and the entire crew at Mezza 9 Singapore! Success

I have eaten here twice and find the standard of food and service very good. Interesting concept. I have found better restaurants in SG however it gives a first time traveller to SG a great food start.
1
Went to Mezza9 for lunch with a friend. Ordered a set meal and a few glasses of wine (by the glass not by the bottle). Food was good but the bill was an eye popping $680 !!!
4
Good service, good food, good wine, good look, good price, direct access to car park = perfect option for lunch. Ideally located within Grand Hyatt hotel.
4
Very tasty restaurant in that Grand Hyatt with intelligent mix of different cuisines, always fresh and well prepared. The wine list is also interesting and the guest can chose the bottles in the glass transparent wine fridges all around the restaurant. A cigar room is available nearby for the ones who want to go for a break during their meal. Excellent service that can be expected with Hyatt reputation
5
I have been living in Singapore for 8 years and have been to numerous Sunday brunches and so far I feel that the one at Mezza9 is by far the best. The food selection is perfect and the variety couldn't be better. The service has always been impeccable and they go out of the way to make sure you are enjoying yourself. The last time we were there was during the F1 races and it was completely full, but still everything worked fantastic, the food was excellent and the service was also quick making sure the champagne and wine glasses always were full. I want to say a special thank you to Sous Chef Stefan Beer who came by our table and asked how things were to make sure everything was fine. Despite the busy time Stefan took the time to take some special request from us. Thanks Stefan and keep up the great work!. Finally, I also want to thank the Manager at Mezza9, Jonas Corse who does a fantastic job running this restaurant. We will be coming back and back and back again
5
The food, vibe, service and the attentive staff - one of the best in Singapore.Excellent menu selection from Japanese, Thai, Chinese and Western Grill - whoever you bring, everybody will find something they like!A regular venue for my entertainment in Singapore.Chef Stefan and his team do a great job
4
Was at the Martinibar (a small lounge area within the Mezza9 restaurant) recently to meet a friend. We were spoilt for choice from a list of 30 different types of Martinis to choose. The food menu has a good selection of snacks and the serving portion is good for 2 to 3 persons. The prices for food and drinks are standard hotel pricing. The lounge is cozy and the cushions are very comfortable. The serving staff are friendly and accommodating and they are fast to clear our empty plates and glasses.As there are limited seating area within Maritinbar, try to get there before 630pm as crowds will start to form around 645pm to 7pm. A good place for gathering of not more than 4 to 5 people
4
Have been visiting Mezza9 for the past 15 years since its inception. Have always found the food to be of exceptional quality. Their Sunday brunch is the best I have seen anywhere in the world for its sheer spread of cuisine. The quality of service is always exceptional. HIGHLY recommend a visit if you are in Singapore

We ordered the seafood grill. Extra fries and muschrooms. The mushrooms were superb, the fries not fresh and hot, made from industrial frozen ones. I especially asked the tuna and the salmon to be half grilled - I believe it simply was forgotten on the grill and was completely dry inside. The boston lobster had schrinked to micro proportions. I sent everything back. The second batch was better, the tuna however was even worse. At the end of the dinner my sister joined us. I asked 4 times for a chair which never came, we were simply ignored by an arrogant staff whom said loudly "they don't want to move they want an extra chair" then ignored usnagain and left. I had to get up and get a chair from another table. The table was never cleaned, never. I asked for the bill, paid and left. No good bye, no thank you, nothing. After more than 20 visits to Mezza9 we will probably skip it in the future. Sad how things can go turn that bad

Went to the Hyatt for Sunday brunch with some friends and I have to say, i have never seen such terrible displays of over-eating and rude behavior. There were many families with their kids taking plate after plate of food, not eating it, and their maid sitting there eating nothing (presumably because their employers were too tight to fork out for them). Many locals pushing and jostling for the seafood as it came out of the kitchen. Expats going crazy on the freeflow alcohol and making fools of themselves. A revolting scene.Anyway, I tried the food. Not bad but very expensive and as I say the atmosphere completely ruined my appetite
5
This is great - service is top notch and the menu is extensive. Steaks are good with my favorite being the 260G Fillet.
Difficult to go wrong here
5
Good selection and quality. But prepare to "burn the wallet".
5
The food at Mezza9 was excellent. There was such a large menu and whilst we went with mainly Thai, I salivated at the table next to me that was eating the most divine looking Chilli crab. The soft shell crab Thai salad was amazing.
5
Multiple cuisine from western to Asian. Amazing. once in ur life u must try the Sunday brunch. Expensive but to dye for.
3
We ordered the seafood platter to share which was excellent. Side order of asparagus was over cooked though and lacking in asparagus heads!
5
Dining at Mezza9 is a true experience. Being able to chose from different types of cuisines - offers its guests the possibility to choose dishes all over the world (asian, european, etc). What makes things even more interesting & enjoyable is that a majority of the kitchens are "open-view" kitchens. People are able to see how their food is cooked & prepared by excellent Chef's. To keep my review short - the Mezza9 is a definite MUST for everyone visiting Singapore. Even living in Singapore, I visit M9 at least once or twice a month. Should you be there on a Sunday - you have to try the Sunday Brunch! All wishes in regards to food and beverages are displayed throughout the restaurant in Buffet style. An amazing experience. Thanks to the great Chefs & service staff who make each visit unforgettable
4
Not sure what you're hungry for? This in-hotel restuarant on Scotts road is the place for you. The menu features various Asian & international choices, with open view kitchens which will spoil you for choice. good fresh ingredients, reasonable service, great desserts. Large place so not for romantic dinners, but well appointed and friendly staff
5
We went for dinner and decided on the set menu, which was quite varied, ranging from western to japanese, chinese, thai and other asian, and the best part was that we could scramble our choices! I went for the sushi appetizer, grilled lamb rack and cheeses & fruit for dessert. Sushi was very fresh and quite good, but it was the lamb rack that blew me away ... the best ever! Portions are big too, so well worth the price .... except for the seafood on ice appetizer my friend had, which was just one each of 4 kinds.Waiters were very attentive and took time to explain the menu options.I would return on another special occasion
5
With a price tag of $128++ you could be forgiven for thinking this as a bit over the top for a Sunday lunch. But it was my birthday treat so who was counting.Curious to what would be on offer and the definition of free flow champagne I'm glad I gave breakfast a miss and I wasn't disappointed. Waiters discreetly poured almost as soon as a sip had been taken. So be careful. It would be easy to be carried away, though the amount of mouth watering offerings are sure to soak up some of the excess. A seafoodie I could have just stayed with the lobster, crab, enormous prawns and mussles. But a total foodie, I couldn't resist lightly fried duck liver as a second course, selecting rare lamb from the carvery for mains. Garnished with Yorkshire pud and gravy, creamed spinach and sauted mushrooms contributed to the attempt for my five a day! I just couldn't do justice to the huge range of deserts and opted to have bite size pieces of cheesecake, chocolate mousse, chocolate petit fours (yes chocaholic too). A nitrogen poached blob of cream was turned into icecream before my very eyes adding a quirky and interesting twist. The meal was rounded off nicely with a selection of morsels of cheese from a superb board ( no room for crackers or exotic breads). The aged Gouda was particularly flavoursome and a glass of Cloudy Bay Sauv Blanc to accompany it (ok bit of a wino too!) ended the most civilised, ambient lunch I've ever had. Value is second to none. Whose birthday is it next!
4
had a great meal for dinner at the mezza 9. one can choose from asian to western so is a good choice if you have a mixed crowd which can't decide what and where to eat. also good wine selection even if a bit over priced, but let's enjoy
5
Everything here is perfect..waiters, food, wine, atmosphere...a place to recommend. The grill dishes are very tasty..especially the sea food.
4
Never failed to disappoint. No out of the world experience but with the above avg price range and consistent food quality, ambience and service. It's worth going!
5
I got the black pepper crab which I thought was actually better than Jumbo's. I'd order it again.
3
not much happening and its expansive. go once is enough.
4
lots of choices. interesting ambience. a bit pricey at dinnertime.
4
The ambience, food and service quality is so good but expensive for a Hyatt (it is not Grand Hyatt even if they call it Grand!)
5
This buffet has AWESOME seafood and everything else to offer to.
5
We have been coming to mezza9 for over 10 years and often go more than once when we are in town.The variety of high quality food combined with pleasant efficient and relaxed service is unbeatable.The concept of having 5 different cuisines is also great if you are with a group of friends

I have been here before so I came here with higher expectations. I made reservations online and got an email saying something to the effect of "we have received your reservation request and will confirm it in another email". We'll 2 hours before my reservation I still have not heard back from the restaurant. So I called and they confirmed it over the telephone. Ok. Great. I went there wanting to indulge in the king crab legs. But much to my dismay they were out of them! So i had to switch to the cold ones. Which were ok. We ordered the seafood platter set for 2 people which had the only cooked crab legs. The lobster was a bit rubbery and tasted overcooked. Same with the crab legs. Kind of let down. Because last time I had them they were FABULOUS! When it came time to order desert, there was no chocolate cake. Actaully the cake selection wasn't anything special. When it came time to ask for the bill, I asked 2 different wait staff who both nodded and said yes. But 5 and 10 minutes later, no bill had appeared. It wasn't until I had to get up out of my seat and walk to the counter did I get my bill.This was a date night. So I had specifically asked for a quiet table, which when I walked in to the restaurant I thought would be no problem as it was half empty. But they still managed to sandwich us in between 2 other people on each side. So bad that to walk to my side of the table I had to circle around the other people eatting there.For the money spent for dinner for 2 ($300+ without alcohol) I really expect more

This March visit was a date night, with a daughter accompanying. Had my usual, the restaurant's take on Salad Nicoise of perfectly portioned seared fresh ahi tuna. Coming from the US, when an appetite calls for a big salad, it's very hard to find it in Singapore. I have tried may restaurants on this island looking for a good big bowl of salad, but most often the "salad" is a starter-- mini sprigs greens on a fancy plate. The salad here is good portion. Husband went for the sushi platter. He said they are surprising excellent quality. The daugther went for the the stir fried beef with a side order of rice. This dish was huge with very succulent beef- another winner. Definitely a return, because there are so many options: Mezza9 is derived because of the 9 different options: the grill: western grill & rotisseriesushi: traditional Japanese sushi and sashimi baryakitori: yakitori grillthe steam basket: traditional Chinese seafoodthe deli: European deli, Thai deli & crustacean barthe shop: gourmet boutiquethe patisserie: dessertsthe wine cellar: walk-in wine cellarsthe bar: martini & cigar barDespite being in the Orchard area, the price was not bad for the quality and size. Service was excellent as the prior time. The wine selection good. The only complaint from husband is that the seat is not comfortable. The chair design is stiff and not suitable for relaxing dining
2
It was my favourite hangout till I was snubbed by the wait staff after its renovation. Guess I'll have to dye my hair blonde to get a proper service next time.
They still make the best Mojito on the island.
4
Nice and good food, however the price is a bit pricey. Could have kept the price range and provide better variety of food.
5
While the food is fab, the atmosphere is quite noisy and very obviously a hotel
5
Great food, lots of choices and cuisine. Something for everybody.
4
Had Sunday champagne brunch in Mezza9 with 12 colleagues and had a great time. We were sat in a prviate room that was a wine cellar. Food was awesome, champagne and wines were superb.A must for a business brunch.For normal dining there are 9 cookng stations with food from all round the world and everything i tried was fantastic. Don't hesitate as you won't be disappointed
5
The service is excellent. We had a personal waiter attending to us throughout the whole night. The food was delicious, the wine excellent and the desserts superb. We also ordered a cheese platter which was a disappointment - it was packed cheese bought from any supermarket.. not what you expect from this restaurant.
4
Ordered the mixed grill platter for 2 and it was good. Everything on the platter was grilled to perfection. The only pity is that it is a little pricey. The seafood looks fresh and enticing but we have not tried it as we were there just for a casual dinner. Not too prepared to splurge that evening. Had a couple of beer and it was pretty good too. Fantastic ambience and service. Will pop by again if I have spare cash and in the mood for seafood or steak
5
The food and service here is simply outstanding! We had a family dinner here and chose all dishes family style from the menu. Our server was truly exceptional and very professional (Sam?). We had Steamed fish with ginger and soy sauce, egg noodles, mustard plant veggies and tiger prawn; all of which I would highly reccommend. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to all our friends and family
5
The all you can eat and drink option has to be experienced at least once at Mezza9 and then if you still have energy (instead of needing a sleep) then you can hit the shops on orchard road afterward. Quality plus and it is really value for money if you love food and champagne
2
The many reviews in TA generally praise Mezza9 as a quite special experience, so for our one night in Singapore we got our Hotel Concierge to book us a table. We were told that they would hold the table for fifteen minutes but if it was not taken in that time it would be released. We arrived on time to find the cavernous restaurant barely one third full. It seemed an unnecessarily strict injunction for what was obviously a slack night. The vast space is divided by wooden slatted screens to make smaller and more intimate dining areas, each of, or most, having a specialist cooking station.The stations include ones for Sushi, Seafood, Grills, Thai and so on. We were seated in a rather deserted area with the air-conditioning a bit high for our comfort and nowhere near one of the food stations. We have eaten in places where various food styles are dispensed from individual stations and where you can roam and build a meal from all that is on offer. This is what we expected here, but we were presented with a menu and not invited to wander the restaurant. Our first course was from the sushi and sashimi station. It was underwhelming. It was not the freshest sashimi we have had and we did wonder if it had been a wise choice on the third night of the Christmas holiday. However, good sushi can be held satisfactorily, or not served at all, so the selection should have been safe.The Chinese selection that followed was standard and nothing special. It did not help that the centrepiece was not well presented and looked unappetising. We thought we had done better in most London Chinese restaurants. Service was slow and steady but cheerful enough from the several staff that seemed to come and go. We never saw the same face twice.Most reporters here have been satisfied, so perhaps this was an off night. There is a vast selection of highly rated restaurants to choose from in Singapore so this was a disappointing experience
4
Great service, fab list of cocktails, just a good spot to hang out. Very nice ambiance and modern, darkly lit decor. A smoking room too is a bonus for me!
4
Make sure the men wear pants! Interesting menu, good food.
5
Had Sunday champagne brunch in Mezza9 with 14 colleagues and had a great time. Because of the size of our group we were sat in a prviate room that was a wine cellar. Food was awesome, champagne and wines were superb.There are 9 cookng stations with food from all round the world and everything i tried was fantastic. I you are contemptating giving it a try then don't hesitate as you won't be disappointed
5
On a recommendation from a friend who was staying at the Hyatt, we booked at Mezza9 for dinner. Everything seemed reasonably well priced for the quality/standard. Don't make the mistake of wearing long shorts as I did, as the dress standard is 'full length long pants' only for men (although they did lend me a pair of pants, and the maitre d did handle the issue very professionally...as normally I would have just walked out!So, I would say - high quality restaurant - great food, very attentive staff
4
This is a place that manages to serve many different types of food, and do them all well. We stopped in for a quick lunch and really enjoyed the food. The service was friendly, though we did have trouble getting their attention a couple of times, as the restaurant was quite busy (and therefore a bit noisy as well). The food was good quality and well-prepared. I would definitely return
5
Mezza9 came into existence in 1998. Designed by Super Potato Interiors it was the first total fusion restaurant in South East Asia. With its open design concept you see the chefs of each section at work - Chinese - Western - Japanese. The layout and its Zen design is already a visual pleasure - the food variety and its quality are just excellent. If you are into sushi - you will love the quality n variety offered - incl some amazing sake choices. The Grand Hyatt is well-known for its wine selections, and the Mezza9 wine list will not disappoint. Three cheers to he Mezza9 staff - they are just great. Do try the Sunday Brunch - and after 3 hours of good food & company, your next move is to the Martini Bar - for coffee or a digestive, or both. Mezza9 is my regular dining-out-spot - alone or w friends or for corporate occasion
5
I have had many visits to Mezza9 both with business partners, my girlfriend and friends as well as by myself. The place always makes me feel good and well treated. Food selection is not the largest in Singapore but one with superior quality that can match even the most discerned taste. Wine selection - huge. Service - absolutely nothing to complain about. Strongly recommended for any occasion
4
Oh my the champage brunch is to die for! Its very reasonable in Singapore $138++ including a really great selection of food and beverage. I go to the Hyatt for dinner and always has the same qualitly of service. Will e going back next week for the brunch for my birthday so really looking forward to it
4
Read a few reviews on this restaurant that left me feeling a little unsure about making the effort to eat here. Am very pleased to report that the entire experience was very positive - from the friendly service through to the exceptional meal. We like to splurge with one or two extra special meals out while we're on a family holiday and I'm really glad that we got to eat at Mezza 9
5
Went to Mezza9 Restaurant at Singapore Hyatt and was very impressed with the wonderful quality of the food and the great service.We both had the 3 course luncheon and I had a delightful salad as an entree followed by the best Thia green curry. The flavours of the curry just burst in your mouth - it was wonderful.We followed that up with desert - 1 sorbet and 1 chocolate pudding (very nice) and coffee.A delightful place I would highly recomen
3
The food was really wonderful - Tasmanian oysters, lobster tails, foie gras, sushi, sashimi and so on.Good wine selection also by glass so don't miss it. I love there japanese assorted sashimi,But the service quiet not good.
4
Nice restaurant which offers a variety of cuisines, well executed, and obliging service. Nice wood interior. It is rather large, so not intimate or cosy, but I am comfortable here. Good for brunch.
4
Who said that average price is $10 ? Very good and fresh food cooked in front of you at the bars.
5
Been to Mezza 9 for the Brunch and just plain dinner, more that a few times. Always been good no problems and such an amazing dining experience. Honestly one of the to do things to do in Singapore.
5
Went there after recommendation from a friend for the Sunday Champagne brunch. A little pricey, but you are really in for a treat! All food is amazing and they make sure your wine or champagne never runs out!
Will definately go again!

My wife and I decided to make reservations after reading good reviews of this restaurant. When we arrived at 7pm there was only a handful of people there. Therefore, I am not sure why we were given a table in the middle of restaurant where everyone walks back and forth. This table was also directly in front of the station where the waiters enter their orders. Therefore, is was a natural water cooler spot for them to chat it up. After being seated and given our menu they asked what we wanted to drink. Obviously, we didn't have time to review their wine list or drink menu. So, we asked for a few minutes. After 15 minutes with our menus closed no one came back to take our drink or dinner order. This place was empty not sure why the service was so poor. They waitress must of know I was annoyed because when I asked for the check at the end of the night. She clearly ignored me cause it took another 10 minutes to get the check from another waiter. I get better service at the Food Republic . Save your money cause their wine are way over priced
5
Incredible tomato and avocado salad to start followed by melt in the mouth steak. Perfectly cooked with a sublime bernaise sauce and delicious green beans and mashed potato. One of the best meals I've had anywhere but the price tag matches it. $238SGD with no wine. I would definitely go back thoug
4
If you have a heavy wallet (whoever said the average price is $10) then Mezza9 is one of those things in Singapore you shouldn't miss. Authentically crafted dishes are tasteful in every way & served in an overwhelmingly culinary ambience, with food being chopped & cooked right before you.I particularly found the Cigar lounge to be uber cool, being a cigar aficionado myself. All the top brands are stacked full & I ended up getting puzzled which ones to take, although sitting in the lounge (although small in size) & completing a cigar was the real deal.We ordered some fried chicken (w/o shrimp), 2 bowls of rice cooked with fish & egg & prawns, ending up with a bill of $130, excluding our visit to the Cigar lounge that followed.Service was fast, to say the least, though we had to wait for a good 5 minutes to get a table, & another 10 minutes at the Cigar lounge, was a busy weekend maybe. We had USD with us & paying wasn't a problem because the wonderful hostesses took the trouble of getting the currency changed from somewhere downstairs & returning the balance amount all within 5 minutes.All in all, if you are a fan of fine dining & are currently in Singapore don't miss out on Mezza9
4
The restaurant is located within the Grand Hyatt Hotel. One might not like hotel restaurants, but this one is worth trying. The restaurant is open space, meaning you can see the kitchen and choose the food. It offers different Asian menues. I suggest walking around, maybe you prefer Japanese. Setting is informal and prices reasonable
3
My friends and I went to mezza9 for some drinks recently. My…..my…….I have to serve myself! I ordered a number of martinis and instead of delivering the drinks to me and my friends; I have to bring the drinks to myself.  The bartender just plonk the drinks right next to my group and mumbled some words (which I think he was trying to tell us the name of the drink). He then went on to mix the next drink. Huh? What kind of service is this? I am sick and tired of the service standards in Singapore. I am paying good money for my drinks too. Really next time, go to another place where service is guaranteed. If not, might as well buy your own drinks and mix it yourself
5
Just nice ;-). time and time again
4
Love the sunday brunch!
4
This was a really good surprise. Heard lots of good things about it and it was good. Great selection of different cuisines, good ambience and service. Enjoyed the place.
4
Seared Tuna Steaks are a must here
4
Great food
5
Great place to chill and enjoy there happy hour drinks. I love there japanese assorted sashimi. Great service, friendly staff.

Always one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore, the atmosphere and quality of food always pleases, but service was a bit inconsistent.The restaurant is designed by the Tokyo design genious "Super Potato," with open cooking stations dominating the venue. Tables are places around the cooking stations, so that every table feels like a chef's table. Its an inspired and risky design, that works fabulously.The menu is polyglot, with Western, Thai, Chinese, and Japanese favorites. In the past we have tired the Japanese fare which we found to be acceptable, although we prefer Shiraishi in the Ritz Carlton Singapore for authentic Japanese.This time we landed a table near the spectacular open grilling station, and enjoyed the show as Mezza 9's team of skilled chefs cooked meat and other dishes on open charcoal flames. We were also impressed by the wood oven in the rear as of the station as well. We selected the mixed meal plate, which was a savory and succulent assortment of meats from the charcoal grill. An assortment of lamb, sausage, chicken, and beef, each meat was grilled to perfection with an authentic infusion of just grilled flavor.Service was a bit spotty - although the staff are well trained and professional, we felt that on occasion we were forgotten. Aside from a water order, nothing arrived on our table after seating and the amount of time between appetizer and mains service was strangely long. In fact, after a long service quiet period , we began a 5 minute countdown to walk out, but luckily the main arrive with 60 seconds to go.Overall, we like Mezza 9 for the variety and quality of the cuisine, but would like to see the service be more consistent
4
Went for the Christmas brunch today, it was truly excellent. I am an afficionado of high quality fresh seafood and Mezza 9 doesn't disappoint. Lobster, oysters, crabs, king prawns, sushi, sashimi all washed down with free flow Mumm champagne - I was in seventh heaven. Only issues - salt and pepper grinders had seen better days and didn't really grind - I think the Hyatt could afford to replace them. Also the mayonnaise didn't really taste of anything and I'm not convinced it was home made, which is a shame when the shellfish is this good
4
I visiting a friend in Singapore and we decided to take part in the Mezza9 Sunday Brunch at the Grand Hyatt. The food was really wonderful - lobster tails, Tasmanian oysters, foie gras, sushi, sashimi, french cheeses, Chinese food, yakatori, prime rib, creamed spinach, wonderful desert station. The service was excellent and the champagne was free flowing. Its very pricey, but I would definitely recommend it
4
Went there a few yrs ago actually, but I still have fond memories of their Sunday Champagne Brunches. The choices were essentially endless. The salad bar itself had such a wide variety to choose from, then there was the cold meat and deli sections. Table after table of food! If you are looking for a more local/ Oriental flavour there is the Japanese section serving the likes of tempura prawns, fresh sashimi, and a variety of sushi. If you want seafood, then pick up a few oysters, mussles, crab, lobster ... etc from the table of crushed ice. Want a roast?? Head to the carving station.Now, the DESSERT section .... is to DIE FOR! Chocolate fountains, jars and jars of various bon-bons, cookies, biscuits, melts. Marshmallows, jam drops, tarts, flans, chocolate cups .... the list goes on!! Wash it all down with unlimited amounts of champers and you'll be set for the entire afternoon (hic!) . The ambiance was satisfactory ... I mean it IS a hotel, and it's to be expected what any hotel restaurant would look like. The service was also satisfactory. It was casual enough for people to bring in their kids too, so I'd say it had a family feel to the place. All in all it was an excellent way to spend farewell party with friends, and in Singapore, what better way than to spend it eating in style. Can be a bit steep on price, but your ARE paying for unlimited amounts of champagne after all
