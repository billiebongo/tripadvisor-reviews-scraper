Food here is fantastic with very friendly waitstaff üòÅ Recommended for large parties or even just for a nice dinner for two. We had the quesadillas and really recommend the baked papas!
5
Food was excellent- fresh, great for sharing (the crab tostadita was a highlight)
Service was great- fast, friendly and recommended excellent food and drinks we thoroughly enjoyed!
Shout-out to Riki and Ivan - will be back soon for a Mexican fix!

Bad experience as when I was there with family, the menu totally changed so didn't know what to order. Seek help from the waiter but he'd definitely not helpful and gave us the look that we shouldn't be dining there if we know nothing.

Went there for dinner and drinks with friends and was not dissapointed one bit. The view was amazing, the food was to die for and the service was top notch. Would recommend to anyone from anywhere to visit this place. They wont be dissapointed!
5
Amazing view and food, especially loved the esquites and quesadilla. Extensive margarita list, frozen lychee is a must try! Service is impeccable too. Will definitely come again!
5
Amazing food..really enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and steak. Margaritas are great as well and to top it off, awesome service!
5
Excellent food the view is amazing, perfect place to go for drinks and obviously to see the marina bay

We wasn‚Äôt impressed with the food here. The Quesadillas didn‚Äôt taste very good at all. My wife ordered vegetarian and it was basically just cheese! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend eating here

Mexico and Singapore are pretty far from each other on the map and in culinary experience and flavors. This restaurant did Mexico proud for being based in Singapore! The margaritas were well made, tortillas fresh and meats flavored authentically. It helped that service was pretty awesome AND fast! I'd recommend this eatery to anyone in Singapore who has a hammering from Mexican food and fun

Seems like a nice enough place. The beer was cold ... once I could actually get someone to actually take the order. I imagine the chips and salsa would have been good too ... someone actually did take that order, but as I'm writing this, at the end of 30 minutes or so slowly drinking a beer and enjoying the breeze, the snack has not materialized. I wasn't hungry, was just going to munch on something, so haven't made a thing of it, just sat here waiting to see if the guy who took the order, and who has passed by the table 3 or 4 times since taking the order, will have a moment of clarity.But apparently not. So, nice view, crap service. I work close by, but wont be back - ever
5
Great option for weekend dinners; offers great view of Marina Bay Sands and good cocktails. Serving generally helps one person.
5
Superb service by Mike and Khai!! Very attentive to our requests. Good recommendations for food as well as drinks.
Definitely will come back to them very often.
Thumbs up!!

Are there this evening and timed dinner to perfection witnessing the 8pm MBS light show from our quayside table. The food was excellent. We ordered 5 dishes in total which was more than ample. The soft shell crab taco was excellent but so was everything else to be honest. The staff were incredibly friendly recommending most of our dishes and that we should opt for the more finger food style stuff rather than a main given we weren't starving. This was a good shout and certainly not an unsatisfactory amount either. I would thoroughly recommend booking a table on the quayside that overlooks MBS, great place for a final dinner in Singapore.
5
An absolutely epic view of Marina Bay Sands at night and sweet Mexican style menu to boot! We reserved a table for 15+ for my birthday and they took care of everything and even served me a beautiful birthday cake that my friend had bought me prior by keeping it chilled in the fridge. Thank you for an epic birthday! Will be back in the near future.
4
Great location especially if you can swing a table outdoors. The menu is extensive and we liked quite a few items including corn on the cob (elote), a dish which had tequilla soaked raisins and guacamole (freshly prepared).Since this was a drinks dinner with less focus on food, I'd be back for another visit but first impressions was interesting experiments with Mexican food and definitely worth a look
5
We had a birthday dinner at Super Loco Customs House. The food is really good and has very friendly service. The resturant overlooks Marina Bay Sands. We get to watch the laser light show beaming from Marina Bay Sands over the water - which was a treat! We will definitely be back.
2
The ambience is lovely, but the food and drinks here are highly overpriced (we're talking about Mexican street food here, using the simplest of ingredients). You can get better, more authentic Mexican food elsewhere. Servings are small too, so you'll end up ordering between 3-4 dishes per person. Dessert is blah.
5
We had been recommended to go here and we are glad we went for dinner!Awesome views, we had a table outside, with a view to the Marina Bay Sands and the evening Laser Water Show across the water.Had salsa and guacamole to start with 2 delicious cocktails and then some Tacos.I had the soft shell crab and also the prawn Taco which were sensational.The service, location and food were all excellent!Couldn't recommend more highly

We stopped here on a whim on the night of one of the National Day celebrations because our son was fascinated by the Zodiac boats with guns standing by to take part in the event. After lingering and watching for 20 mins, we eyed up the gorgeous drinks that seemed to be coming from the bar and asked if we could get a table for drinks. We bagged a prime table, ordered a jug of margaritas and settled down to watch the amazing display out over the marina as the sun set over Marina Bay Sands and the skyline. There was no pressure to give up our table to those eating - though we ordered some nachos and another jug of margaritas along the way - and Jen, our server was really chatty and friendly to our son, taking him out to the barriers to see the lights and fireworks and even bring him a complimentary ice-cream.In short, we had a serendipitous lovely evening here - an unexpectedly great fireworks show in the perfect location for watching the ND celebrations. If we're back in Singapore, we'll definitely be back to take in the skyline views and the great drinks, at this cool, little bar & restaurant on Collyer Quay
4
being suggested this location by a local was the first sign I should've have known this would be something special.sitting just metres from the water looking across to Marina Bay Sands the view is spectacular & a perfect place to fill your belly before enjoying an evening out in the heart of Singapore
5
Visited a couple of times even recommended to friends. Lovely view with excellent service and good drinks. What's not to love about Super loco?
5
All staff are up to speed on Gluten free food (not like other restaurants in Singapore) Great Mexican food and service. Will dine there next trip for this reason.
5
Very good service.. Really enjoy the tacos and especially the magharitas! Will definately come bck! Gracias!
5
FULL of flavours and generous portion.Recommended by the staff.It was great with mexican beer Amber ale.
5
Great location, drinks, snacks. . great all round. . no point saying drinks were expensive, as that is a staple for every bar in the country. . . great palce to sit and chill and watch the world go by over some decent drinks. . . staff all great to
1
Here is a place for which service does not matter whatsoever. Firstly no one ever picks up the reservation line. So when you go to make a reservation no matter how many days in advance, it seems they are always fully booked. Wasn't a small reservation I was making - drinks and food for 20 people for a Monday evening 4 days in advance. And guess what - we are fully booked. And this was the third instance. After a few arguments - we will give you 2 tables for 6 people each and no more. This is what is called "service" and unfriendliness. Disgustin
5
Beautiful view from outside, the waiter was very good with helping us decide and very nice aswell which always makes it better. Food was good and the red wine was to my exact taste. Not too pricey for Singapore so would definitely visit here again for sure :)
5
Rated number 1 Mexican restaurent in Singapore and they certainly did not disappoint! Authentic Mexican food, ice cold beers and margaritas makes for a prefect night out. They have great location and view which allows you to be in the hustle of town but not overly crowded!Must tries - carne asada (skirt steak). Generous portion and cooked perfectly medium rare. Every bite was flavourful.Wonderful service, staff are warm and friendly and you can clearly see they are enjoying their job!
5
I had a very good like afternoon tea but they offer me amazing cocktail acai spearmint mezcalita and super thomas , i love it so much and enjoy the time breezing and smoothing place good coming with friends and lovely people here and i will be coming back often salute 
5
One of the best Alfresco dining views in Singapore. The food is authentic and delicious. The Fish Taco and Cheese Quesadilla, yum! Visited during their happy hour, and their Margaritas are dangerously addictive. One of the longest drinks menus ever encountered. They have a really wide range of tequilas which I intend to try when I next visit. To also mention, their Pulpo dish (Octopus with Chorizo crumble) and Chicken Wings (deep fried and tossed with Habanero sauce). The former meaty and moorish, the latter spicy and zesty. Some of the best service I've experienced in Singapore. The waiters are attentive, warm and very helpful. Quite a rarity in the island's restaurant scene. Last but not least, the bay view is primo (facing the Marina Bay Sands) and there's great music too! Playlist yes, but well curated playlist! :) Overall great vibes! Definitely my favourite of all the Loco sites in town
5
Great selection of tequilas and awesome food but the key factor was the warm smiles and friendly service rendered by the waitress, Fiza. She went out of her way to Ensure we had a good time!
Definitely coming back for more!

Alfresco Dinning on the water overlooking the Marina Bay Sands. Cab rank out the front of the Fullerton. Good food and beer selection. Good service by Singapore standards.
5
Superloco @ customs house is an art piece when ur sitting facing the mbs, wif delicious tacos and a glass of Margarita in hand... I can never compare to any other experience I had in other restaurants along Fullerton bay hotel... My cangrejo(soft shell crab) and calabaza(pumpkin) tacos were juicy and hearty, even when it's juz I pc each... My Margarita Ultimo balanced of sweet and smoky and quite aromatic... My palates had an gastronomic-orgasm!! Perfect meal... No, I don't mind another glass.. Everyone was smiling and friendly...even for Monday blues... The only blue I feel, or see, for that matter, are just the clouds... Wif hues of purple come the evening... Caping around the majestic MBS... I went home a happy gurl...
5
We booked the table for 3, plus one baby with the stroller. They reserved the best seat for us at the semi outdoor area, just nice for the baby. The view was fantastic and the food was excellent, really impressed with the service. This place has become our number one of where to go for Mexican food. The price is very typical for this kind of food, service and location. We would definitely go back again
5
Been here three times now. Personal favorites and what I would recommend to have are their chicken wings, snapper ceviche, tuna with crispy tortillas and their amazing Pescado Taco!!! Fantabulous cocktails too! What they call passion fruit smashito and another with cucumber and mezcal! Can't wait for my next visit
4
Dropped in for a few beers after a long day on foot. Super Loco has a really nice vibe about and a fantastic view. Prices are typical for Singapore which are on the expensive side. Overall I would recommend for the view and quaint size of the establishment
5
Visited Super Loco with my husband during rush hour on Friday evening. We didn't have reservation, so we were not sure if we got table as the place was almost full. However, the manager managed to arrange us nice setup beside the bar.The food and service was very nice. Special thanks for Mr. Ivan for explaining the menu and attending us even if things were super hectic. All food was actually nice. We both liked the pork carnitas the most. These guys and girls definitely know what they are doing
4
I wasn't expecting the flavour, with the beef seemingly marinated-for-a-week and the fish slathered in a great sauce, making it the most flavoursome Mexican food I've had in Singapore. Service sucks - expect to see half a dozen staff standing around chatting and ignoring the customers - but it's a nice set-up by the water with an attractive room plus outdoor seating, great for a casual party
3
~I definitely dunno how to eat this so it's badly biased... but there' good stuff too!~a colleague of mine wanted a quick lunch and I'd overheard many talking about how we should go Super Loco at Customs House so we went for a walk and easily got a table to 2 without reservations despite an almost full house!~we'd been seated near the entrance where the high chairs were tabled and these chairs are really meant for tall people (I'm height challenged) so after a bit of waiting we did get seated inside which is a nice touch of service during the busy rushBeef Taco: absolutely cannot eat this strange tasting beef OMGPork Tostada: amazing blissful taste, juicy and super YUMzI think I know why the ladies love to go there for the small portions with tortillas and tacos having very little carbs but I gotta have a real meal
5
the moment I stepped in...out, actually, coz the restaurant's best seats are mostly at the alfresco area, I was in awe of the view. Delight didn't stop there as the service was consistently warm and very engaging. With a more upscale menu and its uniqueness, the food and cocktails served were exquisit
4
We loved this Mexican restaurant! Everything was good, tuna tostadas, chicken fajitas, all the salsas. Sat outside on the deck overlooking Marina Bay.
4
We had a great meal here a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Relatively expensive but work the money for a fun evening of mexican food.
5
Food was superb and the location is fab ....
If you are looking for an excellent restaurant superloco is the place cause of its utmost quality on food and service !!!
3
Quick dinner here for a friend's birthday and it was okay, but a little squishy. The restaurant is quite small and we had 11 of us so not much room. The food was just okay, servings are quite small, but reasonably priced and tasty. Didn't like the pork belly.The service was good and quick, couldn't complain about that, but guess they wanted to turn the table over quickly. The best part is the view of Marina Bay Sands and atmosphere.
5
Clean & modern Mexican restaurant with awesome view straight to Marina Bay.Service is flawless and everything comes out very fast.This is not truckers dinner place so if you are just looking for huge dishes soaked in cheddar this is not for you.Food they serve is very good with nice presentation and modern touch.Drink menu is impressive with large variety of drinks, and home made ingredients.Extra thanks to Mr.Ivan? to take very good care of us
5
We had a wonderful lunch here and the staff were very helpful with our dietary requirements. I am vegan and don't eat corn so I requested salsas with corn chips replaced by raw veggies and the kitchen was happy to accommodate. The salsas were delicious and each had a unique flavor and great balance.I also ordered a large salad, which was too salty when it came out. So I asked for it be changed and they very quickly brought out another one with salt on the side and it was perfect. This was done with a great attitude and it was clear they really wanted to make sure we were happy. Vegans and vegetarians will have no problem getting a satisfying meal here and you can bring your carnivorous friends and they will be very happy as well
5
Went there twice..1 for lunch and another forDinner.. have to say the food is really nice and decent portion.. the service crews were very friendly and attentive..Not to forget the amazing view of the marina! Rmb to get a seat outside.. so you can enjoy the view!
5
As expected, everywhere is fully book during the valentines,and my hubby wasnt able to make any reservation to the original place we should be going, so we walk and find a chill place. Superloco immediately grab our attention for the cool ambiance.But when we ask for table, they were fully booked too.But the staff was so nice and tried their best to find a place for us.After seating, Sir Mike was very helpful and very willing to explain us the menu sinceits our 1st time there, and since we dont know what to order, she called Jenny also a Filipino to guide us into our preferred tastes.Jenny was so cheerful, explain us the food with so much enthusiasm, and she did recommend well, because we enjoyed everything that we've ordered.So the service is reaaly really good.The food is all worth it!The ambiance is over looking the night lights of Marina Bay,What else could you ask for?Thanks guys for an amazing dinner, worth remembering.We will come back very soon!!!

Visited the restaurant on Valentine's Day. Place was busy but not full. Service was excellent. Food was good. Only downside was the host and staff were rather square on the seating arrangements. Like a table for 4 must be for 4 pax. Would be good if staff can exercise some judgment that customers do not like to be cramped next to other diners.
5
Frequent this outlet for team Friday night drinks. The outlet is situated in the end of custom house, you have a full view of Marina Bay Sands. Attractive happy hours until 7pm, with vast selection of margarita and beers. special call out to their Tuna ceviche, mushroom quesilades, crab on chip (forgot the name of the dish). Excellent service, drinks orders were delievered correctly and the staff is able to recommend drinks based on your requirement (had great tequila shots upon staff recommendation). You MUST try their corn on cob - it is worth the hassle of getting your fingers dirty eating it
4
Great spot for a drink after work . good tacos and quesadillas , prices are affordable. Staff and service are good too.
Will go back soon.
5
Off course, meal is good, in addition to traditional recipe, it is served with local foods. Location is also good, it is very nice scenic with marina bay.
3
View/location was fantastic. Menu looked good but the food was average. Nothing stood out. More bar food than a destination for great food. Music volume in the restaurant was too loud for easy conversation. Service was average.
5
Myself and my girlfriend with a couple of friends frequently visit super loco at customs house. With the Margarita perfectly served, pork belly that is so tender and savoury and the elotes (bbq corn) that is really delicious! It is hard to grab a table with a view of the mbs coz they are always booked. But they are flexible enough to attend to our request. The host didnt forget about us and came back to us when there was a table available. Overall experience is amazing. Great night, great view, great time with friends. Will sure comeback
5
I travel to Singapore regularly for work, so I dropped by this new establishment with my business associate. We didn't make a booking and were lucky to get front row seats located directly opposite the Marina Bay Sands. The restaurant was packed with people, so it would be advisable to make reservation. We were seated promptly even though we were placed on the waiting list. Mexican food was at its best. Most of the dishes were ordered, including the grilled seabass and steak was cooked to perfection! There was a great balance in flavours and the spiciness wasn't overpowering. They do provide their own homemade hot sauce if you are in need of some heat.Service was immaculate as the waitresses kept on checking on us on how we were were doing and if we needed anything else. Thumbs up!As the night falls, we enjoyed the light shows from the MBS and overall a great dining experience! Would recommend to my friends in Singapore for sure
5
One thing is lacking in the food establishment in Singapore,Service! Came here with a couple of friends and mind you the service,amazing. Food and drinks simply speaks fr itself. The servers here, always ready to assist n reccomend the best sellers on the menu. Will i be back? Definetely YES!
5
We came on a busy night, had to wait for a table to be available but they were prompt in finding us seats. The place had a fun vibe and the service is excellent, which is hard to come by in Singapore. We didn't know what to order but our server made good recommendations. We had the set menu and it was a good value. Our favourites are the corn and the steak. They also recommended a jug of pineapple margarita to share. We just felt that they really look after you and make sure you have a good experience from the food, drinks, and your overall dining experience. We are fans of this venue and will definitely keep coming back
4
Came here with friends who recommended it. Nice Location overlooking marina bay especially at night. Reminds me a little bit of Wahaca back in U.K. V busy but quieter as time wore on! Sat inside but outdoor option available.Had plethora of food but standouts for me were the soft shelled and habanero mol√É¬© .Decent wine list and Mojitos. Price wise not too bad. Service a bit lackadaisical hence not full marks
5
The location is superb, the view spectacular and the food excellent. We love Luca Loco, the sister restaurant on Duxton Hill. So we expected to enjoy it, but were mighty pleased our expectations were met. The fish taco and the pumpkin taco stood out for us. This new newcomer is a welcome addition to Singapore eateries and fair value compared to many others.
3
Visited on a weekday at lunchtime with a friend, and we both ordered the "long lunch", which is a 5-course set lunch for $55. The set lunch comprised corn on the cob (which the restaurant very kindly agreed to swap for us to corn in a cup), a taco, a tostada, a pearl barley salad and dessert. While there was enough to eat, we did not think the price was justified. Most of the food was pretty yummy, except for the salad which we both found rather bland. Dessert was an avocado Popsicle served on a stick. It was wrapped in a cheapo plastic bag when served, which was less than impressive.The service, while warm friendly and accommodating, was a little less than efficient. They forgot to serve our main course (the tostada), and in fact came over after a long pause after clearing our table of the appetizers to ask if we wanted our dessert. That left us feeling quite confused.Overall, we ate pretty good food, but we feel it was slightly overpriced. Service can also be improved
4
Tasty Mexican food. Great view. My favourites are the fish tacos and the beef quesadilla. Recommended!
4
I believe it's more suited for groups sitting indoors. If you need to talk, sit outdoors. Food portions can be smaller so order them like you are sampling them. The baked potatoes are very stomach filling so take note of that!
4
Food exceeded expectations. Lively atmosphere with excellent views of Marina Bay Sands. Good restaurant for large parties.
4
Food was great! We had tacos to share, and quesadillas individually. Service was average, but the view makes up for it.
4
Definitely a good place to chill on a Friday night with friends. Awesome Food, Service and Ambiance!
3
My wife and I went there after visiting Marina Bay. We seated outside, ordered and the waiter asked to my credit card. I have said to him that I would pay cash but he said that he needed my credit card and worst, he didn't say why. My wife would get out but we decided to stay to eat. In the end I asked for the bill and he brought the bill and my credit card without any commentary. Detail, there were another table near to us with 6 people and they didin,t need to give the credit card. I have found this really strange and I don't go back there anymor
3
great view - overlooks the river and Marina Bay Sands - so plus points for that. service is average. Sundown drinks promo ends at 7pm. cannot say much for the food. we only had chicken wings, chips and quesadilla - not great - just passable, for my taste. parking is easy and it's a cool area to come for drinks
4
Everything from the salsa's, ceviche, quesadillas and tacos were tasty. We ordered the Malbec which they served chilled and completely list the full body robust flavour this wine projects, but after mentioning this to the staff, they replaced it with room temperature wine which was great. Great views over Marina Bay and easy, relaxed atmosphere for any occasion.
5
Went here really are this week to meet a client and had a really great experience. The venue is right at the corner of Customs house overlooking the water and Marina Bay Sands see you really can't get a better view in Singapore. The margaritas are excellent, made with fresh lime and agave and plenty of tequila just the way I would make them for myself. We ordered the quesadillas which was delicious, the polls pork tacos which is a must try, and the chips with spicy salsa. The chips were great, but the spicy pineapple salsa was a bit strange Great energy, and great vibe with all of the office workers going there after work so everybody is well dressed and in the mood to drink and party. If you're looking for a place to go out with friends after work and have some great food and drink this is definitely highly recommended!
5
I cannot love this place enough! Used the Chope app to reserve seats, had awesome food and we were relocated because the weather changed pretty quickly. The tacos and quesadillas were awesome and the salsas for the corn chips were addictive! No service charge and a great atmosphere, it's now my favourite place in the CBD 
4
food is affordable and tasty. great for big groups too. nice vibe to the place. i remember the ribs being tender.
5
Ace Mexican restaurant. Not your usual crap. Everything really fresh. Red snapper dish especially good. Service a bit slow but I'll let them off as the food was so good.
4
This place is so packed on Friday nights. Fortunately, I managed a seat after waiting around for a while. Sea bass and ceviche are great, but the elotes is to die for! I had two, and will definitely be back for more.
4
The tacos are amazing. I ordered the vegetarian pumpkin taco and the fish taco. Both were well balanced, with a bit of heath and the fish was cooked perfectly. Also the view is great!
5
The lunch set is a great deal with 25 dollars including a salad, some corn dish and a fish taco. We sit outside on a cool day and the marina bay view is good too. Will come back again for sure.
4
Enjoyed a lovely evening at Super Loco. The salsa and the enchiladas were excellent. We ordered all four salsas - the pineapple and tomato were exceptional- the pineapple had a good Chilli kick whilst the tomato was very fresh with a roasted tang. The aubergine one was quite disappointing though. Great atmosphere and all in all a great evening.
5
Had a lovely lunch with a couple of friends & we certainly enjoyed the food! Every dish that came was sheer delight! I will especially recommend the seabass...it's out of this world!! The Sangria is to die for. Even the sorbet was fabulous. Am looking foward to my next visit already!
3
I reserved a table for 10 for a business diner at Super Loco via chope for 6.15pm. Around 6pm I realized that I'd be a little late, so I changed the reservation on Chope till 6.30. I was 5 mins late and arrived at 6.35pm and Super Loco had already given away my table. Apparently Chope did not update my new resevation time and the restaurant thought I'd was already 20 mins late. No one even called to say they were giving away the table! bad service.
4
It was s good chance to pop down to Singapore for a weekend visit and my friend suggested this place. I've never been before and was open to it.The dinner was for 4 people. We had the quesadillas, corn on the cob, and a few tacos (snapper n pork). All of which was very good but wouldn't say special nor great. I wasn't in the mood for a cocktail or a tequila and went for a bottle red. I know.. Strange choice for a Mexican style restaurant. But I was pleasantly surprised to see a decent 9-10 red wine choices.I think what made me give this a 4 star over a 3 star was the final dish. A nice whole seabass. It was cooked to perfection and though I'm rubbish at eating them, I finished it to the bare bones. Atmosphere was good and staff was efficient and pleasant. Would come again
5
Brought my good friend there to celebrate her belated birthday. Food wise was tasty - we ordered a Beef Torta and Prawn Torta - served on baguette. Price I think abit pricey. The ambience is bright and nice only music is slightly loud. But I will still go back to try other stuff as the menu is quite interesting
