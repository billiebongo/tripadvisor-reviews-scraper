The food was fantastic and the service was very good & fast. Only need to choose the level of spice in food carefully. My recommendation is to order mild.
5
Loved the food, if you know your curry you will love the place as it has a large menu. Cold beer and reasonable prices.
5
What great find. Reminded me of home cooked food. Exactly what i needed. Mutton breyani cooked to perfection. Scrumptious galic naan and butter paneer curry.
5
Spicy indian food what we expect from this place. The food is spicy and tasty. The biryani is really nice and the andra meal is also very tasty
4
Perfect for having a lunch in little India. The staff is very nice and friendly and the indian food is very good, You get a good value for your money.

Authentic Andhra Food restaurant. Both Veg and Non Veg. Food Taste is good, but short of delicious. Service is average.

Recommended for Hyderabad dum briyani, Naan and best customer service. My wife and I went there for dinner on Valentineâ€™s Day. It didn't disappointment :) Staffs are polite, friendly and accommodative. Sunil Kumar who have served us and I believe he could be manager for the restaurant made our dinner pleasant with his good customer service. Overall it is a nice ambience, authentic food taste and value for money

Went down to Little India for the Diwali celebrations on Saturday with my wife and two kids. After a nice walk through the markets we came upon Andhra. It looked like a "step back in time" or some places we'd actually visited in India so decided to give it a shot. The place is chaotic, but hey, so are most parts of India....it's part of the charm. They didn't have a table for us but took our number and said they'd call in 10 minutes. They didn't. So after 15 minutes we went back and just waited around like everyone else. After a table was cleared for us, we ordered. On the table there was the stainless steel flask of water, which clearly hadn't been wiped down in a few months. So we steered clear of that and the cups that went with it. We finally ordered and proceeded to wait. From sitting down to getting our food, it took 50 minutes. The frustrating bit was the haphazard way in which the food arrived. First a chicken curry arrived that we assumed was the 'butter chicken' for the children. It was incredibly spicy but the kids persevered. When we ask for rice they said "it's coming!"....but every 5 minutes they topped up the rice for the table next to us who were having Thali's. (Apparently that was the Thali rice bowl and ours was separate!) it was infuriating. Then bits and pieces dribbled to the table till we had a full order.....and as it turns out, the first dish wasn't the butter chicken and the poor kids had sweated through our Chicken Madras (we probably should have asked!!). On the plus side, it was an excellent curry. The Prata was the best I think I've ever had. On the down side, it's an authentic (ie dubious cleanliness) Indian restaurant with very slow service and an infuriatingly haphazard way of delivering your order to the table. I'll probably go back again for the Prata, but this time I'll allow plenty of time and maybe bring some Dettol wipes with me

The meal started slowly with a couple of appetizers not available. But the ones suggested we try were very good, and the main dishes were among the tastiest Indian food I have ever had.
5
Visited many times for lunch with friends.
Must try once by the Indian food lovers visiting around this area.

Good Andhra Restaurant. Will visit again in future and memorable time with friends and family. Will come back again.

Great restaurant with very helpfull staf. We just said that we wanted "a meal and not too spicy". We got very tasty Indian food with a good variety, yet a balanced meal.

After trying different foods, coming back to Andhra Curry for authentic andhra food is wow. Natu kodi curry is special
5
Me and 2 friends went for a late lunch and I'm vegetarian so everyone was happy.Great service by John and funny story: As I left, unfortunately, i forgot a very important envelope that contained all my per diem finances for 2 weeks in Singapore.Only ended up noticing I forgot it 24h later. Went back and not only they had kept it, it was perfectly safe and closed.I'm going once again and everyone should visit this nice restaurant.Great service, nice people and AMAZING food. :)Will definitely mention them on my YouTube channel: FabioFabs88 ✌

We have ordered Andhra Fish Pulusu, But they given me a Fish in different gravy which is taste less (No slat, No soreness and no spicyness). It is not at all andhra Style.we have Ordered around at 1.10, we got food at 1.40 which is too late.We will never visit this restaurent again.. Wasted my money :

Went to Andhara Curry after a Long time gap. Food was good but what I liked was that the manager who was taking our orders gave recommendations only when asked and never pressured us to order more than what we wanted unlike some Indian restaurants where the waiters ask you to try more dishes even when there are only 2 adults. Overall the experience was good

Went to Little India while in Singapore to find a good restaurant, but all the places along the main street were really, really crowded cafeteria style places. So, I went down a few side streets and stumbled upon this nice, clean, sit-down restaurant and had some of the best food I've ever had in Singapore. Service was good (for grumpy Singapore standards) and the food came fairly quickly. I had Chicken Tikki Masala and it was incredibly tasty. Since I was alone, another gentleman sat down at my table and he offered me a taste of his food. Wish i could remember what it was because it, too, was delicious.If I were staying in Singapore another day, I would come back to eat at this place again and again

We preferred not to eat at the market and were drawn to this restaurant by the polite welcoming staff at the door who explained the menu. We enjoyed the aircon after the haze outside. Had the best Prawn Gongura ever. The restaurant seems to be frequented by local business people which was a good recommendation. Bathrooms were not the best
4
They have various Indian regional food, air con, but costlier than street places. Air con and clean interior.
3
Had worst experience the food was not at all good. The food seems to have heated just before serving. Avoid to avoid terrible dinner or lunch experience
4
We just had tea here which was nice.. cannot comment in the food.. but the place had many guests so I guess food must be good too
1
Visited the recently and it will be the last visit.. Hell lot of improvements required .. Tables are not cleaned properly .. Service of the staff not good.. No Ambiance or look of restaurant .. Hopefully they will change for good ..
1
One man show, takes orders, serves slowly snd rudely and also settles your bills. Food is stale and lousy, raita was really stale and rest of the food just not decent enough. Absolutely not recommended..
4
if you are from hyderabad then u should definitely try this restaurant.its really amazing and will have the taste and feel of hyderabad.
4
Just near little india MRT,it is nice hotel with good staff and food is excellent and very economical(All less than 9SGD).We had Non-veg set meal,Chicken roast,Veg-set meal etc.etc.A/C is not enough as the doors are kept open,may be in summer it will be more cool.
5
It's was really worth the price and the dishes were very tasty ! Don't miss to try the fish pulusu and chicken briyani! Worth it
3
Food here tastes more like home made rather than hotel food. I loved the non-veg food here. Cost is reasonable too.
Not far from MRT. But its near to liquor shops, not suitable for families esp after evening during weekends.

Impressed with excellent reviews we decided to try out this place. I ordered a Thali which was supposed to include Naan, Special rice, Plain rice, Sweet besides veggies n dal, Sambar. Unfortunately it did not have naan, special rice or sweet. Thali came first with only veggies, steam rice a little later and drink ( Mango Lassi) was nowhere to be seen. When we enquires, the person who looked like the owner, replied " I am only one man, what all can I do". Lassi eventually came when dinner was done. Quality of food was pretty ordinary as well. Oho yo this place at your own peri

Loved the mutton curry here. Overall decent place with not very expensive food. Located in Little India.
2
I tried this restrauant after hunting for a good biryani joint at little India, eventually disappointed as it's too oily and hard meat(mutton). I would not recommend this to be the best as one who has eaten authentic hyderabadi biryani...
4
We enjoyed the Chicken Hyderabadi biryani although there wasn't very much meat. The mutton rogan josh was very good, though perhaps a little chewy.
For an Indian restaurant outside of India I thought they had the spice right and very tasty.
5
it is nice experience having a homely food with good service we feel that we r doing lunch in our home only

Andhra Curry came to our rescue while wandering Little India without adequate preparation and without adequate maps or guides. Although seldom an issue with respect to restaurant evaluation, the liveliness of the building itself--its spectacularly whimsical multi-color facade and variegated trim--will surely tickle any visitor who is not too hard of heart. We were greeted by a friendly bloke who reviewed the menu with us and initiated an amiable dining experience. Both of the dishes that we requested--the (admittedly somewhat cliche) butter chicken and a curried vegetable melange--were utterly delectable and, better, spiced to exactly the correct level. A good deal of pepper brought the subtle flavor profiles into the foreground without inundating the novice taste. The service itself was occasionally disorganized, with several waiters coming and going and several items being unavailable, but, somehow, this quaint bumbling mixed with undulating, ever-surprising flavors to produce a charming experience, from first entry to last bite

This was probably the nicest restaurant in Little India that we visited. After a not too good experience at Bismillah in the Muslim Quarter, we later explored Little India, just 5 - 10 minutes away. This gem, just 50 yards from the Little India MRT station, serves about the best food I had in Singapore. Leave the MRT and turn right into Kerbau Street and it's on the corner of Buffalo Road. Painted yellow, it's easy to find.It's clean, spacious and the food is great. Although I'll leave it as excelent, the service was a bit hit and miss and I had to ask for my Lassi three times,and was served sweet instead of plain after the second asking.However, I forgive them this as just after we arrived about 14 boisterous and loud customers arrived, fresh off the plane from India and there was some confusion, even with their order.The food was great. My mutton madras was plentiful and excellent - no bones, just flavour, and my fiancees mini thali was nice apart from the sambal. The naan bread was a little thin, but crisp and just about enough, although I prefer my naan thicker and softer.All in all, good value, clean and homely and above all, cheap and flavoursome

I was really excited when I came across Andhra Curry. I really enjoy Andhra Food and Hyderabadi Biryani. My wife, son and I went to this place on a Sunday for lunch. We ordered a South Indian Meal, Mini Meal and Hyderabadi Biryani. The first miss was the Andhra podis and ghee - the first thing any Andhra Restaurant would serve. Upon asking the they brought one podi but still no ghee. The second miss was the choice of vegetable curries in the Thali nothing was authentic Andhra. The third was the Biryani, the chicken in the Biryani was dry and not moist and soft as you would find in any Hyderabadi Biryani place. FINALLY and MOST importantly the Andhra spiciness was missing. To say the least the food was bland. The service was terrible as well. The servers sounded exasperated everytime we asked them something like we weren;t meant to be there or something.I wouldn't go back

This restaurant has literally saved me from becoming home sick during the first few years of my stay in Singapore. You will get good authentic telugu food and also some north indian and chinese items. However, I would only recommend this restaurant for having andhra/telangana preparations

If you are from Andhra Pradeah you can quickly give this restaurant a pass. At best you can treat this restaurant as a 3rd rated banana leaf restaurant.Neither the food tastes good nor does there quality. Can you imagine the server cleaning and picking up used plates and then serve you with the same hands with out washing his hands? You want to eat here?The food is cold except rice. I ordered a veg thali and the server took 15 mints to serve what was stale and per cooked. The owner of this restaurant should visit a andhra restaurant to know what it takes to cook and prepare Andhra Food.While they charge 9 dollars for this food,at best the quality you get to eat is worth 4 dollars. Through this review I want to tell the owners of this restaurant that Andhra Food is always served hot and supposed to be spicy. Don't dump stale sambar and rotten bendy fry on our faces for having committed a sin in visiting your restaurant. Please understand the curds in a Andhra Restaurant cannot be sticky.. Atleast you should know what it means to serve curds as part of Andhra thali. For people who want to enjoy a good Andhra Plate meals this is definitely not the right place. And for people who want to taste Andhra Food pl visit some other restaurant to know how Andhra Food tastes. Pl don't assume the food you get in Andhra Curry House as Andhra food
