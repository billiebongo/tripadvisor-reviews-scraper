Back here for the 3rd time and I really love the earl grey softserve with waffles! Will be back again :)
5
Yummmmmmmmmm - what else do I need to say. Seriously addictive - I was so tempted to go back the next day
5
There were a lot of people when I visited there.
Almost all people including me in the restaurant ordered ice-cream with waffle.
It tasted very nice!
5
We have visited this place many times and it never fails to make us happy. Good waffles and nice coffee..
5
Sunday Folks serves the best waffles in Singapore. Topped with a soft serve of pistachio ice cream, it is my favourite ice cream parlour!
4
We ordered the sea salt gula melaka ice cream with waffle which was really good. The place can get a little noisy at peak hours though.
5
Came here for a coffee.. Ended up with the waffles with icecream and hazelnut tiramisu trifle. Was super delicious. 😊
And a beer and watermelon chiller.
3
me and my friend was requested to change to another table when we were halfway waiting for our orders - was told that the existing table and the one next to it could accommodate the next customer with 6 pax. Fair enough, we agreed to change. After waited for 20 mins, we noticed that our orders were served to the 6pax table which means the waitress did not update the table number for our orders subsequent to the change. I think this is unacceptable because we were the one given up the table in the first place yet they got to eat first. And what more if we did not notice it and did not voice out to the waitress, then we will end up wait for another 20 mins (40mins altogether?!) Besides that, the waffle served was not hot anymore when it’s served. Service and quality of food had both deteriorated from my last visit in 2016.
3
Ordered the Earl Grey Lavender ice cream with waffles. Was expecting an ice cream texture but to find out it was soft serve instead. Hoping to have a stronger taste of earl grey or lavender but unfortunately it was mild. Waffles was decent. Will give this place another try
4
It’s surprising to see how this place is still able to garner such a crowd after so long. Was glad that I made a reservation as the queue was really long when my friends and I arrived. The downside was that there was a minimum spending of $10 per person due to the reservation. So think twice if you want to skip the queue by making a reservation.
5
Friendly staff and Ice cream great as ever. Particularly loved their salted caramel choc granola that complimented all flavors.
5
Cognac chocolate cake is to die for. Service is great and the cakes are incredible. Been at least 20 times.
5
love the soft serve and the waffles. the waffles were a little thin though, a little different from the usual thick fluffy Belgium waffles.
4
Repeated visit to sunday folks. Their waffles and earl grey lavender ice cream have never fail me.
This round i tried their new cake, white peach lavender chardonnay jelly cake. Surprisely it was super good.
5
It's a nice place to chill with friends to chit chat and enjoy the attractive food. Always make reservation online first before going. If not you will be wait wait wait...
4
The shop is a bit small and seats were very squeeze but they serve delicious cakes and ice cream especially earl grey lavender. Yummy!
4
Never fails to disappoint. Probably one of the best waffles on the island with unique ice cream flavours
5
One of the nice waffle and ice cream I have tried. Hard to get nice waffle like that. So. It is a must try. The only thing I wish to get improved is to allow credit card payment! They only take cash or nets which is rather unusual.
4
Our second visit there on a weekday afternoon and we were disappointed to find out that their weekday tea time menu (up to 4pm) does not include waffles (only available 4pm and presumably all day on weekends).We had a matcha chiffon white chocolate cake, dark chocolate ferraro ice cream (with chocolate cone) and a Liberty white coffee.Matcha chiffon white chocolate - interesting concept and nice design, taste-wise didn't feel as soft as one might want a chiffon cake to feel. Overall neutral about itDark chocolate ferraro ice cream cone - the whole group liked this ice cream and the mix with marshmallows on the top and cornflakes on the inside. The cone was very tasty, felt it was freshly made and they confirmed that it is made at one of their other outlets.The coffee was slightly disappointing though - the choice is between Papa Palheta (single source) and Liberty (blended, they say it is nuttier and bolder). I went with Liberty again, same as last time but this time it felt a bit sour. Disappointing too because I had the same previously and it was really good.The cafe itself has a very chill atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff, complemented by very colourful and interesting display of their cakes, tarts and chocolates. I would go there for the atmosphere and waffles.Note that there is a minimum charge of $20 for credit card usage
4
I visited this dessert cafe with my best friend after we had dinner in Holland Village. There was a long line at the entrance and the average wait was approx 20 minutes till a hostess would assign you a next available table according to the number of diners in your group. We waited for about 10 minutes (I guess we were lucky!) and ordered their Freshly Baked Waffles with Gula Melaka Mochi, Caramelised Almond Thins, Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce && Vanilla Soft Serve ; Lemongrass Cucumber Infusion Tea ; Homemade Summer Iced Tea . Everything arrived in about 10 minutes, tasted amazing and a worth the wait! #n
4
Sunday Folks is nominated as the Best Dessert. No surprise to arrive with a long queue waiting. Must try: a plate of double thick waffles with earl grey lavender ice cream!
4
as usual it was very crowded & noisy during weekends but the cake, ice-cream & waffles is splendid!!
5
Cake was moist and freshly baked. Pistachio ice cream was perfect! Lavender didn't go well with the chocolate drink though..
4
Nice relaxing place that serves desserts only. The desserts are pretty good & different from the usual stuffs.
5
I have been to Sunday Folks several times previously and always loved their waffle with sea salt gula melaka ice cream. It never disappoints.
4
Battled the weekend crowd for some yummy waffles and soft serve! Luckily I could make a reservation via chope and avoided the long wait.Seating is a bit cramped as they have a lot of small tables and mostly stools instead of comfortable backed chairs. Food took about 20 mins to come and the soft serve was slightly melted unfortunately. The waffles were crisp on the edges and fluffy inside, perfect to soak up all the ice cream. I liked the earl grey lavender best.
4
Place was recommended by a friend and i really like the setting and the waffles are yummy. Ice cream is also different as it is in soft serve!!! They have like asian fusion flavour like sea salt gula melaka and unique earl grey lavender ... Pricing is value for money
4
The waffles at Sunday Folks is one of the best I've tried so far, crispy on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. It complements well with the Lavender soft serve ice cream which is ever so refreshing and provides such a balanced overall taste to this dessert
4
We had the waffle with gula melaka, pistachio and lavender ice cream. We ordered extra ice creams for add-ons. One scoop of ice cream is never enough on a waffle! :P The waffle by itself is pretty good - crispy and baked just right. A waffle with ice cream will never go wrong ; however I do find the gula melaka ice cream ( which is their signature ) to be somewhat mediocre at best. The lavender and pistachio ice cream on the other hand was great and goes well with the waffle. Price wise I will say it's fairly reasonable and hence it gets extremely crowded during peak hours. It's filled with youngsters and families which can make the noise level very unbearable, so my advise is to come during non-peak timings or weekdays to enjoy your desserts
5
Waffles with ice cream were awesome! I particularly love the earl grey flavour.They seem to have changed their menu slightly though. During my previous visits, toppings were optional and at an additional charge. However now the toppings are included with their waffles and ice cream, albeit at a slightly higher price. Found the toppings slightly sweet and wish there was an option not to have the toppings.It can get quite crowded during peak periods so be prepared to wait. I made a reservation via chope so I got a seat immediately. Take note that for reservations there is a minimum spending of $10 per person
4
This dessert cafe is located near holland village, they serve pretty good desserts. If you happen to visit them, do try their signature sea salt gula meleka ice cream!
5
One of the best ice cream waffles in town! Place was incredibly crowded and definitely for a reason. Waffles were as tasty and good as they look. Definitely worth a return visit!!
4
Never been a big fan of waffles but my friend decided to bring me here and I'm glad to say it is really good and worth the wait. I plan to head back again to try the other variations. Price-wise, it was reasonable.
5
Not a fan of gula melaka thus the rating for the food!
Perhaps in the future I'll get pistachio instead! Atmosphere is awesome! I'll come back again!
3
Good waffles with ice cream, but service staff weren't friendly. Also unhappy about the $10/head min spend to earn the Chope$!
5
The desserts served were yummy. Loved the atmosphere there too! Would recommend Sunday Folks to everyone.
4
Reservation is recommended although there is a minimum spending required. Indoor seating available but it can get rather noisy. Place order using menu sheet and pay at counter.
Great place for waffle, ice cream and coffee
3
I’m a long term customer of sunday folks. However I have never been to sunday folks during peak hour. Normally sunday folks are pretty generous of the ice cream, but this time round when i went there, the serving size of the ice cream are lesser than usual... would hope sunday folks work on their quality even during busy hour
1
A bunch of inexperienced staff who gave away my table to a walk in stating that they couldn’t seat me even though I had a Q number because “my guests were not there” Avoid this place. To the owner, let me suggest some training for your staff
4
Went to the sister outlets at TPY before. The waffles is the must try item there. The concept of Sunday Folks are more high end that Creamier. Tried the limited time raspberry meringue cake, tasted good with sour and sweet combination. Next, is the single soft-serve with waffle, we choose earl grey lavender. Very unique taste. The cafe's interior is nice. Food rice are more expensive compare to creamier.The only drawback is the cafe is too crowded and it might be quite noisy if you prefer some quiet environment.They also sale chocolate and some biscuits. You can also buy the coffee bean there if you like it
5
Great place to catch up with friends over tea. Love the sea salt caramel ice cream over the waffle and the Yuzu cheesecake. All the cakes taste good! Will go again!
5
Not my first and won't be my last. Excellent service, attentive staff, cleanliness, delicious desserts.
4
Awesome ice cream / dessert place. Love their salted gula melaka ice cream with waffle. Its super awesome.
5
Good waffles and ice cream.
Be prepared to wait as they make everything fresh... very noise though because of the crowd.
Better to make a reservation than to wait in line.
4
one of the best waffles.. nice and cosy ambience.. but a little too noisy when crowded.. soft serve is excellent and not too sweet...
5
We've enjoyed every dessert we've ordered especially the Lime & Mango Jelly Cake, it was refreshing & tasty! All the ice creams were smooth and rich too, must try!
4
This cafe situated near Holland Village serves nice dessert items. This place is usually crowded and.
5
The space was packed but the food is still good. Ice cream standard dropped a little from last visit though still good.
4
It was really crowded when we went so thankfully we made reservations. The lavander soft serve was quite a lot sweeter than we previously had. But overall still worth a visit for your waffle fix :)
3
This place is a good hang out place for young people and it's always crowded. You need to queue for 15 min for your seats. The Earl grey lavender ice-cream is nice but feel a bit cheated as inside the swirl it is hollow, not filled with ice-cream.
3
Nothing fantastic. Long queueing despite reservation made. Minimum spend is required. Service quality was worst. Won't go back again.
4
Wait was short thanks to chope.sg!! The ice-cream waffles tasted decent just that overall it was too sweet for the palate.
4
Had waffles, ice cream and cake here.... waffles is average for I have tasted better ones in Singapore but ice cream and cake is good. Their biscotti is nice too I felt.
4
This was not my first visit to the Sunday Folks, and as expected, the food was really good :) The service was better than what I expected as well. Would definitely come back again.
5
The ice cream waffle was good. Ordered the Yuzu cheesecake but wasn't as impressed with it. Perhaps will try the matcha chiffon cake next time.
5
Nice food. Just that the indoor is noisy and I personally prefer to sit outdoor. Quiet and don't need to speak loud. :/
4
Good dining experience as usual. The good old flavor and ambience. Old is gold certainly. Recommended. Thanks you.
5
Not my first time there, but this place has really good ice cream! Must try their Earl Grey Lavender
5
Excellent waffles one could hope for, pair with delicious ice cream like the dark chocolate & mango is the best👍🏻👍🏻
3
Still loving the soft serve ice cream as ever. However, the portions of toppings hv gotten smaller and toppings are now standardised and not free to choose anymore. Servers wise, indifferent and robotic. Some servers seemed more inclined to chitchat among themselves than serving customers proper.
3
Menu changed. Wish there were more selections of waffle combo. Wasn't allowed to order just a plain waffle without the icecream on top of another set that's already ordered. Very noisy
5
very good i love the ambiance and food there especially the pistachio ice cream. Will definitely visit here again
5
Very good dessert place that serves not only yummy but pretty ice cream and cakes. Love their affogato too
3
Good customer service and food presentation especially for waffles with soft serve ice cream. Taste of food was not as great for the price tag.
4
A bright and cheery place. Having waffles and/or ice cream here always never fails to lift up my mood.
5
Good ambience, service and food! Not my first time here. Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends.
5
Located in a quiet neighborhood but accessible by public transport and ample parking space, this place offers the right environment to relax and enjoy and treat yourself to delicious waffles and soft serve ice cream. Many Instagram worthy photos to be taken there as well.
5
One of my favourite go to places for ice cream, waffles and cake. Everything there is so good. Now that I can book on chope it makes it even better!
5
We had the Salted Gula Melaka and Earl Grey ice cream flavours with waffles, and they were absolutely delicious. We were also seated very quickly and staff also very patiently explained the menu items/changes to us.One thing they could improve on: The aircon was freezing, and it was blasting down directly on us and the table next to us. We were seated next to the display shelf by the wall. The couple next to us asked the waiter if the aircon could be adjusted but it wasn't
3
Ok I was greeted by a warm n friendly staff, she even offered me to let her know if I need help on the ordering as I was alone with my 2.5yrs old Son. In term of the restaurant management, I somehow find they r lacking of it. The food was slow and I thought because it was due to peak hours but I revisited few days later on one of the weekdays afternoon, the restaurant was abt 30% crowd, I would expect my order would be pretty fast, unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment! I ordered two sets, one with ice cream and the other set with cake, and only cake was served, the drinks n ice cream again took ages to come. The most frustrating part is after a Long wait, finally came a waiter informing me that something wrong with their coffee machine and I need to wait for another 15-20mins. Thanks for it man! Anyway I would consider again whether I will go there again provided if I want to try other flavour of their ice cream.
5
Nice & cosy ambient! Loving the earlgrey lavender soft serve flavor. Oh! And then best part is they serve plain water!!!! This is really one of my go to place whenever I need a quick dessert fix!
5
Dessert was good. Wide variety of cakes and beverage. Look forward to trying other flavora of soft serve
4
the long lines testify to its popularity amongst young people. Crisp waffles wiih your choice of toppings and ice cream make this a nice place for an evening after dinner treat.
5
arrived 45mins earlier than booked time. Requested if i could be seated earlier if my table is ready and to my surprised they said my table is ready and can be seated.
4
Foods is good, environment is good.
Only down side is the is the ordering system.
Will come back again with my friends
4
The food was served very quickly and was above expectation. Prices are decent with each main course comprising of a free drink.
A little disappointed in the lemonade which was just a normal fizzy drink but priced at S$5.50 each.
5
Awesome service, menu items, and atmosphere. Considered affordable for a stall in Holland V. Always coming back :)
4
What better way to cool down on a hot day than having an oh-so-yummy soft serve paired perfectly with a crispy tasty waffle! The seasalt gula melaka flavour and honeycomb topping are my all-time favs at this spinoff from the first shop, Cremier, which specializes in ice-cream. ;
5
We went here to today in Holland Village as we head that this place had great icecream and we were not disappointed it was worth the journey. We had the dark chocolate in a waffle cone for $7.90 and it 2as very enjoyable. They gave many other desserts and flavors but as this place is very popular you need to book ahead or get there early.
5
First visit and I am sure there will be many more repeat visits.The freshly baked waffles were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. We ordered the sea salt gula melaka soft serve which was velvety and not sweet, the way we prefer. Both of us shared the order of 2 stack of waffles + soft serve + one topping which came up to $13 + GST. We were not imposed the minimum $10 per person spend rule that other reviewers mentioned.Place is cosy with good vibe and friendly wait staff
5
Best waffles n ice cream!
Coffee n cakes are delicious too!
Small cafe thou but great service!
Thumbs up!
2
There's a minimum cover of $10 per person -- which means two people can't share a regular serving of waffles with ice cream ($13.90). Not worth visiting with this ridiculous rule in place.
4
Sister cafe of creamier. Just that Sunday folks offer soft serve ice cream in a classier setting (and 7% GST). Common point is their equally tasty waffles!
4
The earl grey ice cream is a must try flavour, you won't want to miss it. It is good that they partner with chope reservation to avoid the long waiting time! Can't wait for the next trip again.
5
Yummy soft serve, interesting flavours. Just really love the vibe here! So many variety of toppings to choose from (: makes me feel like a kid again!
4
It is a very nice place for premium ice-cream. Great gathering place for friends and family to go to.
5
New menu up. Staff recommend us to join app to get discount. Always my choice when it comes to waffles.
5
This place has always been my favorite place for soft-serves. The salted caramel and the roasted pistachio flavors are the winners.
4
The staff were very friendly and efficient. The food and coffee were good as well. Would definitely go back again!
5
Waffles with Sea Salt Gula Melaka soft serve with strawberries at the side. It's amazing how Sunday Folks honours the waffle by giving it a crisp outer layer and yet maintaining a soft and fluffy interior. Two waffles on top of another, topped with a generous serving of sea salt & gula melaka soft serve which has a slight smoky richness because of the gula melaka.Not forgetting staff members that greet you with a smile
5
Had the waffles with dark chocolate ice cream - really great taste and service was prompt. Not exactly wallet friendly though!
4
The waffles are something you never get tired of! I've been loyal to Sunday folks for over 2 years now
5
I LOVE THIS PLACE. I will want to go there again with my friends. The wait is not that long but it will be better if the wait is shorter.
5
Best soft serve and waffles so far, though always crowded and noisy. I reserved seats through 'Chope' app and got my seats as soon as I walk in - but you'll be required to spend at least $10 per pax.
5
Wonderful crisp waffles with yummy ice cream Flavours. The salted chocolate honeycomb topping is a fave
5
tried the new flavour adzuki for desserts. the flavour was slightly bland but waffles was good as usual!
5
My third time visiting this place. Doesn't disappoint at all. Have yet to tried everything on the menu. Will be back to try them all!
5
Yummy waffle with tasty ice cream. Great place for a lazy time out to just watch time and world go by. Toppings to try include honeycomb and gula melaka mochi. Ice cream to try include earl grey lavander, pistachio and sea salt gula melaka. May get crowded and squeezy on weekends though.
4
The atmosphere is a great place to relax with close friends and family members. I have visited the cafe several times. The food and candy bar is awesome, delicious and mouth-watering. The portion of the waffles is just right. Great flavours and variety of ice cream too. Also, the service provided was good. However, I felt that they could have much improvement in terms of the opening hours and amount of seats. The seats are not many hence it is not suitable for big families. Also, Sunday Folks only opens on certain days. I felt that the opening hours should have been more regular, for example opening everyday. There should have also been more outdoor seating. Overall, Sunday Folks is still a great place for tea
4
The place is away from the crowd. The ice-cream flavoura are a delish (you can sample first before ordering) and the waffles are freshly made. Price are reasonable. Definitely will come back again! On a side note, they only accept cash so make sure you have sufficient amount
5
This place has queues on friday and saturday nights and rightly so! It has unique handmade desserts which are beautifully presented and very tasty too!
We had the hazlenut ice cream, trifle, banana and walnut cake as well as the waffle!
Great place!
Regards
Omar
4
Unique flavours for soft serve ice cream. A little pricy though. Cakes are not that great, so just go for the ice cream (earl grey lavender & pistachio) and waffle.
4
Sunday Folks serves delicious and highly instagramable dessert and coffee. They also provide good customer service.
5
Sigh I just LOVE their gula Melaka ice cream. Even on rainy days I still crave for it. Goes super well with the waffle. Would definitely go back
5
Good ambience, coupled with nice music :) Food was yummy too! Service was slightly long(15-20 mins), but all in all, love it!
4
Definitely a unique place for desserts! The ice cream and waffle are tasty and full of flavour. However, the cafe is way too crowded, not a place to stay for long to chat with friends.
4
The pistachio and sea salt gula melaka flavours are a MUST try! Best when coupled with their fragrant fluffy waffles. Although slightly pricey for simply ice cream, the lovely ambience and quality of the desserts somewhat make up for it hence I highly recommend trying at least once
4
I always loved the ice cream here especially being a regular of Creamier. I definitely love the ice cream and waffles though as nothing can beat creamier derived ice cream. Really love it. However, the service can definitely be better as compared to the really great and friendly service at Creamier. Yesterday, even after waiting outside for quite awhile, nobody bothered to come to the door. And even after entering the store + having a reservation, we just got ignored until I stopped someone to mention that I have a reservation. I understand that it can get busy but the store wasn't even full, and there were staff that were free but just ignored our presence. An acknowledge of presence would've been nice, as we would've not minded patiently waiting. And the table you conveniently gave us wasn't that great with all the traffic, especially since there were so many other tables for 2 available. I felt like y'all were being selective with service. Nevertheless still 4 stars as the ice cream and waffles never fail and had a good experience with the serving of food and cashier. And 2 out of 3 times the service is good so... yeah.
5
We had a Baptism Tea-Party here last Sunday. As there were 12 of us, we made reservations ("chope") a few days before....and thankfully we did!The place was packed when we arrived after 4pm; it was buzzing a and very vibrant (young crowd)Our orders included waffles & ice-cream: you can create your own with different flavours and toppings; sodas & floats; teas & lattes.Top of the charts would be Waffles & ice cream, with winning flavours being Pistachio, Dark Chocolate and Vanilla. For toppings try the seasalt honeycom strawberry, caramel marshmallow and Gula Melaka.Complete your sweet endings with a nice hot cup of Earl Grey.At last, somewhere to go for endless creations (your own) of desserts!
3
Didn't like the waffle. It was a little too hard. Didn't like the ice cream. It was too sweet. I prefer creamier texture. Everything is a little overprice. But the setting is nice n I enjoyed the warm staff service, free flow of water, decor and the whole cosy atmosphere. Great place for a friends catch-up
5
Amazing experience, The waffle and ice crean are the best ive tasted so far, will definitely come back again
5
Was there on a Sunday night and there was a queue outside. I'm glad I made reservations! The atmosphere was lovely and the food did not disappoint at all.
5
really love the waffles here! ambience and location are both great with fast and hospitable service.
4
I would eat the waffles plain, without ice cream. They're good enough on their own, and the ice cream is a bit too sweet for me.
4
A little noisy that i could barely hear myself speaking. Tables were too closely packed and they clear our plate really quickly as though to chase u out of the cafe when u are done
5
Best waffles and soft serve that you could find. Love love love the pistachio soft serve. Waffles are one of the best in singapore.
4
Sunday Folks, being the sisters brand to Creamier, needlesa to say, their waffles was awesome, cripsy on the outside, fluffy inside. Topped with their home made sauce and creative toppings, price paid was definately worthy!
4
Sunday Folks is a bustling place with tasty and instagramable waffles, cakes and coffee. Be prepared to queue during peak hours.
5
This is my 3rd time back here, but 1st time for lunch. can never get enough of their artisan flavoured ice creams, fluffy waffles and unique cakes/ toppings. The white coffee was fabulous too. Popular place no matter the time of the day, so come early or do bookings for large groups
4
It was our first time visiting, and it helped to make a reservation for a friday night trip. The food was great - waffles were fluffy yet crispy on the outside, and the earl grey lavender ice cream was the best choice for a first visit. I felt the ordering system could have been improved by digitalising the process, especially since the place seems to be attracting a bigger crowd than when it first started. It was noisy (as expected on a friday night), which made the experience not as great as I hoped it would be, but I imagine it will be a lot better on a quiet weekday afternoon. Staff were helpful and patient, always putting on smiles
5
good ice cream, a little crowded over the weekend. use chope to make reservations to guarantee a seat
3
The hype was real, in terms of crowd. However the food was average. The waffles were nice buy not mind blowing as many said. Prices are are quite alright. An average meal would set you back about 30$ a person.
5
We were very pleased by the service , the staff are friendly Price were very valued and we loved the atmosphere there
5
Loving the food, atmosphere at sunday folks. Price is very affordable and food was really good. Highly recommended.
4
Was early for the booking but appreciate that seats were available even before our booking slot. First time using Chope to make a reservation, and all is good.
5
Went for my bf 21st as he wanted a quiet celebration. So glad I booked seats beforehand as it was 31st Dec and there was a crowd queue for about 30-45 minutes! Shows how famous they are! Good service and delectable food! Thanks!
5
The ice cream waffles served was fabulous and reasonably priced. Ambience and service was good too! Will definitely visit again
4
Good located at Holland Village and walking distance from MRT.
Nice and Cosy environment. Perfect for Group Gatherinf
4
Waffles + Sea Salt Ice Cream is very good.We came in a big group, they do not allow us to open a tab. Everything have to be done manually, after which at the counter, they copy our orders into another piece of paper. Too much paperwork and holding up the queue for too long
2
This place is all about ice cream + waffles. But these 2 food items did not come through, more like the hype and marketing made it popular? Personally I prefer the crispy light airy waffles at Atlas and previous their shop at Evans lodge. Waffles at Sunday folks are thick heavy and nothing wow. Soft serve is really sweet and nothing wow as well. So honestly, I'm disappointed :( Best part- the double shot coffee from Liberty. Perhaps it's better to market itself for coffee? Deco was def great. Tap built into "wall" panel for water was creative
4
Our to go place for desserts after dinner at holland village every single time. Sundau folks has never disappointed. All flavours are good. Waffles are delicious.
4
I came here with my boyfriend and his mom and we had a relaxing time here - eating the earl grey lavender ice cream and the waffles. Its my first visit here and i enjoyed the food.
5
was attended to immediately by staff. Table was already prepared way before hand. Not my first my time
5
waffles and soft serve are such a great combination. restaurant was packed, but service was good. waitress explained the menu and ordering process. beautifully plated dish.will be noisy during weekends.
4
This godly combo of waffles and ice cream is a must try. Highly addictive and going just once won't be enough!
5
The waffles and earl grey lavender ice is as good as ever. My all time favourite! Place was not too packed as it was raining.
4
Everything was in order! They called to confirm the reservation.. and when I've reached, I need not wait!!! Waffle, ice-cream and cake were all good!!
4
Overall a lovely place but the tables are placed too near to each other. The couple beside us couldn't get a room and had to resort to snogging inches away from us. This is an amazing feat considering the place was packed and full and noisy which is the case with all new chic coffee places as there is not enough plush furniture to absorb the sound. All that chic Danish inspired furniture. Full of wood n concrete actually reflect sound making it very noisy. Oh.. but what do I know..
5
It is one of the few cafes who know how to pair desserts with coffee and teas. You will see six soft serve ice cream flavors on the menu. Coffee beans were from Liberty Coffee's Speakeasy blend and a single origin from Papa Palheta. Cakes are also available on the display! My first visit but wouldn't be my last.
5
I'm not a dessert lover, but i'm loving this place! That should sum everything up. For singaporean and dessert lovers, the sunday folks are not a newbie for the business, being one group with the sesones creamer dessert place.Located in the 'outskirt' but very convieniently within the walking distance from the holland village MRT stop. Be prepared to wait in a long Q line specially in their busy hours.The waffle is a perfect match for the ice cream. Try their house special the sea salt gula malaka - quite a funny but well balanced combination (strangely). As for the cake menu, we tried the lemon lavender cake and loving every bite.If you're a dessert lover, this place is a must try
4
Great place to chill as usual. With great standard of food. However do reserve to avoid disappointment.
5
Wide variety of choice for soft serve and waffles was good. Great dessert for friends to share. The staff were also friendly and helpful in assisting with order. Overall, a delightful experience, will go again!!
Highly recommended!
5
Second visit to Sunday Folks and the experience was as awesome as before! Kudos to the staff for their excellent service and smiles all around.
3
The Earl Grey Lavender flavour ice cream is so damn nice and smooth. Overall is good but service a bit weird.
4
Place is moderate in space. Tables and chairs well placed with sufficient walking space. Staff are friendly and desserts are worth a try. They have season specials and it was a good after dinner treat!
5
The waffles and ice cream never disappoint (: Always wanted to go back for waffles. Really recommended

Food was wonderful, but halfway through, they started blasting the aircon. We were already eating icecream and the aircon directed in our faces was not a good experience

Sunday Folks serve good waffles with wide range of toppings. It also has nice store decor. Queues can get quite long though.

The cafe was by the people behind creamier. Instead of ice cream, the cafe specialized in soft serve. Only cash and NETS payment was accepted here. Help yourself to the water from tap from the counter. This christmas the cafe offered 2 limited desserts and 3 dessert sets.Winter Yuzu Ice Cream Trifle (S$12)Limited to 10 servings per dayThe dessert used Japanese Yuzu which is a lemon sized fruit with a distinctive, delicate citrus perfume, in season during winter and traditionally used in Japan during the winter solstice. Layered with soft sponge cake and citrus cookie crumbles, the rich indulgent taste of the Madagascan Vanilla ice cream contrasts with the citrus zing of Yuzu gel and light acidity of fresh strawberries. Crowned with a stalk of fresh edible Shiso hanaho flowers. Freshly prepared upon order.Looked simply pretty, it tasted with a zing.Pistachio Chocolate Ice Cream Gateaux (S$12)A double layer of dark chocolate and roasted pistachio ice cream with a red berries sorbert surprise. Encased within an intense bittersweet dark chocolate shell and bedecked with a dallop of Varlhorna Azelia ganache, gold flakes, burnt caramel rice puff brittle and crushed roasted pistachio nuts.A mixture of flavours in the mouth with the rich creamy ice creams, and the intense sorbert.Lemongrass Cucumber Infusion ($6.50)Rehydrate with this refreshing infusion packed with chia seeds, fresh cucumber peels and lemongrass.Tasted like the usual lemongrass drink but with the crunchy chia seeds.Best come early. Although it was just noon, the place was packed

None of their desserts could possibly be lacking. Their warm and crisp waffles with soft serve refreahing earl grey to contrast was delightful. I tried a few of their Christmas goodies and they were all yummy. The caramel was tad too sweet for hubby but i got the pistachio cranberry biscuit. Also took away a lemon lavendar cake which was recommended to eat warm. Very heart warming dessert indeed.The cafe was busy for a Tuesday afternoon. Hard for heart-to-heart talks

Love the waffes and soft serve here. Only drawback is that it tends to get crowded and wait time goes up to an hour. Worth it nonetheless!

Visited this place for the 2nd time and totally loving it!!
Staff greeted us cheerfully, service was prompt and fast, food was yummy!
Highly recommended :)

I love the pistachio and earl grey lavender soft serve. Its not my first time there, been going back many times now.
4
nice waffle. crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. paired with the lavender soft serve tasted well. but the soft serve itself not the best, but not bad either. rather pricey overall
5
Staff called to confirm reservation for table of 9. Staff were friendly. Food did not take long to arrive. Cakes were delish! Prices were reasonable for the good quality food.

great dessert place.. nice dessert, ambience a bit noisy but cosy.. staff are very patient and attentive.. but waited 15 mins for my coffee to be served..

Heard about this place so decided to come here for desserts.We ordered two regulars. Each came with two waffles, one with Roasted Pistachio topping and Dark Chocolate ice cream, the other with Peppermint Marshmallow topping and Earl Grey ice cream.The waffles were delicious: a little crispy and yet soft on the inside. The ice creams were not too sweet, just right for the waffle.The place was not crowded when we arrived about 7:15pm; at least there weren't a queue waiting to be seated.Price of the waffles were affordable; if they price it a little lower it would have been more value for money, though.Overall, worth a visit. Though I wouldn't say it's worth queuing up for
5
Decided to come here again and get the waffles!Ordered a single scoop of their Earl Grey ice cream (again) with one waffle. Just absolutely delicious. The ice cream was really fragrant and the waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. One of the staff was really friendly and explained their new menu to us!Of course, definitely recommending this place
5
Waffles were great - double scoop of ice cream with two waffles. They had just the right amount of fluffiness. Service was quick around 7pm. Don't expect peace and quiet to have long deep conversations, it does get crowded and lively when the after dinner crowd gets in

This cafe is hidden on a small street close to Holland Village. Unless you are coming here on purpose it's unlikely you will come across it. It serves a great selection of tasty cakes and ice cream . It's many customers keep the staff busy at all times. The staff was helpful and guided me through the many options available. An ice cream cone will set you back close to 8 sgd. A waffle with three toppings and ice cream is 18 sgd I will return for sure.

Ice cream was great, with reservation a minimum of $10 spending each is needed. And we just had a feast for our dinner. Sad to say I have to spend for the number I have with me despite eating or not.

Waffles at Sunday folks never disappoints me. What's good for me: earl grey ice cream; almond crisp.

Sunday Folks serve good waffles with ice cream and wide selection of toppings.
Nice atmosphere and crowd.

best earl grey lavender ice cream in town. Good for groups but recommend to make reservation or go early to avoid waiting time.

Came here with a group of friends after dinner one evening for dessert and it was a good choice. The cakes are yummy. The pancakes too. A little pricey but that doesn't seem to turn people away. Long queue.

They have a creative flavours of ice cream - dark chocolate, pistachio, sea salt gula Melaka, earl grey lavender. I feel that the quality and flavour of the ice cream isn't that great after some time. Seems to have gone down since they were opened. Consistency of the waffles tend to range a little especially when there's a queue. Undercooked and not crispy on the outside. It's somewhat off-putting considering the amount you pay for these waffles, the time you wait for it and out comes a substandard waffle. They've got a queue system for the weekends, if you're heading to the area to eat, come early or halfway through your meal, get a queue number. Staff will call your mobile or the queue system will send a message to your handphone. Not much service involved, pretty much automated. Tables are a little small and close to one another, so there's not much privacy. There's free water with a cute spout in the middle of the room. I enjoy the handcrafted sweets by them, lately it's the sea salt chocolate coated honey comb, pocky sticks with popping candy and handmade almond thins.Packaging for dark choc sea salt honeycomb used to be in a plastic bottle which prevents it from crumbling, but it's now in a plastic bag. Not so air tight, but I usually pop it into the fridge to prevent it from degrading rapidlyNot sure if the handcrafted sweets are seasonal, they used to have chunky caramel marshmellow, raspberry marshmellow and passionfruit marshmellow. Hope they'll come up with new ones soon

Sunday Folks is a "super-hyped" soft-serve ice-cream/waffles joint in Singapore and we were super-keen to make the trek to give it a go. The restaurant "get-up" is beautiful and attractive looking with a modern/cozy feel to it, but, location-wise, is not centrally located for the tourist so you will need to grab a cab to get there if staying in the Orchard Rd area. The menu itself and the options are "tantalising" and "eye-catching", and we were blown away by the concept - which included 5 choices of different soft-serve ice cream, either served in a waffle cone, cup and/or along with freshly baked waffles, in addition to a choice of a slice of several artisanal cakes with interesting flavours (e.g. lemon lavender, cognac chocolate etc...) and some decent espresso coffee. On top of that, you have the option to build-your-own dessert, so you can garnish your ice-cream/waffles dessert choice with several interesting topping choices, and a choice among a number of sauces (including maple syrup, butterscotch). Sounds good... We tried (i) the salted caramel ice-cream on a waffle cone (high quality soft-serve texture, with excellent consistency but lacking a bit of the salted-caramel taste which was dissapointing) and (ii) Madagascar vanilla soft-serve on waffles with butterscotch sauce and a few trimmings, including strawberries and caramelised popcorn (great ice-cream but average waffles and the dish, overall, didn't quite work and just seemed to be a hodge-podge of ingredients). What drove us insane the most was the service - the system they have is ridiculous in that to get your ice-cream fix - you get given a piece of cash register receipt paper with a table number, you then have to walk to the counter, place your order and pay first, and then wait about 15-20 minutes for your order to be delivered to your table - this is *unacceptable*. Worst of all, if you want to order more food, you have to go back through the above process of lining up and paying and waiting - what a joke and what a let-down. The pricing itself seemed a bit on the pricier side of things, and you also have to pay in cash or "nets" (so be prepared). I get the concept and what Sunday Folks are trying to achieve, but they need to work on it a bit better because I genuinely believe there are possibilities here for something great

Came here with 5 friends and got seats quite easily even though it seemed packed. Good electronic queue system and service, very quick serving. I got the petite waffle with 3 toppings and ice cream (dark chocolate) and it was very good. The ice cream was creamy and very chocolate my, I got the honeycomb, caramel popcorn and gula melaka sauce. Everything on there fit well! Go nuts people!Good place to chill, decently priced and good service.
5
Was searching for some dessert place and chance upon sunday folks.The queuing system is electronic and a queue number will be sms to you once you completed to register for your group.Those the choice are not too many but the range is enough to still make you undecided .Will definitely visit Sunday Folks again

My friend convinced me this is one of the best waffles in Singapore. This is a big statement for a self-proclaimed waffles die hard. We both shared a double waffles with ice cream, and I would rate it 8/10!! Tasty and fluffy waffles, I like my waffles with taste even without the ice cream. Perhaps because it was soft serve, the ice cream seemed to melt faster than I expected so we had to speed eat! There was almond and matcha add ons as well, both were tasty and added good flavour! Would definitely come back again, but likely at a quieter time, cos it was fully packed
5
I went into this place with mixed thoughts. I am delighted to report that I was very much mistaken. This dessert store should not be so low down. The waffle was great with the ear grey and lavender ice cream. Subtle flavours and all good.
5
Loved their pistachio ice cream with waffles ! Great texture especially when you add the cornflakes, almond thins and home made granola. My go to spot every weekend

This is a wildly popular soft serve ice cream parlour in Holland Village. With queues usually out the door, limited opening hours and slow service, we stayed away for about a year after getting a take away one evening.At the last minute I decided to pop round today to see if the ice cream was still good and it is. Ordered the pistachio cone to go - the ice cream had a good flavour, the roasted pistachio nut topping and chocolate flavoured cone complimented nicely.It still takes a while to order (partly due to indecisive customers) and there's about a 5 minute wait to get your confection after ordering. The crew is young and enthusiastic - one of them opened the door for me on my way out which was very sweet. At S$7.50 (USD5.50) for an ice cream cone, this is pretty expensive stuff. The product has been been consistent though, they've ironed out their daily opening hours and the place is generally well run so I'd say it's one local business worth supporting.

I came here with a group of ten friends after we had lunch and all wanted to eat some desserts (because there is always room for dessert!). Our group was seated promptly and without fuss which I appreciated. The girl next to me and I ordered the Earl Grey Lavender ice cream and Sea Salt Gula Melaka ice cream to share.We both thought the Earl Grey Lavender ice cream tasted absolutely divine. It had the lovely perfumed flavour of Earl Grey tea infused with the palate cleansing taste of lavender. This ice cream was served with two glazed almond biscuits, some jelly and fresh blueberries. The cornflakes at the bottom added a welcome level of crunchiness to the dessert. The Sea Salt Gula Melaka ice cream, served with mochi and sesame wafers, also tasted excellent and perfectly combined saltiness and a caramel-like sweetness to make a very delicious dessert.The prices at Sunday Folks are not exactly the cheapest at around 8 Singapore Dollars for one serving of ice cream, but boy oh boy are they worth it for the fabulous and rather unique ice creams flavours being served here :)

Sunday Folks is as charming as its name sounds. Love how it always feels like I am visiting a friend on this quaint part of holland village.Good to visit for a treat for yourself.Good for a girlfriends day out.Perfect for any kind of outings with everyone you love.A self-confessed gula melaka addict, I got to love their sea salt gula melaka soft serve. A cup of super goodness with all kinds of fancy toppings. On top of which you can still add on from a wonderful range of others.Salted caramel popcorn.Bitter orange.Chocolate mashmallow.Sesame brittle.Homemade granola.SoufflÃ© cheesecake.Looooove loooooooooove loooooooooove.My other soft spot would be the lemon lavender cake. As much as I have eaten this way too many times, it's still a twist of comfort for me
5
Been dying to come by since the beginning of time! Finally found the time to and had a great time catching up with my best friend! Staffs were friendly and courteous, ambience was terrific though it could get a lil busy and loud but all was good! Waffles and ice cream were the bomb

Went with my friend to celebrate my birthday.When you first reach there, you have to get a queue number and wait outside for a seat (if its crowded). They will call your number when they have a seat for you.I ordered an Earl Grey with Lavender ice-cream (S$7.90) and a Yuzu soda fizz drink (S$5.90). She ordered a Passionfruit Icecream waffle (S$9.90). My ice-cream and drink came about 20mins before her waffle came, I was trying to eat as slow as possible >.< My earl grey ice-cream came with a biscuit and blueberries at the top, cornflakes at the base (soggy since it was eaten last). Smooth and creamy! I would say though it is a little pricey, its delicious. My friend's waffle was SO GOOD! Definitely recommend anyone who goes there to get the waffle. My yuzu drink was a little bitter because of the fruit zest (skin) in the drink. Would definitely consider coming here again, with the parents. ( so they can pay ;) hahaha

We had the double waffle with a single scoop of dark chocolate ice cream. Everything was close to perfection -- photo worthy plate of ice cream with waffles, waffles were nicely done, topped with a swirly scoop of ice cream. The waiter was extremely friendly! As soon as we were seated, he taught us how we could order. I must say this place has got really good service! This cafe has a nice ambience too!Will visit again

Sunday Folks is best known for their signature swirly soft serve ice-cream topped on waffles.The place was already filled at 8pm, and the queues just keep on extending. The moment we stepped into the cafe, the gorgeous display of cakes and toppings behind the glass grabbed our attention. Eventually, we settled for Sea Salt Gula Melaka soft serve ice-cream topped on two square waffles ($11.80) and Banana Butterscotch Cake ($7.90). The cake was one of the better banana cakes that I've had. The sweetness of the butterscotch wasn't too overpowering and I could still taste the smooth, mellow and sweet flavour of the banana. The cookie crumble topping complemented the cake really well! :)The moment the gorgeous swirl of cold sweet goodness was served to our table, everyone whipped out their phones to snap pictures. The standard toppings were blueberries and strawberries. There were other toppings at the counter for you to choose from, at an additional price. Eating the ice-cream and waffles though, was a messy affair. We had to "sever" the pretty tower of ice-cream to prevent it from toppling over. Having been to both Creamier and Sunday Folks, I would say that I prefer Sunday Folks' rendition of the ice-cream waffles. Theirs was pleasantly sweet and not too creamy. The Gula Melaka soft serve tasted like brown sugar with a hint of butter. It reminded me of home and freshly baked cookies. :')It was the perfect combination with their crispy waffles.The night we went Sunday Folks, I was slowly turning into a human popsicle under the air-conditioning. The huge crowd would also mean that the buzz and chatter from tables all around us would tend to drown our own conversation. It isn't really a good place for a chat...I would be back again to try out their other ice-cream flavours, but perhaps at their off-peak hours, to escape from the crazy crowds

We made the trip out to Holland Village after a morning spent at the Botanical Gardens for a sit down and a cold treat.We ordered a waffle with the earl grey lavender ice cream (recommended by our waiter) and a cone with chocolate ice cream. The cone came with popcorn and marshmallow as well as cornflakes at the bottom of the cone and was heaven! The waffle was also really delicious and the earl grey lavender ice cream was refreshing and perfect for a super hot afternoon. I loved it and just wished that we'd visited earlier during our trip so we could come back a second time

Very affordable!!
Ordered the waffles with earl grey ice cream, and the tea time cake set!!
The banana cake was good!! However hot chocolate drink may be a little too milky!
Overall, will return again! :-)

I came to this restaurant for their waffles and ice cream one afternoon with the family. We ordered the double waffle with sea salt gula Melaka soft serve ice cream.When the ice cream was served, I was taking photos. I started to notice the ice cream was not piped properly and it was tilting to one side. Within seconds, it tipped over with part of the ice cream on the table. I went to the counter and told the staff about it. Without hesitation, they said they will make a fresh one for me. This was excellent customer service.When the new dessert came, we promptly ate it. Its good!A great dining experience with great customer experience to boot!Recommended

This place has by far, the best soft serve ice cream I've ever had! Several friends recommended this place and I kept seeing pictures on social media (Instagram), so I finally decided to try it out back in August 2015. I went with my aunt on a Sunday afternoon and even though we had to take a queue number, we only waited around 10 minutes before getting a table. I ordered the 'Earl Grey Lavender' while my aunt had the 'Roasted Pistachio', and we both had them in a cone. Earl grey and lavender are two very distinct flavours, which I didn't think would come through when put together but I was mistaken! You can clearly taste both flavours in every lick of this soft serve. At first, you get the earl grey and the after-taste is of the lavender. The mix of the two flavours is light and sweet. Heavenly! It was paired nicely with lavender konnyaku jelly, fresh blueberries and almond brittle. The roasted pistachio was equally fragrant! You could really taste the roasted-ness of the pistachios. This flavour was paired with a sugar cookie stick and crushed roasted pistachios on the top. Definitely a must if you are a pistachio lover! A solid 5/5 stars, I will most definitely be coming back again to try out some other flavours! The cakes in the display looked really, really good

I tried the waffle with vanilla ice cream and berries coulis and also a mug of hot cocoa.And it was to die for! Really delicious waffle and ice cream. Would definitely go again.The place is crowded all the time so factor that in. The queuing system is quite efficient though.

Sunday Folks specializes in soft serve ice cream & waffles. They have cakes & coffee/tea also. I visited at the tail end of a weekday lunch & it was way too nosy. Not a good idea if you're planning on having any kind of conversation. Business must be good as they are constantly busy on the times I walked by. It is the sort of cafe twenty something flock to & looks like something from the pages of Kinfolk. I had a slice of the lemon lavender cake. It came warmed up which was a nice idea but reeked of a lavender odour that you find in commercial cleaning products. The Madagascan vanilla ice cream was nicely presented with oat crumble, cubes of chocolate & a piece of dried pineapple. It just tasted sweet with none of the vanilla flavor. Pleasant enough but not memorable. Summer ice tea was best of the lot, pretty & came unsweetened the way ice tea should. Didn't have a waffle as there was a 30 minute wait. Insane.Wait crew was young & nice. Lovely soundtrack but was wasted as the decibel levels were absurd

Heard about this place and decided to come try their desserts.They are related to Creamier ice cream at Toa Payoh.I ordered the Waffles with Earl Grey soft serve ice cream. The waffles are made to order and it took about 10 minutes for them to arrive. Waffles are crispy and nice. The ice cream is done differently from Creamier, where its soft serve. Loved the taste of the ice cream. Its good
5
Most waffles places serve good waffles or good ice cream, but never both... Sunday Folks is one of the few places which manages to meet my expectations for both... I LOVE the sea salt gula melaka (palm sugar)... it's one of the best around, though if I would nitpick, I just like it a tad less sweet. The waffles are crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside and holds up well against the soft serve. The presentation is also well thought out with the soft serve served on top of a waffle biscuit, so the waffle below doesn't gets soggy. The pistachio soft serve is equally good as well, and the dark chocolate is very concentrated in a good way. Would definitely recommend to friends. There's always a queue whenever I come here, but the queue moves pretty quickly and is very efficiently managed. Great service from all the staff here as well, especially the female manager. I came here 3 times in a space of 2 weeks, that's how much i love this place

For the past year, I have been hunting throughout the entire island for the best waffles in Singapore. While I cannot claim that I have tried every single waffle there is, I can say that I have tried most of the famous ones that are making their rounds in SNS. And the conclusion is that Sunday Folks, or their sister cafe, Creamier, offers the best waffles to be found locally. It's not the overly fluffy kind found in Strangers' Reunion or Gelare, nor is it the overly crispy kind that makes you feel as if you are eating a strange mix of biscuit/waffle thing, but crispy on the exterior with a hint of the dough in the middle. I am doing a bad job of describing, but it's the best really.Also, I prefer Sunday Folks over Creamier because this place offers soft-serve rather than ice cream, which I enjoy more. Some people like their quirky flavours such as Earl Grey Lavender, but I prefer Strawberry. Do note that the chocolate flavour here melts super fast and is hardly the best chocolate soft-serve to be found on the island (a huge disappointment to me because I love chocolate ice cream; having to default to strawberry dismays me). If you want good chocolate soft-serve, looks elsewhere (e.g. Godiva).Oh yes, the price. If I remember correctly, it's 9.80 for one square waffle and one soft-serve. That may not be the exact price, but it should be around there. It also has a gimmicky charcoal cone too

Visited this place with a friend on a random weekday in the afternoon and was surprised to find a queue. The waiting system was techy and surprisingly well managed. So it wasn't a fuss at all. Not sure how it would be on a weekend. Famed for its waffles and ice cream, it doesn't fail to impress although a little pricey. Portion of one is good for sharing with two. Would pay a second visit but only if I have friends visiting from elsewhere. Because it has a lovely atmosphere with good dessert. Why not
4
Firstly, be prepared to see a queue outside as the place is pretty small. Their queue system is electronic and efficient though and I was impressed by their prompt service on this. I had waffle and Pistachio ice cream and boy was it awesome! Super tasty combi, only that it's pricey. Expect to spend around at least $10. Service was good and prompt as well and the ambience is nice though a little too noisy to have a quiet chat. Complimentary water provided self-service. Overall enjoyable experience
