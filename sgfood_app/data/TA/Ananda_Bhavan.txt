While we searching for a vegetarian place to eat in Little India, Ananda Bhavan came up repeatedly on various websites amongst the top. Well we were not disappointed. Good food and a bustling place.
4
Even though the dinning hall does not look very clean, food is very good and tasty. Best place for cheap and good South Indian vegetarian food.
4
I had food on many occasions. I think it is open for 24 hours. Vegetarian restaurant, mainly south Indian also serving roti , aloo paratha etc.
4
Walked in here, doesn’t pretend to be anything fancy as this Indian eatery just serve great southern food.
2
Typical take a number type of restaurant with a rude blighter at the counter. Messy and noisy to say the least and your order comes piecemeal as and when the cook gets a bigger batch.
Avoidable place.
3
Ananda Bhave Nishad 24 hours open restaurant in Singapore.
It has many vegetarian items.
Good food but average taste. Best for snack items rather than lunch or dinner.
It is pure vegetarian restaurant
4
Food yummy and good but price a bit too expensive with no service.
Restaurant with air conditioning, crowded and noisy.
Near by Mustafa shopping.
5
Ananda Bhavan is across Mustafa. And both of them are open for 24 hours!
Excellent South Indian veg food. Hat tip: Bathura and Rasam idli
5
We arrived in Singapore very late at night before Christmas and while chatting to the concierge asked where we could have tea - teh tarik and breakfast the next day. He said go where the locals go - Little India! The next day we walked to the Mustafa Centre in Little India where we planned to shop after breakfast as the centre has great bargains in perfume, clothing and spices. We were directed to the Ananda Bhavan Vegetarian restaurant and it was busy with families eating interesting breakfasts on large banana leaves. Not sure what to order I asked the cashier what was the most popular dish - Number 3 - and it was so delicious we were in food heaven. I highly recommend trying breakfast here.
4
Ananda Bhavan is located opposite to Mustufa Market. If you are craving for Indian food, you can visit here. We had ordered noodles, veg fried rice, masala dosa and rava masala dosa. Out of these, only the south Indian items were good. We had the same experience for other times on the next day.Service is fast. You need to pay first and take the coupon, then they will serve at your table. Overall a good restaurant
4
This ananda Bhavan is little big and well laid out restaurant bang opposite Mustafas
The dosas are quite large and are made before eyes and served very hot. The tomato chutney is yummy
4
Ananda Bhavan is a Vegetarian restaurant serving South Indian food. It is located near Little India. One can try mysore dosa and variety of dosas.
5
The best vegetarian south and north indian food. Very old since 1924. Opposite Mustafa centre. Quick delivery of ordered food. Very very nice restaurant in singapore for veg lovers.
4
We ordered aloo parantha which is served with daal, vege, curd etc and was very yummy. We noticed that they provide more quantity of daal, vege, curd in takeaway order than dine in.
5
Very good South Indian food esp best for breakfast. Serves fast and have unique number system. They do serve North Indian food but I did not try it
5
This is very good outlet working since 1924. They serve all types of Indian vegetarian food. Dosa, North Indian food, Paobhaji were excellent.
Must eat here on your trip.
2
It located opposite to Mustafa centre entrance 2. I expected more South Indian traditional taste because of they are in the same business around 100 years. But I’m disappointed.
5
A Self Service Restaurant with limited place, but frequented by diverse culture of people. Can't Miss Onion Dosa, Idiyappam (limited availability) or Kurma combination. Ask for Thick Coconut Chutney and also try Ghee Rawa Dosa
5
I usually eat here everytime I visit Little India. Their prices are a bit higher than other locations but I love their food and the meals are huge! Selfservice, or rather order at the counter and they will bring it to you. Very good!
3
You need to order first at the cash counter by seeing the menu then pay for it and take a number flag and sit on one of the available table and wait for your order to arrive. Its quite a strange way to take orders but anyway we found the waiter (local Chinese guy) to be not at all interested in serving the food, we asked for extra chutney and he asked us to go to the kitchen area and collect it from there. one of the item was missed by the kitchen staff, we had to go there personally to remind them about the same and then we got it after another 10 minutes. Its pathetic and last but not the least, quite expensive as compared to Komala Vilas located 10 minutes away.
3
The Food served here is good but it is surely overpriced..But it has an advantage of being open 24X7 so one can have a meal whenever he/she wants and its a vegetarian Indian Restaurant Just opposite Mustafa Centre
5
Great Food, Reasonable Prices, Quick Service. After a hectic tour of SGP what an Indian Want is his food ! and for Pure Vegetarians like us, its a blessing. Staff was also very cooperative. I will always recommend it to all.
4
Good Indian good. Reasonable price. We went there about 5 times during our stay. Always crowded.
Best Is it's open 24/7.
4
Lil bit of waiting time, as they have large space,lil bit costly according to singapore.
Taste is good if you are missing your country food outside.must try once.
5
-Place is comfortable, air-conditioned & clean-They make the best paper thosai in our opinion! -Kids favorite is the paper thosai...thin, crispy thosai (eaten with sugar) -I love the paper thosai, comes with the sides (sorry I don't know what they are called) and the Dahl. -My husband's favorite is their Masala thosai (plain thosai wrapped with potatoes & spices). -If you like sweet-milky-spiced tea, the Masala Tea is really good, much better than Starbucks' chai latte :) -If you like cold drinks. The mango lassi is nice, but my kids find it a bit sour, not sweet enough for their taste. They prefer the ice-milo (chocolate malt drink). -Good service, reasonable price
4
Counter order approach to service with fast turn around of orders. Set meals are generously portioned with a nice range of flavours. We mostly order set Thalia meals and was very nice. It even included a small sweet offering. Tables were clean and floors clean also. The drinking water supplied by self service. My set meal North Indian Set Thalia was $11. Clean toilets.
3
has changed in taste a lot . It was great during my earlier visits . This time around it was not so great . maybe changes iam not sure . was not happy with even the dosas this time . service also leaves a lot to be dessire
4
AB have good verity of food for Breakfast, Lunch and dinner. As usual i visited it again and this time only with my 2years daughter cos she like to eat Puri with mash potato and i ordered Vada set and it was fresh nice and crispy i really loved them. Service at AB is very good and Nice and clean seating no bad odor in eating area and aircon is best just right to keep you going
4
Was recommended this because it operates virtually round the clock. I needed to have breakfast by 7 am for a early meeting, so had breakfast here on 2 occasions. Had Idli/dosa and Pongal on separate days and the quality of food served is very good. The service is on the table, and they work on prepaid basis, where you pay and get a token, which had to be placed in the table for them to serve you. Coffee served is nice as well
4
This vegetarian restaurant is opposite Mustafa centre in little India and is also open 24 hours , the place is very popular and bustling with crowd in rush hours throughout the day, food is simple yet fulfilling and taste is authentic South Indian . Lots of varieties and option in menu plus food is reasonably priced. It feels great to taste Authentic South Indian food and Indian ambience in Singapore . Very quick service and food is served hot. Good work . Food is the king here which is tasty and stupendous don't expect candle like dinner atmosphere . But the quality and popularity of the restaurant can be judged by the fact that it has been here for so many decades and still is it mostly crowded and also open 24 hours. Good work keep it up ...//
2
During peak hours this self service restaurant has long queues but insufficient seating area.
The chairs are low too inconvenience to elders or those with knee problems.
Food is fairly good but better restaurants are around the corner.
Try once..
4
Good South Indian dishes available.. Good Service... well maintained and clean.. nice preparation...
4
Great restaurant for a quick indian meal !
Dosa, Masala Dosa, Puri, everything is good !
Do not hesitate if you enjoy south indian food !
4
Good mini meals. The only trouble in this place is getting a table as everything is self-service. Its quite crowded at meal times.
4
Location is very good, just opp. Mustafa Centre. It serves delicious food and at a reasonable price.
3
We had lunch in our package. Food was ordinary. Not hot. Could not serve big group. Price @ 800/- per person is too costly in Singapore for single meal.
5
Great south indian food, lots of options of south indian breakfast lunch and dinner options. Can feel the real taste of India
3
Right opp Mustafa shopping center. Food tastes good but is overpriced compared to even Sarvana Bhavan. Place can do with better cleanliness.
3
I bought a take away paper Dosa with masala on the side. I've avoided this Resturant after they added a 10% service charge on the already pricey menu. You still have to order at the counter and get your own drink. They just serve you when the food is ready. Food wise, it's OK and very generous with the Chetnuies
5
I have ordered Masala dosa with onions, uludu wadaa, and a cuppa. The Paper Masala dosa was 1.5feet long(after roll off) with inside potatoe curry. Very delicious and very warm-hot hot. with sambaar and parippu curry and two diffrent types of coconut chutney. No taste on the white coconut chutney but Red coconut chutney was very good and tasty. I went there in the morning for the first time and that time there were only 3 couples were having morning breakfast. When I went for lunch, the restaurant was like sardin packed. I had to wait inside standing till vacant table is empty. Highly recommended vegetarian restaurant. Just opposite Mohamed Mustafa shopping complex
4
The food here is good and the service is nice. We had a nice South Indian breakfast at the place and the Dosa was very good.
4
superb indian food...reasonably prices and very efficient staff...good value for money. dosas are a must try here.
5
Nice hotel near little india and we enjoyed the dosa .Service was good .The price was ok when you compare to other hotels near by ...good for a quick meal with basic ambience...The restaurant is clean .
5
this veg. restaurant is very clean.food are tasty and delicious.big group of people can accomodate easily. staff and service is very good.
4
We had lunch and breakfast the break fast was nice and as sufficient quantity where as the lunch was average in taste
3
Decent taste and value for money ... With good varieties ... Sometimes taste not consistent .. good for a quick meal with basic ambience.. service can be better ..
3
South Indian breakfast items were tasty. Ordered coffee and the waiter brought the coffee with some of it spilled over. I guess one needs to speak in tamil for a courteous reply there. Overall, good for a quick breakfast.
3
They offers all kinds of vegetarian food.
One advantage is it is 24 hours open restaurant.
Service is good.
South Indian food is good. But North indian food is average taste.
Value for money since cost is not that high.
4
Very good resturant , all varaities of indian vegitarain food are available there ( North Indian, South Indian ) at any time.Clean and neat . The resturant set up like a food court. All the food are very tasty and in the right location.
2
I tried south indian thali here (as it's a south indian restaurant), and found it way too spicy compared to other authentic south indian restaurants. The price was about $10.5, which is much more than what a comparable restaurant with such an ambience would cost in a place like thi
4
Very good restaurant in Little India.
Good option to have South Indian Food.
Good Experience in the trip.
2
In my short stay in Singapore, i visited Ananda Bhavan quite frequently. Its good for South Indian food throughout the day. The prices are standard and the meal combos are quite pocket friendly. They offer quick service and clean, free drinking water.
5
Very good restaurant . Near Mustafa shopping centre . They have South Indian and North Indian . Thali was also available . Prices were reasanable . Very croweded when we went for an Thursday night dinner
3
I ate a south Indian meal for my dinner and was happy with the service and taste of the food. I would recommend my viewers looking for proper south Indian food, to visit this restaurant.
1
The cashier/manager came up to our group and banged the table shouting to be quiet. Even if the group was making noise, there is a polite way of conveying that. Very rude!
4
A very good, efficient service, tasty Indian food, North Indian or South Indian variety, reasonable price, clean and hygienic preparations.
5
I dined here on numerous occasions. Healthy and tasty vegetarian restaurant for all ages of people. Price is affordable as well.
3
We expected it to match the quality this chain has in India, but we were grossly disappointed. I hope the management does an internal check for the reasons.
4
We've frequented this hotel, located just opp Mustafa Center on Syed Alwi road. Good place to relax and take a break after shopping. Quality of food is very good. They have a wide choice of South Indian tiffin items as well as Chats etc. Meals are also available with a sumptuous spread of items. Rotis are well made and very tasty. Authentic filter coffee is available. The only point is that the seating is a bit too hard - chairs and tables are fixed to the ground, and sometimes can become uncomfortable for large individuals...! Otherwise - no complaints - they are doing a great job. Staff are well trained, courteous, clean and helpful. Kitchenware is neat...who needs more ??
5
Stopped by with a friend and had a great, delicious and plenty meal. The food comes fast and the taste does not disappoint. There is a nice selection of your usual singaporean indian food. Vegetarian which is great. The prices are good as well. Totally worth it
4
Went with friends for dinner..
Good for non veg lovers particularly chicken items.
Value for money
near musthafa mall in little india
good service
4
you may enjoy veg south Indian dishes varieties of food allowed you may enjoy Indian thali.also njoy limboo pani
5
Nice food with many varieties. Fast and good service. Tried several dishes and all were good with reasonable cost.
3
It is a nice experience to have genuine taste South Indian food at the heart of Singpore. The dosas are very delicious.
4
Went on Sunday for dinner.
Food was authentic south Indian but not so great ambience. More of a fast food place. Can be tried for vegetarian south Indian food
3
Ananda Bhavan is very affordable and the staff is not very friendly. It serves Indian food and has different counters for food and beverages. It is air conditioned and affordable.
5
We were staying close to Ananda Bhavan and found it convenient for breakfast before leaving for the day. The place is open 24/7 and serves vegetarian south indian food. Ofcourse there are chat and other indian dishes too; but south indian is the best. We always got to eat fresh food; despite the time we visited. Reasonably priced too
5
I was introduced to this fine Indian vegetarian restaurant by a colleague and could quite happily eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here. Place your order, take a number and wait for the great food to arrive. The lassi is also very good (to my taste anyway). Rawa dosa much recommended
4
Ananda Bhavan is situated near Mustafa Centre in Singapore which is a landmark in Little India. The restaurant offers many options of Indian dishes such as Pani Puri, Dosa, Chole Bhature, Sweets etc. The taste of its food items is good and you wont feel as if you away from India
4
This was the first place we visited on arrival at our hotel nearby. We had lunch here - the place was crowded and we had to wait a bit for tables to get free. The variety of food was less than I had expected, but covered decent south indian traditional as well as north indian roti/subzi fares. The food is tasty. We also came here for breakfast another day and loved the various "sets" (combos) they had - tasty south indian stuff. completely recommend eating her
4
This is very good, the choices for the prices are very affordable and the quality is one of the best.
Crowded yet always good on service as well.
5
All food was great, delicious, not pricy, service is excellent. visited 3 times in my visit to singapore, highly recommend it.
4
Although slightly priced, but worth trying at least one time. You can enjoy any kind of vegetarian food here within your budget. Kids loved the "save puri" and the jaleebi's.
4
Offers choice south Indian menu dosas, vada, thali meal and sweets. Also has a good north Indian thali,,
4
In a row of restaurants opposite Mustafa centre, this occupies prominent place. The meals at 7.5 Singapore dollars is a steal. Even the mini meals was good.
Food is tasty and service is good.
1
All the items are average and prices are high if you sum up ambience and cleanliness, better restaurant are there with same price and good service
4
After a tiring 4 hours of shopping in Mustafa, we went there to grab something to eat & drink quickly. Milo drink was awesome.
2
If you are tired of walking around, then you can go in to this restraurant and rest for awhile in Aircon. Simply because the order takes more than 20 minutes to be delivered. Its self service, you must pay at the counter first and then either self collect or get it delivered to your table. Average quality of food
5
This place is very good for dining with friends or family. I had a wonderful meals late in the night. I decided to share the experience of late dining or for person who wants food at late night.. yes this place is good. you get full menu available 24 hours.
4
I am more of a regular to this restaurant whenever i go grocery shopping to Mustafa.Always had good experience. Not a place to hang around with friends or family , but more like a place to go to when you are hungry and looking out for something proper to eat
5
All 4 of us. 2 Vegetarians & 2 Non-Veg. really enjoyed the vast selection of different varieties of vegetarian cuisine. Also the Masala Chai Tea, very refreshing after a hard days shopping.
4
Looks clean . All Indian , north and south are available. Only vegetarian but no service by waiters, SELF SERVICE. Food is served in clean environment, AIr conditioning is a must, in Singpore and good.
5
best food i have ever had, one should must visit and had food here,
like good dosai,lime juice and mango shake
2
very commercial, north indian tastes like south indian. Actually no taste in food. would not visit again
5
I felt i was in India. The food is delicious. I had ice cream kulfi, massala tea. The tawa chappathi set is very good !!
3
This restaurant is located in from of Mustafa Center of Little India. They serve pure vegetarian Indian food, but popular for south Indian dishes like Dosai, Uttappam, Vada-Sambar, Idli, etc. Some North Indian items are also on the menu. Evenings are very crowded and you may have to struggle to find a table. While they do not take prior reservation, after placing food order at counter, they give a token which you need to place on table in a way that server can see the number on token to serve your order on the table
3
The location is good as its opposite Mustafa Centre. There is seating area upstairs and downstairs and the aircon is fairly effective. The cleanliness of the place is average. One has to stand in queue to order and prices are reasonable. The cashier gives a stand with a number which has to be displayed while waiting at the table. Would recommend the South Indian cuisine as the other Indian preperation such as Pav Bhaji is disappointing. The place is usually packed owing to the variety on offer
3
Ananda Bhavan is located right opposite the 24X7 Mustafa Center in Singapore and specializes in the South Indian vegetarian food it serves, although it also serves North Indian vegetarian dishes. It is relatively expensive compared to neighboring joints and the quality of food too needs some improvement as it is not what it used to be. Service timing is quite decent, but the food was slightly on the oilier side
1
I had the most terrible experience... I paid Sg$10 for one masala dosa, one plain dosa and a bottle of water.. It took 20 min and they did not serve the dosa to me.. I went and complained to the cashier and he did not even have the courtesy to say sorry. I decided to leave the restaurant without consuming the food.. Please do not go to this restaurant. the cleanliness is so bad, chairs are dirty..the service is terrible.
4
Typical food place known for its south Indian cuisine @ reasonable prices if you do not care for ambience & environment and are prepared to wait for the table. Also serves other Indian cuisine but not very popular though. Food quality and taste is reasonable and is okay occasionally. Great advantage of location as it is road across popular Mustafa Mall and is also 24 x 7 functional
5
Authentic South Indian food, good service. Ordered thali and dosa and both were tasty coupled with prompt service
3
Its ok ok.. you have to pay first then they give food.. Taste is also ok.. Mostly they Provide thali
2
Ananda Bhavan used to be a very good place to eat Indian food. It was a favorite place of mine until recently. The quality and the ingredients seems to have diminished whereas the price has rocketed. I don't mind paying high price for good food if it is worth it.I ordered the most basic south Indian set lunch, and the side-dishes were so pathetic. It was soy nuggets (soya chunks - a defatted protein byproduct of soybean oil manufacturing) and paneer (cottage cheese) - both not south Indian if you ever ate authentic south Indian food before. The vegetable side dishes seems to have disappeared totally! I gave them many chances as I thought may be the menu on that day was bad. Time and time again I was disappointed with the soy nuggets and paneer in different forms. Sorry to say I am way too disappointed to give it another chance.They are surviving because of the brand name that was established in the past with the good food that they used to dish out. But sadly it has gone south and there are better Indian food options in the vicinity with lesser price. I who used to frequent Ananda Bhavan for South Indian food for more than 5 years am now sadly looking elsewhere for authentic south Indian food. Please do something to bring the good food and the old quality back
3
I give this place an average rating as compared to the other South Indian places around its average. Medu wada's are not hot and other items are ok. Best part about this place is that its open 24 hrs to cater to the Mustafa just across, which is also open 24 hrs dail
1
The food is not tasty and the chapati was not fried properly. There was not enough space in the eating table. All incoming people who came dashed the chairs. The one star above is given for your Service. We kindly request for you to take care of the above problem
5
Located right opposite to the mustafa shopping entrance, which is open for 24 Hrs, So once you are hungry when you go for midnight shopping to mustafa, just come out and enjoy the wide range of south indian food. Mid range value for the food in terms of pricing
2
we live in Little India and have tried almost all restaurants as we are spoilt for choice in Lil India. Ananda Bhavan is a popular place to eat at and used to be known for their quality and good serving portion as well. over the years, we have noticed that the portion is getting smaller (if you cater even), the dosa is smaller than the ones we get in other restaurants, and to my shock today I has Bhel Puri which has just sev,puffed rice and LOTs of onions and the gravies ofcourse...WHY is Ananda Bhavan doing this while their charges are exhorbitant? you pay $5/.90 for bhel which has nothing but onions in it...first time in my life I have eaten such an economic Bhel Puri at a 5 Star price....ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE FOR MONEY
4
Visited with family in first week of May. Had masala dosa and North Indian thali. Food was good and met expectation. Dosas for approx 4 SGD and NI and SI thalis for approx 9 SGDs. Standard rate across most veg restaurants. Opp Mustafa center. Next doors is Kailash Parbat and couple of blocks away is Saravanan Bhavan
2
Hello,I visited this Vegetarian restaurant last week for dinner and didn't like the food. I ordered a south indian thali and my friend ordered a north indian thali... curry and rice in both the thali were not good... even the roti or chapati were not tasty... i wouldn't recommend this place... price was reasonable, approx 10.5 SGD for each thal
4
The thaali was quite wholesome ( excluding the vegetables that were not so well processed). The quantity was quite filling with traditional sides that are well thoughtfully provided. In a foreign land it was so relieving to see the tamil culture food being provided with no reservation. The hygiene and the quality stood not compromised
4
This chain of restaurants , delivers what it promises, never disappointed. Good meals at reasonable prices. Wished it's Airport T2 outlet was still operating
5
anytime during the day or night you get variety of food, tastes good and value for money, a worth visiting restaurant test your tongue once.
4
Very good South Indian food, tasty and also very reasonably priced as well. We ordered idly, dosa, onion uthappam & vada. All the items were good.
5
This place is very gud for vegetarians, the meals are fresh, hygienic, they also offer Jain thali's and Jain meals.
5
After Singapore, I live in India for 4 years yet never met the same tasty Paranthas as served at Ananda Bhavan, opposite Mustafa Shopping Centre. Filled w Cheese, with chhole and some other sauces, yummiestthing in South East Asia!! Highly recommended.
2
Ananda Bhavan's claim to fame, from our experience and understanding is, its location - opposite Mustafa. Desperate Indian tourists, on the lookout for some Indian veg food, get in with the hope of having authentic food. And non Indians probably have never tasted authentic food. And Ananda Bhavan survives. If you are lucky you get a decent dosa, if not, the batter is either too fermented, or low on salt and thus insipid, or just too thick to call it dosa; the sambar is a joke, most of the times. Lesser said the better about their North Indian fare, especially their chaats. We ordered papdi chaat and it was a disaster. There were unpeeled huge hot potatoes (freshly boiled). The sweet-sour chutney was.... well neither sweet and way too sour. Lets not get into the coriander chutney. All in all, the few times we have been here, it has been a HUGE disappointment. Maybe if the management reduce the number of dishes they offer and concentrate on serving few but authentic decent Indian food, it might help. If you are willing to walk a bit further and away, there are plenty other Indian joints.We have never found 'Ananda' (bliss) at this Bhavan (building or space
4
Ananda Bhavan, the name inspired us to enter as we were eagerly looking for a good Veggie restaurant at Singapore. Ananda Bhavan is located at Little India and very close to Mustafa Complex. It was around 1.00 pm when we entered this restaurant. The ambiance of the Restaurant is good. We ordered South Indian Thalis, One North Indian thali, Two Dosas and one Chole Bhaturey. We were given a number stand to display on our table. Within minutes, our food was served. The quality of the food is good. The standard of quality is maintained.Ananda Bhavan is one of the oldest Restaurants located in Singapore. We were told that it was established in the year 1924. Its great that they are running the restaurant for the past 92 years and they have, in all 4 branches at Singapore.Apart from South Indian and North Indian, Chinese, Malay and Jain food are also available. The rates are very reasonable. The service is good. We loved the food and we felt that we are in our Home
3
Came here today for dosas with the family. Unfortunately the quality could be better. Fairly efficient service though. We had 4 dosas and a mango lassi for my daughter with 1 masala tea for a cost of $30. I prefer the Madras New Woodlands outlet in Upper Dickson rd
4
all we friends came down here to have some Indian chilly spicy taste. We got Dosa and Choley Bhturey. and it was awesome. Was feeling like seating in one of the resto in Chennai. Was very familiar and food was so tasty. Should try for Indian Food. Enjoy Lovers
4
We visited Ananda Bhavan after our shopping at around 10pm. As usual the service was good the food is great, the hot beverages are good. For Indian vegetarian food we will highly recommend Anada Bhavan. You can never go wrong here or at any of its branches
3
I noticed leftovers on tabled as the service is slow, mostly 70-75% left food. Probably they did not liked. Owners should spend more time. No taste of indian food. Took 30 minutes to service with 5 customers in waiting.
4
Had the lunch South Indian thali it was very tasty and packed with full flavours. The place is really buzzing lots of people.
4
Self service from counter
Food quality is good
Open 24x7
Large variety of food is available and rates are also quite reasonable
Suggest everyone should try here
4
Right opposite to Mustapha Center. For any shoppers after doing shopping at mustapha center, its right place to take a break. Food is good and reasonable price.
3
Visited this place around 1 am and it was still buzzing. Average food; there are better South Indian food outlets nearby but the 24 Hr convenience cannot be negated. Good to have around!
4
Right infront of Mustafa centre. Serves reasonably good South Indian cuisine which is great for the traveller who amidst long shopping around Mustafa wants a quick bite. Clean, hygenic and pretty friendly staff. Opens early in the morning and till late evening.
1
We searched this place on google maps and were happy to know that there is a 24 hours vegetarian restaurant near Mustafa Center. We went there with a lot of hopes; but we were totally demoralized when the food arrived. We ordered one tandoori set (two tandoori roties + two small portions of vegetables) and one Onion Rava Masala Dosa. Both the items were very badly cooked, the roties were slightly sour in taste, and the quantity of the two vegetables were too less. The dosa was soggy, thick and soft, despite instructions to make it crispy. A big disappointment indeed ! We went to Saravana Bhavan located nearby and had a meal there
1
had rava thosai, puri and roti prata, ....on of the worst food i had in my life, rava thosai hard and not crispy, with bad oil smell. puri damn small and maybe 3 sets also not enough.i tries the black bombay halwah , that was also to no standard.. last but not least, the the cost of the items ordered is not resonable though....no wonder not many people are eating here. will never step here again.its best to close down
4
After our shopping expedition in the area, my wife and I decided on a late lunch at this bustling restaurant. We observed that the majority of the patrons were Indians. We ordered two idlys and a rava dosai. They came served with chutneys, and sambar. The idlys were spongy with the right tinge of sourness. The rava dosai was spicy with chopped green chilies in it. We enjoyed our quick lunch and left very satisfied indeed
2
We decided to go to Anand Bhavan for Lunch and ordered a South Indian Thali. The food in the Thali was all messed up. The tables and chairs were not cleaned properly. The hand wash area was total mess with water all around and dustbin was overflowing. The food taste and quality was below average and the hygiene in the open kitchen was questionable. Their are better restaurants around, avoid this restauran
3
This is one of the vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. Rates are reasonable. Service is ok. Their medhu vada is not good.
3
This is another fast food restaurant . You get everything you want at a very reasonable rate . It is just in front of the mustafer center gate no 3 .
5
Great Vegetarian food, located at multiple locations, very fast service, reasonable price, value for money
5
Ananda Bhavan is a best and cheap place to eat south indian food in Singapore. Its in Serangoon Road as well as on Syeed Alwi Road i.e. opposite of Mustafa Center.
4
great vegetarian choices and tasty food next to the busy mustafa centre and south indian temples in little india area
the thali is a must on a day you craving for too much. dosas and parathas are for a lighter meal but all equally tasty
3
Pure Vegetarian food with decent taste. The ambiance is clean. I had dosa and the service was ok.. The restaurant is open 24 x 7.

This is a self service restaurant which serves good authentic South Indian food along with few other options.This is open early morning from 7:00 am onwards and that is the best part as it is easy if you are a business traveller and want to try something different on one of the days.Good tasty food.
3
It has brances in various locations and the taste also varies between locations. The best location to have good food is at the Changi Airport T2 or Syeed Alwi Road. Some dishes are good and some dishes are just average. South Indian Meals is just average.What I like here is Appam, Pongal, Upma
2
Although the food is tasty, it certainly affects your tummy as some of the stuff served such as chutney etc. may not be freshly made. One of the Asian staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Knife is not a part of the cutlery here! You will get only spoon and fork. It is crowded and noisy. The seats are so uncomfortable. Will not visit again as we do not want to fall sick

If you ask any Singapore based Indian, I believe they will be aware of this restaurant. Even if you ask an Indian foreigner, they will surely know Ananda Bhavan as a brand, specially in south Indian region.Located bang opposite to Mustafa Center, therefore commands a good reputation. However, there are so many other options as well on the same road and nearby vicinity so Ananda Bhavan is not the only option here.Survives on its brand image, otherwise i did not find anything special here. You have to place your order on the counter, they will give you a number flag and the server will get your order to your table when ready. They do not take much time to prepare your order as it is a fast moving restaurant and preparations are made upfront. The prices mentioned above the order counter exclude GST and service charge (10% in their case). I ordered a north Indian thali, the quantity was ok but the food quality is just average. The sweet was pathetic, curries and breads were ok. Price wise, it was less costly than other restaurants but then they also let you down on the quality. I am not sure of south Indian dishes would be better here, as I did not order one so couldn't comment. My recommendation would be to try this outlet if you do not have any other better option or if you have someone who is die hard vegetarian and does not like eating at a joint which servers mixed food

Pure Vegetarian food . we can get taste will be moderate. nothing much to say !. Near Mustafa Centre is an advantage
4
We had been to this restaurant for food on Wednesday . Restaurant is neat and clean. We had dosa. It was good with resonable price with indian taste.
5
Great dishes, south Indian, North Indian, jain meals, etc., Great taste, Generous serving, disciplined staff, clean environment in spite of crowd.
Memorable food .One has to experience, words cannot describe the grand satisfying food, even difficult to get in India in many cities, reasonable price!
3
We happen to go to Little India for dinner and we are almost always late. As usual, most of the restaurants close between 10-11 PM. Hence Anand Bhavan. It is a kind of place one we go to have food when we are really hungry and we don't have a lot of vegetarian options around. The food is OK as long as it is south indian. I am not a fan of north indian food here. But yes, we ordered buttermilk which was very nice
4
The place is clean and pleasant.The food is really good. We have visited this place several times and tried a variety of South Indian snacks - Idli, Vada, Dosa, Utthappa................. The mini-meal however was a bit disappointing. The filter coffee is amongst the best that I have had! Everyone who drinks coffee should try it 
2
Went this morning to pick up some Idlis. The place was empty and yet the guy behind the food counter insisted on slowly cleaning up the place, making a dosa - and while the Dosa was getting cooked, not bothering to pack up the Idlis which were right there in front of him Another customer behind me just got fed up with his attitude and went back to the cash counter and got a refundVisited Monday June 1 2015 at 9 a
4
If you are thinking what to eat that would last you throughout the day, think not further than order the Briyani lunch set over the counter.The serving is big enough for two and even heavy eater find it a challenge to finish the set that is served with desert
2
I've been a few times but can say the food is very mediocre. She me better than other visits. Generally not very consistent.After my last visit, I very much doubt I'll be back as I ordered Parata dish similar to a Kotthu Parata. The Parata was very stale and hard. On the upside, it's reasonably priced and the service isn't bad...There are however much better places in Lil India
5
Since I travelled with my family consisting of my parents who are strict vegetarians, this restaurant was a blessing for us. My father almost had Breakfast and dinner every day of our trip of 6 days. The food was very hyegenic, affordable and tasty. Better than the famous Saravana Bhavan
4
This outlet is one of many in Spore. They simply do not disappoint in terms of cleanliness, presentation and taste. What ever you order here will exceed the expectation. The only negative thing about this chain of restaurant; the $ they command does not correlate with the service they provide. Their business module is 98.00% fast food franchise. Other than, this group of restaurant are damn good. Cheer
4
Great Indian Vegetarian fast food but pricey. Opposite Mustafa's 24 hour Shopping Centre. The service is ok but the premises is clean. Free flow of drinking water. The only thing you need to help yourself to the water.
5
We had breakfast combo here. Really good option if you want to try differnet dishes. Taste was good for the rate. If you are visiting Mustafa, its just opposite.
4
First time I came to Singapore and went to this restaurant and it was amazing.the food was so delicious and so much tasty.
4
If you are looking for vegetarian or South Indian food then this place will be right place for that. We tried Dosa and lassi over there and taste was good. Being an Indian we feel proud when we get Indian food and restaurant in abroad.
3
Good system for ordering of Food
However Rava Dosa ordered was oily.Chutney was ok but sambhar didn't taste that good
Also Dahi puri was not so good
Better stick to Thali options.
Slightly high on price.
4
Very economical,clean,tasty food,both at Tekka center(Little India) and Changi airport.All varieties of Dosa,Idly ,Vada,Thali meal(Only veg.Meal),fruit juices etc.available.(And Dosa is a must to enjoy)
5
This is cafeteria style food, cheap tasty and filling. Order on the counter as you go in. Pick a table, grab a plastic beaker and get some water from the dispenser ( on the way to the toilets) The meals are delivered to the table. We have had different thalis, set meals, all were very tasty, good clean spice flavours and my god they fill you up
5
Amanda Bhavan at Changi airport is a must visit for us when we are at the airport either picking or dropping someone. Masala dosa and coffee my usual order but once in a while we eat North Indian food which is equally lip-smacking. Anand Bhavan at Little India is our favorite hangout for late night binging, fast service , excellent food, reasonable priced..what else does a foodie need !!
4
After few days in Singapore, every indian will long for an Indian meal! And for other citizens, you must try something different from the fried rice or pastas! This place is not your fine dining place, nor is it a fast food joint. You stand in a long queue for 15 mins(depending on the time of the day) and then you are given a number which implies that the order will be delivered on the table. What i liked most was that despite these issues, they got the taste absolutely right. warm masala dosa and onion tomato uttapam that i got to savour here satisfied my need for indian food. This is a full vegetarian place and a lot of dishes covering north india to south india is served here. Very economical considering the cost of food in Singapore at other such joints- and best of all- vegetarian

We have visited this restaurant twice during our short visit to Singapore. We stumbled upon this eatery the day we reached Singapore and took the metro to Bugis. Since we had reached early in the morning, we didn't find many shops/restaurants open. While exploring we came across little India, a locality with shops and eateries that are exactly like those in India.. Second time was when we brought these Indian friends we made there to the restaurant cuz they were so done with Singaporean food.Ananda Bhavan is a self-service restaurant and purely vegetarian. Moreover, they promote vegetarianism. We ate their rava idli with Sambhar and masala dosa on first visit and south Indian thali on second accompanied by buttermilk both the times. We loved their food. The thali had a lot of flavors. Their coconut chutney and mango chutney were amazing. Honestly, even South Indian restaurants in India don't do it that well. It is simple food that will go down smoothly; even the spicier ones are great. One thali is good for two people with average diet and they let you share. The restaurant is always busy as a lo of Indian tourists and Indian origin Singaporeans come here for meals. The food is well priced.There are just two washrooms. One per gender and so there will always be a queue. However i feel they should depute a janitor there.The restaurant is pretty noisy but cleanliness and service is apt. Very South Indian in approach - a no nonsense restaurant :
1
We had been there for Dinner, ordered 4 to 5 different variety of items , but none was eatable. Chinese noodles, pav bhaji, mango lassi, was so bad that we had left all food and threw it.
4
Very good South Indian food.
South Indian Meals is very good.
Masala dosai is very tasty.
Don't feel like missing Home.
5
Good and tasty vegetarian meal. Price was slightly on the high end for us (esp. after the conversion); the set breakfast meal was large and could be shared by 2 persons (if not hearty eaters). The restaurant does need a face lift, though.
5
Great vegetarian meals! Been there for lunch and would definitely go again when passing through (Singapore).
5
No words can span the varities Ananda has to offer in Singapore. In fact, it is only in Sg that they offer north indian cuisine too (surprise, surprise !!). The food is too good and few items are prepared better than their Indian counterparts(donno what makes them do that). I got to see a lot of chinese visit these restaurants too
4
I have dined here several times. The quality has remained consistent over the years.. Service is quick and courteous. people working here are so nice. Best items on the menu will be south indian food. However, they offer north indian fare as well.We stick to south indian food here.This restaurant is very affordable for the average traveler
5
Simply the best ! Me and my wife used to visit this place every weekend when we were living in Bahrain from 2002 to 2007 .Still miss their dosa after years the place is super clean and all due to teh owners attitude and dedication to good food. He takes personal interest in every customer that comes .Serving staff is also awesome 
1
The food quality is very inferior, infact u may feel u r at a very low grade dhaba in india, i ordered paneer dish and dosa both felt of very low quality, try the food court at the shoppes , very good qualityand food at same price.its amazing how they can serve such food in a city like singapore. even hygeine is a issue here
4
Very nice South Indian Breakfast and they have different sets for breakfast.You are giiven a number to be put on your table and when the food is ready it is served directly to the table. crowded but quality and service is good.it is a 24 x 7 restaurantprice is slightly on the higher side.they have branches across singapore and in terminal 2 of changi airportGood restaurant if you like south indian breakfas
3
my kids reached singapore and realized they didn't particularly like chinese food (although they do like indian-chinese in india), so we ended up at ananda bhavan a few times esp as our hotel was in the vicinity (parkroyal) and we kept going to mustafa's. the food is not great (it's passable) and the ambience is minimal, but it's convenient. it's not all that cheap either. a set meal is about Sing$9, which is a bit on the high side. there are other vegetarian indian restaurants in the vicinity which may be better. but this is okay if your expectations are not high
4
Try anandha bavan opp to mustafa center.
varities are good. taste is ok. price ....
if you just come out of shopping or tiered then check other hotels as it take a long que and time get your food.
4
The food itself was tasty and reasonably priced. But ambiance needs a face lift and stools are too small for adults. Being at the juncture of Little India the location is very good. Service can also be improved.
4
Located in front of Mustafa Center. A nice place to have Indian
vegetarian food . Also the food is tasty.
4
It's decent self service strict vegetarian restaurant with both south Indian and north Indian variety of food as well as snacks. Overall good choice if you want quick meal while on a shopping trip to Little India.
4
Ananda Bhavan is the McDonald's of Indian food. We always eat at Ananda's when shopping at Mustafa's. It is quick and cheap and really good value for money. The dosaii are huge and this time round I ordered a vegetarian thalis which was huge!! And great value for $$
2
The last time we ate here must have been at least two years ago. We had two vegetarian thalis, one North and one South, some drinks, and the bill came to $37-something. We must have been suffering from momentary memory loss when we went yesterday for a break in between shopping at Mustafa's, ordered 2 cups of lime "juice" (cordial) and a masalai chai. ... The bill came to $9.60 for three drinks. I'm still blinking in shock. I guess these canteen-like restaurants can justify such high costs because of their location knowing they can reliably trap tourists from India and elsewhere and don't expect repeat customers. I don’t understand the glowing reviews about their South Indian food by visitors from India. We’ve been to Tamil Nadu, ate at local coffeeshops (not for the tourist trade) and this isn’t a patch on taste, never mind value
4
Ananda Bhavan in Little India is a good place to have food after a tiring shopping session at Mustafa! Tasty South Indian food at reasonable price is what you expect there. It's a crowded place so don't expect a soothing ambiance - the taste of food should sooth your mind, though :
4
The inside of the hotel welcomes you with a entire wall dedicated on proving why humans are born herbivores and also the comparison between the digestive system of human vs monkey vs tiger which further goes on to prove why humans should only eat vegetarian food. But all this should not bother you as the service and food will surely make you happy that you can indeed like vegetarian food. The coffee and tea though expensive cab be consumed one by two due to the quantity that they give you. It's surely the place to go after a tiring shopping from Mustafa centre..
4
Right opposite Mustafa, this place is far better than Saravana Bhavan.Food quality is above average (komalas opposite ferrer park and kailash parbat are the best in little india in my view)Hygene is just about okAmbience is above averageStaff are very very friendly (best of all the lot) Portions served are great and usually 1 item is filling by itself.A good option for people keen to eat south indian food
4
It is bang opposite Mustfa (that must go to "shopping heaven" for all Indian visitors to Singapore. th eplace is vegetarian and very neat. I love the "self service" nature of the place - so you sit at a table - then go to the counter to order and pay; return with the token number on a flagpole that you place on yoru table. The very affable and fast servers bring your food to you. In fact they are very considerate too. I had ordered a Paper Thosai (note how the dosa is spelt to sound just it should in Tamil - India resturants should learn from this) and coffee and the waiter asked me if i wanted the coffee later, after the thosai. very thoughtful. very reasonable, neat and total VFM
5
They provide the healthy food in the Singapore. food quality is great. Neat and clean restaurant with a good service. Air conditioned.
4
A huge place at the middle of Syed Alwi road serving some mouth licking food. Although they serve other then north indian dishes, but wouldn't advise to try it. They serve some amazing sount indian food and do the masala chai.
4
Anand Bhawan is an Indian Vegetarian Restaurant just opposite to Mustafa centre in little India, Though it is primarily south Indian restaurant yet North Indian Thali is satisfactory. Good south indian food. Cost are a bit high from Indian Standards.
5
Good Indian food !! had North-Indian Thail at SGD9.6+ which is so over-filling and served with lots of love... !! just pampered myself with the delicacies fully. Enjoyed it very well !
5
The south Indian thali Breakfast is hearty delicious and awesome value for money. Please do visit this place if you like authentic south Indian food outside India
3
Nice place in Little India to enjoy vegetarian Indian dishes, especially dosa. Chilli Idle or fried idli (small iddlies made like chilli gobi) is a great item; not to be missed
4
The restaurant situated in a nice and crowded location. Just outside the Mustafa Centre. Serves very tasty Indian food. Pricing of food is also reasonable for the quality of the food and service.The staff are very busy and still serve the food always smiling. The choice of food is great and selective. People coming out after a tiring shopping session in Mustafa feel more relieved after getting into the Ananda Bhavan. The seating arrangements are good, In total the restaurant is maintained very neatly. Vegetarian food lovers paradise, I can say
4
Right at the doorstep of Mustafa Center the shopping heaven for all Indian tourists to Singapore, this Ananda Bhavan restaurant is also open 24 hours.great food anytime, especially after a tiring shopping schedule, a good place to cool the heels literally.They are not staying as a vegetarian restaurant but also promoting the vegetarianism. and they have many branches all over Singapore, i believe they have one in the airport too
4
this place is quite a good option. The taste was quite good, nice clean place and prices were also reasonable. One specialty which we found was the ginger tea. The accompaniments along withe snacks were also good and taste was good. Definitely a worth visit for those looking for vegetarian fare
5
Went here on my first trip to Spore in 2010 with my mother-in-law and have always visited when in Spore. Ginger Tea is great if you are used to traditional Indian Tea in the mornings and the Food is home style cooking and taste and the price you would expect. This is a place for a snack and not dinner. Lunch would also be ok to take a break from shopping in the Mustafa Centre located just opposite literally. If you a familiar with South Indian cuisine I would venture to this restaurant and if you are looking to try something authentic but do not want to pay the high prices I would start here
5
the ambience , the variety of food , the taste of food , superb indian taste , superb service , superb management , simply unforgettable experience
4
Good vegetarian hotel of South Indian kind. Good place for a fast bite. The quality of the food seemed to have dropped over the years. Am I the only one who feels so.
4
Excellent choices unlike Chennai. Serves wide range of north and south Indian cuisines. Prices are slightly steep but that is to be expected in Singapore
4
The food is very good and there are plenty of options for vegetarians. Go for south indian cuisines, they are better in taste then other foods like chinese and north indian.
4
For vegetarians, this is a great place to enjoy a variety of food with burning a hole in your wallet. The food was very fresh and the place was clean.
I recommend this place and is close Mustafa's
4
Awesome location - Opposite Mustafa Center. Didn't have a lot, just the Onion Uttapam and Masala Dosa, both were really great. Combined with thier divine tomato chutney - something we never get @ home in Mumbai. Definately a must visit for all.
4
This vegetarian restaurant is consistently good - I ate here four years ago and the service and food is just as good this time. Everything is vegetarian - but especially good for those who avoid onions and garlic since they also cater for Jains with a good selection of items. We had the Jain set plate which had three sabjis, dhal, rice, sweetcorn soup, chapatis, yoghurt, papadum and gulab jamun. A little over S$9 for the Jain set plate. Everything was very well cooked and tasty - quite spicy but ideal for perking up a lagging appetite in sweltering Singapore. The decor is utilitarian but very clean with a lot of staff taking orders, delivering food to the tables and cleaning up
1
Terrible Paneer Thosai - absolutely tasteless filling and they have forgotten how to make sambhar.The filter coffee too was pathetic.The service took 30 minutes.When I mentioned this to the staff they were non challant about it.Will never go back. I am sure there are other better places in Singapore
4
this is a purely vegetarian restaurant (small chain).thanks to the indian tourists and the expat indian population this restaurant is very popular. of course this restaurant has incorportated indian snacks (chaats etc) and norther indian cuisine to cater to the different tastes. the food is of high standard in terms of quality,quantity and taste.the prices are reasonable (four to six dollars for the snacks) and under ten dollars for a square meal. it is heartening to note that the system of ordering and delivering of the orders to the table has considerably improved. so it is an inbetween a self-service and regular restaurant
4
visited this place with friends for dinner. we chose since this was a pure veg hotel and was just opp. to mustafa shopping centre. we ordered mix of both north indian and south indian veg food. this is a self service restaurant. the food was served quick. the food tasted good. the fried rice was really good. the thali meals had enough varieties for a satisfying meal. we ordered for a mango milk shake which tasted awesome. overall we found great value for money and spent some real good time with some good food
4
This place is a bit expensive as compared to similar category places like Komala Bhawan but the place inside feels much bigger with a better ambience and food taste/quality. A lot of options make you come back to this place again and again.
4
The food was really nice however their ambiance is not that great. The sweets are also delicious. Not many sweet shops in Little India hence you will find stuff here bit expensive.
4
Enjoyed the vegetarian food at Anadha Bhavan. We ordered a few dishes as we went about twice and all were good. This restaurant is a bit expensive.
5
Good indian food. a very good place for vegetarians to visit. like haldirams of india. Meals offer was very good. Overall there were many indian restaurants, this was also good. ambience was not very appropiate although.but good reasonable food
5
Brilliant place to eat for vegetarians... Had north Indian mean - was a delight. Would recommend it to any vegetarian Indian travelling to Singapore. Very reasonable at cSGD10 per person for a meal.
4
This is almost just opposite Mustafa centre Food is good and tasty. sometimes you have to wait for a table. Only thing is items are pricey.
4
The place is good for South Indian food options. Good thing is it is opposite Mustafa and a good place to eat at late night as well.
5
Good choice of menu, everything tasted good and both quantity and quality were good. Would recommend for people who like authentic Indian dishes.
4
This is a 24 hour facility opposite Mustafa, we had breakfast, quantity and quality both were very good, am told Pongal is a daily sell out item. Coffee is also good here
3
For an Indian looking for a typical home food veggie place - this is the way to go - it has extensive menu and I saw families enjoying traditional fare - the thali which consists of variety of food in small bowls - I had a snack (rawa masala dosa) which was crisp and well stuffed with potato filling and filter coffee which was good. The place and seating is very basic but the food is good and tasty and value for money.
