Great experience this evening with family. The roasted duck was really delicious and the chill fried rice was scrumptious! The soups, vegetables everything was fine. Waitress service was excellent and very friendly. Thanks very much.

The duck here are amazing, choose from afew choices mainly due to the difference in spices used while cooking. If available you should order the crocodile meat

The Chinese food selection is wide ranging and delicious. I always take foreigner colleagues to Dian Xiao Er for the wide choice and good taste. The prices are reasonable too.

Great experience on Saturday night. The food is just incredibly good, balanced, tasty and cooked to the right everything. The roasted duck in black sauce is a delight all by itself. The fish and the sea food fried rice were to die for. The tofu with fungus was another delight. The menu has an abundance of different types of food and it was hard to choose. It gets very crowded over the weekends and best to reserve your table. Enjoy as we did

We (3 adults & 1 child) dined here on two occasions over the last monthFood: We ordered a range of fish, tofu, vegetable, meat and soup dishes to go with rice. Good use of fresh ingredients and all were very tasty, cooked to a high standard above what could be achieved by most average cooks at home. Cod fish dish was excellent, albeit a little small for the price. Dishes arrived without too much of a wait.Service: Always helpful and with a smile. With a fussy toddler in tow, who throws spoons and bowls around, we always appreciate understanding waiting staff who would bring clean replacements without rolling their eyes. There is always someone bring to top up your tea swiftly.Would we go back again? Most definitely, even with the pricey menu

We came here for lunch and liked every dish except the claypot chicken which was too salty. The fish skin appetizer, soup of the day (Pork ribs with lotus roots), spicy fish slices, sweet and sour pork, and poached Chinese spinach were all pretty good. Food came quickly, wait staff were well trained, prices fairly reasonable, under $100 for three persons.

Located in a shopping mall, this restaurant would of be easy to pass by and ignore. However, what it lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for with two dishes - the excellent herbal duck with its crunchy skin and oh-so-moist flesh and the slightly unappetising looking Mongolian pork ribs that are guaranteed to have your face looking like you've eaten a mud pie after you've had a couple. Don't be put off by the "herbal" part of the duck dish - the flavours are mild and still let the duck be the star. The pork ribs have a tiny bit of heat - think white pepper - but are sweet and impossible to put down. We also tried a couple of the vegetable dishes which were also excellent. For a simple, relatively cheap dinner, this is a must try if you are staying in the area

Yesterday, I met up with my friends whom I hadn't met for the last 13 years. And with their recommendation, I dine at Dian Xiao Er for the first time.Since the signature dish is the grilled duck, naturally that is one of the items we ordered. My friend let me decide since I was the only lady there. We ordered tofu, lotus roots, and fried Tou Miao (type of vegetables).In fact, I find their pricing very reasonable with the small portion going for $18 (sgd - usd1 = sgd1.42).When the food came, I must say this restaurant offers quality food with reasonable prices. Lotus roots is served with nuts and celery, and it is quite tasty with the mix of ingredients. With the tofu, there are broccoli and mushrooms. I am actually not a fan for the duck meat, but still I am open to try the grilled duck since it is the signature dish. It is actually tasty with some ginseng and not too salty. Most Singaporeans are getting health conscious and at home, food is prepared with minimal salt. When you are at Marina Square next time, give it a try at Dian Xiao Er

Found Dian Xiao Er online and after reading some reviews decided to book for our Chinese New Year's Eve Reunion dinner. They kindly allowed the exception of a funds transfer for the booking as none of us were in Singapore and patiently emailed me constantly until everything was completed. The Signature herbal roast duck with Ten Wonder Herbs was fantastic. A non-duck eater had several pieces. The portions were great for seven - we were stuffed by the time the pomfret arrived. The crayfish with otah sauce was excellent and the asparagus with scallops was also very good. None of the dishes disappointed and the staff were friendly, attentive and efficient despite having to deal with three sittings. Would definitely drop by for a meal again when next in Singapore

A simple chinese restaurant with some v good food. I would consider it in between fast food and a full restaurant.
For two people, I would order three dishes. The best for me is the OLD STYLE FISH.

Came here today for the set lunch with some colleagues. With 4 people it's possible to use the set lunch to get a decent selection of dishes. Food quality was reasonable and the service efficient. Good value for the lunch deal.

Really nothing special..
The food really so so..
Dong po rou too salty and mayonise prawn too sweet. Their fried seafood tofu not bad.
Price at ok range, service quite ok

We were here for a family dinner recently, It being a weekend, it was unsurprisingly busy at dinner time. Nevertheless, we had made reservations so didn't have problems being seated quickly. The restaurant is fairly small, so it's a bit of a tight fit for large groups. We chose several dishes, most of which were fairly average save the herbal duck, the latter being moist and tasty. Prices were also quite reasonable, so it's a decent if unspectacular spot for a meal
4
We ordered a herbal duck, squid with petai, sliced fish, fish maw soup and braised doufu. Skin skin was not forgotten which they refunded. For a chain restaurant, they have maintain consistency especially their herbal duck. The rest of the dishes was good but nothing to shout about. I would be back just for their herbal duck...only.

Came for the weekday lunch together with a colleague on Thursday afternoon and it was too crowded leaving only the seats right nearest to the entrance available. Waiters could tell that it wasn't the most preferred seat and provided us with more attention including providing an additional table so we could feel more comfortable and not too cramped up.Food was spot on as usual with the herbal roasted duck paired with their specialty soup. Service was quick and efficient - did not have to wait too long to food to arrive despite it being its peak as it was lunch.Great experience overall

I love this place and have came back every single time when I am in Singapore. We have tried the ducks in different sauces and it's very crispy with complex flavour and appropriate seasoning. I love the dry fish with lime sauced fried with the vegetables - that's refreshing and definitely tasty.What they have taken out of the menu from years ago was the bao that one can get instead of rice. The service is quick, clean and friendly. One word of caution, get there early to avoid long queue

We're here for the reunion dinner. They've ruined the deco with tacky pink plastic sheets as table cloth! Thankfully the food redeemed the restaurant. Lovely yu sheng with smoked salmon. Sea cucumbers with maw was scrumptious as was the seafood soup. The herbal roast duck didn't disappoint

I have been to a few of their chains but particularly like the one in Jurong Point (JP) where they have moved recently to the basement. Quality of food ~ always good for my visits~ particularly like their herbal duck (never failed me and often have craving for it)~ other dishes are equally good and their soup is always very tasty (I suffer immediately from MSG attack when too much. I believe most restaurants would use MSG in their cooking but the right portion used is appropriate) ~ prices of food is about the same as many other chinese restaurants. A normal whole roasted duck from a coffee shop stall would cost about SGD 28-30. Here in this resto, about SGD 60. Double the price so very steep! For 2 paxs, quarter of a duck is enough to satisfy my cravings with other food compliments. Service~ at JP, good! Staff are pleasant and even suggested that we order enough for 2 and not over order our portions as we may not be able to finishWill I go back? Yes yes yes, for the duck!!! I simply love it.

Recommended by friend who works in HungryGoWhere and must say, good choice for the food. We ordered the dinner set of 4 persons and the portions were just right.After the appetizer, the first thing that arrived was the Herbal Duck which is one of the signature dishes. The almost boneless duck we had comes in a thick dark sauce which is slightly on the sweet side. Cant taste any herbal flavours though.The fried fish is a bit too dry with no accompanying sauce which I thought was a waste. Bear in mind, this is a family/friends type casual restaurant in a shopping mall and Yes, it can be very noisy

Just go for the duck...
For a meal for one pax, the duck drumstick with rice is good. The other dishes are too pricey and not worth the money.

During last 6 months I have visited this restaurant repeatedly because of their fresh, crispy and delicious food. Especially my favorites are their sweet and sour pork and especially seafood combo. I've found that he same food tastes different somewhere else but here you can't go wrong if you choose these. The food is also quite light even if you take rice as a side order. With the food on Tiger beer and that's it. Very good.

Seeing the crowded restaurant we thought we couldn't fail. I had the duck which was boned and difficult to get the meat off. We ordered a glass of red wine each but it was undrinkable. We had the ribs which were good but no water bowl or napkins supplied so ended in a mess. We asked for another wet wipe each which was grudgingly given and wait for this.... We were charged for the wipes we had used. Heard it all now!

For Singapore standards this place is just average. As usual you are billed for wet towels & peanuts or cucumbers or whatever appetizer they put on the table. So don't be surprised. Some restaurants in Singapore now charge for a glass of tap water. Basic hospitality comes at a price of $0.30-$0.60 depending on the resto. We recommend lotus roots macademia nuts mixed veggie, XO fried rice (even small order is a big portion, enough for 3 pax sharing), and old style steamed fish. Marmite chicken was also quite interesting. Beware of this dish of fish slices with chili sauce, menu said it's slightly spicy. It was really delicious but we both ended up with 3rd degree burns on our tongue, teary eyes, runny nose. We panicked & quickly flagged down a waitress to bring a jar of iced water. Whew! Glad we survived to warn other unsuspecting diners. You're welcome! :-

Visited the place for lunch today and started off with the waitress insisting we sit in a specific corner despite us wanting to sit in a less crowded area then proceeded to spend almost a full five minutes trying to get us to order the day's special or desserts. We ordered the Ee Fu noodles which turned out to be terribly salty. We all abandoned the dish after tasting it. The waitresses didn't seem to speak any English so it was a futile attempt trying to send it back.We tried the deep fried kai lan and it was alright. We first had it some time back and were amazed they shredded it and deep fried it till it resembled some sea weed snack. Today's portion came out looking noticably smaller, soggy, more pork floss than vegetable. Disappointing. The duck was pretty good. Not awesome. Good enough

been to quite a few branch of Dian Xiao Er. But this outlet's food are an inch below the rest. If you must have a duck, go to their other outlets, my past 3 visits to this one simply tells me that it's not as good as the other branch

This restaurant is famous for its Roast Duck and this is our 2nd visit. The food has been consistently good and the best part is that they are all mindfully prepared to be healthy as well - the menu even has calorie counts so that patrons make informed decision on their orders. We ordered Roast Duck (with 10 herbs), Spinach with Century and Salted Egg, Kailan with Chicken Floss, 2 types of Soup and they all didn't disappoint! Price point is not too bad as well. Best of both world, we'd say : Tasty and Healthy!

I went to Dian Xiao Er, Tampines 1 and Ordered Family Set A menu for 2 pax.- Old Cucumber soup tasted abit bitter- Baby Kai-Lan with salted fish and lime tasted delicious.- Mongolian Spare Ribs abit spicy but too big a piece- Duck Roasted with Angelica Herb but if you want to change the sauce to Ten Wonder Herbs need to top up $1.00 for the sauce.- Waiter & Waitress does not goes round the table to fill up your tea......Overall, the food is still worth the value

My husband and I went to this restaurant, the branch at Vivocity for lunch today. We asked for recommendations from the waitress, and she introduced us to the Mongolian style spare ribs. They were tender, crispy and to the bite too. We also had vegetables with small salty little fish, which was of a huge portion. We also ordered steamed beancurd with minced meat on hotpot. The size is a bit small though. We only managed to share a bowl of rice, as 1 bowl was of rather large portion. The food was served to us within 5 minutes, and this suited us, as we had a movie to catch in the cinema next door in 30 minutes' time. We were really impressed with the quick service!!!!!!The only shortcomings were that we lacked of $1.30 to get a discount off our total bill, as our bill was just a little short of $50. Also, we were assigned seats on the stools outside, which was without a back to lean on
