my favorite spot to go to over the weekends to drink. Manager and staff of the bar are friendly and warm. Nice live band over at acid bar and they have different sets through the whole night on everyday.

My favourite chill-out place. With friendly staff like Graham, Malou, Raymond and Azusa, makes one feel at home whenever there is a need to have a good old drink. Strongly recommended.

It's a nice place to hang out, chill and have fun, with good service. Deen provides really nice service, friendly and recommend things that will definitely suit your favor. Try this and if you like a chill place, you won't regret it

Seems to look the part in it's ambient setting. Notwithstanding the cocktails were decidedly flavourless as well as being somewhat watered down.. Not worth it whatsoever..

I dropped in here for some drinks after work one day last week. The bar is quite nice inside, although it wasn't very busy early in the evening. Music was a bit loud for a conversation but the Kilkenny was cold and the service efficient. I really wouldn't recommend the nachos: fake cheese which tasted terrible

Had really nice apple martini for just $10. It was a bit quiet when we dropped in at 7.30, but service was friendly and helpful. This would be awesome when busy

We were walking around Orchard Rd and followed the crowd into the Peranakan Street then stumble upon this cute Alley Bar. It was a bar made in an alley, literally, between two buildings. The design is cute and simple, the ambience was great. It was early, we took the happy hour drinks just to get into the bar and look around. The bar was empty (6pm, we were really early), so we left. The shops next to it were also bars. It's a good place for people watching

After more than 2 years living in Singapore, this is the worse experience ever in a bar.The place is nice for sure but after we ordered sangria, we found it without taste and we highlighted it. The manager came to us to explain that from one bar to another sangria has different recipes (????????) and maybe in "my country" there is another taste and that next time I should better ask what is inside before I order !!!!!!!! (In this bar, they put pineapple inside !). I told them that before I order a pizza, I never ask if there is a pastry ! I cannot believe this whole conversation happened telling me that a basic recipe is different from one country to another....I am not Spanish but everywhere I have been so far, sangria is... sangria...Please do not treat your customers like stupid people.

I went out with a friend to chill and just have a cozy evening with wine and beer. The service was quite good and the people around are really attentive. They even move us to a better seat when its available. The place is fine and the prices of the drinks are also reasonable. Good place to go. :

The subject line already tells you it's ok for a group of you to go and drink and snack. But don't expect much more than that.

Good place for gatherings and cool off from the hot weather. Not too noisy so can talk. The staff is helpful and friendly. Cosy place. Like the name implies. It is a back alley but fully Aircon.

Nothing really special here for foods that I ordered was OK as same as the drinks. Lots of place in this area I am going to move forward.

Friend and I were looking for a place to drink after shopping on Orchard. We usually head to Somerset, but settled for AlleyBar for its intimate little corners. Bar was bustling on a Thursday night. we loved the energy and as everyone settled for after-work drinks, but it was never too crowded. Service was pretty good considering the business, and the servers were always there to recommend or help you out. We liked the crowd compared to Somerset, where everyone just stares at you as you sat by the sidewalk - hard to enjoy our drinks. Instead, AlleyBar was dimly lit and tables were small and intimate

It was a quiet Monday night and we were the only people sitting at the bar. Bartenders were just milling around being fairly inattentive. We ordered a couple of drinks, with the intention of being there for a while and were presented the bill very promptly - without even being asked if we wanted to open a tab. After a while, one of the bartenders told my friend he was going to make her a drink (she hadn't asked for one) and took about 30mins to bring the drink to us. She tried it and commented that it wasn't bad and he proceeded to say he would have to charge her for it.. we thought he was joking and brushed it off, continuing our conversation and having a couple more drinks. When it came time to pay the bill, a different bartender, this time female, came over and said they were testing out the drink, were thinking of putting it on the menu and wanted to know how much she should charge us for it! They were using us as guinea pigs when we hadn't even requested that particular drink and still insisting on charging us!! We were astounded and finally said fine, we'd pay $18 for it.. but she then tried to BARGAIN with us and said she thought we should be paying at least $20 if not more because there were berries in the drink. Outrageous!!! Still shocked at the appalling service

It is definitely one of Emerald Hill's highlights, drinks are the best but prices are the highest, too. Atmosphere in that stylish bar is just awesome, always enjoying to be there with friends and business partners for drinks and food/snacks. Staff could be a bit more passionate ... happens always that they forget some orders. See you there ..

What are the odds of finding a green, quiet street right beside the bustle of Orchard Road in Singapore? Well, Emerald Hill is one such place. Alley Bar is one among the many watering holes in Emerald Hill, juxtaposed with the peranakan style building with an acerbic name - Acid Bar!Walking through the dimply lit "alley", dotted with high chairs on the bar, you walk into a covered space with high ceilings and rustic benches that has all the feel of an outdoor area. This gives the place a quite nice ambiance, which I like going back to.I've found their happy hours to be very good - drinks are priced relatively cheap considering the locality. For me, Alley Bar is one place I would go back for couple of drinks while I am in the Orchard area, especially during their happy hours

Good bar with great happy hour deals (for Singapore). Relaxing bar in the Orchard shopping area. The happy hour prices are great for Singapore and then go back to regular prices ~$12 a pint after that. Bar staff is friendly and rather attentive for Asian service staff. If you want to start your night off with a few reasonably priced drinks before hitting other nightlife then you should definitely try out Alley Ba

Great bar. Only at happy hour however, because it is fairly expensive. $12 for a pint of beer in Happy Hour, $20 at other times. Nice strong A/C which was great after a couple of hours walking up and down Orchard Road. Old fashioned decor and good cocktails.

This bar is nice but wasnt anything special in terms of atmosphere. Ordered pizza here for something to eat and it was really lovely. The staff are very friendly and the bar is in a great location just off Orchard Road.
4
Nice cosy place, as the name states it, in an alley, good atmosphere for pre-dinner drinks, I believe it gets busier later at night. Nice selection of wine.

locates in the middle of orchard which is very easy to find. Though, beer in Singapore is not cheap, I would say. There are other bars nearby as well so check it out and then you can choose later.

Good atmosphere and design. Perfect for chilled evening drinks with friends. They have a happy hour early evening and decent bar food.

In my opinion there are two kinds of bars in SG. The superb ones, where drinks are about 30SGD and regular bars with a little bit hit/miss tendencies and lower prices. I don't know about food here, but it was packed full and the atmosphere had a good vibe, very international crowd, nice music and decor. 6SGD for house poured spirits, 3 bottles beers for 22SGD, is very cheap, but beware. After 21.00 the prices are twice as high. I liked the neighborhood of Emerald Hill, an escape from high building and madding stress of Orchard Road. Nice old building and cool small restaurants. A must visit while in Singapor

Lovely bar and seating. Very grand and great setup. You can see the next door bar restaurant through a huge glass wall. Amazing ambience created to be enjoyed. It was late maybe 1.15am so it was quiet a time this bar. But they served us efficiently and the cocktails were tasty and enjoyed by all. Price wise it's Orchard road prime location and therefore reasonable. I would visit them again.

We had been recommended this place so were expecting good things. It was a late night visit but the bar was still open however a few minutes after receiving our very expensive drinks we were told the bar was closing and we had to rush them as the staff were packed up and ready to leave. Very poor

Been here on numerous occasions on both my visits to singapore as near to where we were staying! They have some good happy our deals and whilst not cheap not bad for singapore! The bar outside part looks out onto orchard road and great for watching the world go by! The food is nice for bar food ! The only problem I find with this place is the varying levels of service, if the manager is in or supervisor it is excellent but seems to be go down when not around

I have been to this bar several times to chill and watch the world go by. The location is ideal on Orchard Road and was always a good place to hangout. Having visited there last week with my family I am in no rush to go back. The bar has never been the cheapest drink in Singapore, SGD19 for a bottle of beer/cider, but what do you expect from Orchard Road! Unfortunately the staff have zero to no interest. The girl that served us was abrupt bordering very rude and was clearly not interested. A smile was definitely off the menu. Two of the children each ordered a desert clearly designed for sharing, but, was any advice forthcoming...nope not even an acknowledgement of what was ordered. Poor customer experience...

This is a great place to get away from Orchard St for a bit. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff is attentive. The food is okay, beer selection is small, but cocktails are plentiful. I think I may have neen there at the wrong time cause the bartender was really under trained but at least he looked for help.
