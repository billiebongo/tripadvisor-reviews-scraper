Often come here with colleagues. Serves very reasonably priced and tasty Indonesian food. One of my favourites is the Nasi Goreng Ayam Penyet. Good place for solo or also caters to large groups.

Serving portion was quite big. Chicken curry was yummy! Had to ask them to pack the rest because I couldn't finish. Too yummy to waste. ðŸ˜œ

This is a nice place for good Indonesian food. The Ayam Penyet is good, Nasi Ayam Goreng Set is superb, and the dessert too - the sago melaka is super yummy. Nice deco complements the good food.
