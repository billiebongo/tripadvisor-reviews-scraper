Review by Dr Sim. Chinese food is good. Service is average. Try the roast chicken and braised duck. Ambience is good. A bit far for tourist to go to. Regards Dr Sim

This is very much an average Chinese restaurant, but prices are higher than would be expected or are warranted. There are better and cheaper!

Been here many times and every time I want to put in the review but I forget. Food is good and service is nice. Try the salted egg prawn and the prawn paste. The fried noodle is delicious.

Went there for in-law birth day dinner. The restaurant is located at the ground level of ITE Central @ AMK just along CTE. It is easy to locate the place.Order the set dinner menu:-1) Bun - okay2) Cold dish - okay and there is left over3) shark fin - okay4) steam fish - dry and the taste a bit funny5) chicken with garlic - okay6) mushroom & abalone veg - abalone is hard7) prawn - oily & not fresh8) noodles with pigeon egg - okay (the best out of the dishes)9) yam paste - dilutedThe restaurant can accommodates at least 30 tables. The serving by the staff is good. The foods is just below average reference to the price tag. But the place is crowded maybe due the ease of car parking

We went there for dinner, a table of 6 of us. Food are normal and it is pretty expensive. The table we got there's this fishy smell, we seated for awhile and decided to request for a change. It could be the table wasn't not clean properly.Generally good are just normal, environment to good other than the smell. Services are okay except they are rushing to keep our unfinished plates.Abalone chicken soup is nice... Roasted pork is too salty, char Siew not bad half lean and fats. Vegetable with scallops too plain... Prawn is not bad, it just cook with normal sweet sauce, no wok hey... Fish is well cooked but no fish taste... It feels more like frozen fish.Dessert is nice, mango and pomelo, except my Aunty dislike the bitterness of the pomelo. Mango tempura is not bad... Although they offer us a member card, but don't think we will go back for the dinner again. Maybe we will try the morning dim sum

We visited this restaurant which is situated in AMK ITE Central. The restaurant has great staff who provide excellent service. The food quality is also above average for its signature dishes. You may wish to note that the waiting time for weekends might be long due to the crowd. It is always good to make a reservation if you decide to dine there during weekends.

Family of 8 adults, 3 young children (7,5, 2 yrs old) went to this restaurant for Sunday dinner.Location-----------+ Centrally located in Singapore. + Has free sheltered parking in ITE carpark.Facility---------+ Modern Chinese restaurant. Simple but tasteful aesthetics. Aircon. Clean carpets.+ Table we were sat at can fit 11 comfortably. There were other tables that can fit 12 comfortably too. + Clean washrooms. + Adequate circulation space to walk around.+ Function room can fit 3 tables (not sure if there're minimum spend to use them).Food------My recommendations based on what we ordered and tested (see attached photos for menu):A1 Fried fish skin = $7 x 2 = $14 (Crispy.)H4 Kungfu duck = $27 (half duck but big) (Skin is crispy. Meat if soft. Some fat but ok.)K2 Roast pork (12 pieces) = $14 (Moist meat, crispy skin)P5 Salted egg prawn ball = $27 (M) (Big prawns.)R2 3-cup chicken = $18 (this version supposed to come with frog legs but they ran our of frog legs that day. Dish itself was great with soft chicken pieces.)V3 Chinese Spinach in Superior Soup Stock = $12 (M) (Soup stock was good to drink on its own)B5 Ma Po beancurd = $14 (M)R1 Deep Fried Icecream = $6 (good for 3-4 to try a few bites each. Fried portion was thick though)Portions are big enough, so we needn't orderService----------I was able to make and amend a booking without much problem.Reservation is highly recommended as the place is typically full after 7pm.Because I already researched what to eat before I arrived, I immediately ordered upon arrival. So not much interaction with waiters, other than confirming the read-back order.Food was served pretty quickly within 10min.You can cancel the peanuts and wet towels to save costs.There's 10% service charge and 7% GST
