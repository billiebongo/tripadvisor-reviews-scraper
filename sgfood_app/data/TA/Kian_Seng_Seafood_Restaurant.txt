This is definitely a place for locals. Since it is located inside an industrial park, do wear comfortable clothes to enjoy yourselves. Food is excellent and price is very reasonable.

Have been visiting this place for quite a few times already. Good food at decent prices. Crab is big yummy at $55/KG which is decent. Do give the herbal chicken a try as well.

We are regular Mondays Group that visits this restaurant.Our normal pre-booked covers Cold crabs, Long Tann (Garoupa Head about 2-3 kilos), one roasted suckling pig, salted eggs prawns & exotic dishes before finishing off with a bowl of Orh NI each.Tonight was no difference, we polish all the dishes with bottles or Red Wine.The very friendly & thoughtful owner (ah chiam) joined us for a moment.Mind you he is a Teochew, but his chef & staff comes from wide & far.Service is always good, you have standby attendants whilst they are not too busy.Must admit the food is so much better than many other restaurants & the prices much much reasonable in compariso

Kian Seng Seafood Restaurant located at Blk 4013 Ang Mo Kio Ave this is a pleasing neighbourhood seafood place. During the day serves the local industrial area close by and then in the evenings is visited by locals .Down-to-earth and not somewhere u want to bring someone for a classy meal. It’s a basic place but it’s very busy with people. The tables and chairs are basic and there is a huge open area but if you’re on a average budget this is the place to come for great buzz and atmosphere to enjoy the lovely food that is on offer .Anyway if you are crab lover like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in Singapore. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. We also had other dishes, and they all were scrumptious. But if u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was very crowded. .. We had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

I heard about this place quite a while ago and to my surprise the place was quite packed when I was there for dinner. But to my disappoint ... the FOOD was terrible! These are the dishes we ordered ... Curry Fishhead (Supposed to be 1 of their popular dish) : the Fish was not fresh and it tasted BITTER! You Tiao Fritter with Pork Floss - The You Tiao was so hard and its obviously some overnight leftover food! Hot Plate Toufu - Shouldnt it be served on a Sizzling Hot Plate ... when it was served, it was Sizzling hot at all and the colors of the dish just tells us that this dish totally cannot make it and we were right!! Pork Ribs with Italian Herbs, the ribs was kinda hard and not tender at all. The only edible dish out of the 6 dishes we ordered were the Spinache with 3 diff types of Egg

This restaurant I have visited since young, my grandma's birthday would be held there every year and whole family and relatives will be there to eat the zhi char. Recently went back with my family, the setting of the zi cha is still the same, the price of the zi cha is good and affordable and came in big portion. We have ordered smoked duck, vegetable soup, fried white kway tiao, yam ring and fried tou fu, 5 person total bill $70+ sgd. The food is good, especially the kway tiao and smoke duck, enjoyed our food very much, highly recommended and whenever we got craving for zhi char, will definitely be back again to try out other dishes

Been regular visitor during lunch and sometimes dinner. Good:1) Best Stir Fry Garlic Kai Lan Ever...nobodies disagrees after trying it. It means that the way they process the vegetable, somehow managed to remove the bitter nature of he vegetable completely, leaving behind only the crunchy stems with sweet savory garlic taste! 2) despite heavy lunch and dinner crowds, they are still able to serve out all dishes fast 15-30min during peak periods.3) Price are reasonable, comparable to normal Zi Char at neighborhood coffeeshops. Each dish cost ard $8 onwards. The drinks stall also dun charge premium restaurant rate for drinks. Prices ard $1 for milk coffee to $1.30 for can drinks, and $1.70 for a cooling and tasty self concocted ice honey lemon drink.Bad:1) Can be crowded during weekend evenings2) Non-Aircon3) Other dishes are rather mediocre. But you may discover new gems. 4) Quite a rundown looking restaurant setting in a industrial park

This is a hidden gem that serves really good crab dishes. Chili crabs..black pepper crabs...and my all time fave..salted egg crabs! The way it's cooked is really good and is always consistent. My hubby and I always come here when we have crab cravings and we're lucky to have this place just right beside our home. Best to come early as it gets really crowded at night and it takes a while to get the crabs cooked to perfection !!!!

It is well hidden in an industrial area. Without friend's recommendation, I wouldn't know about this place. Authentic teochew/hokkien food is served here. Reservation is required if you are coming on weekends as this place is overcrowded with many regulars. Salted egg crab is a must to order. Marinated pork is also strongly recommended. You should also try the sinful Stewed pork with bun (kou rou bao) and Cripsy prawn roll. Their roasted suckling pig is also very well received but advance order is required. Their teochew style steamed promfet is well-liked by most elderly. I'll definitely come back again!!
