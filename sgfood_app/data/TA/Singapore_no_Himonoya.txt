This is a great place for an authentic Japanese experience. You can tell when the patrons are mostly Japanese. The food was great and reasonably priced while the sake was fantastic. Check out the secret sale menu - it’s quite an experience!!

Hominy offers a great choice of sake but the service is slow and not very friendly in this Robertson Quay touristic area. Prices are really expansive as is the case in the Quays.

I used this restaurant for the entertainment.We ordered a party course with an all you can drink of SGD 65 per person.The taste of this tavern is not the taste of fake Japanese cuisine often found in other countries, but it seems like the same taste as Japanese tavern.I am in strong agreement that the Japanese resident often uses this tavern.A la carte dishes are excessive prices, but the ordered course has a reasonable price

Been here several times, taking on both it’s a la carte menu and (mid tier, prices at $75/pax) buffet option, the quality of sashimi and all dishes is uncompromising. If there should be one criticism, they aren’t flexible on swapping out any of the buffet dishes - everyone on your table must go with the same buffet option and exact dishes as prescribed. 2-hr free flow alcohol included in the price is a real treat, includes sake, beer, highball, soft drinks, green tea etc. Service is not rushed and ambience is generally convivial.

We took the $65 nett party menu n added stuff. The set that comes with several dishes n 90mins free flow beverages n alcohol. Thumbs on Daikon salad, sashimi is great but thinly sliced, they are famous for their hokke fish which was generous, delicious n perfectly cooked.My fav was tamago topped with salmon roe ikura n crabs. Oishii!Service was great n friendly and they had Japanese speaking staff to

Popular with the expatriate Japanese in the area, this causal restaurant offers great value for money set meals with option of adding free flow of alcohol for a 90-minute period. Ala carte orders and seasonal offerings are available too. Some may find the open area a tad too noisy, but there is outdoor seating and you can reserve well in advance for sectioned-off dining areas

To be fair the food is slightly above average but nothing to shout about. The shell soup, nanban chicken, and grilled salmon belly are good, but the assorted sashimi is a big let down. The Japanese waiter there is full of characters, in a negative way. Aircon and ventilation are BAD! Make sure u got a table near a fan. We sweated throughout the dinner. Asked the Japanese waiter if there is anything he can do he replied with a flat NO n rushed away. Towards the end a female waiter saw us sweated so much n kept fanning ourselves with the menus, she pulled a standing fan n reoriented it's direction toward us. Oh yeah, don't order it's 2nd grade green tea, costs $4.80 a cup with NO refill, super ridiculous. Definitely will not go back as there are tons of other Japanese restaurants with better food n service n ambiance

Had a private room with no minimum charge requirement which gives us some privacy for gathering. They don't have a big selection of food but they do offer some choices that we haven't tried in other Japanese restaurants. The place is usually filled with Japanese customers and most of their staff are Japanese, and the atmosphere is like dining in Japan. The octopus with wasabi sauce is a good appetiser to go with sake.

Was by myself and decided to check this place out. I was a bit early as I realised that they were only opened at 6pm. So I went to another bar for a few beers prior to that. Came back later at about 645pm because I was craving some sake and a light meal. A bit quiet, I think not many people know about this place yet. But I'll definitely be back!The set meals are abt $19 which I thought was quite ok.The sake which I asked to be recommended was spot on and cost me $39. Worth every penny. I like my sake sweet and he did keep his word. Waited for me to taste to see my reaction. I said "good"! He pat his chest in relief jokingly. Good service.

Sea food especially the grilled fish was awesome .. may be the best i had in singapore.The price was also reasonable for the set dinner we ordered ... the desert with some kind of jelly , sea weed and honey was very unique and very authentic ( japanese )one.Overall value for money and good quality food
