Came here to celebrate a birthday. The place is new and romantic with soft lightings. The steak was very well done and service was top notch

The T-bone steak was great, really char grilled on the outside and juicy inside.
Service from the manager Giuseppe was good..

Just finished our dinner at this restaurant. Hands down the steak was awesome with the surprise Tiramisu cake. Big thanks to chefs! Whole service team was delightful. But what will bring us back is the 2 superstar, Jackie and Mr Raman. Jackie always with a smile and keep track of the food delivery and Raman its just speechless for the whole dining experience. Will definitely returned soon. Great job Bistecca!

Have been trying for last 3 Saturday nights to get a table here but always booked out. Finally got to try the new menu at the renovated premises. Overall verdict: a little disappointing.Nothing really too exciting on the appetiser list. We shared a salami board... no bread accompanied it so literally just eat slices of salami by itself... didn’t really feel right.Steaks were okay and wish I could promote better than that. I just find it really uninspiring to be served a steak on a plate completely ungarnished! Literally just a steak with some rock salt on the side of the plate. What’s that about? How difficult would it be to include a small potato gratin or some veg, if nothing else to add some colour to the plate. Cheap for you to do but makes a customer feel so much better, especially when forced to then order side dishes, all of which were below par.Desserts were unimaginative and bland for the most part.Service was as slow as a wet week.I live beside this place and used to love it.Will try it again in a few weeks

Husband and I came here from a recommendation from a friend. Love a good steak so was looking forward to dining somewhere that specialises in it.Was surprised the bread wasn't served with balsamic vinegar and olive oil as the texture of the bread lended itself very much to that coupling. Bloody Mary not offered on the drinks menu which unfortunately I've experienced at a lot of places here in Singapore so I guess they just don't really drink it here, however, again, would have expected a place like this to serve it as the savoury nature of the drink is similar to the theme of this restaurant.Very long wait to be served all evening despite the place not being that busy (from what we could see outside, anyway). Staff were polite and very well presented, and one in particular went out of his way to get me the WiFi password which was highly appreciated.The steak: Was undercooked. Dreadfully so.I actually don't mind my steak cooked blue from time to time, but this time I asked for my ribeye medium-rare, and my husband, having a fillet (a very thick, tender, expensive cut), asked for it cooked medium. Both came out blue. Like I said, I didn't mind too much as I like a blue steak, but why ask if you're not able to cook it properly and to customer's requests?As for my husband, he was very disappointed as a blue fillet steak is just a wasted meal as the cut goes very cold very quickly due to it being so thick and undercooked in the middle.However neither of us mentioned this as the wait was so long in the first place that we didn't want any further delays and just wanted to eat.The "steak fries" to us just tasted like normal thick cut oven chips - nothing "fries" about them and certainly didn't appear the homemade skin-on experience we were expecting. Husband's beer was served in a brandy glass which was odd.Good points:Béarnaise sauce was deliciousThe meat was very tastyThe venue itself is decorated beautifully and would be a lovely place to go for a drinkThe mushrooms served with the steak were delicious and a fantastic portion size (nice and big)Asparagus cooked very well. Nice and crunchy Waiter did tell us what was NOT available as we sat down, therefore avoiding that awful moment later when you pick something off the menu only to be told it's not available. Wish more restaurants would make the effort like this place does to tell you well beforehandWould we return? For drinks, definitely. For a meal? Would like to think we would return, and if the steak came out undercooked again this time we would say something (because after looking at the bill we kicked ourself for not saying anything!), and IF it was undercooked this second time, then no, we would probably not return again as to us that would prove that they don't know how to cook steak properly

Had the 150gm striploin steak and didnt quite expect the cut that I was served. But I must say that the steak was very good, very juicy and tender. Sides had to be ordered separately. Due to the crowd for the evening, the waiting time for the steak was longer than normal. To make it up, the staff offered desserts on the house.When it comes to cost, not exactly the cheapest. The striploin was SGD90 and sides are on an average SGD12 per selection. The standard 200gm tenderloin goes at SGD60+. Even then, the place runs a full house on a sat night with at least 2 sittings. If budget is not an issue, worth giving the steak a try
5
Came here several times and first time after their recent renovation. Moving to the next door and it becomes bigger in sitting capacity by moving the kitchen to the back of the restaurant. Ordered a seal for sharing , lamb rack , risotto , spaghetti , burrata cheese is out of the world , mussel cooked in white wine sauce and lovely oyster! Good selection of wine and of course the lovely dessert .. tiramisu
5
This place has a great atmosphere and offers the typical fayre of a Tuscan steakhouse. The wine list was comprehensive. You've definitely got to try the Burrata as a starter and Fiorentina as a main. The service was excellent. Its not cheap but worth it in my opinio
5
Having dined in Bistecca before it underwent renovation works, I'ld say dining in the new Bistecca is a way more enjoyable experience.Our table ordered the scallops, steak tartar and octopus to start and we were all blown away by how good they were. The scallops were well cooked. The tartar, fresh and whet up our appetite and the slow cooked octopus, tender and soft. Accompanying our starters were well crafted cocktails that were not only delicious but unique even though they are based off traditional cocktail recipes. The 'Fiorentina' t-bone was shared amongst the three of us and it was nothing short of spectacular. The charcoal cooked steak was optimally charred (cooking time takes awhile because of the cooking method) and we were glad that we heeded the advice of the service staff to order starters while waiting for the steak. Accompanying the steak were; heirloom carrots, creamed spinach and fries and all of them were cooked well and were really delicious. To top it all off, we had the warm black forest, Panna cotta and traditional bread pudding for desert and we loved all of them as well. All in all, new Bistecca is in every way better than the old. Be sure to make a booking to avoid disappointments as they are almost fully booked every single day. Also, take note of the second seating timings if you were to book on weekends. Service wise, all was good from start to finish, the wine sommelier, service crew and managers were really helpful and attentive throughout our dinner. Please visit if you want to impress your date.

It's not hard to find a decent steak in Singapore, but finding a great steak at a price that doesn't require a major financing operation is not so easy. Also, although US-style steakhouses have their attractions, it is a pleasant change to enjoy a steak the Italian way. Bistecca certainly hits the spot.We shared a beef tartare starter - delicious! Our main: a shared 1.1 kg Fiorentina T-bone, cooked medium-rare exactly as we had asked, was not far short of spectacular. The side of creamed spinach with garlic (our nod to healthy eating) was a good accompaniment - and all that we needed.Each of us had a well-made Aperol spritz aperitif, and a glass of rather good Nebbiolo with the main. The service was pleasant and efficient. It was a Sunday evening, and there were plenty of carnivores dining. Our outside table on the front terrace, on a cool evening, was just right. Make sure you book
5
Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. We have the 1.1KG bistecca alla Fiorentina with green salad as well as grilled Octopus. We kept it simple to readlly enjoy the big steak.
5
What can I say! Been to Cut, Morten’s etc but this restaurant is a cut above the rest! Everything is excellent from food to setting and service. You won’t find these in cut or morten’s! We had the Florentine steak and is better than the top steak restaurant in Florence!
5
A casual steakhouse where you can wear flip flops and still feel very comfortable. We ordered the wagu ribeye to share - it was giant and extremely tasty. Service was top class and deco is also very nice. The handmade mozzarella is so fresh and tasteful - highly recommended. Only disappointment was that, we ordered half a bottle of 2014 red wine, which was recommended by their in house sommelier, when we started drinking the wine it was very dry - almost sour when tasted, but after 20min it was properly full body - thought the in house sommelier should know this and offer to decant it first.
3
The food there is quite amazing. The appetizer like bread with garlic salsa sauce, the octopus is highly recommended. The steak is very juicy and served with 4 different sauces which give you the various combination of flavors.The service men are quite polite and helpful.But there are some bad things for dining experience, their knife edge for steak cutting is not saw type, so very difficult to cut the steak piece like rib eye with fats and tendon. Also the plate for serving the steak is rectangular with round base, so it keeps spinning when I was cutting. Last awful thing is the background music. It is a superior restaurant (at least based on price) for Italian dinning, but can you imagine it is playing some popular music very loud! Quite inappropriate for the conversation and the overall atmosphere. Sometimes cannot concentrate in dining, but luckily its delicious food win some points back.The overall experience is good, but above mentioned details are annoying for your important event. Maybe they are just re-opening after renovation and take some time to adjust.
5
Re-opened recently after a move (just next door, fret not) and a full make-over. Now it's a lot cosier and the al-fresco dining area is much more welcoming too. Food and service are great as usual and still think they serve the best florentine T-bone in Singapore. Order the 1.1kg T-bone which is great for 2. Love their service and it's truly a great place to enjoy everything Tuscany can offer! Will be back
4
steak was tasty as i remembered it to be. i had the 1.1kg florentina with to go along with it. i did find the wine to be on the pricey side
4
Was roped into the 1.1kg wagyu steak at $180!!! It’s not the Wolfgang of New York standard but is still pretty darn good. Still to try the new SG location. Anyways this one here at Bistecca was spot on in terms of rareness and along with its assortment of sauces salt etc ensured that every tastebud was catered for. For me I think it was just too much. Yes you can have too much of a good thing. When it’s of that price and quality you really want to enjoy it. Not force to eat it cuz u spent so much on it.. lol anyhooo Bitesticca serves a pretty mean steak I would definitely return for mor
5
The T-bone is gorgeous, following the advice of Medium served, and it would be even greater for eater as it's really a big one. Very impressive, the plate was properly warm before the serving. The in-house red wine steak sauce is so unique, and perfect with the steak, though at the beginning it was forgotten to bring to the table, maybe it's quite early of the evening.. All in all, it IS a sTEAk House, real steak in a old-fashion house
5
My son, who is a steak connoisseur, choose Bistecca Tuscan for our family’s Christmas lunch after doing some internet research. He will now be in charge of all celebratory outings! We had a lovely meal at Bistecca. Excellent food, service and vibe. If you are looking for a great steak place with all the trimmings, but without the pretentions, this is the place
1
I've been to about 15 steakhouses in Singapore. Experience wise I'd recommend you To go somewhere else. Sadly the food is not worse than other steakhouses but the service was just shockingly bad, well, actually just one waiter whom they should seriously retrain. First, I was ordering a steak. He cut me off and asked my companion what he wanted. I asked if I could please finish ordering. I then politely asked him to have my steak not charred, to which he replied that it's not a good idea. I insisted. My server relented and said ok. How nice. My steak came charred. More importantly, My companion had to return his ribeye because it was rubbery (note: HOW CAN RIBEYE BE RUBBERY). That's almost cardinal sin. Go to mortons. Luke's. Anywhere else. Maybe slightly more expensive but worth the decency and much better service. Or at least if you had my waiter, ask for another one. Can't be worse. Or maybe they should just have better trained the waiter. Oh! Almost forgot!! When my companion went to the bathroom this waiter came by and asked if "we were good". No, no, you suck and should be better trained. We are not good.
4
Dinner during one of my last stays. Nice smaller restaurant, somehow different compared to my other experiences in Singapore. Looks more as a family owned italian restaurant.
Good steaks, kind service.
5
T-bone steak is ridiculously priced and incredibly expensive, but it's very very very good and I don't regret the $200 I spent.
5
Food and service is fantastic. We loved the bread and asked for more which they galdly gave us. My younger son who do not take beef also tried and asked for more.
5
Three of us went for my birthday dinner recently. We shared the Fiorentina, the Ravioli and the Risotto for sharing and the Tiramisu and the Rhubarb yogurt dish for dessert. The food quality is amazing, great ingredients and traditional preparation. Loved it.
5
Was recommended to try for the Costata as it's jucier. It was 'rare' and fantastically done. Best I ever had in my life.. they will be close for 2mths renovation from 3sep. Catch them soon.. Only if the aircon is working it will be better..
5
Tried Bistecca Tuscan restaurant out last week as my Son had asked to go for a steak. Made a reservation in advance but could only confirm outdoor seating. On arrival an inside table was being vacated and we were able to utilise this - centrally located . Steak was cooked to perfection, and was tasty - rib eye for two. Sides were good also. Black Forest dessert was nice and made a nice sweet conclusion to the evening. High quality steak as advertised. The meal was much more reasonably priced than some of the more famous steak eateries in Singapore. Ambiance is good, although I wasn't impressed by the large print copy of artworks on the wall. Notwithstanding I was there to eat steak - not admire the decor. Would return anytime. Great steak - enjoy.Reservations essential I believe.
5
Ordered the steak for 2 and it was one of the best if not the best we had. Excellent service attitude with a genuine heart and know their food well . It was a Wednesday night and the place was full house but never lacking in service . Looking forward to coming back for more .
4
Overall very pleased with our selection of tenderloin and grassfed ribeye. Well cooked and the meat was excellent. The gratin we ordered for sides was a little of a letdown as it feels under seasoned and lack the oomph. My husband was given a complimentary tiramisu for his birthday. That was unexpected.
5
We went on a whim for a late 2100 booking. This place was about half full with a clearly happy clientele - we chose inside although some tables are available outside.The menu selection is modest and they clearly focus on their specialities - ie meat! It's not a place for veggies.....We both chose grass fed tenderloin - the 200gs was plenty enough! Compliments of the Chef was some chicken's liver pate that tasted divine. Our steaks came with chips (my wife) asparagus and potato gratin (me). The portions are pretty big but a little pricey. The steak was fabulous and cooked to perfection! Really really good.I was guided to a very nice Valpolicella - really quaffable. I think the wine was a little over priced but went well with the food.The service was impeccable - our "waiter" was exceptional and we discovered had worked at Scott's in London one of our favourite UK haunts.Overall a little pricey but great quality and service - in this sense you could argue good value. I strongly recommend this place.Note they're about to move next door and refurbish so might be offline for a while

Had an anniversary dinner there - the experience of service from start to end was fantastic - a cut above the rest definitely. Multiple waiters catered to our calls, but all were knowledgeable in general aspects. Demonstrated good knowledge of the wines and made recommendations spot on according to pairing our steaks whilst matching our wine preferences. My partner ordered and thoroughly enjoyed (the Tenderloin, F1 Australian Black Wagyu 420 Day Grain Fed - it was blissful. Of course, I had some to be able to provide a review on the meals, we shared our meal. This was probably one of the best Tenderloins I have personally tasted, so major props to the preparation, and cooking technique to achieve a steak that approached near perfection .I was very optimistic about the Ribeye I ordered, 200 Day Prime Grade American Angus, but was sorely disappointed. The doneness was accurate, however the texture was suboptimal, and taste was far more bland than the Tenderloin, which is never usually the case in comparing the two cuts together. Having had to add a decent amount of salt partially made up for it. I really wish I could praise it but it honestly felt like a 20 Dollar steak. The Creamed Spinach was a delight and highly recommended as a side. I wouldn't mind coming here again, but I'd definitely be ordering that Tenderloin or the Fiorentina instead
5
we had wagyu, tiramisu, sorbet, red wine (amarone). superb food and excellent customer service. it was nice of them to waive my wife's dessert due to her birthday. will def come back again!
4
Had a the specialty Fiorentina, a thick cut, char-grilled T-bone steak to share. Between the two of us surprisingly it wasn't much and we had to get extra sides of salmon, asparagus and potato fries. Wine was good but on the pricey side.
4
The quality of meat is first class and the portions are huge, as indeed are the prices! Very good service too. A restaurant for a special occasion.
4
Costata steak was not bad but the 300g ribeye was better! Mac and cheese and burrata yummy too. Desserts - tiramisu and blackforest were soooo good. Good meal :)
4
We had a delicious meal here for my husbands birthday. It was not cheap at all but really good nonetheless.
4
The scallops were succulent a hint of smoky aroma. The steak was excellent, highly aromatic and slightly charred on the outside but juicy and moist on the inside. Only negative was the warm temperature due to air conditioning failure.
5
My wife and I shared the Wagyu Beef Tartare for entree.We then had the Pork Cutlet and Lamb Saddle for main course.All dishes were delicious and perfectly cooked.We would recommend anyone looking for a great feed at reasonable prices to give this restaurant a go

This restaurant has potential, but during my visit I experienced numerous problems that have to do with imperfect execution.The prices are high and appropriate for a fine dining establishment so my review will present a suitable benchmark.I arrived for lunch. The place was mostly empty but for 2 other tables.They brought 3 small pieces of bread that tasted freshly baked. They brought some olive oil (medium scores for the taste which was very bland and unexciting) and some salt. I was unsure what to do with the bowl of salt flakes.When they refilled the bread basket, the next batch was cold, dry and tasteless. No justification for that.I ordered tagliatelle with meat and fois gras. When it was served the taste was good, and the meat was tender. A dish with potential to be a signature dish. But…..it arrived warmish cold. No justification for that in an open kitchen with at least 4 cooks serving 5 diners.Also, the amount of pasta seemed quite small for a main course priced dish (28 SGD). I returned the dish.They made a new plate which arrived hot …..but…. the meat was dry and overcooked and the sauce was unbalanced and tasted different and less appealing than the first dish. No justification for this. The portion was small. The taste was an utter miss compared to the one served 15 minutes earlier. Why?I ordered the Agnelo, lamb rack. It had nice flavor and the meat seemed to be of high quality…..But…..the meat was slightly overcooked and not as moist as it should have been. The spice rub was tasty by a bit too salty. No justification for that.I ordered potato gratin…it arrived hot in a nice presentation…But…the potatoes although cut thin were a tad undercooked and not soft….Why?I ordered the warm black forest dessert. It read intriguing but the end result was quite poor in taste. Surprisingly it arrived within a very few minutes from ordering. The valhrona chocolate custard came out as chocolate "water" runny and melted. There was much too much chocolate crumble overpowering the dish, the chocolate was unbalance and too bitter and lacked finesse of a fine-dining desert. Overall a very poor plate of dessert. While the other dishes were potentially a good concept, the dessert was overtly poor in concept and execution. Bitter chocolate "water on top of it a lot of dry crumble and a few cherries. ok ice cream but nothing special. Again very poor balance and execution and a poor quality dessert.The place was very hot and poorly air-conditioned even when almost empty. They left the doors open and the heat and humidity came in. When another table complained they put some kind of small electric device near the person who complained. But what about the rest of the diners who were sweating and uncomfortable? No one cared.Throughout the meal, workers came in and out, carrying boxes and supplies, some in rubber slippers making noise while walking by, not the atmosphere of a fine dining establishment. The toilet floor was full of water.It seemed as if the restaurant does not appreciate guests coming for lunch.What a shame…Good potential, quality produce (for the most part) but poor execution, poor consistency, poor quality assurance and poor ambiance.All of these can and should be remedied, but the meal I had was definitely not worth the high prices they charge. Could have been a venue for some nice events, but I would hesitate to recommend it as it is because I would be very concerned with the poor execution, and worry my guests would not enjoy a fine dining experience
5
As a steak lover, my Husband loves the steak and mentioned that it's one of the best steak he've eaten. We were being served a surprised dessert as it's his birthday and the service was excellent. Definitely going back there again. Try the moscato, it's wonderful!
5
I went for dinner when i was visiting Singapore and had a table outside.The Manager looked after us and select few dishes for us to try.We started with a lovely Buratta cheese followed by scallops and we finished with Fiorentina. Perfectly cooked.We had a great time. Thank you very much!!!!!!
4
Had fun a few nights ago at Bistecca with some friends from work.
Ordered the 1.1kg crostata steak to share, and a few sides. Steak was great. Sides were pricey though.
5
The atmosphere was great and the staff are very friendly.
All the foods and wine that the staff recommended were very satisfactory.
I will revisit shortly.
4
One of the best places to have steak. Was here for a special occasion and started with oysters...amazingly fresh and succulent, followed by mains...waghyu steak...juicy and one of the best steak I have tasted....and dessert was tiramisu..... 0_0....to die for !!!The staff recommended me the right wine to pair with my steak and that made the dining experience betterThis is not a cheap place to dine but it was worth every dollar spent. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good steak...Make reservations as it gets fully booked on weekend
5
Decided to bring my boys on my birthday & try out their steak & we were not disappointed. Nice ambience & really friendly staff especially Joseph. The meat is juicy & tender & actually really filling. Probably we're small eaters. Joseph even brought a complimentary Tiramisu cake with candle for me too. How sweet of him ! Overall, a bit pricey in my opinion but a superb experience & I'm glad my boys enjoyed it as much as I do ! Thank you Joseph for making it extra special

It's a lovely little restaurant space. Very nice for a date or a quiet dinner with friends. I think it's also child-friendly as I saw quite a few families.The appetizers were fantastic - the burrata (300g per order!) is a huge portion easily shared among at least 3 persons; the octopus had a nice char and was tender; the salumi was fabulous, especially if you pair them with the burrata.The sides were also delicious - the potato gratin was decadently rich with cream and the creamed spinach was amazing. When the creamed spinach first arrived, I was unimpressed with how it looked - it looked more like freshly sauteed spinach instead of the mashed up creamy concoction I was typically used to. But then I was so pleasantly surprised when I tasted it! They blended a creamy spinach puree into freshly sauteed spinach and it was the most brilliant idea! The result was a light but still very luxurious dish.The beef was disappointing. We tried the cote de boeuf. They do advertise their beef as grass-fed and noted that such meat is usually less fatty but more flavorful. Our beef was certainly less fatty indeed but I failed to find the flavor. It was cooked to a medium rare as requested but the flavor of the beef was really just not there.Desserts were really good. We had a tiramisu and a tartufo (which is a hazelnut ice cream dessert). Both were excellent and really hit the spot for me.Service was adequate. The sommelier came across as rather standoffish but no matter as the rest of the service staff were pleasant enough.I would go back again to try their other dishes but I wouldn't order the beef
5
My family went there to celebrate Fathers' Day and one of our birthdays. I would like to commend Jenna for giving us excellent service. She was very friendly and her recommendations were spot on - not only in the type of dishes to order but also the quantity. I had ordered 3 pastas, 2 sides and the Fiorentina (F1 Wagyu) to share among the five of us but she advised me to order only 2 pastas as she thought that there might be too much food. We had 4 desserts - the Panna Cotta, Tiramisu, Semi Freddo and Warm Black Forest. The highlights for me were the Fiorentina, the Risotto (very smooth and creamy) and Panna Cotta (consistent texture right through and it went really well with the pistachio topping). However, some of us preferred the Semi Freddo. Try them all if you have the stomach space. Thanks Jenna, for making our dinner such a special experience
3
Went on a Friday night, just two people and we were given table 9. It felt like sitting half way in the kitchen.The service is fast in asking for orders and the waiting to be served is no quite to the standards. One of us being vegetarian, choices were quite limited and this being a Steak house, it's perhaps to be expected.Ordered the Burrata and tomatoes and it was a very nice pick. As a main, went on with the raviolis, quite dry and very average taste.Ordered a 300grs steak grass feed Scottish beef with spinach and gratin potatoes as side dishes. The steak was excellent, juicy and cooked to perfection, no seasoning were needed to enjoy this part of the meal.Side dishes, particularly the spinach was excellent.Overall, 300S$ for 2, including 5 glasses of wine. Nice gesture from the management on discounted the Raviolis from the bill after enquiring why it was hardly touched.While I might go back one day, it would not become my favorite place in Singapore, even for steaks. The overall combination of the waiting, the table we were given, the poor Raviolis and the overall ambiance and mixed signals of modern glass kitchen, a rather cool terrace seating with a more traditional decor in the back of the restaurant didn't quite compensate for the excellent standard on steaks.
4
I would not rate this as excellent as so many people have, but for me it was definitely an enjoyable experience. Good service, nice restaurant, and good food. But, the food was not spectacular. I might go again, but could also look for other options because of the price tag
5
We celebrated Father's Day at Bistecca. The steak didn't disappoint - the Fiorentine steak was delicious and every bit of it was done to its medium-rare perfection. In comparison, the tenderloin and the ribeye were not as tasty, though still good on it's own. If there's a negative aspect to Bistecca, I'd say that the restaurant could be a little cooler to increase the comfort level of dining there.

I came here the night before leaving Singapore and heading back home to SF. It was kind of a goodbye dinner since my travel partners and I were all heading home to different places. We made reservations around a month or so prior, im not sure if its required but my guess is probably not. We ordered many items but the ones that stood out were the large salumi platter and the steak fiorentina. The service was great and we were checked on multiple times.Salumi - The large size salumi platter was a great appetizer that the 4 of us shared it came with 4 different types of cured meats along with an some olives and a picked tomato.Fiorentina - The steak was amazing! We ordered it medium rare. It was super soft and juicy. It was seasoned very simply which is how i think a steak should be seasoned. It came with 3 different sauces which were pretty good but it was ok to eat on its own.Being a foodie, I enjoyed this place but thought it was a bit expensive for what it was. While traveling i always try to eat food that is more “authentic” and a bit cheaper to try to keep the cost down
5
Enjoyed the food .. n very good customer service .. love the appetizer carne n the A5 wagyu steak. Even the tiramisu has e perfect taste to it ..
5
Took our visiting son and friends to Bistecca. Great drinks at bar, followed by awesome Buratta and Steaks for all. As usual, outstanding food and great atmosphere.
5
The steak was fantastic. Seriously seriously good. Easily the best I've had in Sgp in my 4yrs here. Service sas excellent as was the wine and cocktails. However the star was the steak. I would go back just for that!
5
Tried their char grilled tomahawk steak. Excellent portion for 2. Sides will be a bit burnt but the inside is tender. I feel this place is better than Wolfgang in terms of food. Aircon slightly warm though initially but service staff switched our seats.
5
Some of the best service in Singapore. Great wine list, too. Steak is delicious but pricy. Appetizers and pastas are almost a good deal for the quality though.
5
I don't go to Bistecca very often, as it's a bit pricey, but it's the place I look forward to most of any restaurant in Singapore. Amazing meat, cooked perfectly, accompanied by lovely wine. I also love how the sommelier recommends sensible wines that are always good. Will definitely return, next time we're ready for a treat
5
From the outside this looks like an average restaurant particularly when you see s half converted building directly next door. Any building works had finished when we arrived early evening.The restaurant is nicely furnished and tables are adequately far apart.Service impeccable and discreet.The food is very good indeed ... steaks are sublime Happy to ensure I will return soo
5
Bistecca is hands down one of the very best steakhouses in Singapore. Quality is top notch, preparation is near perfect (I had the Fiorentina medium rare), and clearly well rested steaks make the meal truly memorable. The wine selection is also fantastic and it was great to interact with a relaxed sommelier that sells the wine you want, not the price he wants. The meal gets pricey when you go all out, but going all out is well worth it too
5
I had asked a prominent Singaporean friend that which is the best steakhouse in Singapore and he answered me in a flash Bistecca! And Bistecca did live up to that recommendation! The steak was done to perfection and the char grilled crust gave it the right flavor! A must try is the Burrata and of course with the cherry tomatoes added! Will be back again many times for sure!
5
I am extremely pleased that we've finally visited the place. We ordered the burrata which was just fine. The Patate was super nice and the creamed spinach was ok. The highlight of our visit was of course the Bistecca Alla Costata- Signature Wagyu bone in ribbeye 1.1 kg of heavenly beef! I will always think about this steak (and Ola Cocina Del Mar's) when I try other steaks :)
4
Just had a birthday dinner for my dear friend and it was a awesome one. The Fiorentina Signature Wagyu F1 t-bone & Tiramisu were excellent! Looking forward to another visit soon
5
Food was great but I don't like the furniture as it is not comfortable and chair was a bit shaky and not firm.
5
Fantastic food. Great service! The waiters are doing a super job. Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Will come back 👏
4
Been here a few times & the steak has always been fantastic! Service is a little lacking though since there were only 2 staff on the ground
4
Overall the food was well prepared and well timed. Attention to detail was good. Good place which caters to different occasions.
5
Steak tenderloin was delicious. Sides were lovely. Wine good also. Service very helpful and efficient.
5
I visited last night with my business associates, I was so impressed with to food quality . The bar area a bit squeeze, good choice of cocktail, wine and drinks. The ambience is cosy and we booked a private room for 20pax, great place to have steak and socialise. The truffle risotto and rabbit, pork chop and oysters were great ! Must book in advance especially Friday and they have 2 settings, 630 and 830 for weekend. Enjoy and you won't regret!

I booked my birthday brunch there looking forward to the legendary steak. However, the steak had a gamey taste and smell, and the potato gratin was not properly cooked. The service was top-notch though, with the servers being very attentive and even remembering my birthday with a complimentary slice of tiramisu

Arranged a surprise birthday party for one of my oldest friends here as I knew he was a steak lover. We sat outdoors, service was attentive and hospitable, big shout out to Jackie and Chip for their special care and attention! Cocktails were amazing, wine as recommended by Chip was GREAT and the food was glorious â€” mouth-watering succulent steaks with medium rare done-ness. The oxtail tagliatelle was perfect for pasta lovers. The burrata was gigantic and so soft and creamy; ultimate comfort food in a serene colonial setting

The good:-amazing food, great burrata, and grilled meats. Everything cocked very well.-service very attentive-salads, very fresh and tasty-large portionsTo improve:-ambiance and decoration. Could be improved. Ugly aircons sticking out.-limited wine by glass list-bread quality, unimpressedWill be back for the good food

Best steak house in Singapore for those in the know. You can feel the quality. Very stable throughout the years amidst opening / closing of many places.
5
Went there for a birthday dinner with 7 pax Wonderful service and excellent food. Truely enjoy the night
5
Service was great, so was the meat. Steaks to the point and good cocktails, too. We had a wonderful evening.
5
Love the steak here. Nice quiet restaurant with good ambience. Service is excellent. Price of food is slightly high
5
It was indeed the best steak ive ever had here in Singapore so far.
I just didnt like the music playing. It doesnt match the vibe of the resto.
But everything was perfect!

Visited Bistecca on a weekday with my family to celebrate my birthday and all of us agreed thy the whole dining experience was simply amazing. The wine sommelier; Chip, gave us excellent wine suggestions that made sense. The service staff were friendly, attentive and paced our meal well. For starters we ordered the famed Polipo, Burrata cheese and scallops. They were all well cooked and amazing, well worth the price. We then had a few pastas namely the Oxtail Pasta, Squid Ink pasta and the Rabbit and Foie gras tortellini. Once again, all of the pastas were amazing and cooked to perfection. As for steaks. We went with the suggestions given by the service staff and had one of the Costata; bone in ribeye, and the Fiorentina; t bone steak as well as some sides: creamed spinach, mixed mushrooms with potato gnocchi and the layered baked potato. Both steaks were cooked perfectly. Service wise, there is nothing much to complain about. The food came at the perfect pace and the service staff were all courteous.

LOCATION Typical steakhouse style a bit brighter. Very nice open kitchen and grill. I enjoy the outdoor high table and high chairs better. SERVICEProfessional and attentive. The Italian GM is well experienced, knowledgeable about wines & food and helpful. Executive chef is charismatic and likes to mingle with patrons - a real plus. FOODThe antipasti di salumi is tasty and high quality. The real queen is the BISTECCA FIORENTINA. Wagyu from Australia, tasty and tender perfectly grilled Medium Rear to Rear. It's enough to share although you may want it all for yourself. I recommend it and will return. CIA

This is the best steak we ever eaten. 6 of us went for my father in laws' 70th birthday as it is his favourite food. I went to great lengths to track down the best reviewed steak house in Singapore for him. We had quite a feast with quite a few polished off bottles of wine and a few digestives like you do. And all came out the merrier which helped digest the bill at $900. Worth every penny. Ive eaten in some mediocre lunch restaurants in London for a similar price tag per head so was reasonably happy. Although I think my FIL felt guilty for the amount of red wine washed down and in his piddled state insisted he pickup the tab lol!! Oh well..
4
My husband and young adults boys enjoyed the steak - both the Costata and Florentine. Daughter enjoyed the risotto, younger son enjoyed the pork chop. Excellent service... came here to celebrate my boys' birthdays and they were served each a Tiramisu, complimentary. Very nice surprise! Not to mention the staff who collected the birthday cake on our behalf from The Patissier.

1) Bone in Ribeye was unavailable We had the Bone in Sirloin, Rump & 45 days aged RibeyeAll were tender but everything came overly salted.Somehow we were unable to taste the nice nutty flavour of the beef hence it was quite a disappointing meal.
4
We had a wonderful meal here - two courses each and wine
Food was excellent as was the wine
Only let down by having to order sides with the main - just a lump of meat - nothing additional
5
Still one of my favourite places for steak, amazing grill and made just to the right doneness and chargrilled texture. Great place for friends or business.
3
I have had great meals here at dinner time but the set lunch was disappointing. Rib eye was chewy and not well seasoned. But the service was as usual very good.
5
i had the pleasure of having a good meal at bistecca with my family. The meat was prime and fresh, giving a very straightforward flavour that shook me to my core as i could taste the effort and man hours that was put into the dishes. What impressed me most however, was the amazing wait staff there. The team was friendly, warm and welcoming, and gave us an amazing experience. The waitstaff and stellar food left a great impression on me, and thus i am writing this review as they deserve at least this much from me from the effort they put into giving us an amazing time at bistecca. All the waitstaff, as well as the chefs, thank you for the experience. Great food. Great atmosphere. Amazing people.

If you're into meat, and I'm talking very good meat, then Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse should have an entry in your contacts. It's a little hidden and unfortunately not wheelchair accessible but once you're inside and have the excellent food in front of you all is forgotten.Very good choice of Wagyu beef, excellent service and if there is anything to criticize it has to do with the dim lighting. You need the flashlight of your mobile to read the menu

We decided to try this place after searching around and reading some reviews. We wanted to try the Bistecca Alla Flotentina very much as we have tried something similar in Hong Kong and we totally love the one in HK. We reached there much earlier than our reservation time and were given a table beside the kitchen, which was very hot because of the flame (we were only separated by the glass). Hence, requested for a change in table.The second table given was so much better, situation inside with the rest of the diners. This restaurant have an extensive wine list. Wanted to try the burrata but since it comes with purple cabage and they couldn't acommodate to change to rockets, we decided to try the Octopus (Polipo). Quite nice. The portion is definitely not for sharing. We were contemplating if we should ordered another starters but decided not to so that we can save our stomach space for the steak.The steak was recommended to be cooked medium rare, however we changed it to medium. It was very nicely done. Charred at its surface. We managed to finish the entire T-bone and even had desert. Since this was a birthday dinner, we were given a complimentary tiramisu. We ordered semi-fredo poached pear. Not the best desert, but it was not too bad. the pear wasn't too sweet. The waiter and waitress were all friendly. Ambience wise, a bit too bright on the lighting. It's more like a casual dining as well.If you have not visited this restaurant, do give it a tr

I took my family to the restarant based on reviews on the internet. I base my rating on the following three issues:1. The food did not arrive at the same time, one dish arrived about ten minutes before the others.2. The steak I ordered was cold on arrival, the reason given was that it had to rest, but resting a steak untill room temperature is not the way to do it. I was given a new staek which was at teh righ temperature but way to much salt.3. Slow service, we visited on a Sunday afternoon at lunch and there was only one waiter in the area we were seated which mught have been the main cause that the 1st steak was cols because it was standing waiting for the service
4
We went to Bistecca for our New Year's Eve dinner with our 2 children. The ambiance was nice and cozy. The service was top notch. Everyone from the reception to the dining area was attentive. The server even provided a purse holder. The food was very good. The steaks were done well. I also enjoyed their wine
2
They had run out of tenderloin on what is quite a small menu, so I was persuaded to have sirloin. It was no good, I sent it back and eventually they came with some slices of some sort of meat which was ok, but not soft tenderloin. Surprisingly we were still charged for my meal
5
Dinner with friends over the CNY weekend. The bar area has a great selection of well made cocktails and definitely worth having a pre or post drink. The restaurant is beautifully lit with wonderful art showing what's on the menu in its living breathing state It is clearly all about the meat here with a kitchen where you can see the food being prepared and fridges where you can see the meat and the meat is stunning. A proper Char grill in the kitchen, well sourced and prepared and fantastic sides that tell you that you are in Tuscany. Fantastic wine list with options for all. Pricey- yes but worth every cent. My only observation? Folks, make your own chips, buying in frozen chips doesn't do everything else on the menu the justice it truly deserves.
5
Bistecca had always been my benchmark for steak quality, cooking style and taste. Perfect texture with the right amount juiciness. The rib eye was our personal favorite!!
4
Food and service are great. Location a little hard to find although is along the road. Not wheelchair and stroller friendly.
5
The steak was perfect. The rabbit pasta was divine. And the service was excellent. Not my first time there. And definitely not my last.
4
Italian cousins, nice wine selection, nice services. Ambience was also no bad... Price were a bit on the higher....
5
An incredible experience. Bistecca food and service was phenomenal! A great evening celebrating our sons 18th birthday!
4
Nice steaks but quite expensive! It Singapore either way... Attentive service with nice attitude! Would definitely recommend for good steak!
5
Awesome food, great service staff. Price is of course high but worth it for special days. Steaks are wonderful but appetiser quality is also a top notch
3
We went to Bistecca few weeks ago. We ordered the burrata cheese with tomatoes and Tuscan steak. I like the burrata cheese very much because it is freshly made. It went very good with the tomatoes. The steak however contains too much fatty tissue when served. So we had to cut the fat away from the meat before we can enjoy the steak. Later after we finished the steak, we had half of the plate covered with the fat and they looked quite disgusting on the plate. If we ever go back to the steakhouse again, I would definitely go for the steak with less fat
5
I went there for my anniversary dinner at the time, and though I didn't tell the staff, they gave me the best service.The service staff kindly held my reservation when I called in and said I'd be a bit late, when I arrived and my partner wanted to change our seat, they kindly accommodated even though I told them it wasn't necessary.The waiter was very attentive and very well informed about both the food and the wine menus, able to give me a good breakdown of what they served with what, why it was done that way, and what was what size and even gave personal recommendations.The wine he selected was exactly what I was looking for, he was able to advise on very good medium bodied reds to go with the steak I ordered.The Tartare and the 500gm steak are worth coming back for again and again. It is done precisely as you ask for it and comes with a proper array of mustards and even a most delightful red wine reduction sauce.The wines are expensive and will make up the bulk of your cost. But they are good. It all feels very italian. The variety is vast, and their wine expert will even help you pick out private recommendations not on the menu, which he did for us as well and found us a very lovely desert wine for after dinner.The pasta didn't impress me unfortunately, but it is a steak house, so no surprise.The desserts were alright, above average, but not outstanding.So the service, the starters, the steaks and the wine.You want to wine and dine? Here's the place
4
We had the sirloin and it was excellent. The Buratta is also good as compared with another Italian Restaurant that I have eaten not too long back. Service was good as well. The waiting staff were attentive and accommodated me asking for something not on the menu
5
Best steak that I have had so far. Pricey but worth the price. Excellent service despite the crowd. Would definitely be up a notch if it is possible to keep the steak warm throughout the meal.
2
Going there is merely for the ambience. The quality of food is really average whereby you could get better quality of food for the same price else whwes
4
Great food. We loved the octopus starter. The mains were just as good. Service was slightly forgetful of our order but were quick to apologise and quickly sorted things out.
4
Had dinner with some friends here. Food was pretty good and loves the sharing meat platter! Had the t bone and bone on ribeye! Nicely done!! Will be back again
5
Nice food and place for dining for any occasion. will visit more often and will recommend more people
5
Our favourite flame grilled steak place closed a while ago and we have been looking for a new restaurant to get our steak fix.We were impressed with the service and the quality of the food. We shared several dishes starting with an antipasta, then pasta, then the main, and dessert. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The wine list is quite extensive with good wines in the moderate price range and up. We will definitely make this a regular restaurant.
5
Went for dinner last evening. Wonderful t-bone rib eye.. Really tasty on its own. Had oysters as starters. Crispy and fresh. The cheese plate for dessert came with a good variety of cheese type that you don't typically get in most restaurants in town.Only draw back wa

Our family of four had dinner at Bistecca, also called the "Tuscan Steakhouse". We were keen on having steaks but the prices of the steak (mostly Wagyu beef) were just prohibitively high. Looking at the small print on the menu the Wagyu beef was actually a cross Holstein/Wagyu variety but this did not seem to dampen the high prices! We ended up eating other dishes such as roasted spring chicken and these were generally very good
5
Took the family here for a celebration, and we had a superb night, the food was excellent, the fresh Mozzerella and tomato was unbelievable as a starter, and then when we the steaks arrived we were all blown away by the quality and the presentation. My son and his fiancÃ©' stand it was the best meat restaurant they had been to in Singapore, high praise indeed. the wine list is very good, and priced ok consider it is Singapore
3
I was told by the waiter taking our orders that we cannot share the set lunch. When we enquired with the manager, she said it is because the portions are small and they are afraid that the patrons may not have enough to eat. Surely we can decide for ourselves whether we have enough to eat
5
great choice of meat, real tuscan taste. everything was as i tried in Italy. So nice that i found this place. better to book table.
4
Order 1.1kg beef steak for sharing among 4 people. Meat was tender and soft. Service and atmosphere is pretty good too.
5
Food was delicious and service, prompt. Overall doneness of the beef was to our liking. We were uncertain of the wine to pair with our beef and had a wonderful sommelier to introduce us to some choices. Good job!
5
Burrata was awesome... simply the best ! Atmosphere is very conducive for small group chats. All dishes were very well prepared, including the steak, squid ink spaggetti, tiramisu (!!)
4
This was our second visit to the restaurant. We pre-ordered the bone in rib eye which was worth it. The truffle risotto, squid ink pasta, pork chop was good. Service was excellent, and they offer one for one if you order wine and bring a bottle.
4
I have been to Bistecca a couple of times, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal each time. The steaks and pasta are excellent, and they also have a very large wine line as well as other drink choices. Service is generally very good, although on my last visit their was a big mix up with our order, but it was quickly fixed.The only drawback is the price. Don't expect to pay less than $150 per head if having starter, mains and wine
5
This is the second time that I have come here. The Bistecca alla Florentina for sharing is just fantastic, done just perfectly (medium rare) and very well seasoned. This is accompanied by a lovely Amarone, the fruity flavour just complementing the beef. It was such a great meal!The burrata was so creamy, and was perfect with the wonderfully sweet tomatoes. The creamed spinach was also very well done. I am looking forward to coming back to try other cuts
4
My husband surprised me with this wonderful meal to celebrate our wedding night and birthday and the staff accommodated us very well. There was champagne to accompany our celebration and even helped my husband to arrange beautiful flowers. Ambiance was great as it was quiet and of the right lighting. Food was delicious. We had the Wagyu Ribeye for sharing (2-3) pax but we could hardly finish it. It was flavourful and tender. Though some parts were slightly undercooked, they would gladly bring it back it to make it right for you again. We noticed that the meat was cooked over charcoal which explained the nice aroma on the meat. We had to wait for the meat as it took awhile to cook but they served as fresh bread and pate while we waited. We finished off with a tiramisu and tea which just put the cherry on top of the cake. We will definitely be back
2
This used to be one of our favorite places for dinner. I requested to go for my birthday, and dreamed of the mushroom risotto and dessert. Risotto was good, but the Tuscan fries my husband ordered turned out to be oven chips with herbs. For $18. Sorry, you lost us. Plenty more places to try in future, disappointing.
4
I booked the restaurant under the recommendation of my cousin. There were 11 of us, thus I ordered 2 different sharing waygu steaks. They are excellent, cooked to medium...The meat was tender and flavourful. For antipasti, I would recommend the octopus and prawns. However, the squid ink pasta was disappointing. It was nothing extraordinary, so I would not order it again. But, the oxtail and rabbit/foie gras pasta is worth ordering.The service staff are very attentive. But, unwittingly, I was charged $80 for still water, when asked between sparkling or still..Maybe I should have just asked for tap water...I saw the next table drinking water from a jug. Anyway, lesson learnt
5
It's a good experience of dining here. Very good food. Nice ambiance. Definitely worth your money. Will go back for sure!
5
a perfect visit in terms of food , ambience and service. just a little pricey so cant visit too often
4
I've eaten steak at dozens of restaurants in Singapore and this is simply the best, buy it is quite expensive. Great service, starters, sides and wine list as well. If dining during peak dinner hours book in advance as it is often full.
4
The oysters we had for starter were fresh and the steak was perfectly done. As my partner said, this is better than some of the well known steak places!
5
Food here is great--- service likewise is very vey good. Prices are very steep and clearly biggest possible downside-- but compensated be extraordinary food
4
The steak was very well grilled and service was good.
Good recommendation from the server as well.
The only improvement needed was that some of the staff are not able to explain the menu as well and have to refer to other seniors..
5
Excellent steak house in Singapore with superb service. The sharing plate are very nice and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is nice and cosy with some nice arts at the wall which fits perfectly with the theme.
We went there even twice...
5
The BISTECCA ALLA FIORENTINA was one of the best steaks ever! Char was perfect, seasoning may have seemed salty on the crust, but it worked as it was a really juicy thick cut.
5
Pleasant dinner. Ordered steak. Unfortunately one of the steak was not cook to request however wait staff provide fast service recovery. Would recommend this place for dinner date.
5
I wanted to have a birthday dinner with my family at a steakhouse and after reading through various reviews, finally decided on Bistecca Tuscan. I booked the restaurant early through an app to ensure that I could get a good table. In my booking, I mentioned that I was going to celebrate my birthday with the family and requested for a good table. The restaurant clearly took note and arranged for a corner table. I was also pleasantly surprised that when we turned up, they appeared to have made it a point to note that it was a birthday celebration. The waiter who attended to us was very friendly and knowledgeable. Before we went there, I had already looked through the menu on their website and decided on what I thought would be the best. However, after the waiter (whose name I regrettably forgot to find out) explained to us the items on the menu, I realised that what I decided earlier might not exactly have been what I would like to have and I changed my order based on his explanation. Our food turned out to be fantastic. I went with very high expectations based on the glowing reviews that I read and I was definitely not disappointed. Even though the total bill is not cheap, it is worth every single cent of it. It is definitely a place that I would return to
4
Overall experience is very good. Except main course took a while to be served.
Excellent service, especially a Chinese guy who attended my requests very promptly.
5
Food to die for. Wine well recommended , loved the dessert cocktails as well. We had an expensive night but well worth it.
5
Great restaurant with amazing steaks!! Perfect for what we were looking for. The staff were attentive.
5
Had a late diner with friends on Friday night, the food and wine were gorgeous! We were looked after by all the staff too. Thank you Bistecca for a wonderful evening, can't wait to come back.

Heard several great reviews from friends and decided to try them out on a special occasion. We went for the signature dish which was the sharing steak "Florentino". It wasn't bad per se but I guess the serving size was just too big until it was a "meat overdose" kinda feeling for us at the end. The entire piece of T-bone steak is around 1.1kg and the meat itself about 800gm. Unless you are extremely hungry, you are better off going for the tenderloin which was calling out to us from the next table. Lol. The service staff were very friendly. The only grief we had was that the steak knives were not sharp and we had to use a lot of strength trying to cut the meat. A change of knives did not help at all. Time to sharpen those steak knives! We will certainly be back again to try out other items on the menu (but will give the sharing steak a miss for sure the next time).
1
This is our 7th visit to the restaurant and we were superbly disappointed with Bistecca. Not sure if they had a change of management but the new staff kept interrupting our conversations throughout the night.They repeatedly pestered us to top up the already filled to the brim. The waiter who took our orders was unprofessional. He says he has nothing to recommend from the menu and would only tell us what he likes to eat (?!). Overall a terrible experience though food remains good. Would not go back there again given the bad servic
5
This restaurant doesn't look much from the outside however it is a STUNNING place to eat! We had a 1.3kg T Bone between 4 of us, along with a few sides. Oh, and starters so good we had them twice! Octopus and oysters were phenomenal!! Highly recommend this great restaurant with equally great service
4
My love for a nice steak led my hubby to make a reservation at this steakhouse for our 15th anniversary! We had our honeymoon in Italy and this definitely brought back fond memories! As the steak was a huge portion, we ordered the Costata to share with asparagus on the side without any appetizers. Of course, with a nice bottle of Roccolo Grassi recommended by the staff. As we were seated right next to the kitchen where we could see the action, we noticed that a piece of our steak fell on the ground when the chef was cutting it. I thought that at least the chef could do was to apologize but he didn't and the waiter just gave me a grin I mentioned if the chef did so. A little unprofessional I would say for such an establishment. They could have handled it a little better. The steak was done nicely for medium. However, it turned cold pretty fast so I am just thinking if they could have it served in some kind of warmer in future.For a Wednesday night, I would say that they may be a little short-handed that we have to actually signal to the waiters several times for our glasses to be refilled with our wine.We did end off with tiramisu (for any Italian restaurant) and it was fantastic! I would return and I am hoping that there would be improvement in their service then.
5
Listen this place is just the best you can get. It's menu is simple and luxurious. Steak cook Italian style over hard wood grill. Spectacular Burrata and a salumi platter that is perfect for two. The Italian wines are lovely and well balanced. I don't know who the Italian guy who runs the front of the house is but he kills it and really is the authenticity this place needs. Burrata Burrata Burrata.
5
2.2kg of perfectly cooked Bistecca alla Fiorentina for 3 adults and 2 kids! And we still didn't have enough! For once, the kids totally ignored the potato wedges. The beef melts in your mouth. 6+ marbling. The charred fat is the truly the best part. The burrata is highly recommended too. The tomatoes are very sweet. Top class!
5
Great atmosphere amazing high class service. all dishes were amazing. The Japanese steak was out if this world, probably one of the best we ate. prices are high but worth it.
5
The best steak I have ever tried. Wonderful service provided by professional staff. Considerate and patient.
4
Ordered the set lunch on my visit and i think it is very good value for the quality of food and service.
5
We ordered the steak for 2 persons. As we are a small eater, we ordered the smallest portion of 550g. The steak was beautifully cooked as we ordered, which is well done, but we could still taste the juicyness of the beef. We also ordered an entree of scallop which is so fresh and juicy. The steak is quite pricy but its worth it
5
I was at the restaurant for a celebration, and i went early to deposit a cake. The team was really nice, professional, and friendly when i asked if could leave the cake at the restaurant. They readily accepted my request and reassured me that they would take good care of it. I left the restaurant with smiles and i did not have to worry about the cake melting under the hot sun. When i was done with dinner, they cleared the table and served the cake without me prompting them. It was a really nice gesture. Feeling really welcomed and happy with the service, i left half the cake for the staff team to enjoy. They were surprised at my gesture and i guess it was a win-win situation for both. Good job
4
Two of us went to Sunday lunch knowing it would be a monumental meal. We ordered very simply: the Wagyu ribeye plus one side dish of creamed spinach. The vege came late but we forgave the mess up. The steak was great. It's $$$ but well worth it.
5
The wagyu bone-in rib eye - Bistecca Alla Costata is done to perfection EVERYTIME.Full flavoured, succulent, melt in the mouth with smoky aroma on the charred crust,finished the right amount of salt.The only place to go when you crave for the best steak
5
Loved our visit here (: celebrated my father's birthday here and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. They helped us store our cake and even helped to cut it. Our dishes were very good and portions are above average. Their steak is amazing (
5
I tried Bistecca for the first time last Saturday with six people for a business dinner with partners in tow. Bottom line, I had a good experience. Food was excellent in particular the sharing steak which we shared three of between six of us. Service was also very good. My guests all commented on how good the restaurant was that evening and the next day and this will now be a go to restaurant for future events
5
I went to this steakhouse after two failed attempts at finding a good steak. I had their rib eye and it knocked my socks off. It was perfectly seared and seasoned, as i'm writing this right now my mouth is filling up with drool. Definitely taking my family there the next time I visi
5
I went to this steakhouse with my wife who is a vegetarian. Super thrilled to find excellent vegetarian food here. Wine list perfect and the steaks here are just mouthwatering. Loved the service here. Super professional and friendly.
5
We started off with a risotto with truffle, tagliatelle, and salumi. I highly recommend the risotto with truffle. The bone-in rib eye and rib eye was tender and juicy.
5
Everything excellent. Value for money. Great place. Only comment is the airconditioning which is a bit warm.
4
Team dinner. Ordered Costada to share and 2 bottles of Carpineto Farnito Cabernet Sauvignon 2010. Steak was nicely grilled and the wine was very good value.
5
The t-bone steak was well cooked and delicious. The Florentine steak portion was good for sharing with nice ambiance to relax and have a nice dinner.
4
Have been to this place 3-4 times now, I can safely say that this is one of the best places in Singapore for steak. The 1.2 kg T-bone is a great option for sharing and its great value for money. The side dishes like broccoli are excellent as well. Wine is the only thing which pushes the bill to an exorbitant level.Overall, still a great experience!
5
Our group of 5 enjoyed a superb meal at Bistecca. The atmosphere is intimate and feels exclusive, but still welcoming. We ordered a variety of sides, a grass-fed tenderloin, and huge ribeye steak. Both steaks had a perfectly beautiful tender texture and juicy taste. Service was top notch for Singapore -- staff were attentive and accommodating. The meal was memorable and I will be returning
4
Lovely restaurant along Mohd Sultan with excellent steak and Italian cuisine. For appetisers, we loved the scallops, prawns and rocket salad. We took both the steaks they had for sharing - Wagyu rib-eye and Wagyu T-bone. Both were excellent though I preferred the rib-eye which seemed more tender. The sides were super - creamed spinach, cherry tomatoes, brocolini and Tuscan fries. We had squid ink pasta and rabbit tortellini - Both recommended. Tiramisu did not disappoint so leave some space for dessert. This is a cosy and comfortable restaurant with the nicest restrooms. Would have been 5 star except the service was somewhat slow despite the restaurant being almost empty.
4
Had a team dinner for 6 on a Friday night.We ordered most of the appetizers (no oyster as they were not delivered that day), both the Costada and the Fiorentina steaks (medium rare) to share, and all of the side vegetable dishes. 2 rounds of cocktails and 2 bottles of the Carpineto Farnito Cabernet Sauvignon Toscana IGT 2010.No issues from the staff on the noise as we were pretty noisy, lots of table space for the amount of food we ordered. Food was very good, steak was a little too red for medium rare but had good char. Burata was outstanding. Cocktails were ok but the wine was very good value for money.This is my go-to place for steaks prepared the Italian way.
5
Had a business dinner here recently. Ordered the Costata Rib-eye to share for 3 guys with a few sides and the Wagyu Tartare to start. Would have liked an additional 200-300g (basically the full 1.1kg without bone) to have made it more perfect, but can't fault the restaurant, we full well knew what we were going to get. For 2, it would have been perfect (with less sides). That said, the meat was impeccable. It was better than I can remember. The asparagus was nice, but the same can't be said for the creamed spinach. On the negatives, I'd say their wines are very highly priced. They're good wine, but in the end with the food itself already pretty expensively priced, the dinner would not come to less than $180/pax with a decent bottle
4
The steaks here are amazing. Truly delicious. I love how friendly and knowledgeable the service staff is.
4
We ordered costata for sharing and it was great. Went there for a birthday celebration and was given a tiramisu cake. It was such a pleasant surprise.
5
Had a private space for party of 10. Wait staff were always helpful and keeping our glasses filled. Great recommendations for wine. The burrata and the signature Tbone wagyu were amazing. Geat place for a nice night out. Love this place!
5
We had the sharing steaks (rib eye) and it was really really good. The pasta and risotto were very good as well. Definitely worth the money!

My friend and I decided to go for 1.1 kg T-bone wagyu steak for the main course, so we ordered just salad to share followed by the main course.I think it was one of the best T-bone steak I have ever had.On top the service and the atmosphere were also nice though it was almost packed due to Friday evening.Sure to return there!
4
Great steak (tenderloin) with decent wine suggestions from the wait staff. The sides (patata and spinach) were lovely and a great side to the steak. We had octopus to share as our starter which was a bit tough but delicious nonetheless.The only reason I didn't give this place 5/5 is because of the service. I was seated at 7:15 (waiting for my husband) only to be asked by the waiter 15 mins later if I'd made a reservation or if I had just sat down at a random table (which seemed odd). We were advised 10 mins later that there were scheduled seatings and we'd need to return the table in 30 minutes time but nothing about 'seating times' had been mentioned to us at the time of booking. FYI - their seatings are 6pm-8pm and 8pm-late. Overall, I enjoyed the meal here but was disappointed with the service
4
Relatively expensive, but a perfect steak. The steak was really tender and juicy, with no fat strips in! Medium raw, was really nice with red meet in the center, and with a nice crust on the outside. The potato was nicely made in an iron pan with cream, very delicious. The set of four different sausages /gravies were very nice made
5
We ordered the BISTECCA ALLA FIORENTINA - their Signature Wagyu T-bone steak, Asparagus and Burrata (Cheese). Oh my God! They were all to die for. Beef simply melts in your mouth, cooked & seasoned perfectly. The waiters are very attentive and friendly. Ambiance is very cozy and romantic. Good for those who wants to impress both the heart and stomach of your dates. No regrets even though it's pricey
5
My wife and I come here sometimes for special occasions. Christmas, anniversary, birthday. They do an excellent job of taking a special event just a little bit further. The sharing steaks are a must. La Fiorentina or la Costata. We've had both and you cannot go wrong. The chef does an excellent job of getting it perfectly medium rare. They serve it with four side sauces, but honestly these as unnecessary and would only detract from the quality of the steak. The appetizers and side dishes are also all really excellent. The grilled octopus and the broccoli rabe are two that stand out. But I have yet to try something here that was anything but excellent. The wine selection is broad and features a lot of different regions of Italy. It's particularly nice to see less well known varieties like Cannonau.The atmosphere inside is great. The massive hung paintings are all worth checking out. I cannot really describe. But I think one can see an example on line. But in person it's a different experience. And worthwhile. To be sure, the steaks are not cheap. But the quality of the meat and the care of the chef, which amount to a really excellent meal, are worth every cent.
5
Heard a lot of raves about this steakhouse. Decided to pull my partner here to try. Definitely did not regret a single bit. We did not order the usual favourite: T-bone florentina as we are unsure whether can we finish everything. We ordered Ribeye (Medium) & Tenderloin (Medium-well). It was jaw-dropping good! Do note that it does not come with any sides. There are only some onions and one leek. It also comes with 4 sauces: wasabi, mustard, veg sauce and vinegarish sauce.They also served bread before the mains were here. Their still water cost us $10. Overall, can visit again!
5
So juicy and succulent piece of meat!! It just melt in the mouth!! I can still taste the meat in my mouth right now. Excellent chef n the crew of Bistecca Tuscan. I will be back again.
3
Went on father's day and the food took way longer than usual and the staff were slow to refill drinks and even forgot one of our orders.
5
Just the most amazing meat I have ever tasted- the kind that melts in your mouth! Certainly better than the ultra expensive US steakhouse chain restaurants! Highly recommend.
5
few times for dinner, the staff so friendly a good service and nice atmosphere, definitely will come back again
5
This is my go-to spot for business dinners. They never fail in delivering a great meal. Love the Fiorentina steak!
5
This a great find. It's a smallish place but the service is great and the food is even better. It's expensive but you get what you pay for. They have good wines to go along with the food as well.
4
One of the best steaks I have tasted so far in Singapore. I would recommend trying it without any condiments for the first slice, you will be able to experience the nicely charred edges and the salt rub marinate.
5
excellent good, nice wine, good people, amazing experience, it will be great if can arrange a table inside for us
3
The peraon who recommended the wine and served us did not smile at all. Also they forgot what I requested for the occasion. The signature steak florentine though is very good.
4
I was randomly walking when I happened past Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse at 5.30[m. I was feeling a little hungry as I had skipped lunch so popped in to enquire what time they would be starting dinner service.I was told 6pm so came back then. I ordered the 300g rib eye and a side of creamed spinach.Steak was cooked perfectly (I asked for rare) if a touch to much salt seasoning. Nonetheless, I polished off the steak quickly followed by the creamed spinach.It's a cosy little restaurant and the staff are very friendly and helpful
5
Have been here many times and loved every meal. Great wine choice and the food never disappoints. The ham wrapped prawns with fennel salad for an appetiser are sublime.
5
We visit Bistecca every time we visit Singapore, Steak is always cooked to perfection. Lovely atmosphere, Service is 1st class
4
we go to Bistecca regularly and are always impressed with the steaks here. The non steak dishes like the pumpkin ravioli are also good. Service is also good from our experience.
4
We went there last night with Clients and had a great time. The Bistecca we ordered was very good and the price worth. Side dishes a bit small but good. Service are remarkable and defenetely better than in other italien Restaurants in Singapore.Worth a visit
5
We totally enjoyed our meal. The service was good and food was great. Will return if I want to have a good steak. We also enjoyed the squid ink pasta with crab meat and their panna cotta and tiramisu were excellent. Not a cheap place by any standard but well worth it for the food.
3
We went there for a special dinner and we were sat essentially in the walkway from the middle of the restaurant to the back. This was no the best but we put up with it until a large group of 20+ people came in to this area of the restaurant and proceeded to walk and bump as as they went by and talk quite loudly to each other.The food was fine but nothing special and the portions on the small size. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere but was ruined by the bad placement of large groups. The front of the restaurant also had a group which could have been placed at the back with the others so normal diners could have sat in a quieter environment together at the front.Service was good but unfortunately the average food and extreme noise ruined the night and I doubt I will return given there are plenty of other good options nearby that offer better value
4
We booked as a birthday surprise for my duaghter. Although there was a mixup with the booking it more than compensated with numerous free drinks throughout the night. The food was great, especially as two of us shared the 1.2 kg steak. which was superbly cooked. We had a wonderful nigh
5
Celebrated my son's recent Birthday dinner here last week on Mother's Day. We had a table out front which was rather pleasant, not too hot. We ordered 3 appetisers. Started with Rucola Prosciutto salad, then Polipo which was pan roasted octopus, followed by Tortellini di Angelo ie lamb and mint tortellini with cheese.For main, our table of 3 shared the Costata, their signature bone-in F1 Wagyu rib eye, cooked Tuscan style. It was juicy, flavourful and tender. Just simply awesome and perfect with the grilled asparagus we ordered.The manager was kind to organise a complimentary slice of tiramisu with candle when I mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We added on a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a panna cotta for desert, coffee and a glass of prosecco. Service was impeccable. We absolutely enjoyed every morsel of food served and happily gave away $380 when the bill came.

Wah I tell you ah, I went to Bistecca for bachelor party. First, the atmosphere damn posh one, like macam 10 star restaurant. I open the menu i see the price I thought WAH piang so ex, but actually the size to quality to price ratio very worth it. Your wallet pain pain but the tummy Super happy one.I very like it when the staff is able to tell me which wine is good, worth it for 10 of us big men. At first we ordered one bottle, he bring this bottle so small, he look at our table all the big size guys, then he damn PAISEH, recommended the magnum size Chianti. Best decision ever.For steaks, we ordered the Costata and Fiorentina sharing platters. Wah Lau eh sibei shiok leh I almost died. Melty, juicy, orgasmic. Very very worth it. In the end I think we spent 120 per pax... Not bad Leh. My only suggestion is don't waste time on the pasta. We ordered the seafood one, you eat one mouth then you kena the steak I confirm you damn sad one. The buratta cheese damn delicious also cannot describe. But big portion... And 40 bucks. In your head you can hear your Wife nagging at you liao.We were quite noisy also then one of the staff came to politely tell us to quieted down cos these two charbor nearby not happy, but we don't care then. But the staff handled that well, so we also PAISEH stopped laughing so loud. Thank you thank you to all the people at bistecca! Keep it up!! 10 starrrrrrrrrr!!

...It is not often I use those two words in a sentence. I dared the boyfie below in his review to mention how he took his 'lover' to Bistecca, but he refused to use the operative word, and opted for the boring 'we' instead. That is by-the-by and of no relevance to the delicious steak and top-notch service this place to offer. I digress.Don't know why people tsk-tsked at the facade on a few reviews, but its a beautifully charming place that does bomb steaks. Loved the interior of the place.Melt in your mouth anyone? Need not fear as there will be no incessant chewing to get through your delicious steak. We had the baked potato (not your traditional but way better), creamed spinach (hell yes), and funghi with gnocchi (was a bit bland to me) as starters. Word-up to Zul for being an amazing server, and has left a lasting impression upon me and my 'lover' of what amazing customer service should be like. Truth is yes, it is expensive. Yes, it may cause a dent in your wallet, maybe you might cry a little, but YES it is worth it and you will be glad you did it.Kudos to the Aesop products and endless supply of sanitary napkins in the ladies bathroom should a women need that extra protection. I like to have options, and I like how Bistecca Tuscan gets that

Food were great! People and service were great too! This is my 2nd visit within a year. Will definitely visit again for the great service and food.
4
Great food. You won't be disappointed the quality of the food is excellent, the steak is very good. Had a lovely meal with friends here.
Wine list is also very good
5
The entrance wasn't very pleasant because there is some construction going on next door. But once you are in the ambience is great.
Service was AMAZING!
4
Great food. Location is easy to find. I was there early, didn't find any problem to park along roadside.
5
This place serves quality food and steak.
We totally enjoyed the meal here. The beef was of excellent quality and cooked to perfection. Thumbs up!
5
We had a wonderful meal and overall experience at Bistecca. Service was excellent (a lovely chap named Zul waited our table), ambience and decor very cool and contemporary, and of course the food was exceptional. We ordered a rib-eye to share, funghi gnochhi, baked potato and creamed spinach - more than enough for two people. We will definitely be coming back, despite the fact that it is rather expensive
4
We ordered a Filleto and Pumpkin ravioli each for dinner. They were both very delicious. The Filleto was cooked exactly medium rare as requested and was seasoned well. It came with four types of sauces - mustard, Dijon mustard, a herb mixture, and a balsamic reduction. I think the steak went very well with the balsamic reduction. We would have preferred a potato mash to or some greens to go along with the steak though. The ravioli came with creamy pumpkin filling and a butter sauce, which was rich and slightly sweet. Though the portion was not big, it was filling. It was unfortunately slightly too oily for my liking. Service was prompt and staff were polite and friendly. We may return again on a special occasion as prices are too steep for an average weekly fare.
5
Whether it's business or with family and friends, I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the food (amazing cuts of meat) and service here. Yes, it's expensive (but not as expensive as other known and popular steakhouses in Singapore like C** or M*****s). It's an intimate restaurant (with both indoor and outside seating) and the service is top notch and very personalized. They have a great selection of lovely wine too. The chef cooks every steak to perfection - we have never, ever been unhappy. The sides (creamed spinach, mushrooms, asparagus, fries and more) are all delicious. I love the complimentary glass of limoncello after each meal. If you want to try something in a cool neighborhood away from the CBD or other popular eating destination, I highly recommend that you try Bistecca
5
The staff were welcoming, accommodating and friendly. Its not the cheapest but the quality is good and the restaurant has a great atmosphere - good for a special occasion. My husband even got a candle to celebrate his birthday in his tiramisu :) A great find. Thank you
5
My daughter gave me a gift voucher to the Bistecca for my birthday. The food and service was absolutely great, but the prices were a little numbing e.g. $70 to $200 for a steak, cheapest bottle of wine around $95. Luckily my voucher covered most of the expense, and we had a fantastic night
5
Lovely atmosphere, good service and great wine list and food. Pasta was top notch and Wagyu steaks were tasty and cooked to perfection. Rather expensive but this is Singapore.
5
One of the best steakhouses I've been to in my quest for the perfect beef. The chef really delivers it spot on here. Had a wonderful time with the family and definitely will be back with friends again. Great ambience and excellent service.
5
We started with a small plate for the 4 of us with all kind excellent tasting slices ham, sausages, etc. And side dish of soft cheese. Main course was signature Wagyu F1 t-bone. we enjoyed this with the 4 of us. And the real Italian Tiramisu was a excellent dessert which made the evening complet
1
We book for a table 2 weeks ago for 7 pax for dinner, and we have received a call at noon today informing us that they have to reallocate us to an outdoor seating place because some other bigger group had make a booking indoor and there is no space to accommodate us.We are currently facing a heatwave in SG, with temperature spiking around 35 deg C. Imagine having a chargrilled steak and red wine outdoor under that weather! Eventually we decided to book another restaurant elsewhere as I don't think we should be deserved to be treated this way.It's a pity to see such good reviews, but service to me is number 1 no matter how good your food is. Good luck to you Bistecca Tuscan!
1
Beautiful settingPoor services Highly overpriced Steak was cooked not grilled as the Italian's do wIth olive oilNot worth it
3
This Italian steakhouse is consistently ranked one of the best steakhouses in Singapore by the food blogs and food sites. first, its service score A as we were well received and well taken care of throughout the meal. Staff were professional, polished and friendly. Ambient was rustic and comfortable. Our starters and pasta were quite good. however, our most anticipated 1.1kg Fiorentina Signature Wagyu F1 t-bone was a complete disappointment! It had so much tendon and thick layer of fat that was not eatable at all (see picture). That piece of uneatable meat cost S$188. We left with disbelief
5
Was reading some reviews of great steak place in Singapore and decided to give a try...the staffs were helpful and attentive. The steak portion is generous, the steak was really juicy and perfectly executed. ..moist inside...juicy and so delicious. It is not cheap but totally worth it! Suitable for special occasions. .
4
The best thing about this restaurant is the range of Italian wines which they have, the Pasta and Steak which I had was above average, good for me and I enjoyed it. Service was good but could have been a lot more attentive than to have people looking around for waiter in the terrace. Warm, cosy ambience in the terrace, wonderful lit. I would also recommend this restaurant not only for dinner with clients, but for couples too. ( Request for terrace 
5
Great space, that opens up as you go back into the shop house. We were seated in the first narrower part of the restaurant, which was great as my son liked the flames from the open grill. Service was excellent, the waiters were all keeping my son amused. I didn't expect that when I entered the restaurant as it had the potential to be a bit stuffy going by how nice it was, and the level of diner. But great to see that wonderful service and food can be done in a happy friendly way that works for everyone whether with family or on a business meeting. Food was excellent... one has to say it should be steak, steak, steak all the way. Many a steak joint out there, but few have given me such a great meal as this. Definitely going back 
4
Bistecca manages to mix a classic steak house with superb Italian favourites.The tasting menu is excellent bar the dessert which was a disappointing effort. The lobster linguine however was superb as was the Wagyu steak.If you just want a superb steak and wine then they cater for this too. The wines are mainly Italian but a superb selection from all round the country.The service is a little scanty - wrong meals delivered to wrong people etc but overall a good spot, and close to Robertson Quay for pre/post drinks
5
Celebrated birthday there. Had really good tasty dishes, from appetizers to pasta and the steak (to be shared by 2 people) is the best. Prices are reasonable. If one wants degustation , then everyone at the table must also have the same.
4
Good steak restaurant - but worth shopping around: there are plenty of contenders in Singapore for this particular crown. Bit on the expensive side - I think there are one or two better options for the money.
4
Chose this restaurant for family dinner with great steaks. Restaurant was nice and full, food was very good, but not exceptional. Service was prrofessional and friendly. Got even small Birthday pudding...Pricelevel is very high and meybe this is more for business dinners than family occations
4
Fabulous Tuscan restaurant with incredible steacks directly from Italy. I was there with Italian friends and we all have been impressed by the quality of their meat, wines and pastry...close the eyes and you feel like being in a Tuscan restaurant in Italy...Waitairs are taking care of you perfectly well and nothing if left aside to ensure the meal will be a memorable one...bravo
4
For a good steak and wine selection - this is a good place to go. We wouldn't classify it as 'the best' - but then again it's all relative. We travel a lot, we're foodies and we come from a family of chefs and restaurateurs.The quality of the meat is very good and it's done nicely. The other side dishes are also well selected and prepared - like the scallops. The have a decent wine selection.The ambience of the place is nice, dark but not gloomy and tables well set apart.The service is good in terms of menu knowledge, friendliness and efficiency - but some of the staff lack detailed attention - for example, no napkin on the table and missing cutleries.Overall, it's a trusted place to go for a good meal. You won't get disappointed if you're inviting your guests to try it
4
I been for Christmas with my friend and we have a spectacular lunch. They have a lot of Italian wine that brought back home with the mind. Food spectacularly served and interiors funky. The fiorentina was spectacular well cocked and presented. I will bring my wife tonigh
4
One of the best steakhouse I have been. They offer a wide variety of Italian wine. On all the occasions I was there, I tried their Florentina steak made in a serving for 2. Quality is consistent and very well executed. You could see the chef do his magic over the aquarium-style kitchen built with see through glass. We start light with antipasti complimented by good wine. Will definitely return
4
We decided to try somewhere for dinner after deciding we need a beef fix, normally Luke's or Gordon Grill would be our destination.Bister a has a nice venue, with some character but the have put in a private dining room in the back of the restuarant which really doesn't blend and makes the rear of the place awkward somehow, but I am sure it's an easy fix to blend it in.The service was pretty good overall, the staff are attentive and there seems to be enough on duty to make dinner enjoyable, a big bonus in Singapore restaurants nowadays.For the food we had oysters, which were great and a sharing ribeye, which was very tasty, and just right for two people.Overall the experience was good, and will be trying it again, hopefully by then they have a couple of paintings hiding the private room :
5
Came here with the wife for our wedding anniversary and we were instantly greeted with a warm welcome from our host, Xenia!Didn't have to wait long for the food and the main highlight of the evening was definitely the signature wagyu F1 bone-in ribeye.We've eaten our fair share of quality steaks and this is definitely up there with the best. It was quite simply charred to perfection with the doneness spot on.The icing on the cake was the also excellent tiramisu to finish off the meal.We ended the great evening with complimentary drinks and a lovely conversation with Xenia who made the experience all the more intimate. Highly recommended!!!!
4
Came in for lunch and ordered the set lunch - salad-fresh pasta-steak set, skipped dessert. Lunch set menu comes with value instead of ordering your steaks ala carte. Glass wine menu was not impressive but the steak and the pasta were superb. I advise not going for lunch due to the SG humidity, grill glass kitchen is nearby dining seats, they don't full blast their AC during daytime, front doors are also wide-open
4
This is my second visit. We usually order burata, 1kg grill steak, cold cut platter and some fresh vegetables as side. Great wine list too, all good!
5
Not the cheapest, but one of the best foods I had in Singapore! Some extraordinary beef, superb octopus, great oysters and good wines. Treat yourself and enjoy this place!
5
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome! Brought my family of four. Had a great time. Look for Julien, the sommelier. Great guy who took great care when opening my 1990 Dominus. We shared the steak fiorentina which was juicy, tender and delicious.
2
Made a booking weeks ago and end up with a table near the kitchen pantry. Poor service sequence. Meat is hood but all the rest is average including starters and sides. For the money spent there is no way I will be back or recommend that place ! The only positive point was the attentive service from the French sommelier
5
My husband wanted to come here. I wasn't feeling that hungry so ordered the tenderloin and it was so delicious that I ate it all ( thought the husband would have to finish it ) . He ordered a bigger steak and with the thick cut chips it was a perfect meal. The young sommelier from Brittany was very helpful. I agree with others, it's not cheap, but for the quality it was worth every cent. Will definitely return
5
I had dinner for the fist time here on a Sat night booked for 8pm. Wonderful food, just the right amount of friendly and attentive service. The steak according to my husband was as good as promised or better - he really enjoyed it. We shared a cold meat platter for entree and I had the oxtail pasta for mains both of which were really enjoyable followed by desserts, mine was the Tiramisu as well as a serve of ice cream (I needed to be rolled out, rather than walk). The restaurant itself is really pleasing, the bar is nice to sit at and enjoy a wine and the overall ambience inside and out just makes you want to stay. No it's not a cheap night out and even the wine list was hefty for us, but it is well above your average restaurant (or steak). I hope to visit again soon.
4
My wife took me there for my birthday dinner. We arrived to the lobby there was no one there to greet us. We waited for about 7-10 minutes before someone attended to us. Once we got seated the service was great. Our server Julian was great. The food was good although the steak cut was thin hence i got an over cooked steak. A problem that was addressed immediately upon telling the server. They comped my steak. And got a Tirimisu with a candle. Over all a good night
4
We got an 2015 booking at Bistecca on a Friday night. It was reasonably noisy. The food was OK - we had a nice steak, risotto and a dessert. They gave free limoncello which was nice. The service staff were friendly despite it being a busy night. However the food was not cheap and being a Friday night, was a bit slow.
4
We were looking to replicate our bistecca experience from Florence, and this restaurant did not disappoint. Beautiful cut of meat to share that was perfectly done. Attentive service and we were able to dine outdoors. The only "but" was the overall price. All sides were a la carte, and the wines were expensive.
5
I recently had dinner at Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse. I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant, it is a smaller but very relaxing place to have a top notch dinner.Aside from the steak which was outstanding, there are great pasta courses and seafood, something for everyone. Great friendly service and great enviromen
4
Went to Bistecca with my friend to try their T-bone steak (medium rare). The doneness was just right. Succulent meat with tasty veggie and fried potatoes on the side. Delicious. Great ambiance. Perhaps better going in a larger group to try various steaks and wine.
4
Great food, and great location. Just a bit over priced for service and food. Have had better cuts of meat at other steak houses. But would recommend this place again.
4
I ate here with two American colleagues. The place has a nice buzzy ambience but there is more than enough space. The steaks were excellent pieces of meat cooked well, although seemed expensive to us as tourists. Octopus and Risotto plus the spinach and the mushroom sides also impressed. The pricing of the wines seemed a little strange to me and the explanation we got confused the table even further. They also asked us to leave by 8 (which was fair enough we booked late) but served us slowly and then offered us dessert at 755 saying that they wanted the table back at 8. So very good food and friendly but average service
3
We dined here on the recommendation of a friend. Alas we did not enjoy it.The steaks are outrageously over priced and that is all that comes on the plate - just a piece of meat.We ordered a salad it was full of radicho which is a very bitter leaf vegetable, very unpleasant. The food was edible and the service was okay. We just did not enjoy it
5
We had the Fiorentini steak which was very perfect, juicy and tender gigantic steak served for you, it is good to be shared with two to four friends. we also had the risotto al tartufo, i just love truffle! I was expecting more from the service thoug
5
We were there on recommendation and decided to have a birthday dinner there.And it didn't disappoint one tiny bit, the service was excellent and the food esp. the Tuscan sharing steak was a real pampering of the palate. The presentation even though simple, was eye catching.For desserts we had the tiramisu and the pannacotta of which personally for me the latter wins it hands down.The place is pretty cozy as well and the ambience great and if we were not tight for time (one of us had to work a night shift) it could have made for a longer after dinner entertainment. Will definitely keep this place in mind for any future special occasion. Keep it up 
5
Heard the old adage: "Season the steak with more salt then you think you need"?This only works when you have quality meats and the skill to char the outside perfectly to leave a moist, juicy pink centre to a good, 3 inch thick bone-in cut. So for me, the best steak in town isnt Cut, Morton's, Bedrock or Fat Cow. It's here at Bisteca. The Florentine or T bone is the more famous Italian cut but next time you seek the pinnacle of steaks in Singapore, come to Bisteca and order the Costata steak. This is the 1.1kg bone-in ribeye. What you end up with is a charred on the outside fusing into a juicy, tender flavourful (remember the wonderfully flavourful salt rub on the outside) pink/red centred monster of a slab of quality steak.But Bisteca isn't a 1-trick-pony. Try the grilled octopus, oysters and the consistently amazing grilled pork (Yes, please go in a big group, so much more fun and there will be enough of you to order the bone-in steaks and so much more). Service is wonderful. Discreet yet attentive. What is the best kept secret about this place? Go for Sunday lunch. For some reason, it's usually quiet and serenely tranquil. Perfect for the lazy Sunday lunch which should always be followed up by some quality siesta time later in the day

Went for dinner with my parents and family of 4. We loved 1. Fiorentina - the t-bone wagyu steak. It is perfectly char-grilled on the outside but absolutely tender inside. I typically like my steak with some red wine sauce but not this time.... The salt and olive oil bring out the taste of the steak and I just can't stop.... My favourite dish of the night!2. Bistecca's Signature Wagyu F1 (Lombata) - it is juicy and tasty too. My daughters loved them so much that I manage to taste just 1 slice...the F1 Wagyu is pasture raised and organic-feed finished, so we do not feel too sinful having so much meat.... 3. Polipo (Pan roasted octopus with preserved lemon, olives) - it is chewy but not hard, a little crusted and the lemon brings out the freshness of the octopus. We would have a 2nd helping if not for the worry that we can't finish all the food.4. 2009 Badia a Coltibuono Riserva (Chianti Classico Riserva) - dark-colored, full body with a hint of tobacco, complex with a strong finish, it is a perfect pair for the steak - thank to Sangia, our sweet waitress for the night (hope I spell her name correctly), for the great recommendation.5. Panna Cotta - creamy and smooth. It tasted so yummy eaten with the pistachio crumbs.6. Torta Al Cioccolato - dark choc tart with coffee crumble and a scoop of passion fruit gelato. The dark choc is rich and the sourly gelato adds a twist to the taste.My dad and I are not the dessert type, but we loved both the desserts....We also ordered 1. Gamberi (Char-grilled prawns wrapped with house cured lonza on a fennel and orange salad)2. Orecchiette - it is very tasty but a tad too hard for most of us, except for my younger daughter, who savours it.3. Chocolate Gelato with Walnut - both my daughters loved it.... And they were given a complimentary scoop by the generous manager, Amberosa (again, hope I get his name right). 4. Tuscan friesAnd the service..... We felt the heart-warming welcome from the time we arrived till the time we stepped out of the restaurant 2 hours later....Silvia, Amberrosa, Sangia and Wilson made the great dinner a perfect occasion with their smiles and services from the heart. Sangia connected with you daughters immediately with her cheerful manner and hearty laughes. She is also great with recommendation for the food and wine.This is one of the best services I have had in a restaurant.....We spent S$710 for 6.and Of Course, we will be back for more steak

Bistecca Tuscan steakhouse is a beautiful old house that has been refurbished with panache, dark wood and comfy leather chairs. The steak is mind-blowing especially the steak Florentine, it is amazing, with the medium cook, all the juicy and tender of the high quality beef, and the fresh pasta ravioli is of a quality that is hard to find in Singapore. Prices are over the top, but that is acceptable for the high standard. Staffs are Lovely and friendly excellent service, great place. We shall return
4
The food was great, delectable and not overly ostentatious. What I like about the restaurant is that they don't try to amaze you with exaggerating food presentations. The food portions were adequate and one's stomach is not bursting its seams after the degustation menu and wines were polished off.The merigue, steak and prawns are really worth a try if you are new to the restaurant like us.Not to forget we have a lovely F&B manager Xenia who serves with a heart. Indeed it is a restaurant with service from the heart. You can feel that from their approach in customer service as well as the from the tantalising spread prepared

My wife and I had a great meal here last Saturday. Great service and the food was top notch. Oysters were excellent and the T-Bone steak was very good. Topped off with a nice pinot noir, we will definitely be returning.
4
Had a very nice bone-in ribeye steak. Portion was for 2-3. Service was great but our table was located in a somewhat warmer part of the restaurant that wasn't as well air-conditioned.
4
Had a dinner and enjoyed plenty of great beef. The service is very quick and the menu offers a nice variety of meat dishes. Food is quite expensive and this is not your every week kind of place, but for a nice occasion it is perfect. Steaks are very very very tasty and perfectly cooked. We will go back when ever we feel like eating great meat

I heard a lot about this place from my colleague so decide to try it one evening. We had the oyster which is really good but the steak that I have doesnt really wow me. Maybe it just me ordering the wrong steak. We ordered a Ribeye and I know it is should be fat but this is a little bit too fat to my liking

A great Sunday afternoon steak experience. The best steaks in Singapore, and these were cooked to perfection and really tasty. The restaurant has a great feel the only disappointment was that being a Sunday it was not full but none the less a great afternoon. We were also allowed to bring our own wine but they do have an exceptional wine selection. Great afternoon great service good setting

I’ll start off by saying that I am a big fan of this restaurant. I love steak and the chef’s here do a fantastic job cooking to perfection what are excellent cuts of beef. Ambience: it’s a cozy small restaurant with seating inside, upfront, and in the back. My favourite place to sit however is at the bar. I don’t know why people don’t do this more often but it’s intimate and sociable, particularly if the bartender is outgoing. The other nice thing about sitting at the bar, is you can almost always get a spot even if you don’t have a reservation. So for any last minute decisions on a Friday night, the bar may be the way to go.Service: for the most part is very good with knowledgeable staff who can help guide you on your meat selection and BMS (marbling scores). There’s only been one occasion where our waiter seemed off and disinterested but he did apologise at the end of the night, not that it was really necessary.Food: remarkable. Even if you’re a vegetarian the scallops and pasta are excellent alternatives, and the burrata salad is an excellent start to an already rich dinner of incredible steak. The searing on the meat, marbling, cooked EXACTLY how you requested, and so on – it’s near perfect.I’ve yet to have a bad experience at this restaurant. The only thing I will say is you can expect a pricey final bill. Think $300 + / couple with 1 bottle of wine

The steaks seem smaller than before - the fiorentina certainly doesn't feed "2 or 3" as claimed, in fact a (big) Texan cowgirl could gulp one down by herself! They also shrunk the menu - alas no more delicacies like bone marrow or foie gras. It's still very good, albeit no longer great value. Good service, even if a bit taciturn from overwork: given large size of restaurant, ratio of waiters to guests is low - so you should ask for wine and water refills instead of them coming automatically. Still, a satisfying, homey experience compared to the Americans (Cut, Mortons) or Japs (Fat Cow)

I've kind of become jaded over time, thinking that all nice steak joints reach a similar level of quality. Bistecca broke through that plateau for me, and as I've reflected upon it, I've got to give them the title. This is the best steak I've ever had. Some recommendationsRECOMMENDATIONS:* Sit inside. They have al fresco dining, which is tempting, but it's not a super quiet street unless it's late at night, so I'd just go inside and enjoy the aircon / ambiance. * The Florentina Steak - My friends and I got several of their steaks, and they were all excellent, an honorable mention going to a blue cut of their Irish steak. However, the clear champion was the medium-rare Florentina. Absolutely amazing. No sauce, no adjustments required. Just enjoy the ride :)* Take a walk around - The restaurant has lots of fun art, and an interesting view into their kitchen, wine collection, and frig.* Delve into their non-steak items - There were some interesting non steak items that we really enjoyed. The Burrata was really well made, and the cherry tomatoes they provided with it were absolutely excellent. We also got some of their pastas, and everything gets a big thumbs up, so if you have veg / no-beef friends, you should still feel fine bringing them along
5
The Greek yoghurt that came with the rocket salad was creamy, milky and cheesy but not too heavy on the stomach. Definitely a good start to the dinner. We too had the Tortellini di Angello (Lamb and Mint Tortellini). The cheese sauce complemented the mint in the Tortellini pretty well.The much talked-about Fiorentina perfectly served the three of us. We had it in medium-rare and boy was it good! It was perfectly done on the outside with a juicy inside that was not excessively chewy. We finished the steak in a matter of minutes! Desserts were Tiramisu, Torta Al Cioccolato, and Panna Cotta. Kudos to the Panna Cotta! The vanilla aftertaste just left me wanting more after every scoop! Accompanied with a cosy ambience and warm and friendly staff, though rather on the pricey side, the steakhouse was definitely worth the visit

I recently went to Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse with a couple of friends for dinner and it was a great experience, to say the least.The first thing that struck me was the beautiful design and ambience of the place. We had to walk through their little gate and up the terrace, which accommodated al fresco dining, before getting into the restaurant. It was a very nice setting for an evening night out to relax, and I’d say it’s a good place to bring your date or celebrate special occasions too. We were pretty hungry when we arrived, but I can safely say that the 3 of us left feeling extremely satisfied. We first had the Polipo (pan roasted octopus with preserved lemon, olives, Pachino Sicilian tomatoes and rocket salad) and Rucola (rocket salad with tomato, prosciutto and stracciatella cheese). The octopus was plump and nicely cooked, and had great texture that was not overly chewy. As a meat lover, I was surprised that my favourite appetiser was actually the Rucola. The cheese complemented the dish perfectly and made everything work, it was a very nice balance of flavour in a salad, and the prosciutto was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.Next, the Tortellini di Angello (lamb and mint tortellini with parmesan and pecorino cheese). I am not a fan of mint, but I really enjoyed this dish too. The mint was not overbearing and made the dish lighter on the palette, while the pasta and lamb were cooked perfectly.Now comes the star we’d been eagerly anticipating – the Fiorentina traditional Tuscan sharing steak. A generous 1.1kg cut of beef that serves 2-3 people, perfectly medium rare. Steak perfection indeed. This is simply the best steak I’ve ever had. Absolutely delicious and definitely worth it. We had the sides of Asparagi (charcoal grilled asparagus) and Patate (Tuscan fries, rosemary, crushed garlic), which were alright but nothing could take our attention away from the beautiful steak anyway. Last but not least, dessert. We had the Panna Cotta (vanilla panna cotta served with fresh berries and a pistachio crumb topping), Tiramisu (served with coffee custard), and Torta al Cioccolato (valhrona dark chocolate tart with coffee crumble and a scoop of passion fruit gelato). The panna cotta is stunning, with a perfect creamy texture and a real delight. It is the dessert that made room for itself in my stomach. The tiramisu was delicious as well, but I would prefer it to have more of an alcoholic kick. The chocolate tart was rich and the gelato immediately melts in your mouth with a refreshing taste. I love dark chocolate and passion fruit, but I don’t quite get the combination of both flavours. I found myself going back for more tiramisu and panna cotta to end the dinner.Overall, it was a fantastic dinner with a lovely ambience and welcoming staff who made it a comfortable experience throughout. We were definitely well taken care of that evening. If you enjoy a good steak, need a nice venue for a date, or are looking for a pleasant evening out with friends/family, I recommend Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse

Fine dining for dates and groups. Get the platter to share. Last time I went with a group of 6 people, it was about $200-250 per person including wine. Pretty expensive!
4
The T- bone we had was cooked nicely & was very juicy! The staff told us the wagyu beef comes from Victoria, Australia! It's great to taste the food that comes from where we live, lol! Quite expensive but it's a holiday!!
4
Their cheese, whatever it is actually called, is fantastic. The steak was nice for one of the cuts, but mediocre for the other one. Apologies I am a bit vague here as it was one of those days of drinking and I did not order as someone ordered for the group. Worth visiting nonetheless as it was an overall good meal, though I preferred the starters versus the mains on average just because the one cut did not go so well. Would give it another shot if I was in the mood for steak, but it I struggle to give it 5/5 only because I have had overall better steaks in Singapore (though this is relatively up there). The staff was great and thus worth mentioning and booze offering was quite good..

Visited Bistecca for a friend's birthday and I have to confess, I never saw the menu or wine price list, so I can really only comment on the service and food.....The Singaporean anomaly is that the service here is perfect. From the bar staff who made us all welcome till we had all arrived and sat at table, to the helpful and super friendly wait staff. We were looked after by the maitre de (or manager) who's name I sadly didn't catch but no matter....he was superb.As was the food. We began with bread and a yummy pate as well as a gooey, wobbly burrata cheese.....mmmmm. Now, I'm not a huge fan of steak, so I had the rabbit pasta for appetiser. Perfect size and OMG, the BEST BUNNY DISH I'VE EVER HAD. And the steak when it came, was inticing enough for me to be tempted. Melt in the mouth, perfectly seasoned and wonderfully delicious. For dessert, we all had the espresso martinis. Perfect way to finish, really
4
On a balmy, cool evening, this is a great place to dine al fresco – which we did. The inside seating was also nice with well-appointed furnishing, mood lighting and air-condition. Service was good – attentive, pleasant staff, generous with bread and olive oil (their own brand and fantastic!). Wine selection was impressive. Our prosecco was fresh and served perfectly chilled. We had Buratta for appetizer and Tagliattele with Rabbit Ragu as first course. We also had Bistecca Fiorentina (we’re on a quest to find the best in the world!) and, sad to say, we were not delighted. It was juicy and delicious but we stared at each other masticating, which is an anti-thesis to what a melt-in-your-mouth Fiorentina should be! A range of sauces (mustard, horseradish, etc) was presented, again not true to the tradition of Bistecca Fiorentina. A nice place to dine. A bit pricey for the offering. I would come back, yes. But I’d go for the other items on the menu and not their Bistecca
5
What could beat the food at Bistecca? The service!On arrival the manager, Enrico, introduced himself and seated us. The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere with an open kitchen in the middle and dining areas on either side. It was our first time at Bistecca but it looked like there were a lot of repeat customers who were on first name terms with the staff which gave it a lovely feel. While looking over the menu I enjoyed some crusty bread with a beautiful olive oil dip. My wife is gluten intolerant so Enrico suggested a bespoke degustation with matching wines and we happily left the dish selections up to him.The first course was two huge pacific oysters with mignonette. I’d had the bread so left the oysters for my wife who said they were very fresh and tasty. Next was the perfectly cooked Mushroom Risotto. Unfortunately we were between seasons so had it sans truffles. The pan roasted octopus with preserved lemon, olives and salad may very well be my new favourite dish. However, the evening hadn’t peaked as we were then presented with an inch thick, bone in, short rib steak cooked to perfection. This was melt in your mouth wagyu beef and rivalled anything we have ever had - anywhere!Dessert was a refreshing gelato plus a meringue with ginger ice-cream, lemon curd & blackberries that really capped off the meal.Service during the night was ever present but very unobtrusive. Our glasses were constantly refreshed. We even had a visit from the chef, Fernando who came out mid meal to see if everything was fine with the food and that we were happy with the selection.From the initial glass of champagne to the beautiful dessert wine, the wine pairings were perfect. I particularly enjoyed the classic Italian red wine that was served with the steak.This restaurant should be on your must visit list when you are in Singapore
5
I love steaks and what better occasion to visit but when my cousin from Ireland invites me because his wife supplies the grass fed beef to the restaurant !!.Better still when she knows Italian chef Fernando ...so he dazzles with the starters such as the pan roasted octopus and the char-grilled prawns and scallops ...good size, crunchy, fresh and flavorsome Mediterranean spices ...very good .These sea-foods cannot be overcooked as they lose flavor and dry out, but he seared them perfectly.Then came the "piece de resistance " the John Stone 45 day aged boneless rib eye.Done medium rare as it should be . They slice it just the right size for you to enjoy, and look at the center..... pink but not bloody and just the right crustiness on the outside.Now the grass fed aged is slightly dry , compared to a grain fed non aged cut, but the flavour and the tenderness is something really to remember. To add to it Caroline the wine waitress knew exactly the right Italian red to pair the mealIt has been some time since I can say I enjoyed such a good meal in Singapore and to top it off....the cost of the 300 gm rib eye ...at $68/- puts a lot of fancy steak restaurants to shame......so you know what ? we are going there again tonight ( 24th April 2015 ) ...YES..only two days after our first visit....Oh the staff ? delightful ...especially Caroline .....ENJOY !!!

....oh yes, this place is the real deal. From the moment we reserved the table to the moment we reluctantly stepped out of this dreamy place we had one of our most memorably dining experiences. Step up the steps and cross the threshold into Tuscany! Take a deep breath and savour the aromas before you sit down! Seriously! The staff and management were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable of their menu (not often the case here). We ordered the Fiorentina T-Bone for two ($188) with roasted potatoes and asparagus. The roasted potatoes had a light shaving of Parmesan which worked. The steak was cooked perfectly - medium rare - and tasted divine. OMG just thinking about is making want to go back NOW!! This was the best steak we have had in Singapore and we have tried most places. The red wine was recommended with the steak. A deep, dark, strong and very robust Amarone which was a match for the food. And expensive. The ambience was as rich and deep as the wine. Dark woods and the warmth of an old-world genuine Tuscan farmhouse. I seriously want to go back right now!

2nd visit and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Steak is available everywhere in Singapore, and good steak is hard to come and great steak has to be here! The quality of the steak is superb and the pricing is reasonable. And they always have our meat cook perfectly at the right medium for us, or maybe we get too many overcooked or undercook steaks elsewhere in Singapore. Good wine selection to pair with your perfect steak! My mind is still filled with the images of the last steak we had and I'm trying hard to control my saliva from slipping through
4
We had dinner at this steak restaurant a few nights ago. The steak was good and the waiter was very helpful and friendly to recommend on how the steak should be cooked. Marvelous. We also had some grilled prawns which were grilled perfectly. Ambiance also good. Anyway, it was a good experience to having dinner there
5
The service was great even thou busy . N the waiting of the food is quite long time but the good taste is there.... must try their beef carparchio. ..... The only reason I re visit them because of this dish .....
4
As a steak lover I have to say this restaurant nailed it! So succulent and just the perfect temperature.will be back!
4
A couple of weeks ago we went to Morton's Steakhouse at the Mandarin and the meal was a disaster. Undaunted, we embarked on a new meat adventure at Bistecca last night. The two of us shared a 1kg waygu T-bone washed down with couple of glasses of Italian red. Service was friendly and attentive. The meat melted in our mouths as promised by the restaurant's website. My only (mildly) negative observation is the steak was too big! But we certainly got what we ordered ... and it was great
4
Love this place. Only downside is the price of the extras. The food, service and ambience are worth a visit for a special occasion. Third time we've visited and again the steak was top class. However, coffee at $9, sides at $15 and prosecco at $20 is a bit steep. However, we will still go back
3
Bistecca is a fine high quality steakhouse. Location is quite nice, a nice house with a small terrasse in Muhammad sultan road. The meat menu is quite extensive. The main dishes we got were good and well cooked. Still, the reason why I only put 3 stars is that I was not amazed. It was definitely good meat, don t get me wrong... but it was not great for a steakhouse that is in the high end category (pricewise). In this category, I believe there are better options in Singapore (Morton being one, even though it may be even more expansive). Overall, a good experience but IMO, it was either not amazing enough or too pricey (compared to other options).
5
Yes, we made another return visit to Bistecca,our favorite restaurant in Singapore. As vegetarians, we look far and wide for good quality dinner that caters to our limited menu. Bistecca hit it every time. We do know how odd it looks that vegetarians go to a Tuscan steak house, but that should tell you how good the food is, even for us.Today we had a glass of Moscato which was delicious, the chili like corn side (as an appetizer), the pumpkin ravioli and the mushroom truffle risotto. We wrapped up the meal the panda cotta. We also had a salad dish that was specially created by the chef that was so flavorful and creative, simply outstanding. Thank you chef!Each of our dishes was served hot, full of flavor and quite unique. Something that keeps us coming back. So much so that we begged to bring back some to our mother so she too could enjoy, after all she was watching our kiddos while we were out.The service is always best in class, just right for you to enjoy your meal with your loved one but never have a dirty dish or empty glass for more than a second.I'd suggest taking a cab to the restaurant as parking can be challenging, but Bistecca does have a valet...though we generally walk.Thank you to the chef and to the staff of Bistecca for making our meals outstanding, each and every time we come!

On the way back home we stop for a few days in Singapore. We visit this restaurant of a recommendation from our friends. The steak was ccocked on the point we liked and the side dishes was very tasty. Price and service is ok for this little italian restaurant in singapore
4
Came here albeit for a business lunch and wasn't my first time. Nonetheless, it was a serious steak affair, even with the set lunches. I've come to expect a lesser experience when ordering a set lunch at restaurants, given the mass produced approach that most take but in this case, the quality of food was certainly still present. I've always maintained that Bistecca is probably the mecca for steak in Singapore, especially at their price point (more value than other more well known steak houses around these parts). In this case, the steaks were cooked perfectly as usual,with the lot of us splitting between the wagyu and the grass-fed steaks. The service staff also had a helpful recommendation for my less adventurous client to have his steak cooked slightly rare first and if that didn't tickle his fancy, then to cook it further. Nice touch. All in all a good experience at Bistecca and would recommend for a tourist visit or just a nice night out with the other half.
5
First time visit to Bistecca, I have to say I had one of the most tender and best steak in SG. Not just the steak but the other main courses are also good. Dessert is also awesome. The only thing that can be improved is the staff's service as it was little bit slow. Otherwise, I would rate it at 7.5/10. I really like the ambiance too, although it is simply and relatively small place, but I felt cozy due to the warm lights and decoration. I highly recommend you to try the steak. That's all for now folks
5
Well I never leave reviews, but I had such an amazing experience at Bistecca that I had to share. As you step inside, you find yourself in a hip, yet classy ambiance with some great artwork - very unique! We had a pretty large group and were able to reserve a private room, but there were also many couples dining so this place is great for any size group. The burrata was creamy and flavourful and the cold cut platter was excellent. The highlight was definitely the HUGE double cut steak. Often large steaks lack flavour, but with a perfect Char and cooked medium rare it literally melted in your mouth. HIGHLY Recommended if you're looking for some great steak in a cool venue
5
Burrata cheese was amazing.
Pasta dish, especially crab meat black linguine is a must try.
Steaks are better than morton's. Best in Singapore.
For desert - highly recommend the panna cotta and tiramisu.
4
Wonderful steaks, we had the large rib eye which was grilled and excellent. The only thing I could complain about was the presentation of it the steak. Pricey for sure, but definitely worth it.
5
Really like the Tuscany’s legendary wine Brunello di Montalcino and paired with great food bespoke menu by Bistecca’s Chef Fernando Arevalo. Hope to see more of these events more frequently!
5
Highly recommend Bistecca as something you must try at least once. Tastes and flavours were amazing, service was charming and helpful, location intimate and warm. Enough said.
4
Second visit in a month, the food is excellent, the staff are very friendly but on both occasions sadly there was an issue with our table. Visit 1: did not have our reservation recorded. Visit 2: waited 45 mins to be seated at our table while we sat at the bar we waited over 10 minutes to be served a drink. Overall a positive experience and the food is superb, it would be even better if the service improved a little.
4
This italian steakhouse gave me some of the best steak I have ever had! I tend not to order steak as never think of it as that exciting, and while not being vegetarian am definitely drawn to more veg based foods. So for me to come away raving about the meat shows just how good it was!The service could have been better for the standard of the restaurant, as we did have to request refills of water etc. but nothing too bad. The restaurant itself is decked out in dark wood pannelling and has an intimate but contemporary feel.The side dishes and starters is where the italian influence really shows and having spent a lot of time in italy I can assure you that these were authentic and utterly delicous. The simple sides of roasted tomatoes and green beans were perfectly cooked, and one of my dinning companions raved about the beef carpaccio starter.I will definitely be back, although this is on the pricier side so would probably reserve for special occasions
2
We were 5 adults and 1 child (with high chair) celebrating birthday of my daughter. First impression was a low point. Our reserved table showed a 2 by 2 joint table with the 2 chairs squeezed in the middle. We were unhappily given a proper table of 6 after registering our complaint. Next we were provided with one plate of breads with olive dipping oil, placed on one end of the table. Upon request we were then provided another set. All service staff were unfriendly. Nobody smiles in this restaurant! Our beef steaks were delivered mixed up between medium and medium rare. The captain said he had to check with the kitchen. He then confirmed it was the kitchen's fault. What kind of service? Wrong means wrong, why check? Offer a graceful apologies right away. It was a bad dining experience.
3
Expectations were high for this new steakhouse in Singapore. Regrettably they were out of most of the things we were interested in. As were were the first to arrive that evening it was a pretty poor effort by the chef not to be properly prepared. The steaks were ok. The servers were unable to bring all our dishes out together which meant an awkward delay as food got cold on the table. Wouldn't recommend this to place unless you are desperate for aged beef
4
I visited for the price set lunch. Bistecca is open from 12-2pm for just this purpose several days a week. The restaurant has nice decor and is smallish. Only two staff members worked the front. The pace of the meal is quite slow, so expect not to have a power lunch. If you need to, probably alert staff at the onset. I was a single diner and found the pace was far to slow and believe that staff probably should have been tuned in to that. Apart from the sketchy service, where my meal was far to slow and checkins with staff were haphazard, the Wagyu was wonderful and much more nicely priced for a 4 course than it would have been for just the meat in the evening. Further, I enjoyed my dessert and entree more than my two earlier dishes.If you would like to sample the steaks, try a couple at lunch
3
I was looking forward to some Wagyu beef and the restaurant's website promised something special, but in reality it was no better than the tenderloin beef served on the Seabourn Odyssey cruise ship that we were on last week. We had the gastronomic menu with wine pairings and whilst is was quite nice I would not rush back in a hurry
4
the steak was soft and cooked correctly (medium) the anti pasti was also good .The antipasti was delicious and flavorful fresh. The sevice was nice and the price standart in Singapur
4
Very high quality steaks which come from Australia. We were a group of 12 and selected 3 large steaks to share and side orders. Quality was excellent. Wine menu was ok. Overall good place... but expensive, especially the wine.
5
This is how steak should be prepared. Great. A bit expensive but value for the money. I will return here whenever I am in Singapore.
5
Grilled nicely, taste like the fiorentina steak I had in Florence.
Personally I prefer the costata to the fiorentina as it was juicier.
5
We went here on a business trip twice in the same week and were not disappointed.The food in our eyes was exceptional, particularly the prawn starter, risotto and steaks. Service is professional yet personal and we utterly enjoyed the whole experience. So much so we went back 2 days later!
5
I don't even eat steak but I loved it here. Bistecca is a beautiful old house that has been refurbished with panache: dark wood and comfy leather chairs.The steak is (apparently) mind-blowing but I was happy wit the the oysters and champagne, which is very reasonable bubbly for Singapore. It's not a common brand in Singapore and it is very good.The fresh pasta (ravioli) is of a quality that is hard to find in Singapore.It's not cheap, but it's always going to be good here. Lovely friendly staff too
4
We came here specifically for the steak florentine. The steak was done very well except it was over salted once the mouth got adjusted to the salt the steak was good. Had a bottle of borolo that went very well. Staff did a very good job. Good experience. Will come back again.
5
i order the 1,1kg steak recommended by friend... and yes, the steak is awesome, with the medium cook, all the juicy and tender of the high quality beef, i still cant stand my mouth watering eveytime i imagine the steak. yes its pricy but lets say, we get what we pay,hehe.. and their staffs are so nice and friendly, this is a great place to eat.

After a very shaky start when we thought we may have to eat elsewhere, this turned out to be very expensive and only average. We mentioned when booking online that my wife had a shellfish allergy, as this was not mentioned by the waiting staff when we arrived, we said again before ordering. This then caused the waiting staff to go back and forward to the kitchen, initially saying that they wouldn't be able to cook us anything which needed to be grilled (i.e. 90% of their menu!), before the head waiter finally confirmed that they could cater for us and they had a separate grill that they didn't cook shellfish on...after a 10 minute wait! The food was okay, but the portions were way too big for a tasting menu (we had their 'degustation' menu) meaning you ended up both leaving lots of food on the plate (which the waiters thought meant we didn't like it at all) and also over-full. None of the food was spectacular, the steak was nice enough as was the duck pasta, but it didn't have enough culinary excitement or skill to warrant the prices (go to Jaan and see what they can produce for the same money!). Also some of the descriptions were not at all clear on their menu (if you are serving a ginormous portion of steak tartare with raw egg please describe it as that, not just beef tenderloin starter!). An Aperitivo also means a drink - this was described using only one word in the menu, what actually turned up at our table was a meatball! If we had ordered differently we may have been happier, but this isn't somewhere we would return to
3
Steak was ok. Not fantastic. The restaurant was pretty crowded. The service was fine.The steak at MASA steak, which is nearby, is better
5
Visiting Singapore for the first time and based on personal recommendations we had to try this restaurant ...it is well worth taking the trouble to book up...great food and staff who want to look after you...perfect
5
Cannot fault Bistecca it is easily our favourite restaurant in Singapore. The food (scallops, burrata, pumpkin ravioli and of course the steak to name a few), the wine, the service... everything is excellent here.
5
Very good indeed. Cooked as requested. Exceptional service but this is expected in Singapore. Tasty interiour design. Recommended.
5
This was the best meal I've had in a really long time. It was also the most expensive meal I've had in a really long time, if not ever.My husband ordered the steak and I the pumpkin ravioli with sage and brown butter. We also shared gnocchi and scallops (we were hungry). All was incredibly delicious. With a huge (but expensive!) wine list, we didn't really know what route to go, but we were offered the services of the sommelier. She was excellent, even though were choosing between the lower price-range bottles (still close to (100SGD/btl). We were very happy with the wine choice. All in all, the meal was very expensive but totally delicious
4
Beautiful interior, very tastefully done and service to match that. Extensive wine list with fabulous Italian wines. Steak cooked to perfection and side dishes were awesome. Butternut ravioli with sage butter were al dente, slight sweetness of the pumpkin complimented by the savoury sage butter. Definitely one of my favourite dishes. Our waiter Ravu was very attentive and recommended some excellent Tuscan wine. Highly recommende
5
We are vegetarian, so you may wonder why we chose a steakhouse for dinner. We love Italian food in general and you usually can find more vegetarian options. This true for Bistecca. We tried the mushroom risotto and the pumpkin ravioli. They were outstanding. It was actually hard to decide which was best, so we decided when we come back we'll get both again. The bread was plentiful and had a subtle but flavorful smoke taste (well done chef). We enjoyed a wonderful wine from the vast wine list. Dessert was good, but we'd likely try something else next time. The service was outstanding. Very attentive staff, each ensuring we were having the best possible evening. Reservations can be made online or by phone. I'd recommend making them early. Parking can be challenging but there is a valet available, which is recommended. Inside and outside(covered) seating is also available. The initial price point may be a higher than some, but you definitely get the value in return through portion size, quality and presentation.Overall, a great choice for a wonderful evening and highly recommended, even for those who do not eat steak
5
My friend happens to own the restaurant but even without the bias, I would still recommend this place. Amazing quality of food and the steaks are superb. Service is really good too at lunch time. Definitely will come back especially if my friend still owns the place

On my recent birthday we decided to "splash out" and try this restaurant, I have walked past it man times and often wondered what it was like. LocationSet in a row of shop houses, back from the road, up a few steps.Decor and AmbianceThere are few tables undercover outside which you walk past to the main door, the restaurant is long and thin with the glass walled kitchen in the centre dividing the front and back of the restaurant. The decor was dark but cosy and the ambiance was busy with plenty of laughing, the sort of place you feel you will be in for a good night.StaffI called to book a table a couple of hours before we went and I mentioned that it was my birthday, the gentleman who took my call remembered me and showed us to our table. The staff were attentive and friendly and they kindly gave us a complimentary glass of sambuca at the end of the meal as it was my birthday.The FoodI had checked out the reviews before and was a little put off by a small number of negative comments mainly focused on burnt/charred steak and price but i figured some charring was inevitable when cooking steak on an open flame and i don't mind the flavour. Complimentary bread with olive oil are served on arrival and the steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare was recommended and was the right choice, my wife and i had the Costata, Wagyu F1 bone-in rib eye,Single cut, 1.1kg not cheap at $178 with sides of creamed spinach and Kipfler potatoes with herbs and parmesan. there really is no need for a first course if you are having the steak we had between two.The WinePretty much all Italian which I guess you cant complain about in an Italian restaurant but I was a little disappointed as I was looking forward to a big Aussie Shiraz and ended up settling for a Sicilian wine, Nero d'Avola and Shiraz blend, which didn't really hit the spot, a little light for my taste but still a nice wine. if i knew more about Italian wines i might have made a better choice, but the price of some of the wines was beyond the budget for the night.SummaryAll in all it was a very good choice for a special occasion, we both really enjoyed the restaurant and the food

True Italian delights in Singapore. We ordered lots of starters, all of them very tasty and made of quality Italian ingredients. As a main course we had bistecca Fiorentina, which is their special and it was really special!! Amazing piece of beef, prepared medium rare with two dressings and lovely side dishes. For a dessert I had rhubarb ice cream, nice Italian pampering in the lion city!Selection of Italian wines also impressive and served very well (sometimes not a standard even in good Singaporean bars).Only drawback was a slow service, we asked for bill like 3 times and everything took quite long.I would definitely recommend for couple dinner, business dinner or just for Italian food craves :

Robertson Quay can be hit or miss with regards to the restaurants but Bistecca is def a hit. Great service (the lady who helped us with the wines was v good and didn't try to up sell and helpfully suggested a half bottle), steak was excellent (charred on the outside and pink on the inside), the vegetable sides were good (mushrooms and super fluffy gnocchi and chargrilled asparagus), nice atmosphere (there was a large noisy group dining there that night but the staff put the group up the back which was a good idea) and a delicious chocolate tart to finish off. Not cheap but after living in Singapore for 4 yrs, we've realised good food and service come at a price. Given the combination of great food and service, I was happy to pay what they were charging. Not once did the staff have to come back and check on something nor did they forget anything - they topped up our water and replenished the bread regularly

Had a fun, relaxed evening here on 2nd June. Steaks perfect, recommended wines a very good match. Excellent suggestions and service from Helene Mackay the assistant manager. Highly recommended.

Enjoyed a great meal here. Did the black angus steak, red wine (huge selection) and a variety of sides. Tomatoes with basil and asparagus were best. Potatoes were dry. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.

Firstly, for those who have complained previously about the steaks being overdone on the surface and less well done inside, that is the Tuscan style! If one doesn't like steak done that way then I'm sure the restaurant will cook it to more pedestrian tastes, if requested; otherwise, go to a non-Tuscan restaurant.I have been to Singapore a number of times and have to say that, outside the exorbitantly priced places, this is the best meal that I have had here by far. My cousin, who has lived here for six years, takes the view that it serves the best steak in Singapore. The quality of the meat is high, the presentation perfect and the portions generous.Although on the menu only as a starter, the steak tartare is also available as a main course. And if you are partial to that particular dish then you will not be at all disappointed. The meat is flavoursome, the spices do not overpower that flavour and, almost literally, it melts in the mouth. I cannot praise it highly enough!Although expensive at first sight, the semi-comprehensive wine list is not at all overpriced when one takes the excessive duty on alcohol into account. And the service is excellent - attentive but not at all cloying.Excellent coffee, also.All in all, a real treat
5
In Singapore standards are bi-polar; either low grade with poor service or top end with waiter constantly hovering. This place is one of the few gems in between.We love the fact we can either go for cheaper pastas or spend up big on meat, depending on our mood and budget. The owner recognizes us now and we trust his wine choices for us; never too over the top and always just right for our chosen dishes. Only 1 gripe. We originally loved the terrace out front but now the smokers have moved out there we only eat inside. I wish they would ban smokers entirely. Who needs smoke blowing over their meal
4
We arrive and while still in the car the gentleman from the entrance comes and offers us the free valet parking. That is definitely a plus in his area of town where it is so hard to find a parking lot. We enter the restaurant and our reserved table for four persons is waiting for us on the terrace. The menu card reveals quickly - we are in a real Italian Steakhouse. Depending on the number of your party you may order a 1.1 or a 2.3 kilogram steak, next to many other interesting menus, and it will be done exactly according to your liking with additional delicious side dishes. To choose the vine with our meal was a major undertaking with so many good possibilities. But the well informed and friendly staff member Carolyn Elizabeth guided us eloquently through the many prospects. Her charm and the atmosphere in the restaurant fostered a good conversation amongst us two couples who were in awe of the friendly service and delicious food.Leaving the steakhouse our car was waiting for us right at the front step. What a great and lovely evening with friends and good food

Celebrated my birthday with family recently. The restaurant has a beautiful ambience and is dark and cozy. We ordered a range of appetizers, oysters, rocket salad with burrata cheese, tuna cappraccio and cold cut platter. Everything was done perfectly and the homemade bread were fabulous! We went easy on the main course with 200g grass fed black angus tenderloin, 200g filetto qand charred 400g grilled pork cutlet to share. This fed perfectly for our group of 4 adults and 2 kids. The quality and cooking for the main courses were also excellent. The sommelier also recommended a very good wine to go with everything. Overall pricey but its worth the splurge once in a while
5
This is in the top 15% of places we've visited. Not many 5s on our list but this place is worthy. We had no booking but as we'd arrived early evening there were still a small number of tables which were not booked until later. From arrival, we were acknowledged by all staff we came across with being over bearing. Our table service was excellent, attentive knowledgable. Food (fillet steak and cod) was excellent. Ambience also very good. Restaurant and open kitchen appeared very clean. Beer only by the bottle and pricey was a downside. Not a cheap night out but certainly one we'll repeat

A long and narrow restaurant set among the Muhammad Sultan row of shophouses - pleasant in atmosphere but those bringing babies in prams, do note that there is a flight of stairs required to enter the restaurant. The decor revolves around the kitchen which is set right in the middle, which is interesting and yet has somewhat made the entire restaurant look more cramped than it really is.The steak - i think one needs to be aware that this restaurant serves Fiorentina steak - and its done charred on the outside, with a medium or medium rare inside, flavoured simply with salt (we think). This is slightly different to the steak style served in many of Singapore's other steakhouses. We had the wagyu bone in rib eye and it was very good with a pure taste of good quality beef without being smothered by any flavourings.The "but" in the review is caused by very mediocre sides which was a rather flat accompaniment to the great steaks. Our sides of mushrooms and fries were just ok and to be honest probably spoiled the enjoyment of the steaks a little.An average score may be a little harsh to some, but there are good steakhouses in Singapore that deliver a more enjoyable overall experience from both a culinary and ambience standpoint. The Fiorentina steak style though is unique and well done
4
Singapore is replete with new, chic places that are "good", but one often (or at least I) leaves feeling with "was it really fulfilling (not just from a caloric perspective) and/or worth the tab?"Well, Bistecca was, both from a culinary perspective, as well as a very pleasant atmosphere and competent, friendly staff. The meal started with some rustic bread with two dips (one i believe was a chicken liver or something pate', very good). We had scallops for starters (good), then I ordered the porcini/black truffle risotto, while my companion ordered an 800grams cut of steak (the filet was sold out). I was very pleased with the portion of my risotto (not a paltry two-table spoons). It was rich (ie, creamy) and while not spectacular, it was definitely very good with generous servings of mushroom / shaves of black truffle. Girlfriend remarks on the steak were along the lines of "amazing". The steak was served with a basil sauce and a classic steak sauce (complimentary, unlike at some other steakhouses where they nickle-dime on bernaise..)No complaints on the side of creamy spinach.As there was a bottleneck in the kitchen and we had to wait a while for our mains, the staff offered complementary dessert (well, at least one): We had a very good tiramisu (just perfectly heavy mascarpone goodness) and a refreshing apricot "sorbetto" (maybe more icecream than sorbetto ;) ).Bill was about $100ish per head (with no booze), but one does not leave hungry, that's for sure. Btw, I liked that the staff also gave the option of "sparkling, still ...or just plain" on the water..

This Italian restaurant is run by a native Italian and so the food is much more authentic than others you may visit in Singapore. One goes principally for the steaks - which are superb, certainly the best I've eaten for a long time, possibly ever. They are big so make sure you haven't eaten too much lunch to do it justice! The side dishes are also great and the tuna carpaccio as a starter was lovely.The service was excellent, friendly, knowledgeable and on time.You can choose to eat inside or out, but you will need to book particularly at the weekends. This is an expensive restaurant even by Singapore standards so expect to pay for the best steaks in town
5
This restaurant is discretely positioned but fairly easy to find. It has a small terrace at the front and the restaraunt itself is somewhat long and thin with the kitchen set in the middle, so diners have a good view of what's going on in there! The restaurant has a pleasant and lively atmosphere and the service was very good - intelligent, friendly and prompt.We were party of 4 and two of us ordered starters, the tuna carapccio and the octopus salad. Both were excellent and are highly recommended. For main course we ordered: the Wagyu bone-in rib-eye (for two); the filetto and the diaframma. The rib-eye was billed as for 2-3 people. My advice is that it will serve 2 good appetites or 3 smaller appetites - I was certainly glad that a 3rd diner wasn't looking to share ours! The steaks were char-grilled and the rib-eye was cooked Pittsburgh style, well-charred on the outside and rare on the inside. Both us agreed that it was among the best steaks we have ever tasted. I also tried a bit of the others - very different cuts of meat but still excellent.For dessert we had the rhubarb and strawberry soup and the pannacotta. Both were very good, although I thought the pannacotta was perhaps a little too firmly set.Overall it was an outstanding meal. It was expensive but I think the quality justified the high price and we shall undoubtedly return
4
We were a party of 7 and shared the 1.1kg Florentine steak with a 500g Angus. Together with a few appetisers - octopus, squid ink pasta & mesclun salad as well as sides like french fries, asparagus, and mushroom it was a balanced meal for us. As we are not out-and-out carnivores but appreciate a steak feast once in a while, the quantity and quality of what Bistecca Tuscan served up was very much appreciated by us. The extremely pleasant dining room and courteous service really made it a very enjoyable meal for all of us. Some of us are already planning a return to this steakhouse in the near futur
5
The service was very attentive and knowledgeable, it is very refreshing to have such quality waiters.Although the most expensive item on the menu was recommended, it was worth it as a one off fantastic treat. The steak was easily the best we have ever had! This was the florentine steak for 2 and it had such a lovely flavour and texture.It was very expensive however it is a treat
5
Came back to Singapore after almost 10 months of not being here and took some clients to Bistecca, one of whom was a vegetarian which worried me a little. Bistecca did not disappoint at all.We started with the free bread which i admit was better in the past, but that wasn't the highlight. I was super impressed by the cool table at the bar which is bigger than last time! And the drinks were fantastic especially the sparkling italian wine! :) I have to commend whoever is sourcing the steaks though, they were much improved from the last time i went there.. and the last time i came it was already fantastic. The hanging tender was super easy to eat and juicy, as was the 800g grass fed steak i had as well. Very delicious.A new pasta dish i enjoyed was the "Orienchientte"? Which had some sausage and cheese.. Cooked al dente and to perfection. We also ordered another pasta dish and a salad for my vegetarian pal who enjoyed it. The desserts were fewer in selection this time, but i enjoyed the chocolate tart and my friend enjoyed eating the tiramisu. I was hoping they served the "Bombaloni" fried dough with a coffee sauce, but it wasn't on the menu anymore, so bring it back on sometime!! After the meal, we drank a bit more, then i was off to Changi airport where being half drunk i crashed on the plane flight back to JFKâ€¦. what a great restaurant again and until next year.

We were a party of 4 at this steak house on 12/4/14. The Florentine T steak was commendable but the wagyu rump was disappointing. Squid ink pasta was tasty but portions were small. The burrata cheese was very good and grilled octupus excellent as starters. One should skip the desserts apart from the Tiramisu. Ambience was good but marred by very loud guests seated near us. The wait staff should have exercised discretion to restrain from over entertainting these loud guests to the dismay of other guests as the tables are packed tightly
3
Agreed, the Bistecca Fiorentina is one of the best steaks I ever had. But then the rest of the experience simply does not live up to the very steep price tag. Side dishes were not more than ok and service is poor. For the very first time in my life had the bar keep to consult a recipe to mix a "signature drink" and then had the balls to ask whether it tasted "as it should"..
5
I'm a carnivore and will have steak any chance I can get in a restaurant. I've dined at my fair share of steakhouses in Singapore, including the much hyped/raved about Cut in Marina Bay Sands. Bistecca was better. I don't know how this place has managed to fly under the radar as I have never heard of it amongst local/expat friends in Singapore and instead, found it on Trip Advisor. The steak was simple yet perfectly seasoned and so tasty! Our starter of burrata, ham and tomatoes was also nice. My dessert of chocolate tart was fairly average, but the steak more than made up for that. The service was attentive and impeccable, like you would get in the US, without being too much. It was expensive but I didn't feel ripped off. I have paid more for an inferior steak in Singapore. A real gem of a place and highly recommended
4
Was there in April and the staff was totally friendly and helpful especially Caroline the Sommelier and Helene the manager made me feel well at home and gave me very good recommendations in terms of wine and food.The staff was also very helpful in providing recommendations in the types of food available.Overall I would definitely recommend steak and wine lovers to try this place
5
I visited Bistecca with my wife for dinner. I had seen some reviews that highly praised the restaurant and I can see why.The restaurant is almost hidden away in a shophouse close to Robert Quay where you find a lot of commercial food/bars. The restaurant has a modern, expensive feeling and done well unlike other premium establishments. I was pleased to be seated next to the glass window of the chef cooking up the huge steaks over the fire grill, a pleasing sight for me in any case. They have a wide selection of wines for most budgets and I was pleasantly pleased with my choice.We had steaks and some sides all done to perfection with prompt attention from the waiter.We were the first ones in that evening but it soon filled up and the atmosphere was pleasant.It came to about S$400 for the 2 of us with a nice bottle of red, a tick pricey but most definitely worth it
5
Saturday night dinner, food and service were exceptional. The steak was very tender and cooked perfectly. The salted cod was beautiful, a chunky piece of fish sat on a bed of beans and vegetables. If you have room for a dessert it has to be the Tiramisu! Now discovered I'll definitely be a regular visitor.
5
Meat is absolutely fantastic, and they know how to properly grill it. Place is cool and stylish, with interesting model photos. Excellent service. Very good wines.
4
I had my birthday celebration at Bistecca with a good friend, just 2 of us. We both agreed that the steak was awesome. Medium rare was delicious, one of the best I ever had. However, we were asked if we will like to have Macallan 18. We both decided why not. A shot each of Macallan 18 for both of us came up to SGD78. I was in shock. Maybe it's just me, but would appreciate if the price was advised to customers prior to serving. Though I do take some responsibility for not asking. All in all, stick to the meats, they do make really good steaks
4
One of the best fiorentina steaks in Singapore, using an exclusive Australian cross wagyu of MBS 6+ imported only to Bistecca Tuscan. Grilled over a wood fire, there's that smokey flavour from the fats that burn and infuse back into the meat, Tuscan style. Try the steak tartare as well as the home made cured meats too.Service is impeccable, as well as a very romantic, dim, dark wood setting. Classy and definitely recommended for romantic dates or business dinners
4
First impression, great atmosphere rustic elegant dining room, wait staff had excellent wine knowledge & very helpful. We had the ages ribeye on bone to share with sides, hand cut chips & charred asparagus, sauces included. Yes its a little pricey but for what we had on a par with Au$ but the quality & service where above. Cheese platter for one was more than enough for 2 to share for sweets, and the coffee was the best I had had in Singapore for the week we where there
5
We took four business friends to Bistecca, and shared a wonderful evening. The restaurant was comfortable and quiet enough to converse easily. The food was amazing. The sommelier, an American expat, made the evening memorable and fun by swapping stories about Italian wine with us. If we lived in Singapore, Bistecca would be one of our regular haunts.
5
We dined here on Saturday night and had the best steak we have has in Singapore for 7 months. A quality piece of meat that was cooked to perfection. Service was probably too attentive. This is a rarity these days. Atmosphere was spot on with the busy kitchen adding to the evening. Very highly recommended
4
Went to the restaurant for Dinner with friends. We sat outside int he open and were able t have lovely steaks and wine and finished off with Cigars.3 of the 4 steaks we ordered were perfect and they readily replaced the 4th steak which was over done for what was supposed to be a 'medium rare'. Service was excellent and I would highly recommend this place which as a decent variety of high quality vegetarian pastas as well
4
One of the best steak dinners I have had was here at Bistecca in Singapore - and considering I have spent some time in Argentina, that's saying quite a bit. The steak was perfection: seasoned simply with salt and perhaps a breath of butter. The sides were done excellently, from the still-slightly-crunchy asparagus to the perfectly cooked gratin. I highly recommend dinner here, but do be warned: it will come with a bit of a price tag
5
Some of the most delicious steak to be had in SIngapore. We shared the 1.1kg Costata Wagyu Rib-eye and it was mouth watering. Great fun to watch the chef grilling the steaks over hot charcoals.The whole evening was very relaxed and enjoyable. Nice ambience , service was excellent and our waitress was very knowledgeable on the Italian wines. Not just for the carnivores - some delicious Pacific Oysters, fresh calamari and very nice Cod. I'd go back just to have the gorgeous Burrata !
4
I was in Singapore only for a couple of days on business and the people I was meeting arranged the dinner. They did not know that I rarely eat beef. However, I was not disappointed. The place is not that large, and is very popular, so I would recommend having a reservation, especially if your party exceeds 4 people. The menu was varied and don't pass up the tapas - we ordered 5 or 6 and shared them. All were delicious. For entrees I had the stuffed pork and it was great. The others at the table agreed it was better than their beef. One of my associates had the beef tongue, which she drooled over. This place is a little pricey but worth it. Also, it appears to have a great wine selection, and the wine we had with dinner was very good
4
I have been to Bistecca's in several cities (don't know if they are franchises of some master program, as the menus, standards and dÃ©cors are different from one another), and this one is among the best. Our party shared different cuts (fiorentina, costata, sampler), and the steaks are very good - not as superb as the best in Argentina or the very top in the US, but still quite succulent. The accompaniments (foie gras, bone marrow) are sinfully yummy. Side dishes come in small portions and are passable. At our visit, service was as good as it could get with just one overwhelmed waiter (and a manager who was helping). Long wine list, reasonably priced. Overall, a very satisfying experience, and good value given the quality
5
Came here twice with my extended family and both times we left the restaurant rubbing our stomach with glee. the price points are reasonable, the service attentive and the food really really good. because we are a table of 12, it means we get to try lots of different starters and mains and they all came out very well. The steaks are nicely burnt outside and tender within with the full taste of beef. will be back soo
4
I decided on this location for our anniversary dinner. Soup was broccoli. It had great texture and flavour! We had a regular ribeye and wagyu striploin (MB6) medium rare, with sides of bone marrow,foie gras, gratin and mushrooms. The charring was great on the wagyu but didn't go well with the ribeye. We later brought the steak home and found out that a little less heat on the ribeye made it great! Service though was exceptional! Will be more careful with the steak and how it's done on the next visit
4
The food was really good - had the Bistecca Fiorentina with friends, which was good but the skin was too charred. Other than that, it was excellent. Desserts are ok and can get better as well. Overall, still a great dining experience but I did feel it was overpriced. That being said, I still give it 4/5 as overall the quality was truly of that level. I would probably eat here again if there were new exciting things on the menu - but too over-priced to visit regularly
4
Had Sunday lunch with 3 friends and we ordered their florentine which I found too charred at the sides. Probably the pan was too hot when the chef cooked it. The sides such as asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes etc were exorbitant at $15 per side for a small serving. The king prawns were nicely grilled & I love their tiramisu and this other Italian dessert which had a lemony sponge cake. Service was great & very prompt. But I guess it's so since we were the only ones there, other than another couple.
5
We went for my 60th birthday dinner...straight off the plane...stopped at the hotel to drop off luggage and taxied there. Lots of small restaurants on this street and the driver couldn't find the place for a while. The atmosphere was excellent, the service was superb and the food was delicious. Of course it should be at over $300US for two people but I think it was well worth it. Overall a delightful and memorable experience. Thanks
5
Went to the restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. Mind you, this is the second time we had gone there to celebrate his birthday. First we were greeted with an air of familiarity even when we had visited the place a year ago.Secondly, the food taste just as great... I simply love the way they serve the food.... Simple and elegant...The side dishes were lovely, we ordered the asparagus, as well as the king prawn. As for the mains, we ordered the one to share...It was yummy!!!! as long as you are a meat lover..
4
Visited this restaurant with 3 other friends . Two had been here before and were raving on about it for months. So expectations were high from my end.The set lunch was either a 3 course or a 4 course. We all went for the four course .The starter and second course were great and finally it was time for the biggie - the steak main course. The meat was nice and well cooked and we polished it up with a lovely gloss of house red wine. For a steak lover like me, the steak was a bit small but then it was a set lunch deal so can't really complain.Deserts were very good as well.Refreshing to visit this place and see prices as being high but reasonable for the quality of meat served. Other steak places have simply priced themselves out of offering an 'enjoyable yet reasonably priced meal '. Steaks are great and I love them but i refuse to pay the earth for them. Bistecca offers that just nice balance between quality meat, decent service, nice ambience, good wines and drinks list, an outside smoking area and yet is not priced sky high so as to cause indigestion !!!!Lovely experience overall and highly recommended for meat lovers

Read all the rave reviews about the food and was looking forward to this visit and a family member's birthday gave the opportune reason to go. The place was nice looking and there was a nice buzz when we arrived ... everything looked promising for a fine evening. We were shown to our table (having made reservations earlier in the week) and from then on the evening sort of went downhill. It wasn't any one thing that was so disastrous but alot of things that was not up to mark that culminated in the feeling that we didn't really enjoy our time there. The food - we ordered from a special ocassion set that included the famed fiorentina steak and pasta starter and dessert meant for 4 persons. As there was 5, one of us had wanted to order the hangar steak. However, the waiter was very concerned that we were ordering only the set and repeated at least 3 times that the set was meant for four - almost an accusation that we were trying to cheat the restaurant by trying to order for 4 only. He failed to wait and to understand when we were trying to add the order for the hangar steak for the 5th person. Even after finally getting the order for hangar steak, his parting salvo was that the starters and dessert from the set only fed four !!! Frankly, a top class restaurant (even if parties wanted to share portions) would have the class and professionalism not to make such a song and dance about it. When the food came, sadly, the fiorentina was rather burnt at edges, to the point that we just cut those burnt parts off as it was too carbonized to eat. Seeing it costs an arm and a leg, to our minds, the fiorentina was not worth the money. The hangar stead in fact was much tastier and better cooked ie. not burnt. Dessert was just OK although the pasta starter was quite nice. The service - glasses were not refilled and it was hard to get service. Our waiter seemed to be too busy but then other waiters when called would not serve us but just referred to our waiter with his perennial "give me 5 minutes". Really wanted to like this place and add another old faithful to my list of fav restaurants but no way ... there's far better restaurants giving better food, service and/or value for money in Singapore
4
Classy restaurant, owner and main chef are italians which tells you it must be authentic. The food is really good, mouthwatering antipasti and you gotta love the steak. Perfectly cooked as they do in Florence, exquisite beef. The only downside is that mine came a bit too late and was not hot, still warm though, but it ruined my experience a little bit. Loved the wines and excellent service. You pay for it, guaranteed
5
I would highly recommend the house special steak to any red meat lover.
We shared 1 between 4. Genuinely tender and very flavoursome.
5
Genuine, well designed, great service and epic steak house - visiting or living in the Sing, a must visit and highly recommended.
4
Dined here recently on the set lunch at $45++ each for 4 courses. Salad for starter, 2 choices of pasta for the second course, steak for the third and some sorbet for dessert. The steak was a little chewy but otherwise decent. Decent sized servings. Will definitely consider coming here again for lunch
5
We went for Saturday lunch.it was quiet but the service was friendly and efficient.the bread was outstanding and a good indication of what was to come.three of us shared a Bistecca florentine which was nothing less than sensational.by far the best version of this in Singapore.there is a good Tuscan wine list with a truly memorable badia a coltibuono chianti Classico which perfectly matched the steak.overall this is a great place for great Tuscan food and wine.rush there
5
I can certainly recommend this restaurant if you are a steak lover. The meet is done in the typical Italian Tuscan style. The menu is pretty wide and you have a few meat choices but unfortunately the "fiorentina" steak was sold out at 9pm which was disappointing. We hade "costata" steak instead which was very nice but slightly to rare for a "medium-rare" order. They have a very nice wine list and the service is very pleasant. It is important you make a reservation. And last but not least check you bill as we discovered (too late) ours was wrong upon coming home. We certainly will return
5
Bistecca is always our must go when my husband and i visit Singapore. I usually don't like steak that much but Bistecca is one of the very few steakhouses that i'd like to go back again and again!I can't remember what we ordered for appetizer specifically but they are really good. With it's great variety, i can always expect to be surprised. The steak is so tender that it really melts in the mouth. I like the mix flavor of salt comes with steak more than the sauce they provided last time. Their steak is of great quality so a little salt is enough to make it stands out without covering the taste. We had gelato for dessert last time and again, terrific! I don't know how they make gelato so special but they just did! Besides food, the service is good, too. Last time i couldn't find my ideal cocktail in the menu, they asked my need in detail and made me a special drink off the menu! It's quite enjoyable from the beginning to the end. I will highly recommend Bistecca to anyone who wants to enjoy a great meal with nice service and environment
5
I enjoyed a wonderful evening with 5 business partners at Bistecca Tuscan. The food and wine list are outstanding - the charcoal grilled steaks are outstanding. Service is exceptionally good - I can really recommend this place. The atmosphere is cosy - good for both business and private dinners. Five stars, I will come back
5
We started with the salami platter which was very good - 4-5 different types. 1 of them was too chewy thoughThe bread was fresh and warm, but a tad hard. Another patron also made the same comment 10 min laterCouldn't wait for the main event, the steaks. My wagyu fileto tenderlion turned out to be perfect. I tasted my friend's grass fed ribeye. It was way too chewy. I think the safe bet is to order the wagyu each time and avoid their cheaper grass fed selectionsThe sides were disappointing though. The naturally plumb and juicy portobello mushroom was cooked till burnt and dry. And ONE mushroom was $10. The fries were too skinnyMy friend finished off with a chocolate gelato, which looked niceSpotted a few interesting pasta dishes which i might try next tim
5
Went for dinner with friends. Sommelier is outstanding - really knows her stuff. We bought a bottle of white wine from the wine list and took some of our own red wine which was treated with a great deal of respect. Food was great - shared an anti-pasti platter. For main, the boys shared the Costata, girls had the Fillett. All cooked to absolute perfection with a nice salty crust. Vegetables were fabulous (note though - no chips/fries). Shared a desert as we were pretty full - Cannoli - lovely - not too sweet. Whole bill was surprisingly moderate for steak in Singapore. We'd go back. You need to book though - they are fully booked most of the time

Wonderful steaks, we had the large 1.2kg rib eye which was grilled and excellent. I went with three friends for an evening out and really enjoyed it. We have had good steaks in other restaurants but Bistecca is really the place if you love steaks. A good selection side dishes is also available for your steaks including mashed potatoes to die for, mushrooms, gratin, creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts. Attentive service which was not over bearing. Enjoy

Just finished eating in bistecca and ready to go back soon.
The fiorentina steak was just perfect.
Pricey for sure, but worth it.
Enjoy your dinner!

Been to Bistecca twice now and really like it! Great flavour, choice of food and the service is pretty good too! My husband and I thought the lighting, decor and ambiance created was perfect for the style of restaurant and would definitely return.

My wife and I visited this place few days ago since I am from Tuscany and wanted to eat some food that reminded me of home. Bistecca clearly delivered well above our expectations!We arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before closing time and nonetheless was the service and food absolutely impeccable. They kept the kitchen open longer in order to serve us our food and let me tell you that it was just like at home, if not better! Excellent authentic Italian ingredients prepared just as they would do in Italy (especially in Tuscany, given the chef's background) accompanied by really good Italian wines - do I need to add more? Well, actually yes. The service was absolutely amazing and all the staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. Make yourselves a favor and let the chefs, Karu, Ellen and Bob spoil you like you have never been.We simply adored this place and thanks to all the staff for a fantastic evening

This place stands out amongst recent restaurants I've visited in Singapore as it actually has great service... European-style. So refreshing! Great atmosphere for a date-night, but a bit on the pricey-side so be prepared to shell out at least $400 for 2 people (& that's just with one bottle of wine). You can always head over to Wine Connection afterwards for some cheaper drinks! Great food though, loved the steaks & sides... was unfortunately too full to try their deserts. Would happily return

Couples dinners (2 girls / 2 guys). My second visit this year and pleasantly surprised with a new menu. The chef has managed to maintain high standards with their new selection. Scrumptious starters and hearty steaks, although tbh I am a self confessed steak lover. Aside from the juicy meats, they have a wide selection of starters and familiar Italian dishes on their menu which are perfect compliments and great for sharing. The staff were sharp and attentive, and a quick shout out to the sommelier who picked out a weighty 2003 Barolo to pair with our mains.The restaurant has a great atmosphere, playful paintings, wrapped with warm furnishing giving an intimate visit. Naturally in Singapore it is family friendly and has a second floor which I am considering for a 30th birthday venue.Personally not somewhere I can afford to visit weekly but for fine dining it is great value for money.Areas for improvement: bigger bar that is closer to the terrace for outdoor socialising

I met with a mix of friends from Singapore and out of town at Bistecca. We asked for medium-rare and got a T-bone steak that was well colored on the outside and tenderly pink on the inside. The texture and taste of the meat was very good, as the restaurant imports the meat from Australia. We got a bunch of sauces on the side as well, although I prefer no sauce. The only thing I could complain about was the presentation of it the steak. It could have been more artfully presented. But we did order the mozzarella and eggplant as a starter, and it was wonderfully arranged on a a bed of balsamic vinegar gel and oils. It almost looked like it was painted on to the plate. I also found the artwork on the walls quite provocative. The service was attentive and accommodating. I asked that they turn off the air conditioning unit above our table, as I found it way too cold and they obliged without a excuse or fuss. We order some sides, vegetables and mashed potatoes. All very good as well. We had no room for dessert but I'm sure it would have been superb as well. Overall, quality of food was excellent; taste, presentation and proportions all just right

I heard of this restuarnat from a friend who lives in Singapore, and spending alot of time in Singapore it was time for me to try some good steak. Bistecca was indeed a fantastic choice.I saw some of the reviews and saw it range from really great to "too expensive" or something like that. Well, i've tried alot of steak joints in Singapore, and i'll be honest here. Bistecca is great value for money compared to the competition around town.. And here's the highlights.1) Steak: moist and easy with each bite. Ordered medium rare and was perfect. 2) Side dishes: roast potatoes were excellent. asparagus was so-so.. but i'm not a vegetarian joint so i'll let it slide3) Wine: served well and given great suggestions. Wasn't even expensive. 4) Desserts were great. I really enjoyed the strawberry rhubarb with froyo on top. 5) Oh yeah, the tagliatelle was delicious, well cooked...Friend who took me raved about it. and now i'm raving about it too.. Excellent find in Singapore
5
Fascinating artwork surrounding the restaurant. Came in with a couple of friends and sat at the bar for drinks as we were early for our reservation. One of the owners was there so chatted a bit with him. Walked to the terraced patio in the back, which was a great spot; potentially very romantic but was under construction. I wish I could have remembered everything that was ordered, but I was sadly not taking close notes. All I knew was that this is one of the first times I had ever refused another bite of steak because I was so incredibly satisfied. It is definitely more of a nicer place, not for a casual dinner unless you're decently well off. Good for business dinners as well. Would definitely come again

Our friends have been talking up this steakhouse and we were delighted to try it out during a one-day stopover. It did not disappoint!We had a big lunch:Our starters included spicy rigatoni (delicious!) and Rucola with very yummy ripe tomatoes.For the meat, we shared a Lombata and Hanging Tender as well as a Porchetta. The Lombata had amazing marbling, but I personally preferred the wonderful meatiness of the Hanging Tender. Both excellent quality meat - texture and taste. Perfectly made to the medium rare we requested. They brought out a bunch of sauces, but I took it with just a bit of Dijon mustard - yum! The Porchetta was beautifully presented, and I enjoyed the combination of the crispy roast pork belly with beans and apple mash.Don't remember much about the sides: broccoli and some potato hash - they were fine. Not overcooked. Not over-seasoned.I did not think I had room for dessert, but am so glad we got the tiramisu -- I did not expect to be so pleasantly surprised - it is good! I thought I would just have a bite but ate the majority. And it was also beautifully presented. Overall, high quality ingredients, cooked well - thoughtfully and not over seasoned - and good presentation. Excellent service.Interesting commissioned wall art -- you can see their website for an example -- and an excellent ambience for a special date or if looking for a comfortable and formal place.A foodie friend told me this is a great example of Singapore having great restaurants with international cuisine. I am impressed
2
The food is really just soso. Steak burnt on the outside and raw inside (asked for medium). Burrata comes without tomato's and they charge if you want any. Ravioli is a miserable 5 pieces. The sommelier doesn't top up your wine.Basically if you want steak, go to another place. If you want Italian, go to a other place.The atmosphere inside is nice
4
all 3 of us shared the meat platter starter which was ample. The strip steak main was delicious, well cooked, and of high quality. Service was efficient and unobtrusive. The gavi di gavi needed ice to cool it;

I've lived in Singapore for just over 3 yrs now and only just found this restaurant.First impression are really appealing. The long bar at the entrance and wine cabinets seem to go on for miles, the restaurant area is decorated really tastefully and has a lovely relaxed feel.Service is brilliant and the waiters are so friendly and helpful. The menu is varied and I loved the share plates, especially if there's a few on your table.Both my husband and I opted for Filletto (200g Fillet) it was cooked to perfection, but my only criticism was the rock salt they sprinkle on the top of the fillet, kind of spoils the texture of the meat with a hard bitter bite of salt. Did mention this to the waiter and he said next time he will remember and make sure they do not put salt on mine.The potato and porchini gratin was to die for but wasn't keen on the side of sautÃ©ed spinach , it tasted really bland but again the waiter said they are trying to tweek the menu. It hasn't put me off, I will definitely be back. A great find. Thanks Bistecca for a lovely meal
3
When the bill comes in at $500 for 2 you'd expect to eat in some sort of amazing place. Nope. Just wine and 2 steaks.The service was good so that's on the plus side, but overall there are better places to spend that kind of money.
5
I'm lucky to go on business trips out to Asia, especially warm and sunny singapore.So i returned for a part deux of Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse.. Did not disappoint. I saw the reviews since my last visit and wondered why people thought it was so "expensive"? I had the "hanging tender" a new dish i didn't try last time and my two buddies shared a "Florentina", which was great as usual. The prices are similar to what you would have in Manhattan, and the wine was terrific. I tried the Sangiovese this time which went well with the hanging tender.I do say though, some pasta dishes (ie: the tagliatelle and the wagyu meatballs that i had last time are a great deal, lots of portion, not to bad prices).. I tried the calamari and the pumpkin ravioli this time, great taste and presentation, but maybe not as good value as the other pasta dishes. Finally, dessert was great.. Tiramisu and the Italian donut really went down well. What i like is consistency. Some restaurants blow you away the first time, the second time, it doesn't, then its good again. This place, it was consistent.. Excellent efficient service, something that i found missing at other Singaporean joints... They need a Bistecca at other parts in Asia..

Florentine steak a must try! It was especially unique in the Singapore steak scene. It was moist, smokey and tender. Great cut with minimal seasoning to bring out the best flavour. Starter to try is the burrata cheese, sides were ordinary (not in a bad way) but desserts were fantastic, apricot sorbet was special and cannoli (think Godfather), a rarity in Singapore, is worth the stomach space (if there's any left!) Service was great too, staff was polite and helpful with recommendation for first timers. Will definitely visit again, with a bigger group next time (they have private room space). They are almost always full house, highly recommend making reservation instead of walking in. Overall superb experience :

My wife and I visited this place last year on our honeymoon, and again this weekend. It was a great experience for the both of us, especially me a steak lover that has sampled steakhouses all over Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei. Bistecca has proven to be one of the very best, which compelled me to leave a review this time. The cocktails were great, with the bar going out of their way to mix something off menu per my wife's fancy. Then the appetizers of bruschetta and calamari were excellently prepared. For the main event, we had the larger Fiorentina for sharing last time and the Hanging Tender this time. Both were excellent! The Hanging Tender was especially true to its name and nearly melted in our mouths. We were too stuffed already, but managed to have some excellent gelato ice cream. Price is of course Singapore pricing... expensive compared to elsewhere but reasonable here! Overall a great place to visit for a relaxing time on holiday or business!
4
I love steak & have high expectation of it therefore I would say, Bistecca Tuscan reached my expectation. Of cos we can't compare to the freshness of the real Bistecca alla Fiorentina which I've had a few times in reputable restaurants in Tuscany, compared to many steakhouses we have in Singapore, it's thumbs up.Service wise, it can be warmer thou'
4
I have eaten here a few times and never left disappointed, the steak is wonderful and not overly priced considering the competition.I have never tried the signature t-bone, but have had the tenderloin and this was excellent beautifully cooked and melt in the mouth tender with lots of flavour. Italian friends of mine have also eaten here and report back very favourably. all in all a very good experience
3
We had a reasonable meal here. The food was well presented although the additional sides were a big disappointment. However, the cost did not reflect a dinner experience that had you coming away thinking that you had had an exceptional experience/meal. There was an air of snobbishness about the staff/service which almost had you feeling that you should be privaleged to be in their establishment. I definately felt that we had been "weighted up" and put into a category. Maybe they want the reputation of "high end, classy", but they need to remember who the customer is in the relationship. As "walk in" customers were shown to a table by a pleasant girl only to be bluntely informed by the waiter that we had five minutes to order as it was last orders at 21.30 on a Saturday night!.The steak was good if small for the $62 what was annoying was looking at the bill the morning after we had been charged $24 for a panzanella that we neither ordered or had. Not much money but when you bill comes to just under $600 for two, you dont expect such "mistakes" to be added on. Hang on, I've just realised that they missed of a glass of Dom at $35 so I'm $11 up!.Singapore is expensive, however, there are a lot of places that will give you a far better experience than the sort of money that this resturant charges. Maybe that is why this place was only about 20% full when we went.Note the 10% service charge before you add at tip to the bill

Steak is expensive in Singapore and so is red wine. However...we had a great evening in Bistecca and the food was really excellent. "Hanging Tender" recommended in particular and all washed down with moderately expensive Tuscan red. Good side orders and delicious ice cream to finish with. Valet parking available and the restaurant has a good feel and ambience
5
I have been to Bistecca at least half a dozen times for meals, drinks, and events. It has a great atmosphere where it has the feel of a classy high end restaurant, but not super quiet and formal where you'd feel uncomfortable. I have always had a great time at Bistecca. The most recent visit was just a casual dinner with some friends last month.While Bistecca is known for the steak and they are excellent, but they have a great selection of appetizers, sides and desserts as well. The bruschetta was unforgettable, a must try. The asparagus and gnocchi was great, everything is well prepared and cooked to our liking. There is a bit of a wait for the rib-eye, but it comes out hot with various sauces and you can also ask for this special mustard, which goes well with the steak. The meat is juicy with some fat in it, which makes it quite tasty. There is also a nice wine selection to go with the steak. A variety of dessert options are available after the meat, all are very good, the doughnut is interesting. The staff at Bistecca is generally very friendly and responsive and the bartender can make some interesting cocktails upon request. The food is pricey, but it is on par with other similar restaurants in Singapore as you get what you pay for. I would definitely go back to Bistecca when I have my next steak craving

We had high expectations having read all the reviews. Had three starters which were good but not exceptional, mains thethe t bone sharing steak which was very fatty - some parts were chewy and some very tasty, the tenderloin which was very good and 2 desserts which were again ok but nothing special. I think if you go you need to pare your expectations. The steak is good but not better than many restaurants in Singapore. I think the literature about themSpending a year to find the best meat is more of a marketing gimmick than reality. It's just too expensive for the quality. $500 for 3 without wine. I probably would not go back because I don't feel it's worth theMoney
4
BTSH's location and site is appealing and offers a casual yet stylish backdrop for lunch and dinner events. As antipasti, we tasted the bruschetta (SGD 18++ for two small slices), tartar di tonno (SGD 24++ for some 80 grams) and the roasted scallops (SGD 24++). Everything was perfect in presentation and of high quality. The tartar and bruschetta were excellent, the scallops too bland and unexciting. As mains we took the entry-level grass-fed wagyu-angus ribeyes (SGD 58++/400 gr.) and striploins (SGD 48++/300 gr.), which - like all the other steaks they offer on the menu - only come with a selection of sauces (of which the porcini was particularly delicious). Sides are optional, which means that all of us who are not pure carnivores will need to fork out another SGD 10 - 15++ per side-dish. While I may have lost touch with restaurant prices in Singapore over the last two years of absence, I thought the prices were over the top, especially when considering that all of us felt that the meat was fibrous and tough... although the taste and cooking was perfect. The wine list offers ample choices - especially for fans of Italian growths - but expect no bargains. Cocktails are only served in the evening

This particular occasion was a business evening meal. Restaurant plit into 2...smaller eating area as you walk in...then you walk past the open view kitchen where you can see the chefs at work...in the rear a section with another 15 or so tables .We are not the easiest buch to keep satisfied. I cant really fault the staff. Enrico conducted the table very well.It is a steak place so fish wasn't even considered. The table had a some simple starters that were of offer and a mixed order of meats. Decent selection of wines on offer. I settled for the boneless Ribeye. Others did a combo. and one did the monterous T bone! Meat is grilled plain....as good meat should be. You wanna add salt or a sauce...that's your perogative.I have to say my ribeye wasn't up there with the best steak I've had.. It wasn't particularly tender. But the T bone on the table was another level. Very tasty meat. Perfectly cooked and very tender. The necessarily veg etc were all well presented...cooked to your liking and tasty,Good atmosphere to the place and obviously popular. As I say... I was rather disappointed with my meat but it will not put me off returning to give it a second chance . For me it gets the vote on location...meat ( let's hope I get better next time Enrico ) and atmosphere. Good for business and couples. Without doubt Bistecca is worth a visit
2
The steak was blackened on the outside and raw in the middle and medium around the edges. I am almost certain they didn't use any seasoning (not even salt) on the steak. It came with 4 sauces. 1 of which was supposed to be a salsa verde but was more like purÃ©ed spinach. Their homemade katsup was good and they have a decent wine selection. Crazy overpriced for what you get. I can not wait to go back to the states and have a better steak dinner
5
I grew up 16 years in Argentina which is known for it's incredible beef, so when I say that the meat at Bistecca is exceptional, there is some power behind those words. I have been to Bistecca 3 times and have been impressed every time at the level of service as well as the quality of food right down to the scrumptious desserts! This place also has the right environment and personality..don't even feel like I'm in Singapore! Couldn't recommend it more
5
Went to Bistecca for a weeknight meal with friend and was greeted with warm and family staff. I like the decor with red and black theme and comfortable setting. It was hard to decide what to try first but the service staff recommended a few dishes that were just excellent! We had an appetizer and shared the huge florentine steak that was just so juicy and full of flavor. They also have a great selection of wine. It was a nice evening with my friend with great food and great ambience to just chat and relax. Excellent experience all around and will definitely go again
4
I had an enjoyable evening at Bistecca catching up with some friends. It was a good dining experience in all aspects - food, service, atmosphere, great company (my own). Firstly, the service was immaculate. The waiter knows his stuffs, and was even able to recommend a wine based on our very rudimentary description of taste preferences. We ended up with a Tuscany wine from the Chianti region, and it paired very well with my main courses. The main courses were of main sides with steak. And the slab of meat didn't disappoint. The interior of the restaurant was of dark tones on stripped-down walls, juxtaposed against a swanky bar and an open-view kitchen. Not entirely Italian, but modern/contemporary enough. I liked the location too, once a street of noisy pubs but the addition of the likes of Bistecca brought about some class to the area
5
Feeling in need of a pick-me-up, I headed to Bistecca in Mohammed Sultan Road & I certainly wasn't disappointed. They clearly know their meat here. The great disappointment about many steak restaurants is that their meat is not seared properly. Doing so ensures that a nice crust forms, trapping all those unctuous, umami meat flavours while underneath the meat is succulent & nicely pink. This is the hallmark of a great steak. I am happy to report that the chef at Bistecca executes the task of cooking steaks to an art.I arrived for lunch during a public holiday & for the hour plus that I was there, had the restaurant all to myself. The narrow space is furnished with a masculine elegance with animal skin rugs underfoot & dark wooden furniture throughout, enlivened with floral displays throughout in an all-white palette. My meal started with seared scallops served with a bread salad or panzanella, except that this was finely chopped as to become almost a chunk sauce on top of which sit the chunky scallops. My only criticism is that the scallops could have done with a tad more seasoning.The highlight was the steak & I chose the filleto of wagyu. It was cooked as ordered to a medium rare doneness & came dressed with a stalk of spring onion & a quartered red onion, both of which had been seared by the grill. There were two accompanying sauces, a mushroom one as well as a chunky tomato, both of which were made in-house. I preferred the mushroom as it went well with the side of sauteed mushrooms I ordered, which was served in its own cocotte or mini pot. The tomato was too sweet for my taste without the corresponding tang that would have balanced it off nicely. A glass of the house Barolo was a nice accompaniment as the fullness of the wine complimented the meat beautifully.The portions were just right & I still had room left for dessert. I settled for the chocolate mousse with poached pear, sidestepping the classic choice of tiramisu. I got a beautifully presented plate with a quenelle of intensely dark chocolate mouse which hit the spot as well as three slices of pear which had been poached in red wine. The pears were cooked just right & was the perfect foil for the chocolate along with the tartness of raspberry coulis which dotted the plate.I will definitely visit again as I understand the pastas are worth trying too. That day's special was home made pici with a tomato sauce & romano cheese but I don't think I was up to the task.Overall, kudos to the service team for the attentive service. I left a happy camper
5
It is clear the owners and operators of Bistecca love meat and they are highly knowledgeble about it. It translates to an amazing steak experience; the meat is of very high quality, and prepared beautifully. The wine list matches very well and gives you lots of choice across price points. Bistecca can go head to head with the top steak places in NYC or HK
5
I was impressed by the quality of the food and suggestions made by the host. Not only was the steak juicy, the pasta and assorted sides were very tasty. I definitely will make another trip back!
5
Went there with my wife and friend. We were looked after very well by the service and the Fiorentina was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. Highly recommend.
5
I checked out Bistecca from a friend referral. The environment was super cozy and nice and the staff were knowledgeable and friendly. If you're a steak rookie or a steak connoisseur, they've got you covered! I went with the Florentina, and it was steak-tastic!
5
There are lots of restaurants on Mohammed Drive, but Bistecca is a place you can take clients or celebrate with friends. The environment is not pretentious, but the service and food quality is upscale.
Favorite Appetizer: Rigatoni
Meats: Cuts are very nice
Desserts: Elegantly presented
5
Bistecca is one of those places that starts with the steak. Having been there a few times now, I can safely say the food quality is among the finest anywhere--not just in Singapore. The owners easily placed top priority on the food for the dining experience. Along with the fine food, the service and environment are also quite good. I found space to be slightly tight for a restaurant of this type, but it's still open enough for pleasant conversation with your friends. Perhaps the biggest danger is that you will end up feasting on the main course and sides before you have a chance to order their terrific desserts. That would be a shame
5
I gotta tell you, being from New York, the last place i expected to go in Singapore was a steakhouse.. because of work I ended up going to two... Singapore is that much of an international city.. Just came back and hope to go back again.. Anyway, so i went to one at the casino with clients which was OK but pretentious and overpriced, then another one near Robertson Quay that was really chill, a place you could spend time with friends, clients, family etc.. Well, i was really impressed with the place.. Had a beer to start.. was pretty good since never had Italian beer before.. The appetizer i had was burrata cheese.. Sure it probably has some calories and fat, but it so delicious i almost licked the plate. The steak i ordered with my friend was the "Costata".. was cooked medium and to perfection.. And this was the "surprise" i guess coming from Manhanttan where the excellent steakhouses are all over the place.. In any case, it came with some sauces which i didn't use because the steak held up on its own.. We both raved.. We didn't even talk while we were eating since it was that good.Oh yeah, had the rigatoni with meatballs in it.. that dish was great.. that creamy cheese (forgot what it was).. Definitely recommend.The sides we had creamed spinach and roast potatoes.. Now the spinach unfortuantely is nothing to write home about.. Sorry, i'm just not a fan of that.. But the roast potatoes! It was great.. i ate it with my hands, yes, probably very caveman/uncivilized of me to do but it felt more like french fries from a good joint.. but without all that oil.. and they had some homemade tomato (ketchup?) something like that which went well with it, or without.. Dessert, i didn't eat since i don't eat too many sweets.. But my friend liked the tiramisu.. Had some Chianti wine.. and some mixed cocktails (yes they have a bar)... and my night was set.. Oh yeah, they have some pretty hostesses.. Enjoy
5
This restaurant is definitely one of the best steakhouse I've ever been. The quality of food is amazing, together with the appetizer and wines, you can surely enjoy a great night with friends here. Oh, the dessert is also super super nice, i would give my highest recommendation for whoever wants to visit this resto, and i'm sure you won't regret :

As a Belgian citizens, we know our meat. We are called ‘meat eaters’. Whenever we visit a city, we search for a steak house… When I read on internet ‘Italian restaurant specialise in steaks’, I found this a daring challenge for our Italian friends, so we decided to try it out. It was so good that we went back again the next day. The steak was the best I have had in a very long time, cooked as requested to perfection. As for the wine, we gave them a budget and our preferences, the choice was theirs to make. We were not disappointed. Kimberley, a trained sommelier made an excellent choice. Her husband Francesko cooks with passion, no doubts about it. For dessert, had the rhubarb. Eriko who manages the restaurant will treat you as a VIP when you arrive and like family when you leave. They honoured Italian gastronomy by proving 1) Italy is more than just pasta 2) Italy knows what hospitality means. We will be back. Kind regards, Stefaan-Tehmin
5
This is a great place to enjoy Italian food cooked by a genuine Italian chef from Tuscany. It is a nice respite from Asian food when holidaying in Singapore. The menu covers most areas but their speciality is steak, cooked just as you would get in a top restaurant in Firenze. The wine list covers a huge range of price points but I recommend you try one of the wines from Tuscany producer Avignonesi
4
Went there with a few colleagues. The steaks were excellent. They really are like the steaks you get in Florence. The sides especially the potatoes were wonderful. Ordered a 2007 Italian red which was fantastic.We didn't try any of the other dishes.Not a romantic place but an honest restaurant that doesn't try too hard.Overall I rate this place
4
I love restaurant with good food and good wines. I like my experience there and the service staff were friendly and they even gave a complimentary glass of wine from the ones I had ordered before the bottle. The steak was good,juicy and tender,all I wanted
5
Well, I went there with my partner on a Friday night. Even though we did not have a reservation and despite the fact of being really busy we were welcomed like regular customer (it was our first time). The service took its time to find a table for us and recommended to wait at the bar for a few minutes and to have aperitive there. Well, the drink was served fast and just 3 minutest after the drink we were brought to our table. Recommendations were given for food and beverage but we decided to choose on our own. We had a gread Burata some grilled vegatables and a Scamone Steak paired all with some wine by the glas (which was a real good Chianti). Overall, everything great...the first visit made us already regular customers. Great Ambiance, professional service and even better food. Surely one of the Top 5 restaurants in Singapore
5
I was lucky enough to have some time for steak, during my reason stay in Singapore. We went to the Bistecca Tuscan Restaurant and it was really great. Many of the typical steak restaurants around the world leave out the rest of the meal, but here we were able to have the liver pate and Bruschetta.Fantastic.Because it was for lunch, we were only able to test one bottle of red with the meal, but they also have a fantastic wine selection to go with the awesome beef
5
The Bistecca was a great experience. the quality of meat was excellent.... Tender, testy and cooked like a speak shall be cooked. Best meat I had for a very long time.The atmosphere is nice and the personnel very friendly. I will return next time I stay in Singapore again.Highly recommended
4
I have 3 gripes. First, there was no free valet parking on the weekday evening that I was there. In fact there was no valet at all. This was contrary to what the website said. Secondly, just like what some reviewers have said, the bar area was too close to some tables. The drinkers at the bar ensured that you would not be able to have a quiet dinner. The next time the restaurant renovate, something should be done about this. Thirdly, it was supposed to be happy hours before 7 pm which meant 1-for-1 beer. I had a Peroni but the 2nd bottle never arrived (did anyone notice?)The great thing is that the food was fantastic. The steak was the best that I had for a long time. The waitress who served us (pardon me - I did not get her name) was knowledgeable and friendly. A few of the waiters though appeared a bit sulky.Yes, overall this is a place I would recommend and that I would return to
5
We love this restaurant! Delicious food, great wine, and very sweet staff. The Fiorentina is wonderful and worth the money. Nice selections of high quality italian foods. Its in a great location too, not to far from a nice walk and other happenings around Singapore. Can't wait to book there again
4
Had dinner here with a friend on a Friday. We had our pre-dinner drinks outside, which has a nice atmosphere. Inside a tad too cold for my liking but decorated nicely. We had a burrata with a stack of tomatoes and eggplant to share and went for the Costata. The meat was very good and done to perfection. For desert we asked the Chef to do a special for us and yes, the Zabaione was delicious! Same goes for the Brunelo, excellent wine and a very good selection indeed. A definite must repeat
5
This is wonderful & luxury restaurant . Atmosphere is cozy and romantic. Good for couple, businesses and family. I dont usually like Western food but I loved their steak which was tender and potato tasty. My daughter loved home made pasta very much. It was different from other Italian restaurants. Lovely martini which is very relaxing. Staffs are friendly. It was perfect (Food & Service) for dinner .... Don't wait must try it so you can see the difference

Ladies who lunch are strange breed : treat them well and watch your revenue grow often in direct relation to the way they've been charmed; treating them badly or ignoring them is just plain foolish : they move in groups, they talk, they recommend, they bring the family, spread the word and they spend money! Lunch with 11 others of my breed at Bistecca today was just average and at $38 ++ for the three course lunch menu it was no bargain as the competition out there is fierce to attract us. With no choice of starter we were dished a plate of warm, thick pale green soup - the promised fish soup had turned into a rather pedestrian broccoli rendition devoid of flavour - 24 hands reached out for the salt & pepper grinders and plates went back to the kitchen unfinished. The mains were one pasta dish short, strange for an Italian eatery and we were offered a choice of rump steak with roast potatoes and more broccoli, chicken with red & yellow peppers, a hamburger and a vegetarian pasta which was little more than fusili with tomato sauce ... We asked the kitchen to perhaps replace the missing pasta dish with an alternative which was not vegetarian, a simple request in a restaurant which had 6 other pasta dishes on their a la carte menu and a half empty restaurant. A waiter returned to refuse the request while the owner hovered in the background and offered no explanation! Back to our lunch choices, with little flavour of Italy or the Med none of the dishes were either delicious or inspirational : we could have been chowing down at any average diner for a fraction of the cost and probably a heartier portion. Dessert was one ball of lemon ice cream. The brigade service was fine but would probably be stretched with a full restaurant and it was a shame that the owner/manager could do nothing more to encourage business than to mutter 'was everything OK' as he sailed past us without pausing for the reply : but don't worry, we'll let our friends know

Have been twice and first time was superb service, atmosphere and food; we went on a week night the second time we went was on the weekend and the service wasn't quite so sharp and we seemed to have the trainee staff, food was good alike first time, would definitely go in the week rather than the weekend
