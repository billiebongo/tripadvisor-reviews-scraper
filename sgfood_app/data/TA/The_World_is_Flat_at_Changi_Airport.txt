Really awesome breakfast dishes. If you're lucky enough to be there during breakfast hours, you must not give it a miss. And for every other time, the beers of craft will do just fine as well.

Waiting for a plane. Picked this one out.
Disregarded the reviews about price.
Good burgers and a nice range of draft beers.
It wasn’t busy here so the service was fine.
Happy to stop here again if I ever pass through again.

Was thinking about a hamburger here, but the prices are sky high, had a pint draft beer instead, 19 SD, Wich is well above sky high prices. Better buy a tin pint in a news paper stand, 6 SD.

There are about a dozen or so fast food outlets in several areas of Terminal 1 which serve generally fairly heavy unhealthy food...not our choice before getting on a long haul flight.Their main offerings are a range of burgers, including two vegetarian offerings, served on in-house baked buns. Burgers are on the smaller size ( which is fine with us) and were tasty without being too heavy.Bar has a good selection of craft beers, spirits and wines by the glass or bottle.At S70 it's fairly expensive but haven't been to an airport yet where prices are chea

Firstly, the staff are lovely and really cool. I was served by Kelly who was efficient and really nice. The coffee was not great but drinkable. The breakfast plate was a great price at 13$ and done its job. I will definitely be back to sample some of the beers on tap. The "sharkinator IPA" has me intrigued.Cool and chic place I would definitely recommend, but get your coffee at the coffee bean

Had the pastrami sandwich. Bread was fresh. Entire combination, yummy! I washed it down with two cocktails - Dragonfruit Daiquiri as well as Spiced Rum Sour. Both were equally good. The dehydrated dragonfruit slice garnishing the first cocktail was a taste sensation. Recommended if you like sweet and sour. Prices are the same as the high end bars downtown. So I wasn't perturbed. Enjoyed a nice banter with the two friendly female staff. Helped else the fact that I was the only female drinker amongst a crowd of men. The male patrons are well behaved though. So no issue there.

"The world is flat" is my favourite place when I need a drink, a big smiling welcome, and pub grub while waiting for my flight in terminal 1 at Changi Airport.The staff is extremely lovely and attentive, they prepare some tasty pub grub - highly recommend the veggie pizza - and the wine selection is surprising and good! I actually appreciate that the menu states the price including the service charge, and even though it is on the high end, nothing surprising for an airport. And i feel the quality of products and service kind of make up for it.Looking forward to be back!

Spent a very pleasant hour here when connecting flights. It is a very nice bar with very friendly staff and about 8 crafts beers, IPA's and stouts on tap. Really enjoyed it but I can't giver it ore than three stars because of its appallingly high prices even by Singapore standards and even though I know airports are always expensive. It's nice though, but make sure the wallet is well packed

Killing time became very expensive! Mediocre tiny pizza for about A$10 and apple crumble cider about A$10. Red wine was the killer, from memory around A$16 a small glass. If you're looking for a quiet corner and don't mind spending a few dollars then this will suit
