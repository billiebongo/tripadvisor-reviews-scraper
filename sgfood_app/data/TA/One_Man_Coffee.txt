Free parking spaces available, friendly and helpful staff. Good food & nice ambience. It’s good to bring friends and have a long chat for the afternoon.

Make sure you order their cup of magic when you are there. The place is abit small though, make it difficult to have private conversations without the people beside you hearing.

Had yummilicious cheese toast here. Loved it. A small cafe which is welcoming and open early for breakfast: Ave prices and friendly staff.

Food: Average
Price: Average (about S$20 per pax)
Atmosphere: Chic and cool place
Service: Good
Food wise, like any other western cafe, well almost. Had pasta. Their coffee is great though.

This morning we had a grad breakfast. The very good coffee and tea and also the dishes were yummy. A good please if you want to have a european style breakfast but in a different and tasty way!
5
I came here while waiting for my car to be serviced. Ordered a latte and a Danish pastry. I like them. I sat here for a while. It was a very hot afternoon. Though I couldn't feel the aircon, the 2 ceiling fans kept the cool. The aircon was turned on by the way. I would come here again. The chairs are wooden, they are not the most comfortable but I could do work on my computer. Not sure about lazing here for a chat

Went to this coffee place for breakfast as a change from local food with my parents. Industrial Chic decor as like many cafes in Singapore these days. They have 2 different roast that day. One from a local roaster and the other from Australia. We went for the Australian blend. It was a bit strong and slightly acidic but not bad. Couldn't taste the chocolate and caramel overtones as described. Breakfast was not back we had 2 big breakie. The maple glazed bacon was lovely. The sausage although meaty feels dry outside...tasted like it has been in the freezer too long. Can't really taste the sour dough bread.Otherwise, not a bad coffee place to go for breakfast..Price is a bit expensive but average with most boutique coffee shops today...Tough competition in a saturated cafe market and me too coffee shops. Worth a try

Decor was normal cafe-ish but still nice. Small and quaint. Concrete walls and industrial in look, it's the run by the mill cafe design.Staff were friendly. Smiles and willing to have light banter and that is always good. Some cafe staff behave like they r some kind of supermodel with nose up high so it's breath of fresh air to be in the company of friendly people.Coffee was good MD served at the temp that it's meant to be served... Dat is not piping hot. Nice balance of everything and it gave me a hefty smile after the 1st sip.Food was wow oh wow. Good awesomeness and portion was just about right, not too much not too little, my French toast banana thingy was orally satisfying. *Pls rid your mind of filth*Pricing is fair! One of the more affordable cafes in sg and totally worth it. In a nutshell, come on by. Don't b bothered by the potential difficulty of getting a parking lot, that's what the upcoming ruling is for next year anyway. Do come by for the great coffee, cute and friendly staff and legit good food.

I keep coming here almost on a weekly basis since i have discovered this place a few months ago. Simply because the french toast with mascapone cheese and berries jam is to die for. Best i have ever eaten. Also, i love the axil coffee. Sometimes i need to have 2 cups! Nothing beats great coffee and toast for brunch, especially on the weekends
4
Went there for a quiet coffee to do some work and enjoyed the coffee as well as the fact that the place offers both free wifi and power sockets for business users. The only slight gripe is that the chairs could have been a tad bit more comfortable, but i guess they do not want customers to hang out the whole day at the place, so no big complaints there
5
Absolutely love this place. They really get their coffee spot on and do well with the breakfast offerings too. A side of bacon is a must to accompany just about everything on their menu. A regular spot for us and also catching up with mates.
5
Love their coffee! strong and aromatic! If you like it stronger, do try their Magic
There's lots of food to choose but their Gashouse Egg is the best!
3
Great food, awesome onsen eggs and mushroom, nice ambience and convenient location. Definitely a good place to spend time at.
5
One Man Coffee is the perfect choice for a weekend lazy brunch, or for me, after a good morning run at Macritchie Reservoir. They serve great coffee, and their staff are very polite and friendly. Great place to hang out with your loved ones!
5
I've gone to their different outlets in Singapore and am happy to report that the latte is consistently good. no complaints there. And I've developed a soft spot for their almond croissant too -- especially when lightly heated up. go for the small one for a start.
5
Very good long black coffee, which did not disappoint. I highly recommend their Gashouse Egg (i.e. egg-in-hole in toast bread) which matches well with their coffee.Pricey but if you're ought to start your day on a positive groove, then it's worth a stop for a relaxing breakfast.
3
On the outside the place says GarÃ§ons, on the inside it refers to One Man Coffee. Go figure.Very good brew of coffee. They seem to know the secret.The croissant with egg scramble was quite tasty, crunchy.The chicken burger on the other hand was bad! Old grease used to overly battered fat chicken.The pasta at the neighbors' table looked and smelled very good too
4
A small coffee house in this part of town, not far from the reservoir/ lake. I tried an aromatic South American blend of coffee roasted in Melbourne, served by a friendly local barrista, who was pretty knowledgeable about his coffee! Well served and not burnt at all. The menu looked pretty good, and a family with a small child were enjoying pasta and a good looking brioche toast
4
Recently the cafe had updated its menu with new items such as XL crispy chicken burger and Furikake Mushroom pasta. Order was taken at counter with only cash and NETS payment accepted.Sriracha Pork Belly Burger ($15)served with sweet potato friesThe pork belly was fatty with a texture similar to soft bone, although I was expecting a melt in a mouth fatty part with a crispy crust. The burger was not as spicy as expected. It was not messy to eat the burger. The fries was lacking of crispiness.Coffee Soda ($6) It was a glass of soda, accompanied with a glass of espresso. Just add the espresso into the soda before drinking. It tasted like soda drink with a coffee aftertaste. Quite refreshing for a hot day

There are so many places to choose from.. but this place stands out for its genuinely good food, coffee (of course) and service. The baked eggs cocotte, french toast and kaya croissant is particularly outstanding. Coupled with good and attentive service, you have a place you would like to frequent. Parking is a hassle but its worth it
4
Just felt like coffee after lunch in the neighbourhood and never been to this one. We had a slice of cake which they called Onde-onde and pretty much tasted like it. It was good... The other cake was chocolate with actual hazelnut. Looked good and moist enough... might try next time!We ordered flat white too. They have good coffee but too bad the hot coffee was not hot...Nice enough staff, washroom needs to be cleaned more though..

If you run out of places to have a fix of coffee along Thomson Road, you can try this place. However, it's neither fancy nor fantastic and nothing on the menu really stands out. Staff need to work on their EQ too especially when it comes to dealing with customers with young children and they need to work on clearing the tables faster
4
Heard a lot about the cafe and finally went there for breakfast. Parking is definitely challenging. Parked along private housing instead. It's pretty small with a seating capacity of about 20pax but there are still some seats outside. Food is fantastic. My husband had big berkkie at $15 while I had the truffle ham & cheese croissant at $8. Truffle is perfect for the croissant, such great aroma coming out from the first bite, simply delicious! With double shot flat white, this boost the morning. My only wish is for it to be at a place more convenient. Too far to make the effort frequently..

One Man Coffee (OMC) serves really good coffee. You can be sure that each cup served has been carefully poured by a skillful barista, who is passionate about what they do. One of my favourite things to do on my day off is to drop by OMC (whether it's their Upper Thomson, Serangoon Garden or recently opened Bukit Timah) branch and have a nice coffee and brunch over a good book. The staff are really friendly and service is great. The coffee is top notch, very well poured by baristas who are trained in the art and who know their stuff. Their food is also really good. Not your average cafe brunch food, but unique menu. The vibe of the place is also really nice; it's like your hangout joint, where it kinda makes you feel like you're in one of the Melbourne cafes

Was here after a long walk at Macritchie on a school holiday Monday. The cafe has quite limited seating so we had to sit out at first but the staff offered to get us shifted in once a table cleared which happened right after I had placed order. My friend had a pork belly burger while I had the mushroom one. Tasty and reasonable portions for the price. Flat white was good though it did take awhile for the drinks to come. The tables are quite near so it was easy to listen in on others unintentionally. Though they closed at 5pm, they were kind enough to let us linger a little over and nobody rushed us out. Will return again
4
Part cafe part pizza. I like it because you know the consistency of the coffee and the fact that they don't randomly get some undergraduate part timer to do your daily fix. In terms of aesthetics and ambience, I prefer the one at One North. But hey, coffee matters! 5/

Was looking forward to a great brunch but was disappointed, largely because of the limited menu for brunch. Ended up ordering a croissant which was nice but way too expensive. The saving grace was the coffee was really good! So if you are just looking for a great cuppa, this is the place

Happen to chance upon this small little cafe, i would say that the atmosphere is one of my favorite. Rustic and kinda laid back. Coffee we ordered a flat white and a hot chocolate, its drinkable but not world best. Brioche French Toast was really a single piece of bread with some walnuts, for $10. Its honestly delicious and nice, but not able to fill my tummy, and its $10. The Big Brekkie, a toast, 2 onsen eggs, candied bacon, butter mushooms, baby spinach, roasted cherry tomatos for $15. Again its yummy, the onsen eggs are spectacular, bacon nicely doned.We left with our taste buds satisfied, but tummy half filled. so in total i spend about $35 on breakfast, its delicious, and i went a little further for teochew porridge which cost me $7 to fill up my tummy.

I stumbled upon this place by accident, but I really liked the food!The ambience was really nice, and the staff were very friendly. The waiting time was a tad long, but definitely worth it.My favourite was the sauteed mushrooms - it was so good that my friends and I ordered another serving of it!Portions are very generous as well

- A nice shophouse location in the Thomson area, though the vicinity will be rather messy withthe MRT line construction wok going on- Good service.- Food (e.g. the grilled cheese sandwich) is made and presented well, and the coffee is the way I like it.- The flagship outlet among a handful of branches around the island, and (if I remember) one in Johor Bahru

Haven't been to one man for a while but it's coffee remain top notch! And I am really glad that am
Back today for their famous brioche French toast and gashouse eggs! Damn the bombz! Love it. Super cool place!

My wife and I came here after reading reviews on tripadvisor looking for a nice place for brunch. We were extremely disappointed with the food. I ordered the Big Brekkie ($15) and she ordered the Baby Spinach salad ($12) both of which had really tiny portions. I did not like the dressing at all and the bacon was one of the worst I have ever had. I doubt I will go back again. Did not order the coffee - may be that's the only thing good there
5
Amazing food and very good service.Our favorite cafe in Singapore by far. We love everything they have on the menu, the food and the coffee is really good value for money. This is definitely our go to cafe whenever we go home to Singapore. ☺

I visted One Man Coffee on Sunday, 27 Dec 2015 morning with 4 other friends. It was our first time visiting this place. We are suprised by the great service provided. The staff took the effort to explain to us on the menu, what's the more popular items and the special for the day. We ordered the big breakfast, french toast and pastry. Everything is in good portion and right taste. Not too oily, not too buttery and not too salty. Seeing so many cafes opening up in Singapore, I must say that One Man Coffee got almost everything right (i.e. food, service, price etc). I would surely recommend my friends to this place. Thank you for the great sunday. with regards,Audre

This was one of the few cafes that open early, and we have been here a few times.The Gashouse Eggs was full of cheesy goodness.The thick and fluffy french toast was excellent, with the lovely, slightly tart jam.We tried Big Brekkie before, but unfortunately the eggs were overcooked.The matcha and vanilla cake was lovely, and not overly sweet.The matcha latte was quite milky, but still had that slight hint of bitterness.I also like the Pear-fect Oolong (Allerines premiun tea series); ask for the tea menu to see the full list of tea available.Coffee was above average, and definitely one of the better ones in this area.Service was alright, abit of confusion at times, but in general, the staff were always friendly. You can ask them for the WiFi password

I tend to go out for brunch most Saturdays and Sundays and I think the quality is typically pretty high in Singapore. Then I came to one man coffee - 2 things in particular really annoyed me 1) the food portions are tiny - i ordered the feta salad, I got a cereal bowl with leaves and some tiny cubes of feta. I was hungry after so we went somewhere after (have your customers leave hungry is surely the worst thing a brunch place can do) 2) the service was atrocious.. No one cares about customers in this place our food kept getting delivered to other tables and we had to ask for our drinks 3 times. One positive thing was that the coffee was OK. That's the only reason I can imagine someone would give this place a good rating. Anyways I'm never going there again. Too many other amazing options.

Was at this cafe, the One Man Coffee (@onemancoffee) on Upper Thompson Road for a meetup and experimented their signature Magic coffee on my guests. Two of them started buzzing after a few sips! Hilarious! So, looking for a hyper hangout, have some Magic in your life.The cafe isn’t big and there’s also some limited alfresco space but it creates a cozy atmosphere for mainly local patrons. This is definitely a local hidden gem out of the beaten path of tourists. Upper Thompson Road is usually out of the way for many visitors to Singapore but it highlights the current boom in coffee culture in the city where everyone is levelling-up their game to stay ahead

Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast with my partner.The place is not that hard to find - it is just a few minutes walk away from the nearest bus stop. The place was small - indoor seating could probably hold around 20 pax, and outdoor seating another 10-12 pax or so.The first thing I noticed about One Man Coffee (OMC) is that they are different from other cafes that have sprung up in Singapore in the recent years in terms of its operating hours. OMC opens from 9am (all round the week) as compared to other cafes that open only around midday and operate until late night.Real coffee is meant to be enjoyed as a breakfast/morning drink - and I am glad that OMC has not followed in the footsteps of these "lazy cafes" that opens late in order to cater for lazy young people. Thumbs up!Moving forward, we ordered:- Big Brekkie ($13.00)- Brioche French Toast ($10.00)- Iced Chocolate ($6.00)- Long Black ($4.00)The Big Brekkie was pretty decent with 2 x "6-minute eggs" (soft-boiled egg in other words). The ham slice was thick and dry (hard to chew), though it was not that salty. The bread was of a good enough texture, though dry as well. Nothing amazing there.The Brioche French Toast was spongy and soft on the inside. The bit of berry jam they provided however was kinda disappointing - it was just a small scoop the size of a teaspoon.The iced chocolate came, and you could taste the cocoa powder in it - which is a good thing as compared to some other cafes that makes chocolate drinks by constituting it with Hershey's chocolate syrup.And last came the Long Black. Alas this contributed to the downfall. The Long Black was too sour (acidic) - perhaps a sign of the beans being over-roasted, or having too much Arabica content (more Robusta please!). I had a look around to see what other people were having, but I saw that they were all having lattes or cappuccinos (with milk).Having seen all the other TripAdvisor reviewers comment on how solid their coffee is, was the reason I gave this place a try. And I was sorely disappointed in their coffee. And disappointed in the other reviewers who gave me false hopes of finding the perfect, solid coffee (no milk please - coffee with milk is just so wrong if you want to experience the taste of coffee).To summarize, my bill came to $33.00 for 2 pax (a little expensive IMHO). OMC is simply good for being an early breakfast location (as compared to the other lazy cafes), and probably nothing else.Do remember to order your coffee with milk though - don't attempt to be a coffee connoisseur and take it without any milk

Came here on a Saturday morning. Wasn't very busy but they forgot my order. Service is below mediocre. Waiters lack proper customer service practice - try to avoid eye contact and clump together with one another to chat. But coffee is good. And the highly recommended brioche French toast did live up to expectations other than the fact that they were so stingy with their homemade berry jam

After a hour of run around the Macritchie Reservoir, I was craving some heavy breakfast with coffee. After a quick search, I found One Man Coffee. Glad that they open at 9! Definitely a plus point! Stepping in at 9.05 am, I was the first customer of the day. After watching me helping myself with the door and the pram, the waitress rushed to help me out. I requested a highchair for my daughter and the waitress promptly brought it and cleaned it up before place it by the table. Another brownie point (:The menu wasn't an extensive one but it had a good variety of breakfast dishes. I ordered Brioche french toast and a glass of Orange juice. The French toast had two slices of thick brioche bread subtly dusted with caster sugar, candied walnuts, fresh cream and berries compote. I loved the concept of using brioche. It was the soft, fluffy and buttery. The fresh cream and berries compote went great with the toast. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and it tasted great. I had a flat white once I was done with my meal and it was great too. Overall, the food was great and reasonably priced, excellent coffee and friendly staff
