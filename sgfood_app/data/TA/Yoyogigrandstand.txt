This place serves good fusion Japanese food. They are creative and modify some of the food in their own style. Will come back again.

Have been to this restaurant couple of times. Love their omakase menu and sake selection. Good value for lunch set, dinner menu can be customized according to your preference.

There is a small room here in otherwise a small restaurant so it's possible to have a good business meeting. Waiter is very attentive so service is good. We had the truffle menu - very nice.

Located inside the turf city. Hard to find if you don't notice as there's a piece of white wall outside the restaurant. Serve by claim trained Chef .. Edwin with friendly waitress. You can chose to sit over a big counter but KM my view is rather too big and Long by Japanese standard. Food quality is great and the amber jack fish served with truffle oil was great. You can use their 2 private dining room and lots of sake and wines to choose from . Price reasonable but on the high side at this part of singapore and its location.

Having dined at many Japanese restaurants around the world, Yoyogi is by far one of my favourite. The food is always fresh, delicious and presented exceptionally. This, coupled with the excellent service, makes for an unbeatable dining experience! The chefs are also very willing to accommodate to various dietary requirements and always check with diners before they begin preparing the meals. I like the small serving sizes as they are bursting with flavour and means you can try up to 10 different dishes. I also enjoy the restaurant's atmosphere - the bar dining allows you to observe the preparation of food and begin conversations with the chef(s). I think this is a unique and fun part of the dining experience at Yoyogi. Regardless of whether you are going on a quiet dinner date, or with a larger group, Yoyogi is able to cater to all your needs. For the quality and service provided at this establishment, the pricing is quite reasonable. A must visit while you are in Singapore

We come here often as it's our favorite Japanese restaurant. My son who is living in Japan must dine here each time he is back into Singapore even though he lives in Japan. We're never disappointed here and proud to bring friends here. Every friends enjoy having meal here.

I'm sorry to say this despite the friendly TV-star chef and all but this can hardly be considered authentic Japanese food. It's like the kitchen sink version of what many think is Japanese food. One might as well eat spam sushi ala Hawaii. No wonder no Japanese worth his salt will eat there. Genuine sushi chefs will cry when they see what is being served here. But willing seller, willing buyer I suppose. It is unfortunate there are so many diners in Singapore who are not discerning at all. For authentic Japanese food, look elsewhere. This is a place for the clueless and the easily-impressed

Small entrance at the inside of Turf City leads to a very roomy and nice What looks understated restaurant!Wait staff were friendly, attentive and willing to serve. Guess it helps that the owners were there to operate as well as serve. Edwin & Wife do a lovely job to manage the place!Food is pretty decent. Food presentation is not top class wow but the flavor is certainly not lacking. Its also not the cheapest place to dine in, and their pricing puts them in the upper brackets in the upper mid end range of Japanese restaurants available here in Singapore. You do pay for convenience (if you live around this area), and quality. Sake range was also pretty good! i enjoyed the evening, but felt perhaps a little hard done by the price range

What looks like a small and understated restaurant with a narrow entrance turned out to be a really nice dining experience.Wait staff were very friendly and proper. They were also very attentive and willing to accommodate dietary requests. Staff were equipped with sound product knowledge too. As most of the seats are at the counter, the restaurant owner is thoughtful enough to cater drawers for bag storage. Food's fantastic here. From simple looking appetizers which tasted heavenly to fresh seafood on tasty seaweed flavoured rice, and totally not fishy tuna consommÃ© and perfectly grilled beef bowl with truffle seaweed rice, the dining experience was quite extraordinary. I would definitely dine here again
