Cedele makes some of the finest salads and juices, with wide selection of fresh veggies and proteins. Beet root juice is really good. Prices are very reasonable too.

Food was good, but no more in paragon. I like patronize when I around that corner almost every month, but have to miss their economy big breakfast.

cakes, pasta, sandwiches, tarts. You name it, they have it. I frequent this place, and absolutely love their teas and cakes.

Very good mall, has everything you need and staff are helpful. It's got around 6 floors and has all the fashion labels one could possibly want. Some places are more expensive than others so you must just keep an eye out for that.

After discovering any alcoholic drinks around the area of our hotel were extremely expensive, we found Cedele cafÃ© by Bakery Depot within our own hotel complex - Swissotel the Stamford in Singapore. The food is wonderful and so cheap compared to other things around Singapore, and they are very conscious of the quality of their produce and their meals. They also had delicious fruit juice blends, in particular the beetroot one. Meals included burgers, yummy salads, chicken and beef dishes and beautiful pasta dishes and Asian dishes. What a great fin

After hours of travelling and needing to find a quiet, unobtrusive spot to have a quick yet tasty and filling dinner, Cedele was the perfect option.I had dinner here on 2 occasions and in both instances, the food was tasty and hit the spot. The portions were a good size and they were flavour packed and suited the budget I was working with.What also stood out was that many tourists over-looked this gem so it was a quiet space to reflect on the day :

I planned to have a coffee at Cedele while waiting for my wife to join me for breakfast following her routine checkup at Mt. E. - a simple plan.Unfortunately, our plan went astray when she stumbled on an uneven surface and fell very hard while walking to Paragon after her appointment.Fortunately, an elderly local couple came to her aid, helped her to her feet, and guided her to Paragon, where she called me and I joined her and brought her to our table at Cedele. My wife was not only very shaken, but bruised and abraded, and the Cedele staff provided ice and a napkin so we could reduce her swelling, and a simple first-aid kit so we could cover her wounds. As she had not eaten breakfast, we ordered meals (which seemed quite nice), then paid and left for the Emergency Room to ensure that she hadn't broken anything (just a bad sprain, thankfully). Despite the fact that Cedele was busy, the staff were attentive and caring, and showed their concern and professionalism throughout.We thank the Cedele staff, and the local couple who helped my wife, from the bottom of our hearts

Another place that understands vegetarian food can be tasty, filling and flavourful! Cedele's soups are so good to eat, just served a tad too cold for my taste, and the unlimited bread is the perfect way to turn the soup into a filling meal. I do wish there was a cup vs. bowl option like they do in the US. Wonderful breads, beetroot burger is amazing and lovely desserts to take home

Just had lunch here after a visit to the paragon medical suites. The cafe is located just off the medical suites lift lobby. Convenient if you don't plan on running around too much. Have to agree that the sandwiches have become smaller and cutting the side salad makes the offering look a little sad (considering you are paying S$8+ for the sandwich). The coffee wasn't so great either.Service was fine though - all our orders (soup, salad and coffee) arrived promptly and our water was topped up several times without us asking. The Indian waiter who greeted us on arrival and took our order was very professional.Their strength is still with their own made bread (wholemeal in our case) and I quite enjoyed my BLT. The husband's ham and cheese sandwich was fine too; just a little on the small side.

Went for a sat lunch with friends. Was "greeted" by some rude waiter when we asked for a table of 6 asking whether we could tuck at an available corner table as we were rushing for time, he just brushed us off and said that will be tight (with a smug look). Asking us to wait for the bigger table.After being settled down and while a friend was ordering another waiter gave a smug attitude when my ftiend order a wrong item from menu.My chicken presto thin wrap was not fantastic at all, was not warm enough and my cheese not melted. For the $$$ paid, I would definitely expect some quality service and food.
