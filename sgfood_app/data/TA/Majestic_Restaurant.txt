Made reservation for a business lunch. Menu is specially choosen by the Chef himself. Everything is perfect. From Peking Duck to Abalone to Birds Nest. I will recommand this place for any family dinner or business lunch.
5
The ambiance of the restaurant and the service is also quite nice. Very consistent. We cant complain. Fresh food and great value
4
They will be moving to another location after this month. The food taste was great and was never expected to be that good. Keep up the good work and see them in their new location.
5
we are so exiting to have some good chinese food .
service was very good ..food taste was very nice ..
thank you so much for accomodate us in there busy schedule
appreciate

Were recommended to this restaurant by the team at hotel dorsett as this was a chinese restaurant with long history. The stir-fried noodles were excellent, so were the sweet and spicy pork, the steamed fish and the braised abalone. Service was somewhat rush as it was full house. The deserts were a letdown.In total, about 8000czk, decent value in the time and amount spend
4
We had a quick lunch. The menu is quite extensive - Chinese mainly. The food is good, although a bit on the pricy side for what you get. The restaurant is a separate business from the hotel, so you cannot charge to your room. It is not a very welcoming place, a bit tucked in the back of the hotel without windows
5
Without fail, be it a business, friends or family affair, this is one of the hot favourites, echoed by all I have entertained, from one to over 30 guests, over the last decade and more. Lunch or dinner sets promise to more than satisfy and excite every palate, regardless. Foie gras atop water melon, wasabi prawn, Peking duck atop... . Soup choices always warm the heart and again, without fail solicite only the best comments if not rave reviews. Main course of cod, halibut or rib eye is always pleasantly savoured and lobster or prawn noodles ... ahhhhh. Leaving the best for the last is the best dessert selections Over the years, I recently migrated from my all-time Favourite of avocado purÃ©e with a dollop of vanilla icecream and drizzle of Gula Melaka in a young Thai coconut to the most amazing new majestic concoction of Bubor Cha Cha - a must have however full you are. Kudos to the dessert Chef! The experience continues not only with the service but the ambiance and present location which unfortunately will be greatly missed by end May 2017. All are encouraged to make it there before they move to the financial district

Their service was friendly and attentive, from the time we made reservations (1 month prior), until the end of our meal.They were accommodating to allow a table of 12 so that we could invite 8 of our clients along, for our annual CNY Lo Hei lunch. They also created a delectable vegetarian menu.However, they were strict to require an immediate SGD300 deposit via credit card payment.We selected their Contentment menu which came with atlantic salmon lo hei plus 6 dishes, followed by 2 desserts (aiyu jelly with aloe vera, raw honey and kumquat which was refreshing) and deep-fried traditional nian gao (which was interestingly layered with yam and sweet potato).The other 6 dishes were: supreme bisque (which was a tasty thick soup, heartily flavoured with seafood delicacies), crispy prawns in wasabi dressing and salted egg yolk (fresh prawns in an interesting combination of 2 different sauces), abalone with dried oyster and black moss (the abalone was cooked to the right texture), steamed halibut fillet (beautifully tender and fresh fish), roasted Ireland silver hill duck (tasty and succulent, although I am not a fan of duck) and rice with chinese sausage.The generous portions were more than adequate for us.The vegetarian dishes were also well enjoyed by our guests.Overall, it was a pleasant dinning experience in the quaint lobby of this boutique hotel (New Majestic hotel) at Bukit Pasoh Road. Although it was the peak Chinese New Year Lo Hei lunch season, their food quality was still satisfactory, with good and efficient service
4
My family and I had our CNY 7th day lunch here for the 4th year this year and we continue to be delighted with the standard of food and service. The halibut was a nice change from the cod which most of us are not too keen about. Loved the lohei and its varied yummy condiments and the very fresh raw salmon. Nice thick carrot broth with seafood was something different and a little less rich. The Irish duck was a generous portion but we were not connoisseurs of the layer of fat under the skin. As usual the nian gao was a highlight for all of us - simply loved the taro and sweet potato sandwiching the nian gao which was crispy without being greasy. We will be back
4
There's three set menu to choose from for the CNY lunch, $98 per person, $138, and $148. we opted for the $98 menu. The food quality is quite good, portion is generous. Finding parking lot is tough during lunch hour. However, they have valet parking services.
3
This place used to be better. However standards have dropped with some hygiene issues in the past.
Can skip if you want.
5
Quality of food is great! Appreciate the free flow of drinks as well! Service was also attentive and prompt.
3
It was all right. People celebrating birthdays will get free longevity buns. I love the lobster noodles. But it is a dish for at least 3 people.
5
We were a family with 6 adults and 7 children. We got a private room with a waitress who was always present to tend to our needs. Service was prompt and polite, and the food was good.
5
We particularly enjoyed the combination of flavours without any compromise on the essence of Chinese cuisine. There was definitely no fusion confusion here. Ambience added to the whole dining experience. Presentation of the plates added to the whole eating experience. An absolute treat!
5
Have been going to this restaurant for many years and on every visit to Singapore. Love the fusion of Asian foods here. The private room if there are more than 4 is worthwhile for privacy.
5
it was the perfect place to entertain business partners or just to go for a good meal that won't burn a hole in your pocket.
4
Do not be deceive by the small restaurant, but they serve good food. Good ambient and nice plating of food. Love the claypot rice service.
5
Time of the year where I have to take clients out for Chinese New Year lunches and Majestic so far is my favorite. Been coming here for years and they have maintained their high standards of food preparation and service. Everything on the set menu was excellent.
5
They provided excellent service throughout our dinner and we were given complimentary longevity buns as it was my mum's 60th birthday. We started 1/2 hour late as my mum and brother were late and caught in the traffic jam although I reached earlier than the booking time. I was even given a room to dine in although I did not requested for it. I think the restaurant has taken the initiative knowing that my family will be there to celebrate my mum's birthday. She was very impressed with the food and service they have provided. All of us enjoyed our dinner and has an awesome Christmas night!
5
Visited the restaurant last Sunday and opted for the $88 set lunch. The food was nicely plated and tasted as good as its presentation. The staff were attentive and quick to respond to request. Overall, good dining experience and will be back again.
4
The restaurant serves excellent food. You can order set or a la carte. The service and ambience are good. As it is chinese fine dinning, price is on the high side.
4
Very good meal. The place could be warmer but the lobby of the hotel is nice. Its a bit costly but OK for Singapore standards. The staff was kind and professional.
4
Had a nice birthday celebration with family at the Majestic Restaurant. Food and ambience were good and the staff was knowledgeable when we asked questions about the food. The complementary longevity buns were a nice touch for a birthday celebration.
4
it's been a long while since we last visited this restaurant. Food is good as ever. We had a quiet weekend brunch in a group of 6. Will come back again for sure.
4
It would be very easy to have never seen this place because unless some-one would tell you about it, you would not necessarily know that it exists.the place is somewhat clinical in layout, but this should not and does not detract from a great variety of food on offer. We shared several dishes, not disappointed in any way
4
The staff were courteous and executed their role professionally. The ambience suiting the occasion, my wife's birthday. And the food? Chinese food done in a traditional way but given a updated presentation. Particularly like the individual platter of wasabi prawn, foie gras on watermelon and Peking duck skin on salad. The ribs had a marvelous lingering after taste. Wish I ordered the beef
4
Food was fresh, and serving wasn't done in a rush manner. Suitable for kids too! Presentation of the food was done appropriately. I requested for a birthday cake but they don't have it. They gave us mantou instead which I felt was a nice gesture, looking forward to visit Majestic again
4
My dad suggested this place for a family dinner on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is located in the New Majestic Hotel along Bukit Pasoh Road. Parking is abit of a problem as there are limited slots infront of the hotel so we parked nearby and walked over. The restaurant isn't exactly huge, but there were a considerable amount of people dining at that time. We ordered the set meal. The appetizer consisted of salted egg prawn, foie gras with watermelon and peking duck skin with some vegs. Was not too bad, just that it didn't arrive as warm as I'd have liked. You can have a choice in the soup - either sharks fin or assorted seafood treasures as they called it. I prefer the Ba Bao soup which came with a piece of truffle. I found the abalone with tofu a little too salty for my liking, but liked the mee sua soup with baby oysters. The broth was really flavourful, probably after stewing it with the oysters. And the finale... the Bubur Chacha! Was a nice surprise to see it wasn't actually the kind of dessert you will find outside (soup with yam and some tapioca bits). I will not be a spoiler, you have to find out for yourselves! Service wasn't that great though, service staff were not very attentive and looked glum
5
I was tired after a day in the heat of Singapore, so after checking TA, I found that one of the best restaurants in Singapore was in my hotel. What a gem! One entire wall of the place is taken up with plaques, vases, and awards for its excellent cuisine. The wait staff is most accommodating and my waiter took time to explain the unusual house” dishes and the freshness on the ingredients. I chose stir-fried bean curd with vegetables, an unusual veggie soup with spinach puree, and spicy scallops with broccoli. These were exquisitely prepared in the open kitchen and served piping hot. For dessert I had to try the venerable durian fruit; my verdict: no so good. I’d go here again; the service was wonderful and hotel guests receive a 15% discount. My bill was about $100 US
5
I was at Majestic Restaurant for dinner. Everything from the food to service to ambience was great. We chose the set dinner and enjoyed every dish.
5
Service was excellent! Complimentary birthday buns given to my 87 year old mum. So nicely presented. Thrilled the old lady so much! All other dishes had lovely presentations. Family had a great time!
5
Great service, and a really thoughtful menu. This low-key, yet trendy restaurant has some wonderful Singaporean fusion interpretations of classic Chinese dishes, well worth a visit.
Do not go past the chilli crab buns...
4
Great service and food was really good. For birthday celebrations, there is free longevity buns per diner.
4
The set dinner was delicious, elegantly presented, dessert choices were great, small but cozy environment, friendly service, highly recommended!!
5
Been many years since I went but the food quality is just as great! The lychee Siew Mai was yummy! Will be back!
4
My 2nd visit in 2016. WOrld gourmet summit dinner was good... The premium lunch menu is time to change as it was almost the same since last june. I had complimentary buns for my birthday for 11pax!
4
Had lunch here recently and was pleased to note that standards have been maintained. Ingredients were fresh and standard of cooking were good. Of course we would have loved to see more crab meat in the crab meat fried rice - we will remember to order additional crab meat in future. The roast pork or siew yoke was great and so was the Peking duck and the various appetisers we ordered. Desserts here were yummy too. We will continue to come here for a good feed
4
We ordered softshell crab for starters ( really generous portion for $20 ), followed by half a peking duck with meat served separately, two ways, drumstick and thigh meat nicely deboned and breast meat diced, fried with preserved veg and wrapped with lettuce, plus lobster noodles and pork ribs. Was going to order another starter but gentleman who took our order gently cautioned us against it as he felt we'd already overordered...and he was right! We didn't expect such generous portions, and wound up doggy bagging a bit of everything! With no alcohol, only tea, damage came to Sin$200 inclusive of service and GST which we felt was quite fair. The place wasn't too crowded, service was excellent. Would revisit
5
Was there last night and had a degustation menu. Very glad to secure one private dining room even though we booked last minute. You need a minimum order as well. Have been to this restaurant several times for dinner and the food is always excellent.But surpsinigly the very simple oyster mee sua took me by surprise. For the meat , you've a choice of beef or pork. Service was prompt. Food came quite fast and we had ample time to chat, not that they were trying to chase us away.There seems to be a citibank credit card promotion during this period. So don't leave home without it!
4
The previous week lunch was better. Ordered set lunch at $38. The soup is diluted. Overall standard is higher than most Chinese restaurants. I would go back to try other set meals. Pricing reasonable for the standard
4
Haven't been to Majestic for years.
Quality of food is still as good as before. Thumbs up!
Will be back soon.
2
Food is pricey for the small portion. The standard of the food has dropped. Nothing fantastic for the price. The restaurant was hot and stuffy as our table was near the kitchen. We had feedback to the staff but they were nonchalant about it. Not suitable for large group. Will not patronise again.
5
The food was super delicious. Had their trio platter, claypot farm chicken, small abalone mee sua, double boiled truffle soup, etc. I'm still savoring the flavour. However, I find that the main dinning area was a bit too dim for us to see the menu properly.
4
It has been three years since I came for a meal here. We had a private room and a set menu. The corkage for wine is $20 per bottle and the waitress is quite reasonable in handling champagne, white and several red wines. The set menu that we took actually also provided free flow white and red white for three hours, and the wines were average. The presentation of the food was good. Had a six course meal for $75+++/pax including the free flow wine.
5
Brought our sleeping toddler there to celebrate my wife's birthday together with her parents. The service and food were excellent and the staff took care of my sleeping toddler by clearing space for the stroller instead of leaving the baby chair there.Had Majestic Platter, Peking Duck (with ee-fu duck noodles and Homemade Tofu. Spent $133
4
- Duck meat was very tender- XO carrot cake was good!- Service staff was polite but not comparable to the price you pay to dine here- Restaurant was rather empty during lunch but there is still a minimal charge policy for private rooms..
4
we finally managed to get a table at the restaurant on the spur pf the moment the evening before we left. The restaurant had been busy, fully booked, at both lunch time an in the evening since we arrived due to the Chinese New Years celebrations.The meal was a good one although it is pricey.
5
The food was fantastic and did not disappoint us once again. The price is slightly steep but if you are looking at pampering yourself with Cantonese Cuisine with nice ambience. Majestic Restaurant is located near the Outram MRT for those who do not drive. It is just 10 minutes walk away
2
A very dissapointing meal. How this Resturant is rated so highly in do not understand ! It is the CAFE Resturant of the hotel. The pictures are out dated. We arrived at 8:30 PM by 9:30 they were laying up for breakfast ! It is just like a Buffett Resturant in a cheap hotel. The staff were not attentive, do not expect your food to come out at the same time. It does not. When we asked why this was we were told that is how the chinease like it ! We got the rice last. Very odd ! I would say don't bother with this place. Go to China town you will get a better meal , and a fraction of the price , from a market stall.
5
The dining experience never fail us each time we dine there. Besides the good food, the service is of equal par. Kudos to the team.
5
This was the third time and I must say although the price is on a high side, but the food quality is still there..worth to give a try
4
Excellent service from attentive staff.
Exquisite modern chinese cuisine.
Last but not least, the ambience is great.
5
It was so good that I went back for a second visit - it is also popular with well-heeled Chinese and you need to book
5
This is one of the best Peking Duck restaurants in Singapore!! The aircon is quite cold so bring a jacket and a hat if you have no hair!
5
Excellent food, we choose a 5 sampler course dinner n it is really value for monies. Will return for great chinese food. The double boiled soup is really wonderful with quality stuff n refined taste.
4
We had our breakfasts included in our stay at New Majestic, and they were very complete with Asian and Western amenities.
3
We came here on Friday evening,Had an amazing meal at this new establishment this evening. Really can't rate it highly enough. The ambience was cosy and inviting, the service attentive and professional and the food top-notch. I live close by so was excited about a new addition to the neighbourhood and was not at all disappointed
3
We ordered crab meat fish maw soup (too salty n lil crab meat), peking duck(it was the nicest dish), scallops with Asparagus (Asparagus too hard, scallop was ok thou), Abalone mee sua (the abalone is miniature size n the soup base is all sesame taste what soup base is this???
5
This is a gem that was suggested to us by friends who live in Singapore. The menu is extensive in particular with many seafood options. We started with the spring rolls and enjoyed boneless chicken with mango as well as prawns with "secret" sauce. Everything was very fresh and delicious. You can see through the open kitchen how much preparation and thought goes in to each dish. If we had another night in Singapore we would have definitely gone again.
4
Late here recently on a conference trip- we were taken here by a colleague who is a "local". Food and service excellent, some unusual combinations but we thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff very helpful in selecting dishes.
5
Great degustation menu, particularly recommend the Foie Gras and Caramelised banana appetizer. Entrees and dessert didn't quite hit the same heights but overall a very enjoyable meal, good wine selection, lovely ambiance and great service.
4
I have been here a few times and am impressed each time I am there. Beautifully churned out food with a modern twist.
Pricing is above average and portion slightly small but I will be back for sure.
4
Situated in Bukit Pasoh, Chinatown area. Delicious Cantonese Fusion. The degustation menu is a must try. Peking duck skin and foie gras is a delightful sin. I like to pare the meal with a pot of Chrysanthemum tea...
5
Exquisitely put together dishes that win on both presentation and taste. Taking a modern fusion spin on the usual Chinese delicacies, it provides a rather unique and enjoyable dining experience. Save some room for heir desserts which are just as good. Located in the lobby of the quaint New Majestic Hotel, its service standards are high so this is perfect for business meals and gatherings. Though note that most dishes are charged by per serving per person.Reservations are recommended due to the small set-up but there are lovely booth seats for a more intimate dining experience and small private rooms for larger groups. Tables are sometimes set up in the lobby when the restaurant is full but that was fine as dining amongst the collection of contemporary art pieces of the hotelier makes it very much an unique experience
5
I had an amazing lunch at the Majestic. Each dish was executed flawlessly and with a subtle novelty that I really enjoyed.I found the dining area very peaceful and sophisticated. Apparently that isn't always the case, but if you can beat the crowd it is a delight as well
4
Your opinion of the food depends on your personal preference, either you like it or not - hence, the title of this review.For example, 2 bowls of wasabi-flavoured potato chips were served. While I find it ok, others in my group didn't like them and preferred to have normal chips.The food were modern Chinese fusion style. The teriyaki sauce of the chicken and lamb chops was a tad too sweet while the beef steak (thinly sliced) was tasty. The shark-fin, chicken soup and fish (soon hock) were delicious. The appetizer, consisting of crab craw, foi gras and roast pork, was good too. However, to a few in the group, the foi gras was deemed a tad bitter or they just don't like to eat this item - so, it's personal preference. The abalone was cooked perfectly but the mee sua that was served with a sauce was more of a miss instead of a hit. The dry version would be better.The avacado ice cream and sorbet with aloe vera and grass jelly left much to be desired. The liew sa bao (salted egg custard) filling has a "weird" taste - it was not what you expect a salted egg custard to taste like. The service was excellent and the setting was fine
3
The restaurant was full of people at 8 o'clock and very noisy. It was almost impossible to hear what people said on the other side of the table. We ordered a five course menu "chef yong's signature". The starter chilled sake infused crabmeat salad was extremely good but other courses were flavorless although the price was 188S$/ person. Wines were excellent but expensive. The service was impeccable.
4
Five we were stating here and were tied to step out we decided on dinner at the restaurant and we were so impressed with the did. We started off with roast pork served as is with a sliver of mustard and chilli sauce on the side. Fantastic quality and great taste. Then we had the crispy baby squid in honey sauce, this is seriously crispy and a but on the sticky sweet side. Then came the wasabi prawns, which were completely fab. Each jumbo prawn was fried lightly tempura style, coated in a wasabi based paste placed on a round watermelon piece. The flavours meshed beautifully and it wasn't at all spicy and even my 5 year old daughter enjoyed it. Then came a beautiful pork fat juicy rib with the right amount of fat to lean meat ratio. We also had a stunning veggie dish with mushrooms hazelnuts and greens and an amazingly flavourful noodles dish as well. Till now our best meal of the trip. A must visit to this quirky fun hotel and we discovered a true gem within a gem
3
Menu here is quite interesting i.e. fusion Chinese food. More importantly, it is tasty and nice; but don't expect top notch dining here. Its just a simple, cozy restaurant for good food at very reasonable pricing. My favourite here is their wasabi prawns. Would recommend this place for people who are just looking for good food
4
We were staying in the hotel & ate here on our first night as were late arrivals. The food didnt disappoint at all, beer was overpriced though. Try the spring rolls - delicious !
5
Restaurant has a good menu. The best Cantonese Cuisine. Food and service are just excellent, staff are very corteous.
4
We were directed to the Majestic by the St. Regis Hotel staff because the Majestic was able to guarantee gluten free cooking. We enjoyed a gin and tonic for a reasonable $10SD on a very hot and muggy day. We had roasted chicken with rice, which was very good. Service was very good, quite friendly, and we would highly recommend trying this place. The restaurant is a little hard to find. Just ask those in the know for the Majestic Hotel
5
I love Majestic Restaurant for it's food, and space. Located inside the quirky Majestic Hotel, the restaurant is cosy and classy, the dim sum and dinner and both excellent, and the service is excellent. Would recommend if you are craving well made Chinese food. We had the set menu, and everything was plated beautifully as well
5
Aside from Majestic Restaurant located their are also two more other Restaurant to Dine in but I prepared for a Buffet that offers Majestic restaurant. Th choices are tremendously fantastic for the eyes and taste, for the Price 599Pesos/per head, it's more than what you get. Try it 
5
Definitely a restaurant that I would recommend to both locals and foreigners who enjoy good Cantonese cuisine in a boutique style setting. It is good for a table for two as well as family dinners. Although most of the patrons that evening were locals, they serve dishes which I believe foreigners would enjoy. The Beijing duck was indeed a pleasant surprise to me. The crispy duck skin is probably the one of the better ones I have tasted. While it does not taste the same as the ducks derived in restaurants like DaTong in Beijing, the quality remains good. Those crispy skins in Beijing when well made will melt in your mouth, the crispy feeling from majestic will linger in your mouth as you sink your teeth into it. I would suggest that instead of wrapping with the skin, try the first few pieces of the skin on the back of duck near to the neck area without any sauce or wrapping and you will understand what I mean. The hot and sour soup is very spicy. It lacks the flavor of the Sichuan peppercorn but has a more direct peppery tasteMost of the service staff speak better English than Chinese which was a surprise to me since all of the customers were Chinese that day. The restaurant manager is indeed very helpful which makes the whole experience one notch better. The place is quite cramped but it still provides a pleasant environment for a big family dinner.
4
The striking feature of this restaurant is its stylish yet vintage ambience, with interesting details in its furnishings which makes it a nice dining establishment to entertain friends or colleagues. The service was good, polite and attentive.We had the degustation menu which on the whole was a good price given the quality of food that you get. This is a fusion restaurant with a modern interpretation of Cantonese food - so those who are more traditional may not necessarily find this to be great. The mix of flavours is targeted towards those who are more adventurous, more modern and if you belong to this group then yes, this is a great restaurant which delivers. If you wish to taste traditional Cantonese, then the food here has a different slant which perhaps you may find odd. All items on the degustation menu were well presented, and of high quality - special mention goes to the Boston Lobster noodles and the crispy durian ice cream (this is a must try for durian lovers!). The pan seared fillet of rib eye was a tad over done and a little ordinary but on the whole, all dishes were delightful. Portions were more than sufficient and we ended the meal very satisfied. An interesting menu and great ambience - a nice combination for a night out
4
I love this place for its Degustation Cantonese Menu for two that I could hardly find in other Chinese restaurants. Usually we have a problem ordering food for 2 in Chinese resturant, as most of the dishes are meant for 4 to 6 persons. Majestic's set dinner degustation menu feature 5 well prepared dishes with your choice of more than a dozen tempting desserts. Price range from $68++ to $188++ per head. We usually go for the $88 meal which is very satisfying and special. The ambience is intimate and cosy, service is attentive and friendly, food is served at the right temperature with quality ingredients, and the taste pairing between courses is well thought of. Highly recommended for Elegant/Creatiave Chinese Food fans
5
I came down for my birthday dinner with my family as we were looking for a different restuarant for dinner rather than the usual places. The ambiance was good but the location a bit out of way. The Peking duck was superb, cut thinly without any fat and then served two ways with fried e fu noodles. The soup made with giant Garoupa head was especially nice. Very sweet and filling. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice Chinese restuarant
5
Food presentation was excellent.Had the set meal, started with lychee and siew Mai with slice of Peking duck.Sharks fin soup was tasty.Beef was so-so though portion was good.Lobster noodle was delish with juicy lobster meat.Ended meal with also Vera and grass jelly sorbet.A refreshing desser
4
Dinner is good, but watch the prices! Look for the 3 glass circles on the ceiling, you may spot someone swimming in the pool above the restaurant. :)
4
The food served was fantastic...
Like the selection of food in the set menu...
Yummy wasabi prawns, peking duck, lobster noodle...
Dessert was refreshing too..fried durian ice cream, pulot hitam served with ice cream.
A must try place if you are in spore.
4
The restaurant is quite small but cozy and nice. Food is really good and can tell that the ingredients used is very fresh and premium.
Service is decent, all in all will definitely come back and this place is recommended!
3
Came for the last night of the WGS with a full house. Service felt stretched although still very professional but the dining room was too noisy. Food quality was ok despite excellent presentation. I had expected better as it was a guest chef. Will go back and try their normal menus again
4
Tried this for World Gourmet Summit 2014 in a collaboration with Eu Yan Sang, using premium herbs infused in Chinese dishes.I highly recommend trying this stop for WGS 2014, due to the uniqueness and medicinal properties of the dinner, rather than the usual self-indulgent, fine-dining fare seen so often.Masterchef Arron Huang and Hosting Chef Yong Bing Ngen combine medicinal herbs into culinary masterpieces for patrons at Majestic restaurant
2
I never felt so ripped off before and coming from Hong Kong that says a lot. The bill for the dinner that we had for 2 people came out to S175. Paying for half of that amount would be too much. We don't mind paying for something that is worth it. This is definitely not the place and definitely not a place I would recommend
5
Despite the updated presentation of the dishes, I was glad the pure unadulterated flavour of good Cantonese cooking was preserved. We were a party of two and my guest could only take plain and non greasy food. We started with the appetiser trio: my guest had Peking duck, wasabi prawn and scallop while I had Peking duck, scallop and crab claw. Both of us enjoyed our appetisers which were exquisite and definitely yummy. Next, we had the soup of the day which was refreshing - although it looked a little cloudy, the taste was clean and flavoursome. The fried rice with egg white, dried scallop, and fresh crabmeat together with Chinese Box Thorn (aka Matrimony Vine or 'kau kei') in superior stock came next. Both were excellent. We ended our meal with an updated buboh cha cha for my guest and aloe vera jelly with mango sorbet for me. This was not a set meal but a la carte - we had some idea of what we liked and the restaurant manager helped us finalise our order quite speedily. All in, a great spread that was flavoursome without excessive oil, and salt. We were able to savour the freshness of the ingredients and the awesome cooking skills of the chef. The long running Citibank visa card promotion helped defray the 15% service charge. A great lunch
5
A very memorable dining experience. We went on a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was not crowded. Food quality was, however, excellent. The prawns were really good, and the vegetables were of very high quality. Service was also excellent (minus one junior staff who was clearly still learning the ropes). Five of us dined (no alcohol) and the check came out to be S$370. It is not the cheapest but for the quality, I would most definitely go back there again. Definitely worth going !

When my husband have guests in town, this restaurant is his top choice as food has always been consistently good and service attentive. Helmed by award winning Chef Yong Bing Ngen, the cuisine is cantonese served in western style. I went there recently with some friends and we ordered the deluxe set lunch at $60 per person served with free flow of chilled herbal tea. I am not a siew mai fan but I like this version with lychee. The sliced peking duck was nice but unremarkable while the beancurd skin with foie gras disappointing, being dry and overfried. The double soup is good while the grilled chicken chop was perfectly grilled with meat tender and had a pleasant smoky flavour. My favourite item on the set is the stewed boston lobster noodles - so good I could have eaten another portion of this. Dessert can be chosen from the desert menu - my group almost unanimously chose the durian paste with gula melaka which was worth every calorie

Simply to die for. You have to like duck. You have to like seafood. You have to like a mixture of all of it. It just keeps on coming in bitesize portions. Heavily recommended.

This is a small but elegant restaurant where you can choose from a range of set menus.My only gripe was that every menu contained a soup which included shark-fin. You can ask to not include this but they do nothing to replace the flavour lost.For larger groups they have a small private banqueting room

Was there recently for dinner and had one of the degustation set dinners. The starter of crispy warabi prawn, peking duck and pan seared foie gras was really nicely done. The pan seared ribeye was also extremely tender and tasty. Would definitely go back there to try out other dishes

I visited this restaurant twice and enjoyed myself each time. The presentation of the food was good. I like the starter with foie gras, Peking duck and prawn. The staff are experienced and attentive; we felt pampered. In terms of ambience, it he restaurant is nice and cosy. It is pretty quiet and thus a good place for hosting guests or catching up with friends.Overall, this is an excellent restaurant

Have ate in Majestic a number of times and have not been disappointed. The tasting menu is fabulous, particular highlights are the wasabi prawns and the steak in the soup dish. Delicious. Only complaint was that the staff were a little too attentive at times and hadn't finished chewing my last bite before the dish was taken away.

Situated at an unassuming part of the town, who could ever think that this restaurant in a small hotel served one of the best Chinese fusion cook ever! I was totally blown away.The dinner started off with a triple bang! The foie gras was perfectly seared, the peking duck skin was excellent that I could not stop eating it and the wasabi prawn was well balancedThe soup was so flavourful. Not the best lamb rack that I had (it was still good) but the Chinese carrot cake was out of the world.Throughout the meal, there wasn’t a single dish that had let me down. And it all ended off so well with that to-die-for crispy durian ice-cream

Have been here a few times in the past 10 years and they don't disappoint , their ranking should be higher and got pulled down by some eccentric diners and reviewers here. Came here for lunch today and was happy they had a dim sum selection. The BBQ pork puff is better than most, and the crabmeat bun delivers like the good ol' Singapore chilli crabs. The garlic tofu was deliciously soft with generous portions of healthy garlic. And the noodles mee sua with scallops was delicious , though a tad too salty . Overall another good experience and always a sound choice if you're in the area or your favorite restaurant is ful

The Majestic is centrally located near Chinatown. There are private rooms for a quieter atmosphere as the larger centre room can be noisy. There are set menus and these range in price from $50 per person up to $1888 for ten people. You can also have a dim sum menu on weekend and public holidays.The flavors here are designed to give a new feel to some Chinese classics. The tofu tastes fresh and the noodles are delicious.The service is good .. Some delays if it is a busy lunchtime..... So be prepared to have a nibble on the wasabi chips and find a good drink .or browse some interesting objects in the foyer.

We had our mother's birthday dinner celebration on 6 Oct 2012 and our family was happy with the entire staff of Majestic Restaurant for their excellent food and great services. A complimentary peach longevity buns ("寿桃") as the opening simple but extremely meaningful dish for us. It has warm Soft custard creme oozing slowly out when you bite on these buns, the taste was exquisite and refine. Even the last dish, Chef Yong team manage to put the fruits platter nicely to us. Thank you for your great service and good food

am surprised by some of the bad reviews on this restaurant. have been there a few times over the past few years and I never fail to be impressed each and every single time; be it the quality of the food or service. the quality of the food has been extremely consistent; and that's consistently good, over the years. and it's always a joy to watch Chef Yong work in his kitchen every, single, time. definitely has gotta be one of the best, if not the best, modern chinese restaurant in singapore or even asia

shark fin soup! it was really awesome even though i have tasted many restaurants in singapore (more than 100 now)

Breakfast was good. Eggs to order etc. Dinner was very good but perhaps a bit expensive.

Some if the best Chinese food I have tasted but totally ruined by the worst service I have ever encountered.

My sisters and friends were here in Feb. We had two starters - scallops wrapped in bacon and a fish. the other one was a wasabi prawn with foei gras and peking duck. We enjoyed both starters although the peking duck could do with some fats and meat. However both were good.The salted egg prawn was good. Next we had ribs and this mushroom with broccoli. These two were not the best. Our favourite must be the noodles. The wagyu beef cheek noodle was very good. The beef was tender and melt in your mouth. The other noodle we had was the noodle with scallops. It was really good and the soup was perfect.. although i would have loved a bigger portion :)All in all, the food is really good here and we would definitely come back. We were there on Friday night and had to wait a while for the food but it was definitely worth the wait :

The wasabi prawns was as good as we last remembered it to be.The kailan with mushrooms though, lacked the wok hei.The century egg tofu was a hit and miss. The tofu was really fine but the sauce was so-so,,,,The goose fillet though, remained as good as it gets. Crispy skin, little fat and firm flesh and the Teochew style vingear dip was good.The bamboo clams was enjoyable.But the trio combination platter (in individual servings) was good and highly recommended.The marble goby, done Cantonese oil-fried style, was truly crispy, tasty and savoury. The claypot rice with preserved meat was a nice surprise. Initially we were disapointed as we did not have any of the charred bits that is the key attraction of claypot rice but on closer inspection of the claypot, we realised the mainland chinese attendant (through her own good naturedness) thought serving us the charred bits was rude and so did not scrape nor serve it to us but once done, it was a good claypot in singapore.The fried mao sang wang durian ice-cream was as good as it gets, so full of aroma and body,,,Overall, we enjoyed the experience esp as the hotel is nice and always good to go back. Recommend the private room as you get to see whats happening in the open kitchen behind

We had set dinner for five and "pen cai" on the last day of CNY. Nothing was good except the fried rice. The pecking duck had no taste and was sliced into thick pieces. Shark fin soup had huge amount of starch in it and tasted odd. Fish was average and king prawns tasted bitter. This is not only my personal opinion but of a group of five. Can't believe this restaurant had won that many awards. I would not return to here again. I would rather go to crystal jade for more authentic and value for money Chinese food

Overall the restaurant looks overly modern and a bit cold, and so is the temperature: dress accordingly! The wine was super, and the food - shrimps - excellent. The apogee however was the Fried Durian desert. I have an Indonesian legacy in my family history, and lived on Java till I was 8. My father forbade durian in our house, so my mother took us to an old aunt to eat it. Majestic serves it sort of 'Baked Alaska-style' so it does not smell. But oh boy: the taste was there: heaven

Had dinner here with a group of 9 people in a smart modern private room. The food arrived mostly cold and the service was not up to par. Location was great and easy access to China town. The Colonial facade and chic atmosphere were a plus.

The food was hit and miss but the service was just awful. The food took a long time to arrive and they repeatedly messed up our order. I specifically told the person taking the order that a certain food item would make me sick, and an alternative was offered. But that dish was prepared with the item and I did get sick. The service staff made no attempt to apologize to me after that was pointed out while we were still in the restaurant. The staff only called me on my mobile after I left to "check on me" -- and that's after we told the front desk we were going to complain to the owners of the restaurant. I doubt I'd ever go back and will certainly tell my friends about my experience

The food is really excellent, but the service could be better. We loved the crispy oysters and the prawns with wasabi dressing! Maybe it is our European habit to serve all the dishes at the same time, but I really didn't like that we first got my main course, when I was finished my partner got his and after that, we got our rice. Please serve it at the same time!But overall: very good food! A must go

This fancy restaurant boasts a good fusion of western and eastern cuisine in its menu. The food is delectable without being overly-pricey.
