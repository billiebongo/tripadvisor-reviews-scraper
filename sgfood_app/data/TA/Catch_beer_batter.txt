Food was nice but not especially cheap, likewise the drinks. Good location in Clarke Quay. Service good

Great little spot by the river in Clark Quay. Despite the tourist location, it was awesome. The halibut fish and chips were nearly perfect. And surprise: one of the best margaritas Iâ€™ve had. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!

Wonderful fish soup lunch! It was a bowl of sunshine while a storm was raging outside! Not too much chilli and plenty of fish/shellfish in a tomato base. Washed down with an Orvieto, life doesn't get much better.

We found this a very pleasing menu, with good choices and decent prices. Very nice place to have a Romy draft beer, and good service too. Enjoy!

Trying to find a place to eat with an awkward 12 year old daughter was driving me and the wife crazy when we happened across this bar. It sold fish and chips which the daughter wanted (donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask) and also gave us a few more adult options in regards to food. Both starters/appetisers were stunning (prawns/squid) and our mains of ribs and a seafood pasta were again of high quality. The bar also do an offer in regards to beer if you order food (much needed after dealing with the 12 ye old) and staff were lovely and very attentive. I would recommend

Had dinner at Catch with a group of friends. It was a good thing their menu had many choices ranging from starters, mains and pastas as we could try a little of everything. Check out their seafood aglio olio and BBQ pork ribs. Calamari and Fish and Chips are certainly worth trying!Definitely a great place for group gatherings, in-house games or just to chill

Visited here on last night of holiday. Disappointing service with only one meal arriving at table. My husband's only arriving just before I had finished mine and that only being achieved after threatening to leave. There were no apologies and on being led to till adjacent to kitchen to enter credit card pin number, it was noticeable that the kitchen was little bigger than a cupboard. This may account for problematic service when the restaurant was less than busy. Wouldn't return

The restaurant was empty when we arrived, compared to all the other restaurants which were full, so we should have thought twice. The food is over priced and the fish and chips were super greasy... Actually felt quite sick after our meal. I would not recommend this place really.

I visited catch beer and batter on the last day of a holiday. I wish I had found it before as I would have made more than 1 visit. The fish was delicious and the batter very tasty. Good chips with a little salad on the side.Very good value for a lunch special as an iced tea was included in the price.Singapore tends to be pricey to eat out so this was a welcome find
