Chat Siew, roast meat, duck or chicken rice. Dumplings, wonton. I have tried all.Used to be very good but I feel it has loose the steam nowadays. Usually can find seats during lunch time. 2nd level is air conditioned. CoffeeIs nice. Their fish soup also average but always have queue too.Can try if you are around this area. Never tried their western food before.

Each time we go to Singapore, this would be one of the places we must come and eat, and usually it would be more then then just one time dining each time we go to Singapore. The pork roast is juicy yet crispy, the charsiu succulent, Last but not least, their chili sauce is hot yet tangy giving it a fresh taste that works well with the pork roast, making it taste not too rich. What more is there to say? yes, they have other menus...but I am hooked with just these. Ahh and the price? very very good!!! not expensive at all. a must try for those who loves chinese style pork roast
