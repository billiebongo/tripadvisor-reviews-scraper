great choice of food with reasonable price. They also have lunch package suited to your budget. Restaurant exhaust system has to improve.

You wont miss your pinoy home cooked meals when you drop by this resto. Not to mention the great ambiance full of pinoy memorabilias. Definitely will be back for the delish cheap eats and the various range of the daily menu.

A great meal is what I always missed about the Philippines. We just ended our 4 day lunch marathon at Turo-Turo and what can I say. I just the best "food outlet" in Singapore that serves just about any filipino food. I will never forget the salted egg that they have on their Tapsilog that comes with a soup and complimentary drink. We had a transition training and we always look forward to their menus. A must try is their crispy pata & tortang talong. Did I also mention I had an extra rice when I ordered the grilled chicken? It was just the best in Singapore. Aside from the friendly service crew, they play the music of 80's and 90's which brings back memories. Surely, you will feel at home here. To cap the marathon, we had san mig light here. Simply worth your money and effort especially if you queue on lunch time
