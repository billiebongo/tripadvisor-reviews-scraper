Great food and great ambience. Food variety is good. Dessert spread is great too. Overall, a great restaurant!!!
4
Food was not bad but the range was quite limited. Staff are friendly, warm and helpful. Hope selection of food will be more in future.
4
Kintamani serves an indo buffet. I like the food, esp their lamb leg, chilli crab and sweet sauce chicken. Service also friendly and prompt.
4
Good ambience and service. Worth coming again. XMas dinner in a cosy setting. There was even turkey on the menu!
4
Food is nice with reasonable varieties and the durian dessert is good... Beef tendon is highly recommended... The place is a bit small and someone is having function there when I was there...

My family normally avoid hot / spicy (chili) food. For a change, we reserved a table (for 5) and celebrated my daughter's 30th Birthday at Kintamani Indonesian Restaurant. Only $30 net / pax with Platinum Passion Card. Promotion until end March '18. Kintamani is Halal Restaurant - no pork. My family enjoyed the sumptuous spread of cooked food, desserts/ fruits: Delicious Satays (beef, chicken) - best, excellent Fried Prawn Dumpling (2nd best), oxtail soup (excellent) , beef rendang (love it but too spicy for my younger son/daughter) , nice grilled lamp leg (served) , fried fish (just nice/not oily), big prawns (hot & cold), curry chicken, curry vegetables, DIY laksa, gadogado etc. Cakes, nonya kuehs, durian pengat (excellent - it is durian season now), goreng pisang (hot & crispy), rice paste with gula melaka (my wife's favourite), bubur hitam, cendol (my family's favourite), nangka (love it), jumbo, guava, longan , buah salak , ice creams (4 flavours - love the mangka, durian ). Drinks: Lime juice (nice), DIY tea, coffee from coffee maker. Satays, Fried Dumplings and Durian Pengat finished fast ! Food were replenished regularly. Enjoyed the good food / cosy / friendly atmosphere . Plates were cleared often / fast. Mr. Zakaria greeted and attended to us on arrival and departure. Also given a complementary parking ticket ! We had an enjoyable lunch. Compliments / thanks to the very pleasant, capable and helpful Mr. Zakaria (manager) , Chef, Ms. Wendy and staff for the great food and excellent services

We went for dinner buffet with the 1 for 1 promo. Dinner varieties is okay. I like the durian pengat. Some of the selection are tasty. The seating arrangements can be better. It feels like the restaurant trying to squeeze many people in it as walking space is limited.
3
They place was quiet and cosy. It was also near and clean. Coming to the food, didn't justify the price tag of $60 for the buffet dinner. Food spread was limited, not a varied selection to choose from. They could improve on this if they want to fill up their seating capacity.
4
Upon entering Kintamani Indonesian Restaurant, staff in Javanese style attire welcome us to our reserved tables. The ambience is pleasant with Javanese style decorations. Restaurant is not big, it was quite cramped for us to move around for the buffet spread as besides us another group is having a function. The Staff are attentive and accommodative with genuine smile. On the Buffet spread display, it has large selection of food choices with various kind of fruits and types of dessert. We had a great time here for lunch and it is certainly worth the visit !!
2
Only 1 fish dish (dory) that was in batter. Soup, tendon and roast lamb was good. Otherwise the dishes were very average an non exciting. The much anticipated rending was tough. Desserts were on the dry side for the nonya cakes. I would consider this to be an expensive buffet for the standard of cooking
5
The food very well prepared large selection many international chefs
Bali Chef Naomi very good good selection carvers curries seafood fresh prawns
5
The must try food when you are at Kintamani is the Rendang! Always never fail us when we are there. Overall it's an excellent Indonesian food.
4
The cuisine was purely Indonesian with a lot of variety of food to choose from the buffet and the deserts were delicious.
5
Will definitely be back there again! Worth the money. Food was good and service was good too! Although the gado gado sauce should be improved.
4
The place is a bit cramped in my opinion, they also took awhile to clear our plates. Otherwise this restaurant is overall okay, food was okay.
3
The curry with rice...... heaven ! A few types for you to choose. Curries are very well cook.
Other food was average.
4
My wife and I recently dined at the restaurant in celebration of our 15th wedding anniversary as well as my wife's birthday. We'd like to take this opportunity to extend our gracious thanks to your staff who took the trouble to set our dining table nicely in view of our double celebration. The little gift tokens they had prepared was a lovely touch. Your staff, Roozland Sudanto was excellent at welcoming us and ensuring that we are well taken care of. And the food was authentic in taste. In fact your entire team there made us feel so welcomed and the complimentary birthday cake they managed to arrange was the perfect final touch!We'd definitely look forward to returning to your restaurant in the future with our family and friends.Keep up the good work
5
My hubby n I had the Indonesian food buffet which we are amazed by the high quality n freshness of the food. We are also intrigued by the wide spread of the buffet & almost every dish is delicious. The ambience of the restaurant is also very cosy n with the soft Indonesian music makes us very relaxed to enjoy the food. I would definitely recommend Kintamani Indonesian Restaurant to others

This restaurant serves mainly Indonesian fares, as the restaurant name implies. The Restaurant has small seating capacity and the tables are too close for comfort. The choice of food is also limited and quality average. The price is mid range. The restaurant also has constant promotions tying up with various credit cards. However, in view of the type, quality and range of food offered, it is an average fare; this is reflected by the crowd of dinners visiting the restaurant.
3
Dine there with friends. You can feel the indonesian ambience and the food are nice. Price talk, no complaints. I get what I paid for within my expectations. My only observation is that, not much varieties of food. The people working their are attentive, the place is abit squeezy though. I wish they have brighten up abit the lighting inside the resto. I give 3 star for the over all experience. I am not looking forward, but I dnt mind coming back.
4
Staff is professional but not friendly :( food is okay. I bought the cash voucher so it's 30nett which is reasonable.
3
Was told by a staff at 2.10pm that the lunch buffet would be closing soon. Before I could get more food, another staff started keeping the food items and serving tongs at 2.15pm. When I enquired about the closing time, I was told it is 2.30pm. When I was asked to settle the bill at 2.15pm, the female staff was visually annoyed that I wanted to pay via my pre-paid Chope vouchers. Her tone was rude when she questioned if I had printed out the voucher. When I told her that I had not (as I usually just show the voucher number on my mobile phone), she told me to email Kintamani the vousher. No please nor thank you. Just gave me a namecard with the email address and told me to do so. Very disappointed by this. It will be my first and last time dining here
4
Went for Friday night 6pm reservation. We were the first to arrive and waited outside till a group of two diners entered before we decided to go in. The crowd only starts to come in at 7pm.The food was good. Decent spread and the chef constantly topped up the food. No need to worry if you arrive slightly later from their opening time. The ambience was on the dark side but I can still see my food. Good for a date I suppose? I just have a personal preference for dining in brightly lit areas.Service was excellent. Friendly staff who keep on refilling your water and cleared your plates. My only gripe was that the staff who was manning the cashier counter was annoyed when I showed her my chope voucher in email. They seemed to prefer printed out coupons. She asked me to send my voucher to their kintamani email address for them to process it. After I left, I was called shortly to go back to sign the receipt. The same staff was much more friendlier and nicer. LOL.Location wise is quite difficult to get to. If you travel by car, good for you. If you travel via public transport, that just sucks.I bought the coupons during the Chope WOW sale in April 2017? So my cost per person was quite good. For that sale price, I consider this meal to be really fantastic as I had tried other hotel halal buffets for a similar price and the food was horrible with a poor spread
4
Food was awesome but selections are quite limited, atmosphere was very authentic indonesian and I absolutely loved their fish crackers, so crispy. I visited the outlet with my mum using the chope vouchers which saved us quite a lot of money, but would not visit the outlet if without any promotions
3
The restaurant is serving indonesian malay food. You will not get your usual sashimi or fresh seafood (except for prawns on ice) there. Food is generally tasty, esp the grilled chicken with sweet sauce n chilli crabs. Unfortunately, they are serving the chicken kebab instead of roasted lamb leg which is much better. The beef rendang is also not as good as before as it is slightly tough. Kambing soup is tasty though. There is also a nice selection of fruits, including rambutans as well as jackfruits n mangosteen. Given the 1 for 1 promo, the buffet is certainly fair value for money
4
I appreciate the restaurant's assistance in celebrating my friend's birthday. Communication between the maitre'd and hostess could have been better. Thankfully, when we asked for the cake that one of my friends purchased, it was retrieved without question. The quality of the food served remains up to mark, even when I dined there on 25 May 201, as with every visit. Thanks again for the delightful experience every time
4
We were there for my brother's birthday dinner as he had a 1-for-1 buffet voucher from a local telco.First impressions - seems like a tight squeeze for a buffet setup but the spread was good. Ranging from cold seafood to authentic Indonesian dishes. However, some did not hit the mark for us - like the Mee Rebus, sauce was thick enough but sourish, and the kueh kuehs - which were nice to look at but didnt live up to the taste.Some of the staff were super friendly, like the chef, who greeted us at the door and even showed us around the buffet! At least he takes pride in his work
5
We had 30 people for the buffet dinner at Kintamani, which is a fabulous restaurant and perfect for our mixed group of halal and non-halal eaters! The quality and breadth of the buffet selection was impressive. Beautiful fresh satays, oxtail soup, and beef rendang were highlights. We went with a bunch of kids and even the pickiest eater was satisfied (though the dessert buffet may have contributed to that)! The staff were lovely and helpful. It is in a good location in River Valley and I would recommend if for families
5
Have heard so much abt Kintamani & finally got to try it when my husband's company presented us with a dinner for 2 gift voucher here in celebration of our 10th anni. The gentleman at the entrance welcomed us warmly & even congratulated us! We were surprised that they even had a small gift prepared for us waiting at our table. As for the food, the buffet spread was amazing! The dishes really taste authentically Indonesian... We love how they had all the different sambals to choose from. Oh, and they even served crabs which were so fresh & succulent. Their desserts were so good too! Our only regret is not being able to stuff more in our tummy! Before we left, they had another surprise for us - a box of chocolates & complimentary parking! Really wasn't expecting the whole works but we truly appreciate it! Will definitely be coming back
4
Went over for its Lunch Buffet with family on a wkday. It's Ambience is very Indonesian style like.My Mother loved its satay texture and sauce, much loved by us the pengat durian part too. There's a HOT DRINK machine for the guests to help themselves, however there isn't for any COLD DRINK section. A bit disappointed on this... Having 1 wld be awesome really...The waiter n waitresses on duty was very prompt in clearing the empty plates and refilling drinks. Good job guys..
4
We stayed at Furama, so the discount for the buffet made it very worthwhile. We tried just about everything. Nothing blazingly unique, but overall decent quality.
4
This is one of the oldest eating establishment that is able to withstand challenges through its good food n pricing.... Manager Mr Zakaria is definitely one of its driving forces.... keep up the good work... and its Halal....
5
Huge spread of halal Indonesian food with reasonable price. Located in Furama Riverfront Hotel, this place is easy to locate. Yummy....
3
We had the buffet lunch. Great variety. The dessert spread is also very generous including longan fruits and ice cream. The yellow rice is full of fragrant. Also offer chilled cook prawn on ice and lamb on the wagon.At $55++ per adult. With some credit cards, can enjoy 50% off. Really value for money
4
Hosted a friend from Australia for dinner and requested for a local halal restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, you could feel yourself in baliness mood. The set up in the restaurant reminds me of the Kintamani in Bali. A small restaurant and it's good for people who want privacy.Some of must try dishes;Gado Gado Jakarta (a traditional mix of vegetables and peanut sauce)Mee Soto Ayam (egg noodles in clear chicken broth topped with shredded chicken)Tahu Telur Surabaya (deep-fried beancurd and egg tossed with grated vegetables and spicy sauce
5
My family normally frequented The Square (2nd Level), Miramar, Carousel, Holiday Inn Orchard, Jen, Tung Lok etc. For a change ; my wife and I celebrated our 36th Wedding Anniversary at Kintamani Indonesian Restaurant, yesterday. We loved the sumptuous spread of cooked food, desserts/ fruits: Delicious satays (beef, chicken), beef soup, beef rendang, roast beef (served) , fried fish (just nice/not oily), big prawns (hot & cold), curry chicken, curry vegetables, DIY mee siam, gadogado etc. Cakes, nonya kuehs, durian pengat, goreng pisang (hot & crispy), rice paste with gula melaka, bubur hitam, mangka, jumbo, guava, longan , ice creams , coffee etc. Enjoyed the good food / cosy atmosphere . Mr. Zakaria greeted and attended to us on arrival and departure. Nice complimentary winter melon tea from him too ! We had a very memorable/enjoyable wedding anniversary. Compliments/thanks to the very pleasant and helpful Mr. Zakaria (manager) and staff for the great food and excellent services
4
Did a reservation through Mr Roozland Sudanto, the Asst Restaurant Manager, Kintamani Restaurant for my family lunch. A very polite and assuring person.Was waiting for me when I came for the lunch and even allocated me a very private table at the corner with a very beautiful table set up. At some time during my lunch, Mr Roozland would come to my table and tell me about the food, He is indeed very professional in the job and polite, My wife not only enjoyed the lunch but also the restaurant set up and peaceful ambiance. Beside Mr Roozland, the staff was also friendly and the service is good. My wife and me enjoyed the tasty food there especially the ox tail soup at Kintamini restaurant and is considering having my 60th birthday celebration @kintamini next year.My compliments again to Mr Roozland and the staff. Thank yo
3
Had my team dinner at the restaurant. Generally the ambience is not too bad. Wait staffs are efficient in setting up the tables as we were early. Food spread - I am not a fan of Indonesian food, but I feel that the variety can be increased. Taste wise, it is ok
3
A good place for a halal gathering and if you're on a budget. The food was just average and variety was not too bad. Their desserts wasn't so good. It did not unleash the indonesian essence and tasted like a machine made knock off stuff. Other main dishes were fine.
4
Having Indonesian friend ends in town and taking them to the Kintamani is always a safe bet. The buffet offers variety and the comfort food they crave after a few days in Singapore. Safe bet always for business and family dining. Suggest reservations to be on the safe side
4
Nice food! Awesome service! Will definitely come here to celebrate birthday celebration again! Thumbs up!
4
Decently priced indonesian buffet spread. Good variety. Meat dishes were well cooked. Seafood was fresh and good selection of desserts too. Not much variety for vegetarians though and sop buntut was a lil disappointing. Overall good experience, good value and good deal.
4
We brought our mum to the restaurant on her birthday and she enjoyed the food and the ambience. It was a pleasant experience.
4
Good food and nice ambience. Good place to have celebration with family. A good choice location for halal buffet.
5
We had breakfast and lunch at this restaurant and the selection and food was superb could not have wanted more.
4
It has a nice ambience
Food wise its buffet spread is plentiful However, need more dishes that could be found in Indonesia (cabek hijau / merah / botol sosro etc)
4
I'm not well-versed with Indonesian food but I appreciated the wide buffet selection at Kintamani at Furama Riverfront. As I have food allergies, I'm glad that I still had a lot to choose from. Loved the spicy food!
5
This is among the best Indonesian buffet in Singapore! Leave some room for dessert! There are many traditional street snack
4
It would be better if they offer more variety like seafood...etc
Overall dinner was good. Nice ambience. Service also ok
4
Kintamani is an excellent Indonesian Restaurant, the food is good, with lot of options. had a great Lunch there
3
Just an average meal experience. The quality of the food is not too bad, but some are just average. We had the buffet but if there is no 1-for-1 promotion, the price ($55++ per pax) is actually very expensive.
5
great restaurant if your looking for indonesian food. Also good if you get their 1 for 1 promotion, so worth it! Have been here a few times and would not hesitate going back again!
4
very good atmosphere, good waitress and manager Zak has a very good personality, wide buffet spread, from the starters to dessert, satay, fried bananas fritters, main dishes, soups, noodles, coffee machine, ice cream, salad, there is something for everybody......
4
Good selection of Indonesian food and desserts. Well priced with a 50% discount for hotel residents.
5
Have frequented this restaurant lots of times. Food is good, and service is excellent under the manager, Mr Zakaria. They have one-for-one deals for credit cards too.
Homely and cosy setting. Makes you feel like you have travelled back in time to ancient Bali.
4
Surprise to run into this restaurant last Friday when having a seminar at Furama Riverfront Hotel. I am impressed by quiet and nice deco ambience. Rather authentic Indonesian's (Balineses) cuisine. I was introduced to taste " Soup Buntut Sapi" ( cow tail soup) an it is amazing !!!. The rendang chicken and durian penget also very tasty
4
The spread is very heartwarming. That's the best way to describe it. Even with it being located in a hotel, the ambience is as warm as being home with loved ones. The food is above average and they've been having a promotion for quite a while now for selected credit cards (one for one). That comes up to about $60 per couple. That's a steal for buffet in Singapore. Enjoy!
4
I have been to this restaurant at the Furama several times. Food is good quality and very interesting. It must be lovely for anyone who is homesick for Indonesia. Great variety and many items that are unusual to non-Indonesians. Staff are helpful and mostly just let you get on with helping yourself to the buffet. Tucked in a corner of the hotel - very cosy
4
A friend took me recently to lunch at the Kintamani Restaurant at the Furama Riverfront Hotel in Singapore. It's been quite sometime since I last dined there but I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic Indonesian dishes on the buffet. All the favourites were available and we have a throughly enjoyable lunch. Too often I have been disappointed by restaurants that fail to be consistently good in their food quality and service. Kintamani has held it's high standards. For me this was a refreshing re-find, especially when you have Indonesian friends visiting and they look for authentic Indonesian food. The restaurant is also Halal certified and has an adjoining Prayer room to cater for it's Muslim clientele. mY recommendation... for true Indonesian taste, try Kintamani
1
I went to this resturant twice in March The first time the food was edible but extremely average with a narrow choice.The second time was a dreadful experience firstly every dish was room temperature ironically enough the water was warmer than the dishes. The rice was hard overcooked and cold the beef curry was unedibly cold, the salad limp. All that was left of the lamb on the bone was fat and gristle and that is what I was given I complained to the food and beverage manager and he seemed nice enoughBut this resturant needs a complete overhaul.
5
Excellent Indonesian buffet with lots of choices for meats, vegetables and desserts. Not cheap, but very good food and if you are hungry; all you can eat
5
Excellent atmosphere, always busy and popular.
Great selection of food on offer, the staff are very helpful and will explain all the dishes and make suggestions.
5
Enjoyed two excellent Buffet meals of authentic Balinese food. Interior decorated in traditional style. Great selection of food including sweets. Empty plates removed promptly by pleasant and friendly staff.
3
went here to this Furama Riverfront Kintamani indonesian food on a friday We had a company bonding there, the food here is all indonesian, but not truely indonesian. The food choices are real limitted.The staffs are always looking moody and serious, no smiles from them, ( the ladies ) i mean. The lady supervisor or always serious and not friendly.we were here for the dinner and cost about 50++. the satays ( meat in wooden sticks ) were soft and not grilled to perfection..totally, the request for lime juice in jugs were turn down as we were in a group.overall this place is not recommendable . needs alot of improvement in food and staffs quality
4
I attended a conference at the Furama hotel and had lunch at Kintamani. While not as abundant as other buffets, the Kintamani lunch buffet had a good selection of dishes and I liked most of the options. The Satay was outstanding. I also enjoyed the Chendol dessert which I have not seen at other lunch buffets. Nice decoration as well
3
If one is to pay $40+, one will feel very shortchanged for sure. The food variety is rather limited and it won't take you long to try a little of each item. Quality wise, it was okish. Nothing to shout about. Unless you are patronising because of some one for one credit card promotion, I say give it a miss.
2
This restaurant is located within the Furama Riverfront Hotel. We opted for the buffet and were very disappointed as most of the dishes on offer were, at best, lukewarm. At the advertised price of $S55 a head, this could not be considered value for money. When asked whether alcohol was available, staff advised the restaurant did not have a license. I can understand if the reason was cultural or religious, but for restaurant in a hotel of this standard not to have a license is unbelievable
4
The restaurant is located inside Furama Riverfront Hotel. I have visited the restaurants a few times for dinner.The buffet spread for dinner is enjoyable. There is a coffee machine where caffeine drinks and hot chocolate is available and they are included in the buffet. I always look forward to the noodle station where we get to prepare for ourselves. It feels good to be able to control the amount of noodles we need and also the ingredients that we love to include more or less of =)My mum enjoys the desserts corner, given her Indonesian self. She loves the durian paste at the desserts corner and would always take more than one serving. The service standard is good and the staff are attentive. I would definitely visit the restaurant again
4
we have some Australian visitors who are staying at the hotel where the Kintamani restaurant is located, we decided on the buffet and we were not disappointed at all. the food was very fresh, a lot of variety and very tasty as well, service good and the dish that stood out was the Beef Rendang with the yellow coconut rice. only disappointment our Australian friend had was no beer. but it was not an issue in the end when we discovered that in house guest got a 50% discount on the total bill. so all up win-win for al
4
There are quite good variety of indonesian food. As I remember, They provide chicken and beef satay, butter prawn, beef rendang, chicken curry, veggie curry, diy laksa, diy gado gado. Few types of crackers, great variety of kueh (traditional indonesian food like kue lapis and cake lapis 'layer cake'). Their dessert such as cendol, green bean soup, durian paste and ice cream taste not bad also.They have some variety of drink and fruits also.Good and friendly service staff.Ambience inspired by bali but not the food
3
I am not sure how authentic Indonesian cuisine tastes like but I felt this was average. Beef curry could have been more tender meat. Desert and starter spread was good.
4
Good evening buffet. Plenty choice of Indonesian cuisine. Clean restaurant with helpful staff. The price for the buffet quite reasonable.
3
Not overly impressed with this place food was so bland and no taste. The choice was limited to Indonesian food which it would be given the name. The square was much better and would make this my preference.
3
no wine.This was a surprise. Limited selection, already cooked.Baskets of food to take lid off and self serve.Empty and quiet, but staff were helpful.Maybe we went too early but the whole place seemed remote and a bit unused.Wish we had gone elsewhere.
4
Me and my colleagues went here recently and the ambience was nice to enjoy a perfect meal. I love Indonesian cuisine, and dining here was one of the best I had.
4
sitting at the bar, and chatting with the barman who happened to mention this place. Decided to give it a go, and although I've never been to an authentic Indonesian restaurant before. The buffet looked real good, and yes it was surprising . The flavours and dishes were something that I've never tasted before, and I do travel a fair bit.Well it was that good the I may go back there tomorrow as its my last day in the area for this trip.The one thing to note is they do not server alcohol 
3
Went to Kintamani for their buffet lunch yesterday. The restaurant was on the 3rd lvl of this hotel. Upon our entry, we found the restaurant to be quite cosy with dim lightnings to fit in the ambience. We were immediately greeted by 1 of the staff and shown to our seat. There are a few varieties of each selection - salads, main dish and desserts. There were about 4 salad types, 1 noodle station - laksa and 1 gado gado station. There was 1 station for the sup bontot and the main dishes consist of satay, rendang, chicken, prawn, fish, squid and veges. There were also varieties of fruits, desserts, ice cream, goreng pisang and few indonesian desserts. Not forgetting few options of crakers and a coffee and tea machine. All the food taste good and food were quickly topped up once it's running low. All the staffs were quite attentive. However, I do not find the price worth of the variety provided. When you compared to other hotels similar priced buffets, they have much more variety and options. We were lucky cos we had a 1-1 promotion which makes it quite reasonable for us at $53 for 2 person instead of $53 for each person. They also do not have anything special for anyone celebrating birthdays. A slice of cake or something would be nice especially when asked few days in advance. That said, at the price Im paying for the promotion, Im satisfied with the meal that I ha
2
Dine together with my colleague during lunch time at their promotion 1-for-1.For the ambient, it is nicely done up with the authentic look........nice setting.....That day, I came with 10 of us, so the staffs pretty much had to arrange the tables and chairs to suit....their service were good.....However, the selection of food was not as good as I expect it to be....no satay and other sambal food etc......quite disappointed at that point of time.For the value, if not for 1-for-1, the original price of S$45++ without promotion, I will not go for it.I go for the food selection and quality....but apparently...there's no wow factor for me in their food at this point...
4
For a taste of authentic Indonesian cuisine, I highly recommend this intimate restaurant. I was there on a Saturday evening with my partner, and was it ever so crowded. The folks just kept walking through the door and I counted myself lucky to have had the good sense to make a reservation the day before.It is located on the third floor of this hotel and knowing that this hotel has been around a long time, do not be surprised at how this gem of a restaurant shined through. The decor is typical of an Indonesian-themed restaurant, with faux-carvings and stone sculptures adorning the walls and placed in niches. Wooden decorative pieces hung on the walls. All this is important to give the customer a sense of authenticity. The real deal is the tasty food and what a selection they have! Gado-Gado, Devil's Chicken, Satayand Sayur Campur are among the many delights that will satisfy the tastebud. There was one glitch though. I had asked if anything could be done for a birthday celebration when I made the reservation. The lady on the phone seemed to ignore the question altogether and instead mentioned the 1-for-1 promotion they have. I guess that was their way of celebrating a customer's birthday. Nevertheless, I did not let that ruin my sumptuous dinner. Bon Appetit
4
With all due respect to most Indonesian restaurant abroad, but I rarely found good Indonesian restaurant. Most of them out there was either too sweet or too tasteless. The real Indonesian food should be spicy and tasty.And I found the authentic Indonesian restaurant here in Kintamani. That's why I love to go back here
4
Excellent Indonesian Restaurant... It was a pleasant surprise to find such a good restaurant at my Hotel (Furama Riverfront)
1
The buffet here is horrible. One of the worst buffet that I ever had in my life. The only thing decent is the satay and prawns... Other than that, horrible....
4
A nice simple place for Indonesia food with family.
They constantly runs credit card promo too.
Very value for money.
4
Excellent Fresh Grind Chilli, Mango Salad and Vegetables Curry! Worth going though need to deal with crowds.
4
This place doesn't look anything flash, but the food is the real Indo deal. Very good satays and beef rendang. No alcohol, no character but impressive food. Worth a try.
2
3 years back, I had a company lunch at Kintamani and it was fantastic. A year back, I had my wedding at Furama Riverview and my guests absolutely loved the food which was partly served by Kintamani. Yesterday, when my husband and I went back there again as we had a 1-for-1 buffet voucher, man, were we disappointed! The service provided was bad! I asked one waitress for a dessert spoon after searching for it for about 3 minutes. She merely just pointed to a distance and said it's there, on a gold napkin. The restaurant wasn't busy at that time. Couldn't she have brought me to where the spoons were, or better still, said that she will help me take one? In the end, I still couldnt find the spoon!As for the food, it was just chicken, prawn, satay, beef rendang, laksa... nothing worth the tab of $50ish per person. Huge disappointment
5
We decided to have dinner here. We had never eaten Indonesian food so thought we would try it.We didn't know what sauces went with what foods so asked the waiter, Ariel, who was serving us to explain. He was wonderful. He personally walked us through the whole buffet explaining what was what and what sauce went with it. Made the meal a truely enjoyable experience.I would like to express our sincere thanks to Ariel for turning what could have been an ordinary experience into an absolutely wonderful memory.
4
I have been to Kitamani Indonesian Restaurant three times and I can say the food is nice. The Indonesian fish cracker goes well with the satay and peanut sauce for gado gado. You have a nice spread of Indonesian food fare that include Indonesian rojak, satay, fried fish, chicken and squid. The desserts selection is good with authentic Indonesian Kuehs, cakes, fruits , ice creams and chendol. The salad bar is good with fried bean curd and cabbage for the gado gado. Ambience for dining is cosy and is set in an artisitc Indonesian decor dining experience, really gives a cultural dining feel and experience
4
The buffet dinner included many choices, with Indonesian themes. I was there as part of a large group of 1round 30 people so that the ability to be in a separate room was helpful, too. Some dishes were very nice, especially the rendang and some of the sweets (even if some of the latter did not seem Indonesian!). The food was not very spicy hot, mostly, except for a couple of the dishes (which might have been better described as spicy, for those with milder palettes?). Everyone seemed to enjoy the meal and had a range of different 'favourites', which probably reflects the wide choice on offer. Pleasant ambience
4
Went for the buffet lunch with colleagues. Seems like everyone else in the packed restaurant was having the buffet which is priced at a reasonable S$30++. Tables were tightly arranged and we had to squeeze through other diners to get to the buffer spread. The food range was wide enough and I particularly like the beef rendang which was was full of gravy. Chicken and mutton satays were average and the peanut sauce was bland and disappointing.
