Decent food - the set lunch menu was new.
slightly dirty cutlery - had remains from the previous use. The clean cutlery also looked very worn out with many scratches.
good service - staff is very attentive

Second time here; food was pretty consistent. Wait staff were courteous but a bit overenthusiastic in clearing plates. We finally left the place at 10pm cos they were waiting to go home.

We went to this new restaurant during the off peak hours for a birthday lunch. Since it is off peak, service was great! We were a bunch of 8 dining that day and all was really good.

Had lunch with my Buddy last week. Both of us had the set lunch and we both agree that the food was excellent. The only feedback we would give is the portions are rather large, and the main course took slightly long to arrive at our table, not a deal breaker, though. Otherwise, experience overall was excellent

This restaurant has some items on the menu which is good value for money like the set lunch for 18++. The beef burger comes highly recommended here. It is a calorie splurge but well worth it. The salad served with the burger is also fresh and delectable. They have both indoor and outdoor seating where one can smoke. Happy hours go late into the night till 10 PM which is probably the only place serving this late. The location is a bit obscure inside the building opposite ARC. But once you find this place it is well worth a visit. The staff is friendly and the food is brought to the table without much a wait time, but this may change if the place is full up. The decor is pretty good and the place has a positive vibe with plenty of natural light during the day time. Try their mock tails as well if you are avoiding the alcohol. The music playing in the background is maintained at a decent volume which doesnt drown out your conversation. Some of the barbecue options may be expensive especially with the ++. Its not a cheap affair here but once in the while, to the enjoy the food and ambiance this may be well worth the splurge

The food here was delicious.We ordered:Crab balls with special chili Sauce - Damn good, chili was terribly addictive Grilled octopus leg: Nice char, super juicy.Chicken thigh skewers: I must learn how the thighs remained so juicy!Prawn risotto: XL prawn was delish. Risotto needed some black pepper to bring out the taste

Octopus was huge but just didn't seem right - perhaps a little undercooked or just too tough. Jamon platter was small. Fair price for drinks but they were served very slow.Lots of people smoking in the outside area - avoid it if you want to eat there
