There is always a queue at this stall. When I visited on a Monday afternoon, there was 17 people already in line. Fortunately, the queue moved fairly quickly. The noodles were nicely done, and topped with the usual starchy lor mee gravy. The noodles were came with pork belly, egg and fried fish. Customers in the queue were noted to order extra portions of fried fish and chicken cutlet. Overall, it was an enjoyable bowl of noodles especially when vinegar and garlic were added.

This stall offers Lor Mee, with a recipe from Ma Bo in Malaysia. They have several options for Lor Mee and on this occasion, I ordered the fried fish version. You can choose your noodle type and I opted for yellow noodles with thick vermicelli noodles. After the noodles are cooked, its placed in a bowl and thick starchy gravy is poured over it. They then added half a half boiled egg and fried fish pieces into the bowl.I then added vinegar, cut chilli, chilli paste, coriander and minced garlic as condiments. I stirred the noodles and ingredients together and tucked in. The fish were nicely fried and doesn't taste soggy even when its been dunked into the starchy gravy. The vinegar and minced garlic gave the dish a nice flavour.You can cut back on the chilli and garlic if you are not into spicy food. Try it
