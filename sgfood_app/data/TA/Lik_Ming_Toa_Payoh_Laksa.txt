This is a hidden gem located in a quiet, sleepy part of Toa Payoh. Not sure how to describe it but the laksa gravy is rather light, a bit sourish and not “lemak” (coconut milk laden) at all. You gotta try it to ❤️ it!

My favorite laksa in Singapore. The gravy is thick and flavourful. When add their special home made blend of chilli will elevate to another level.

This place is on my Laksa lists for a year. Today I went to this place for lunch. The owner and his wife seem very friendly. I ordered Laksa 4$. The bowl was huge compared to other Laksa places I have been to on the same price or higher. The soup was thick, full of condiments and flavor. Lots of topping such as fresh shrimps x3, uncountable cockles, several fish slides and uncountable tofu slides. All of topping was fresh and tasty. The noodle cooked perfectly. Definitely I will be revisiting this place in the future. Location : only 8 mins walk from Braddell Mrt station.. Easy to find and lots of other eating place around this area.
