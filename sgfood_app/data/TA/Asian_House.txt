Many great meal choices with fast friendly service. Clean, convenient and affordable. This little restaurant hit the mark for us, hungry and in a hurry so suited us perfectly.

This fantastic place is a little hard to find, but has the best variety of food and the best coffee in Singapore, we were craving for a good coffee and found it here.The food is varied and plentiful, you can get scrambled eggs on toast which we could not find anywhere else. The Asian food is first class and could not be faulted.The down side it does not open till 10 - 10.30am but most shops in Singapore don't open early either. I am told if you get there earlier, knock on the door

This place serves a wide spread of tasty Asian delights like laksa, hokkien mee, mee goreng and nasi goreng - all easy on the wallet. They also serve aglio olio pasta and seafood risotto, which makes for an interesting mix of cuisine! A wide range of drinks are also available here like three layer tea, which tastes great
