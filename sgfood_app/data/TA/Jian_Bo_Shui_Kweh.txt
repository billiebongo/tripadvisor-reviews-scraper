Recommended by friend and purposely make a trip to Tiong Bahru Food Court for a try. The rice cake is soft and smooth. Yummy. A must try in Singapore!

The shui kueh is soft, springy and nice. The chai bo (Pickled radish) is tasty and given generously.

Expect to queue for 10-15 min minimum to savour one of Singapore's food icons! Definitely worth the wait. Smooth Chee Kueh's topped with a veg garnish dissolve in your mouth and glide effortlessly down your throat. Yummmmm!

The attitude of the service staff is TERRIBLE! This old woman when asked if she put chilli to our food, she just replied rudely, 'No I am not giving it to you because you didn't answer me when i asked you." Not only were there people standing in front of us in the queue, it was very noisy in this market place and she wasn't even looking at us when she asked.We were stunned by this aggressive and rude reply of this staff (the elder lady who seems to be the matriarch of the business).There are so many Shui Kueh stalls in Singapore and all taste similar, we will never buy from this stall again

Dunno why the hype. Chilli soo soo chay po too greasy. The rice cakes 水粿 tasted same as any where else in sg. The challenging part is the way the cakes are place...no plates just on paper which is tough to manoeuvre around while carrying it to your dining table

In my opinion, Jian Bo Shui Kueh provides the best version of this specialty in Singapore. Located in the Tiong Bahru hawker centre, it just satisfies. The spice level of the pickled radish is perfect. Get there early. You will have a wait in line after 11:30 or so

The chwee kueh is not pretty but very yummy. No wonder there's always a long queue. Love the chai por and chilli! Never miss this every time we visit Tiong Bahru Market. But parking here is a nightmare. You must be patient to make your rounds until you find an empty parking lot

This is THE place to go to in Singapore for your breakfast fix of Shui Kweh which is basically it is a little steamed rice cake topped with diced pickled radish and is a common breakfast item. It was delicious, sweet and chocolately (if chocalately is a word!) This is Jian Bo's specialty and worth trying at least once. You won't regret it

Allegedly the best Shui Kweh in Singapore - judging by the long queues of locals buying here and my own personal experience I have no reason to doubt that claim. Cheap as chips at SGD 0.40 each, a great anytime snack - we had them for Sunday Brunch, coupled with Prawn Mee from the nearby stall - also allegedly famous in Singapore

~Chwee Kueh served piping hot with dollops of pickled radish in sesame seed oil is simply delicious !~what's changed from the past when they packed it to go in paper within 30mins it would be soaked thru with sesame seed oil, now they pack them in microwavable plastic boxes <less messy>~prices remain the same :
