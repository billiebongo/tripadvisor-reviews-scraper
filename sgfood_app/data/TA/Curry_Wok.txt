Tried it once and I'm addicted!! Their popular dishes taste just right and the curry fish head is not too spicy, just right!
Their fish otah and chap chye are my fav!! Owners very friendly and enthusiastic !!

The set meals include their popular dishes and is generous in quantity. It is also value for money. The owners are friendly and accommodating. They also have set meals for 1 person.

One of my favorite local food places. The owner is friendly and the place is well maintained. The chap Chye and beef rendang are great, I'm not so enthusiastic about their curry though. The grass jelly with lime juice makes an excellent drink!

Wonderful Singaporean food here. Curries, Beancurd skin rolls, Beef Rendang...everything is delicious and the family who runs the place is lovely. No thrills just enjoy the food with a lime soda. Perfect. I have been coming here for years.

No frills good food ... we pack back most times so all one need to do is call and pick-up! Best 'ngo hiang' around and the braised trotter is artery-clogging good! Other great dishes include their fish head curry and the 'otak-otak'.

Simple Fare Served With FlairLunch for 3 persons. Fragrant steamed rice. A piping hot bowl of curry fish head. Sambal belachan for that much needed kick. Pork chop strips garnished with peas, onion and diced carrot.The curry fish head came loaded with gravy goodness and veggie galore. Brinjal, tomato, lady fingers - bobbing up and down spicy magic. Unforgettable

If you're looking for a casual restaurant serving authentic home-cooked local Peranakan fare in the Bukit Timah area, this is it! They serve excellent fish-head curry, otah-otah, braised pork trotters, chap chye, sayur lodeh, prawn omelette, accompanied by a variety of local desserts and drinks. They also have set meals for 2 to 8 people. The owner, his family and staff are friendly, helpful and patient. Expect to pay about $10 to $12 per head for lunch $12 to $15 per head for dinner. Ample parking within 100m at Crown Centre or Coronation Plaza. There are 10 tables indoors and 2 more outside which gets quite full on weekends

Excellent service by owners who customised the curry fishhead to my foreign guests preference. They changed sliced fish for fish head which my European friends were not used to eating.However, advanced notice has to be given. The bean curd dish with century egg was a unique dish for my guests, curry was made to suit their less exotic taste buds, chap chey ( stewed cabbaged ) was nice and savoury, lor bak ( braised pork knuckles) was soft yet of an exciting texture, lime soda was refreshing and yam dessert was to our delight a good replacement for western ice-cream. If you happen to be in Singapore and would love something local yet affordable, give them a try. They will not disappoint you with their good selection of authentic paranakan delights.Enjoy!

We ordered the Set B, which had fish head curry, ngoh hiang, stewed vegetables and a stewed pig's trotter. We also included an order or otah. All I will say is that dinner that night was excellent and everyone enjoyed the food. Portions were enough for four people, with some food leftover.Total cost was $64, which was quite reasonable

had not dined at curry wok for the longest time. it is located next to thai noodle house at coronation arcade.used to like the great value set which included fish head curry & 元蹄 (stewed pig trotter). i knew the prices had gone up a few years back. anyway i went with sis & b-i-l & a chinese friend to try it on 6.2.2014. the set, now S$56 (+1o% service & no GST), included the pig trotter, a small fish head curry, a ngo hiang & a chap chai dish.the pig trotter was really very good, very tender, gelatinous w/o feeling too oily 肥而不腻, quite excellent! for comparison, i would say it was equal or better than the S$28 pig trotter 元蹄 dish at shin yeh.the fish head curry was also very good, however my b-i-l commented this was the smallest fish head curry he had ever eaten, and it was! the ala carte menu said the price was S$22 (S$26 for large). it was more like S$12 (for this tiny size)!the ngo hiang S$10 was pretty good. the chap chai S$8 was another small dish & ordinary.we were greedy so added a sambal sotong (squid) for S$10 ala carte. it was good but portion was too small.overall the food was good especially the pig trotters, and the fish head curry was likewise an excellent dish if it came in a more decent size. it was too expensive at S$22. as we took the set for 4pax, the total bill came to about S$77 w/o drinks (just water), so it was not really expensive but it was also not any special value. likewise the ala carte pricing for the sotong, ngo hiang & chap chai – ok not great.i would come back for the pig trotters though when i have the kakis.

Mum's not cooking? This is the place to head for. Good food at fair prices. The chicken curry, the beef rending, the ngoh hiang are all very good. A definite favourite. Service is speedy and generally polite.

Good home-cooked local food.
The sets have a lot of value.

This block of Coronation Road is a row of good home-cooked eateries - Curry Wok, Penang Kitchen, etc. Nothing spectacular, just very good Singapore/Nonya home food (fish head curry, kang kong, nhgoh hiang, braised pork knuckles, etc). Polite service, even when they are busy with tour groups
5
This is one of our family's favourite places for home cooked style meals. Food is always delicious and prices are reasonable. The set meals represent good value if you're not sure what to order and we always overeat when we come here! It is a no frills restaurant set in a residential area, it's suitable even if you need impress overseas visitors as you're getting the 'real stuff'or as close to it as possible for local home style cooking

Price is good. Must order the following : beef rendang, curry chicken, NGO Hiang, braised pork knuckles.best white fungus ako era dessert for only 3 sing dollars. It's refreshing. You can spend as much as 56 sing for food good for 5-6 people. You may reach them at 64648878. Our friend brought us here and it's so good

We often visit this place. The food is nice, price is reasonable and the place is warm and cozy. The staff is very attentive and provides good service. We've tried almost everything in their menu and they are all good. Even their desserts are good. I wish they would offer more variety of desserts

This place serves fantastic Peranakan food at reasonable prices. Healthy portions and the curry fish-head, kong bak pao and ngo hiang are a must-try.! Good service by the owners, all smiles and always going around to see if everything is ok. Weekend crowd is very good and yes do reserve a place if you are worried that you may not get a place. Everything used for the dishes is fresh

We ordered the set for dinner, and it was well received by all. The fish head had the right amount of hotness and acidity and the fish was very fresh. The pork knuckles came in a slightly sweet sauce but went very well with the rice. The ngoh hiang rolls - well, we just wish there were more than the two rolls! And all for the price of $50. This was not the first time we had ordered, and will certainly not be the last! Don't expect too much at the premises though - it is quite small and can get very crowded. But the food is worth it
5
This is an unpretentious and cosy little place that serves fantastic peranakan and local food at reasonable prices. My favourites are the curry fish-head, the kong bak pao and the ngo hiang. The service is also very good as the owners take pride in their food and are sincere and eager to please the customers.It may get a little crowded on weekends; therefore, reservation is recommended.They do take-away as well. In fact you can call in advance, order your food and later pick up the food along the road outside the restaurant (without having to find a parking lot)

yummy nonya food..

Home style nonya food. Good flavours and friendly service. Most of the dishes are pretty good.

Simple and classy, using fish sauce, for example, instead of soy sauce for fried greens. Best home cooking place that I know.
4
The fishhead curry is lovely. The place has a very homely feel, and the food is fragrant. Try the fish head curry, ngor hiang and sambal kangkong.
4
Home cooking at its best! Try the ngoh hiang, oxtail curry , fish head curry, hainanese pork chop, chicken curry and ter kah ( pork trotters in vinegar). Very good value - esp if you are a student.

Good Peranakan-style food pork trotter at reasonable prices.
Although I prefer deep-fried pork knuckle.

Great-tasting home-cooked hokkien fare. Mmmm....

yum yum!

Small and unpretentious restaurant serving good Peranakan/Hainanese food. Friendly service in a homely setting. I loved especially the otah dish and ngoh hiang. My teenaged kids loved the sayuh lodeh and curry. Worth a visit but be warned that the restaurant is small and seats are limited
5
Every single dish here is good - from the vinegared pigs trotters to their otak to their rendang. Curry Wok's fish head curry is to die for and what's more, they're exceedingly generous with their brinjal and ladies fingers. The food is top quality home-cooked fare and if you're lucky, you might actually get to enjoy their savoury minced pork beancurd soup which makes its appearance from time to time. Such good value. They also cater
