Had the 3 course semi buffet lunch - choose a main course and enjoy free flow appetizer and dessert. Main course - laksa fried rice (highly rec), rendang chicken, grilled halibut (mash potatoe is amazing) and seafood horfun (worst horfun I ever had, bland and tasteless). On the side note, the prosperity yusheng was beyond expectations!! Thick and huge slices of salmon, crispy crackers, juicy and fresh veggies. Yumyum!!! Email them to request for menu. Appetizer - rojak station, salad, some cold dishes. The cold soba was super good. Dessert - 8 types of cakes but none impressive. 8 types of ice cream and all are pretty decent. Heard the jackfruit is a must try. Lots of childhood gummies.

Review by DrSim001 (Dr H.C.M. Sim). Good Food. Good View. Tourists should Visit for Lunch or Dinner. We had the dinner buffet on Sunday which is cheaper than Friday or Saturday. It is not cheap but food spread is decent and service is quite good. Air-conditioned. We took a table next to the windows. Tourists will get a good view of Orchard area. If you go for dinner, be there at around 6.30pm so that you can see the view. At night, the view is not so clear because of the darken window panes. Regards DrSim001 (Dr H.C.M. Sim

Great Food, Great Place, Great Price, What more can you ask for? Have been going there for years and somehow, despite going to other buffet restaurants, I still keep going back
4
We had a Lasalle gathering at Makan@Jen, this was the first time we visited surely not going to be the last. The seafood were so fresh and we love the atmosphere there too. The staffs were very friendly and helpful too. Will surely go agai
3
We had buffet dinner with family members near the year end and the restaurant was still serving the Festive buffet at that time which included festive roasts and turkey. The international/western selection was good but the asian selection can be expanded. Also there was no refill of the dessert section even after we've requested for it, so that may be an area to improve on. Overall we enjoyed ourselves and the buffet
4
Good variety of food and nice coffee! Kids will like the dessert corner. The staff service is good too
4
Makan@Jen did not disappoint! I tried the seafood dinner buffet on 23 Dec and was very pleased with the freshness of the lobster, oyster, prawns, mud crab and slipper lobster (aka crayfish). The lobster was huge and had thick, succulent meat. The oyster was creamy and silky. The grilled prawn was perfectly cooked and sweet. I didn't like the way the mud crab was prepared... I think it would have been better served with black pepper, salted yolk or chili crab sauce. The scallops were large and plump too. The roast beef was a let down, though; I thought the one we had in the Club Lounge was better. The turkey was also very dry. Thankfully the desserts like pineapple sorbet was yummy
5
Spacious and lovely ambience. The was a lot of choices of food at the buffet. We had a great dinning experience.
1
Five of us came for the afternoon tea, but left very disappointed and felt shortchanged. The food was limited in variety; most of the hot food was cold and not tasty. As it followed very shortly after lunch, some of the empty receptacles were not replenished till almost an hour later after the afternoon tea had started. Cutlery such as ice cream spoons and bowls were also not replenished until an hour after the afternoon tea had started. There were very few waiters and waitresses present, and they looked visibly overworked and demoralised. The contrast with the buffet lunch when the hotel first started could not be more stark. Little wonder that while other afternoon teas elsewhere are so popular, this afternoon tea was practically empty. And to think the hotel is part of the Shangrila group
5
The cold seafoods are very fresh and ambience is very nice and relaxing. The service is great too. Thank
5
We went them with our kids for lunch. Kids pay 1/2 price, and even free for the younger ones. The buffet is simply gorgeous and delicious. All kinds of food, indo, Chinese, European (nice cheese and bread choice), Japanese... The staff is really nice, kind and considerate. They are absolutely kids friendly beside this. Last time we went, it was the birthday of our older, and they brought here a cake with candles, and some of the staff came to sing. Really Singaporean way, but such a nice attention. We love going their for a quality food and moment together
4
Be there early and make sure you reserve as the restaurant is busy every weekend. I like the layout of the restaurant as it is spacious with a good view of the Singapore skyline. You can even dine al fresco. The pepper crab is the piece de resistance and this does not get replenished a lot which is a downer. Kids will love the dessert stations for sure. And the staff are courteous and polite. Kudos to them

We ordered 3 course buffet - salad, mains and desserts. The salad was good, the mains were average and the desserts were pathetic. Cakes placed in drawer fridges gave it a unique display but this also made the cakes rather hard. Noticed that the cakes were not very fresh as well. Ice cream selection was ok. However, the bean curd almond jelly hardly had any lychee in it. I managed only to fish out one piece from the entire bowl. The waitresses were attentive and cheerful but they seemed understaffed. After taking our orders for the mains, it took forever to come. Reason given was that they had to cook it on the spot. I don't think they could have cooked lamb rendang on the spot. The lamb was dry and tough. The prata that came with it was so-so. The tom yum kuay teow was lacking in flavour. Hardly tasted like tom yum. The best main dish was the baked salmon. Perhaps the chef is better at preparing western dishes.Ambiance at this place was very pleasant and relaxing though. Prices are very reasonable.Would recommend the semi-buffet without the desserts
4
There were a lot of variety to choose from, servers were friendly. They had an extensive dessert bar which my brother loved. The only thing that I would suggest is to have more spacing between each table as it gets quite congested during peak hour.
4
I went there to try their weekend seafood buffet, it was glorious! Because who doesn't love seafood?! Anyway, the restaurant is quite peaceful, I compare it to Carousel Restaurant which can get crazy and too closely seated. I love the seating and the ambience. The price is cheaper than most popular weekend buffets with seafood offerings e.g. Carousel, Triple Three to name a few. Although the options are not as many as Carousel which is fine by me because priority was the seafood. They have standard cold seafood options - stone crab, king crab, shrimps, scallops, mussels and LOBSTERS and OYSTERS - this was enough for me! Apart from the cold seafood they also offer cooked seafood (not so good), roasted beef. A little bit of sushi and sashimi, again just enough options, they have indian and local fares - just enough. The same for the dessert. Given the price point and the seafood buffet offerings, i'm quite happy and content! Plus it's not so crowded and you can have a pleasant dining experience
5
Yayyyyyyyy Awesome service , promotion still on. Great variety of food and nice armosphere. Gonna be back soo
4
the service was good , we were 15min early but still able to go in early. food choice was alittle limited but overall ok
4
Its peaceful to hv a meal there. Not that kind of restaurant thats packed with people. It is also reasonably priced. Food is nice just that some food is cold when it is meant to be hot. Will be back again
2
Cold crab served are very watery inside. Fried cray fish is oily and meat is tasteless. Ice cream counter fridge not in good working condition, serving "almost" melted ice cream. Service staff not attentive, used plates are not clear out frequently. Overall a disappointing dining experience
5
Came here during lunch and had the set lunch menu: Salad buffet + Main course. It costs about $19.90++. Fantastic lunch! Nice salad bar with premium food. Will come back again!
5
Great food, great atmosphere, great service, great value (especially with their 3 for 1 promotion). Worth a try
3
At $48++ per pax buffet lunch promo on a weekend, we thought this would be a great option for Fathers Day family gathering (and added bonus was Chope promo allowing 4th diner to eat free with 3 paying adults). Food variety was pretty okay and decent spread for the price but our lunch experience was marred by a missing baby chair which I had repeatedly asked for at reservation. Not sure where the screw up was (i.e. Restaurant over booked or gave our table to another family by mistake etc) but took them well over 45mins to find a baby chair for us. If restaurant ran out of baby chair, either find a way to get one before our family arrived or let us know early so we can cancel and make plans elsewhere. Those with a 1yo toddler will know, feeding time is hard to control so restaurant need to manage customer expectation accordingly even at peak or overcrowded service period. I maybe able to understand situation and wait for a chair but a hungry wailing todd can't. Hope restaurant can understand that and figure a way to manage customer expectation/experience and operation challenges at all situations/seasons
4
Interesting and affordable main courses at $12.90. Dried laksa noodle featured a huge prawn with laksa sauce on the side - really interesting. Herbal chicken soup with rice had an entire chicken leg. Grilled salmon was good. However, the buffet selections were at best average. A small selection of mainly local cakes and desserts, IMO, not worth topping up the price for. Just stick to the main course which comes with free flow beverages. The outdoor terrace outside looks very inviting for tea and chit chat. They should do an afternoon tea set to capitalise on that.
4
Great choice of food and drink, good value all round for the Saturday evening buffet, visited with friends at the weekend and we all enjoyed i
3
Actually food was not bad , it's just that the aircon was strong and makes the hot food becomes cold very fast 
5
Quality seafood, outstanding service. If you are looking for some serious fresh seafood without tearing too big a whole in your wallet, this would be the right place to go. Focus point is the seafood, hence, you won't find the regular wave of varieties of food, like those of International Buffet style. Quantity is small but with quality.2 of us, with 10% off, the bill came up to $138, not too bad for spreads of lobsters, Alaska crabs and regular crabs (whole, not those chopped into small pieces), oysters, sashimi, prawns, mussels, salad, paella, roast beef, roast pork, cheese etc....and the dessert!!! OMG! Definitely have to try the ice cream! We had yam and pineapple flavour, so gooood! *Mouth watering again!* They actually have yam minced into small pieces, I have not had any like this elsewhere. Oh, and they serve pretty good peach tea too! We had 2 cups each!Overall, out of 10, I would give:-Quality of food - 2 of 2Presentation of food - 2 of 2Service and friendliness of crews - 2 of 2Price - 1.5 of 2Location - 2 of 29.5 points.One of the meals that we thoroughly enjoyed and happy paying. We'll be back! ^
5
This place is big and their buffet is huuuuge! Never seen so much seafood in my life and for this price! Excellent option for a quick dinner, buffet style. Quality was very good and options amazing. Not the most intimate place, but you get what you expect. Definately a great buffet
2
Service was bad. Food was average. Whole crabs were displayed making it hard for anyone to eat it. If it's meant to be eaten, pls cut it to decent sizes. Service staff gave us ugly looks when we requested them to cut crab up. Not fresh either after we tried it. Won't visit restaurant again.
4
On level 10 of Orchard Gateway, Makan@Jen offers a sufficient spread of local delicacies - including ice kacang and local ice cream flavors. Corn ice cream? Try it, like it! Those aside, the roast beef is clearly a crowd favorite. Service staff: attentive, and with a smile. The restaurant has glass walls all around, making for an open and relaxed atmosphere (limited echoing). And it's right at Somerset, so very accessible
4
We've stayed at Hotel Jen twice and on each trip have eaten here for breakfast. Great to see that the level of service at Makan@Jen has not fallen and the variety offered is still great
5
Very Good spread accompanied with good service. Restaurant is very vabriant and clean! Very good for family outing
2
My office had a department lunch here and the main course and half buffet spread were such a disappointment! I had the signature laksa fried rice and it was nothing to shout about. The half buffet comprised salads and desserts only and there very limited choices. Guess the only thing I enjoyed were the durian and jackfruit ice cream..
5
had dinner on a thurs nite with some close friends. ambience is good, not rowdy or noisy. a nice mix of local n international food spread - ngoh hiang, cold steamed prawns / crabs etc, little pcs of cakes, tea/coffee and soft drink. good place to have gathering
3
Friends booked thru eatigo. Each cost about sgd 40 after 20% discount. Kids below 6 eat for free. Not much variety. Serve mainly local dishes. What worth to eat shall be the crabs and salmon sashimi. Good ambience. Not many people for dinner on Sunday.
3
Since my last review, I had went another few times as I had liked the ambience of the restaurant but noticed the standard of food has dropped steadily. This time I visited on Monday it was quite poor. For seafood on ice, there were only a few spammer crabs lying around. The roast pork was no longer that tasty as the skin had gone soft. There was no more teppanyaki section and in place was a wok of fried salted egg yolk prawns. Unfortunately the taste was only so so. The desserts are still good though. The chendol cake was special and the tiramisu was tasty.Overall,if the standard has to drop because the restaurant had to offer big discounts on eatigo, it is better to do something about it before even less people come
2
Buffet is supposed to close at 10:00 pm but many (many) things were eaten out at 09:00 and were no more supplied. So if you want to have the ability to enjoy, you have to come early (we arrived at 08:00, but it took time before we were seated and order were taken). Lobster, cockles, squids and other related seafood were rubbery.White wine has been served warm, we had to request for a bucket with ice, and request again for some water in it so that wine can be cooled down.Positives: Oysters are awesome and crew is user-friendly
2
This place has good views. The food is just OK with buffet salad and desserts while the mains are served.Its just OK tho. In Singapore Its easy to find better. And you should!!!!
5
Would like to say thank you to the staffs especially Daniel at the cashier counter...All the staff is helpful and friendly.keep up the good work
4
Love the atmosphere, however the foods were cold. Otherwise, staffs and chefs are very friendly and approachable
5
Had valentine's dinner, it was seafood themed. It came with complimentary wine. Lobsters, Crab and Seafood Galore... The service was rough initially, but the pace was picked up. Atmosphere was right for the evening and very causal, the wine was smooth. Music could have been better. We had such a great time that we spent 3 hours, which was a rarity.
5
The weekend brunch buffet was a good mix of local, international and some Japanese delights.
Price is just right. Moce view of Ochard if near the window. Suitable for family.

Last Sunday we wanted to try a new buffet place for lunch, and found the Makan@Jen. With a low price like it showed on website, I knew that we shouldn't expecd too much. We went there in a windy day, and the air con was quite strong. There was no staff outside the restaurant, therefore we walked straight into the restaurant. Though there were not too many customers (not even one third of the restaurant), it still took a while for two friendly waitress to find a place for us. Starting from the first dish, we found that every dish is only lukewarm, except the soup (thanks god!). The chinese white porridge tasted so bad that I had to check with the chef standing behind the food bar if that was normal. Even my son who loves whatever food asked me why the food was so cold there. I talked to another friendly serving lady and checked the reason. She replied that they couldn't keep the food too hot or the food would be overcook. But there is a line for not too hot but still taste good and taste really bad, and I think the restaurant chose the latter one. In a word, the staff is quite friendly (though they all suddenly disappeared after a while, and we had to find somebody to take away our used plates couple times) and the enviornment is quite comfortable - nice view, spacious and not too noisy. Beside that, the variety of food is limited, the temperature of food is terrible (unless you prefer lukewarm food). The deserts are good, except the chocolate fondue is cold and tasteless - guess they added some water into the chocolate so it won't get hard at such low temperature. In a word, if you want to find a nice place for cozy time with friends, or mainly just want to enjoy deserts or won't care about food too much as long as the price is acceptable, then this is not a bad choice. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant

I had been to their weekday semi-buffet lunch twice and I had a wonderful experience on both occasions. Perhaps many people are not very clear on how the pricing works, so I enclose it below:1 Course - S$12.90++ (Salad Buffet or Main Dish or Dessert Buffet)2 Course - S$19.90++ (Combine any two - Salad Buffet, Main Dish or Dessert Buffet)3 Course - S$25.90++ (Salad Buffet, Main Dish and Dessert Buffet all included)I always go for the 3-course option. The choices of main dish rotate daily and are mostly local/asian delights. All taste good! For the salad buffet, they have a selection of pre-mixed salads and a DIY salad station. A selection of breads and cheeses are also available. Sadly, no soups though. The dessert spread are a mix of cakes, tarts, puddings and ice creams/sorbets. Anyone with a sweet tooth will surely love this section - which I surely did. The service is also prompt, attentive and friendly. Overall, the semi-buffet lunch is really a value for money and worth the time and calories
3
Food is decent quality. Service can be better but it's not bad. Only gripe is the variety and range.
5
They cooked my eggs just right - friendly staff that got to know my name. Made me feel welcome every morning
1
Have booked 3 person for a high tea at Makan@Jen on English New Year Day. Gosh...... what a disappointment. The high tea was started at 3:30pm instead. The chef were still clearing the cooking dishes. The food spread were cold and seems all left over from the Buffet Lunch hour. Will never go back there again 
5
Christmas Eve celebration. It provided wide selection of seafood such as Boston lobster, Alaska king crab leg, Canadian oyster, crab and salmon sashimi and sushi. If you are keen on raw and fresh food, its best choice. We quite enjoy it. For the cooked food, it also very tasty and delicious. Thumbs up!
4
the place is very spacious with nice view, food variety not alot but overall still good, but it's too price
4
The spread is small, but the essential items like sashimi, seafood, carving etc are there. Food generally tasty n fresh. However, i do not like it that they replaced the items with inferior stuff once they run out. Eg, Yabbies were replaced with mee goreng, roasted pork with fried chicken wings??? This is really one place where the early bird gets the worm. The place is nicely laid out with tables spaced out nicely so that you do not get a cramped feeling. Dessert counters are all refridged so the desserts remain cold, which is nice. I will like it that they have some choc desserts n even choc ice cream. Weird for such a common flavour to be missing from the ice cream line up. Service is prompt n friendly too. Ultimately, i enjoyed my dinner there
5
Great value for money. Good food, Good price, Good location. Hidden gem ... May not have the widest variety of buffet, or the best quality ... BUT good food for good price at good location is not so common. Am pleased to give a 5 star rating ...
4
You'll see the restaurant just outside the elevators. There are a lot of selections to choose from, especially local dishes.
5
Celebrated mom's birthday at Makan@Jen. Truly for seafood lovers ! Service staffs were smiley & helpful ! My family had a great time ! Will come back again !
3
Went with hubby for the weekend roast brunch. As he's the meat lover and I'm a seafood lover, I thought this buffet would have something for both of us. For the cold seafood, there were the usual prawns, scallops, mussels, and crab. Alas, there was no crayfish. I was fine with the seafood spread, but if crayfish was available, it would have been icing on the cake.However, the roast selection was quite limited though, think hubby had roast chicken and was it beef/lamb. The dishes they advertised in their promotion email, most were not served. Felt cheated. We wanted to try the satay, but it was always crowded. At about 2 plus, finally there was no crowd, but guess what? It was because the satay had ran out! They didn't even bother to replenish and just closed off the station. Needless to say, we were quite cheesed off. The buffet is supposed to be until 3pm, but they closed off the satay station when it was not even 2.30pm. This is the main reason my rating for this place was an average instead of very good. I hope the management will look into this.The food was not bad and the drinks selection was one of the best I encountered in buffet restaurants, so overall, I was quite satisfied. Desserts were pretty good as well. Would we go back again? Probably, if there's good promotion and more roast items as promised
3
Great concept and attention to details in the restaurant. Lovely setting with tables a good distance from each other. The main course was not value for money and tasted mediocre. Staff on that weekday were haphazard with no emphasis to customers needs, in fact it was very difficult to draw their attention
5
really good food and great service, superb staff! Told them that I'm celebrating my wife's birthday at the last minute, but they still arranged a good birthday cak
3
After long fling we were really hungry and lazy, so we tested hotel restaurant. Actually dinner buffet with a sea food was really nice and the wine selection worked also nice. However the prize point was a little pit high
4
Interesting and flexible way of lunching whether alone or with others. Friendly staff eg. Faizal (Manager), Mavis, Vivian, Stella and Kandau to name a few. Spacious restaurant on the 10th Floor offering a great view. Have been coming since October 2015
3
Centrally located, food choices were alright however some were a little too hard and dry, especially the ketupat. Slightly pricey. However I have to compliment the dessert corner for the wide selection of ice cream :) Thank you!
4
Jen Makan is fast becoming my favourite haunt. When you saunter in, you're greeted by some of the warmest service and skyscrapper view (thanks to the rooftop level). This means you generous natural sunlight filling up the place and a swanky and airy feel. The 3 course lunches are absolutely a must. A semi buffet salad and rojak bar is enough to fill you up, even without the mains. The mains is a selection of local favourites and a western option (my usual, in generous servings). Desserts are palatable, local creative interpretations. There's also free flow ice tea and coffee. What's there not to like? My service there is always saccherine sweet, Manager Kandau and blue-haired Vivian complete our experience there. I have just about hauled everyone I know there. Have you
5
I was there for my friend's birthday party buffet dinner. The place really have ver privacy seating and the food that it offer is really worth a visit ! U can choose indoor and outdoor where the outdoor offers different theme cuisine once in a while
5
Had my free breakfast here during our 5 day stay at hotel jen. What can i say, i loved every single food that they served! The staff are super friendly. We will difenitely come back soon!
2
Rather disappointed, food was not re-filled by 1430 hrs, even lunch closes at 1500 hrs.Have to keep approaching staff for replenishment such as popular dish like satay. Juices were not replenished even the tank is empty since 1400 hrs
5
We used to be a regular at other hotel at Orchard and tried this hotel based on friend's recomendation. We were happy with our experience at Makan@Jen. Nice restaurant for family with kids, and with great service. Special thanks to Stella for attending to our needs at breakfast buffet daily and for taking time to find info on places of interest for my son. Will be happy to come back again on next visit and will recomend this place to our relatives
4
I usually go there for lunch but my last visit was for their weekday buffet. Food was good even though variety wasn't that great. The best thing about this restaurant is ambience n service. Maxis' service was great n deserved special mention here. This is a nice place for a quiet afternoon coffee with friend
4
When there for dinner to celebrate me and my son's birthday. A total of 5 and It was Saturday nite and mainly seafood. Good variety and enjoyed doing my own dessert ice kacang and rojak. There were hawker food too and durian ice creams. Ambience was also good too. I redeemed it with my golden circle points and got to still fork out $77. Hence, a little expensive
1
Eating here is terrible. Called themselves as buffet, but selection is very limited. Only 2 indian food, 1 fried rice. 1 mashed potato & beef. Salad. Noodle that nobody serves. Thats it. What kind of buffet rest is this? Reallt not recommended to eat here 
4
Good local Spread with Seafood. Place is big and spacious. If you want to sample the whole Singapore local Hawker Fare, the buffet offers a good spread with live stations, so that one can enjoy the food indoors and outdoors. Hotel is centrally located and finding one's way there is easy, as it is just above Somerset Train station. The Buffet is competitively priced for Singapore standard
1
We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights and the last night we stayed was the National Day so we decided to eat in the hotel for the first time so we could head straight up to the rooftop to watch the fireworks. I don't like spicy food or sea food and from the whole buffet (which was huge but full of the stuff I don't like) I ended up with a poor tasting Dhal curry, chicken rice which was just okay and some puff pastry rounds which were lovely. Thankfully there was a BBQ outside so I managed to get some non-spicy chicken satay which was nice. My husband who loves spicy food would have only given 2/5 so it isn't just me being picky. The worst part other than barely eating anything is that for 2 of us the bill for dinner, one coke light and one tiger beer was 117 SGD which is about Â£66!!! Definitely wouldn't go again if we had anymore days here. There are much nicer places to eat that are much more appropriately priced
4
Celebrated my son's 1st birthday with my family at makan@jen! Food was above my expectation and service was excellent! Especially by Shaun Lim.Place was big enough to hold a celebration, with lots of space for young kids to run about.However, manpower seemed to be lacking with one Chef tending to 3 of the outdoor stalls, satay, Hokkien mee (love it!!) and oyster omelette. But he did go a good job with the taste. Just pity him that he has to round about.I would come back here again for sure. Hotel is good for staycation as well. Thank you for hosting my boy's birthday celebration. :)
4
Was there for a celebration with my girlfriend. Sean make the day for us. Good service good food good place.. Will come back again
5
Have stayed at the hotel few times and have breakfast at this place. They have good spread of buffet and we love their kaya pao. Surprisingly they now have a helpful Indonesian staff to take care of us which is convenient especially for our elderly mother who does not converse in English. Thumbs up for accomodating our needs
5
Looking for Singaporean food delights with Singaporean love for fresh seafood? This is the place! I'm surprised there's such a hidden buffet restaurant gem in the heart of Singapore's shopping heart within Orchard Road. Orh Luah, Peranankan Kueh, Otah, you name it, you got it. Great for family as it has great open space indoor and outdoor area too
5
Thumbs up for Jess! She was very cheerful, attentive, sweet and passionate about her work. Good asset!Food wise was great. Enough for a happy tummy :
5
The food was fresh and the spread is good. And also given personalized service by Mavis Kiong. Worth the price
5
This place is good. The breakfast buffet is a true delight. It's light and airy with pleasant views. Had dinner here also and enjoyed the selection of exotic foods. Try the signature iced tea. It's nice
4
Went there with family (2 6 year olds and a 3 month old) and wife. spread was good. we reached a little late so they had stopped replenishing some of the counters. The hassle was that there is a 3pm high tea that follows the lunch buffet and we were still finishing our late lunch around 3. they shooed us away, practically as chefs were waiting to replace the dessert menu, at the same time making sure the lunch buffet patrons didnt take a helping of the high tea desserts!! so, sneaky ones can try going around 230 and try to double their dessert options! (just kidding). i've also been here on the weekday quasi buffet. unlimited salads and desserts (as options) with a pre-selected main course. i quite liked that too. would recommend both options
5
Decided to try out the seafood buffet here at this hidden gem in the heart of Orchard. It was simply lovely, food variety was just right, taste was good, loved the desserts. Service was warm, and friendly. First time going here with a group of friends, must say it is convenient to get to. Excellent experience overall
5
My second visit back to Makan @Jen on Father's Day 19 June 2016.We got together a group of 10 mixed family and friends to celebrate Father's Day together. A nice Father's Day treat from my Daughter.What A good deal to start dinner with the vouchers bought from Hotel Jen @$390 for 10pax. Really good savings for us. Vouchers can only be used from Sunday -Thursday . Understand that vouchers are available till August only. Thanks to Vivian of Makan @jen who recommended vouchers promotionI wouldn't say that you have a great variety to choose from but paying $39 per Pax was a reasonable deal. I enjoyed the dried Mee Siam and the crayfish dish. Regretfully they ran out of crayfish n had the dish replaced with big prawns . The grilled station was good . Grilled prawns and baby squids were available .. The Roti Prata was good not oily but crisp. It complimented well with the curry chicken . I remembered they had some Spanish dishes for that night. If you love durian ice cream , give it a shot here. We ended up eating 2 rounds of the durian ice cream. If you are looking looking for more varieties then this place may not be the best choice. Well it depends on each individual. As for me, I was happy with the food and company of family members and friends 
4
Went there the other day for weekday lunch semi-buffet to celebrate a friend's birthday. Mains were good, and the salad buffet, although not an amazing range, was good enough for the $7 top-up. I was especially impressed with one of the staff, Jasmine Ng. I had asked another staff if we could have a slice of cake for my friend as it was her birthday but she did not seem willing to do so. Unfazed, I approached Jasmine, who swiftly arranged for that - she got a cake nicely arranged on a plate, brought it over to my friend and sang a birthday song for her. Thanks for making our day! :
5
The brunch buffet was pretty impressive. Great variety of Asian and western dishes which was perfect for a Father's Day treat. Truly enjoyed the mouth watering "laksa fried rice" (with sambal on the side) which is their signature dish. The roast beef, penne carbonara (perfect for kids) was great as well. The selection of desserts, cakes and ice cream was impressive and the service staff was always at hand to ensure you're dining experience was complete! Excellent food and excellent service, I call that the perfect balance!!
5
Excellent food and service. The Laksa Fried Rice is a must to try! We were there to celebrate father's day and he was very pleased. The quality of food and service exceeding out expectations. We will definitely be back.
4
Very yummy food and great service at this dining venue! It never disappoint my expectation as a renowned hotel group. Surely come back for more...
4
The weekend lunch buffet is a good spread with decent western, Japanese, Indian, local dishes and deserts, very reasonably priced and the service is high standard.
5
Amazing Sunday Brunch at Makan@Jen, the food definitely exceeded my expectations. To add on, the team on the ground was always ready to assist and constantly on their toes! Special thanks to Jeremy for making this Father's Day brunch special! Would definitely return for dinner/brunch! Thank you makan@jen team :)
5
Delicious food, excellent service. The staff is excellently trained, bends over backwards to help with any requests. The food is luxurious - laksa, oysters, lobsters, fried rice, etc. And the setting is beautifully updated. Worth every penny..!
5

Makan@Jen's buffet breakfast is very good with a wide range of local delights and western fare that's certainly a great start to a day. The buffet breakfast which was included in our room tariff, was so filling and satisfying that we did not have to eat again until late afternoon.Diners get to choose from a variety of cooking stations, make-your-own salad options, local temptations and international treats, plus not to forget fruits and of course, pastries and something for those with a sweet-tooth too.One mid-week, we also returned to try out their Weekday Semi-Buffet Lunch which is available from 12pm to 2.30pm and priced from S$12.90 onwards.Overall, a nice dining experience

The spread appealed to me and I was thrilled to discover they had a good range of ice cream flavors to choose from. Certainly appealed to my sweet tooth. I had the Signature Laksa Fried Rice and I liked it a very much. Service was attentive and friendly; you'll have no worries having someone to attend to you. They are fast and efficient. Chef Ken was informative and even showed me which other dishes may suit my taste buds. The manager, Faizal, was engaging and his service was top notch. I will definitely come back again

They have rental bicycles for hotel guests who wished to ride around in the heart of the orchard road. I love their healthy salad but will be good if they serve more rockets vegetable and different kinds of salad option. I had their mushroom soup and club sandwiches. They also serve main courses such as laksa, sweet and soup fish, grilled steak, nasi lemak was served with grilled squid, steamed otah, gigantic drumstick, I found their steamed rice was bit prepared by coconut milk. Ice cream counter was too cold to scoop out the ice cream. They have a staff to standby to serve ice cream. Cakes were acceptable.
2
It was quiet when I went there for 3 course set lunch which consists of free flow salad, choice of main course and free flow desserts. I skipped the salad and went straight for the main course. Selected prawn noodle soup thinking it to be the local or Penang style prawn noodle soup. It turned out to be just a bowl of noodles in lukewarm spicy broth, 1 egg and 1 frozen prawn and some Kang kong, completely unpalatable and totally disappointing! Thankfully the cakes were quite good, that's the only good thing about this restaurant. There's always a reason why a restaurant is empty during lunch hour.

Very disappointed, we are staying at the fabulous hotel Jen, the restaurant is part of the hotel.After a very long day of sightseeing, thought that a convenient option would be the restaurant, feeling tired and foot weary.Restaurant was offering a SGD65 pp seafood buffet (when you add taxes this turns out to be SGD 78).However, decided that a a la carte would just serve our purpose - wrong!My wife ordered the 250g steak and I ordered the Norwegian salmon, from the very limited available selections.Both meals came with hot chip (or rice) and cole slaw.Steak (SGD 30) presented medium rare as ordered although about 20% of the steak, was fat.The salmon (SGD 23) was overcooked and dry.There was about a table spoon of cole slaw and the plate was filled with chips.Restaurant was at about 1/2 capacity with most patrons seemingly trying the buffet.Service by the one busy server was slow. We asked for salt and pepper and were provided with paper sachets of salt and pepper.This is unfortunate, as the Hotel Jen is excellent and worthy of a 5* review, however this restaurant just drags down the hotel's efforts to provide great customer focus.Restaurant ? is NOT recommended
3
Understaffed, food variety not a lot. However there was fresh seafood and nice sashimi. A bit on the downside was a last minute request for a birthday cake couldn't be accommodated as they needed much advanced notice. I have been to some other restaurants that were able to do so
3
Found a not too bad promo on the chope app for the buffet dinner here! Firstly I must say, the restaurant was under staffed, but what they lack in numbers they made up for in service! They were very polite, and as attentive as they could be! Really appreciate that. They could use a little more variety for food choices tho. I must add, the chilli crab was cooked with really succulent Alaskan crab. That. Was. Good! The seafood paella wasn't kept very warm. Personally, I particularly liked the Asian lobster thermidor and the grilled prawns!! Overall not a bad place to bring the family with stretching your pocket that much. :)Thanks for reading.Warmest RegardsN

We went for lunch. Price is cheap for hotel and they give free flow of salad bar. They have some options, wine tasting, salad buffet, main course and salad, dessert buffet.It's good place to meet up with friends or business partners. Good for small company lunch to
4
For price paid, it's reasonable in a city area. Came on a Wednesday for the roast meats and there was the suckling pig, Gammon ham, seafood paella to name a few. Enjoyed the black pepper crayfish. The peppery, slightly spicy sauce coated the entire meat which was fortunately soft and not the "rubbery kind".Plates were cleared promptly though sometimes a bit hard to get the attention of the staffs
3
Greeted by their friendly staff, we came earlier than we expected and were ushered to our seats immediately. Tranquil ambience, probably because it was a Monday night. Food is average, limited selection. I had prata, and it tasted like crossiant to me
3
Can here on 18feb with a group of 13 people. Food selection slightly below average, taste of food average. For the price of $40 per pax I think is quite reasonable.

Very nice Yue Shen! Buffet is decently good (can have more varieties though) Their servers could have been better trained in their services and responses to customers. Jen is still at least a 4-5star hotel. Customers would expect them to know the ingredients and its meaning for Yue Sheng. The server was clearly New or a part time student as he is not well versed or understand the meaning of the ingredients clearly. Nonetheless e tried his best to recite it (good job!) I would suggest to provide better training for their staff. A overall decently good food experience!
2
Decor of restaurant was nice, and layout simple. Food selection was not very wide, and within each food type, options were limited eg only 2 types of sushi, only 1 type of sashimi. The meats were also very dry and hard eg roast duck, satay, etc. The dessert table though had at least 6 flavours of ice-cream. The fruits were fresh and nice. That was a rather good end to an otherwise unimpressive meal. Not value for money.
4
This is where the buffet breakfast is available. The staff are friendly and quick to serve. The variety of food is good, first time that I have seen ice cream available for breakfast!
4
Food at night is more for the Asian people ,so if not to liking choose A La Carte ,but again not a big choice for the western people.Breakfast good,there's something for everybody.Theres coffee and tea machines so you don't have to wait to be served.lots of variety of breads
4
Good variety without an overwhelming kind of array. Quality Great. Fresh. Food cooked continuously while dining with changes of some dishes along the way. Price -Good. Design - Spacious. Some stagnant air circulation feel at the back of the hall. Overall - Very Good. Family and for office. Convenient too - but for first timer - you may take a little more time to locate it. More direction indicator will be better. Service -Good. You get table water by the bottles - quick and fast
5
great food , wide selection of food and mouth watering dessert and great service from the staff like sunny, jasmine and Sean, plates were clear fast,had a great time spent there with my friends , the place was relaxing and cosy.I would suggest my friends come and have a meal at Makan@je
4
Makan@Jen is tucked in a hidden corner where there is a nice garden at the back. The service staff are attentive and helpful to our needs. The dishes are really yummy. Value of the dishes are on par with other nearby hotels. Will definitely go back to the restaurant again to try out other dishes.

Unknowingly reserved a table via a third party (hungrygowhere) when i googled for their phone number to reserve only to find out 2hrs later late in the evening when MAKAN @ Jen staff itself called to tell me that their reservations are all filled to accept my "reservations". Was unhappy when i was told if i could reserve for another day which was impossible. Problem was solved eventually after the manager managed to reserve a table for me. So what was an unpleasant start eventually turned out to be a positive dining experience because of their manager and staff service recovery to make sure that we had a good dining service even offering compliments which was a sincere gesture. Now for the food, there was a good variety of meat, from lamb to beef and roasted pork. Seafood section there were the usual crabs and seashells, sliced sashimi and cold cuts. Only one choice of soup and bread. Then halfway throughout the dinner, the soup got changed to a different soup. Desserts were alright, not that fantastic but still good for the price we paid for.Ambience was somewhat of a minimalistic feel and the seats by the windows gives you a bit of the city view of Orchard area. It'd be a nice touch to have music playing but probably it'll be drowned out by the voices of the diners.Staff were friendly, especially the chefs who were manning the food counters even smiling and giving suggestions on which sauces to try. One of the plus points i don't see in other hotel buffetsOverall, the price was worth it especially with the credit card promotions.Preferably to book directly with the restaurant itself for reservations to avoid any hiccups.

Had a bit of reservation when I saw some of the negative reviews. But it was a pleasant surprise on all fronts. The restaurant was playing some club/ lounge music. Some people people may dislike it but it works perfectly well for me. Food wise, the roast pork and the boston lobster on ice were very good. Others were not too bad too. The ice cream though tasted like Magnolia brand (i.e cheap)After meal, my colleagues and I went outside to the open air lounge for some rest. Will definitely come again

An international dishes in buffet is served but not a wide variety. Just perfect for a budget friendly buffet occasions. Best for travellers as well. You can dine in also at their bar located at roof top of the hotel. You can see 180Â° view of singapore.

There was a reasonable variety of food for everyone. The seafood lovers definitely have to go for the crustaceans. They were fresh and tasty. I would say the seafood provided was surprisingly better than some of that provided at other international buffets that I've been to. The oysters were also shucked nice and clean. During the entire course of dinner, none of my oysters had any traces of broken shells or sand in it. Oysters lovers would love this place for the oysters as well. Diners can also look forward to making their own chinese rojak there. The fruit ingredients for the rojak were really full of moisture and it really gave a very refreshing feel when you munch into them. The only regret was that the dough fritters were too hard.What's a buffet without the desserts? The dessert counter provided very interesting desserts that I've not really eaten anywhere else before. For once, I was looking forward to a second helping of some of them.Service was also relatively good. The staffs were attentive to the diners' needs. Thanks for the hard work

Sunday brunch experience was good. The design of the dining hall definitely brings the experience up a notch. Bright, light and seating well-chosen. I had crabs and seafood for 38++, along with a selection of local cuisines and salads and roast duck and pork. Roast pork could be more tender/juicy but the duck was good. The highlight was the dessert spread with ice-creams, scones, cakes and tarts. Coffee from the coffee machines is self-serve. What I didn't like was the ice bucket melted and you couldn't get decent ice for your drinks. Wish the live noodle station featured pasta-to-order and not just one variety of a local soup noodle - one that you can get at far better quality outside for $5. Really, pasta doesn't take that long to cook nor is it expensive. Why display what you aren't serving? Salads were pretty good and different too but sushi offerings need to be better value/done with more finesse. A selection of fresh 100% juices would give more variety to the drinks. I would go back if there was an offer on the credit cards or if I were craving lots of dessert

After seeing some good reviews on Makan@Jen online, I brought my family there 2 days back to celebrate my mother's 50th birthday. Unfortunately the quality of the food was far below expectation and definitely not worth the money that I paid (~$50/pax). I started with the seafood, and went for some clams, crabs and muscles. To my dismay, I realised the the seafood was partially frozen, with a layer of ice around the flesh. This came to me as a surprise because, based on the reviews I had read, I was under the impression that Makan served fresh and not frozen seafood. I am afraid to imagine what their Seafood buffet is like.The grilled prawns looked decent, so I decided to give them a shot. The flesh was cold and rubbery, so I’m guessing that they had been left out in the open for a long time. I was going to try the fish but I saw a customer drop the serving spoon on the floor, then pick it up and place it back beside the tray. A nearby waiter had seen this and I was waiting to see if he reacted. However, he stood by as if nothing had happened. Even worse, there were flies buzzing around the sushi platter. Steering away from the seafood, I was hoping that the local dishes would be more promising. The Laksa was honestly not bad, but it definitely wasn’t anything special. I also tried the Rojak, it wasn't bad too, except for the You Tiaos that were stale and hard. It quickly became apparent that much of the food in the buffet was not freshly prepared. The only food my mother seemed to enjoy were the sun-dried tomatoes, which I’m pretty sure were bought from elsewhere.The dessert table looked enticing, but each item i tried just brought more disappointment. Again, the Kueh was cold and hard, as if it had been let out in the open for days.I am grateful for the complimentary cake that the staff provided although it didn’t taste great. It was a nice gesture and it made our experience slightly better.In short, it was a bad choice of a restaurant to celebrate such a joyous occasion. I will definitely not be a returning custome

Had brunch on a Sunday there. There were some pretty good food i must say, Satay was good, Roast Pork, Pasta. But there were not a lot of varieties
4
They provide good food with good service but the menu is the same everyday so I decided to skip my breakfast on the third day
2
Went there for a birthday celebration last week. Variety was limited, there was only one live station preparing noodles soup.. Thought there would be a pasta live station since there were pasta boxes stacked up but nope. Service was also disappointing, had to clear our plates ourselves most of the time. Even when they presented us with the cake, we were appalled that the staff just gave us the cake and ignored the finished plates on the table. Lots of room for improvement, they need to relook at training the staff here

We had initially wanted to dine at Cafebiz at Hotel Jen at Tanglin as we have visited it a number of times. However, the restaurant was closed for renovations. We then decided to try Makan@Jen at Hotel Jen Orchardgateway instead. We made a reservation for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.The hotel is located on the tenth floor at Orchardgateway. We were glad that window seats were available as I had requested when I made the reservation.There is a good variety of food, like sushi, sashimi, seafood, satay, live station of laksa, and roast meat, among others. Coffee and tea, fruit juice, ice cream with cones and of course mouth watering desserts were available.Our plates were cleared regularly and the staff are efficient in responding to our requests.There is an open air terrace outside the restaurant where you can relax on the couch and enjoy the panoramic view of the skyline.On the Sunday we were there, the restaurant was not too crowded and we were able to enjoy our food in a nice and cosy atmosphere.We have already planned to try their dinner buffet on a weekday with a visiting friend
5
I tried their dinner buffet and I must say that the food is worth the price. I love their seafood choices cooked authentically Chinese. If ever I will be returning to Singapore anytime soon, Makan@Jen will surely be on top of my list to dine (again
5
It's the second time we visited makan@jen for their week-end brunch. No disappointment! Buffet is a mix of local delights and more international dishes. The place is bright, and the prices are also "bright" which means very affordable. 38S$++ and if you like some wine, you have a good choice for 19S$ free flow! They have a huge terrace with comfortable sofas where you can relax and even have your coffee or tea. We will definitely go back for a very relaxing time
5
There is definitely a variety of food in this buffet, from Indian, Japanese, local food like wanton noodles and rojak, salad to BBQ food. Lots of huge prawns in this buffet, barbequed and cooked ones too. Loved the black pepper crayfish. The dessert range is extensive with 8 flavours of ice-cream and peranakan kuehs to western tarts. Overall the food was excellent taste-wise and presentation-wise. The service was good and prompt. They were not many diners though, as it was a weekday night. But for the price, with a 15% discount for 3 major credit cards, it was worth the money. Strongly recommended
5
Awesome breakfasts! Really diligent and helpful chefs who obviously care about the quality of the food they produce. ....Oh and they have self serve ice-cream on the breakfast spread
4
This is my first visit to the restaurant but was pleasantly surprised by the good and nice layout. The kitchen is open concept. The place is bright and spacious. Also I felt my appetites was better because of its innovative and hip design. The spread and quality of the food was good and also the price was reasonable
4
We went on a Sunday dinner (i.e. it isn't the seafood night), thou there wasn't any oysters, the overall food experience was satisfying and overall food was great.
Only grip is lack of staff and the refill for the crabs wasn't really good.
3
This is not a place for gastronomy. But if you just want to have a comfortable breakfast or a quick dinner in the evening, it's just perfect. They also have free flow buffets which can be very tempting for people who favor quantity over quality.
5
Had breakfast here for 2 days. The buffet spread was wonderful! Great selection of drinks. There was Chinese, Indian, Continental food choices. They have the best bacon I have tasted in any hotel!
The staff were very attentive and friendly.
4
the view was nice, the restaurant itself has a great decorations, the food was delicious and have many choices.

First time trying out the buffet dinner at Makan@Jen on Monday night, it was a nice restaurant on 10th floor. The buffet spread was good with lobsters, crabs, prawns and other good food; however, there was no oysters (I guess it was not the full seafood buffet night). The Japanese counter is serving good quality sashimi and sushi. There is a self service coffee and tea counter where we could choose our own tea and I like it. Dessert counter is having nice desserts too.Overall, I am satisfied with the everything except the service was a bit slow at times
3
Dear Makan@Jen,I really would have liked to have given you a good review. Your food was very good. But I really don't like buffets and ala carte was a bit limited. I think you need more staff. Why were the water glasses sitting on the table empty for the whole meal (didn't see any full ones on the other tables either)? Were we supposed to ask? But where oh where were the staff when we wanted them? Why were our plates left for so long? Sure we were chatting, but it was obvious we were done. There is alot of competition in Singapore - are you only counting on the hotel guests

This is our first visit to the restaurant. First impression: place was airy and bright. We had a double birthday celebration and I have requested for 2 small portion of pastry for the birthday ladies. It was accorded with a birthday song from 2 staffs. Food was fresh, sufficient variety and replenished fast. Great selection of coffee, tea and dessert. Staff is constantly seen keeping the buffet area neat and tidy. Clearing of plates was prompt and service was great. Special compliments to the 2 staff who were fresh graduates from Shatec: Xiao Xiao and Jerry. Pricing is reasonable for the value received in terms of food and service. Worth a return visit.Disappointment: vouchers of 10 at SGD380 nett cannot be purchased and used on the spot. 12 hours gap from purchase and utilization must be adhered. Complimentary carpark is not accorded to diners. Discount of 15% applies to credit card OCBC Bank only.
5
Went for the international night buffet. The salmon and tuna sashimi are fresh, and pleasantly surprised to see cold crabs, mussels and prawns as well. The hot spread are typical with bbq prawns, bulgogi pork. Dessert includes nice cheesecakes, macarons, nyonya pastries and usual stuff. While menu is not exactly extensive, the quality is good and service is excellent, probably because the restaurant is half full on a weekday. The outdoor lounge area is also good to chill out too. With credit card discounts, the bill adds up to only $40 plus per person for dinner
5
So many choices at breakfast and lunch, and well spread out. Loved the food variety and quality. Only thing was the food wasn't hot enough. .(temp.

We had been eating at "hawker" stands for several nights and my husband really needed some "western" food. I, on the other hand, was ready to continue my journey into Asian cuisine. We were both satisfied her. The food was excellent, the variety was outstanding. The desserts were so good, both torts, tarts, cakes and ice cream. They even had sweet corn ice cream that was delicious. Definitely a treat
