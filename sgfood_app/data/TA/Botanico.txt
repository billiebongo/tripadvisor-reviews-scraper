I love the serenity of the restaurant and the idea of surrounded by flowers is just whimsical. Had the cauliflower as appetizer and it had a strong taste but in a positive way. Peri peri chicken is a stellar as well.

I wanted to like this place but I didn’t . Service was very slow so we were often waiting and hungry. Food was so-so and I regretted a lot of my food choices. Won’t be here anytime soon.

We sat at the terrace which could have been more beautiful if not for the messy end of the hall. They should block the messy end or clear up the untidy odds and ends in their terrace area. Food and service were competent.

Botanical Gardens is a World Heritage Site with lush greenery and this is the perfect location for this eatery. Lovely ambience but I would have preferred it to be on the Ground Floor. It’s above Bees Knees in the Garage.Loved the wild mushroom latte and cauliflower starter but would give the pork scratching a miss. The sausage ragout, wagyu beef cheek and atas Margherita pizza were pretty good.We tried all the desserts and the choc merlot cake was the best

We pulled up to botanico at 6pm in the middle of an earrh-shattering downpour; not their fault of course and it somehow added to the romance and anticipation of climbing several flights of steps on the upper level of the Garage (which houses) Botanico. We were one of the first to arrive; chose to sit on the 'outdoor' terrace, which, thanks to the pouring rain, now came with a cool but sultry atmosphere. The Wife and I were celebrated our wedding anniversary with champagne and a small meal together. We shared the 5 course set dinner between ourselves. Neither of us usually have dinner so we were looking for just something light to tasty. The set dinner did the job, well almost anyway! Highlights were the starter platter and the tomato salad. Our waitress was lovely and responsive. We even got an unexpected drink and dessert to help us round off the celebration. Thanks for the memories

We were at dinner at Botanico last night. My partner ordered the “t-bone lamb” whatever that was. I ordered 3 appetisers, the calamari, ceviche and foie gras. I believe in calling food by it’s correct name so a diner knows exactly what he’s eating. So, t-bone lamb turns out to be lamb chops. The calamari turns out to be squid. Yes, there’s a difference. But the most appalling was the chef’s idea of ceviche (which should be raw fish chopped & drizzled with lemon). If I’m not mistaken it was probably ice cream heavily infused with belachan. I have not tasted anything so vile. The only saving grace was the foie gras nicely pan fried. To add insult to injury however at 10pm the mosquito spray was automatically turned on. Not a good dining experience but to be fair, lovely waitress who wanted to compensate us with a free dessert. We don’t eat dessert.

This is a restaurant tucked away on the second storey of The Garage, they have a current special three course (two choices per course menu) for the staff of embassies in Singapore from now u til 22 December.It was $28 ++per person and it was delicious. First course is a choice of two salads, the beef cheek for main was a hit, I had the fish and while it was small it was delicious. Dessert was the best little plum pudding with a generous serving of rum custard or a small cheese plate.The service wasvery good, the room and outlook over the green trees of the garden makes it a lovely lunchtime spot

this place is good for a number of reasons but i’d like to start by saying the outdoor air con is amazing. not sure why more places don’t do this, but in 30 degree weather it makes a huge difference. it might make this the best outdoor dining experience i’ve had in singapore. staff were very friendly, and the food was really good - try the peri peri chicken and the roasted pigeon with risotto. we stayed for over 3 hours and only left because they were closing up, so that should tell you something. highly recommended overall!

We stumbled upon Botanico last weekend when out at the gardens and looking for a spot to eat with our 3 year old son. We are from NY and travel extensively and used to eating in some fine restaurants, Botanico is as good as anything we've experienced around the world and is very reasonably priced too. We shared the smoked blue crab starter, then had a pasta dish and beef cheeks for a main- they were all absolutely delicious, very very well executed and fantastic flavors. Our son had the kids bolognese and it was also delicious - not your typical kids meal for sure! The service was also a refreshing change in that it was extremely attentive and high-end. We will be back

The restaurant itself is beautiful but the meal itself was very disappointing. The portions are small and I am talking 3 Michelin star prices for very little food. I am a modest eater but after 2 starters and 2 mains with my Wife, we were both still hungry which is highly uncommon. The mains took more than 30mins to arrive after the starters and the place is only 10% filled. Table next to us ordered a cheese serving and commented that the cheeses were hiding under the bread as they were so small. Suffice to say we won’t be back

This is a Spanish bistro so don't expect an extensive menu and premium quality ingredients. However, as a bistro, they had done very well. All the starters and small dishes we tried were interesting and delicious. The Pork Scratchings and Calamaritos were especially unusual and perfect with wine. The main took around 30 minutes to prepare. They were good but not a Wow. Wine selection was good and pretty reasonably priced(starting S$60) for the good quality we experienced. Excellent service: professional, prompt and attentive. The staff noticed that I was slightly bordered by the direct blow from the aircon and immediately offered to turn down the fan. Wine glasses were were hardly left emptied. They also knew they menu well and made helpful recommendations. Very lovely ambient. Tables were well spaced out that we hardly noticed voice from other tables. Perfect for dates, family and friend gathering. We had an very enjoyable evening

The physical setting of these 02 establishments - Botanico & Bees Knees - is what used to be a colonial - era garage. Nice ! When I made my reservation, I had pictured the downstairs place and was surprised to be led upstairs when I arrived. Botanico is upstairs, and is fine - dine in the evenings whereas downstairs it's uber casual at Bees Knees. But it's alright, am glad to have tried Botanico, even if it was done unwittingly. Creative menu, interesting treatment of ingredients. It was a nice brunch, even if it didn't send us drooling over the moon. The service staff are particularly kind, nice & friendly -- kudos to the crew ! A bit on the pricey side considering what we ate and ordered, but I must say they gave pretty generous pours for their booze !

The Botanico is listed under 'The garage' and when I made booking for 'Bees knees' seeing their menu. When I called to reserve she jist asked if I want cafe or restaurant and when I said restaurant she dint even tell me I was booking for Botanico . So we landed up only to find it was a different restaurant with very limited choices. They managed to make a vegetarian dish but for all dishes the portions were really small . And quite overpriced. Though it was tasty we dint come out feeling full. Definitely not value for money

The first thing we noticed was that it is very loud and noisy. The acoustics are poor and you can hear every table around you. They need to put some wall hangings up and some drapes among the rafters to attenuate and soften this. The wine and drink menu was not presented with the food menu and had to be requested. The Smoked Negroni cocktail went perfectly with the Olives. The Croquettes were extremely tasty. Before we were given our starters we where presented with someone else's main course. This was swifty removed and followed by my main course presented with our starters. This was also removed when questioned. Once we had finished with our starters my main course was re-presented. The scallops were excellent but there were only three of them and not that large. While I agree with their portion sizes which,unlike many are satisfying, but leave space for deserts, and you come away contented but not bloated, I think, at the price they could of added another two or three scallops. My wife's main course did not come - this may have been as a result of two family members having colds and leaving without eating. Their main meals were cancelled but as a result of my wife's meal, being the same as one of the cancelled meals also appeared to have been cancelled. This was mentioned to the head waiter and things were sorted out. When it arrived 15 minutes later, the pork belly was very, very good. Full complements must go to the headwaiter, who having heard it was my wife's birthday presented her with a beautiful, on the house, dessert with the words 'Happy Birthday' on it in recompense for the delayed meal mix up. So we come to the importance question, would we come again? The answer is definitely 'Yes'. The food is good. As a new restaurant, there are some teething problems that I'm sure they will rectify

My husband and I have been for dinner on Sunday evening a couple of times, each time the food has been delicious and the service has been very good. The menu has recently been refreshed - on our latest visit we shared croquettes, jamon iberica and a tomatoe and burrata salad to start. I had lamb with smoked aubergine and tomatoes for main and my husband ordered wagyu beef cheek with parsnip. For dessert we had a cheese plate and the chocolate and ginger pudding. The food was absolutely delicious (the meat was beautifully cooked) and the restaurant has a lovely chilled-out atmosphere - the only minor criticism would be that the cheese plate was not served with enough bread, but more was provided when we asked for it, so not really a problem. We would happily recommend this restaurant.

had a birthday gathering here, lovely ambiance for groups or individual couples. food was promptly served and the service staff were polite, food was quite delicious as well. we had leftover wine from our earlier picnic in the gardens, and they charge corkage should you wish to consume your own wine fyi

2 couple dinner. Ordered the steak, foi gras, char Siew, pigeon and calamari. I expected more from the place especially since it was related to Binomio. Calamari was very salty. The other dishes were decent but not memorable. For the price point, there are tonnes other places that warrant a visit

Review is based on visiting for Sunday brunchBuilding/locationBotanico's location on the upper floor of what used to be garages in the Botanical Gardens is excellent. The conversion has been well done and has created an elegant, atmospheric setting. Do be aware that this is a heritage building and access is via fairly steep stairs.DrinksThe cocktail menu is interesting. Someone has clearly worked hard to create a range which suit the "Botanico" name. Quality is excellent although the smokiness in the drinks containing wood chips needs to be reduced. Service however is poor with a pair of cocktails arriving with a gap of at least 15 minutes between them.The wine list is limited for a comparatively high end restaurant and by the glass measures are small even for Singapore standards. Possible that staff training is an issue here.FoodOverall the balance of the brunch menu is wrong. Large portions of the "extras" which start the set meal and large starters followed by very small main courses then comparatively large desserts.Some dishes such as the Spanish mackerel are excellent, others too bland especially for a menu which is supposed to have a Spanish feel. There is also a curious tendency to add a very lightly cooked egg to many dishes, something which adds nothing. Using the eggs to create a fritatta for the menu would be a better option. A re-think with more emphasis on real Spanish dishes instead of Spanish sourced ingredients could be the way to go.Vegetarians/VegansThe brunch menu is unsuitable for vegetarians and vegan

After a couple of weeks of looking forward to this dining experience, sadly it was disappointing!The outdoor upstairs terrace is nice enough and has a lovely setting for unusual cocktails and good bar snacks. The restaurant itself however could do with more attention, in particular the service. Our waitress did not know the difference between blue cheese and manchego, calling the former by the latter name and then apologising because she doesn't eat cheese. Gruyere was also presented as Comte which she had to correct by going back to the kitchen to ask.Knowledge about the menu was also not obvious. Our lamb tartare and botanico salad starters were tasty but my pork belly main was ok, not memorable, and was served with only some carrot spaghetti. My partner's scallops apparently did not impress, despite the size of them. Finally, the wine waiter did not know what a decanter is, nor what it's used for so I'm guessing a little more training is needed in general. The staff truly behaved in a way that resembled a first day on the job. If this is going to want attract more diners and tourists, it's going to have to lift its game on many levels as the experience does not match the expense.

Yes you heard right - piped cool air for a pleasant outdoor experience in Botanic Gardens in Singapore. Located on level 2 of The Garage @ Botanic Gardens, it is ideal for a sundown drink. You can choose to dine outdoor or indoor.The service staff recommended the croquettes to go with our pre-dinner pinot grigio; and for mains - Pigeon with risotto and Pork belly with a Chilean red. Our favourite was the Botanico dessert - cucumber sorbet, granny smith, coconut foam served with kaffir lime ice cream. It was refreshing.Service was attentive. The house pour white was flat but the staff promptly changed it with a new pour from a fresh bottle
