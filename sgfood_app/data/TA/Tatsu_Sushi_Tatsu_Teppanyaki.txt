It used to be a charming place, but now its a sort of face less restaurant. The food is still good, but the selection is less
5
Amazing food, great saki. We ate a really varied selection of bits, included the dreaded puffer fish. That in and of itself was quite surprisingly pleasant. I ate it purely for the hell of it, I'd heard it wasn't that pleasant. It was actually really tasty. The sushi was excellent, the sushimi as well, although a bit much for me. The squid was also exquisite, and served beautifully, have a look at the pictures.
5
A great spot. We could only get in by sitting at the counter but we got to watch the chefs at work, making their intricate delicacies and that was worth the price of admission! The food was exquisitely prepared and well served. Servers were very attentive. Our sushi choices were so enjoyable, accompanied by sake and wine. What a good choice among many choices in this lovely area

I read many reviews about the bad experience like rushing your meal, bad Wagyu beef and price . However, I have very much different experience. Looked for Jack next time as he will give your the attention you need and I hard to believe such bad quality food would be served as I have been here many times with similar experience. After visiting their other branch at Asia Square 2, visited here with friends to celebrate special occasions. Welcome with friendly staff, sitting at the corner for 5 of us. Variety of teppanyaki to chose from . We are sitting at the counter to see the action of the Chef.. very passionate and friendly to entertain us with lots of food.. Wagyu beef, lobster, fish, scallop , prawn, garlic fried rice is amazingly good. We ordered whiskey and enjoyed so much! The smoke exhaust needs to improve as somehow the smoke was everywhere. Lovely place to celebrate and have good meal with lots to drink..great location at Chijmes with lots of parking space at basement and early MRT too.

Tatsu Sushi / Tatsu Teppanyaki Located at 30 Victoria Street CHIJMES #01-08, CHIJMES, Singapore .Huddled within CHIJMES Complex, Tatsu offers authentic Japanese fine dining cuisines. Well that is the understatement to me it was disappointing and the worst Teppanyaki experience that we have encountered. The cuisine was very expensive and the wagyu beef was frozen and from low quality, it felt like I was eating leather. Service was catastrophe the whole thing very fast to get us out of the restaurant, I can’t believe that Less than 30 min all dishes were served. Overall my worst food experience ever. It was overpriced, low quality food. Extremely disappointing
4
Really enjoyed the food, but felt a bit rushed. I like the Teppanyaki experience and generally it is beautifully paced and an extraordinary dining experience. I was in and out in literally 35 mins could have easily extended it out by simply preparing dishes individually as is generally the rule. Having the same sauce for the prawn and the lobster to me is a tad lazy. To be fair staff are friendly and interactive and the Chefs were fine practitioners of their trade. The food was high standard overall but lacking a wow factor. The beef exquisite, lobster magnificent and fish fantastic. Fell away however with a small average salad and the two pieces of cantaloupe as a dessert was fairly lame when i have been to other places that make this a feature. Its a better than good restaurant but could be exceptional with a few tweaks. Give it a go

Chijmes is a fabulous setting but all the restaurants I had eaten in to date were just average. Not this place. In typical teppanayaki style the food is cooked in front of you. I had silver cod and my friend had beef. Both were cooked perfectly and were fantastic. I also ordered the scallops which were the best I've ever tasted. Good atmosphere for couples or small pairs/groups of friends. I would definitely recommend visiting with a friend or plus one. Dinner for two excluding wine was S$190.
1
The food was served in a rushed manner, with 2-3 dishes all coming at the same time, which is most unlike a teppanyaki restaurant. It’s like the restaurant could not wait to get us out of there. To top it up, we were not even done with our sake yet, and were somehow presented with the bill. It’s not like we took our time as well, since dinner and drinks were finished in an hour. It is hard not to notice that the group of foreigners next to us were afforded all the time they wanted between dishes by the chef. Definitely a waste of time and money. Not going back again
2
I was recommended to come here from my friend in Scotland, things must have changed since he was hereFood ok but speed eating is not my thingEverything cooked at once and thrown onto the plateFar too expensive for what was delivered Couldn't believe how expensive this was for some Wagu beef and a small bowl of rice and some vegetables I expected a show and good presentation NothingThey couldn't wait to get you out and table prepared for the next victimsI didn't realise how expensive Singapore was but even by general pricing this was way overboard
5
Located at CHIJMES, this little place was perfect for a birthday celebration. We were well taken care of by Tony, our chef, and everything was cooked to perfection. Loved that they had Asahi dark beer too! We shared 2 sets + a few a la carte items between four adults (we are not large eaters) and it was proportionally perfect. Will definitely be back
4
Recommend to anyone who enjoys sashimi and teppanyaki. It is small and intimate. Service is good and friendly.
5
Had sashimi which was very fresh, some teppanyaki lobster,prawns and scallops which are very well done too.
4
Dropped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Immediately got a chair out front in the bar. Food was ready quickly, and service was great. Pricier than some of the alternatives, but still recommended.
4
Great teppanyaki. Sushi was not great. But teppanyaki is great. Wines are over priced because of location.
Overall a very good experience
4
The restaurant is located in the Chijmes area. There are many Japanese restaurants and this one is a good one as most are. The food is quite ok. But the Wagyu steak for the price they charge wasnâ€™t so good. It had some chewy fibres which is not expected in this kind of restaurant with these prices. But other food was very good. So was the service. Very friendly people.
1
That was with big gap the worst Teppernyaki experience in my whole life. And I love Teppernyaki and go very often in different locations. The food very expensive even for Singapore and the wakyu beef was frozen and from low quality with lots of tendon inside and it felt like I chewing sole. Really bad food. Second point is they try to make everything very fast to get us out of the restaurant. In 20 min they serve all dishes. Even if we didn't finished our plates they put next dish on it. In general my worst food experience ever. We thought about having a good time with some friends. I can really not recommend this restaurant.A lot of bad reviews shows that I'm not the only one. DON'T GO THERE. Is waisted money. I'm sure you find other one in Singapore
1
It took us approximately 20 minutes to get our teppanyaki dinner served at chef's table. There was no a single sign of teppanyaki experience what was promoted on the Restaurant's website. We were 5 people and ordered wagyu and lobster course each. Two chefs cooked us approximately 100 gram of frozen beef and seafood, small bowl of rice, mushrooms, salad and miso soup. Total with the drinks we paid over S$ 900 and left hungry. It was overpriced, low quality place. Extremely disappointing 
4
We had a really good experience today at the Tatsu Teppanyaki. We choose the menu so we got salad, fish, king prawn, fried rice, meat, soup and dessert. Such good value for money. Food was really good. Very friendly staff, the chef was entertaining and so sweet towards our 8 month old. I would recommend this place for both couples and family's. We will definitely come back.
5
This was a fabulous little restaurant. We came at the right time as the rush was over and the Chef was happy to amuse us. His Teppanyaki was really good. His name was Danny and he provided us with great theatre and the food was excellent. Would definitely go back here any time. Thanks to the staff at Tatsu

Located inside Chijimes, this restaurant has Sushi and Teppanyaki. The fish was very fresh and sushi prepared well. Service was good. I found the prices on the higher side for what you get compared to other places in Singapore with similar quality. The Aburi selections I really enjoyed and worth a try
5
Walked in to the restaurant without doing any prior research and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dishes. If you love Japanese food, I would recommend it. For 2 people, you can expect to spend around $100 or more.
5
Enjoyed the Teppanyaki show and taste, some Teppanyaki could very expensive.. it depends on what type you order
5
dinner with friends,great place to eat.food is fantastic and cooked right in front of you,food is delicious and service is great.

Very good, expensive sashimi and wagyu.
Excellent service. But the beer is a rip off.
They serve you in small glasses when you expect a proper helping and charge you full price.
3
Had the "sushi and tara teriyaki" set lunch. Was average, certainly not as good as other restaurants I know. Service also OK, not particularly attentive, just average. Prices on the high side for what I had. Wasn't bad but there are much better alternatives, I wouldn't go back
5
We really wanted to have teppanyaki while in Singapore, and someone suggested Tatsu. And what a delight!! The restaurant is located in an amazing building and the restaurant itself has a really good feel to it. The food, or in fact, the whole experience in Tatsu was world class. The food was perfect and the staff, whether the chefs or the waiters, were always on top of things.It was food bliss.We will certainly be coming back to Singapore to visit this gem of a restaurant. Its so worth the trip
4
I love the food. Its well prepared, tasty and they have a nice menu with a good list of selection. Be it sushi or teppanyaki, you won't be lacking choices. The chef is friendly and recommendations are usually spot on. Go ahead and tell him/them (as there are two chefs) what you like, and they would recommend according the suitable dishes that would satisfy your cravings and ensure that you would be back for more
3
Stopped by this Japanese Teppanyaki and we had the wagyu beef set and chicken set. Had the Ashahi dark beer recommended which was good. Portions were ok but Beef was a let down. And since the beef was supposed to be wagyu and the desire to have Teppanyaki, the visit was not up to out expectation. Chijmes is a nice and pleasant place to visit in the night. And restaurant is nicely decorated with friendly staff and they even had a sashimi counter at the front booster the overall ambience. But wished they had served me better beef and price could be increased if they had better quality of wagyu beef.
1
I went there with 5 friends. We order set meal and one beer to try. The food was pretty average and the portion were little. And we waited for at least 20 to 30 minutes for them to serve just a single dish. The price were ridiculously high compare to other restaurant
4
This is newly renovated location compared to previous venue in CHIJMES ! As usual, I order omakasei and have my sushi at sushi bar while observe the sushi is being prepared by the chef ! This is the place where I learn about Omakasei (where you let the chef select the best for you) ! I ordered a S$100++ one and the food is tasty and nice ! One of the best sushi I ever have outside Japan 
5
very friendly service , great food, a lot of choice, both in sushi and in teppanyaki. not cheap, but absolute value for money
2
Also everything about this place is pretty average. The chef (who was polite) does cook in front of you but had his back to us so we didn't get to watch anything except smoke coming from the other side of him. The service is generally fine, the food was just food. Very disappointed that over 7 different dishes I can't say more than that. They have a rule where if they need seats for a second sitting you get booted out at 8.30. We arrived at 7.30 and the maitre d was adamant that we try to eat fast. I won't be going back.
1
Totally disappointed with the service and quality of food at Tatsu this evening. The beef and garlic fried rice was tasteless, the salmon didn't look appetizing. To make the situation worst it was full house and there was only 2 Teppanyaki chefs cooking for 16 customers at the Teppanyaki counter seats. Including taking orders from customers seated at the sushi counter. They were speaking in Chinese loudly to each other coordinating who cooks what for which customer. It was obvious that they were simply rushing to cook the food! Build no rapport with the customers, no showmanship, zero professionalism and the food was tasteless. The 2 chefs cooked in "bulk" for the customers. For example: 2 customer from one group and 1 customer from other group ordered beef. They would cook the 3 sets of beef as one order and split it into 3 plates. Problem is there is no portion control! Some would get more some less! Come on! This is absolutely unacceptable! Feels like I am at a food court Teppanyaki counter! The wait staff even forgot to serve us our miso soup that I had to ask for it! I order a bottle of sake at the beginning but it never came and I didn't bother to remind the wait staff as I had already lost my appetite half way through the meal.We have had many enjoyable meals at Tatsu in the past and this has been my worst experience! This is supposed to be one of the better Teppanyaki restaurant in Singapore and it's obvious that they have taken on more than they could chew! Service zero,food quality zero! We would have been better off eating at a food court Teppanyaki serving better food! I could not wait to get out of this place and did I mention that our bill was S$350 for 3 persons without any alcohol. I would have paid much less to eat better food else where or pay a lot more and have a much better experience at Hide Yamamoto or Shima where I will get my money's worth of food and service ! This will be my last time dining at Tatsu Teppanyaki in CHIJMES! And I will no longer recommend this place to my friends. To the contrary I will tell those I know not to waste their money here! There are many other better Teppanyaki restaurants to go to.

We have been to this restaurant twice now and can definitely recommend it.It is relatively small and popular so best to arrive early or make a reservation.Sitting at the counter is a good option and the ambience is great..Service is friendly and efficient.Cold beer on tap is a plus.We mainly had sashimi together with 1 roll.The first visit the sashimi was fantastic, so much flavor & texture and very fresh.The 2nd visit not quite so good as the texture of some pieces was a little mushy but still overall very good. the rolls were great both times
5
As a monthly visitor to Singapore - i have to always visit Tatsu in Chimjes. I do admit - i got for the sushi rather than the Teppanyaki - so usually sit at the sushi seats. They are always very friendly and i have been there more than 10 times and never had a bad dish ... Yes its it is small (compared to before they renovated chimjes) and yes its a little pricey - but if its delicious then i don't mind paying the extra dollars
5
Flames fly in Tatsu. Obviously this type of high-octane dining isn’t going to be to everyone’s taste and it probably won’t win any Michelin stars, but it certainly has its loyal fans.The chefs and the servers will go to great lengths to make sure you are happy. Cooked at a high heat and with only a drizzle of oil, the lightly seasoned cod fish with sauce in foil was delicious. The portions are smallish, but adequate. The amazing Aburi Sushi which consists of 5 pieces seared sushi and 7 rolls is a popular item on the menu. Layers of flavour and texture woven together in a symphonic result. Jiro might dream of sushi, but I have spent every waking moments obsessing about the seared sushi I had here.What made me pleased to be here? Pretty well everything. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
5
We were a group of six for dinner.Each dish was much much appreciated. The restaurant does not only satisfy the most demanding expectations.It is also an unforgettable experience to watch Chef Tony making his magical teppenyaki.The staff went out of their way to meet our requests.Surely will come next year again.Thanks to every member of the restaurant for this unforgettable experience

Tatsu fares better at their Teppanyaki than their Sushi and Sashimi dishes. It's our first time here and we've tried to test as many types of Japanese dishes as possible. I would only give at most a 3.5 stars because the service and finesse of presentation is far from the likes of a 5star fine dining restaurant. To be fair, the staff provided friendly and good service. But to differentiate themselves to be in the league of 5 star restaurants, the presentation and final touches are missing. The food, especially the Teppanyaki is great too. Their sushi tasted great but the rice was not rather loose, which is not the standard of the finest sushi. I believe with guidance, they can excel. I hope they do.
4
Tatsu is a relatively small in Chijimes very short walk from the Raffles and Fairmont hotels.We decided to go to Tatsu instead of any of the others in that "food" complex simply because we were talking about tepanyaki food the day before.The food was very good and plentiful and the sashimi we tried fresh and well presented.The tenpsyiaki cook was also great and interacting with all around the hot plate.Also very attentive and friendly staff. We had a great time and we would go back again.It's not cheap but worth it as the quality of the food was very good
3
Despite a very good food quality and professional work of the teppanyaki chefs, the service was poor and frustrating. We asked for an advise on the sake and the waitress directly proposed the most expensive one of the list. Overall, we could feel that we had to rush our dinner and they were eager for us to leave. Last but not least: 15 S$ for a bottle of still water is likely overpriced.
3
Service was very good
Food was Ok
Chef has no idea how a Teppan Yaki service should be done.
No complaints but a bit disapointing
1
Overpriced and small portions. Service is unfriendly. There are much better places in SG for Japanese.
Attached is the picture of the 130$ menu salad.....
4
Very good sushi!!
Unlicky had no company, so ordered the 9 plate mix. Did not tried other sushis. Seated in front of the sushi chef who prepared the food looked even moor promising.
5
Very good sushi !!!! , we stumbled across this excellent place by accident only to find quality fresh tasty food served by polite friendly staff . Highly recommend & we will drop in again before leaving
4
My wife and I were wandering around Singapore looking for a place for lunch when we stumbled upon an enclave of Japanese restaurants on Victoria Street. We ending up going into Tatsu, primarily because their staff was more proactive in enticing us into the restaurant. The food was very good and so was the service. Not too many Asians were dining here; most of the guests seemed to be European or American. My only complaint was the prices $60 for two lunches including one beer is too much.
4
loved the food, loved the place, loved the service. it was really very good. not sure what all the complaints are about, but we really enjoyed our evening here. the only thing was we over ordered and were told we couldnt cancel a dish eventhough it wasnt yet cooked
4
As a visiting westerner I found this sushi restaurant (amongst a row of equally good looking other Japanese places admittedly) to offer an authentic, fast based, seat at the cooking alter sort of place that is hard to find in the UK. So I was very pleased. I had a range of dishes, a tea, a beer, a hot sake, and left feeling thoroughly pleased to have found it
1
Was looking for a change from Sakae teppanyaki which we love but uttering disappointed. We were served food that was double the price of Sakae but Not even as good. Only good point was the friendly Chef. Service staff were more interested to close up clearing condiments while we were eating 3 times!! I pay less at Sakae but get triple the quality. I do not recommend this place at all..
2
It's a mix feeling walking into this restaurant. The food and drink menu suggest that this is a premium Japanese Tepanyaki restaurant but the service staff suggest otherwise. Nonetheless, we took a leap of faith to continue the meal here. First the sitting arrangement, restaurant is particularly warm due to the cramp sitting arrangement around the hot plate area, with the Tepanyaki hot plate facing us and the fridge behind us. Layout is horrible and cause discomfort with smoke and heat from the hot plate baptizing you every time the chef cooks something. It feels like a food court setting. (Other premium tepanyaki place seems to have a deeper hot plate or better smoke vent)Secondly on the food, ingredients used are good and fresh. We have a mixture of sashimi, sushi and tepanyaki and they deliver what was promised. We ordered the Wagyu beef & lobster tepanyaki set and I can taste the fats of the Wagyu meat BUT not the aroma of the beef or sweetness of the lobster. The Chef, IMO are not trained to handle these ingredients loading them with heavy pepper sauce etc, AKA food court style. It would be decent to dine here if the price is around $30 a head. Do not waste money and time buying Wagyu and lobster here.

My friend and I were at an event at the National library and walked over to Chijmes to have a quick bite to eat. We wanted Japanese so we randomly picked Tatsu and we had a great meal. We shared 2 sushi rolls, seared/grilled beef fillet, stir fried bean sprouts and a few beers. The beef was cooked perfectly and was a generous portion for both of us. The total came to 120sgd which isn't that bad for Singapore. The chef was so friendly and cooked our beef differently for each of us. The manager was very attentive. He took our order quickly, checked on us a few times and filled our water glasses without asking. The staff came by a few times to see if we wanted another round of beers. This might sound like basic service but in Singapore you are often frantically trying to get a waiter's attention to place your order or get a new drink. My friend and I eat out a lot in Singapore and we were both really happy to discover Tatsu. What I loved about this place aside from the food was the fantastic friendly service from the staff and the manager. The chef even came over to say hi and introduce himself at the end. This restaurant is great for business travelers who are alone because you can eat at the sushi bar and the staff is so warm. Keep up the good work guys
5
A gem in the local F&B scene. Wonderful wait-staff & fine selection of ingredients. It was an unplanned visit that became lilfelong memory :))
1
Not up to a good level... Average food, poor service and bad performance...despite the efforts of the chef to make it up.
4
We went to try this restaurant because it was next to Westin Hotel where my family was staying. Food is good but portion is very small so the bill ended up quite expensive (but probably because we ordered wagyu beef, uni sashimi & foie gras ) The atmosphere is nice, there is a regular dining section & a Teppanyaki section. The service was excellent - we came quite late for dinner, so the waitress was very kind to offer some tamago (Japanese style cooked egg) for my 1.5yr old to eat before while he wait for his grill fish to come.
4
We popped in here rather off the cuff and was pleassntly surprised Good service attention throughout the evening and very good food and saki.The sashimi was fabulous as were tapanyaki dishes.Average prices for good japanese but not cheap.Overall very good and we will go bac
4
A nice place to stop for some sushi whilst exploring the colonial area. We've eaten here twice now and the sushi is definitely to be recommended. I particularly liked the seared salmon rolls, which had a lovely smokey taste. The staff are attentive but could perhaps be a little less keen to take your plates away!Combine this with a shopping trip to Raffles City Mall and drinks at the long Bar at Raffles Hote
4
Tatsu is in corridor of Japanese restaurants in the new refurbished Chijmes complex, which is a former nunnery. We dropped in on spec for lunch and sat at the sushi bar. It's quite small and has a fairly cosy atmosphere and I can imagine that it might be a bit cramped when busy. Reservations are probably recommended. Ordering drinks was fun, as the proprietor gave us small taster glasses of the Asahi Dry and the Asahi Black beers on tap and we ended up choosing a half and half blend which is highly recommended. The sushi was very good. In particular we liked the crispy salmon rolls - so much so that we ordered extra!Overall we had a very enjoyable lunch I shall certainly visit again
2
It was my gf birthday and i had just proposed to her earlier in the day so i decided to bring her to tatsu teppanyaki for an evening of fun.We ordered the tatsu set and the wagyu+lobster set (they served us the wagyu set though, we did nt check so its fine). The food in generally was v good, from the wagyu beef to the crayfish n prawns, they were of a high standard.However,the disappointment came from the performance, or lack thereof. I personally feel that an important element of a teppanyaki is the showboating performance. So, to sit at the counter n expose ourselves to the fumes n all, only to realize that the chefs are juz cooking the food without any performance is a letdown ( didnt even see a single flame)Will not revisit this place, shall try somewhere else for my next teppanyaki meal.
4
Expensive but worth it sums up this restaurant. It's quite small and was virtually full when we arrived - fortunately we had pre booked. The wine choice was limited but they served a very passable sauvignon blanc. The waiters were very helpful as we have had little experience with Japanese food and the chefs were entertaining and talented as we watched them cook our next course. The sushami was lovely to begin then we shared the wagyu dinner course and the seafood dinner course. Both had many ingredients and were full of exciting flavours. Had a very enjoyable evening
5
Tried this teppanyaki place recently and it was a hit. We were lucky to get two seats as the place was full (with an entertaining Bday party we later found out). The teppanyaki show was good but I have seen much better shows here in UAE, nevertheless we enjoyed it and found especially one of the chefs very talented, unfortunately we did not get his name. We shared a teppanyaki menu and some sushi and I personally was very delighted with the amount of garlic used for everything. Was super tasty. You can just ask them to use less, the chefs are very accommodating. A small minus was that they did not have any plum wine. Usually that belongs in a Japanese place, moreover it did not say on the menu that the salmon roll contained creme cheese which I'm allergic to. Overall, we would love to come back and have another dinner here
4
Tucked along the new corridor of Jap restaurants in Chjimes, is this cosy but stylish sushi cum teppanyaki restaurant. Limited seats so reservations are recommended. We were given the choice of sitting round the teppanyaki or sushi tables. There are about 15 seats around the teppanyaki. It was a pleasure to watch and smell our food being prepared. The garlic rice is superb with additional crisp garlic topping generously available on our individual plates. Chicken, cod, tenderloin (medium rare is best) were the best choices that we made. The unajyu + tempura maki and toro sashimi were particularly excellent. Service was attentive and helpful. Overall a memorable meal though somewhat pricey.
4
Awesome food and entertaining chefs. The restaurant is small and located in the Chijmes old heritage building where there are a number of enticing bars and restaurants. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy Japanese flavours.
1
Poor quality/price ratio:
*low attention to customers
*charge 5$ for a miso soup: this is ridiculous!
*slow service
1
I was really disappointed with Tatsu Sushi. I made a reservation but they did not secure place for us so we needed to wait. They push in chairs to let us squeeze in. We did not have comfortable space but at least we have a place to eat. This was very far from expectation with $50 Tokujo Sushi par person.Toward the end of dinner, we were asked to move to different table because they need to create room for other customers. Because we are finishing up, we ask staff to wait. We did not have good experience so far and we just want to spend reasonable time to finish our dinner. Did not want to rush.After we finished the dinner with a sense of rush, the customers waiting for table asked me apologize for not giving up table for them. I told her it was not my fault and I do not see any reason why I need to make apology to her.Tatsu Sushi should have made reasonable effort to make customers happy. I know they need to make money and want to accept as much reservation as possible. But they are doing it at the cost of customer experience
3
We had sushi as a starter and teppanyaki as main course (beef and fish). Sushi was good but the Chef used so much garlic with all three teppanyaki dishes that all we tasted was garlic. The show was ok - had better experiences befor
4
This is a small restaurant in the lovely Chijmes area. The choice of seating is in the Teppanyaki room or at the sushi bar. We enjoyed a top meal at the sushi bar where the chefs prepare each dish from scratch in front of you. The service was attentive and friendly. The wine choices were few but fine for this cuisine. The food was of top presentation and so delicious.Certainly recommend for authentic Japanese food very well done
5
We were teice in the tatsu, once forsushi and once for teppanyaki. The sushi was nice but not outstanding. Go for the teppanyaki!!! Delicious food (esp the beef and the prawns) and pure entertainment. We will definitely go back
3
Having experienced Teppanyaki and the accompaning show in many different cities, Tatsu turned out very good for me in some respects and just barely average in others. The cuts of beef and salmon and their preparations score high points. The show, although pleasant, was not up to par. Perhaps we had a quiet chef (or he didn't speak english), but would have liked some more interaction. The salad and miso soup were not acceptable for this sort of establishment. The decor is very dark and bland. Seating a bit uncomfortable and cramped. Service was decent. I probably would not return here again, but perhaps for Singapore this may still be the best option and value for Teppanyaki
5
Good sushi for a decent price! It's hard to find thick slices of sushi at a reasonable price in Singapore. Definitely will come back for more.
4
This is a smallish Teppanyaki restaurant (where you sit in one line) and quite pricey but we thoroughly enjoyed the food which was tasty and fresh. We chose salmon, prawns and steak as our main meals - all expertly cooked. We had a few special requests (no onions for one of our party) and they were very accommodating and made us very welcome. Good wine and beer selection - and great chefs who get their customers interacting. Busy and popular with the locals which has to be a good sign. We will definitely return next time we are next in Singapore
5
Googled for a teppanyaki restaurant and this one popped up. Thanks to the address and picture on Google it wasn't too hard to find. I opted for the Wagyu dinner set ("all in"). I asked for a replacement for the mushrooms which was one of the dishes, and I got some fresh fish instead. Excellent service. When I asked if they had some spicy sauce for ny fried rice the chef got some chili and "re-fried" the rest of the rice with some chilis and spices, spicing it up. Was great. He continued to add some chilis to the vegetables and also to the Wagyu marinade. The chef asked/recommended medium to raw and I concurred. And I did not regret. I could almost have eaten the beef with a straw. Excellent, almost kobe. A bit expensive, but it was worth it. Please be advised that the current location shuts down for upgrades on August 7th 2013, but they are opening up a new location.Highly recommended
4
Loved the lunch bentos - High quality and reasonable priced...
5
If you are in Singapore and looking for a historical venue to wine and dine, have sashimi at Tatsu and then hop to the Auld Alliance for whisky. It's the best experience.
4
The food was good, I don't eat seafood but it doesn't matter there are enough choices to satisfy. I tried goose livers for the first time and surprisingly they were very tasty, I watched the chef prepare them to cook and they were so hard he couldn't put the fork in, yet they were so tender they melted in your mouth.This place has a great atmosphere and the service is attentive. Give it a go and watch the chef carry on with all the cooking utensils and even trying to flick egg into diners mouths from the BBQ
4
Only a handful of fine-dining Teppanyaki restaurants in Singapore and having experienced Shima (Goodwood Park) and Keyaki (Pan-Pacific) before, we decided to try out Tatsu. It's a smaller setup but nice cosy atmosphere and equally good service. We had a young Malaysian chef who did quite well with his entertaining cooking skills. The food was fine in terms of freshness but the choices seemed ordinary and for that, we felt that there are still some gaps between fine-dining Teppanyaki in Singapore compared to our experiences in Japan and Hong Kong when prices are comparative

We went there as a family because our children love seeing the chef cook in front of you. My husband and I had the Wagu set which was absolutely incredible. Everything was really good but special mention needs the wagu beef which was the best meat I have had in my life. I finally understood what was special about it.It is true as other reviewers mention that the experience was pricey but in my opinion, definitely worth it

I was tossing up as to whether I rate Tatsu Sushi as Average or Very Good but opted for the latter due to the freshness & flavour of their food. Two things were swaying me towards an Average rating - firstly our Bill was considerably more than those of last year and secondly our waitress (who seemed to be in charge overall) offered us tastes of dishes we saw being prepared for a Japanese couple beside us which we thought was great, only to find them on our Bill when we came to pay! The food itself is really good. We had Sushi, Sashimi, Miso Soup (the Mushroom Miso a bit woody in flavour, the Clam Miso fabulous), Prawn & Vegetable Tempura and Chicken Teppanyaki & white wine. We ordered our wine by the glass ($S12 each) as we didn't think we would drink a bottle but we ended up having 2 glasses each and could have had a third - glasses were small and the contents well below standard - as we say in Australia "the tide was out". This is a Restaurant for couples or a group of 3 as you all sit at one long counter containing the stainless steel cooking plates and conversation can prove difficult with a larger group. As other Reviewers have said, it is pricey so just keep tabs on what you order and if having wine, order by the bottle

We really enjoyed being entertained by Chef David Ong, who cooked us some really lovely food and provided lots of entertainment for the kids. Overall, staff are attentive but not intrusively so, and the restaurant is nice and cosy. However, it is quite pricey (although not as bad as Shima at Goodwood Hotel), so do bring a fat wallet along with your appetite. We had starters and dinner sets for 4 plus drinks, and it came to about SGD$400. Worth it though

We came here for an evening meal and eschewed sushi in favour of teppanyaki - there's a wide range that Tatsu do, including teppanyaki and noodles too. Beware that some things are really rather pricey - a couple of bits of salmon were almost astronomically so - but it's fun to sit here for a while and watch the chefs showing off, tossing salt shakers through the air or chopping at prawns. It turns out it is acceptable for them to play with your food...Staff friendly and very attentive, but bear in mind that it's not at all spacious - probably room for 15 people at the bar, and that is it. So given both the budget and the price, not the best place to rock up at if you're toting an enormous backpack..

went there several times. very nice sashimi but be careful, bill can rise up to 200.- dollars if u dont watch ur order... (u can reach that easily by just ordering sushis Ã  la carte)i personally had feelings between "awesome" and "tourist ripoff". have seen many local wealthy japanese customers. if locals go there, for me always a sign that at least food quality cant be that bad....located at Chijmes which is for sure an expenisve tourist destination.very friendly chef who serves u extra "goodies" between courses and also explains details bout the food ingredients..

This restaurant offers good Japanese food from Sushi to Teppanyaki just around the corner from the Raffles Hotel. All classics from the Japanese cuisine are prepared freshly and taste really good. They also do have some Chochou on their menue. The service is very friendly and helpful if you do have any questions
