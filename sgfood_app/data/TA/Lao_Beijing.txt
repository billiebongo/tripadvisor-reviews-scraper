This is the 3rd times i have been there and i love the food so much. Will visit again if I am at that area.
4
Enjoyed lunch here with friends. Good food and service with nice ambience. Had half a Peking Duck which was yummy.
4
Overall experience is good.
Air-con is, however, a tag too cold for us despite we asked to sit away from the air-con vents.
4
The pan fried dumplings could have been better. But other than that the food was delicious. Loved the spicy toufu and eggplant!
3
Service average because not enough staff. Food ok for the price but taste wise so so. Will visit again if in Novena but will not specially go.
5
Love their Xiao Long baos. 10 for $10. Think the price got more reasonable. Their beef noodles were good too. $15 a bowl. Service has improved from the last time I went a few years back.
4
We had the beef noodles soup - spicy and non-spicy. The soup stock was full of flavour and the beef pieces tender.
5
This is the nth visit to lao Beijing. Got a discount through purchasing the voucher in advance. Food was nice and suitable for the elderly.
1
Visited a week before CNY and they changed the entire menu to Chinese New Year dishes (yu sheng, blah blah that I have no interest in). Expensive "festive" set menu mostly but none of the regular ala carte meals that I can look forward to. So unfair to impose their standards on diners. The reservation did not even mention the change of menu pre-CNY. I feel cheated. I am super disgusted with Lao Beijing. The restaurant itself is short-staffed and staff are inattentive, rushed, and very impersonal. What a horrible, terrible first experience with Lao Beijing. Superbly low standard by the Tung Lok chain
3
First time at this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. Quality of food was good, but I was disappointed that they provided a small table for 6 of us. Food were served so quickly that we had to tell the waiter to hold our order as we were almost stacking plates and forced to clear the food in a hurry.Despite having a handful of servers, it was difficult to catch their attention during peak periods.Overall I would still go back, though i hope for a better level of service next time round
3
food was good but a bit on the pricey side. service can be quite inconsistent though, was hard to get staff’s attention at times.
4
Have been visiting this restaurant for a while now and have always like the flavours of the food here and the hospitality of the staff.
5
Staff was friendly and the food quality is good. Definitely recommended. Must try a few of their specialty dishes.
4
The food that I ordered tasted nice for most but it is expensive. Service generally quite good. Restaurant looks ancient so looks quite good. I had one of the festive dinner there.
5
It was a pleasant experience with good food, good service and good atmosphere. I was there celebrating my grandmother's birthday.
4
The popiahspreadcame in an impressive tray containing all the ingredient for making a great popiah. The venison is great too. Dice chilli chicken is another dish to die for
5
Service waa good despite Friday dinner crowd. Didn't have to wait very long for the dishes. Family enjoyed the food very much
4
Good for sharing, if you’re feeling full. The beef noodle soup and fried shredded pork were both good.
3
Food was quite average. Service overall not bad. For those who like dumplings and Xiao Long Baos can consider trying.
5
We visited on Christmas Eve, pleasantly surprised to get a place on walk in. Absolutely superb service and great tasty food, even if a few menu items were not available on the night. We felt totally looked after by the staff and hope to return for another meal at this restaurant. Top desserts too
5
went to the Novena outlet several times and it never fails me. Yummy food, friendly and helpful good staff, good environment.
4
Had lunch with clients and they requested for Lao Beijing at Novena. Ambiance is great for business lunch. Set lunch is worth the money. Will definitely visit again!
5
We been here twice before, we like the food n service. Will go back again. Will also recommend friends.
4
Good Dian Xin. Hot plate Tofu was a hit. Can get quite busy esp on weekends so best book in advance. Overall good food and decent service.
4
We, 3 of us, order a few dishes, including pork rib, dumpling and vegetable. Portion is ok and taste is also not bad.
3
Suitable for families. A number of our favourites were no longer in the menu. 4 dishes (fried rice, dumplings, meat and veg) set us back by about $90.
4
A plesant nice dining cuisine that one family can enjoy a good dinner over there. Even though we had brought along our 7-month old baby, we felt safe that no accident could be happened. Decoration is well fit to have feelings of China Beijing style. Quality of food, can't say being the best, is one of the best. Altitude and manner of waitresses are alright. The Chinese chicken soup with ginseng is recommendable. Beijing duck is well served. Dumplings are of good quality. One may try the 'Red bean Pasted cake' after the main dishes as dessert
3
The service, ambience, and food are similar to low end dim sum resturant, nothing special. However it is the only Chinese resturant in a shopping mall specialised in sport goods, and its business is usually good. The taste and presentation of xiao long bao (steamed meat dumpling), veg and wonton are edible but below the standard of Din Tai Fung or Tim Ho Wan. However the price range is on par. There's additional cover charge for appetisers and tea. Over all S$25-30 per head. If I have a choice, this would not be my pick
5
This was our second visit here, the food was really tasty and though while not entirely Beijing food (actually many regions of China were represented!), there was something for everyone. My only very minor grouse is that sound absorption is quite low so the restaurant tends to be quite noisy
4
Very popular simple restaurant serving good old fashioned style hearty food Do try the homemade bean curd with spinach and mushrooms which is one of their signature dish The delicious hot plate venison is another must try. Their daily double boiled nourishing soup ,primarily chicken ginseng soup ,is good value and served piping hot. Warm you up instantly For noodles lovers go for the Zhe Jiang noodles although I found the sauce a taste too salty. So don't pour the whole bowl of bean sauce at one time Another must have is the hot soya bean drink without sugar. Can really taste the beans Finally end the enjoyable meal with the cold sour and sweet lemongrass jelly Service is warm and hospitable and food comes fairly quickly This is one restaurant you won't be disappointed and prices as reasonable The clientele is largely locals and regulars. This Speaks for itself on the quality of the food Always Come out satisfied
5
Great lunch set menu for 2 pax.
Delicious food and great service.
Food items were served quickly, which was great for lunchtime
4
We love the service at Lao Beijing, Velocity, Novena. Crispy Skin Roast Duck and Kung Pao Chicken are must haves.
Chef cooked Vegetarian Mapo Tofu and some other dishes for WiFI, we have had better, but at least my wife didn't go hungry.
Reasonably priced.
5
we have 7 or 8 dishes, and enjoyed all but one (not that that one was bad, just not to our taste). fish in claypot, spicy tofu claypot, crispy fish skin fried in salty egg - this one was aboslutely divine.
4
This place is good, having authentic chinese food, especially loving the ja jiang mian. I also love their popiah, totally recommended. It's suitable for big family dinner too. The interior is pretty interesting.
4
I went to the novena square outlet. Is good. I ordered the stir fried pork strips wrap with pan cake, some fried buns and vegetables. Crowded during weekend. Spacious and clean.
4
We tried the hi-tea on Sunday and the selection is not your usual SGP local favourites. Mainly dumplings, guo tie, etc. and noodles. They also serve their signature poh-piah as well. One thing i take my hats off to them is their service staff is extremely friendly and helpful despite a busy afternoon
4
The do-it-yourself poh piah is nice and makes for an interesting experience as you get to spread stewed turnip and assorted condiments on the poh piah skin, according to your preference, and roll it up yourself. You may make a mess, but it still tastes good. Other recommended dishes are the 3 cup chicken and stir fried beans. The stewed tofu topped with seaweed is good and the Chinese pancake filled with red bean paste and topped with sesame seeds is good too. If you have the Amex platinum card and order at least 2 main courses, one person dines for free but this does not apply to set meals
4
Family decided to have Winter Solstice dinner at Lao Beijing Velocity. Direct access from Novena MRT station.Clean oriental style restaurant with 3 private function rooms. Little noisy at main hall during peak hours. No wifi. Ordered $288++ tasting menu (7 course + 1 dessert). The food was just sufficient for 8 adults. Tasty and non greasy. Really tasty. Restaurant agreed to swop the dessert to dumpling in almound paste to suit the occasion "Winter Solstice". Thank you for the arrangements.Was really great. Everyone enjoyed
3
We always come here for the Beijing-style sweet and sour fish! Our kids are not really fans of fish just love this dish. There are also other dishes which are good like the crispy skin roast duck, special Zhajiang noodles and pan-fried onion pancake. It helps that Lao Beijing is under Amex's Loving Dining program and we enjoy a pretty good discount each visit!
4
Family bonding time.Tonight, visited Lao Beijing Restaurant (老北京食堂) located at Velocity @ Novena Square. Nearest MRT will be Novena station.Clean place. No WiFi. Friendly helpful waiters and waitresses. Decided on the $248++ set dinner menu for 8 persons. Nice food. Big portion of food, there were leftover. The double boiled chicken soup and seafood fried rice were tasty. My family always picked this restaurant for dinner, inclusive reunion dinner. Enjoyed
5
Extremely great food and service. A great place for lunch and dinner in groups. Booking in advance will be great to prevent long waiting time as it can get crowded at meal times
3
Ok food with ok prices. The dishes are average, nothing that great. However the Xia Long Pao are very nice. Still worth a visit for the Xia Long Pao.
4
We were here for lunch and manage to get a room. The setup is normal but provide sufficient privacy. One dish to try is their chili fish, taste refresh and not too spicy. Their braised pork trotters are nicely cook, soft but tender. They serve good yum paste for dessert too
1
Totally agree with other reviewers, service @ Lao Bei Jing sucks. Waiting staff are only keen in pushing tea, appetizers (chargerable but placed on your table without being ordered) and towels to customers.Tasteless food in small portion for the price charged.Requested for empty bowl, it takes forever to come. Such a place has the cheek to charge 10% service charge
1
Had a family dinner of total 8 pax. Very dissapointed to say that the service and food standards have dropped drastically over the years. 1. Service- Our meal was at about 8pm, when the restaurant was not very busy anymore. Despite this, the waiters only topped up the water on our table when prompted, and did not help to change our plates, which made it very difficult to roll the Peking roast duck. Very dissapointing, as the service used to be much better. 2. Peking Roast Duck- Usually the family favourite. We ordered a whole duck, but the plate which was served only had about 10 pieces of skin, and 10 more pieces of meat. We have ordered this dish many times before, and it was very clear the amount of duck skin was at most half a duck and not a whole duck. Furthermore, the skin was not crispy at all. Even after checking with the staff, they insisted that it was a whole duck. Suspiciously, they do no longer carve the duck skin in front of you. The rest of the dishes ordered (Fried rice, dumplings, vegetables etc) was only so-so. Will not come back any more for family dinners
4
Went there for lunch yesterday to celebrate my mother's birthday. 6 adults and 3 kids. Ordered 烤鱼, sweet & sour pork, salted egg prawn, Peking Duck, mutton and 小笼包. All the dishes are nice. The kids also enjoyed the food. Would try again if future. Btw, the 烤鱼 has both fish meat and vegetables, so no need to order a vegetable dish separately. The portion of fish is generous. The meat is tender and boneless, so also suitable for kids
1
Was there with relatives, what a total disappointment!!We ordered 4 dishes , first came the veg, we have to ask for rice before anyone served, then about 10mins, another dish up, followed by few more mins of wait for the 3 dish.. each time we asked for our last dish which was a fish, everytime staff will say coming soon.. all in all we waited for 30mins yet no fish!! Worse of all, no one bother to serve us water or even ask if we need tea!! No chilli serve too!Still dare to charge us 10% service charge which we refused to pay! We still pay for whatever served, a total of $84. NOT WORTH IT ST ALL!! It is not about the money, my mother is so pissed that this meals caused us total embassement infront of our relatives!!First time and definately last!! Lao Beijing, YOU SUCKs!I get better service and a super full meal at our neighborhood hawker centre!
4
We had been on a private tour of Singapore and, when asked what we would like for dinner, we said Chinese.Our guide took us to Lao Beijing at Novena Square Shopping Centre (and MRT station).Our meal was most pleasant and unhurried, and distinctly chinese
3
This Once-Famed Lao (old) Beijing cuisines and finger foods have almost lost its passion and tradition in its food culture in both its customer service, flavour and presentation. Though the egg fried rice is still perfect, the vegetarian dumplings and the deserts are total disappointments! Even the Canton HK Paradise in ARC or Emerald HK Resturants in GW City in GWCity offer better values for your money in all aspects 
3
Visited this place years ago, tried out again last weekendWe ordered few dishes for 3 person, I like to recommend the Spicy chicken (辣子鸡), when is quite special, taste is very good, and personally, I like to size of the chicken, which is bigger than the norm, crispy on outside and tender inside, not too spicy, is consider as one of the better dishes thereWas disappointed with the XO sauce dumpling, thought that was the specialty, didn't live up to my expectation.The bruised pork (红烧肉）also quite disappointing, not too bad, but I expecting more.Staffs are friendly and attentive, service is goodPretty crowded and seems like a good place to bring family including old folksOverall experience is quite good
4
Today celebrated my dad's birthday at Lai Beijinh in advance. Ordered 8 course dinner at $398++ for 8 persons.
Restaurant newly renovated. Helpful and friendly staff. Dinner was tasty.
My family enjoyed very much. It was another gathering and bonding session.
Happy. Enjoyed.
3
Ordered a few dishes, stew sea cucumber, sweet and sour pork, hotplate tofu. The best dish was the crispy skin roast duck. Service was so-so as they served us dishes which we didn't ordered.
3
Went for a simple lunch on a weekend. Easy to get a table for two. Service was decent.
The Beijing-style special zhajiang noodles was quite good, but the pan-fried dumpling bun was a disappointment.
3
I was a dumpling-restaurant crawl when I came across Lao Beijng. Nice looking decor and reasonably friendly staff. The food was ok. Nothing spectacular. Not as good as Din Tai Fung.
3
I have tried a few branches of restaurants under Tung Lok Group except Lao Beijing. When I stepped into this restaurant at Velocity where its nearest MRT station is Novena. Nothing has attracted me. Just like to walk in normal inn to me. We had ordered DIY popiah that was recommended by friends. I dun think it is that fantastic, just a normal dish that you gonna to wrap your own popiah. No prawns, the popiah turn cold easily. We had a steamed fish, the waitress was honest to show her opinion that it is nicer to steam than to deep fry. We like her recommendation. We also had their new dessert from the menu. It was made by mullets who claimed to be special but yet a bit of disappointing. We had red bean pancake too.
5
Best Xiao long bao I've ever eatenThe skin is thin with tender meat and very juicy. The juice can even fly out if you are not careful. Better than those I eaten elsewhere.Been there for the last eight years and still my first choice for xiao long bo
4
I have always enjoyed the Chinese food at Lao Beijing as they always maintain a certain standard over the years. I like their Xiao Long Bao and noodles dishes very much as they are well prepared and tasty.My family likes dining here too as it is spacious and has a very pleasant ambient. The place is very suitable for big groups or gatherings. During my visit, I tried a new dish called steam seabass with ginger sauce. The seabass is very fresh and the ginger sauce made this dish very refreshing.
4
I have just finished dinner at Lao Beijing Novena. There were five of us and we shared many lovely dishes such as zhar jiang mian , fried dumplings, crispy pork wraps,xiao long bao,Peking duck wraps and black pepper beef. Great night with friends & can recommend to others
4
Plenty of Chinese specialties, well served and delicious, what should I ask for more? Service is good and food is delicious, I will definitively come back ! With Amex you could have a 50% discount, even better ! (not sure if it is an all year long promotion though). The only minor point it is that the location is in mall (like everything in Singapore !). Therefore the atmosphere remains noisy and more like a food court rather than a restaurant
5
Went with some friends and had both steamed dumplings as well as fried ones (pot stickers), amongst other dishes. Dishes were good as well as good value for money. Worked out to be about 26sgd per head. Atmosphere is convivial and service is pretty good. Will go back.
4
One of the best xiao long bao in town. Fast service. Noisy ambiance but that's expected for this kind of eating establishment.
Try to book in advance as it can get very crowded and long waiting list especially weekends.
Will surely return for more :)
4
Has been going to Lao Beijing for a number of years. Find it affordable even if I go there alone. Good quality food. Service level is consistent. A
good place to have a nice simple and quiet meal. I don't mind eating there alone.
4
We ate in a room separate from the main resturant- Nice food- good service, clean, so handy if your staying at hotel oasia..
4
Good is good and value for money. Tried their signature sping roll (they serve the condiments and you have to make your own spring roll) - the seniors who were with us gave this dish the thumbs up, SGD22 gest you 6 spring rolls.
3
I chose the Lao Beijing as my guests from overseas were fans of Chinese food. The staff were courteous and patient as we made our orders. Food was promptly served and the portions were generous. However the food quality and taste were just average. The ambience was typical of a Chinese restaurant. The restaurant was very crowded and hence, a high noise level. We were lucky we got a table at a corner of the room.All in all, the restaurant was average in terms of ambience and food, but service was commendable
3
After a few days of eating "fast food" style meals in Singapore, finally tried out Lao Beijing for lunch as this was the only restaurant near our hotel that served Chinese food similar to what can be eaten in Shanghai or Hong Kong. The Xiao Long Bao was good, and so was the Chairman Mao pork dish. Other than that, the other dishes were on the bland or oily side. Nothing really great about the place (compared to HK or Shanghai restaurants) but if you are desperate for Chinese food, this will pass.By the way, even glass of water will be charged to your bill
4
We had two meals at different Lao Beijings. The first at Novena the other, lot better at a shopping mall to the west, no idea where it was. The first meal was OK, except for a rogue spice that brought tears to my companion's eyes. The second with a group of Singaporeans was a fantastic buffet
3
It was a Thursday night that we went to Lao Beijing for dinner. The place was 95% full by the time we reached there around 7.30-8pm. There were a few things that we wanted to try from the menu but we ended up with a chicken mushroom ramen (dry), crab meat siao long pao and stir fry seasonal vege. All the dishes were not overly salty and the noodle tasted quite nice. We didn't really enjoy the crab meat xiao long pao as we didn't find it was outstanding. But overall the dining experience was quite nice
5
Dined with family and relatives - food was really excellent, the Buddha jumps over the Wall really good and felt totally re-energised after the meal. Cons : tables are crammed together, we were sitting back to back with diners from the next table..As with most Chinese restaurants it was quite noisy though the very high ceiling helped to muffle the raised voices. Another minus point is the rushed service : before we could finish one dish, another came swiftly...in the end, we ended with four large dishes of food, and the remains of an earlier item transferred to a smaller plate, to fit the lazy susan.But despite all the minus points, I would still go back to Lao Beijing for another meal
3
I hadn't eaten here for several years but my son decided he wanted the xiao long bao (steamed juicy meat buns). Ordered chrysanthemum tea and was pleasantly surprised that it was naturally sweetened using dried red dates and also had some herbs in it - think it was the most refreshing tea I've had for quite a while.Overall, good food though not fairly pricey, so-so ambience and the decor looked like it needed some sprucing up
3
Not spectacular, but affordable
4
great pork ribs and soup filled dumplings
3
so-so. Got value for $$ tea buffet
5
I can't praise this place enough. Every dish they serve seems fresh-made and not too salty nor too blend. Their selection is great and I just love all their noodles, dumplings and veges. Great buffet, great ala carte. Thumbs up.

Price - ** (once a year kind of thing or unless you earn S$5k/mth and above)

I only love their starter, si chuan vege
3
they seem to have a problem getting the orders right when the restaurant is busy.
3
haha.. i tink it is jus average..
3
It has a pleasure and casual atmosphere. There is a fatty pork dish which is delicious, think it's from chairman Mao's hometown. Try it.
3
Lao Beijing for some reason just never impressed me with their food as much as it has impressed the locals but I will say they have a very refreshing lemongrass dessert that is worth trying. Otherwise, not really my choice for my last meal in Singapore
