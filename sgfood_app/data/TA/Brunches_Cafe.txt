Close to Farrer Park mrt. Food was great, food and drink will set you <$30 per pax. Staffs were friendly üëçüèª

Service was generally good except that staff can give the customers time to finish meal instead of asking if they can clear plates immediately.
5
I had the set lunch options for 17.90 ++ Value for money.
Walked out super full and satisfied.
Would definitely come back.

Been at brunches cafe a few times to have my meals already. The service and standard of food has been consistently very good.
Oh yes, if you're there, do try their freshly baked bread, its uniquely good.
5
Service staff was really sweet, she allowed me to sit at an empty table though I was half an hour ahead of my reservation time, and reserved a nice corner for us. The pan fried salmon was awesome too!
5
Had late lunch here on a Saturday. 1)Mushroom soup was good with fresh mushrooms used. 2)Club sandwich was value for money though more BBQ sauce could be used3)Pimp my brekkie was ok, not mindblowing. Overall ambience is cool with friendly service staff. Prices are pretty standard though the club sandwich is a steal!
5
Their speedy and joyous service caught me off guard. Seldom do you get such service nowadays. They serve good coffee and are very generous with their portion. Their braised pork belly is very tasty, but needs more prep time to achieve the melt in your mouth kind of tenderness. Very cosy cafe and full house at lunch time on weekends. Good to reserve a seat so as not to be disa

Great place for hanging out with family, friends or even dining alone.
Easily accessible via Northeast Line (Farrer Park Exit B).

Vintage cafe with great service! The eggs benny could be more runny though. Love the decoration and service from the staff. Very attentive

We found this place while searching for brunch spots near our hotel. It was quite nice! The food, service and ambiance were all excellent. No complaints üòÄ.

Good food and ambiance as always. The good service is always a plus point. I always love how the place is decorated according to festive. Thank you staff of brunches cafe!

This is a nice little cafe near little India. The service staff is very friendly and they offer a selection of mainly western food.
We had breakfast there and the food was ok and the coffee was good.

Retro themed cafe. Reasonably priced good food and all day breakfast. Love the cranberries chicken steak!
5
Extremely impressed with the food and design of this place. And what surprised me most was the service provided! Everyone was very prompt and friendly! Truly service from the heart. I'll definitely recommend brunches cafe to my friends!
5
Prefect place for brunch especially for big group, service was great! The cafe is extensively decorated with vintage items and the ambience is good.
4
Food was good, esp the ice coffee. Cafe is packed with great vintage atmosphere! cafe sell vintage goods that are on display too.

Went on a Saturday night for dinner at 8pm and it was not crowded at all. Nice deco. Food is nice but not fantastic. Price is reasonable for casual dining. S$50+ for 2 main courses and a drink. We didn't manage to try the desserts and waffles which I think it's a waste cos they should be nice. I think it's a great place for couples and friends. Nice place for coffee and chatting. Friendly staff. Service is good
4
Cafe was located near Farrer Park station, very accessible. Food portion was huge and decent. Great service!!
5
I always enjoyed my time at Brunches cafe and highly recommended for friends/family gathering with good atmosphere, yummy food and good service!
5
Nice food, especially French toast, which is crispy and sweet. The food proportion is good enough for two persons sharing
5
The cafe is nicely decor with lots of my childhood memories items . Staff is very friendly and caring too.
4
I enjoyed all the 3 main dishes and coffee we ordered. Just that the restaurant fully utilizes every corner and space they have so i didn't really feel so comfortable while having meal. Staff were prompt and friendly too.
4
We had the cakes which was quite yummy. We had the lychee cake that was on par with Maison Ikkoku's standard. The rainbow crepe was really special and delicious. Worth a visit for their all day breakfast!
5
This place rocks. The atmosphere is good and the service is incredible. The staff literally never stop and are attentive to whatever you need. The Eggs Benedict are decent and the variety of tea is incredible.
Reasonably priced!

I ordered their club sandwich. Even if it had a thick slab of chicken in it, it was tasteless and somehow it defeated the purpose of being a club sandwich. I didn't like it at all.
5
I was here for vegetarian pizza and it was very delicious. The entire place is full of old school stuffs such as earrings, wall display of poster, plates n cups. Some of the seats are made from vintage car. It's a very interesting cafe to be at. Price is also very reasonable.

This was a real surprise in Farrer Park. The decor is very eclectic and quirky in all the right ways. When we walked through the door the first thing I noticed was a couple sitting at a table inside an open top car. The boot (trunk for our American friends) was open and presented a variety of condiments to go with your meal. Mixed chairs and tables with lots of memorabilia on the walls (all for sale) presented a wonderful atmosphere. Now of course your don't go to a cafe just for the decor but for the food. The staff were wonderful, attentive and friendly. The food was excellent and so was the coffee. Spanish omelette came with saut√É¬©ed mushrooms, grilled tomato and sourdough toast all fresh and tasty. At one point one of the staff came around and offered us samples of their fruit and cinnamon loaves to try....delicious and made on the premises. Good prices

Brunches caf√© is a good place to grab a good morning breakfast. They have a good menu, The staff is quick and efficient. The coffee and food was amazing as well.
5
Saw this cafe being recommended and decided to give it a go. Easy to find, with tasty food and relaxing atmosphere. Definitely worth the visit, though it is more on the pricy side.
5
Great cafe, attentive staff. Closed on Tuesdays, reasonably priced. Deff worth a visit, vegetarian options available
4
The cafe is within walking distant from Farrer Park MRT station and easily located. its environment is cosy, neat and clean. Food was fantastic, and well cooked.
4
Vintage style restaurant with antique collections. Good service and yummy dishes. Suitable for leisure time eat out.
5
If you want a large breakfast, eggs cooked as you like them with toast, sausage, bacon, mushrooms etc As well as usual Singapore options this is it. Coffee is top notch.
5
Drove pass this cafe a few times and kept saying we need to check it out. Lo and behold, Number two son Davyd, decided on tea there to celebrate mother's day.Walked in and the first thing that hits you is a nice homely setting with memorabilia on shelves all around the cafe... for me, a babyboomer, it brought back lots of fond memories.The menu is pretty extensive.. with pasta, meats all day brekkies, pancakes, waffles coffee and teas.. and my favourite truffle fries, Yums.. one of the best i've had.Service was really good... friendly and attentive.Our meal was good too...definitely warrants plenty more visits.If you're ever in the area.. its a must to pop in.

Stopped by Brunches for a ice coffee before my appointment . Nice and cozy , sat on the Mini Cooper couch which was a unique and comfortable experience. This quaint cafe tucked away on Rangoon road is a nice place to chill , did not try the menu today , perhaps on my return visit in the future

We went there for brunch after reading such good reviews. I don't know if it has recently changed hands or they have someone new in the kitchen, but very disappointed. My husband had the 'Pimp my Breakfast' and everything was pre-made, except for the poached eggs and it was cold!!!! It was like having left overs from the fridge for breakfast - cold sausage, bacon, potatoes and mushrooms. The eggs were very watery. I had the Spanish omelette which was good, but I did change the filling, so maybe they had to cook it fresh. The coffee was great though
4
Want to be seen cozing up in a MINI(a real mini car) booth and having your meals? This is the place to be at. Love the lamb burger and the various egg dishes. Every trip we make has a new surprise. The cafe introduced their new bread and it was really good. Last year just before Christmas they had a small group singing carols. With the many new cafes popping up almost quarterly here they should look to experiment and introduce new dishes to the menu. Overall a happy customer
5
The service is really friendly.
Ate yesterday here as well!!
The food is sublime.
Ordered.- truffle fries.. Frutti de Mare and
Creamy Egg Frittata.
And a cafe Latte.
$51 (singapore dollars).

Stumble onto this quaint little cafe on Sunday night. Food was pretty good, order their deep fried risotto ball with stew beef, very reasonable price for their coffee and tea selection. Very good cake as well, soft and moist!! All the antique are for sales!! Definitely will be back and note that they are closed on Tuesday (as a matter of fact, I wanted to have breakfast this morning and realise that they are closed today)
5
This is my 2nd time visiting Brunches Cafe... Both experience was beautiful! It was a great combination of cakes with tea or coffee. Staffs are approachable and able to recommend delicious pastries set for you. If you do not know what to have, just wait.. They will share with you! =
4
The cafe is really nice and the staff are very helpful. It's nice to be greeted with a smile on a Sunday morning.The food is nice and the portion is quite big. The coffee was great. Just nice that we are being seated at the mini converted dinning corner. It's really interesting to dine in car

Gina & Irene are the loveliest owners and Gina is majorly hands-on with taste & quality & being right at the cashier counter as often as I've been there. I go at least twice a month and at times weekly to do my computer work, to have a snack before or after my swim ...my swimming club is round the corner.MUST TRYS: TRUFFLE FRIES ...i used to think these fries are simply over rated over talked about & just oil to potato... But at BRUNCHES it is really the best I've tried so far. COFFEE: my husband who thinks he makes the best machined coffee has relented & said their coffee "got standard".My fave is their PICCOLO as that's just about the size I can manage - i often waste even the best coffee because a cup is just too much for me and an espresso is usually to bitter & a cuppacino is still too much although i love the foam. SO AT BRUNCHES they know exactly how i like my size, my strength, my milk amount and they serve it with the best tiny cookie homemade. At first i felt they were stingy with it but now they know me well enough i get 3 tiny cookies with my tiny coffee. Perfect pairing. So much to say about them. but their speciality mains is pasta which is simply with a slight twist. I would't say its the best pasta in town but the atmosphere the vintage ambiance just makes it all taste so good. PEOPLE often say a place is vintage but Brunches has real memorabilia from the era of betty boop (i have no clue why i use this analogy - its just that feel). I held my 3 daughters graduation dinner there and Gina was so so accommodating & reasonable about the menu, the pricing & allowing us to make the half area of her cafe our own. Please just go because it's worth a visit at least 4 or 5 times in your life:)

It took me quite some time to pen down these thoughts. I would like to compliment the owner and staffs for the welcome for our event on Brunches cafe. And I believe that Brunches cafe will succeed and have succeeded in doing good food and good service for all 50 of us guests. I must say we will come again to this cosy and welcoming place! :

Went for brunch but ended up having lunch instead.The set lunch was very reasonable & taste good. It was interesting to drink soup out of a cup but that added to the novelty of the place that includes dining out of a car booth. It is worth just coming to this cafe to look at its set-up though the food is a draw too. so am surprised that it was quite empty when I was there

We visited on a Sunday for brunch with our young children. The moment we entered the cafe, we were captivated by the interior. A mini was converted into a cozy dinning corner. Quaint and interesting deco filled the cafe tastefully.The food was delicious. We love the Brunches High Tea set which is presented in a lovely bird cage. My children went quite ballistic with the Golden Rissotto Balls. The Eggs Benedict was slightly too runny for my liking, but my hubby had no complaints about it.The wait staff were attentive and polite. The experience was made more special when a waitress gave us a glass filled with heart shaped cookies and wishing us happy Valentines' Day when we billed.Overall, it's a place suitable for couples, friends and even family with young kids

This quaint little cafe is an eye opener. At one glance, your eyes are wondering everywhere trying to drink up as many lovely pieces as possible. From the Mini Cooper booth seats, to the converted oil drums booth to the beautiful bid house light clusters suspended over one long table. Oh, and some of the items are for sale - from the bird house lights to whatever is not nailed down. Not too sure about the Mini Cooper booth - perhaps if the price is right!My girlfriends and I were there for lunch, and they served a very good macha latte. However, food wised, there is room for improvement. The beef burger could do with better patties - it tasted a tad dry and of processed meat. I wished the truffle fries that comes with the burger and we topped up an extra $2 for were chunkier too. I had the spicy duck aglio olio pasta which was just moderate. But then again, I will definitely come back because of its wonderful ambience with vintage knick knacks and the macha latte...

A vintage environment where it is good place for gathering if you want somethinb different. Location is great as it near to MRT. You can have a lot of photo at every corner. If you like photo, I guess you will be very happy. The special seat with the vintage car is a plus if you can get that.Food - average. I had egg Benedicts. It comes with big portobello mushroom and toast. It is a bit oily overall, not sure is it that day they have this issue. The toast doesn't really match the dish, I guess is personal preference. I never have the desserts so not sure how it taste.Drink - standard and taste fine
