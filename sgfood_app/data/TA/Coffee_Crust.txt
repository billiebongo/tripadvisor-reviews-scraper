We stopped off for a break from the marathon shopping day and though the location inside the hotel did not appear that great the coffee and pastries were of the highest standard. Very good indeed.

I only got myself a few cakes and coffee. Coffee was served hot and it tasted above expectations. The pastries are so so, not so extravagant or over the top.

I have gone there two times and the place is quiet nice place for a chat. Their cakes and coffee is good too.

We visited this place in the evening and were pleased with the offering. Delicate pastries, cookies and a good selection of coffee.
Its expensive by normal standards but worth every penny.
Will definitely recommend this place for any Choco lover. You wont be disappointed.

This is the place to start your day in Singapore, especially if you are visiting on a business trip. Quite crowded in the morning hours between 0700 and 0830, but it is definetely worth it ! Great breakfast dishes from all over the world, freshly prepared. This will get you started for a successful day in Singapore

The food is ok, they have a good selection of pastries. Don't expect much from the coffee - it is from automatic machines and for an Australian coffee-snob like me it really didn't satisfy.The staff were pleasant enough, and the place is bustling like a a quiet yum-cha place, if you get my meaning.I found it interesting to watch some very slightly built folks put away enough food to feed themselves for an entire week. Surely the best part of an all-you-can-eat buffet experience
