prides itself as a good beerhouse but the beers we had lacked depth, even though they are the same beers we had at other beerhouses. expensive as well.

Ordered the caramelised onion burger - the onions really are tasty! sweet and soft, they really made the burger more exciting. However, the servers missed out one of my friend’s main courses so service could be improved.
4
Standard of the dishes were OK and nothing stood out in particular. Perhaps the menu was too wide. Nice place to chill.
3
Was there for lunch, we had a recruit bowl which was decent however the avocado burger was on the salty side as such only managed half a burger.
1
Rude and non existent service. Decided to spend my money elsewhere. Waste of time. Rather go to Timbre.
3
Food is average, price is acceptable, ambience is decent, location aren’t that bad too. Staff service is definitely awesome!
5
Lunch sets ranging from $9 and up which includes a soup and salad. Definitely a steal! If you happen to have a friend working in South Beach Tower, just show the building card and you'll get 10% off the bill too!

I wasn't feeling the most hungry to go for the steak buffet, but had a 250g ribeye nonetheless. It was cooked well, and the sides (fries and salad) helped to complete the dish very well. The fish and chips were also alright, but I found the batter a little salty. Otherwise, the service was prompt, and ambience perfect for chilling the night away

Please save your time, money and tastebuds and dont bother with this joint. Booked this for my husbands birthday as he loves a good burger. Well... in the end we didnt even get the burger (they forgot that part of the order) so cant comment on what it was like. Can say the service was SHOCKING, wait staff had no knowledge of the menu or process (every question was met with a blank stare and 'ill have to check'), there wasnt a smile to rub between them and they wanted to spend as little time a humanly possible engaging with the patrons. The food we did have (starters) was slow in coming, over cooked, tasteless and greasy. Such a shame as it was my husbands birthday meal. Please save your time and dont bother with this place

It was our first visit. Cozy interiors and I can imagine sitting outside if the weather is good on a balmy evening. We ordered lunch sets of burgers and Japanese rice. The burger was delicious and it was a little small. But the generous portion of fries made up for it. The unagi don and beef don were a bit of a letdown. But the miso soup and vegetable salad that came with the lunch set was good. As its name suggests, it's definitely a place to go for beers and drinks after work or a good place to hang out with friends. There was only one wait staff and quite a few in the kitchen. so the service was a little slow. But he was really friendly and nice, and we didn't mind the wait for our dishes. Go check out the place, have a drink without too much expectation, and I'm sure you will have a pleasant time
5
Staff were friendly and helpful, food was good. Loved the armoury burger and the chilli crab pasta!! 5star for the chill atmosphere, nice place to unwind and relax
5
Live music - check!
Great range of beers, wines and spirits - check!
Delicious burgers and large portions of fries - check!
Will I visit again? Check!

nice atmosphere but the service was quite hard to get help. nice food and nice place to chill out though hard to find
1
Wanted to chill at this bar on a Saturday night. We were standing at the entrance waiting for a server to guide us to our table but nobody came after we stood there for 10mins so we entered ourselves and sat at a table. We wanted a menu to order but nobody came to assist us. Looked around and eye contacted with the server but he completely ignored us!! Couldn't take the bad service so me and my friends just left. Extremely horrendous service, I advise those who's thinking of patronizing them to give this a miss. Absolutely horrid service!!
3
The staff was friendly but didn't seem too clear as to what to do... eg. After we sat down, it took quite a while for the menu to come. We had to help ourselves to the utensils and plates. Food was decent, although I have to say we came for the Steak Buffet and it was actually the chicken that stole the day. Nice atmosphere though, not too crowded
3
Our food was great, though expensive. Same goes for the beer. But the atmosphere is good, so of course I'm willing to pay slightly more. However, one of our servers was a complete jerk. Didn't acknowledge us when we were waiting for our table, ignored us when we tried to get his attention, and didn't say a word when dropping the food and beer. It was another server's first day on the job and she was 100x better than the other guy
1
All I can say is don’t bother - I wont waste time trying to review this bar. Simply hopeless … ok ok le the give you a flavour. A round of drinks took 30+ minutes to arraive and even then it was wrong. Took matters into my own hands and went to bar and ordered a bottle of wine but there were no glasses so the waiter simply went scouting around table soft a while to locate some, clean them in front of me … That took 20 minutes or so. You pay 5 star prices for sheer incompetence!Do ask me about the food

LocationIt is at the South Beach. New area around Nicholl high way and Beach Road.PlaceIt is within a historical building. Interiors were nicely done with live music. But interior doesn't match the whole set up.Service Don't expect too much service. Run by young group of people. Very casual.FoodSo-so. Nothing fantastic. Price is just a little high for the quality of food.Overall, a place for younger generation to hang out. Nothing memorable about this place. Definitely not for family with kids
3
The Armoury serves a good burger, the craft beer selection is pretty good, the location is great and the place itself is vibey and lively. But the servers, while friendly enough, are lackadaisical, and they don't seem to understand their job. I would happily have drunk twice as many beers in the time I was there, except I couldn't get anyone's attention to come and refill my blatantly empty glass ... and this is a *craft beer* place
2
The title pretty much sums it up.Went there for the buffet which includes 1 bar platter to share and free flow of mains.From what i remember, the our platter included 2 cream of broccoli soups (which were pretty good), beef cubes (over done), corn and broccoli, pasta, buffalo mid wings, crispy drumlets, mini pieces battered fish and lots of fries.The platter was decent, nothing really fantastic.For the mains, we only ordered the rib eye, though there was also an option of battered fish or fried chicken thigh. The steak was tender and quite juicy and done to the correct doneness. The sauce was a little disappointing though.The buffet also included free flow coke but lemon tea was provided instead (overly sweet). They have quite an extensive drinks menu so you should be able to find something that suits your taste.All in all, it would have been a pleasant experience if not for the super slow service. The 2 or 3 people serving tables were clearly struggling to handle the crowd. Requests for service were met with multiple "i'll get back to you" or equivalent. We had to ask for the bill twice. And when it did come, the initial bill was fine, but when my card was returned to me, it was accompanied with the correct credit card charge slip but the wrong receipt. They weren't the most approachable looking service crew as well. Sorry man
3
The food there was average but the craft beer was nice. Nice place to chill for dinner and away from the crowd.
4
Very good value steak buffet at the weekend. Also interesting selection of beers. Well worth a visit.
5
Food was great, beer was good and service was wonderful. We had our three year old with us and the chef was more than accommodating and made some noodles for her. Really enjoyed ourselves Signature burger was spot on.
2
Looks nice. Selection of Beers ok but some of the 15 or so where out at 8:00pm Saturday night. The Mix Buffet is dreadful and a rip off! The Chicken Wings were good though.
5
Nice hangout place for relaxed drinks after work for the craft beer cravers. Craft selection could be better, but they had our favourite brews so it's good. Bar food was good, especially the Tenderloin. Would come back again. Located in the new happening F&B arena South Bridge Avenue

The interior of the restaurant is cosy. we had pretty high expectations until the waiter served us. there were no service manners throughout the course of our lunch experience.the waiters looked like they did not know what they were doing. they stood around most of the time while tables were waiting to be cleared. when asked why there was no asparagus in the salmon that one of us ordered, the waiter nonchalantly answered: 'oh sometimes the cook anyhow change the menu we also don't know lah. there is no asparagus so they gave you more broccoli.' (which was only 3 pieces, by the way.) the value of that salmon dish was priced at $23. to be fair, it tasted alright.2) the HOT Nutella Latte that was ordered is simply nutella and coffee, priced at $6. the first cup served was cold. when asked, the same waiter replied: 'oh did you order hot?' subsequently, the replaced cup was much better.for a mid ranged price restaurant/cafe, i think one would expect a more proper service and value for price

Dropped by for a late dinner on a Friday...we were fortunate to get the last table. The bar/restaurant was packed but not over crowded. The ambience was cozy. The owner's personal interests influenced the ambience and there were interesting pieces and takes reflected in the decor. Although I thought the place could do with a little spruce-up, the evening went by without that thought bothering me too many times. The staff/crew are young and energetic. Pleasant and very friendly, do not expect sober faces in "restaurant attire". Service is adequate with a few individuals obviously more experienced than others. Do not expect 5-star service-leave that to the Hotels. Our dinner consisted of The Armoury Burger, Rack of Lamb and Pork Ribs.The food was very satisfying and we really did not have anything to complain about....which is quite surprising because my husband and I are in the hospitality industry. Loved the burger, loved the rack of lamb, loved the ribs and even loved the fries. The meat was cooked exactly to how we preferred them. An inquisitive chat with one of the service crew revealed that a new Chef is in charge and since he has not disappointed guests ever since he came on board. Try their craft beers. Ask the staff to recommend. We will return,if anything just for the food and a place to chillax. Our dinner was slightly above SGD100 for the 3 of us. We were served by a smiley and very friendly staff. He was quick and very likeable - ask for Matthew

Chance upon The Armoury while on a walk with my wife on Beach Road. Was telling her about the old People's Defence Force (PDF) building. Saw this Bar/Cafe.. since it was dinner time..we walked in.The wait crew Matt, recommended the armoury burger for me and the rack of Lamb for my wife.While we waited, affable wait crew Matt entertained us with the story of how this Armoury started.Wasnt too long before the food arrived... wow... one of the best burgers i have ever had. The rack of lamb was excellent too according my wife.Food and service was excellent.We'll be back.

Visited the place, because of the value for money buffet. Frankly, it is sad that it was rather underwhelming. The steak was okay for the price, my only grouse was the one who prepared the steak did it too raw for medium, or medium rare that I could not chew into it. and despite ordering twice, they could not get it right. Even the medium well which I asked for later on, was alright but still not exactly how I would want it to be and I had to call for well done which sadly was a waste of a slab of steak. The service was sometimes quirky but still alright. It was pleasant of one of the staff to notice that something was wrong as we did not finish the steak. I do appreciate her observant gesture.I hope that I would go back there as the place is nice to chill out and I hope that the buffet will be good should I try it again next time.
2
I was with 2 other colleagues at the door, waiting to be seated. None of the servers who were there attended to us. it was only after multiple tries of getting their attention, did they finally attend to us. I also asked for water, but the servers took so long that I went to help myself. There were 3 servers present that afternoon, attending to 4 tables of guests. I don't think that's too difficult to manage ? they were not understaffed, so why was service so slow ? Will probably nor return, food wasn't fantastic either. had the sirloin bowl with soba. sirloin was tough and over seasoned.
5
Enjoyed myself. So did my buddies.
The beef was great.
House pour red was value for money.
The staff was attentive n friendly.
3
cannot reach restaurant via phone so we didn't know that they only serve steak buffet on weekend. One of us is non steak eater.
3
The ambience was quite chill and waiters were very friendly and helpful. However the steak buffet was not exactly up to standard as food was presented room temperature or cold at times everytime an order was made. The wagyu patty was amazing though.

Visited The Armoury on a Friday evening with a huge group of friends. Heard that they served a great variety of craft beers and very good food, especially the burgers. The huge group of us ordered a burger, loads of finger food like fish fingers, calamari, pizza, wings, fries etc. The portion is relatively small, each portion is only good for up to 4 pax. Yet, the waiter making the order did not remind us. (Ended up we have to order a few more rounds....). And the staff left after our food order and didn't wait for us to take orders of our drinks. The waiter also didn't offer to clear the plates etc. For the food quality, the only recommended dish would be fries & wings. Calamari is too oily with loads of batter, same as the fish fingers. Pizza is average and the only thing you can prob order and feel satisfied are the burgers. Overall, loads of improvement in service, paying attention to customers needs. Food wise, it has to be re-looked. With such standards, I don't see how it can compete with other pubs.
3
Came back here for lunch today with some colleagues. We were pretty much the only customers. Opted for the set lunch which consisted of a soup, salad and a main. Food was ok but nothing remarkable. Last time was quite a bit better. Not sure if I'll be back in a hurry.
5
Family enjoyed the steak buffet. Started with sample plater and you are free to order any items for your 2hr dinner seating. Food was delicious, love the ribeye. Beer battered fish coated with too much batter. Could improve on presentation of food items: Our sample meat plater was piled on top of the garlic fries; this made the fries soggy. Service staff was friendly and polite. Nice place for beer.
1
The beer selection is great. The burgers tastes awesome (properly flame grilled). The interior is cosy and nice. The service is a total disaster. We were a company of 10 persons with a reservation at 7 PM on a Friday. The restaurant was full - but not overcrowded. The first beer came 15 minutes after order (and several reminders). The food took 1h 20m before it arrived - for some of us. For others it took 20m... After several "negotiations" the staff agreed to discount 20 % of the bill. After discount we ended up paying 47,50 SGD for a burger and a couple of beers - which would've been a very good price if the food and drinks didn't take so long. Loud live music playing this night so we couldn't communicate with each mother (only with the person next to you). Sorry but I can't at all recommend this place due to the terrible organisation and poor service.

We went to the Armoury for their steak buffet that they are providing on weekend nights. The concept is great, you get a platter of different cuts of beef and then are able to ask more of whatever types you like most. The platters also come with a selection of sides like mantou, toppaki, mushroom soup and veggies. The idea is great but the execution not so much. There were 3 people at our table and they initially brought out a platter that was big enough for 1, a bit of each side and a small cut of each meat. We assumed that they would bring out the platters for the other 2 people shortly. We were wrong. Apparently they wanted everyone to share one small platter and then keep ordering (this was never actually explained, we had to guess based upon observation), when each of the subsequent orders took at least 20 minutes to come out. An hour later, we finally were able to convince them (after asking about 5 times) to bring out two more platters. When the platters were brought out, almost everything on them was already cold. The food was good despite being cold, but the incompetence of the organization and waitstaff definitely put a damper on the experience. With a bucket of beer and a buffet each, came out to $50/pax. Too much to pay for the hassle we had to go through to even get the food in the first place.

I've visited the restaurant twice. The first time i was there, I had one of their burgers, which was great. I heard about it because it was voted one of the best burgers in town.The 2nd time i was there was for a steak buffet promotion they were having. The food was prepared using sou vide and tasted great! The price was pretty attractive as well
2
No reply from calls or email to book a large group reservation. Half of the menu not available to order and they ran out of Co2 gas to enable the draft beer taps so had to drink bottles of Heineken. No real customer focus and food very avergae and overprice
4
Gotta be one of the best burgers in town! That combined with the Rogue Brown Ale nectar is superb. Please make sure to keep this up, guys.
3
Went there once before, was a good experience. They served many varities of meat but my favourite was still their beef. :)
4
The Prata chicken is surprisingly good! Look like a taco but taste like a Prata I love. ;) happy hour for weekend whole day so great for drinkers. Great service too.
3
place was decent and chill, while the food portions were a little small even though pricey. happy hour drinks were affordable, while normal priced drinks were average-pricey.
2
Disgusting and dirty toilet and only one to serve all the nearby outlets. Will not be back. Worst is to drink and put up with the disgusting bathrooms or lack of.
3
Limited choices, steak was so so and not hot. However, reasonable for the price paid. Wouldn't recommend to dine with kids because mostly are bar stool

We were waiting for our movie and decided to have a quick beers and happened to see this place.When we reached place was all empty with reserved sign on all tables. We already told them we are only going to spend 30 mins but still so hesitant to give us outside seats. When we were almost walking away to next place, all of sudden they managed to get a table for us in this empty bar. Before we get our table, they made us change three tables. Finally we got table, and ordered drinks quickly as we have to catch movie. More than 15 mins no beers appear on our table (we only ordered beer not any fancy cocktails). Apparently waitress forget about our order. Placed an order again, by the time we received beers, it was our time to go. We had to drink them in rush.Last but not least, when we asked for a bill their system wasn't working. So they manually calculated bill amount.Caution - In outdoor area, chairs' seats were so wet which made my husband's trouser wet. Be careful while using them.
1
I was just passing by with my husband and felt like I needed a good craft beer. But to my surprise, although the WHOLE place was nearly empty, it was such a problem to give us even two chairs to sit down (we were not asking for a table). Such a shame that so called good craft beer bar is such lazy with its clients. Extremely disappointed. I hope this message serves for something. This is why many places in Singapore don't last opened for long
1
After calling the restaurant three separate times (during open hours) to make a reservation I opted to use hungrygowhere to make a reso. When we arrived we were told that they not only do not honour reservations made through that website but that there was also nothing they could do to offer us a table. Two people. Turned away. So disappointed
4
Had dinner with my wide one Saturday night. Wasn't crowded when we got there. Service was excellent. Friendly and welcoming. Ok my wife's burger came 15mins before my salmon which was a bit disappointing but the servers were all great. Special shout out to Venetta who was extremely patient in answering questions. The Armoury burger was nice and I liked the salmon as it was pink inside unlike the usual dried out salmon you get when it's pan fried or roasted. They got it just right. Portion weren't large but was sufficient
5
Good place for dinner and brews/drinks. Went there prior to concert, so needed a fast and tasty dinner. The Armoury delivered. Steak and burgers were above average, but biggest plus was the availability of Portland craft beers - Rogue and Deschutes. Nice atmosphere as well.
4
Cheap and good food for a central location like South Beach. The atmosphere was pretty upbeat with great music and reasonably-priced alcohol (of course, that takes centre-stage in a bar).
4
Nice cosy place for hangouts (both small or huge 8pax groups) wide varieties of drinks to choose from.
3
The Armoury is in a historic building in the new South Beach development. The food is OK but nothing special. It is reasonably priced. The service was slow. Overall, it's not a bad place to stop but there are better choices.
2
Quite hard to locate the restaurant. Phoned the restaurant for directions repeatedly but no answer. No staff to direct you to a table when you arrive. All 3 appear to be at-risk youths who stare blankly while you seat yourself. Mynahs hopping about inside the restaurant nibbling on food scraps on the floor. Questionable service staff who cluster together to chat. Burgers were acceptable but not worth a return visit. A lot of online hype but mostly blogger written drivel. Should be closing very soon.
1
My friends and I visited the restaurant on a Friday night and waited for our truffle fries for more than an hour. We were willing to give the restaurant a second chance by ordering chicken wings but the staff informed us that the chicken wings were out of stock even though we saw that it was being served to another table, and it being a Friday night. We had requested to speak to someone of a managerial position in the restaurant, but no one bothered entertaining us. Please do only visit for the drinks, otherwise, dont bother!
4
Not popular as other cafes but nevertheless had a lovely brunch here. Theyve recently changed the menu so their fantastic berry ricotta pancakes are no longer available, though the chef very kindly agreed to prepare it on request. They even apologised for the slow service and gave us dessert on the house as a gesture. Kudos to the armoury team. Such service is really hard to come by these days
4
I returned to the Armoury today for lunch with a visiting colleague. The lunch deals are still very good value. Today I had a beef brisket rice bowl and supplemented with soup and icecream whilst my colleague had the spaghetti with soup and a coke. Total bill was only $26. Really good value. They don't seem to have the $2 coffees any more though
3
"The ice drip coffee is brewed over 12 hours, while the cold brew coffee is only 8 hours" explains our waiter. It's that kinda place. Of course we hipsters love it, but fair warning it may not be your jam. For us, bowls are the flavour du jour - donburi, poke, acai. As is premium local fare. The Armoury delivers then the perfect nexus of kurobuta scissor cut rice, souvi chicken rice, etc. All solid, if slightly premium ($18-$24). Oh and wear a jacket, the aircon fan speed is set to "wind tunnel"
5
Great place for a relaxed evening with friends. Weekdays are usually crowded because of the number of offices in the area, however, you can easily get a place over a weekend. Went at 8 pm on a Saturday and could easily get a place. Tried the margherita pizza and the buffalo wings. The wings were amazing! They have 5 different levels of spice, and level 2 for me was just perfect
5
A friend was heading back to Hong Kong & we thought it would be nice to have a dinner gathering together before she leave.
5
Enjoyed this well prepared burger very much with couple of craft beers from the tap! Came here after my long day of slogging in the office, definitely will pay this Gastrobar a visit again!
4
Very pleasant place to dine. Good quality and fresh food is served by friendly waiters. Indoors and outdoors tables available.
4
Beer is okay. With happy hour, there are only two types available. But not too bad. free snacks are good. Other food.is also.not bad. Just right below office, easy place to hang out with friends and colleagues.
2
Armoury touts its craft beers, but the selection was very limited. I found only one that I liked, and it wasn't unique. Service needs help--management should hire more staff to help. Our server was over-worked, though she tried hard and was very pleasant to us. The band outside was lousy and loud, which made conversation difficult even inside where we were. Decent atmosphere (room design and historic building), except for the annoying band
5
Myself being an avid aficionado in japanese cuisine , have deemed that they serve the best for value chirashi bowl in the whole city hall area , definitely a must BUY. The table service and coffee was exceptional as well. To the owners of the armoury , please continue what you're doing , you've definitely got a fan in me
5
I enjoyed the vibe at this beer house which offers more than 10 types of beers. From Guiness, Erdinger, to craft beers. My favorite beer is the Deschutes IPA with its floral tasting IPA.The staff here are very friendly and always happy to serve us. I will definitely come back again and again for beer.Best Bar Bite - UNAGI tempuraBest Beer - Deschutes IPABest Mains - Chicken Cho
3
Had some refreshing craft beer from the tap which was good and some calamari (overpriced) to go with it, decided not to have dinner as the mains were pricey. This restaurant with dim lighting is suitable for a quiet dinner date or having conversations, not really crowded for a Friday evening
5
With so many type of beers offerred here, the armoury is my regular hang out spot at South Beach Quarters. Guiness, erdinger, craft beers are all available. Goes well with their great fries and burgers. Dont miss out their profiteroles too.Music is great, location is solid.
5
The Armoury is located in a relatively new shop, dine and hotel area: THE SOUTH BEACH. The quaint restaurant operates from morning to night. Of course what attracts most is the 14 beer taps on the wall for the beer lovers. Happy Hour is from 5pm- 9pm ( very generous). The bar food are also very delicious and substantial quantity. The taps feat. the usual ones like Kirin, Heineken and Tiger. But they also have unique ones from USA and Europe , Germany. Japan Hitachino is also on the taps. Besides beer, there are also other types of liquor, wine and cocktails. The weekdays are packed with many deals such as buckets at good prices. Staff are very friendly and help to introduce the beers. If you are taking MRT just come of out Exit F , get to the ground level and walk towards the Golden Mile area direction, you will be able to see the pub restaurant clearl
4
Everything was pretty good! Except closing time a bit earlier than expected. Would be better if happy hour promotion have more choices as well.
5
Love the food, the ambience, the coffee the beer. Service is outstanding. Steak served the way I wanted it.
5
Good food with affordable drinks staff was nice and polite. Nice place to chill out with friends and family.
4
Came here for lunch today to try the $10 set lunch. Remarkably good value: a miso soup, small side salad and some noodles with salmon. And a pretty decent latte for just $2 also. Not bad at all.
3
This is my second time at Armoury and the burger size is reduced but prices have increased! Nevertheless quality of the burger remains top
4
Great place for after office drinks and catching up with friends over a few beers. Quite a wide variety of beer available. Their hi-tables were a little cramped for space for food and drinks. Regular tables which were for large groups looked ok.
4
Enjoyed the beef burger - I asked for medium rare, & this was juicy & tasty.You could swap the default sweet potato chips out for fries, but at the risk of them forgetting. They messed up our red wine order too (they served us white), but in all, I wouldn't mind coming back here again.Some facts: Accepts credit cards, air-conditioned seats & al fresco ones both available, no WiFi (boo), accepts reservations - I used Chope.
5
My first trip here was last week friday, it was full house however the staff provided very nice service. Coming several times to apologies and reassuring that it will only take a few minutes more. When we got seated, I ordered the cod fish. Usually most codfish smell can be very overwhelming but the fish was fresh and the taste was really good. Good range of craft beers as well, especially the coffee stout was my favourite
3
Visited the place on 14 Oct for friends' belated birthday celebrations. The place suffers from a case of confused identity, imho.Location and decoration: place was not easily recognizable. While it is part of south beach, but it is really at the colonial house side just beside Shaw Towers. Lighting was dimmed halfway which made it more loungey. But place was quite nicely done up. Service: crew was helpful and went about their service well. No complains. They even agreed to loan their apple charging cable! Food: think the place is unsure about trying to be a gastroplace, pub, cafe or restaurant. Menu was focused but came across as more cafe food but had wide range of beers and alcohols. More efforts should be spent on plating. Menu was more cafe but plating was done restaurant-esque. serving portion was awkward. Say 40bucks for the miso cod which was a just a little too small a cut. Flavours were generally pleasant but a little on the salty end.Suggestion would be for the place to relook its focus. Identity is a little jumbled up and is a shame to see the place not really filled up on a Sat. Hope it is because of early days of operations. Jia you!
5
So happy to have a chill and fun cafe near my office where my colleagues and I can get away from our miserable office at Suntec. Great music, great coffee by yellow cup, delicious cakes, great wine, great craft beer. Everything is found here. Food is super. Comfortable seatings. Good vibe. Best is we can hide from our bosses and enjoy a slack afternoon
