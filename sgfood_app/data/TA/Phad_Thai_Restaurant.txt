Good papaya salad, other than that fairly average. Their mango shake does not appear to contain any mango from the taste of it. Definitely overpriced.

I really enjoyed eating at this place, because the food is fairly priced, full of flavor and the dishes are a decent size. Consistency isn't their strong point, but I never had a bad experience there. Both the green and red curry are amazing, and everything else I tried was pretty good. They have a 10 dollar menu thru the day, with plenty of options... well worth a try

I was in Thailand for a week and when I got back here I got this holiday hangover and still craving for Thai foods so I decided to pay this resto a visit. And yeah its closest to an authentic thai food and the price is reasonable. The place is very laid back you can eat alfresco on the side of the street or inside. I love their green thai curry and chicken mango salad. Their tomyum and I forgot the name of a fish in sauce are also really good.

I visited Phad Thai this week with some work colleagues and have to say it was a wonderful experience. I loved the 'press for staff attention' device, and the service was prompt and friendly.The food was excellent - some of the best I've tasted outside Thailand itself. I said a quick hello to the chef: a lovely old Thai gentleman. I loved the Khau Phad Gai, Green Chicken Curry and Mango Salad the best.Well recommende

Service at Phat Thai was very good. They have a device on every table that a customer could press to get the staff's attention. Food was very well prepared, both taste and presentation, and is value for money. Overall dining experience was pleasant. Phat Thai is a must try! Will definitely go back for more

Staying at albert court hotel, a short stroll away near little india station is this funky little eatery. Simple, understated and functional. Firstly, the menus were confusing as some pages in each had been removed. We were able to sort it out and ordered a paad thai and a red chicken curry. It was a pleasant surprise to see that the menu offered a good selection of dishes without going overboard. Favourites like green curry, a selection of rice and noodle dishes, salads and fish done several ways. There was a little wait, but the place was busy. Both dishes were well done. The noodles were light, spicy and mildly herbed. I would compare this with anything ive had in thailand. Thought the serve size was a little small, but then it wasnt expensive. Red curry of chicken was among the best ive tasted. The best was in chiang mai. If anything, a little mild considering i ordered 2 out of 3 for chilli. All in all a pleasant dining experience. Very good flavour balances and adequate, polite service. Thank you

Phad Thai is a real island of Thailand in the middle of Singapore. It's great location near the Little India MRT makes it easy to go there. There is also car parking opposite in a public compound, free after 5 pm. We went with a group of friends. Service was very good, fast and attentive. We had our own compartment al freso. Their Thai dishes are created by a chef from Chiang May in Northern Thailand. Their designer dish is Phad Thai, as the name of their restaurant. Chicken with cashew nuts tastes delicious. We can recommend to all Thai Food lovers

One of the things I love about Singapore is that you can cross a main road and find yourself in a completely different world. This restaurant was a great find. It is located close to the Little India MRT station and is a great spot to sit and watch the world go by while you eat.The service is prompt and friendly and the food is delicious.Most dishes on the menu were less than $10 SGDSome of the outdoor tables had a green wheelie bin on the street next to them, which is not very nice, more attention to detail is needed
