Was a good pub but hygiene standards have dropped. Beer last week was coming through a dirty pump and there was scum in the surface as a result. Today I was given brown ice!
5
Very neat and clean facility with great food and a good selection of drinks. The entertainment on one night was excellent. It has a great ambiance and was a wonderful place to relax with a drink.
4
Visited this establishment about 4 or 5 times during our stay. Thought the food was excellent and at a reasonable expense. Staff was attentive and friendly. Happy hour is the best time to visit.
4
We have been dropping in here most nights for a night cap and working our way thru the cocktail list. The staff are very friendly.

Ambience is nice. Loved the music they played in Restaurant...some I haven't heard in a long time.Place is clean. Large bar.Husband ordered Club sandwich and said it was fine. I ordered the chicken thigh burger-this was surprisingly Good!!! Come with some greens and fries on side.Brownie and ice cream ...well firstly not a brownie it was a small chocolate cake. And the ice cream was not good and seemed like it was frozen burned. Not fresh ice cream.Service was fine

OK Irish pub in a mall on a busy street. Generally boring range of beers - lagers & weissbiers, slightly improved by Guinness, Kilkenny and a couple of bottled ciders, but nothing very interesting or unusual - no craft beer.A little disorganized - every reservation by eatigo laboriously transcribed to paper, which can cause delays if you book just before you go. Also minimal bar snack selection - no peanuts.Tghe food quality saves this place from a lower rating - everything is hot, fresh and well-prepared. The sauted garlic prawns and beef stew were both delicious, although I would have preferred the stew to be offered with some potato or other side dish. Still, excellent quality.S$101 for two ciders, two beers, appetizer and main (with a 10% eatigo discount on the food)

We visited a few times during our stay in Singapore as the bar was just around the corner from our hotel . Couple of times we just had drinks - happy hour is 12 noon - 9pm !! We ate a couple of times too - loved the sausage and mash we were missing UK food . Live music some nights which was goo
4
The atmosphere is good. Conveniently located near bras basah mrt. Staffs are friendly although they may not be prompt to serving you.The cocktails are worth going for. Ciders are priced reasonably compared to other places. Advised to go after you had dinner elsewhere; or just get their bar bites to go with your drinks
4
We took a rain break in here then enjoyed the happy hour (runs til 9pm)Good beers, Guinness and service. Had some ribs and some spring rolls as a pre dinner snack, they were very niceGreat selection in the shelves of whisky, whiskey, gin etc. Seen some bad reports on here but I only have good things to sa

Where do we start. We attended this Irish style pub on Saturday the 14th October due to the EPL football being shown on the big screen, To start with the beer prices are expensive at $12 a pint for the local Tiger beer, and increasing to $14.50 on Saturday match day. After a couple of beers I asked for a glass of iced water as the venue was very hot inside and was told I could only have a bottle of spring water at $8 each. We also decided to have a meal before the start of the match. What a mistake that was. We ordered the "Irish Lamb Stew" It was far from a stew it was the most tasteless stew we have ever had with tinned Potato, baby carrots and peas. The lamb was more fat than meat. To add insult to injury my partner and I had the same meal and we both got the runs. Don't go near the place
4
Good food and drinks at reasonable prices for singapore . Could not fault the service either .will visit again next time I'm in singapore .
4
Great spot for a nice feed, nice and handy to our hotel( Rendezvous). Would definetly recomend for good food and service.
5
After many days of eating all Asian food, a real treat to find great spare ribs and pizza for a change. Excellent value for money, friendly helpful staff and again, great food. Would highly recommend
4
Great for a drink, or two. Live music is brilliant, no Irish music though. Didn't see ANY Irish people so not sure why they call it an Irish pub. But still a great place for a drink and to relax. Good staff.
4
Very nice restaurant and bar combined with excellent service and good tucker. Some outside setting when we visited. Menu is good with something for every taste. The bar is well complimented with imported drinks of all kinds. We can definitely recommend the Spatchcock and the whiskey bbq ribs - just succulent. Beer prices are up a bit, but it IS a very nice waterhole. We'll be back.Cheers Niels & Mary, Humpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Unde

You will only get rudeness and eye rolling from their waitress there.What more? when you bring up the issue to the manager or bartender, all he can say is sorry and he will talk to the staff. specifically inform them to not open my beer they did and they refuse to change new bottles.First and last visit
1
I visited Molly Roffey's twice on my visit to Singapore. The first time I had some drinks and a seafood pizza which I enjoyed. The restaurant appeared clean and staff were helpful.The second time I visited I was just having drinks and sitting at the bar. This time I witnessed the Chef go to the bathroom and return to the kitchen without washing his hands. I also witnessed one of the staff topping up previously poured old pints over and over again and serving these to unsuspecting customers who were sitting at tables. This has potential to make people very ill. I worked as a barman previously and have seen this on occasion but never in a decent establishment.I would never go back. If you are ordering drinks ensure you watch the bar staff pour fresh drinks for you! As friendly as they are they could make you very ill with unhygienic practises.
3
I would say... this is average food and drinks, but if you stay around Bras Basah and just doesn't want to go deep into the crowded places, this is great. What i suggest.Have a Chinese food dinner next door, Ding Tai Fung. Finish your dinner, hope over here for some beer.
3
This is a restaurant /bar scene. It is a clinically clean place if you get my meaning with great screens throughput for televised sporting occasions. This is an Irish bar in name only . Went there for one reason to see Ireland playing in a world cup qualifier had to tell staff about it. But at 55 dollars for 2 pints and 2 glasses of Heineken would not be back on a hurry. Lacks totally in atmosphere. Not your typical Irish bar would not return in a hurry
4
I went with my wife and daughter (2 yo) on a Sunday night (Arsenal vs Man Utd match). The pub was barely half filled and most were there for the soccer match. The nacho chips was pretty value for money ($15) as the portion is big. They allowed young kids in the pub but no baby chair is available. The staff were attentive and friendly.
4
We had dinner and drinks here. Food is good value for money and service was great. Good variety of beverages and live music on Wednesday and Fridays.
5
Loads of draft beers on tap, including Guinness. Very nice Irish pub in Singapore. Food is also great. Reasonably priced for a Singapore establishment. Plus a small live band on certain nights
5
Great spot for enjoying a night out with great food and fabulous entertainment - and service with a smile! Check out the live music and the great cocktails.
3
Dropped by quickly for a cider on our first stop for a cool drink in Singapore. Nice looking venue.
Ok for a first taster of Singapore.
3
The food was average and the service was below average. You could tell that the server did not want to be there. I had to get her attention so she could take my order and I had to go find her to get the bill. I would not visit this place again nor would I recommend to anyone else
3
Well, not really because this bar seems to be built in to a corner of a shopping center and that doesn't happen so much at home.I was in Singapore for work and wanted to watch a rugby match, after asking a random guy in an Irish jersey on the street where I could watch it, he suggested here. It's like expat central and seemed to be a crowd mostly there to watch the rugby on one of their many screens.I had a couple of pints of Guiness and it was fine but expensive ($12 USD/ â‚¬11 each). Drinks in Singapore are expensive though so that shouldn't be a surprise. Would I be in a rush back? No, probably not to be honest, The Irish bar far away from home isn't really my thing but if I'm ever back in Singapore and wanted to watch a match, it'd be the first place I'd seek out
2
Visited by myself on Saturday night to watch the early Football game (about 8pm). Not very busy so easily found table. Happy hour runs til 9pm but even with happy hour, pints still $12-$14 so not a great saving Had four drinks or so in total and Staff reasonably attentive. Main criticism is that on Saturday night when everyone is watching Football they stop serving food at 930 sharp. I tried ordering at 932 (no one having come round to see if there were any last orders) and was refused. Others were also told likewise - they are losing a lot of business here and on a Saturday night when crowd comes in to watch the Football the lack of food is disappointing.
5
... if only I lived in Singapore!Visited last week, once for a birthday dinner and once for drinks and had a great time both nights. The staff are lovely, happy and welcoming. The food is pub grub but very nicely done. Drinks are pretty standard Singapore prices but it was good to see some $10 cocktails ... keep the Chocolate Martinis coming!This is generally a sports bar during the day and on weekends, I think but on week nights they have live music. We loved this aspect of the place and returned the second night really to hear them play - good, honest musos who obviously love what they do. Highly recommend this friendly bar
3
Molly Roffey's is a well located and popular pub in the Bras Basah area of Singapore, at the bottom end of Orchard Road. It provides good basic fare and is a good after work or holiday meeting place. If eating choose carefully as it is mixed with some nice dishes. Avoid the glazed ham as it is a truly awful experience and am sure even the poor pig was embarrassed. Needs to be removed from the menu as it lets the place down
4
It is a nice place to go and sit at a table or bar and have a good bite to eat and a good drink. The service is really good all the servers work together and always have a smile on there face. If anything they got flat screen tvs with sports on to watch.
4
Not so much people but nice place. Nice music and staff is nice. Taste new drink and they come ask what I like it, nice customer service.
Place look nice and atmosphere is good.
3
Pub was quiet but service was excellent. Food was yum and good value for money. Nothing fancy but great spot for a quiet lunch or beer
3
It's an average Irish Pub and could be anywhere in the world.
As everything else in Singapore it's quite expensive.
5
Good drinks and open til 2 am. Kitchen closes early but nice spot with live music and friendly staff
4
We had a business lunch here the other day. It was a nice quiet place right in the city for discussion. The food was reasonable - cost and taste wise. If your business contact fancy a beer or a wine, no problem either.
4
I came here on my first night in Singapore with my sister and her husband. Enjoyed our champagne and creme de cassis cocktails (I wouldn't recommend the liquid cocaine - vodka, red bull, and champagne). Staff were very friendly and attentive. Overall the place was nice and if you want to watch the football (I didn't), they have a huge projector screen
5
It was crowded, but still excellent vibe. They had an excellent live band on a friday evening. They were also showing the olympics on the night we had gone. Overall great experience. The drink are interesting, so try anything that sounds good. We tried quite a few of the cocktails, and all of them were grea
3
I had a grilled steak with fried egg, served with sauted vegetables and fries in a mushroom sauce and a pint of Tiger beer. The beer tasted very good, but I have tasted better meals than this at other places.Look for more reviews by MulleEllum
4
It's really gorgeous on the inside. The interiors are mind blowing. It's just a afternoon drink of latte, should be just chatting. Well turns out to be admiring at the interiors. Wine glasses, the arrangements of the bottles and lightings make it stand out. Well they have a friendly lady to serve us.:) so good to go
1
Despite good reviews about this place....... Unfortunately...my experience is not good.....Called at 9pm for reservation at 9.30pm and they accepted the reservation but no courtesy or initiative to inform kitchen last order at 9.30pm. When we arrived at 9.30pm approximately, food menu were handed to us. At about 9.35pm while we were placing almost all orders with the staff, the staff suddenly excused herself suddenly and rushed off from our table. Came back only 10 minutes later to inform kitchen is closed. We can only offer barbites...... 8 of us were hungry.....Air con was not cold and we felt stuffy and requested if the ceiling fans could be on. Staff was nice and turned it on, saying that will on for 30mins and off after that. We were cool about it. However, it was switched off within 5 minutes and leaving us perspiring throughout the night. Sad to say..... They turned it off because 2 regular patrons asked to off it..... Tequila hot wings and truffles fries are not bad. Interior design looks good.....However, maturity of staff handling customers relations is not there, many miscommunications within staff, bias treatment towards customers.... Would not recommend to friends and family to this place. It's a disappointment
3
A cold pint of Erdinger in an airconditioned bar...all you can wish for on a hot July afternoon. Great!
The owner is obviously a big Arsenal-fan. The staff is Asian. So where's the "Irish" in this Irish Pub? Not anywhere.
4
This pub is a fine location for viewing sporting matches, such as football (soccer) and rugby. I had a beer and appetizer which were just fine, but probably not enough to comment on the overall quality of entrees, etc.
4
Was stopping over in Singapore last month and a friend suggested this pub as I stayed in a hotel nearby.
The atmosphere was great and very friendly waitress...
I was very impressed with the food they serve.
Overall it was great... Thoroughly enjoyed it...
3
We went there during happy hour thinking the beer would cost reasonable. We were wrong. Not sure why this place priced their beer given their location. Service was good though.
5
Awesome pub and prices are reasonable , friendly staff and food is really nice. Live music. They support Arsenal FC and have live football games on tv. This pub has a nice feel about it.
4
Been to a lot of Irish pubs around the world - most are pale imitations. This one has really good food at a reasonable price - fish and chips was spectacular and they have HP sauce. Live entertainment was a bonus.
4
I had just arrived in Singapore, late at night mind you (which seems to be when the plane from Melbourne tends to arrive), and this place was still open, serving beer, and happy for me to pay by card. If that is all that the pub can offer for a weary traveller looking for a beer, then it is certainly worth it. Also the staff were quite friendly, and they even had a small band playing some background music. Definitely a place to check out, particularly since it was pretty quiet when I passed through here
3
Stopped in here for quick drink , waitress quite friendly and helpful , prices are similar to normal prices here in Singapore . It was a Friday evening so the place was just beginning to get busy . As we left a local band was beginning to play music
3
My friend stayed at the hotel nearby and we decided to stop for drinks and snack here yesterday. Around 4 ish and about approx 10 customers in the pub. It was so hard to call any staff down to take order. We was scare to order food. Coz it might be long waiting time. So we only have a few drinks and left. Hard to flags someone over for the bill at the end also
4
Went to watch the last Arsenal game of the season. Had checked online food and drink, but unfortunately when I got there the menu was different (more expensive for the ell game) and no food was being served.Would have been nice if they even had some simple bar snacks.Atmosphere Great for a match though, and bar staff were nice and friendl
5
Popped in for something to eat only by chance. What a lucky found.
Food was very good, staff friendly and good value for money.
Seemed to be one of the only places open for lunch if you don't want a coffee shop.
5
Nice place to pop in for a drink or two after seeing the sights. Quieter area, away from the Marina. Nice at weekends when they have excellent live band playing. Enjoyed our stay
5
Have visited many times and food is really good , and service also is good , recommend once visit Singapore.
5
We had the Crab bake and the chicken wings (the sauce for the winga is really hot, but very tasty!). The staff are very friendly and helpful. Had a great time here and we'll be back tomorrow!
5
Atmosphere pretty quiet. Went there for Brunches as next to hotel we stayed at(Dorsett Hotel).
Food is good with reasonable prices compared to other Irish bars in Singapore.
3
Convenient to our hotel is the best thing I can say about the place. Service was fine but it's pricey and the food was just o.k. Lacking in atmosphere but that might be the time of day we ate.
4
We had Ribs & Lamb Stew. Both $17 ea. Great value. Ribs were really good they fell off the bone and chips and lettuce also nice. Stew probably not quite as good but still not bad at all. Drinks quite expensive but it cost overall the same as 2 thin pizza and cokes somewhere else last night. This was much better!
4
This place was perfect for us being basically a block from our hotel. Great selection of beers and quite a good menu (though the kitchen seems to close quite early) nice and clean with quick and friendly service. The place isn't very Irish but the commitment to The Arsenal cannot be questioned!!!!! The place is adorned in memorabilia. Great hangout for all your sporting needs
4
Not a lot of atmosphere as far as Irish pubs go. The food is great as are the female staff members who are there for lunch. They're welcoming, friendly & efficient. The male staff didn't really care as we found when we went for dinner one night, As a crowd of 8 our meals were brought out together which was excellent
4
It close to our hotel and as my husband does not eat much Asia food it was a God send after traveling 8 half hour from Sydney to Singapore and just getting out, the place was very clean and we were welcome at the door and seated, we were given menu straight away and it was in English and Chinese and prices were mark and the prices was good, we had a beer each and my daughter had a sider, we had the fish and chips not bad portion and the food as good yes I would recommend it
4
I went for a pint and stayed for too many chatting to a friend and listening to Suave, a 3 member Singapore band. Highly recommended.
3
We were here for drink only after dinner. The services by Philippines was quite good. The cocktails that we ordered done right. House pour red is also good. Enjoyed our late evening here.
5
Loved this place. Great service and top notch food. Great value. The staff are all very friendly and the pub is very clean and well designed. It is also the home of football in Singapore.
4
I stopped for lunch at Molly Roffey's. The restaurant has a great pub atmosphere, very spacious with lots of tables for small or large groups. I ordered the fish and chips, and the serving was quite generous and served very hot. The service was very efficient too. If you're looking for an alternative to Asian food, this is a good place
4
3 of us visited this restaurant for dinner on 11 Oct for a birthday celebration.We started with half dozen Hazelnut escargot - well seasoned.Then we shared the following,- Irish Brown Crab Bake- Guinness & Oxtail Pie- Buffalo Wings- Irish Lamb Stew- Smoked Duck Pizza (my 1st time tasting this ... real nice .. pizza never tasted this good)Apart from the Buffalo Wings and Irish Lamb Stew, the rest are Signature Dishes.The food was well prepared.Portions not overly large.The Buffalo Wings seemed to have some crunchy bits on the outside, seemed like chopped nuts or something .. complements nicely.The place was decked with Arsenal Football Club's paraphernalia, as it is the official fan club for Arsenal FC.A number of patrons sat facing the TVs with the F1 race (Russian segment) live feed.Molly's ambience brings back pleasant memories of dining at "The Claire Inn" on Dominion Road in Auckland, which incidentally is an Irish Pub which serves great award-winning food.Readily recommend a visit to Molly Roffey's
3
We had half a rack of ribs each and shared the Guinness chocolate cake. Rib portions were big and filling and came with fries and mesclun. I wouldn't say it's very juicy but it falls off the bone easily and the sauce was tasty. The chocolate cake was average, in fact, a bit dry, and we couldn't taste the Guinness at all. Drinks were not cheap but I guess that's pub price in Singapore.
5
We had a 200gm steak with fries and a small salad for $24. We also dined during happy hour so beer was slightly cheaper but still expensive as everywhere seems to be in Singapore. We were also given snacks while we were drinking - the Singaporean equivalent of beer nuts :) Service was good and the steak was cooked perfectly
5
If you are an Arsenal fan, you can't miss this place on Arsenal match night. It can be very crowded so plan to arrive early. We arrived at 7 pm, 45 minutes before the match and couldn't get a table so we had to be at the bar instead.Excellent atmosphere on football night with good food and beers
4
Atmosphere pretty quiet. Only went there for Brunches as next to hotel we stayed at.The girls were fantastic, even recognising us in the MRT and saying hi. The guys on the other hand.... avoid and return when the girls are working, much better quality of service and attitude.Meals were just enough choice and came out fairly paced between courses
4
Walked by this place around 3pm and stopped in for 4 pints oh Guinness, place was very quiet I was the only customer, but the beer was cold and the service was friendly and good, I didn't eat there but the menu looked good, with reasonable prices compared to other irish bars in Singapore. I personally like a quiet bar to chill and relax with a cold beer
4
We enjoyed two meals here, as it was closed to our hotel. Good food and fun entertainment for weary travellers.
2
Thought we would try a beer before deciding if we should eat here. After the bill came to $29 for 2 beers,we left.
2
Perhaps we caught it on a bad night, but over priced drinks and average 'pub grub'. There was live music on the night we went, which was ok but nothing specially. You are bettert off walking a bit further for a better choice.
4
Happened to visit the place during weekend, nice place to hang out with beautiful view of merlion and bay. Being a vegetarian have option in pizza. Must try Guinness from tap with beautiful view.
5
Loved this little pub, they had great specials and the food was delicious. Service was 10/10 and very quick
1
Very poor service asked for a steak with mushroom sauce got pepper sauce when I complained they scraped off the sauce and added mushroom steak arrived before I had finished the soup that I didn't order but came as a "special" very expensive as well
2
5pm and no one to be seen. Had a pint of mothers milk and moved on. It did have free wifi to write this review so not all bad!
Would have thought irish music as a minimum would have been in order.
1
You would think you can rely on an Irish Pub for some good grub and a bit of atmosphere. Side step this one if that is what you want. We even had the joy of watching one of the kitchen staff washing himself in the kitchen sink....including his nose cleaning. Over priced and indifferent staff......disappointed.
2
I spent three evenings in Molly's, and I wish I had better news to report. All around the globe Irish Pubs are focal points for fun, noisy, and generally happy tippling. Not here. The tables are empty, the bartender is bored, the drinks are measured with scientific precision and if it wasn't the bar closest to the Dorsett Hotel I never would have gone back again. Avoid at all costs
5
Mollys was just around the corner from our hotel we ate in there a few times or popped in just for a drink.The staff are all very friendly the food was lovely just enough choice.The pup is very much an Arsenal fans dream pub as it is full of arsenal memorabilia.My husband is a spurs man but this didn't put him off.There is live entertainment on most evenings which was very good.If you are in the area its well worth a visit
3
Went for food just as kitchen was closing but they let us order. We both ordered steak pie and were happy to see a big plate of it a few minutes later. Not as good as home but quality and price was ok for Singapore.
2
As an Irish pub pretty poor, has TVs with football and not much else when I frequented the bar. Beer and some nachos ( as served in a cinema) was 23SGD not great value for money.
3
I visited mid afternoon on a Sunday.
Pleasant service and a nice place to enjoy a cold beer in an air conditioned pub.
A pint of Tiger came to $12.50.
5
Ambience is nice
They have diff variety of beers and this strikes it out
Secondly music is not loud but i found service a bit stale.
Def recommend this place for a bunch of friends to hang out
2
Went to this bar to see the opening Irish match of this years Six Nations 2015. It was full of Arsenal fans viewing a derby match with Spurs and signs were up on the window that fans wearing opposition jerseys would not be admitted by bouncers. Health and safety? Most normal bars dont need such measures but when I got inside and felt the hostile atmosphere the decision seemed to make sense. We were shown over to our seats which was frankly weird and when I enquired about the Irish game which had just started would be on one of the sports scrï¿½ens I got blank looks and after explaining the rugby was on was informed even though the arsenal match had now ended that they d turn over to the Irish match 'maybe later'. We got the hell out of there but missed most of the first half which was annoying. Perhaps its harsh overall so I hope to go back on a non sporting day and enjoy it more perhaps without the turn off of been a non-Arsenal fan in a horde of Arsenal fan
2
This pub is located close to all the major tourist sights which may explain how ridiculous the prices were. I ordered a baileys which at $14 was the most expensive baileys ever and to make it worse the drink was tiny. I couldn't understand how they could sell such a small portion. Beers are $20 for a pint. Only go to this pub if you have money to burn! A
4
Staying in the nearby Dorsett hotel I had been studiously avoid Molly Roffey's based on my usual prejudice against Irish pubs (cliche). Finally I caved and went in, searching hard for decent alternatives to Chinese food in Chinatown. I should have caved earlier.Although branded as Irish, Molly Roffey's is not ostensibly Irish (if anything it feels like an Arsenal supporters' bar). But what it did have was some pretty excellent food, at fairly affordable prices. Beer was pretty standard fare (in range and price) for Singapore, but I shall certainly be returning for the half rack of ribs
3
This pub is ok, the night we went in it was pretty quiet, English football on big screens with a few locals sat watching . A waitress tells you where to sit even though it's a pub, drinks are a bit pricey, not much atmosphere for an Irish bar
4
Stopped over for late night drinks as it was close to the Rendezvous Hotel where we were staying. The service was great even though were there at around midnight and the bar closed as 1:30am. Definitely suggest it, especially if you are a football fan with all the associated paraphernalia.
1
Earlier in the evening we'd experienced a master class in customer service at the Long Bar.After a superb time there, we had a pleasant stroll in the balmy air and ended up at Molly Roffeys - what a difference!I was the most Irish thing in there (and I'm Welsh!) The waitress tore herself away from her mobile phone long enough to ask what we wanted. She then relayed our requests to the bartender, who then managed to leave their laptop long enough to prepare the drinks - both immediately returned to their electronic devices, while we 'enjoyed' our expensive, barely cool, quite flat lagers - we drank up and left.
2
Went to Molly Roffeys near Dorset hotel on new bridge rd. have to say food was overpriced $18 for a burger with a processed meat patty, all our meals were very poor for $$$, do yourself a favour and give it a miss.
3
If your on holidays and the European or world cups on your set. Good atmosphere, but $17 SGD for a pint of Kilkenny is day light robbery! Be prepared to lay down a serious amount of dollars for a big knees up.........
1
The service was very poor staff didn't care and the food was rubbish don't try it
I agree with other comments fake Irish bar
2
The over-priced food was less than mediocre. And the Guinness was ice cold (which is not a good thing). Give this place a miss.
3
Nothing terribly special here. Food is OK - drinks same as any pub of this genre really.Alcohol prices in Singapore tend to dampen the experience, but still had a Guinness even at $17 pint.
Enjoyable but nothing special.
2
Service is friendly, atmosphere is nice. Beer selection is limited and overpriced. Food is really not all that good. Best to skip this one.
1
Went in for a quick bite. Definitely not an Irish bar for a start. Food was nice but well overpriced as was the drink. The only good thing was there was this little band called suave who were fantastic. But the whole experience was soured by the staff. The waitresses were bad at there job. Horrible attitudes and really hard to get their attention. Dumped the food in front of us and reached over an he top of me to lift my boyfriends plate when I hadn't even finished eating. Felt really unwelcomed and rushed out the door. Not one of them cracked or made any sort of communication with us at all
2
Enticed by a footpath sign for a 3 course dinner for around $19 plus glass of wine for 'only $7.90' my wife and I were hooked. But not for long. We craved for good old fashioned fish and chips which was one of the meal deal choices. The waitress wanted $13 for a glass of wine so I had to take her outside and show her the $7.90 one on the footpath sign. That established, a band struck up. With awful acoustics and in a confined space that stopped any further ability to talk. The mushroom soup (the best part of the meal) was delivered at the same time as the fish and chips, so the main dish was able to get cold while the soup was eaten. The 'fish' was simply the worst piece of some kind of glutinous medium coated with excessive and oily batter. Dessert next, a cubic inch of some kind of chocolate iced cake. The worst meal, venue and service that we got in Singapore. Wish we had read the general revues of this place BEFORE we got hooked by the footpath sign. A place to avoid, and there is simply no room here for management to come up with any valid excuses or spin on this one
1
The place was almost empty but service was so slow we almost walked away after 30 minutes waiting. Drinks came out slowly, one by one, in a different way they were ordered by our group of 5. Drinks tasted very watery as though very little alcohol was even present. Challenged to explain the long wait, we were just given the excuse that two outside tables had ordered food. No apology, no sense of caring. If this is one of the newer bars to open, I hope it is one of the next to close. There are great views of the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay Sands Hotel from outside this bar - just find a different one to drink at!
2
Liked the ambience but that's about all, meal rushed far to quickly couldn't wait to get us out of the place entree and main course camei out the same timeDid not like anything entree and main course came out same time, bill delivered before we had even finished eating,rushed out of there pretty quickly, staff grumpy and not pleasant
1
as all drinks in singapore it was over priced, service was ok but I warn u stay away from the food. there are some awesome places to eat in singapore and this is not ine of them. I
1
This is a very tired place
Food and service we'll below my expectations. Looked forward to enjoying a British type meal
Look elsewhere very little to commend it
4
Nice pub, not a dive at all. Live bands. Technically its a mix of Irish and British but that's ok, you're on the other side of the world.
1
Went to the Bras Basah outlet for late lunch earlier today. They used to have an outlet near my office and they have a decent lunch set menu. I especially like their fish & chips. Unfortunately, this outlet has a very bad service. This was unacceptable considering the pub was pretty much empty at that time. When I called the waitress to ask for more sauce, she refused to walk over to my table so I had to shout out. When I asked for the bill, the waitress curtly told me to pay at the cashier. I could still accept this, if not for the fact that when I just came in, I saw her bringing bill to another table. I'd rather go to hawker center and have no service (and pay less) than having this kind of atrocious service

I was here to watch a couple of world cup games in June while staying at the Rendezvous hotel nearby. Their prices were expensive and the serve size for food very very very small. Overall ambience is also ok, unless you are an Arsenal supporter :) Best avoided in my view

I went to Molly Roffy's with a colleague this evening. The beers we had were good, though expensive. The conversation with the 2 bar staff was good. The pub is in a good location and had a good feel to it. However, we were offered a couple of shots at the bar. "Why don't you join us too" was our response to the bar staff, thinking that they were simply rewarding loyal customers spending at the bar with a fee shot each (as has happened to us lots of time in other locations worldwide) No mention of the cost of the shots was made. After some more beers, the same thing happened. At the end of the evening, $SG 128 appeared on the bill. We queried why it was there, and was told it was for 2 rounds of 4 shots at $SG 16 each. If we'd known of the price, we wouldn't have done such an expensive thing in the first place, but we weren't told of the additional price by Abby and Kat, the barmaids. On questioning the bill, they told us tthat one something had been rung through the cash register, they could not remove it and would be liable if it wash't paid, so if we didn't pay, they would have to pay the outstanding amount themselves. So we paid and left, feeling disgruntled and ripped-off. Whether it's a policy of the pub to to do this, or we were just naive and got caught in a scam, I can't say, but we're $ SG 128 out of pocket as a result.  Lessons learnt: 1: Don't accept shots in this pub that you think are free simply because nobody has told you how much they cost. check first before putting anything to your lips! 2: Don't come to this pub for a reasonably priced beer. There are plenty of more reasonably pubs in Singapore. For example, I paid $ SG 9.50 for a pint of a really nice Pale Ale at LeVel33 in Singapore the previous night. Erdinger in Molly Roffey's was $ SG 18.50! Google LeVel33 to see the sort of establishment it is

Brought in a group of 7 people. Band playing good fun, but of course football stops music, if we had known this then we would have chosen somewhere else. Are you a pub or a supporters club?Food had to be rush ordered as kitchen was closing, showing football and not providing food so strange for late matches.After spending $300+, I asked for glass of water for my wife - REFUSED - not allowed! have to buy bottle. Please let me know why would I ever want to go there again? Why do bosses make very stupid decisions and then leave your floor staff to have to manage the customer

Molly Roffey's might be a good spot if Arsenal is playing, but it's an average pub at best. Five beers on tap; they'll make a Black and Tan from Guinness and Kilkenny. The fish and chips was good-- snapper. They had an indifferent folk band--I'm being generous here--and opted to substitute quantity for quality by cranking the volume up. The place is small, and if such a thing were possible they would have been better off muffling the music. I didn't waste much time clearing out.

We had an early dinner here last Sunday (27 April, 2014) after visiting Singapore Art Musuem and National Museum.To summarize our experience:Pro:- Atmosphere is great! They have a dim light. So it is quiet relaxing for us. Though, some may not like it but for us, it didn't bother us.- Food: we finished everything! It means, we enjoyed our early dinner. We are happy that we have tried their Best Sellers - see pictures. Loved Ginger Ole (softdrinks) for $6!- Location: Near Bras Basah MRT, in between of Kopitiam and a Coffee Shop (Manulife Building).- Wifi connection is awesome! Two thumbs for this!- Waitress: friendly and accommodating. They deserve a good tip.Con:-Expensive. But hey, once in awhile, it's ok to splurge and it's worth it!Overall, we will definitely come back again! Will bring my whole family next time. :

Will just review this as to how we found it on the night - different nights maybe have different theme To get in we had to pay a cover charge - cost of the first drink which was then served free. Guinness in a plastic soft tumbler - pants - and wouldn't even change for glass when asked It was the night for an Arsenal game so every inch of wall was covered with Arsenal memorabilia - not that irish - most tables were empty but held reserved signs, bar staff miserable and unhelpful…had to have at least one drink as I had to pay to get in …Guinness was pants…nearly left itAnd as a note this was at 7 pm - never agai

If you want a nice pint of Guinness in Singapore, this is the place to come. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Never realised reviews has to be 100 characters long....

Very good service from the staff when we went for dinner and a drink after a busy days work sadly the food was not to the same standard as the staff service. The food was only Luke warm, small portions and not the best quality

A great place to eat and drink. Food is very tasty and service is prompt. The staff are all very friendly and for the Rugby fans, plenty of action on the TV

We had a drink and some food here after a tiring day roaming around town. Nice menu and good value for money. They had a good combo meal option too but we were not so hungry. Nice way to spend an evening with friends

Visited the newly opened outlet at Dorsett Residence.I was attracted to the lunch deal! $12.80/$15.80 nett for a drink, soup and main course is a pretty good deal especially in town! Love the potato and leek soup. The steak was good and aglio olio comes with generous portion of prawns too. Will visit again if I am around the area. A nice place for gathering as well

I stopped over at Molly Roffey's for some Kilkenny's draught this evening. It's a regular, decent Irish pub. Friendly staff, decent service and good beer. The ambiance is nice, that of a traditional Irish pub. They have TV sets put up, as expected to watch soccer matches. The English Premier League is quite popular here.The pub is centrally located on Bras Basah road next to the Singapore Art Museum

There can't be many places in Singapore were you can get a three course (European style) meal for under $20 but this is one of them. It has to be said we are talking pub food here, but it was fine, a tasty mushroom soup, well cooked sirloin steak and a very sweet chocolate cake. Couple that with a half decent pint of Kilkenny, a live band, and you have the makings of a different type of night out in Singapore

We had lunch at this pub recently. For $10.80 Singapore we had the lunch special.The deal included soup.. delicious potato and leek and then there were several choices for the main course. A drink was included.We enjoyed our meal. Service was good and we felt it was good value for money

What a great place , and so near to the Rendezvous Hotel. If you don't want to drink Tiger beer all the time whilst in Singapore , call in at Molly Roffey's and have a pint of Guinness or Kilkenney beer --- the food on offer is good too

Seriously this is a fun place. The waitresses are in a league of their own whre they go one step futther and creat and atmosphere in the place. I was there Friday and Saturday night. Anam and Band was playing so 'Golden oldies' and they were old time rockers who could certainly demonstrate that they are polished musicians. Food was great and of a Western/Irish pursuasion. Drinks were at Western prices which was the only negative. Are some younger people there so worth a look
