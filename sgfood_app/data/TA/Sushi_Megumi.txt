We are lucky to have such world class excellent sushi on Sentosa, but ouch! It's expensive. 448 sing $ for two for the works plus one bottle of saki. It's good, but not for the faint of heart.

Superfresh, high quality sashimi and sushi presented in classic style with emphasis on quality and presentation. Chef Kondo has exquisite cutting techniques. If you, like me, have had it up to here with fusion tampering, this restaurant is an oasis

I had sardines before but never the ones at Megumi prepared by Kondo-San. Never knew fresh raw sardines could taste so good with just a little ginger and chives added on. The sushi and sashimi I had was also delicious. If you have the time, make your way there for lunch or dinner. No regards..
