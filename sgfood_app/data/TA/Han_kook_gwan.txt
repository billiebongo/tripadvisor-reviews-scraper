This is great place for excellent Korean BBQ. There are several Korean restaurants in this area, however, we really enjoyed the food and great service at this restaurant. Also good value for money.

It's Sunday around 11.30pm and we were starving around Tanjong Pagar. Luckily this restaurant is opened and not bad!Two of us ordered quite a lot of food! Topoki, seafood pajeon, and buddaejige!!All foods are good! Price is slightly expensive but pretty good portion served.

My family and I visited Han Kook Gwan on a Saturday night for dinner. We ordered the BBQ set comprising of 3 types of meat, a steamed egg and a bowl of rice ($98). Unfortunately, the portion was not very generous but in fairness, the quality of meat was quite good. The soft tofu soup ($15) was quite a let down as with the seafood pancake. Perhaps it was a Sat night, there was obviously a shortage of serving staff. In summary, unless you have a special reason to eat there, I would suggest you take a stroll down Tanjong Pagar Rd for better quality and price.

Went to han kook gwan for their famous cold crab "Gejang". The crab was fresh but the taste wasn't what I expected, not really to my liking and the sauce was a bit too sweet. Ordered the crab for $53 and it came with choice of kimchi or bean paste soup and a bowl of steam egg. In the end, I ordered another pork belly because I really did not enjoy the crab at all. Not their fault but as a warning, know what you expect before ordering their cold crab.

The food here at Han Kook Gwan was really amazing!! The restaurant was on channel 8 a few months ago and so I decided to give it a try ... I loved the food!! The restaurant provides amazing authentic side dishes based from My experience in Korea , the â€œkalbi" is beef and it was so fresh and the way that the food was cooked by the assistant was amazing! The seafood pancake also contained a good amount of seafood and so was the kimchi pancake !!! I loved it and I would love to vist this restaurant again!!!

There was this TV program on Singapore's channel 8 recently on their cold crabs and hence, I decided to give it a try with some mates.The cold crab is really yummy! don't fret out on the rawness...cos the sweetness and rich flavour of the roe with the soy sauce is pretty much an almost perfect match! Meat's soft and give it a bite and you can suck the meat off the crab's body pretty easily! The only thing is that it's a tad too salty for me and my mates, oh well, still nice. Pls remember to mix the roe with the sauce and add 'em into the white rice. Best. All raw crabs order came together with a portion of soup, so we could choose between kimchi soup, beanpaste toufu soup or beancurd soup. We ordered the unmarinated pork belly and also the marinated US prime beef (without bones). The beef was much preferred as it's soft and juicy and marinated meat is fragrant with every bite. However the pork belly was disappointing as the meat was kinda tough, not sure if it was overcooked by the assistant who helped us with the cooking. We ordered the Pa Jeon (seafood pancake) and it wasn't very fantastic. It tasted bland and it lacks the crisp nor the fried fragance at the sides and I don't remmeber seeing alot of seafood in it. We were looking high and low for the seafood pancake sauce and found out that it was one of the 3-sauces saucer served individually (if we din't ask, we would'nt have known) There's a good variety of side dishes give, sizzling steam egg, kimchi, seaweed, brocoli, onions etc, but most of the side dishes, frankly were disappointing, as they all tasted a little bland to us too. I would say the food's here is ok, not really my favourite, but definitely won't mind coming back for the cold crabs (pls call to reserve before hand, costs around 43 SGD each with the soup in tow) and also the marinated beef. :

Decided to try this korean restaurant since well known for their BBQ. When we reached there, the boss (i assume, a polite Korean gentleman) asked us to wait a while while they cleaned up the table since we have not made reservation.We ordered the pork & chicken bbq and saw a few customers eating the raw cold crab which was not in the menu. My husand & I ordered a plate of that and we never regretted!! It was awesome and the bbq dishes was fantastic too.The servers were very helpful and my daughter had a complimentary bowl of steam egg too.After the meal, we were served cold barley drink which tasted so nice.We will definitely go back again for bbq korean as it is the best so far we have tried and reasonably priced

The food is authentic and tastes great, but a little pricey. Try to book in advance and asks for the red bean rice, which needs to be ordered in advance as they do not prepare it on regular basis. The makgoli is very nice and addictive and goes well with the food - it is smooth and does not really make me drunk but gives me a good night's sleep. My fave menu items are the samkyeopsal, the pajeon and the stirfried nakjim. If you order any of the chigaes or spicy stews, be sure to ask for the korean dried noodles - they have a very nice springy texture compared to your usual instant noodles
