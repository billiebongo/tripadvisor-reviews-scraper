I literally love the food here especially the tauhu gorend aka friend bean curd. Unlike others that pre fry the beancurd and overdose on the prawn paste, it prepares it from scratch and smoulders the beancurd with a unique paste that's addictive. Writing about it makes me want to go back to it now

This plate of 2 meat and 1 veggie costs $7.50. Quite reasonable pricing given that the shop is located in a mall.I had the chicken merah, chilli sotong and sayar lodeh which was a little too spicy for me. Overall, it was a good and satisfying meal

Rumah Sayang is located in the basement of the JEM. It is an air con coffee shop serving a wide variety of Malay food.They offer nasi padang with a wide selection of food to choose from. The food is freshly prepared and cooked, so it is hot.The SGD 20 curry fish head set with tofu goreng and rice is a real good deal.Additionally, they also offer other local favorites like serve roti prata, curry laksa, mee rebus, etc.This is a good place for those who wants different kinds of Malay Food as there are many choices to choice from.The price is reasonable and the the portion is good for sharing
