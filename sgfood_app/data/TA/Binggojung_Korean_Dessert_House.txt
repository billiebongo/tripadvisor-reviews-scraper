If you want the authentic Korean desert to savour , this has to be the place to come. Look out for the promotional items because they are irresistible.

The serving is huge and tastes great. The waffles is unique unlike the traditional western waffles. It is also a great place to chill out with friends too.

I went to the outlet at Bukit Timah Plaza. The Injeolmi Bingsu was so soft that it melted my heart. Mochi was chewy amidst an abundance of sliced almonds. I also had a matcha ice cream to paired along.

Visited this place again and this time tried 2 other flavours of bingsu. Both tasted as good esp. the one with green tea and red bean. This is a really good place to chill and had a chit chat session with loved ones or with friends

I went with my hubby & brother on a Saturday afternoon and the place was not crowded. However, it is a small place. The bingsu is not cheap but quite nice. I ordered the traditional injeolmi bingsu at S$12. It's a big bowl of ice. The men ordered chewy waffles at S$5 and they are really chewy. Free wifi available. HDB parking available nearby. Nice place for couples who love desserts

Needless to say, this is one of my favourite hangouts around the Bukit Timah area. The cafe is pretty small and is pretty crowded at night. Tried most of their bingsu, personally still prefer the Injeolmi bingsu. Had the red bean one this time, which was not bad either.

Bingojung occupies a small corner of the popular Korean DIY table BBQ restaurant Ju Shin Jung. Ju Shin Jung diners can produce the restaurant's receipts to get 10% off their bingsu on the same day. Bingojung offers shaved ice classics such as injeolmi bingsu with soya sand and chewy chunks of Korean rice cakes, patbingsu with red bean purée, and matcha bingsu dusted with imported, powdered green tea and a scoop of matcha ice cream. The cafe is small and seats fill up quickly. I prefer the non traditional versions of the shaved iced dessert such as the banana and brownie bingsu. There's also bingsu with crumbled cheese crackers and chunks of cheesecake to cater to customers who prefer their bingsu less sweet. Besides their signature bingsu, the cafe also serves excellent coffee and smoothies, with free wifi thrown in.A little off the beaten track, Bingojung is worth a detour as their Korean shaved iced desserts are authentic and wholesome; the boss is also very generous with the ingredients and toppings. While the bingsu from other cafés cost more, and their servings are for only one or two person/s, the huge bowls of bingsu at Bingojung can each serve up to four persons. Bingojung's bingsu are priced between SGD11-13 per bowl (less than USD10 per bowl)

This Korean dessert cafe is located next to Ju Shin Jung Korean BBQ restaurant.It is a draw to the many fans of Korean shaved ice desserts.Bingsu is like the local ice kachang but served Korean style.We ordered the Injeolmi Bingsu, which is the cafe's specialty.This is a bowl of finely shaved ice topped with rice cake, soya bean powder, almond flakes and condensed milk. We also had the Milk and Red Bean Pat Bingsu, which is shaved ice topped with red bean, corn flakes, rice cake and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.The order of 2 Bingsu comes with a complimentary INJEOLMI toast which is a toast sandwiched with thin blobs of Korean rice cake and topped with condensed milk. A bit too sweet for my taste.There are other items like waffles and sandwich toasts served in this cafe.Each bingsu costs around SGD $10.This is the place to go if you miss Korean desserts. A bit expensive if you compare to the local ice kachang, but worth to try at least once
