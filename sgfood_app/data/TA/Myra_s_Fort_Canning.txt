Good food but ambience and service could be better. There seemed to be too little service staff around.

Had dinner with a group here recently. Food was fantastic - fresh and delicious flavours. Staff were helpful and friendly. One minor issue is with finding the restaurant. There was no signage within Fort Canning that we could see at night and we drove around a bit in order to find it (located bottom level of a building).
