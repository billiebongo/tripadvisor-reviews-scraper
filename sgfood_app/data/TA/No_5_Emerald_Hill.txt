Just up from Orchard Road, this place is quite charming. There are two sides to it. We went into the cocktail bar. Had a bear and a wine with some bar snacks. Nice atmosphere and the service was very good.

Just next to expensive Orchard Road lies Emerald Hill. Very beautiful little Street with warm atmosphere compared to the busy Orchard Road
And the beers are Good

I walways go here at least once everytime I am in Singapore . Friday night was packed so went back Sat for lunch . Just a great bar , it has atmosphere .

Fantastic music, food and beverages offered. Location is prime for this fantastic bar. Rain and Dennis who's always behind the bar provides exceptional service and superb recommendations!!

Their signature fried chicken wings is a must try. Don’t be surprised if you see people throw the peanut shell on the ground. (Singapore is a strict policy on littering)Advanced booking is recommended. You can play snooker on the first floor. French fries is also must try menu
4
This is one of my favourite hang outs in Singapore.Colourful and atmosphere to boot.It’s always lively and full and offers a great pub menu with loads of options for the thirsty traveler.Try out the No 5 pizza or the chicken wings! Just off Orchard road.Go on and visit it! Have a blast!

This is a great place by Orchard rd to grab some really cheap martinis. They also give you complimentary peanuts, which they encourage you to eat and toss the shells on the floor. Other than that, the drinks are average, and the staff impossible to wave down. They're too busy chatting to themselves

We returned to No. 5 Emerald Hill to celebrate a special anniversary, and perhaps memory tinges the past with a rosy light. Certainly, the ambiance sitting outside on the patio in the serene Emerald Hill neighborhood invites you to relax with a drink and a bite--and that has not changed in five years. What did change was the quality of my Earl Grey martini, which I recall being far more fragrant than what I was served. Our fish balls appetizer was fine, just a little toothy, and of course, the service was fine as well. Not a bad place to enjoy the scenery, but you pay a bit for it, unfortunately

I've had some pretty decent nights at no 5. Great setting, affordable martinis and good food. But it's almost always been plagued by bad service. Once could be marked off as a bad day, every visit though? My final experience had me receiving wrong orders, barely getting service after several tries, a bill more than twice the amount of what I ordered and barely even an apology. They messed up my bill and suddenly there were items on it that I didn't order. The waiter and waitresses kept pushing the blame around to each other. I literally repeated my order 4 times after having written down exactly what I ordered because clearly nobody was getting anything done right. Waited more than half an hour for them to rectify the situation, for which I was late for another engagement. All of that down, all I got was one sorry and my final bill. No attempts to explain or at least try and appease.I'm not saying don't go here. I'm sure others have had it better. But I'll stick to places where service is good and the staff are sincere.No.5 emerald hill. Goodbye and good riddance.

I went here on a Friday night with my friends to have some drinks because I read about this bar on the internet. Quite funky and good list of cocktail HOWEVER I have never been to any bar with this bad service and almost all their staff were rude. A waiter asked us for our order and my friend ordered her apple martinis and then another friend said we already ordered so just get her apple martinis. The guy misheard it and they served us 2 orders insisting we ordered it. We tried to explain that he misheard our order and we were not gonna pay for it. He gave us a look and said that we were wrong because we're drunk (we weren't by the way but because it's Friday night they assume everyone is). I told them that we weren't paying for their mistake, plus he was being rude and the customer service is terrible. He then said "The customer is NOT always right!" and walked away. This bar tends to be packed because of their $20 for 2 martinis and happy hour but we are never coming back. Please don't waste your time. I would recommend the next door place Ice Cold Beer or Alley Bar or Loof. Better service and you'll probably have a better time. This experience frankly ruined a bit of our evening. So advice to everyone, skip this place and go somewhere else. The drinks were normal drinks and not that special anyway
4
It's very interesting place where we can sit outside the bar and drink till 10:45 pm. People are very nice and so do the drinks are good but it kinda expensive. Overall I love the place and there are plenty of bars around too...
5
Lovely atmosphere and yummy cocktails. The finger food wasn't too good, but the awesome cocktails make up for it. Would definitely go here again
5
great staff, awesome vibe amazing bartenders and a small gem in a nice Emerald Hill quarter. Cool music and great veggie pizza
3
Certainly a lot more cost effective compared to other joints when it comes to alcoholic beverages yet the martinis tend to be a tad wishy-washy!
3
I should have opted for the martinis. The beers are ridiculously expensive: $19 for an Asahi Black! We moved to the bar at #9 where you get 3 beers for $25: much better value.
5
Just off the madness of Orchard Road - No. 5 is tucked back in an alley and is like stepping back in time. It's generally crowded in the evening, but makes a great afternoon beer stop. Awesome ambience - it's in an old row shop, narrow, high ceilings and long. The staff is always friendly and they usually have a really good beer on tap
2
The very first time I came to Singapore, 20 years ago, this was the first bar I was guided to and it was indeed a great bar. When I moved here 7 years later, I used to frequent this place on and off, and it was still good.Perhaps we caught it on an off night but the place was not that busy, a fair number of people but nowhere near heaving as it has been in the past.The service was dreadful, it took 10 minutes to attract some attention, we ordered and another 10 minutes elapsed, and one of the two ordered drinks appeared, 5 minutes later the second beer arrived.We had a number of rounds and each time it took 15 - 20 minutes to get the drinks which is just not good enough.We split some pizzas - decent enough and reasonably priced - but by the end we were getting pretty cheesed off by the service and paid up and went elsewhere. I am not sure I will try it again
4
Amazing chicken wings and fries!Great range of alcoholic beverages and the bar counter is cool.Throwing peanut shells on the floor is something unique.Smoking area a little tight but still acceptable. Price is a bit steep. But overall experience was great.Recommended to chill out there often on evenings for drinks and chat with your friends
5
Definitely a good value for money with attractive prices during happy hours till 9pm and the 1+1 martini offer post that. The staff is quite friendly and service is great. However, we would have been happier if there were more options for food and the chairs were a bit more comfortable. Overall a nice cocktail bar that we would like to visit again
5
A lovely cocktail bar in Downtown core. The staff are extremely friendly. The prices, however, are not so friendly. A cocktail costs around 14-18 Singaporean dollar, which is even higher priced than Denmark, which is already an expensive country regarding alcohol. Other than that, a great place for cocktail lovers
4
Love their matinis which cost only $10nett each (1set for $20).
Monday have 1 for 1 draught beers too.
free flow of peanuts.
Interesting decos and good ambience for relaxing
4
Love the decor & laid back vibe. Great music (think Mambo/Zouk old school). Can get a little noisy. Martinis at $20 for 2 from 9pm onwards. They aren't super strong but great to drink & chill out to.
4
Came here this week to try the $10 martinis after 9pm. The place was pretty crowded and there was generally a good atmosphere. Service was efficient and the selection of martinis extensive. Good value and worth another visit.
5
The beer prices here have risen quite a lot, even during happy hours but the Gin, Vodka, Bourbon and other hour pours are still excellently priced during happy hour. The Samosas are the best thing on the menu and I had them a couple of times at least
4
In Singapore, where a standard 30ml house pour of off the shelf alcohol can cost you anywhere between 12++ and 16++, this place is a gem. For 8 bucks NET for a 45ml pour, you get premium house pours like Bombay for gin. The Gin and Tonics are well made, yummy for whole day drinks (they open at 12) on the outdoor deck. If you don't drink spirits, don't worry there's also a few beers on tap (Kronenberg and an ale - I can't remember which) at a decent happy hour price. In the daytime, Denis the bartender provides excellent service and always remembers your order. On the other hand, the food is not that cheap (about 20 bucks net for most substantial items), but well worth it. If you want to eat - and you will - try the full or half (you'll regret getting a half) portion of chicken wings, onion rings (the batter is deliciously crunchy), mini burgers (you get 3), and salami and capers pizza. In that order. Happy hour ends at 9pm. After that there are the yummy Martinis - 2 for $16 NET (or is it 17?). Stay for those! And go home happy.No5 is my happy place. :
4
The location of the joint is very convenient, just opposite Sommerset MRT and also the bus stop nearby serves almost every location in Singapore. The ambience reminds me of Lan Kwai Fong in Hong Kong. Drinks are decent shares but quite strong and good. The martinis are good and also very authentic. Price are reasonable too
4
On a random Tuesday, a friend and I, decided to take a random stroll in Somerset at 5 pm. We stumbled across No. 5 Emerald Hill and bulls eye. It is quaint yet rustic - I remember this building from when I was kid. It was just a hostel rustically decorated as a trendy Singapore bar. It looks and smells like a bar. So seating outside is always a good option. However if you choose to sit inside pick the high stools.We enjoyed the buy-one-get-one Martini offer. I would recommend Mango Martini and definitely order the Chicken Wings. The combination is a match made in Emerald hill
4
As most of the other reviewers commented this place does 2 for 1 martinis most of the night. Contrary to the other reviews my martini was very well made, extremely dry and plenty strong enough. In Singapore, to get a beer for $10 is good work, a decent martini at this price is worth the trip. You can also pretend you're in Raffles Hotel/any other country where dropping litter is ok and throw your peanut shells on the floor. I'd say this is overrated but I think that this bit of rubbish rebellion actually makes this bar one of the more fun places I've been to so far. People dancing like loons and spirits flowing free on a Wed night, this was a good place for a quiet drink but could have been a wild party.
4
No 5 bar is a excellent place to relax and chill with your friends. A worthy place to munch on peanuts and feel free to just litter them on the floor. Try their signature chicken wings. It's crispy outside and tender inside. Located just along somerset.
4
My Singaporeans took me here for the first time and I love it. Great location, you can see the development of Singapore with giant buildings and lightning at the back and upon the hill there are small, old looking buildings. The drink here is v good, I really enjoy the martinis! They do happy hours by one get one free too. The fried chicken wings is yum, nice lovely No. 5 giant glass of martini and free peanuts
4
Lots of choices for cocktails buy 1 and get 2. Tasty and Strong in alcohol.
Services always slow here.

Summary: All staff must be briefed clearly on the day's event (if any) and treat all customers with respect. Details as follow:Very bad planning of Ricola event! We were called in for some lucky draw and they pestered my bf for the number of guests attending a few times (3 times to be exact) during the work day. They also said that there would be a free drink for all guests. Ok it seemed like a good start to a mid week work day and chill out with friends even if we did not win any lucky draw. Upon arrival, there was no registration for participants and guests for the event. It was puzzling. The staff just mentioned that it was free seating on the 1st floor. I told her we were here for the event but she still insisted that we just wait around. We had no seats or table reserved for us. We accepted it and waited for an available table as it was fully packed and a side bar table with other customers was all that's left. We had to share and stand around to eat and drink. After waiting for a while, a table was freed up so we decided to move in. A waitress named MARICAR, hurriedly moved in and told us that it was reserved for the participants of the Ricola event. Ok, so we told her that we were the participants. She still kept insisting that it was only for the participants even after what I had told her. So she finally heard us and my bf went with her to register his attendance. He came back with the drink coupons and said that another waitress, Gina, told us to sit there. We happily moved to that available table.Just a few minutes of warming the seat, the waitress, MARICAR, came over to tell us and Gina that we could not sit there again! She insisted it was reserved for Ricola STAFF! (Staff should not tell off each other in front of customers). She should have made it clearer in the very first place that it was for the staff! Feeling very frustrated of this, we told her we will move when the staff arrive. That MARICAR left with a "black" face. Gina was very kind to tell us to just sit there first as she could tell that this was such a messy situation on their end. A while later, Maricar came back with our drinks and the bill. She gave this stinking attitude by slamming the drinks on the table. How rude of her! It was the last straw. We decided to move out of the table to avoid causing any more conflict. After an hour, the table was still empty.............. The staff only arrive an hour and a half later. Another matter, I wanted to order from the list of available cocktails on the menu. But the waiter wasn't sure of what I could order even after showing him the Ricola event drinks coupon. This just further highlights that not all staff are aware of how this event was being run and that they were not briefed prior to the start of it. The waiter returned and said that we could only order the Ricola Cranberry! That's frustrating... They should have been more specific. The coupon was printed with the words "Ricola Cocktail". Overall, my group of friends and I did not enjoy paying for the bad service. It was a very unpleasant time at No. 5 @ Emerald Hill due to their LACK OF excellent service. The management should look carefully into training and preparing your staff adequately in order to provide excellent service

This place is so consistency for made a perfect cocktails. It doesn't matter which floor I ordered ground or second floors. Both bartender were just Excellent. We went in for late drink after midnight on Thursday. The bartender on the ground floor recommended me to try cocktails name "Do not prepare" which he stated as a sweet and sour taste with refreshing. I'm glad I tried it. It was so good and end up got 4 glasses of it. The service was attentive as usual. Definitely will keep coming back to this place and brought my friends over here too.

Visited this place for the first time not for a drink, but was accompanying a couple for their wedding photoshoot. Was impressed with the place decor at first and got interested to visit it next time for a drink. It quickly turned into a nightmare for all of us.The couple initially booked the place for a photoshoot from 2-4 pm at a rate of S$250. We understood that we came really late at close to 4pm, because we were held up by the rushing of shoots from other locations. Tried to ask the bartender to talk to the lady manager/owner (I'm not sure) if we could play by ear and have our photoshoot as long as we're not disturbing other guests. She said no. Even though we were informed that guests only start strolling in from 5pm.The groom asked the bartender to call her again and spoke with her personally asking for this favour. She gave us 15 minutes. Which was ridiculous, and we still have to pay the full S$250. Yet the place was still empty.We rushed the shoot within 20 minutes with constant side glares from the bartender, and went next door (Que Pasa) to continue the shoot, with a rather drastic difference in service quality by the staffs. They even gave us complimentary cold water to freshen up. Though I was informed by the groom that the place actually belonged to the same owner.A fresh example of a successful and busy business, but has become too cocky and inflexible towards service. The fact that no guests was around yet made it even worse. And paying a hefty sum for a 15 minutes session that was still open for public.Well done and thanks for ruining a wedding couple's day

They have better pricing for drinks than other bars in Singapore. Beer is a little expensive but cocktails and spirits are competitively priced for the amount served. I ordered a glass of Glenlivet scotch at $15 SGD.While I understand the peanut shells are part of its appeal, they do make the place seedy and dirty. Service is indeed appalling; took them a while to give me a menu then took them yet more time to come back and get my order, despite me just sitting on the bar.What really left a bad taste in the mouth was being handed the bill a couple of minutes after my drink was served. They should stop doing that as it discourages customers from staying longer and ordering more drinks, which is exactly what happened with me
1
Sat down at the bar on a Monday night, waited for 10 minutes as waiter after waiter walked past. Finally decided to approach one that had his face buried in his phone, he didn't even look at me and gestured for one of his colleagues to get me a menu.Ordered one and got two instead, apparently it was a two for one night for $19 even though I wanted only one. Both tasted pretty good but was drastically weak. The bill came for $25! Turns out I ordered a 'premium' martini.Beautiful building with ignorant, unfriendly staff. Go next door

Emerald Hill is a small cut, off the side of Orchard Road, right next to Singapores largest and most famous shopping hub. But despite it's location, it still holds on to that traditional old shop house style so readily identified with the early part of the last century. This small street of bars and diners contains a few gems, and one such is No. 5.A great space that draws an entertaining, mixed and unpretentious crowd, clearly out to have a good time, particularly on a Saturday night, with the addition of a pool table tucked out of the way upstairs. Good service with generous happy hours
4
After Mexican dinner, our group of 6 peoples moved to this place which considered as our comfort bar in Singapore. We ordered ;A. Watermelon Martini was quite good.. Little too sweet maybe. B. Lygee Martini was order twice (2 *2=4 glass in total) my girlfriend was very happy with it. C. Passion fruit Martini was bitter and sour which made its excellent to me. D. No. 5 Gin Martini was also ordered twice by my hubby who's definitely in loved. E. A few pint of beers and one bottle of Asahi. No complaint about it. The service was attentive as usual by Filipino lady. No GSt or Service charge add to the bills. We were happy to gave extra tip on each bills. It was super crowded as usual on Friday night. Floor full of shells nut (complimentary roasted nut to each table and the shells ended up on the floor. It mad the place look a bit dirty. It would be nicer if they also provides an empty bowl for litter.) Martini 2 glass for 19$S was a steal deal. We'll continue support this place.

Emerald Hill offers a fantastic opportunity to see and experience how Singapore once looked. The old houses have been beautifully preserved, and offer a complete contrast to the modernity of Orchid Road.No. 5 is a super looking bar/restaurant. There is a range of drinks. The wine was reasonable but the beer prices were at the higher end of the Singapore price scale. We also had the prawn pizza and chicken wings. Whilst the pizza was great the chicken was extremely average.Still a good place to stop and experience the old and the new Singapore coming together
5
I sincerely appreciate and am extremely grateful for the work, time and effort Mr. Kelvin put into making sure my time there was enjoyable. His charismatic character and friendly disposition towards his customers instantly makes him approachable. This allows a me to feel welcomed.Kelvin does not hesitate to go the extra mile for his customers, serving them with dedication and care. I believe this is very important in providing first-class service which I have experienced in Singapore. He is a fine asset to No.5 and Customer Service Industry in Singapore and I believe that his performance will continue to impress clients. Thanks for making my experience so enjoyable
4
A bit expensive (15-20$ for a beer, more than 20 for other drinks), but a really nice place to meet your friends ! Even went there for a date, was fun. A bit crowded
1
I went to No. 5 on Sun afternoon. Firstly, no one came to serve us, so I had to go to the bar to order the wine from the manager. I ordered a bottle of wine for 2 pax. Before I could even take a sip of my wine, the waiter comes out and interrupts my conversation, asking for the credit card. It was not like we were in a crowded night club or bar where it is hard to keep track of clients. We were having a bottle of wine among 2 people. I am appalled because it suggests that we are going to skip on the bill. I travel the world and am Singaporean and yet I have never been asked to pay BEFORE i finish my drink/meal in a sit down bar. Furthermore I noticed that the table next to us paid for their drinks with a credit card out of his wallet and so it is clear to me, they were not asked to give up the credit card before their drink. I have heard people say Singapore's customer service is the worst in the world and I have never thought so till now. I don't understand (a) the discrimination (b) why there is a need to pay before you finish your drink! The bottle of wine was $68 too...not cheap
3
I went here with some friends. Nice lively atmosphere and music but still able to talk. Free monkey nuts and nice atmosphere. The service however is terrible and we were waiting 25 mins for someone to come and take an order and then another 30 for it to arrive. Total disorganisation.Best avoided
2
I went there with my colleagues a few months ago, and went to the carpeted area to sit down.Within a few minutes, my colleague and I started experiencing red raised bumps and irritation on our legs where they touched the carpet (pictures included). The area was evidently extremely dirty. We asked to switch seats but were met with a rude response from one of the serving staff. There was a private event upstairs and a shortage of space, but it was handled extremely poorly and no apology was given for the state of the carpet.I love their martinis, the peanuts and one-for-one promotions but that experience was definitely bad
1
We come here usually for evening drinks, but this time around we came for Lunch. We decide to order a margherita pizza. The menu says the pizza has tomatoes and pesto. We asked the waitress Gina to make the pizza without tomato slices, we should have seen how this lunch was going when she said 'let me check if that's possible'. We specify, please make sure the pesto is still on it. She comes back with a stale, cold pizza and when we tell her the pizza has no pesto, she calls the kitchen and comes back and says "oh this menu is years old, we don't serve pesto on the margarita' I went on to ask her if the pizza is usually also served stale as well she basically looks at us and "SHRUGS HER SHOULDERS" we ask to see the manager, apparently they don't have one. She goes to speak to someone and just decides not to come back to the table. We get up and went over to the bar and paid for our beer (which btw is 12$ for a glass that is a miniature size, that I don't think can ever be used to serve beer). We told the bartender that we would not pay for the pizza we refused to eat. Instead of it being offered by them he decided to take my number so he can call his manager and they will get in touch with me later! This is by far the worst service I have ever experienced and I don't see how any of these people expect to stay in the service industry
4
The drinks were good, there was a happy hour 2 for 1 martini promotion and we tried at least 4 different types, my favourite were the choya and mango versions. The music selection was good and the staff were friendly. Nice place to sit place, nibble on peanuts and relax
4
Lovely ambience, laid back environment and good choice of martinis.. they have a good deal on martinis so check the menu before you head there. They also do tasty mutton samosas and chicken wings. a bowl of peanuts are served with every drink and the custom is to throw the peanut shells on the floor
5
This is my favourite bar in Singapore and I always try to come here whenever I'm in town. They do a 2-for-1 special on their martinis from 9pm and have an extensive list to choose from. Their signature martini is the Lychee Martini and it is YUM!
4
This place attracts the regulars who have been coming for many years. There is no better place in the heart of Orchard Road that offers inexpensive drinks and food. Each time I am here, I will go for the fried chicken. Almost every table orders this
4
Their prices are very reasonable for a pub to be located along Orchard Road. You may think with their prices their drinks will be diluted and using cheap spirits. On the contrary, they are pretty potent and they use premium spirits for their mixes. Food selection is limited to finger food but are still good enough if you are not going for a big, proper meal. But this is the place where I hang out when I am in town and adjourn somewhere else for dinner. My go to guy is Dennis who will mix you a stiff drink with a friendly smile. However, he works in the day shift and knocks off at six. So I go early for my happy hour
2
Horrible service. Unhelpful staff and rude. Go next door instead. Service is slow, food is very average and menu limited.
5
I visited No. 5 last week for the first-time and I love it! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, lovely atmosphere!
Wrote a full review about it here:

Spend most of my time drinking, but the pizza and mini sliders are pretty good food options. Great location. nice atmosphere and mostly visited by locals
4
My lastes visited on Saturday 27 June 2015. I went to this place uncountable time in past 4 yrs. The mixed drinks quality is always good which I mean right amount of alcohol in it. Mostly pubs here in Singapore tend to make very very weak drinks. But I never ever have a single problem on it. The benefits of this place is they serve a single malt Japanese Whisky
4
Very crowded, so you can understand the popularity. Due to the tradition of chucking groundnut shells on the floor, the place can get quite dirty after a while, however, the ambiance is great. Go early, stay late to avoid the crowds.They also have a pool table (paid), so it a great way to spend you time with friends. The music is also great, and a perfect volume. Loud enough to drown out the other tables, but not loud enough to drown out your friends.
4
This place has been around for so long. I've been in Singapore since 2000 and it was here back then.Best things about Number 5? Well, first is the location, just off Orchard Road opposite the Somerset MRT station. Second is the cool ambience that you get by having a bar in an old shop house. Third, the staff are all super friendly and service is first class. Fourth, they make great pizzas, and their chicken wings are world famous. And fifth, the drink prices. Their happy hour is 5pm to 9pm each day and top shelf spirits like Makers Mark, Johnny Walker Black at 45ml pours are just SGD$8 during happy hours. That's a winner for me
4
5 Emerald Hill is tucked away in a quite corner of bustling Orchard. After 8pm, you can go in and seat yourself. The decor is interesting - they have bright Chinese lanterns and everything else is wood, so one pop of colour in the midst of a lot of brown. They have an exhaustive drinks menu and their 1-1 Martinis is a really good deal. I tried the Bangkok and Passionfruit Martinis - the latter recommended by the staff. The Bangkok Martini was fabulous - layers and layers of flavour - coconut milk, lemongrass, and Chili, the predominant ones. It was like Red curry in drink form! The Passionfruit Martini was a tad strong, still good though. To eat, we had Potato Wedges - crisp on the edges and soft inside, lovely texture, and the Vegetarian Pizza - comfort food at its best, packed tight with vegetables and stretchy cheese on a thin crust.The drinks alone make this worth a visit. A good, good find
4
would have to be one of the best kept secrets in Singapore . Top value for a quite drink . Good music and a old world atmosphere just adds to the feel of the place . You can walk in for a drink and leave many hours later . It just feels right 
4
Loved their plum and lychee martinis.Unpretentious atmosphere (c'mon, throwing your peanut shells directly on the floor? :p ) Do visit during the 1-for-1 time periods.Perfect for pre-drinks/night out with your girl friends. Visited on Saturday night when it was pretty crowded. Service staff were shorthanded and not as attentive as we would have liked
4
Kind of a shanghai-dive-gone-stylish interior with a long well stocked bar. I struggled, at first, with knowing witch entrance to use as the no. 5 could also be the joint next door but that only made me ask directions (went to the wrong place first) and added to the charm. Music was good and drafts were nice, fresh and cool. Peanuts shells all over the floor. What is it the draw of that? Is it the childish joy of unlimited littering in the cleanest city in the world? A great place. I know where I'll be when the wife wants me to go shopping with her in Orchard Road
5
so far, the best bar I have been in Singapore. Fun atmoshere, unpretentious and great decor. And they can do martini, no doubt!
4
Off orchard road, tucked in a corner on the emerald hill road. Old rustic look, comfortable seating, and the best martinis in town.
4
A few steps away from the bustling Orchard Road and up a little pathway lies this 'oasis' called the Emerald Hill ! Completely sheltered from the neon lit skyline just a few feet away, this watering hole is the perfect place to unwind no matter what the day has been like. Their speciality is the variety of martinis they can concoct and if you wind you way here after 9 pm, its happy hour time time with one for one offer on their martinis! We were seaThis song was used to nice effect in the movie The Killing Fields, where a young woman with a transistor radio listens to this in the wake of a brutal US bombing of a Cambodian village when suspected rebels are being rounded up and shot. The song exemplified the contrast between the sort of druggy, frivolous Pop culture of the 1970s West and the stark realities of the Third World at the same time. (thanks, Louis - Camden, NJ)ted outdoors and to our surprise, they started taking away the furniture just before 10 pm ; apparently they had been slapped with a notice for decibel levels beyond the legal limit. As for me, I was at a loss to understand who could have complained,as the little street is only populated by these quaint bars in traditional Chinese buildings! Indoors or outdoors a great place to spend an evening 
4
I've seen the street a hundred of times but never explored it until one of my friends suggested that we go. We did not expect that inside this tiny street are shophouses (traditional Singapore houses) turned chill-out bars can be located. Personal favourite of mine is No. 5 Emerald Bar.This bar is famous for their free peanuts with shells and as you wait for your orders, you can peel the peanut and just let the shells drop on to the floor. This is the only place in Singapore that you can litter without getting a fine.IMHO, their Chicken Wings (Har Cheong Kai or Shrimp Paste Chicken) is one of the bests in the island. It is very crispy, not oily and not dry. The taste of shrimp paste is so sublte that the taste of the chicken still stands out. Their thin crust pizza is also good. The Cocktail #5 is surprisingly delicious. It's so big that you can share it with another person. It's a must have/try.The crowd of this bar is very mix, unpretentious and very hip

... plentiful and cheapslightly disappointed by the service although to be fair i think it was new staff being trained so can't really hold that against them as we all start somewhere. the martini's were excetional with a wide choice and once the staff recognised our cue were attentive and kept the martini's coming.it was quite quiet and late on when we went so lacked atmosphere but us quaint and the peanut shell floor adds to the experience. it reminded me of hemingways bar in key west, traditional and trying to remain so..

No5 starts getting packed at 9:00pm. From then onwards, all martinis are on a one-for-one offer, which means you get an additional martini for each one you buy. With a martini going for less than SGD15, it is a pretty good deal. And the martinis pack a punch too. My favourites there are the dirty martini and the choya martini. Girls opt mostly for the lychee martinis, but that's way too sweet for my palate. For those who are adventurous enough, you can try the chilli vodka shots. That's vodka with hot red chillies soaked in it for a month. Apparently a couple of dudes passed out before, after a couple of shots. Only for the bravest...or for the wasted

I shall not talk about the drinks at #5 other than to say they use good quality stuff, but can sometimes be pricey (as compared to some other outlets in the area). However, I have been going to #5 for drinks and chicken wings for quite a few years, the wings are awesome and the mini-burgers are excellent. Pizza is decent. Love the free groundnuts

All three bars in this short strip belong to one group of restaurants. Each one has its specialty -- Ice Cold Beer with beers, Que Pasa with wines and No5 with cocktails ---- but they all have one kitchen. Their alcohol is fairly priced -- lower than other place during Happy Hour. But my friends and I keep on coming back here because of their chicken wings and pizza. One of the best chicken wings here in Singapore --- lightly battered, juicy, tender and very crispy. For the pizza, the best is the Four Cheese pizza and the No5 pizza -- with a very thin and crispy crust. These are not in all the menus of the 3 bars but you can order them. BTW, if you want a more quiet place, go to Que Pasa -- Ice Cold Beer and No5 play loud music and the crowd can be loud

We were discussing the high price of drinks in Singapore with some locals, and they decided to take us to % Emerald Hill to make a point.The street is very quaint, a great escape the the bustle of Orchard. There are a few old shop houses converted to pubs on this stretch, and it's hard to choose. the atmosphere inside No.5 is relaxing, and we were lucky enough to get one of the spots where you can kick your shoes off and relax on a carpet with a few pillows.The martini's are on special all night, from 9pm-1am, two for one. You can basically get two martini's for $16

Popped inherent for a cheeky cocktail on route back to our hotel.Great range of spirits and knowledgable bar tenders. Had a couple of martinis which were a little weak but nonetheless very tasty.They have taken the idea of peanut shells on the floor from raffles and it really works. The bar itself is very old and charming
