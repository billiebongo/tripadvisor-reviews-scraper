A little hard to get to via public transport but it's a fantastic place to get work done - they have wifi and power points.
Kudos to their Nutella tart, it was extremely yummy! I especially love their cold brew and their cappuccinos :)

Free water, had a beef sw with salad and chips. Love the mustard and honey sauce. Good place for a chat and catch up. Not too noisy

I love the coffee here. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Food is not that great but dessert is good. Nice ambience. I feel at home whenever I visit Coffee Daily. Will definitely go back.

As the rainbow cake was very highly reviewed, I went there to try it out. The café itself is a cozy place with a nice ambience. The staff is relatively friendly. However, when we bought the cake worth $8.90, we were disappointed. Although it looked good on the outside, the cake was dry and hard to swallow. It had the same texture as a hard pillow. In addition, the cream did not pair well with the cake. I left such a nice-looking place feeling very disappointed. I probably won't go there again.

Came here (on a weekday afternoon) after finding this listing on TripAdvisor. Was really not disappointed.Ordered a Cinnamon Hazel drink ($6.00) - it was kinda so-so.Ordered a food item called "The Mountain" ($16.00) - it was a mixture of caramalised onion, scrambled eggs, sausage (very salty!) and toast. The toast was AMAZINGLY crunchy!Ordered a Caramel Waffle, with Vanilla ice-cream ($14.00).Total bill came to $36. There's no service charge and no GST at this cafe.The atmosphere was bright and simply. Furniture-wise it does seem the owner tried to make it kind of homely, but kinda ended up with the cafe looking a tad messy with a mixture of 3 different types (?) of chairs...I may come back to this place - but only on a weekday to avoid any possible crowds forming.If you're driving to this place, take note that parking is very limited along the streets (coupon parking)

The stand out memory of The Coffee Daily is unfortunately the slow service on what was a very quiet day.On entry, three tables were occupied and no staff were in sight. We seated ourselves and collected the menu from next to the cash register. There were lengthy waits for our order to be taken and food to arrive.The food was average. We ordered a salmon and guacamole on toast, and a signature dish called The Mountain. The salmon and guac was the better of the two, but the lovely taste of the salmon was swamped in guacamole. The Mountain, looked nice, but the rich taste was very overbearing. The scramble eggs were infused with truffle, this was combined with pork sausage and potato fritters. The menu said there were caramelised onions - the plate said there was not. This signature dish needed something light to balance the otherwise richer flavours.The coffee sizes were quite small, but the taste was one of the better coffee tastes I have come across in Singapore. We tried our luck with the dessert, but this took its time as well. It was nice enough, but not outstanding.The personal highlight was meeting a very friendly street cat outside the café. His service was impeccable - approaching me immediately and ensuring I got my cat fix for the week.I probably will not be back to eat here. I may come back to pat the cat

Came here with 2 friends for a quick afternoon get-away from a harsh day of work, and was instantly soothed when i entered the cafe.The combination of dim lightings and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee definitely helped to take my mind off a horrid day.Had their signature rainbow cakes and a hot cappuccino. Both were of above average quality

There is very little not to like about The Daily Coffee. Great coffees, a decent variety of ice cream flavors and a selection of micro-brewed Nest beer. The interior is also cute, with retro-looking furniture and decor. It's location is a huge plus - away from the main bustle of Serangoon Gardens but close enough for convenience. The Daily Coffee is a definite thumbs up.The cafe closes a little earlier than I would have liked at 11pm (last order at 10.30pm) but for the fantastic coffee, this is something I can live with
