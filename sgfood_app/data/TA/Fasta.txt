Went with a group of 7 so we tried many pastas. Personally felt that the make your own bowls were more flavourful and worth it than the pastas :) but great ambiance!!

The char siew angelhair is a superb dish. Very well marinated char siew and angelhair tossed it just so al dente. Will definetely patronize again. Hope they will come out with set lunch promotion.

The portion was good. Chose the option to make your own pasta. Added scallops which they gave 3 pieces and salmon which were cooked salmon pieces. Yuzu sauce was good. Small place so if there is a big crowd, it can get noisy.

Had the Sio Ba pasta. Very good, particularly the roasted pork. Ordered a side of mixed seafood which was also really tasty. Really enjoyed this as a quick, casual, simple lunch spot.

As well options of customising your own fasta.Ordered Chickinaki.... Service was quick.Liked the food... Though average. Moreover chicken didn't feel tender and fresh.Overall had an average experience

I was here a couple of months ago for a quick lunch with a friend. The options looked healthy, so I was quite excited! I got a make-your-own Pesto bowl with Penne, Pesto, Mushrooms, Baby Spinach, Flaked Almonds, and Peppers. I haven't had a more oily bowl of Pasta ever, it wasn't a pleasant sheen of olive oil coating the ingredients, but entire pools drowning the food. I'm not going to be eating here again

not a bad idea with a menu including a selection of fusion pasta, some are quite nice and portion is okay, but please do something about the ventilation inside!!! Just being in there for 5mins to place your order and wait for your take out means that you spend the rest of the day smelling like their kitchen. Just go visit and you will realise that everyone who chooses to dine there prefer to sit outside (take a hint!) Don't visit if you have a pet peeve of smelling like cooked/fried food after lunch/dinner

Ordered the siow ba mee, porkarita pasta, tuna poke pasta and a DIY bowl. The porkarita pasta tasted below average - would give it a 2/10 because it was so heavily drenched in cheese that it got 'gelat' after a while; couldn't even finish half of the bowl. The siow ba mee and tuna poke pasta were not bad, but not super impressive. Ordered the truffled quinoa for the DIY bowl and sadly, there was so trace of truffle at all! Added on salmon (+$4) to the DIY bowl but the chunks of salmon were terribly small and measly, and I probably spotted around 3-4 chunks of salmon only. The service was not too good as well bc the man at the counter/cashier was pulling a long face and sounded reluctant to take our orders. Moreover, it took quite awhile for our pasta to be served even though there were only around 7-10 other patrons in the restaurant. The only saving grace was the design of the restaurant I guess - the interior was well decorated and pretty cosy (but there are limited seats around)

Fasta is a small no-frills pasta join where you order at the counter but don't let it deter you. The pasta was absolutely delicious with an Asian twist. The scallop wallop pasta with a slight hint of spice and Japanese seafood sprinkles was al dente' perfect, fresh and tasty. The pork belly pasta was just as yummy. We had the Cajun prawns to share and it was pleasantly spicy. You can choose the type of pasta too. The house ice lemon tea was good value. Service was polite. The pasta dishes did not come together but it was ok. Worth going back for the fusion fresh pasta

Hidden in a corner at south beach. I had the Scallop wallop and tuna poke. The scallop wallop is savoury with fresh scallops and crabmeat given and the tuna poke has a fresh tomato sauce with a nice tang. The pastas were just nice being al dente
