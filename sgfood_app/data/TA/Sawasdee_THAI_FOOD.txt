On of the best Thai food I tasted.
Friendly people, good chef. Chang and Singha on the table. You have to try the green curry.
2
Itâ€™s one of the quieter eating places on a busy tourist street. But the food isnâ€™t great, the young coconut is old, and everything is double the price that you pay a few streets further on. Still a good place to enjoy the bustle of touristy Chinatown

This place is not easy to spot. It is one on many with a hawker out front pushing a beer under their front tent in the heat of Pagoda Street.We were really hot and sitting under the tent did not seem cool enough so we asked to go into the restaurant. It WAS cool and almost no one there unlike the tent just ouside the door . We had a drink, got comfortable and looked at the menu. Thai and a knowledgeable selection!We ordered several dishes, and enjoyed everything. Extra lime, bean sprouts and cilantro were quickly brought when requested. Service was good, prices fair and food good. What more could you ask for in a tourist thick street
4
Husband and wife owners present during lunch rush hour. Both were very nice. There sign out front caught my eye so decided to try it out. Since I already had lunch I ordered fried banana with coconut ice cream. Ice cream portion was plenty but not much on the banana...I'd say they should've added 1 more slice/piece. Inside of restaurant is clean. Bathroom was clean. Prices are fair looking at the food menu. Nice mix of choices to choose from ....I'd go there again for eating Main Course next time

I think the location was near the Hindu temple I cannot recall the street . Went there after visiting the Chinese Museum . Food was delicious . The tofu dish was very tasty . We ordered the shrimp dish and the mango salad.heavenly the fried rice was good. The place was very clean as were the bathrooms but then that is what Singapore is all about cleanliness at its best..Good vegetarian food . Our friend is a vegetarian who recommended this place. I think they are also in the U

Wanted to try another casual Thai restaurant other than the Express chain and the ones we frequent at Golden Mile.We ordered olive fried rice and pork basil rice. Both dishes are tasty, you can also customise the level of spiciness. We also liked the decor of the resnt. Only grouch is my husband ordered a sunny side up to add on to his fried rice, it costs $2 which we feel were a tad overpriced but we did not ask for the price prior so I guess we are at fault as well
5
Although not advertised, the English speaking waitress and owner were able to sort out a scrumptious meal for my wife and my meal was just as tasty! Service was good and the meal was very quick! Also ordered a iced green tea, never had one before, very tasty! The restaurant was not busy when we entered, but it soon got busy! Thereâ€™s some interesting history behind the restaurant as well
4
After a long touristy day, we found ourselves in Chinatown looking for a noodle soup place but came upon Sawasdee Restaurant instead. A serendipitous find. We ordered the steamed whole fish with lime and ginger, green papaya salad, and morning glory stir-fried with garlic. All the dishes were very fresh and well prepared. Yum! We chose to sit inside where it was cooler and less humid. Would be happy to return again to try other items
4
There are a number of outside tables with red plastic chairs and plastic tablecloths. But don't let that put you off because the food here is very good. Okay, you may find yourself looking at a line of drink fridges but the food and service are both really good. All the dishes we ordered were large portions and so, if you have starters, you may want to share a main between two people rather than order two mains. Pagoda Street is in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown with lots of restaurants, shops and stalls all along the street. At night it is bustling and lively, and sitting at one of the outside tables eating Sawasdee's great food watching the people walk by is a great way to spend an evening

First night in Singapore so we headed to China Town for authentic Asian food. I'm not too adventurous with food so tend to stick with chicken/duck/vegetarian. I ordered the tofu with vegetables and egg fried rice. The food tasted really good and full of flavour but I was disappointed with the lack of vegetables in what was supposed to be two things; tofu and veg. I counted; four pieces of green pepper and plenty of onion. I also ordered a glass of red wine but was horrified to receive chilled red wine in a chilled glass . Apparently this is what they do here. We were told at another restaurant that as it's always warm, people want cold drinks?? Why not have a different drink?? . This review is based on my experience, I'm sure if there was a better tofu/veg ratio and the wine wasn't cold, I would have walked away a happy customer
4
The food is from excellent quality. Everything is fresh. Next to Thai food the serve also chines food. You can choose from a large range of dishes against a reasonable price. They serve a small lunch between SD6 and SD10.
5
fantastic little place, great food, I mean great food, a couple of singha's, some wine, curry and rice and satay noodles and people watching, as they wander past into the markets in Chinatown - and just a short stroll from the tintin shop!
5
Good food, friendly staff. Try their CHILLI CRAB.....yummy. Outdoor sittings as well as indoor aircon comfort. Clean toilets, something you do not find in Chinatown restaurants.
4
Beautiful food. Served with so many smiles.
My colleague suggested this wonderful place. His advice was spot on.
Situated in the centre of China town Singapore the Sawasdee has beautiful well flavoured food and well presented.
Very good.
5
Located in Chinatown we stopped in gor a wuick bite while going through the markets. We weren't certain what to expect but the friendly stafg made us feel welcomed. We had a green mango salad, vegatarian spring rolls, and real mango fruit smoothies. The food was fresh and tasty. Well worth a visit
4
We came across Sawasdee whilst wandering around on our final night in Singapore. Restaurants with vegetarian options seemed to be few and far between in this part of town, so Sawasdee was our best option (with English and German menus, tourists probably form a large part of their clientele). We liked the casual outdoor dining area, and can vouch for the tastiness of the vegie spring rolls, Bai Kra Pow Tofu, Khao Pad Sapparod Pa, and coconut ice-cream. Food and drink prices are on par with Australian prices. We would consider a retun visit if we're ever back in Singapore
5
I was there in 2012 and during my stay in June 2017 I was looking for this place. I remembered the shrimps in black pepper souce. Guess what: thay are as good as they were few years back. We were eating lunch there every day. Reasonable prices however the meals sizes are medium/small
5
On entry got a warm welcome, was not dominated by the starf to sit in a table of choice but was allowed to sit any where. The Owner was very friendly and took our order which we had to write. Ordered for Chicken n pork .. the food was just amazing n tasted nothing like the fried rice available in India... a whole hearted thanks to the staff for the lovely lunch n time..
5
Come to Singapore 4 -5 times a year and make a point of it to eat her at least ones on every tripAlways eat nr 15 and nr 70Best stuff there is Just make sure to ask for spicy as Thai food has to be
5
We stayed in Clarke Quay so this restaurant was very convenient only 1 stop away at china town on the MRT. The restaurant has inside (air conditioned ) and outside dining. The food is great and well priced. The restaurant and toilets are clean and staff are friendly
4
A nice welcoming friendly restaurant. We stopped for a beer and it was late but we were welcomed even though we did not eat there. Well worth a visit - lovely place to sit and watch passers by
5
Delicious food, and very nice staff. They took care of our suitcases and were so friendly. I have been here before and will definitely come back next time in Singapore.
4
We found this little gem when wandering through the markets. We then came back three nights in a row because the food was amazing! Perfect place to sit outside and people watch, listen to music and eat yummy Thai food! Service was great :)
5
Love Thai food and this was no exception...great food and excellent service! Owner and wife team up to give hands on wonderful experience! Open until late!
4
This was our first stop in singapore. We had the pad kee mao and penang chicken. Bother were good but portion could have been bigger. Two mains, rice, soda and beer was about $35us.
5
"Fantastic " value for money considering how much you pay everywhere else , friendly staff and yummo food.
5
nice food but quite expensive, phadtai seafood was the best, i love coconut ice cream, tomyam soup and thai milk tea! perfect dinner it was
5
Our third visit here,why,coz the food is great.my wife who is a notorious fussy eater.loves this place.had pad Thai with chicken,and never left any for me.i've tried different dishes.all good.if your down pagoda street,and want some good honest Thai food,come here.we will be back one more time before we go home
5
Maybe not the best serving dishes but the food is soooo good! I've been going here since it was in the old location and it's by far one of my all time favorite Thai restaurants EVER. Everything is delicious and so fresh. Try any curry, Tom Yum, spring rolls, chicken wings, fried rice, beef salad. Accompany it with a fresh cold coconut or Thai iced tea!
3
Quality: GoodAtmosphere: Good (indoor)Service: Good but waitress appears to be unsurePrice: AverageFood wise it was good. Tom Yum and BBQ Pork was great. Price is a bit higher (all above S$10) and not forgetting there is a 7% GST and 10% sercvice charge.Its a tourist street so do expect tourist price. I'd recommend for those who wish to have a nice place to dine of Thai cuisine plus tour around the area. Definitely not a restaurant for those on a budget
3
We had some thai curry, the taste was fine, food was ok, but you eat of plastic plates and sit on plastic chairs. Nothing special for such a high price. For this price you can have better food. Location is cool.
5
Delicious chicken dish. Fabulous service - the staff were more than accommodating. I would highly recommend. Wifi also good
5
Delicious, keeps you coming back for
More! The chef nailed all the dishes! Highly recommended! The restaurant customized all dishes to serve my taste pallet. If you are a sucker for spice this is paradise!
5
I have enjoyed many a meal here, the owners are very nice and welcoming and food is prepared in a very clean and hygienic kitchen.
5
We love the taste from most of the menu here. We always visit this place everytime we go to chinatown in singapore. Great menu,great taste,great service.
2
It was a hot afternoon. We wanted to sit indoor but the waitress said the air conditioning was not on so we could only sit outdoors. Minced pork with basil rice which is a very basic item on a Thai menu costs $15.90 (includes $1 steamed rice). There's 10% service charge and 7% GST. Food took a long time to arrive and we had to ask a few times. I have had much better Thai food in other parts of Singapore and cheaper price
3
Sawasdee is a Thai restaurant in the middle of Singapore's Chinatown, an area otherwise dominated by Chinese restaurants. It is owned and operated by a Thai woman, who was delighted to find out we were on holiday from Thailand and spent several minutes talking to us in Thai.Sawasdee offers the usual range of Thai favorites - Pad Thai, Tom Yum Kung, Som Tam, Tam Tua, Massaman Curry, and more.It also has an extensive range of coffees, teas and fruit juices.An historic site sign on the wall of the restaurant proclaims that this place was once an opium den. Opium was widely used and even officially condoned in Singapore, until it was outlawed in 1941
5
Best place for Thai in Singapore. Hot the thai boxing in Clarke Quay then come for thai food never been disappointed. Took some friends who were visiting Singapore and they came back before leaving.Ideal place to have good food, a lot of beer and sit and watch all the characters walking past on Pagoda St
4
Had a quick dinner at this restaurant.My favorite Thai food pad ka-prao was served in a very nice taste!It was delicious together with Singha beer.It was normal hot so not hot enough as normal Thai but I was talking to the guy to try the real one during my next visit
5
Food - great value and good quality (especially steamed fish)Location - fantastic viewing locationService - very good family service. Team great.Value - 5/5 for Singapore Alcohol - as cheap as you'll find in Singapore.Overall - love this place. Visit once a weekish.Not a white table cloth and grand cutlery sort of place. Is a great quality Thai with friendly service
3
Good place to have refreshments before lunch. We had fresh pineapple juice and frappe; both were good and tasty. There are many places like this in Chinatown :)
3
Typical Thai dinner. Great service and nice restaurant but just normal food and quiet atomsphere. Wouldnt go again.
4
This restaurant has a menu which is reasonable and tasty, Thai food is served with a smile and will not break the bank. The friendly staff will help unfortunate westerners through the Thai menu and hot was not that hot.Of interest to the historically minded, the venue was an Opium den until 1946
4
Excellent restaurant to take a rest from shopping in China Town.There are plenty of shaded seats outdoors good for people watching and inside in the airconFrom a refreshing cold iced tea or a ice cold tiger beer there is plenty to choose from and you can have lite bites of spring rolls or fish cakes or a more filling noodles or curry.There are also veggie options which do not disapoint and you can have your food not too spicy or more spicy according to your taste.We are frequent visitors to Singapore and come here every trip
4
Down the pagoda street in the hart of china town is this little great thai food place. I always benchmark the thai food by ordering a simple thai salad, a labh gai in this case and it was authentic. Delicious and fantastic, curries are also great and try the sun dried pork snack. Wash it all down with a cold singha
5
This is a lovely restaurant with indoor (aircon) and out door seating area - the range to choose from but as always I can not resist a Thai Green Curry.Fresh food and one of the best tasting Thai Green Curry ever not too spicy, just right it was lovely to sit in a clean zircon area and enjoy the food and a break from the sweltering heat.I would recommend this place and definitely revisit on o=my return to Singapore
4
Good family run Thai cafe in Chinatown.reasonable food at cheap prices.staff are lovely and will explain anything on the menu.the food is illustrated and all ingredients are listed in English so it's easy to pick a meal even if you haven't eaten Thai food before.nice simple food without too many spices.fresher tasting than chinese food.a n enjoyable rest from the heat and bustle of Chinatown.also good music playing
5
Lovely family-run bar and restaurant where you can sit with a beer and watch thousands of tourists wander up and down Pagoda Street. Only 2 or 3 minutes from Chinatown MRT station. Haven't had main meal here but satay is good and so are chicken wings. Mainly visited for drinks. Beer very reasonably priced by Singapore standards and bottles are large size.
3
My husband & I have eaten at this little haven in Chinatown on every visit to Singapore for more than 8 years. They used to make the most spectacular Thai Green Curry ( & probably more lovely dishes, but that is our favourite). This trip though we were so disappointed. The restaurant is still owned & run by the same lovely gentleman & his family - but the food was smaller in portion, tasteless & dry. To his credit the owner took 25% off the bill when we mentioned why we hadn't eaten all our food as he did recognize us from previous visits over the years. In addition the prices have gone up tremendously since the last visit 1 year ago. Whilst we understand Singapore is a horrifically expensive place to stay in - double the price for a meal compared with last year does seem over the top.Unfortunately, this may well have been our last visit to this particular restaurant
4
I love Thai food and so when I was in Chinatown Singapore, my boyfriend, who has also learned to love Thai food, found Sawasdee right smack in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Chinatown.It's definitely no fine dining place. We weren't looking for one anyway. We were just after a good Thai food place and it was nice that we took our break there. What to expect: simple sets of movable tables and chairs, some boxes stacked in a corner for organizing later, air-conditioning, a break from the Chinatown noise and a lot of really delicious Thai food, The place is clean enough. We were just looking for good Thai food and we found it in Sawasdee. Our waitress I think was Thai herself. Perhaps the cook is Thai too.:
4
Being hungry and crawling through financial district and club street on a Sunday evening, we have been at Sawasdee.
My friend had already been there years ago and remembered.
And the food was delicious and extremely flavor-some.
Absolutely solid, great and soothing.
Thank you, Sawasdee!
4
Had the massaman curry. Nice place to sit and watch the people go by. Good service, decent menu. Quality is good for the price.
5
You can sit outside in the heat and humidity or sit inside in the air conditioning. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lots of Thai dishes to choose from. Food was excellent. Beer was icy cold.
3
Went with friends for drinks / snack time. Lot of tourists as very much in middle of Chinatown. Good & prompt service. Enjoyed spending time there.
5
You could easily miss this fantastic restaurant, although its only 2 mins from the pagoda street exit of the china town MRT Its tucked between the souvenier stalls on pagoda street. Delicious food, very reasonable prices.
2
Thinking we were going to get a real Thai meal and as there was a good mixed crowd dining we opted for this restaurant, I holidayfor two -three months each year in Thailand and have traveled to all areas so know a bit about Thai currys, what we were given looked the part but the only flavours you could taste were pepper and chilly, plus the chicken meat was all brown and grisly, no white meat at all, very disappointing. It wasnt cheap either at S$45 for two bowls of something resembling a green curry, one boiled rice and two waters
5
This restaurant is one of the most knew in Singapore. I was staying in Singapore for 3 nights, and never one-day I did not come to eat there. It is very good food. Not too expensive. I always take Somtam Poo Pla Ra... Zabwer... I really truly enjoy the food there. The owner is good welcome. And kindly, She said to me if the food is not spicy like Thai people used to eat.... I can change it. Wowww i love that. And I can say again one more time is The best food I ever have in Singapore is Sawasdee Thai Food restaurant
4
My Thai friends wanted to go here. At first I questioned why they would come to a new country world renown for its cuisine and settle for an interpretation of a food they could easily eat daily. Then, I tried the food and was very pleased. It was orgasmic-ly good, in a metaphorical sense. Won't get Thailand prices, but you'll get decent prices given the quality and the fact that it's Singapore. I'd gladly visit this spot again
3
The foods that we ordered were OK. Spring roll, pineapple rice,curies,larb and etc. I can't say much about foods here. The bucket promotion for Singha was the best deal in this place for drink. The wine choices is limited and none of them meet my expectation.The service was good
4
My go to place on own, with wife and for cheapy with friends.Location - vibrant in centre of Chinatown. Good for being nosey and people watching.Beer and Wine - cheap and cold. Wine decent quality for price.Food - really good for the price. I have had many dishes on the menu and I enjoyed each one.Service - good. The staff are very pleasant and know their food. I think they've all been there for a while. It feels like a family run business - whether it is or not, I don't know.Overall - if you want a cheap, good quality Thai, try here.
4
We found a little gem in the heart of a very busy Chinatown. The food was fresh and fantastic, so tasty. The service was great and they served me Leo beer which I missed from our last visit to Thailand.
5
Spending a couple of weeks a year in Singapore on business, I'm always looking for good food in interesting locations at good prices. This place has it all! Nice staff and authentic cuisine, I will be back again!
3
If you love thai food... you'll gonna fall in love with this restaurant.. this is the best thai food restaurant in chinatown.. or maybe singapore... you must try this one...
4
I went there with a Thai and she liked the food - which is very rare for her in Thai restaurants outside Thailand. Also I like the food.Prices are decent (compared to Singapore food prices) but of course much higher than Thai food in Thailand. Nice little resting place in the middle of the China town marke
5
Sawasdee is one of the most authentic North East Thailand restaurants in Singapore. Located at the heart of China Town in Pagoda Street you have the choice of either sitting outside and watch the China Town bargain hunters pass by or if you prefer you can sit inside. In the evenings you will see most patrons outside soaking up the atmosphere.The restaurant offers a relaxed atmosphere with great Thai food. I particularly like their sea bass in lime and chilli sauce. Please remember to tell them if you prefer your food to be less spicy, otherwise you will get Thai style spice which is great for someone like me who loves spicy food but not good for those who don't. Beers are also reasonably priced
4
Had a great lunchtime meal here, sat outside watching the world go by with a beer and brilliant Thai food. This is the best I found in Singapore. It can get busy in this part of Chinatown but the staff were really helpful in finding a table and the service was grea
4
Stopped by Sawasdee THAI for dinner on a Friday night. Even though they are in the middle of Chinatown with bevies of tourists, Sawasdee feels like authentic Thai. I could detail what we had for dinner but there many selections and you should try for yourself. The staff truly made me feel like I was in the land of smiles. We will come back
5
Walked past a fair few people eating here and meals looked good so gave it a try. Was not disappointed extremely tasty meals and good service. Do not like extremely chilli hot meals and the waitress ensured we didn't get too much in our meals. Constant flow of people coming and going. Would definitely eat here again and recommend to friends. Very good prices for food and beer in Singapore.
3
Got back from Bangkok a week ago and wanted to continue enjoying thai food. This place is convenient location in Chinatown pagoda shopping lane. Very foreigners to enjoy. I was here 2 years ago and found it average. I still find the place average as the food does not wow me. The chicken has that funny boiled taste so it's clearly not thai style preparation. The bean sprouts are over used. Flavors were lacking and even with some more like juice it didn't help. They did upgrade the interior so that will attract more visitors. For me this is not good thai like Jai Thai on pervus street.
4
I have been many times at Sawasdee, either for an evening meal or just to relax and have a cold drink. The staff is always friendly. The menu card offers many different meals, which can easily be combined for a big group or a single person. You may chose the spiciness of your dishes. Great variety. While you wait for the food to come or are relaxing with a drink, it is fun watching the passersby, listening to their language and trying to find out which country they are from. As usually in China Town, there is a lot of activities. Great and friendly place to eat and relax for a moment with some spring rolls and a cold drink
5
A must, forget your five star restaurants, go street level in China town, it's touristy but seek out Swasadee, I have met many locals who dine here, food is really good and great value, every time in Singapore I come here
Happy travels
5
This place is now on my list of places to visit again.....the food was great and served up with a Thai smile. Good to sit with a cold beer and people watch on Pagoda St.
3
Located on the bustling Pagoda street, this place is lively with lot of tourist crowd.
Food is good with chef customizing the dishes upon request.
Overall a good place if you are looking for Thai food in Chinatown.
5
Watch people go by in busy Chinatown and enjoy great Thai food. Reasonably priced, good service and cold Singha beer - what's not to like? Try and enjoy
4
Located in the heart of Chinatown . You can sit and watch the tourists and locals pass as you dine.The food was good and the service efficient and friendly.Two pints of cold Tiger beer, a steamed rice and BBQ pork came to $37 including taxed and service
5
My friend told me to meet him at Sawasdee in Pagoda street for lunch, I was surprised that there was even a Thai restaurant in Chinatown central, but there it was tucked in among all the souvenir shops, temples and other chinatown sights and sounds.From the street it doesnt look much but the food is, well, the best Thai food in Singapore.This place was a real surprise, it is not a tourist trap, its just a place that sells the best thai food in Singapore. That is all
4
Came across this little piece of Thailand whilst doing our last mi ute shopping before our flight home. Waitresses are friendly and helpful, place is clean, free wi fi and great air con . Prices are really good for Singapore and most of all the food is fantastic, competes with dishes we have ate in Thailand, the lady who cooks them is lovely and it is her who comes and serves them up to you. Only downside is we have found it hours before we leave fir home 
3
I really hate to give an average rating since the food tasted great, but they missed up the food order, forgot to bring 1 dish, then ended up bringing 2 of the same dish, and finally we had to remind to bring bottles of water when we ordered at beginning. It wasn't that busy and it was early enough in the evening.Red curry chicken was decent, basil chicken was fantastic and on the spicier side. Calamari was interesting but good with the chili sauce. I liked the freshness of the prawn spring rolls. Limited options for vegetarians but some greens available.Yes, it is in the touristy Chinatown and only a few steps from Chinatown MRT, but disappointed we weren't better received
5
Excellent location to watch people and meet locals! Great cold beer and excellent food. They cater to your taste: more spicey, more coriander, ... The staff is brilliant: the owners are the most lovely people we've met - they will always be in our hearts! Thank you for all your help and warmest regards
3
Perhaps because it's located in the touristy part of China town, the place can charge so much for such small portion. Service can use some help as well, our waitress has very little command of English. We sat outside under the tarp; did not feel right eating as tourists stroll by looking at us as if we are in a show.We ordered the papaya salad, stir fried noodle, larb gai & noodle soup. All the dishes have the right Thai flavors which is hard to find in Singapore as the "Thai" restaurants we tried tend to over sweetened the dishes
