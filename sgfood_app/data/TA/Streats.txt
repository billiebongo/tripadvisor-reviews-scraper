Nice to try lunch for first time. There are lunch promotions with discount and free drink. A lot of variety to choose in the normal menu. But music is abit noisy to have conversation.

Inside raffles city and very close to city hall MRT. The place is simple, clean and tidy. The food (typical indonesian) is good too. Quite a lot choices. The staff warm and professional. I WILL GO THERE AGAIN!

What a great little place. At the back of the Raffles Marketplace, this is one of the best places to get your spicy fix! Try the Mee Goreng with chicken cutlet and finish it off with a Chongqing Chicken Basket. For those less adventurous, ask for these to be made "less spicy"or you may lose all feeling in your lips along the way! Absolutely awesome food at great prices kept me going back

honestly there are too many choices for one to eat at cityhall.but i popped into streats because of the cosy atmosphere and the comfortable layback style..cushions everywhere.huge tv for ppl to watch some singers performing.the porridge served in a claypot and to keep it warm there is a stove behind..my gungpodiced chicken is a bit spicy but i can accept it.the milk tea is thick and sweet enough.very satisfying meal overall.will be back to try other dishes

This casual eatery in Raffles City has good food at prices that are generally lower than other restaurants and eateries in the mall. For about S$31 my mum and I had two main dishes, one side dish and two drinks. I would recommend the Pumpkin Fries, Malays Carrot Cake and Basil Leaf Chicken set
