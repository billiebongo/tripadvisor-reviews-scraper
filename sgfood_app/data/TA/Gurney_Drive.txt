I have to say this is a great find. Food quality was really good and every dish we tried was great. The service was good.
Best dish was the black pepper beef wow.

Hubby and I had a craving for something tangy and came upon this eatery. Didn't dare to order too much, being afraid that portions may be big. Surprisingly, it isn't. We ordered the Penang Laksa (of course!!), the CharKwayTeow and the kangkong cuttlefish. Laksa was great and tangy but not enough fish!! Wished I could "top up" price for more fish!CKT was the best!Cuttlefish was a little too sweet. Service was ok, fast and fuss-less. Price was reasonable for the portion size
