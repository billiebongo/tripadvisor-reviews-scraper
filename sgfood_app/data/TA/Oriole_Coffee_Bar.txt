The coffee was lovely. I've ordered the espresso hotcakes and totally liked it, the espresso butter was a perfect match with the pancakes. Lovely coffee time ever.
4
Had the oriole burger and the chicken Alfredo. Food was good and so was the service. Coffee was the best!
4
Well. I had high expectations of this place actually. Felt the quality had dropped slightly. Wouldnt felt it be worth it entirely if not for entertainer.
However the staff were friendly and it was a great joy talking to them. Attentive and smiling!
5
It was my 2nd visit to this cafe and we were pleased with the service and food quality. Will certainly visit it again.
4
I always come here for the coffees and love a good burrito. If I am dropping by for dessert, I would definitely go for the affogato because the quality of the ice cream and espresso are out of this world!
5
The food was great. Even my friend agree this place is a hidden gem. Will surely be back again with other friends!
3
Not sure if they are short of service staffs or they are just not very helpful. Need some training I suppose
5
Great cafe cum bar in the heart of town. Area is rather small for inside and packed during peak period so better to make reservations. :)
4
The food at Oriole is pretty good, we would recommend the risotto, Southwestern Chicken (though this is a small portion) and Barramundi. Our fourth diner had the ribs and was not too impressed. For portion sizes, the risotto is definitely the best value for the money. Health-wise, the Barramundi and Southwestern chicken were quite light and had some good veggies. The ambiance is average, just another restaurant in a mall in Orchard. The service is slow and inattentive, but I find this to just be the Singapore standard. As it is Oriole Coffee, the coffee selection is obviously quite good. There is an assortment of different brews and types of drinks. The selection of cocktails is also not bad, they have a few different coffee cocktails that looked interesting.

Dining marred by terrible service. Waitress Maru gets worst server award for asking why I needed to see a menu again although I had ordered, giving annoyed looks, trying to charge me for food items I didn’t order and then making a fuss when I didn’t sign a receipt that said “no signature required” (she then discovered she had folded away the slip - but didn’t apologise). In Donald trump’s word: “Bad!
4
Went back to the restaurant after some time but it seems the service standard has dropped. Food was still good though.
5
We ordered the crab pasta - which was very nicely done, with a good dose of heat - and also the fried steak, which was relatively well executed. Service was good - the staff were friendly and accommodating with my little one. Will be back!
2
Reserved a table for 4+1, they reserved a good spot for us indoor. Shortage of stuffs but they were really friendly. However the food was not up to standard.
5
Food and service was fabulous. First time visit this restaurant. Try a few of the items on the brunch menu. Everything was nicely seasoned and balanced. Would definitely visit again.
5
Excellent service! The staff Siti was really friendly and courteous. Help to take nice pictures of us.
4
Service was impeccable! Ordered the prawn risotto and crab pasta to share and it was executed perfectly. Do save some stomach space for their sticky date pudding as well!
4
Food is reasonably priced, service stuffs are friendly. However food portions could be bigger.. tried the fish taco, fish n chips and fried steak. Was abit disappointed with the fried steak though
4
It’s was nice feeling chilling out at a bar music area with friends. The food is nice and service was good too. :)
2
Server didn’t inform about how the 1-for-1 promo is only available for the SAME drink - and not applicable for all alcohol types. Also, the short-hair waitress with braces didn’t even tell us there was a 1-for-1 for my friend’s drink so we just assumed both our drinks could be paid for the value of a drink. She was also super unfriendly. On the plus side, the food was pretty decent.
5
Quick service. Chic decor. We ordered the rueben which was delicious-soft and buttery with succulent pieces of meat. Bread was perfect. The philly cheese steak sandwich was tender and juicy. Bursts of spices and different flavours fills the tastebuds. The salad as well as the skinny fries were a nice addition too. Definitely going back
4
We were there for dinner and ordered a seafood pasta, fish and chips and nutella tart. All the dishes tasted great especially the nutella tart which was a sinful treat if you have a sweet tooth. The staff were also friendly. Would be back soon.
5
Nice cozy place to meet with friends. They have a very nice coffee menu and the food is good too. Will definitely recommend!
4
Nice Atmosphere and good coffee. The menu is more extensive than their sister outlet at Capitol piazza
5
Really good food, had the pancakes and skillet with lamb stew. Nice cosy place to chat and chill out!
4
server was very friendly and helpful. I had the fish tacos while my dining partner had fish and chips. The snapper was really fresh and tasty. Loved the batter coating. Oriole is now one of my favorite places for fries — thin cut, crispy even when they’ve turned cold, and the bbq seasoning powder = basically perfection. I’ll be back to try other things on the menu! One gripe: I wish the flour tortillas were more fragrant
2
The service at this restaurant was really quite bad. We used the entertainerme app and they then refused to let us enjoy the happy hour prices for drinks even though it was within the happy hour timing. Also, we ordered an appetizer and 2 mains, and they delivered one of the mains only as we were finishing the appetizer and the other main. Lastly, they kept us waiting for over 10 minutes for the return of my credit card and receipt after payment. We had to walk over to the cashier ourselves to check on it and we found the card and receipt just lying there unattended to. Oh the food quality was average at best. Don't bother visiting.
1
I rarely write reviews unless the place is exceptionally good or bad, and in this case, this restaurant is dreadful. I visited on 14/11/2017 for dinner with my friends. The service was poor from the start.Once we settled down, I asked the server for warm water but it never came???? Until our food was served by another server and I had to request again.Food was mediocre. Had the crabmeat capellini which was a little on the dry side but still edible. Fried steak was okay, mashed potato which was served along with it, can be slightly creamier. The ribs were quite good though!Anyway after our meal, we were sitting around chatting. My friends and I wanted to get desserts but no one came to offer us any menu or to clear our table. I waved a waitress over and requested her to clear our table + pass a menu and she said she's in charge of serving the table outside so she can't take out order. She passed me a menu and said she'll get her colleague to clear the table BUT NO ONE CAME??? Even after 10min????In the end, we gave up and just asked for the bill. And the manager (I suppose he's the manager since he wasn't wearing the same uniform as the other staff) was the worst example/ role model. He DIDNT even say a single word and just passed the bill over, not even a smile?? Err I thought this is a restaurant not a coffee shop. The service is appalling. I wouldn't waste my time here. There are better restaurants with BETTER service in Somerset. Argh appalling.

I had coffee and breakfast here 3 days in a row! Perfect place to start your day in Singapore! Their coffee is perfect! I’m very lactose intolerant and they have their own signature in-house nut milk made from macadamia, almond and dates! Sooooo good! Just wish I could take it home with me!
1
i reviewed this place before and gave it a good review until i discovered how they ripped me off when i got home to check my bill. This place did not ask me whether or not i wanted to pay in Singapore Dollars or in Sterling. They have done this so that they could charge their own exchange rate (always pay in local currency). You normally get asked this question, but i was not asked at all. I would probably say that any company that does ask you is probably not anyone worth doing any business with. I will be taking this up with my credit card company. I only discovered this once i got home to review my bills in detail. They are supposed to ask you and have acted in a dishonest and corrupt manner. I Will also be making a complaint to the authorities in Singapore about this corrupt behaviour. To the proprietor, please feel free to respond to my comments (if you dare), as i would be interested to know what you have to say
4
I needed a coffee and to sit as I had been walking around all morning. Well can I say that they have great coffee and the food is sooooo good. So fresh, nothing fancy, just good.Staff nice and friendly and priced well. Can't wait to visit again
4
The Fish and Chips were good! Perhaps to go early or make reservation, since it may get quite packed or crowded over time.
3
Had coffee and brunch - was good! Place was packed when we arrived but coffee and food came quickly. However, service was v slow towards the end - with almost half hour for dessert - a tad too long.
5
Place where u can enjoy great coffee with some entertainment observing the crowd. Staff were friendly and attentive.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the evening with my family celebrating my brother's bday at oriole! Service staff was attentive, accommodating and even threw a surprise complimentary bday cake after our meal. Highly recommended for good food and good service in town :)
4
went during lunch and found the set lunch pretty value for money. it was also a great place for a quiet lunch.
4
Would return for the coffee. Nice hangout location along orchard road. Have yet to try the food here but the range of coffees is good.
5
Firstly, I love the ambience and location of this place, right smack in between 313 Somerset and Mandarin Singapore. The lighting and decor of the place was of an exquisite taste.Secondly, we were served and seated by an extremely customer focused and extremely polite host - Darius. He made us felt so at home and paid a lot of attention to us and also to the queries we posted. He should be the next employee of the month!Thirdly, the food that we ordered was of exquisite preparation and taste - compliments to the chef! But most important of all, was the excellent recommendations made to us by Darius.Fourthly, we were able to celebrate my mother in law"s birthday and the staff came out with the cake and sang the happy birthday song. That was indeed a beautiful touch to end off an excellent evening!Lastly, when we departed the place, the staff stood by the door and bade us farewell and good tidings for the night. What excellent customer service! I give this place 5 thumbs up
4
Had dinner there on a Friday night, pretty crowded by 8pm and the tables were very close together (kinda awkward to chat), not much privacy in seating space. Service was slow, server looked busy and barely served you except when taking your ordersFree ice water is available (self-service).Ice latte was good, more to milky taste but coffee taste was great even though lesser. Ice chocolate came in a cute mini bottle but the serving is quite huge, around 1.5 glass for that tiny size. Flavor was rich.Truffle beef burger came with fries that was seasoned well! Patty was done medium well though but still moist. Truffle smell and taste was faint.Beef sandwich (my personal fave!) - served generously with fries and a side salad. Slabs of slices beef was served in between the thick fluffy multigrain bread with melted cheese. Delicious! Chocolate cake tasted too soft and sweet with the thick chocolate ganache. Serve with vanilla ice cream and sugar coated walnuts. Don't really prefer it, a heavy end to our meal.Overall very nice food and drinks, affordable as well but just that service can be improve.
4
Great breakfast and reasonable priced ($20 for large breakfast of eggs, bacon, port sausages, mushrooms, tomato. And toast.Comfortable surrounding. Down side - staff appear uninterested. Had to obtain water and glasses ourselves and needed to provide staff twice for the taking of an order.Meal took 20 minutes to arrive
4
I went this morning, and despite the staff being overworked, everything was delicious. It was really busy and there was only one waiter - they should consider hiring more staff to keep up with the demand. The coffee was really amazing and there were lots of different choices including cold brew and hand brew. The food - avocado on toast was just right. Highly recommend it
5
Quieter in the morning. Which is great for work discussion. Has an interesting combination of coffee drink where you get to taste 3 different kinds of coffee. Definitely enjoyed the drink a lot
5
First time to visit this place ... I like the ambience and the staff are very accommodating.... very nice food and the coffee I love to much ... I highly recommend this place.
4
I like coming to this cafe for the very friendly service and the value-for-money set meals. Love their Prawn risotto and Crab meat capellini, and their excellent coffee. The only thing I am not a big fan of is their truffle fries.
5
We had the blue cheese chicken burger and it was fantastic. Even the bun was good and I usually don't finish 1 of the buns.
4
Located right in the middle of Orchard Road, Oriole is great breakfast venue or a drink after work when they have live music playing. Great coffee and te MAD (macadamia almond date) milk is a real treat.
5
The place was cozy and the atmosphere was really good. There was a live band which was so serenading..Food was excellent! Desserts even more! Will be back!!
4
We arrived from our flight at 5am. In search for a coffee seemed harder than once thought, unless you wanted a chain coffee. Prompt service and professional! Coffees were amazing. Iced black and the tasting platter. The Bircher muesli was delicious also. Thank you!
4
Just dropped in for a quick coffee and there were plenty to choose from. You can choose air con or outside seating but indoors is very popular especially in the afternoon heat! Service was a bit dour but ignore it and enjoy yourself!
5
I've been to Oriole for lunches, dinners and after work drinks and I've always come away happy. I enjoy the Ruben and Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches in particular. The service is efficient and the music is usually pretty good too.
3
The coffee was good, servee was a little non talkative. Non the less enjoyable. Sitting among the shops and fashionistas.
5
Oriole is a real gem in town. The coffee, food and espresso martini here are delicious. The prices are standard for town. Would definitely recommend it.
4
Nice location a little off Orchard Road. Inside and outside seating. Good food and relative decent prices. Quick service.
4
Great coffee & good food. Best value to take the set lunch on weekdays. Favs include Fish & Chips, Caesar wrap, Truffle burger, crabmeat egg benedict. For choc lovers, try their Haut Chocolate, which is a super rich iced chocolate. That really hits the spot!
2
The staff were friendly, however the iced chocolate my husband had was the most expensive and tasteless he has ever had. S$10.00++
We won't be going back!
4
Had some great burgers/sangas and beer here which were absolutely delicious but... The service was a bit off. One of the waiters must have been having an awful day as it looked like he'd been sucking on lemons!!!We had to wave down the servers to get service but I'd eat here again- no complaints on the food
4
Right at the 313 Mall, but still very cosy. We could eat outside, despite the heat, because of the very well placed fans. As usual service was very good, but I don't understand why the 2 of us did not get our food together... That being said, it is the only unpositive thing I can say, as the food tasted good; was cheap and was presented very nicely. oh, the Nutella dessert is a must!!
5
What's not good about this place? The coffee is good, the fish n chips is very good, there is 1-for-1 beer at $18++ for 2 pints from 3-9pm! Snapper is used for their fish n chips, served with homemade tartare sauce. The chicken tikka is good too
4
When we first arrived my niece requested a table inside as she had her twins with us and needed the air conditioning and high chairs, at first the gentleman who showed us to the table put us up the back and the pram ended up in front of a door which needed to be used, as we were leaving due to not enough room, when a large group left and we were seated, the pram was left outside near the door. The service was good and accommodating of the twins, the food was very nice, I had the Caesar wrap and chips while my partner had Fish and Chips, both were very nice.We will be back next time we visit Singapor
4
Their weekday set lunch meal is a steal, considering the location, the environment and the food. I have been there four times in a month so far. It's perfect for a quick chatty stop over with friends. There is an air con section and an outdoor section which is quieter.Although the presentation is impeccable, the fashion styled food has room for fine fine tuning. The crabmeat capellini is bland, roasted pork ribs is too sweet aka Chinese char siew (the small chopped garlic mix serves no purpose) Fish and chips is made with nice chunks of firm fish but I prefer thicker chips rather than those toothpick size. Waffles are delicious with perfect buttery taste, dates pudding looks messy but very enjoyable in the mouth.Coffee: don't try the caffè latte if you aren't a fan of acidity. Yet their caffè latte is smooth and well balanced. Don't be afraid to chat up with the staffs. They are actually a very exuberant group who will brighten up your day.
4
The place is nice. Nice ambiance in and out door. Good location to reach by mrt exit in sommerset station. We love the crab oglio olio. Perry good. As well as the coffee cake, although it is a bit too sweet. Have promotion for uob card : meals discount or buy 1 get 1 beer.Definitely will come back.
5
I always return to this cafe for a latte when I'm in the Orchard Central area. It is technically well made by a barister with a rosetta. The house blend has sweet overtones that go well with milk. Life is too short for lousy coffee.
3
Can recommend the Fish tacos- very tasty, coffee was OK, service was slow, we had to ask for our order to be taken and our sparkling water took ages to turn up.
3
LOCATION: Somerset 313 (entrance) - nice to sit outside; free wifi
FOOD + TIP: Try the pumpkin salad with kale - it is delicious!
VALUE FOR MONEY: average
4
Had breakfast here recently.The egg benedict was nice, just that we had topay for add-on like sautéed spinach. The coffee was good, as expected from my previous visits.A big plus was the friendly staff. Halfway through, we moved indoors as it was getting a bit humid outside - the staff was very good about it

You'd be hard-pressed to find a decent brunch spot on Saturday along Orchard Road. Especially, one that isn't too crowded or noisy, to get some decent reading done, while injecting some caffeine into the bloodstream. Oriole was, however, able to check those two boxes. One of my favourite items on any brunch menu is the shashuka — runny eggs in a mildly spicy tomato base, served in a hot skillet. Oriole's take on it comes with stewed lamb cubes and at least 3 eggs. As much as I'd like to say that it was good, it wasn't. I was first served one with the eggs thoroughly cooked, and that should never be. The eggs should be runny and gooey, to dip your crisp toast into. After I mentioned that the eggs were overcooked, I was shortly served a new one. This time the eggs were undercooked. At this point, the pieces of toasts that they had initially forgotten to serve me were already soft. The junior servers, as inexperienced as they seem, do try, and for that they deserve certain commendation. As for the food, I reckon they should look into making distinct improvements. For one, to get the cook time for their dishes down pat, for sake of consistency and quality. Also, perhaps, have food portions that match their namesake. It's something to think about when you hear customers laugh at the portion of your ambitiously-named, Twinkie-sized "Jumbo Burrito"
3
Came here for dinner last evening and ordered their Fish and Chips with chips changed to salad.Service was excellent with friendly staff and flexible ordering. Many times at other places folks just refuse to swop fries for salads...Orders arrived in a timely manner.Fish batter was nicely crisp but the fish itself was overdone. I paid $20 for this meal and don't even find it as delicious as what I can get from Fish and Co for less.So definitely don't bother with fish here...Generally I find food overpriced for the amount presented here. Two other friends ordered a caesar wrap and it was very skinny compared to what you can get from salad shops outside
5
'Were Looking for the best cold brewed coffee in town. Started with this one. Oriole shakerato ( black & white both ) was classic ! The yummy Almond powder that comes with the ice cream & chocolate fudge cake was delicious ! Good place to hang out
3
We had two flat whites each and a reuben sandwich to share.Coffee was decent but I suspect the beans were too fresh (not rested after being roasted).However, it was the reuben sandwich that will make me come back again to this cafe - a fairly large portion (sufficient for the average hungry person) and accompanied by a small salad and REALLY yummy spicy french fries! Loved the fries...However, the greeter (on 11 Dec) had a really impatient attitude and really made me want to walk out. Luckily, the manager on duty was a lovely person and saved the day.Prices are subject to 10% + 7% ta
4
I visited here when I was in Singapore visiting my best friend and the coffee was great and the breakfast menu. This place is a funky little place that had good atmosphere as well. I had a few lattes and a big cooked breakfast. The bacon wasn't cooked to my liking, but that was a personal preference. I would go back again.
3
This is a busy place next to the shops of Orchard Road and you may have to queue. However, part of this seemed to stem from confused staff as there were plenty of tables available. The coffee order was initially incorrect but once we had our coffees they were good
4
Nice selection of western food, all kinds of eggs, ingredient is fresh, near MRT. Drinks is slightly over priced.
3
The burger was good. Everything else was average. The service was fairly quick, the food was warm, and that's it. Nothing really stands out about this cafe. I would visit there again if I was in the area, but would not make any additional effort.
3
Tried their signature cold brew white coffee and also had a cup of flat white. Didn't have any meal as it was a late afternoon and I was feeling pretty full after a heavy lunch. I wanted to try their MAD milk a non-dairy variant but too bad they were sold out on that day. The drinks were average and slightly overpriced but the service was attentive

After ordering three $19 set-meals: Fish and Chips, Beef Cheek Tagliatelle (“Italian Meepok”), Capellini (“Italian Beehoon”) Crabmeat, each comprising 1 main + 1 coffee, my friends and I sat down and waited expectantly, as it was our first visit to the café at the PP Serviced Suites@Somerset. Very much to our surprise and chagrin, 3 hot coffees were indeed the first items to appear at our table, prior to the arrival of any food (which took some time to come). We thus faced the dilemma of either having hot coffee on its own (and disrupting our appetites totally) or having cold coffee with the food later. Staff “A”, while friendly, appeared clueless, yet somewhat defensive about the matter, insisting that it was the Oriole way (and staff instructed accordingly). “A” hinted that it should really be our fault for not telling Staff “B” (who took our orders earlier) that we wanted the coffee only after or together with our food. We let go of that as being part of workplace politics; also considering that issues of service protocol would not be under either staff’s purview.Our dining experience was thus marred, despite the food we have had being satisfactory and the coffee being strong and aromatic. Hopefully, the front-line staff would get some enhanced training or empowerment on spot or flexible decision-making or otherwise, ability to escalate to higher levels for service-problem resolution

I am really very disappointed with this establishment as today I nearly choked whilst eating their beef pie and am very disturbed by the lack of understanding that this could have been serious. I realized several things were wrong with my meat pie including the meat being tough, the meat being in very large pieces and finally the worse is that it had large fatty pieces attached to those very large lumps of meat.Because of the above a piece of meat got stuck in my throat and I struggled to pull it from my throat as my hand struggled to grab the fat. I knew enough not to panic and fortunately got this out of my throat without tearing the fat as it could have blocked my airway I also had two certified first aiders at my table. Now I chose to stop eating and we told the waitress what had happened and why I had left the meal. Whilst she did refund the cost of that $10 pie she seemed totally unconcerned with the kitchen knowing that this had happened and that they could've killed someone. No apology or are you okay, which really bothers me.Please do not eat one of their meat pies. I have had other dishes here without incident but today I don't feel like going back here again

The cafe is located within walking distance from the MRT station. There is both indoor aircon and outdoor open air dine in area. There is free wifi in the cafe, as free wifi from the mall. The indoor are was a tab dark in lighting. Grilled Truffle Cheese Sandwich ($14)Grilled buttery brioche bread stuffed with truffle cheese, emmental cheese and oak-smoked cheddar, served with tomato cheddar soup.The truffle oil smell was a tab light. The cheesy crispy sandwich was delicious when dipped with the tangy tomato soup. I wished that the soup could be served smoky hot. It was just warm.Smoked Salmon Rosti ($16)Crispy potato rosti topped wti h smoked salmon, capers, creme frachie and fresh onions.The rosti was not quite what I was expected. I suspected it was machined shredded as the potato was long and thin, making it dry without the mushy potato texture. It made one felt like having potato noodles. The creme frachie was light which balanced the salty smoked salmon, although I preferred the strong flavoured sour cream to go with it.There is a free regular coffee promotion with every order of weekend brunch items. Since I ordered 2 brunch items, I had as Cappuccino ($5.50) and Latte ($5.50) as the free drinks. Could not taste the different between the both drinks as both are quite milky
5
A calm oasis near to the frenetic activity on Orchard road.Great coffee: espresso/Americano: (Regular coffee stop nr the office)Good brunch, salads, snacks, mains. Reasonably priced, and a loyalty cardGood for a chat during the day - nice location can sit out and watch the world go by or eat in.Lively at night with bar service.Excellent service, no pressure
5
I come from Melbourne where the coffee is wonderful, this place has been a life saver for me as the climate here doesn't really warrant as many cafes so finding a coffee I like has been a bit challenging. This place however makes a great latte and I have also enjoyed a number of breakfast there. We have been in temporary accommodation for nearly a month nearby so have also gotten to know the staff who are also very polite and friendl
4
We came here 3 morning during our 10 night stay in Singapore. It seems to be a Singapore thing that scrambled eggs are served very wet which isn't something I like. The staff were fab and did them "well done for me" :) The coffee is lovely and I can highly recommend their chocolate milkshake.
4
This is a nice café with excellent location. One of the must items is the Death Cream (SGD9++), which is iced coffee with cream and vanilla beans. I like the fact that it is made with real vanilla instead of vanilla flavour. They always have coffee from a specific origin, which is a plus. But once I had an espresso made of Ethiopian beans and found it way too acidic. With milk, it should be okay but not as an espresso. Service is usually very good but once there was a bit of delay at payment. If you plan to spend a longer time inside, bring a jacket or sweater, because it's too cold inside, even compared to Singapore aircon standard. I still recommend this place to people who wanna get away from big chains with generic coffees
3
Service was friendly, polite and efficient. Coffee was good even had a second! Breakfast ok not a fan of oven cooked bacon, avocado black fibres running through it, salad without dressing
5
Coffee and food is nice . Price also reasonable and service also kind and polite . Thank for the food is excellent . Have a great lunch . 👍👍
4
Great place for coffee friendly service the milk ice coffee is so good it's nice easy place to relax either inside in the air conditioning or outside go have a coffee
5
Located in 313 Orchard, coming out from the Somerset stop, we were looking for a place we could sit, have a beer and a cigarette. This place was perfect! Although we weren't able to try the food, they had Kornenbourg from the tap at 1 for one. (12 SGD per order at posting time) Service was pretty good actually, staff was friendly, our orders were taken appropriately and they were very accommodating.
5
Good coffee, great staff, comfortable place to relax in the afternoon. Flat white was abit sour but mocha was great. Overall still worth a visi
5
My wife and I called in here for a quick bite to eat, one evening whilst in the Orchard Rd area. I decided on the Truffle burger which came with fries in a cajun coating, both were delicious, one of the best burgers I have ever had, cost S$18 (approx £9). My wife chose the prawn risotto and was not disappointed, both meals very, very good.Only downside was the cost of beer at S$18 a pint.Also a special mention for Peter our waiter, very friendly and spent time with us giving us a run down to the area, due to it being our first visit.Highly recommended!
5
I had their house blend latte and they were awesome. Went again the next day for their coffee. Tried other coffees from independent cafes around that area, and nothing beats Oriole's! It's so good that I brought home a bag of their coffee beans.They also have a cupping session and have a chat with the baristas, I should try it my next trip
5
I went to this yesterday after my dessert elsewhere. I ordered Flat White which came perfectly in coffee artwork. The coffee beans roasted at perfect medium which made it nice in aroma, not much acidity, good flavor and aftertaste. Indoor seating was quite comfy and air conditioning works very well in the hot day. The service was decent but not really friendly.
4
We popped in for a Sunday morning breakfast, choice of indoor and outdoor dining were readily available. My wife had an edgy fresh juice with pear& lemon juice with cayenne pepper, very interesting and she loved it. She had a breakfast burrito which she thoroughly enjoyed. I had the breakfast skillet, which had sous vide eggs, lamb stew, sweet potatoes and cheese. Very tasty and quite different.Coffee was very flavoursome and service was prompt and friendly
3
I was at Somerset one weekday evening with friends and needed a quick bite. We popped into this restaurant, as it wasn’t crowded.I shared with a friend:- Fish and Chips. Thick chunky pieces of fish in a breaded crust. Fries were done Cajun style. This particular dish is different from the traditional ones at most places.- Chicken Tikka: Chicken pieces nicely marinated and grilled. Served with a yoghurt dip on the side. Tastes good, even though it's served in a western cafe. They do have Happy Hour promotion, where some beers and wines are ‘1 for 1’
5
Thanks a lots, I have had on the place one of the best drip coffee in the Singapore. Also cappuccino is very nice and smooth. Very nice and friendly personal.I hope, I will chance to comeback there again, soon.
4
Good ambience. Great coffee. Good food. Lovely ambience. Amazing location with both indoors and outdoors seating.
3
Had the Mexican burrito and Oriol Shakeel coffee. Didn't like the burrito due to large chunks of garlic.
Staff was friendly and accommodating.
4
Haven't been here for years.They have renovated.Indoor air conditioned cafe with plenty of outdoor seats.Many types of coffee. Will try Taisho another time.Has a good selection (7) of all day breakfast.4 salads From 11 a.m. onwards they serve their main courses (4 sandwiches & 9 classics) and small plates (3), pies (2) and desserts (6) of pudding, cakes and waffles.There are also cocktails, wines and sweet wines.We had: Cappuccino - hot but would prefer hotter.Oriole Truffle Burger - brioche bun, suvee-cooked beef patty, sautéed mushrooms, caramelised onions, mixed greens, melted cheese, truffle aioli, served with Oriole-spiced fries - $18.Fully Loaded breakfast "Breakfast of Champions" - a choice of 2 juicy pork or cheesy chicken sausages, 2 eggs done any style, maple glazed bacon, air-dried tomatoes, mushroom, baked beans and toast - $20. The chicken sausage was a total disappointment. Not tasty at all. Overall, good food and nice ambience. We still like this place.
5
Simply great coffee and nice food. The closest thing to a classic inner city Melbourne Cafe that I have yet seen in Singapore. I was very impressed by the texture and presentation of the flat white that I ordered, strong and creamy, good flavour, strong, nutty and relatively full bodied. Nicely developed microfoam and a good creme produced some sweet latte art without an overly think foam header. As is usual in Asia the coffee was a tad too dark roasted for my liking so still a bit bitter at the upper end and lacking the middle tones of a truly full bodied coffee that I love, but the coffee lingered well on the palate and needed very little sweetening. All in all very impressive and we'll worth a visitHistorically throughout Asia, the highest grades of coffee were always sold to Europe and America with only second grade coffee beans kept and used for the local market. Because they lacked the depth of flavour, these beans were then dark roasted to bring out bitterness and strength, which was then balanced by the addition of sugar. A lack of refrigeration also meant no use of milk and, also most coffee was drunk in afternoons or evenings along and deeply associated with smoking, (again traditionally second grand had rolled tobacco, with out filters). Coffee sold on the local market was also rarely blended but rather bought from one particular plantation or supplier through patronage relationships. This all brought about a tradition of deep, dark roasted, aromatic, black sweet coffees, traditionally made through simple pour over techniques and varying in taste profile from shop to shop. Coffee was relatively cheap and abundant fir the lower middle class and upwards, and you chose the coffee shop you liked and stuck with that for life. These traditions of coffee in Asia are very different to the traditions of coffee in much of Europe, where coffee did not grow but was imported from throughout the world. In Europe blending coffee to achieve a standardised taste became the norm. Making coffee using pressure to increase flavour extraction and filtering out the coffee grinds through a range of specialised equipment also all became norms as did the use of milk and hence the traditions of Caffè latte and cappuccinos. In the new worlds of America and Australia coffee traditions further evolved, with America becoming addicted to coffee on tap. Linkages to the slave trades and plantation/spice trades brought an abundance of coffee to America and unlike the expensive tea trade back to England it stuck. Americans started literally drip feeding themselves through out the day with bottomless quantities of relatively weak coffee, commonly only using whiteners rather than real milk again due to an initial lack of refrigeration. While America went in this direction and continues as such today, with volume mattering match more than flavour or quality, Australia went in the other direction. Coffee culture came much later to Australia. After an initial influx of British colonisers who were addicted to tea not coffee, the first and second world wars saw a massive influx of eauropens. Italians Greeks, Yugoslavians migrated to Australia as economic migrants hoping to rebuild their destroyed lives in the land of endless beaches. As they came they brought their coffee traditions with them, taking over the culture of British fish and chip shops and replacing them with a slightly European version with cappuccino machines lasagne and Greek salads along side American style hamburgers, and English fish and chips. These takeaways emerged in nearly every town in Australia, along with their neighbouring Chinese restaurant. Slowly but surely and particularly in areas with larger European immigrant groups these takeaways drifted back towards an immigrants fantasy of what a Cafe was back home. Becominh in many ways more European than the Europe they had left behind. European cafes in south eastern Australia had endless access to good milk, eggs and other ingredients and hence the emergence of the Flat White. Initially this was simply the European interpretation of what many Australian families drank at home, instant coffee with a bit of milk, and certainly if you walked into a coffee shop in Australia in the seventies or eighties thats what you got, espresso in a cup or glass typed up with hit water and some milk to resemble a homemade instant coffee with milk. Slowly but surely though the flat white got milker and stronger. The milk used was heated to keep the same drinking temperature of around 85degrees but without the deliberate froth topping and chocolate of it's cousin the cappuccino. Today the flat white is fast becoming an Australian iconic export with coffee shops throughout the world seeing this as a standard drink of self declared coffee officiados. I'm glad it's reached Singapore with ice style and panache in the last few years. Thanks oriole for making my da

Thought I would take a client here earlier this week as I was impressed by the menu and the location was good.Firstly, I walked in and asked the waiter whether they had wifi. He told me yes and promptly walked away without giving me the password. I then had to ask the barista who was the only friendly and competent person in the place who provided me with the details.Then I waited for about 15 minutes for someone/anyone to offer me a drink. Eventually a pleasant but slow waiter got me a sparkling water.Finally my client arrived and I ordered the burger lunch special and she chose the fish and chips. I was advised by another different and not as pleasant waiter that the chef would cook this medium which I was fine with. My burger was raw (even my client commented on it) and the fish was dry.Needless to say I won't be rushing back anytime soon unfortunately

Came here with a friend on the weekend for a cold pressed juice and a coffee. The juice was ok but nothing special for the $8++ charged. The coffee was good. Atmosphere was reasonable although the outside area is somewhat spoilt by people smoking
3
With so many places to choose from, how do you narrow it down?Luckily, I was with a friend who lived in Singapore, so, this was her suggestion.Definitely wasn't disappointed.We chose to sit inside, but, moved outside as it was a bit too cold indoors. Outside was pleasant, and you did get to see a little of the world go by as there is a foot entrance to the shopping centre at Orchard Gateway, the Somerset station.While they don't do Chai Latte (insert sad face), they did an excellent coffee milkshake. At SGD9, it probably was overpriced, but, I certainly enjoyed it. Hey, I was on holiday.Like other places in Singapore, my friend's cappuccino was served in a glass very reminiscent of a latte, so, don't be fooled with the presentation.Breakfast was until 6pm, so we certainly had plenty of time to get our eggs ordered before then.My friend ordered a 2egg 2muffin deal (yes, Benedict) with extra mushrooms.I opted for the eggs and lamb stew baked in a frypan - Humble Baked Egg Skillet... definitely wasn't expecting the 3 eggs that it came with though.My meal was a little liquid-like based on the egg and stew combination, so I did ask for bread, which was extra. You definitely needed something to eat the entire meal with as a knife and fork just wouldn't cut it (pun intended). I was offered a spoon, which would have been a much better utensil to be given than the knife.A recommendation to the house would be to serve that meal with bread or a bread roll as it definitely needs it.A little strange with the service, but, my friend responded that it was very much the Singapore way... depends on where you go, and which waiter you had.That said, it wasn't bad service, and I would definitely go there again.What intrigued me was the beverage named "Death Cream". I definitely want to try that, especially as vanilla and cream are two of my favourites, and mixed together, heavenly (perhaps a little too heavenly).Not a cheap place, but then, neither is Singapore, so, it was probably a standard cafe breakfast expense.Want to go back and try a different menu next time as I did like this cafe
5
This place is a gem. It's hidden right outside one of the malls on Orchard Road. We found it because it was one of the few places that was open before 10am. Loved it so much that we went back two days in a row! I highly recommend the (non-alcoholic) espresso drink that is served in the martini glass.. yum!!
4
This is a rare place in city centre where you can find beer, coffee and yummy desserts at one place and serving until past midnight on weekend.They have couple of draft beers available including Kronenbourg 1664. The coffee is good too. Was craving for late night dessert so ordered Miso Waffle (yes Miso as in Japanese miso!) as recommended by the waiter. It was delicious. Would repeat order on next return. Too bad the cajun chicken wasn't that good since they used powder cajun thus the taste was pretty artificial. Overall price was OK, medium high. The good thing there was promo on bottled beer, buy 3 for less so was pretty good value
4
Nice place to have a few drinks after work. They are on happy hours everyday, till 9pm. Vegetarian food menu can improve
4
Excellent Egg Skillet with lamb stew and emmental cheese. Anthony and his team are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back.
2
We were the first customers this morning. Carol smiled and showed us in. Then everything else failed. The order take was stern and lethargic looking despite our "Good morning!!". We had to collect our own ice water. We had to ask for cutlery. We have to ask for creamer..No smiles. The two eggs two muffins was accepted except that it is two half muffin. The burrito was good. That's the saving grace. Sincere smiles, attentive service and warm greetings should be added ingredients besides food to entice me to visit here again.
4
My husband and I ordered 1 salad, 2 mains and our total bill was $64 after a 10% credit card discount. The beef cheek tagliatelle had generous servings of beef and seafood risotolle was flavourful and also had generous servings of seafood. Nice ambience and service. I'd choose this anytime over snobbish place PS Cafe Petit (comparing because I visited these 2 restaurants in a week)
4
The location is convenient, close to the Somerset MRT. The happy hour drinks of 'buy one get one free', is a good incentive to catch up with friends prior to heading home on the MRT. I have been there a few times but forgot to review them. I found the staff friendly and the service was good
3
We came here just for some drinks. It was Friday night so the place was understandably crowded. I went for their Iced Tea and it was too sweet for my liking. We also ordered coffee with the M.A.D. milk option. That's quite something different. If you're lactose intolerant maybe you can try this out as they used macadamia and almonds nuts with dates to make it
4
We only had dessert here and I can only comment on that. The chocolate fudge cake was rich and good. Waffles were good too, but they're more the thin and crispy variety, not the thick and fluffy type. Accompanying butter scotch sauce was very good. Service on a busy Saturday night was decent.
4
Although the cafe cum bar opens until late night, we almost always patronize for brunch or lunch, not dinner. It has a hip kind of feel to its decor and I like the way they attend to the details, from the simple but stylish menu to the fonts on the table numbers.Their non-alcoholic drinks are limited in choices but do have enough to cater to the caffeine seekers. If you felt like trying something new, do give their M.A.D. Milk a go - this is a dairy free nut milk pressed from macadamia, almond and dates, hence the name.Oriole has a limited choice of hot meals and they are not economic for a frequent visit. Despite the limited choices, most of their dishes are of superb taste, some of them so addictive that you really want to ask how they make it. Some of our favorites are Capelinni Crabmeat and St Louis Pork Ribs. I am also biased towards theirFully Loaded, which got me hooked with its amount befitting the name of the meal. This is truly one hearty meal for a foodie
2
Its a tough one. Bad after little deliberation the following summarises my two visits here:1. BREAKFAST:THE GOOD:- The coffee- I like the M.A.D milk option if you're looking for something dairy and lactose alternative.THE BAD:- The service, horrific!!! honestly disgusting (but again the barista was awesome, the table staff terrible).- The environment: Cold and poor with loose strewn aircons blowing over the tables- The food. I had the full breakfast, and my partner had the eggs with tomato and basil. No effort in the tomato and eggs and the breakfast doesn't come anywhere close to whats on offer around Singapore these days. It may have cut it in the past but Oriole is lagging.2. LUNCH:THE GOOD:- The coffee againTHE BAD:- All the same, service a joke- The pumpkin and kale salad. I took it away since i was in a rush, but this was the worst attempt of any salad i have seen to date, with grimly dressing (i can only imagine Halloween contributed here)All in all there won't be a third visit, and Oriole needs to lift their game. Although with the amount of options Singaporeans now have open to them for a western meal i can't imagine why people still frequent Oriole

The worse dining experience I have in Singapore , No service and extra charge food item without serve , celebrate my husband birthday with terrible service , side table wine glass suddenly broken the red wine spout to my bag , No 1 come to help and service recovery , the more stupid is the marketing manager reply me the worse answer , explain to me the server and manager is good training and better monitor , Me and my husband and all my friend dining that all is the F&b management and Head Chef , How come u want to explain to us after we have terrible and worse dinner with cheat money charge , The marketing manager send me the $60 voucher to recover my $3000 bag and still don't admit what the restaurant did the fault , blame the guests break them self the glass , how come the guests want to break them glass to hurt the hand and spout the white shirt all thr red wine ! Totally worse ! I will share all the picture soo

Fried steak? Was expecting something interesting but wait... It's like pork chop. Skin was flaky. Truffle fries at SGd14 without the truffle taste without tr
4
Did brunch here. Nice menu and coffee. Ambience is great; enjoying the human traffic along the walkway. Outside area is a little bit hot for alfresco dining though.
4
Try MAD Milk, it is worth trying. it seems popular because when we went back to get some more it was sold out.
3
Service was super slow.... 3 meals bought out individually and the 4th never came at all. No communication about delay. Left before last meal came as 40 minutes post ordering.Cold pressed coffee was nice. Most expensive meal in Singapore. Wouldn't return.
4
They serve good food and great service. Relaxing ambience to catch up with friends.
Ribs and coffee milkshake are great.
2
Orioles advertises opening time of 8am on both the front door and restaurant. We turned up at 8am one day and the staff were there but advised they did not open until 8.30am.Went today for breakfast at 8.30 and they didn't have orange juice so my colleague went outside to buy an orange juice to have with breakfast (not an unreasonable thing to do if the place does not have it). He was told quite bluntly by the staff member that he could not bring outside drinks in. Not a good thing to do if you want to retain customers for future. I felt very uncomfortable being in that situation.The food was okay but the service made the experience very ordinary and uncomfortable.Don't bother with this place
3
Heard of some good review on this place. But unfortunately Had problems with the small space, the guest in the next table kept bumping into me. So did the service staff when they were delivering food to tables past me.Ordered flatwhite and reuben which was the beef sandwich with saukraut and mustard and cheese. The sandwich was nice but it would be better if they have non fatty beef. Salad was ok although abit oily. The taste would be elevated with balsamic vinegar. The fries were tasty but it was a bit soggy. My friend had the fully loaded breakfast and she was disappointed with it. Toasts were half burnt, sausage were dry and not appetising. My flatwhite tasted abit bitter as though the beans were slightly burnt. It was also abit too watery.Overall, i was quite disappointed
4
Tried the ribs, which were properly made and very tender, accompanied by crisp and tasty potato fries and an interesting dipping sauce. From this one dish, I was very impressed with the quality of the kitchen. The portion was on the small side considering the price, but this was OK for me at the time. Service is friendly but not very quick. Next time I might sit outside to avoid the droning Euro-trance music

We popped by the Oriole for afternoon tea, as that it was on our way back to our hotel from the Somerset MRT Station. Given that it looked like it was about to rain, we opted for a table indoors, but was informed that the air-conditioning was on the blitz. There was a strategically placed fan near our table, which made it comfortable, but seeing that, as we were told by the waiter, the a/c had been out of order for the last few days, one has to wonder why the problem wasn't addressed more urgently. Diners at several other tables did throw longing looks at our fan. The food was way below par when compared to the descriptions on the menu and the prices charged for the dishes. The kale & soba salad tasted decent, but the portion size and salad content was rather sad given the price tag. Come on. It was just a bundle of soba and perhaps 2 shredded leaves of kale. For the $9 price tag, I expect something more substantial, or at least a larger portion. The mantou sloppy dog was another huge letdown. The name and the description gave off images of crispy golden mantou filled with juicy sausage and liberally topped off with a slathering of sloppy sauce. What arrived were three rather tiny mantou "hotdogs" with a stingy smear of sauce. They looked pretty lonely on the plank it was served on, which was devoid of anything at all apart from the mantoudogs. Price tag: $15. The hotcakes, however, were well presented and tasty; the kids enjoyed this the best.And the coffees - we had a simple hand-brewed black and the coffee milkshake - were excellent. But the iced chocolate, not so much. Service-wise, we were greeted in a very friendly manner at the door, but it went downhill from there. Often, it felt like *we* were inconveniencing the wait staff whenever we asked to place an order or to request service. It didn't help that our table was located just next to a narrow service entrance, which made the dining experience unpleasant, watching staff haul stacks of whatnot in and out of the backroom, sometimes swinging their load almost directly over our food. Overall, while there were some highs to the visit, it was mostly a letdown. We didn't feel the quality of food or service were reflected in the too-high price, and ended up at the Ben & Jerry's across the way to make up for the less than enthusiastic "afternoon tea" at the Oriole
3
Nice sandwich place, very casual and with a good offer of food and quite good quality for the price paid. It's not exactly cheap, but it's in a prime position so I found the food/price mix correct in the end. We had a burgher and a BLT sandwich, all very nice and well presented. If you are in for a quick bite it's a nice place to go
5
Great service & breakfast! And coffee as well! Thanks, Bobby!
Fully loaded breakfast only at $20 and fresh avocado toast & salad at $14!
Best cafe on orchard ;)
5
I always pick up my coffee here in bulk to brew at home, I know they have another location, but I come here for the food too. The servers are very knowledgeable and eager to do their best. Great sandwiches.
4
Popped in for a bite.
Ordered the set lunch @ $19. The
Capellini crab meat - tasty! And it comes with free-flow iced tea, small green salad. Value for money right smack in town.
Will return.
4
Had a business lunch here. Was impressed by the food and service. Also had a coffee at their brand in Republic Plaza. Overall can see there is focus on quality and maintaining standards. Keep it up, will be back.
1
Didn't know they served a F&N drink for $6 bucks! Feels so cheated. Was going to try their gold moscato tea and they didn't have it.
3
needed a coffee to end a day of meetings and popped into oriole for a coffee. The service people led us to a small table in the corner away from everyone with was ok, we ordered a coffee each I had a flat white and my friend a latte, they came out very quick, first our coffee was not hot, was just warm if that. And the coffee itself tasted like instant coffee. Was a little disappointed considering it was $5
4
Went there with another couple for late brunch. The food is varied and tasty, the coffees are good. Pity they don't have fresh juices. Service is good, but if you're sitting outside they might forget to refill your water glasses a couple times. The prices were actually surprisingly not too high, compared to brunch places in SG. There aren't that many brunch places in Somerset station, so this is a great place to go
2
Dropped in for a drink and snack on the way back to our hotel Saturday night. Service good to start with but drinks and food all arrived at different times. The kids ordered milkshakes but first one arrived half full. We queried it but was told it was the new recipe which had more ice cream and less milk! Waitress offered to change the order which both kids did. The boys pie arrived a good 10 minutes after the fries. Paid the bill but waited ages for my card and bill to arrive back. Pretty average
3
If you order a bottle of wine for two it is better if you get it before not after food. Otherwise some serious drinking is required and kids need to carry home. Pretty Good bar food. Overpriced but this is Singapore so comparable. Service passable although fyi rose is wine not flowe
3
Was there for lunch with a client, liked that there was a set lunch option. Had a coffee before our meal. Nice blend of beans and good milk served with it.Food could be better but i can't complain much due to the cost of the set.. Overall, good place to hangout for coffee..
4
Great place for happy hour drinks. The food is above average with above average prices. Conveniently located in Orchard.
4
I've been here several times and always enjoyed the coffee. My favourite is the mint mocha. Today we tried the raisin scones with cream and jam and they were delicious!
4
From Melbourne in Singapore for a few days and I've come here 3 times for the coffee and relaxed atmosphere. Coffee is good by Singapore standards (doesn't compare to Melbourne) service has always been good and so is the food.
5
premium quality coffee, friendly service, very good location. we did not try the food but the menu is promising... definitely a go!
4
Tried this restaurant for a late lunch on a Saturday just before the official start of Happy Hour. As you can imagine seating was almost capacity at that point but we managed to get the last available table for 4. Drinks and food came quickly. The food was very good. We liked the fish and chips especially as we were in the mood for it. Waitstaff was friendly. Will visit again
5
We found this place whilst staying at the Concorde on Orchard Road and sheltering from the rain. A great place during the day to have a beer or a coffee whilst watching the world go by. We went back that evening for cocktails after dinner and finished up staying there until late and having more mohitos , coffee and ice cream sundaes. The staff are friendly and helpful, the place was packed with locals and tourists , groups, family and couples on dates. Would recommend and definitely go back

Located along the beautifully-lit discovery walk between Somerset 313 and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites are a row of restaurants and cafes. They always look so good especially at night, when illuminated by the tiny blue lights twinkling high above (in trees).We decided to give Oriole Cafe & Bar a try as it was empty that evening, and a male buddy recommended this place for its good coffee. The first dish we ordered was the Chicken Casserole, a piping hot dish that looked rather simple served in a shallow ceramic pan - chunks of chicken, capsicum, chorizo, tomato and toast baguette in tomato-paprika sauce. Casseroles are known to be very homely comfort food whereby one just tosses all sorts of ingredients found in the fridge and let it cook in the ovens. This was certainly comfort food, but a tasty one - tender chicken chunks amongst crunchy capsicum bits and chewy chorizo dices. The tomato-paprika sauce was thick and nicely-flavored, a perfect soak over the ingredients and the perfect dip for the hard-crusted bread slices.Then we had the Scallops Risotto - uniquely flavorful blends of large scallops, gentle sweetness of pumpkin bits, the stronger tinge of blue cheese (Gorgonzola) toned down by the herb-ish aroma of Balsamic glaze. Tender, chewy scallops charred to a smokey deliciousness cooked perfectly in chewy arborio rice, what more could we ask for? The slight play at food art was unneessary, because the colors of the tiny veggie bits had already piqued our appetites. Being an all-time risotto lover, this dish stole my heart easily too.For more detailed information and photos, do drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-oriole-cafe.htm

After trudging down Orchard Road around 9.45pm looking for a light dinner, and discovering that the mall restaurants were closing up, we finally found this collection of bars and restaurants above Somerset MTR station. Oriole was a good choice - a limited menu but good, enthusiatic and fairly quick service even though the place was packed. I had the king prawn risotto, which was very good, and my partner the chicken quesadillas, which were equally good. The Singapore slings didn't seem to have too much by way of alcohol, which seems characteristic in the city, but overall a good experience. And they are open until 1am
3
It is not restaurant, but a strategic place to have a drink after shopping. There are big fans above our head therefore it is quite nice to be at the terrace and looking people passing aroundTo eat, one plate can be shared for two people such as fish and chip or jamaican chicken with a beerfries are good Service is good alsomenu and carte is not big, but prices are ok, 22 boxes for chicken and fish and chip
1
We live nearby and decided to try out Oriole.Long story short. We won't be going back. Both our main courses were bland beyond belief. Nice location, good for people watching but the food really was a disappointment. Considering the menu is quite limited I was expecting much more.
5
So far, Oriole is on the very top of my list. Dim Lights. Cozy feeling. Good Music. Nice Staff. Sumptuous Meal. Heavenly Dessert and Quality Coffee prepared by no less than a Barista Champion. Definitely worth another visit!
5
I highly recommend the eggs benedict - delightful. The milkshakes are almost pure ice cream - great for a sugar boost and to cool down!
2
I visited Oriole on a Sunday evening many weeks ago.There were only a few tables occupied. Several diners seemed to be looking for service staff.I was left standing at the entrance for many minutes feeling like a silly owl observing the inattentiveness of the staff.When eventually I accosted a serving staff, I was then seated and to my pleasant surprise, the staff were friendly and politely engaging in a mild sense.I started with fish n chips. (I recalled eating here a year ago and enjoying the food).The food arrived in a basket, piping hot .. no, make that .. STEAMING HOT !! There were 4 medium sized fillets. The batter was a hardened crust, which when broken into exuded a release of steam !!! Ouch, the fish could not survive this heat .. the flesh was dry. All four pieces suffered the same fate. Chips were still mouth scalding for what seemed an eternity waiting to ingest my meal.Kitchen was closing so this was my only food order. Wow, so different from my first visit last year

Being on the search for a good cup of coffee in Singapore, we definitely had to sample Oriole's coffee. Charles said that their beans are known to be good. So, we waited to be seated.Oh, may I add that the hostess was at her very best! I've never seen someone so happy all the time at work and Oriole was packed. She was bubbly and never hesitated even the slightest when Doug asked for sugar. She jumped right where she stood and said, "Let me get that for you!" and she was off. One thing about Singapore that I love is their service industry. You hardly find someone who hates their job. Even when I was in Fullerton Hotel, the cleaner lady in the bathroom smiled politely while holding the door open for me and even when they chat among themselves, they spoke in such joy! I was definitely amazed. One cup of Iced vanilla latte (double shot espresso, cold milk, home - made flavors) for Doug. He loved it! Said it was really fragrant and it reminded him of Thailand's coffee where the coffee was sweet and strong in coffee flavor.One cup of Iced Cappuccino for me. Love it and the sun was blazing that day so I didn't have a choice but to order a cup of cold coffee but usually I prefer my cappuccino to be hot.Both cups were SGD5.5 each. Can you believe it! It's super cheap for Singaporeans to leisure in coffee while in Malaysia it's RM10 at least. Am comparing base on earning SGD and MYR.Charles decided to give their competition coffee a shot. He had Citrus Sin (double ristretto, spiced orange juice, steamed milk) and it came with a slice of orange. The manager of Oriole explained that the coffee is already sweet, infused with orange juice, so he didn't have to add that slice of orange or any sugar. He took a sip and savored the taste. LOL. When you're with Charles, you need to watch his expression when he takes a sip of his coffee. He loves coffee and would go all out just to try something new. Anyway, I tasted it and thought it was rather unique. Something like having chocolate with orange but the taste just went along with the bitterness of the coffee.More on my blog http://wanderlustbyjane.blogspot.com

I was at Somerset 313 a few days ago, and as dinner time approached, I decided to go Oriole Cafe as it was one of the few places that weren’t swarmed with people.I’m a seafood lover, so I was having a hard time choosing between the Baked Seafood Linguine ($25) and the Garlic Prawn Risotto ($25) before finally deciding on the latter. My mom ordered the Beef Cheek Tagliatelle ($22), a dish that I’ve heard many rave reviews about on various food blogs. We also ordered a Sticky Date Pudding ($12) to share.The prawn risotto definitely did not disappoint, with its fresh, succulent prawn grilled to a slight golden brown. The rice was very delicious, I liked that it wasn’t too soggy, but instead was very chewy. The rice fully absorbed the flavour of the rich prawn bisque. Don’t be misled by the photo, there weren’t just 4 grilled prawns in the risotto, Oriole is in fact quite generous with the prawns. There were more prawns chopped into smaller pieces mixed together with the rice.But unfortunately, the beef tagliatelle was a big disappointment. The beef wasn’t well-seasoned, and had a slight strange odour. I suspect that the meat wasn’t that fresh. The tagliatelle was also slightly sticky instead of being chewy and firm. Overall, it definitely didn’t warrant the amount of praise I’ve seen online.The sticky date pudding was a pleasant surprise, though. I didn’t expect the sticky date pudding here to be so tasty. The moist and soft pudding comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and unlike the normal sticky date puddings out there, Oriole’s version has rum and raisin added to it. The scent and slight bitterness of the rum enhances the flavour of the pudding, with the taste of rum lingering in your mouth even after you’ve swallowed the pudding. Immensely satisfying and leaves you craving for more. Even as I’m typing this post I’m craving for it again. This is something I’m definitely coming back for!Overall, it would be better if Oriole provided more choices for main course, because their current menu is severely lacking in variety. I’ll be back there for their sticky date pudding again, and next time I’ll also be sure to try their affogato that they are famous for

Coffee was great, not surpringly since the owner was Singapore's barista champion. I wold not have expected anything less and superb coffee. Food on the other hand was nothing spectacular. The fish and chips was good, crispy battered fish but not oily and tasty wedge cut chips seasoned with herbs. The portion size was Hugh. 4 decent chunks of snapper fillets. The braised beef cheeks tagliatelle was a disappointment though, despite some rave reviews over this dish. There was no depth in flavor in the sauce. In fact, the sauce was a tad watery. The pasta was cooked al dente but it fails in the sauce. What is pasta without a good sauce? Flat...if not or the pasta dish, I would have allotted the Oriole 4 stars. Prices were reasonable for its location
5
Food that we tried:Spicy Calamari- Really yummy and not as spicy as it looked.They have ongoing happy hour deals from 5-8pm and 8pm onwards, 2 for $22 cocktails. I had the mimosa and red sangria (tasted weird..i guess it was because of the apricot brandy will not order this again.)St. Louis Pork Ribs- Love this, it was a big portion too. Perfect with the sweet potato fries that came along with it.Jamaican jerk chicken- Huge portion of baby chicken tighs (!?!) but was too dry for my friend's tastebuds. Perfect for a date. Dim lightings, nice music and private space (that is if you chose the one by the mirror). Service was great
3
I came in on a sunday morning, ordered the full english breakfast and caffe latte. The coffee was not that bad except it seemed alittle over burnt. No compaints about the food quality, it was decent and nicely done. A few years back i had tried their fish and chips and it was one of the best i had tried. Not sure if they are keeping the standards now though
3
Oriole is located just behind 313 Somerset, along a sheltered laneway. Even on a busy day, one can sit outdoors and enjoy a coffee without feeling crushed by human traffic. Try the competition coffee. We tried both the Citrus Sin (coffee with orange juice?!) and the chilli chocolate latte (can't remember the name). Strange but good. Brunch starts from 10:30am on the weekends. Portions are generous. For the price and quality and atmosphere, I would pick Oriole over PS Cafe at the Paragon (another brunch spot in Orchard road) any day

My wife and I chose to have drinks at the Oriole Cafe and Bar only because the outside tables and glass picture windows looked friendly on a rainy afternoon. We did not know that they were well known for offering Kiwi blends of coffee. My wofe pronounced the coffee very good-to-excellent. The staff seemed better trained than the average cafe staff in Singapore, and they were quick to be of service once we got their attention. There are several choices of corners where you can find privacy, so the cafe is good for a romantic meeting over coffee. The cafe offers a good combination of location, friendly service, very good coffee and outside seating for visitors to the Somerset area and the Somerset MRT station

The hot cappuccino is always too cold. Not even warm. I have to remind myself to inform the waiters to make it warmer.

A very nice and cozy place to drink coffee. Had the competition coffee, something very different from other coffees you can get.

Nice and cozy place for a cup of coffee, lighting were a little too dim, but overall good. Prices are average. Haven't try the food here but I'm pretty sure it's a good place to hang out for a chit chat and coffee drink

I like Oriole, because its just so convienient for me to go there. The athosphare is fine And the service switched on. Food is ok but for their price level very good. I really love there milk shakes - so addictive :)

the "competition coffees" have to be tasted to be believed! I went out of my way to go back a couple of times they were that good.

My wife was craving western food, so I attempted to find a halfway decent place near Orchard Road. I do mean attempted, as the 3G connection on my phone slowed to a halt, so we finally resorted to looking at menus and guessing how close to the mark the food would be.I had a cubano sandwich, while my wife had the house burger with sweet potato fries substituted for the standard fries. The cubano was a pretty good approximation of the real thing and my fries were really, really good. My wife's burger had all the trappings of being a great burger--high quality meat, toppings, bun, etc.--but the taste didn't quite come together; the whole was less than the sum of the parts. I think, in hindsight, it might have been the condiments/dressing causing trouble. No matter, though, it was still a pretty good burger. The sweet potato fries looked right, had the right texture, and smelled right, but their flavor was a bit lackluster. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night or perhaps they just need a tad more seasoning. We finished our meal off with a banofee--good, but not terribly challenging to make. Oriole has a nice outdoor seating area that's both covered (in case it's raining) and has fans (in case it's an exceptionally warm day/evening). It's also close enough to the rest of the stuff at 313@Somerset that it has a trendy but comfortable city vibe. Overall, if I were back in the US, I probably wouldn't go back for anything other than the atmosphere, but on the other side of the globe, it's a reasonable facsimile of an upscale American style restaurant

I had the philly cheese steak sandwich. I have to admit I have never seen a philly cheese steak with flat steak slapped on bread with some unmelted cheese and some lettuce. Certainly not the traditional cheese steak one would expect. I ate it and it was filling. The fries (chips) that accompanied it were tasty and hot, top it all off with a pint of Tiger and all was fine but I wouldn't go back

Located in the middle of Singapore's shopping district, Orchard Road, Oriole Cafe & Bar is in a great location for shopping and people watching. The restaurant has a very relaxed feel and the staff are pleasant and efficient.In the day, the place is popular for beer and coffee. Come sun-down, the beer and wines dominate the drinks menu. They serve food as well but I have yet to try their meals.We had the Piccolo Latte and Cafe Latte and thoroughly enjoyed our fix. It's not easy to find good coffee in Singapore despite the many coffee joints around. Now we know one in Orchard Road that serves great coffee

I visited cafe oriole with my parents for a late lunch. The menu is full of western dishes - pasta, salad and more substantial mains as well as bar snacks. They accommodated my request to have something from the set menu and my salad was perfectly decent but it misses the mark somehow overall. Still a fine place to visit of you are shopping in the area.

The piccolo latte was awesome!! Must tries are the Fish n Chips & Beef Cheek Pasta. Nice ambience at night when the band is playing. However, service was not prompt enough. Had to wave a few times to catch the servers' attention. Barista stop work at 8pm sharp. So not a place for late night coffee..
