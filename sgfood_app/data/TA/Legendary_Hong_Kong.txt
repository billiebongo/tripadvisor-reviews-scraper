nice food and fast service! A good portion of food but still not the actually authentic hong kong food. The price is on the high side. However, overall experience was good.

Order the roast duck, chicken feet, siew mai and some others. Foods are average and there are many others on the menu, yet to try. Staff is quite helpful.

Went early and managed to get a seat. Food was served fast and tasted good. Tried the dim sum and other dishes. Milk tea was also good.

Ate here with my family. Food was average. Nothing special. Not worth the wait or cost in my humble opinion. Will not return

This is a good local dim sum restaurant. The atmosphere is that of a busy Chinese restaurant. The service is good and the food is good.

We were there for brunch on sat at 11.30am and was seated quite quickly. My sister and I ordered congee with liver, kidney, pork and intestines. It came in a big bowl and good for sharing. The congee was smooth with a lot of stuff in it. We also ordered the spinach dumpling with prawns. It was filled with lots of spinach and was very good. The turnip cake with XO sauce and the bun with butter & condensed milk were ok. The menu was extensive and is a good place to come for a quick meal if there is no queue

A noticeable queue during the weekend dinner crowd but the hostess was efficient.We ordered 2 types of Nissin noodles and the soup base tasted bland. Rice flour rolls were nice though not great. Prawn dumpling was substantial in size offering good value. Curry beef brisket had an overpowering spice taste which was disappointing. Though there were an assortment of cuts, the taste did not entice.Salty 7up was the savior of the evening - refreshing and flavorful. Overall, nor a value or treat.

We ordered some egg tarts, rice roll, prawn dumplings and a century egg lean meat congee. The prawn dumplings and rice roll were steamed dim sum, however when served, they were only lukewarm. The taste was only average. Congee when brought to our table was also lukewarm to our surprise. In addition, the texture of the congee was not smooth, and tasted very strange, quite floury, and bland, not saved by the addition of soy sauce. I informed the waitress about the congee, she acknowledged and proceeded to inform her superior. And that was the last contact with anyone until payment at the cashier.

Efficient service, delicious food. Of all that I ordered, I only didn't like the chee cheong fun 猪肠粉 because the skin wasn't nice. Would return again. Bill for 13 plates + 2 drinks came up to $76 after service charge & GST. Fed 3 hungry people very sufficiently.

Must try the 'bo lo bao' either original with butter or with pork. The taste lingers after awhile. Would definitely come back for another round of satisfying breakfast.

The food was fantastic and it really bring backs memories of my trip to Hong Kong. The decor was on point, making me feel like i was transported back to a cha chaan teng back there. 5/7 will be back again.

Had lunch with family recently.
The roast meat was superb and I consider its roast duck amongst all offering the London fat duck in Singapore.
Price was reasonable.
Menu was extensive.
Setting brings you back to HK...:-)

Average food with restaurant price. Nothing special. Roast meat, fatty roast belly, duck also with chunks of fat. Char siew Ok.

If you love your rice rolls with shrimps, this is highly recommended! The skin is thin and the shrimps are plump and succulent. I will order this on every visit and the quality is consistently good. I dare say this is even better than those served in hotels. Best part, you can satisfy your dim sum cravings at any time of the day

Excited to revisit after one year. The roast duck and milk tea were still as good. Tried new items (Bo Lo Bao with butter, stir fried beef hor fan, siew mai). Enjoyed everything. Just a small miss, they were not playing my favorite Cantonese songs this time

This is a char chan teng that has everything that feel like you are in HK. The only thing missing is the loud Cantonese conversion filling up the airwaves. The menu is similar to those in HK but includes a good range of tim sum. The quality of food and drink is just as good so if you need a fix for HK F&B where is where you want to be

Dined at this eatery for the first time last week, and I was totally delighted by the friendly staff service and the good range of hk cafe food choices. What's amazing about this place is the decor is so closely mapped to a typical hk cafe of old, that immediately transports you back to the 1980s in Hong Kong. Definitely full marks for ambience!Will definitely come back more often for meals here

Went to have a meal there after walking through the mall. Food was ok, hong kong style. Price was ok based on the food quality. Busy but staff very efficient and fast. All the food came fast except for dim sum which they need to steam

Had always seen the long queue outside the restaurant at Jurong Point NTUC Hypermart. Finally had the chance to try. Wife and I did not wait long in the queue. Business was brisk. Saw the roast at the front of the restaurant entrance. The decor reminded us of Hong Kong Cafe when we were shown to our stall seats typical of 'Char Chan Ting'. We ordered the breast portion of the London Goose. The meat was tender and fragrant. A bit oily for wife's liking but I liked it as the oils carries the aroma. We had the Char siew and roast pork combi as well. Was disappointed with the roast pork though - cold and some portion of the crackling skin was simply too hard to crunch. Char siew was better but I had better Char siew at other restaurants. We ordered the special dim sum fried prawn Chee Cheong Fan. That was pretty good with the crunchy prawn wrapped by soft smooth rice skin which gave different texture to the mouth feel. Service was prompt and waiters clear the dishes pretty fast. Will be back to try out other stuff on the vast menu

You do not need to travel to HK to find their cuisine. At LHK, this place you will find all you need to know about HK cuisine. Do order the meat platter, the century egg porridge, beef brisket noodle and wanton noodle.
5
I have not found a roast duck as good as at LHK! Also the dim sum and noodles are tasty. I have enjoyed every meal I have had here

I love the prawn dumplings and the 春风得意chee Cheon fun! fresh prawns and the cheecheon fun has texture to it when u chew it down! the decoration of the restaurant is very hongkong style and the staff are friendly!

Three of us went to the restaurant on a Saturday evening. We arrived at about 6pm and was seated within 15 minutes. The last time I was here for lunch on Sunday, I have to wait for at least 30 minutes. Our order was taken quickly. We ordered two wanton noodles, one dried and one soup, BBQ twin combo of roast duck and roast pork and rice roll with dough fritters. The roast pork was quite fatty but the skin was crispy, the duck meat was tough and fatty. We should have requested for the drumstick. The noodles were very good, but for older folks and children, please insist that the staff cut the noodles again. It's very chewy but delicious and the wantons were plump and filled with prawns. Together with drinks, the meal costed $52. A good place to have a quick and satisfactory meal

It is quite an authentic Hong Kong styled restaurant. The set-up, the way the chairs and tables are arranged and the waiters and waitresses all remind you of Hong Kong. The dishes are reasonably priced and good. My lean meat and century egg congee was tasty and creamy. However I didn"t like the you tiao which was hard and quite bland. My husband ordered the braised beef and white turnip which is his favourite, the beef that is as he doesn't like turnip. The wanton soup was also very tasty and the prawns were fresh and flavourful. Son ordered the wanton noodles soup which tasted just like the ones in Hong Kong.Service was fast and good even for non Mandarin speakers like us.I liked my drink which was honey with salted lemon too

Has been to this restaurant in Jan. Hidden gem in Jurong Point shopping mall. Quite authentic Hong Kong food if you like Hong Kong food. Try it's roast combination, wantan noodle and beef noodle.One of very nice restaurant to dine with friends and family. Decor very Hong Kong feel. Better than expected. Would rate the restaurant food better than Mongkok. The only shortfall - the bread not very nice. This could further improve especially polo bun/cocktail bun. Taste different compare to in Hong Kong

We will not come back again.The wan ton ordered was hard and cold so I dropped them into the little bowl of plain soup. I finished the soup and asked a lady server to add soup. This was done in previous occasions. The lady said okay and went to get soup for me. However she came back with a young man ( the son of the owner) and the young man told me they do not add soup there. He told me the next time he would not add for me. I called the owner and asked him. He said the restaurant will add soup and I told him what his son told me. The owner just walked away without saying further ; he did not even bother what I told him that customers cannot be treated like this . Of course he did not apologize. His an just laughed at the other corner signaling that what he did has been agreed by his father. We will not go there again and a caution to all that service there is bad and rude. In addition, the taste became worse with the hard cold wan ton.

This is a hidden shop in a huge mall. You need to navigate your way to Mongkok area and you will see the roast meat hanging near the front entrance. The service was ok, the portion was good for lunch. They serve a selection of HK Yum Cha food plus London Duck. The wanton noodles was ok, duck was also alright. Considering the price in aircon location, it's pretty good. If you prefer less frills, less selection, less pricy roast meat, you can ask around where is Lai Lai in the mall. They serve pretty much the same roasted meat stuff at same quality, minus the dim sum and service.

This place caught me by surprise . Most of the items ordered were good and tasted authentically Cantonese. The dim sum is a must order here. Mainly har kow, siew mai, XO carrot cake., plain porridge, wan tan noodles. The roasted meats were delicious. I like the duck and char siew
