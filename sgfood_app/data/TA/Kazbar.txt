As always, we will have our favourite cold mezzeh platter. This time around, we also went for the grilled minced lamb with tomato sauce which were excellent.

Good middle east food. It is my second time there. some dishes are very good. I will come back again one day
5
I usually go to Arab St if i want middle eastern food but a friend suggested we try here. I'm so glad we did as the food was delicious. A good size venue right in the heart of the CBD so there was a good after-work crowd. We had a choice to sit in or outside - we chose outside. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I've already recommended it to several friends
5
The food there is just sooo good, the Arabic grill chicken is amazing and there have a really pretty atmosphere and the staff were Soo nice, the managers were always asking about how was everything I really just love it Try the cocktails they are fabulous and the lamb chops!!!
5
Six of us had lunch here because one of the people in the group had dined there often. All six of us had different things - four from the set menu, two from ala carte. Every dish was excellent, and service was efficient without being mechanical. Staff were warm and friendly and accommodating with various requests. Set lunch is less than $21 - two courses with many choices for the main cours
4
The lebanese food is quite great in the opinion of the whole family, and coming out of the kitchen fast.Atmosphere I suppose is up to the individuals preferense, and service could be improved, but the staff is doing o
4
My third time back and just as good as the first two. This time was a business lunch for 6 clients although I booked for 5. The staff was accommodating even though the restaurant was full. Atmosphere was a bit casual for a business lunch but the clients don't seem to mind and in fact had a great time enjoying the food
4
Kazbar's service and food has never let me down. That is the reason why we visit them quite regularly as we always have guests coming into Singapore. Their grilled mutton and dips are a must order! However some waiting may be required when it's lunch time. While the service is always good and their servers attentive, long wait may be unavoidable sometimes during peak hours.
4
I had few options near my hotel on a rainy weekday and stumbled here with no expectations. The yogurt and cucumber was the best I have ever had. The kebab plate was delicious. Not overcooked. The rice was tasty but didn't knock it out of the park for me. But overall a very good meal. Service was bleh.. especially for them not being busy
4
I booked this place for dinner, and frankly wasn’t disappointed. They have an elaborate menu, ample indoor and outdoor seating space, attentive and friendly staff and good music and ambience. I liked the mocktail drinks I ordered, it was some Turkish lemonade or something like that. I live their hummus, and they have various kinds of them to try, with bread. Although I’d have liked my pita to be a bit fresher, or may be warmer. All the starters we ordered were quite good.About the kebabs, I find the meat in both chicken, and lamb to be very rubbery, difficult to cut and chew, which takes away the deliciousness of the spices used. Hence I wasn’t satisfied with the main course. I think if worked on getting good soft tender meat for their kebabs, this place could be more amazing. Thank you
5
This is my second time there this year and I have to say the food is consistently good. We had the set lunch this time iwhich was at $20++ so not exactly the lowest of prices but the quality justifies it. Also they don't push you to order drinks or bottled water so there are no hidden cost
5
Our friend who lived in Singapore recommended Kazbar to us and we are so pleased he did. It was by far the best restaurant we visited during our 11 night stay in Singapore. The food, service and decor was exceptional. We visited on our last night, we wish we had visited at the beginning because we would of gone back a number of times for sure. Wonderful restaurant
5
Just had a great birthday lunch today. Called from Malaysia yesterday to book a table and was worried we would not be able to make the 12.45pm slot as we would only land in Singapore around 11.30pm. Apparently on Fridays that is the latest you can book for lunch. Jonas (i think) who took the call was very understanding and asked us to call if we were running late. Thanks to Singapore efficiency, we arrived with five minutes to spare. Thankfully we booked a table! It was packed out!Service was fast, friendly and efficient, especially considering the size of the crowd. We were given a lovely table, which apparently everyone was apparently eyeing. Food-wise the cold mezze was superb. Couscous Royale was also great for sharing. Lovely textures and flavours. The hot mezze was also delicious. We completed the meal with homemade saffron and pistachio ice cream. What a treat! Looking forward to going again during our next trip. And we will definitely book a table
5
I tried Artichoke Stew instead of set menu for lunch ! Lot of vegetarian options and beer ! Fabulous location and good non inteusive crew 
5
We have been here few times for dinner (often our destination for special occasions) and every single time we have enjoyed the food and ambience. The preparation is amazing, taste is just finger lickingly delicious. Out of 5 time we visited in the last 4 months we have eaten most of their preparations and can confidently recommend visiting here if you like to enjoy authentic middle east food. Ambience is great and sitting on the sofa is always a favourite for us. Thanks guys for great food and awesome service
4
Haven’t been to Kazbar for a few months after going at least once a month and the food is always consistently good. Nothing fancy just a good honest meal. Hasn’t disappointed yet
4
Called for many veg dips, the pita and some salads too. Remember the full potions are quite large, half potions are good enough for 2 people. We had to doggie bag quite a lot of food and takeaway as there was lots left over when we called for full potions of salads, dips etc. Good food, will visit agai
4
Business lunch with decent food and service. Ordered mixed grill, seafood kebab and mixed skewers with cold hummus dip and pita bread. All tastes great especially the hummus dip and seafood kebab. The prawns were very fresh and fish was really good. WE were given a corner seat which was very cosy. We would definitely recommend and return to Kazbar
5
I had to write a review on Kazbar as it is the best meal I have had in a Long time. The service was quick, pleasant and friendly. The manager even leant my friend her reading glasses as he forgot his. The food was absolutely amazing cold and hot mezze were delicious! My kofta meal was huge and so tasty. Reasonably priced...I will definitely be back
4
We had the Grill Meat Platter which was really enough for 10 persons although the restaurant said 6-8 persons. Especially good was the lamb on the bone
4
Good value set lunches, fuss free. Highly recommended. Had the grill chicken and lamb stew. Must try the grill chicken.
4
We went there for a colleague lunch. The set lunch is value for money and quite a few selections. Foods are quite good
5
The food is superb, however because there's a bar setting just outside the restaurant, the noise level can be rather high. At times I had to raise my voice to converse. Nonetheless, I will definitely return for the awesome food but maybe during mon-thurs weeknights for a quieter experience
4
Lunch set menu's were a good choice and option for us to choose from. Food was tasteful and filling for a decent price. Good crowd and atmosphere. Enjoyed my dining experience there. Well done :)
5
Really enjoyed the shish kebab and joojeh kebab - they were very tasty and well grilled! Mixed cold mezze platter was delish as well!!
4
The produced use was fresh, there was dish which was served with fish and a tomato sauce which was lovely
5
Having an actual Lebanese chef does make a difference... the grilled meats are divine, the mezze (hot or cold) are worth the visit. I also love that Kazbar can cater your party and will deliver your food in very presentable platters. Easy and delicious
4
Was there on a Saturday evening, and the place was pleasantly 1/3 full, so staff was adequately attentive. Food was good quality and each portion was huge. We could honestly have done without the fries which covered half the plate and still felt that we got good value for money.The Baba Ganoush was yummy
1
They serve frozen pita bought from a supermarket , which completely ruins the taste of everything else. The lamb kebab was very raw and un-chewable
5
Superb middle eastern cuisine. Definitely worth a return visit. It was noisy though but then again it was on a Friday evening.
5
Staff was attentive and polite. Food was also served promptly. Loved the sourness of the lemon chicken kebab. Will definitely be back!
4
What a joy to be able to visit this place. We went on a Wednesday evening around 6pm.The interior was great, a nice outdoor area for people who want to mingle and see and be seen, inside a lot of nice separate seating areas, little nooks and corners. Great lighting.We had the mezze plate with pitta breads and also an order of falafels with a couple of beers..All the dips on the mezze plate were very fresh tasting and you can tell when quality ingredients have been used.The falafels also were superb.Service by Angela was tops.Thoroughly recommende
4
We visited Kazbar for lunch. They had lunch specials for $20 ++ which included a main dish and set starter of hummus and babaghanoush. It was nicely presented. I ordered lamb shish kabobs. They were about 5 pieces and served with yellow saffron rice. The lamb was succulent and nicely done. The rice tasted good too and there was a small salad on the side. We had a Turkish coffee for $7 each which was pretty good. The reason for giving it 4 stars was because it is on the expensive side with $20 ++ for lunch special (maybe they should include coffee). I would visit again despite of that
4
I'm definitely going back to this restaurant. The food was very tasty and the options of food on the menu is fantastic!
4
Love the cold mezzah platter here and that was what we came for... The bread however could be more fluffy and that would be perfect...!
2
Second visit at Kazbar. First one was average, this time was really poor. Terrible service by overwhelmed staff and plain food. Many better options next doors..
3
My husband chose royal couscous and I took the vegetarian couscous. The food was very good but the music was too loud and the place is very noisy. We were outside. If you go there with some friends outside is a good choice, however if you come with your beloved inside is much better.
4
We had a great dinner at Kazbar last night. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it! We particularly loved the mixed grill and the merguez sausage, but honestly everything we had was delicious. My only criticism would be that the pitta bread would have been nicer if it was hot as it wouldn't have been as dry, but other than that, we really enjoyed it and we are looking forward to going back. Also, their Espresso Martini is fantastic
4
One of the best places to have middle eastern food in Singapore. Very close to Samsung hub. The food is simply amazing and very nice ambience. Service could have been better. The taste and quality of food is what makes the difference. They have different kinds of middle eastern cuisine an especially Iranian which is not easy to get: We tried the falafel and the chicken kebebabs. The sitting is both indoor and outdoor. I visit them every time I am in Singapore and I would go back again
5
Went there twice. Once for lunch and once for drinks after work. Ordered set lunch and their lamb was simply great! It was fragrant and cooked till the meat was very tender. There was no weird smell from the pieces of lamb at all and the potion of the food was large. Nonetheless, I wiped out the whole plate of rice and lamb because it was too good! The chilli was also very special and I believe it's their special own creation! Drinks wise I find that they have a large variety of interesting drinks to choose from and I especially love their rose drink and lychee mojito. Simply refreshing, tasty and thirst quenching! I would definitely recommend this place for the great food and drinks. Lastly? Their service is commendable. While we were there during peak hours, they were still able to attend to us as soon as they could and made sure that we were well fed and had our drinks ready anytime!
4
Our dining at the Kazbar last Saturday was good so far as the meats was concerned. However I must point to the Pitta Bread being atrocious. Was served cold, flat and it was tough to even break it leave alone chew it well. Felt like a piece of soft fine leather in the hands!. The chef clearly is adept at meats, but needs a crash course and urgent help in making good pitta bread and served warm if not hot. Robs the fun out of what was an excellent Hummus.
4
Been to this place many times for business because it was convenient for me, menu does not change much, service is good , nice sitting inside. The Arab burger is Ma favorite, their lamb kebabs are good as well. There is a lunch menu at 20+ SGD which comes with homemade pita and a delicious homemade hummus. Not the best Greek in town but good for lunch
5
Kazbar accommodated my huge crowd with ease and the food was great. Friendly staff and accomodative chef
4
The restaurant was appropriately designed to bring out the Arabic theme. The staff were attentive and patient in explaining the signatures and menu to patrons. service was great and food was great too! Tried the pita bread wraps- was delicious! Would return again to try other items on the menu.
3
Always enjoy the food at Kazbar especially the starters, However during this lunhc visit all the meats were overcooked. Service still excellent but food has to deliver, New chef
4
A great find recommended by a local. The food was delicious, beautifully presented and service was great. Would recommend highly.
4
We went to this bar for a few drinks and some light snacks. We were really surprised with the delightful food that arrived. So fresh, so well done so tasty. It was such a pleasure, I am planning to go back. That tells a lot in this city with such good food. Worth a try.
5
Went there with a group from work. Mezze plate for 2 easily served 4. Everything was fresh, very well presented. Range of people on our table (vegetarians etc) and everyone very well satisfied. Would go back for sure
5
The place was cozy and perfect for a small group to catch up. We ordered the cold mezze platter, prawn kebabs and chicken with rice to share among 3 girls. The food was flavourful and delicious.
4
Came back here this week with some friends for a Friday lunch. Service was good and the selection of food decent. This time I opted for the artichoke stew which was actually pretty good. Certainly worth another visit
3
Authentic food served in a no fuss environment. Nothing fanciful, everything with local taste and not painful on the wallet.
5
Food was yummy and served warm. Restaurant was also very nicely decorated. Use your entertainer vouchers here for added value
2
More of an after work drinking place than a proper restaurant. Drinks are good, but alas the kebabs and lamb chops we had were too dry from burning. Indoor dining room is a bit too dark, more lugubrious than romantic though
4
A few colleagues and I wanted to head out for something a bit different, but we wanted to stay relatively close to the office, so we decided to check out Kazbar. They specialize in Lebanese food and Middle Eastern specialties, and the food is satisfying and well seasoned, with a very good variety for both meat and veggie lovers. We started with the Mixed Cold Mezzeh, a combination of hummus and tabbouleh served with delicious pita bread. After that, we got the Mixed Grill Platter to share with juicy lamb chops, chicken and a few glasses of wine. The whole thing was laid back, delicious, and quite well priced! Finally the Namoura ice cream was perfect to end up the diner with its piece of coconut cake and its surprising freshness. Itâ€™s definitely a place where I will be a regular, and I hear their lunch menu is good too
4
Food is good, service is good and staff is warm and efficient. Some dishes, especially kebbabs are very good. Worth tryin
3
Almost 64 SGD for 2 set lunch + 2 coffee. I found that quite expensive. and with such price, perhaps the quantity could be more generous
5
The place nailed it for us. Subtled-Volume Arabic music, Great deco, AWESOME service (call out goes to Hansel) & Food that needs a separate commendation. We were very skeptical as its in the CBD but for old time sake- we decided to try it out. We started with the humus (they have 3 types),Babaganoush and Chicken Shish. Flawless and the meat was tender & soft (this is rare as its breast meat). Then we ordered the seafood tahini dish along another Haloumi dish. The haloumi was great BUT the seafood was OUTSTANDING. Hansel was always on hand and very helpful - this is also very rare. We'd be back for sur
4
Kazbar offers good Middle Eastern food. The set lunch consists of a starter and a main, portions are generous. Waiting time was short and taste good. A restaurant that suits vegetarians and non- vegetarians alike.
4
The best lunch in cbd..they have amazing set lunch menu which is 20++.being a vegetarian I ordered falafel burger which is very tasty very crisp served hot with salad and fries..very spacious place to dine here with colleagues friends or family..the staff is very helping and active to guide u.a large vegetarian menu to help fellow indians like me..will visit agai
5
we had MIXED COLD MEZZEH (V)homemade,dips hummus,moutabel,mohammarah,babaganoush and tabouleh ,they serve very good falafel and sweet made of rice ,they also serve potato baked dish called MOUSAKA (V)oven baked layers of aubergine,potato, capsicumand onion in amiddleeastern tomato saucewith mozzarella gratin ,best dish which i never ha
3
While there are many places to drink in the area this place does have some discounts - if you have friends that work at Bloomberg they get discount here so come with them for a drink.
4
One of my favorite restaurants around CBD that is good for leisure and business dining. Middle east cuisine served are always fresh and delicious
3
Great atmosphere with almost authentic middle eastern style decoration and food preparation. But I dare say there are better outlets around in Singapore. I do sense that this place is more of a watering hole or a chill out after work / drinks with friends/colleagues kind of place. That said the drinks were a little watered down too
5
Visited KAZBAR with family and my 2 yr old daughter for a weekday lunch. There was ample space and the staff was helpful in setting up a table for us. Food portions are large and we loved the mezze spread. Service was good. Recommended if you are in the area
4
I've been a few times with different people and I have always enjoyed it. My guests from the Middle East enjoyed it too. Service is on par with the area, but can be a bit slow during peak lunch hour when taking the order. Food arrived quick and good. I'll be going back with the family as well.
5
Location:A really good location and it is just 2 minutes walk from Telok Ayer Train Station (Blue line - Downtown Line).Been here a few times already and still the food is good I have to say. Food standards are pretty consistent. Good job to the chefs!Food:The last i visited we tried the Kofta Dijaj (Minced Chicken) and Mix Kofta Kebab (Minced Chicken & Lamb). Feedback from my group of friends were awesome!The meats are all tender and the lamb do not really have that stinky smell. The pita bread with the dips (Hummus Dip) are really good! A must try.Other than dining there, it is a good place to chill for drinks too. Have both indoors and outdoors.Best is to make a reservation before heading there.Service of Staffs:Great! No complains
3
Popped in here for lunch today and opted for the couscous. Large portion of food: no issues with being hungry afterwards. Friendly and efficient service
5
Delicious food, with a real Lebanese chef in the kitchen, lovely area of town and super friendly staff. The babaghanoush, chicken kebab are my favorites. Kazbar is also my go to catering for house parties. They will deliver in very nice plates that can be just put on your table. Love it
3
Lunched with colleagues at this place. All of us liked the food. I had the lamb kebab which was nice. They have a special lunch menu, the dinner menu looked a bit on the expensive side.
5
I celebrated my 50th birthday here with family and friends on 18 june 2016 and it was a second to none experience. Let's start with the team.. The staff not only looked after our guests but took the effort to organise my presents. Make sure I guests never ran dry.... and be part of the team with the master planner (my dear wife) who has nothing but the best to say.The food was excellent..The mixed grill my favourite..and there were also ample vegetarian options that were seperate so the vegetarians amongst us were also well taken care of.A deejay was organised with an awesome selection of music that kept the young and the young at heart busy on the dance floor created. It was memorable evening of song and dance...and with the help of friends..family and the team at Kazbar..led by Angeles..Our friend... it was an occasion I cannot forget.Thanks and I'd also recommend this spot for romantic dinners.. The set up is unique and offers a very special middle eastern ambience in cosmopolitan Singapore
4
Extensive menu. Food was delicious, well presented and served quite quickly. Handled a large group very well.
4
The food is good here. Nice atmosphere. Their lamb dishes are great - very tender and tasty. Worth a visit.
1
The food was terrible and the service even worse, and the manager too rude to even speak to us or offer a change of order. Not recommended unless you are after a quick bee
5
im such a picky eater when it comes to Lamb but Kazbar has a good one! Texture is just nice with the right amount of spice. love it! What i love most, they have San Miguel Light! a new place i will sure keep visiting with friends :
4
Have lived in Singapore for over a year and only just found Kasbar. Great vibe happening on a Friday lunchtime and obviously popular with people from nearby offices as it cleared out quickly around 2pm. Loved the tiled tables, ambience and excellent value set lunch
5
I love the chilli fries, hummus and chicken wings. Addictive, especially the fries!The place is cosy and quiet. It is our usual haunt at the end of the day. Can be a bit crowded on Friday evenings!Service is warm and friendly.
2
It's not Lebanese food. There was no authentic flavor, I really didn't even want to eat it but it's expensive so I felt like I had to. Only business men go there after work to drink beers
5
Friendly service with great food. Couldn't ask for any more in this central location. We had mixed cold mezze and a few main courses and enjoyed every dish. Hope to return soon. Thanks
4
We went there on Friday evening - the food was very good, we were sattisfied with the portions, although we took the starters (hot meze) and kofte for the second dish. Za'atar chips were very good and a nice snack to the beer, hummus was fine, but the hot meze were the bust (especially spinach borek). Service was friendly and welcoming. I just didn't like the noise and the music. It is always an added value for me when I am in the restaurant with the 'local' music so I'd expect some middle eastern sounds and instead of that I had an annoying pop music over my ear
4
Amazing food, big portions. Great place for big parties, but it's noisy and in the middle of a bar street, so don't expect privacy. But the food was great, drinks as well and friendly staff.
4
Decor and ambience is pretty dark and dingy. The terrace is non-descript. The food is awesome. There aren't a lot of Lebanese places in sg and so it's excellent to have this one. Shish tahouk is great.
5
Very good food, everything that we ordered the hummus was nutty and fresh, the middle eastern aged cheese was tangy and fresh and the lamb kebabs soft and delicious. The Lebanese white wine they have was great too
5
Great middle eastern food. So much food for a great price. The last time I had this type cuisine was in Morocco. The staff were super friendly and attentive it was a shame I had no time to go back before I left Singapore.
1
As I'm leaving the restaurant, I feel I've been robbed by a con artist. Worse lamb chop and shanks ever. Perhaps they fed us left over from Friday, basically what I'm trying to say is, i won't go back
5
My wife and I had been there separately over the years. Then we had a date night and really loved the food! Two weeks later, we decided to celebrate my birthday with some friends.Dave and his team could not have made it easier! While planning (during the date night), Dave already made recommendations for the food which were spot on, in terms of type and amount (okay we had some leftovers, but that was GOOD thing!). Everyone raved about what we had. The service was excellent! Angela was assigned to look after us that evening, but everyone, I mean everyone, from the bartenders to the other wait staff, made the evening memorable and special. I cannot recommend them enough!Angeles, who runs the place was also very patient with me while refining the details and my wife tells me that everyone made it easy to surprise me with the balloons and cake she had delivered. They even walked her and my son to the taxi (it was way past his bedtime).Again, great food, better service, and value money. What more could you ask?PS. We stayed outside as it was a lovely evening, but the decor inside is beautiful! Well be back soon
4
We reached at the mad office rush hour and the place was absolutely full, starts emptying at about 2pm, so book a table in advance! We ordered a falafel, fatoush, hummus and a yummy lichi mint drink. All served competently by Rovi. The friendly manager/owner Angelis, stopped by a few times to see if we were happy with our meal. Please do increase your potion size of the dips, like when we called for the large Hummus, we actually thought we had been served the small one! It was a pretty small potion. Food was good, great tasting
3
Had a chance ti visit kazbar for dinner. It was situated in a lane full of bars and restaurants in the business area. The area was quite lively with lots of people sitting in the different restaurants, bars and cafes. We ordered hummus and tabouleh for starters followed by bar b qued Lebanese food consisting of lamb chops, chicken, and mince kebabs. Quality and quantity was pretty reasonable. For dessert had ummeali which was also ok followed by mint tea. Overall a nice place to visit.
3
Dear readers what makes a restaurant average? The taste of the food to begin with at least. So this place serves food with very average taste in small portions and high prices in a very nice location. I was sitting outside and as such i cannot comment on the decoration. But i can comment on the average service. I requested if possible to have my falafel served with hummus instead of the tahini sauce only to receive a no as an answer. In my opinion an owner should show some flexibility especially when the oil olive used for the hummus is the cheapest is the market with the characteristic poor taste. Well to conclude you do not need to be a rocket scientist to understand why this restaurant is ranked almost 40
5
Kazbar has really been there for ever it seems!Many years ago, many a Friday afternoon, slightly ahead of schedule started here.Yet, to be honest, not much more for this one. It all slowed down, the place fell of my/our radar.Then BOOOM it all changes, about a year ago, may even be less?A young looking and certainly dynamic chef walks in, Lebanese, seemingly.The full works, from the mezes, to the kebabs are spot on, made with passion.Smokiness of the starters, the aubergines and the peppers are a testemant to the passion in this chap's kitchen.Top tip?Just don't try the lamb chops if you like yours raw on the inside and with the mint sauce! More left for us, thank you ;)This chap seems to make the best Lebanese/Turkish food this side of Beirut! The challange is on :)
5
I love Lebanese food. And this place is delicious. We had the cold mezzeh which was great for 2 people and very tasty. Highly recommend. We also had the spicy calamari. It was average, but still good. And the cauliflower and potato stew which came with rice and a salad. Nice flavors.
4
We visited again recently with a friend. We have been here regularly over the past year. Kazbar never disappoints. Lovely starters such as cold mezzes and beautifully cooked skewered meats served by very friendly staff. We always look forward to lunch or dinner here.
4
Good food and good service :) the kofta kebabs are awesome !! The set lunch menu is great for a tasty business lunch!!
Enjoy
5
This is our go to bar for drinks after work. We always sit outside and the Atmosphere is great and staff are extremely friendly.
3
We eat out a lot, we travel a lot and we explore a lot... and this restaurant just doesn't cut it. It is average at best - more suited to 'after-office happy-hour' hang out to have drinks and small plates of unimpressive food to keep hunger at bay before you move on to better place for a good dinner. It is not somewhere I would go and bring friends or guests to have dinner - unless it is for lack of time or if I don't really care much where to go and don't plan to linger over a meal.Service quality is unattentive. Waiters walk around like zombies and make it too obvious that they rather be elsewhere. It is clumsy, unlively and unmotivated! Basically a bit depressing.This place was lot better a few years ago - the crowd, the food and the management and staff gave it a really good vibe - sadly it's now all faded and quality has decreased. There are better Persian restaurants with much nicer ambience and experience such as Shabestan in Robertson Quay
5
Great "mezze" style menu with plats ideal for sharing. Good hummus and dipping plate with hot kebab plate. Great place to relax after a week at work and listen to good music - inside outside options in case the weather (currently monsoon time) is not supportive!
5
Had lunch on a weekday here with the DH. We both ordered off the specials menu. It started with a dip or two - I know we had some hummus. Yum! I had the Shish Taouk which was quite good. DH had something on a skewer and gave me some including what I thought was a piece of red bell pepper from the skewer. IT WAS NOT A BELL PEPPER! And I ate the whole thing in one bite and almost caught fire. But the rest was very, very tasty. Both entrees were served with saffron rice and I think pita. I think we had Um Ali for dessert. It was a few weeks ago and all I remember is that even being brought to tears by the pepper didn't dull my enthusiasm for the food - or the restaurant. This is one of my favorite places on Church Street. I'm certain we'll be back
4
Best BBQ'd lamb chops in Singapore!Good locationIce cold buckets of beer!What else do you need as a starting poin
4
Visit this place time and again for some super falafel wrap. I dont know what they put inside it but it tastes just awesome. The ambience is smthg they have really focussed on. I appreciate such places that make you feel different not just thru their food but also by making the place interesting. Good for a drink as well.
4
This place is perhaps one of the best as far as Lebanese cuisine goes in Singapore. certainly a must try.Location is good - in the heart of the city - very easy to reach - just next to Telok Ayer MRT in Far East Square.the get-up of the restaurant is nice - gives a very middle eastern flavour. service is not very warm but quite professional. and now the food! wallah.... willing to go back any number of times to try the lamb shank on couscous, the fish & prawn kebab with garlic spinach and the mixed grill platter. each was beautifully done and leaves quite a lasting impression - each was quite exemplar. the rest of the food was very traditional and tasty. presentation is no frills - just get the stuff and stuff into your mouth and from there to your heart. a must try
4
My friends and I wanted to have Mediterranean dinner. We ordered mixed cold mezzeh (combination of hummus, moutabel, mohammarah, babaganoush and taboulehserved with pita bread), mixed grill platter (lamb chops, shish taouk, shish kebab, lamb and chicken kofta kebabserved with three different sauces (harissa, harissa mayo and garlic)) and saffron rice. We had a lovely dinner. Food is very good and highly recommended
5
Excellent food quality and value. One of our best meals out in Singapore in the last year. Hummus was fresh and tasty.
5
The food is great from their selection of starters to the main course. Best to visit at night where the lights are dimmed., you can feel the meditteranean vibe with the arabic music. Service is great. Will definitely come back.
4
We went there with a few friends and had a very tasty dinner with >20 dishes and each dish was a delight!

My wife and I visited The Kazbar on a Friday afternoon, at about 1pm. The place was pretty popular. Situated in Capital Square which has a large number of retaurants, one can attribute a crowded restaurant to high quality food.The moment we arrived we were quickly whizzed to a vacant table at the corner. The restaurant is well decorated to give it the Middle Eastern feeling. Perhaps it could do with a bit more lighting. We would like to see and appreciate what we are eating. We decided to go for their set lunch which cost $19++. The starter was a chickpea dip and brinjal dip served with pita bread. The starter portions were rather small. Then again, perhaps we were famished. However, it was compensated with the ample main course.We ordered the lamb dawood basha stew and falalel burger.The lamb was made into minced meat balls and cooked with pine seeds. The sauce in the stew was made from tomato and capsicum. The salad on the side had a lovely middle-eastern dressing that made the dish delicious. The rice was aromatic and mixed with vermicelli and is worth trying. The stew was OK. Not sure if the tomato and capsicum sauce came from a can but the stew had a slightly sharp taste.The falafel burger was nice and filling. The bun tasted like focaccia bread, which was great but a bit too much and too filling to have with the falafel and chips that came with it. The tahani (sesame) dip in the side when well with chips.One thing you cannot fault is the excellent service. The staff are friendly, helpful and fast! We did not have to wait long to be served.So overall, it was a pleasant experience, until the bill came. I was disappointed to read on the bill, "service charge included. TIPS ARE WELCOME". In Singapore, all restaurants charge 10% service charge and so there is no reason for tipping. Whether the service is good or bad, the customer pays an additional 10%. We do not have a tipping culture in Singapore

Visited Kazbar last night. I called the restaurant to check their working hours and made a reservation. So far, that was fine. Once I got there, had to wait for a few minutes to be seated while the staff was chatting at the back or with other customers. One of the waitresses passed right next to me and went on to fix the chairs! Finally got a table. The food was very good - chanclich and kibbeh, both well seasoned. But the service continued to be sloppy, it felt like there was lack of supervision, the touch of someone who cared about the quality of service. But again, food was great. So will I come back? Most likely, and hopefully will have a better experience with the service next time

I can gladly join in the praise for the lunch menu: S$ 19.50 will get you some hummus and baba ganoush, followed by a variety of tasty, authentic and - if you choose so - light dishes to choose from.Add some mint tea and it really feels like being closer to the middle than the far east!

Had an amazing fresh meal here one of the best for a long time. We had the lunch special and for $19.50 SGD pp we got some dips with bread followed by a main dish chosen from the lunch menu. There was a great variety and choice. Excellent value and atmosphere

We have been in the restaurants around Arab street and were always disappointed. We lived in the UAE for a long time and being half arab I love Arabic food but have high expectations. After online research we thought we give this a try and LOVED it. Food, decor, everything. The Taboule was PERFECT, baba ghanoush extremely good, the meat (especially the lamb) amazing. Chef (and owner?!) Kamal was very friendly, he worked in the burj al arab in Dubai for a few years, so no wonder the food is great and authentic! This is now my fav restaurant and we can't wait to go back

So Kazbar was already one of our favorite place for dinner (awesome food, great service) - we tried the catering service and guess what: just as delicious! delivered on time, perfectly presented in disposable platters. The selection was just great and everyone looooooved the food. Great job from Kazbar - we will use the catering service again for sure

Sought this out after good reviews. Was pleased by what we found but then came the lack of any service at all. Maybe a bad time to visit (2pm ish) but the staff seemed more interested in attracting more customer than serving those already there. We left and found a great place around the corner. I guess the morale is choose when to go carefully. Avoid peak times.

Food and atmosphere is great. Only comment would be aware that as food is ready it is served. Great area for wondering around.

We had a delicious meal at Kazbar, quite a hidden gem in Singapore. It is on a quaint walking street in the center of the CBD. It is quiet on the weekend, closed off to cars, and filled with charming restaurants and shops. We found parking and directions to the restaurant quite easy. It was not very crowded but still the service was slow. This is not unusual for Singapore, though the wait staff was friendly. The food was delicious and the atmosphere, quite comfortable. The hummus and tabouli were very good, as were the lamb and minced chicken dishes. We sat outside which was lovely and look forward to returning

Kazbar serves authentic Lebanese cuisine in Singapore. Food is well prepared, and tastes as good as what I ate in my various trips to the Middle East. Service on a Saturday evening was good, though the Shisha could perhaps be improved upon
5
The cafe styled restuarant has multiple seating options - the airconditioned low seating inside the restaurant - or the more casual outdoor table seating. The weather was good in the evening and my colleagues and I sat in the casual outdoor area clos eto the entrance. The starters were slightly oversalty/sour, but the food items were fabulous. We etour Lebanese friend to roder the food, but this is by far the best Lebanese vegetarian food that i have had (BTW - i am a vegetarian). And the spinach with yoghurt was very tasty, and so was the spianch and ricotta filled pastry. The beetroot salad was yumm. The baba ganoush was fantastic. And the desserts were brilliant. A definite restuarant on a revisit

I visited Kazbar yesterday with family and friends. The ambience was great and food fabulous. Great options for vegetarians and non-veggies alike. I had ordered various vegetarian options and falafel was the standout which was crisp, delicious and served hot with soft pita bread. My non-veggie friends really appreciated and enjoyed the meat dishes. Staff was kind and courteous. Excellent service and food overall. Restaurant was spacious too much better than the ones I've tried out at Arab street. Will definitely visit again. Certainly the best Lebanese cuisine I have had in Singapore so far.All the best Kazbar. Keep up your good work

We visited kaz bar in August 2013 and were truly amazed by the food quality and portion size . Having stayed in Middle East for some time and having high expectations of the food, I was truly impressed by the good and service . You could easily notice the owner going around the tables and chatting with people . We were fortunate to interact with the chef and he worked out a spectacular menu for us ( including Arabic mezze, grill platter ) the restaurant also serves Shisha. The hummus and the fattoush are very good . They also have a large beverage selection . Overall a great way to spend the evening.

In an unremarkable pedestrian street in Singapore's business district, the place looks like another bar. But pop inside and you'll find some if the most authentic Lebanese food outside Beirut. We got no further than ten mezze, because they were so good that we ordered ANOTHER lot! The service is charming and helpful, the wine list includes Kefraya and Musar, and the chef, Kamel, is a delight...wordly, enthusiastic, and 'real'. Go there

We loved the atmosphere and,of course, the food! It's deliciously authentic and the owner himself has middle eastern origins, so the spices come directly from the ME. We loved the hummus with the different types of dips and the shisha. Definitely recommend the shisha to shisha lovers.

Kazbar is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore and I try to go there often.It's a bit of a walk from my office but well worth it.The dÃ©cor is average and as with most restaurants in Singapore, lunch is best enjoyed in the cool indoors rather than alfresco. The service has been consistently good and if I remember correctly, they do not actually have a service charge.They do have a very good lunch menu that my colleagues have tried on several occasions but I am personally partial to the a la carte menu.The salads are great and though I've tried a couple, I prefer to stick to the tabouleh. This is absolutely the best tabouleh I've had outside Lebanon. It is consistently great. The ingredients are fresh and it is a refreshing way to start the meal.For the main course, I usually have the Sish Taouk. Again, this has been consistently flavorful over the last several years. The Sish Taouk is grilled to perfection with a amazing marinade that seeps well into the meat. I wonder how they grill it as I've never had the meat anything but moist. They've never overdone it.Among some of the other things I've tried are the hummus (excellent) and the Schawarama (only in the evenings on some days and not as tasty)When ever I need my dose of great Middle Eastern food, its off to Kazbar

Went and had food and drink. Lovely staff and lovely food. The lamb chops are VERY nice. I will be back. It's not the cheapest place to eat, but neither is it the most expensive. It is quality food for a very good price. I will be back

Set lunch for $19 SGD all-in.
Reasonable selection. Fairly standard fare without being anything particularly special.
Good option for a quick lunch.

It was good experience that would be repeated . the food was good , hot and served on time . Arabic atmosphere suitable with the Arabic menu proposed ( music , lighting,seating... )
Recommended to visit .

I ordered traditional dishes with Humous, and the food was delicious and yummy. Worth a try if you are looking for Middle eastern food. The place is little noisy and the setting of the place is more like of a bar than a restaurant.

Been looking a long time for a good Lebanese in Singapore, and Kasbar is the closest to my expectations. Worthy of recommendation.

As a recent visitor to this restaurant I was very impressed with the food and the relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The decor is amazing with lanterns and the seating area inside all fits so well with the theme of this restaurant.I would thoroughly recommend it and know I will be a regular customer here from now on

Been a regular patron for many years. Kazbar has kept the cozy charm and refreshed itself in recent months - subtle renovations, superb food, attentive & engaging staff and fabulous atmosphere!! It a great place for informal business meetings during the day and always has a buzz for an after work drink. A very cool hangout

the food is not bad... but am appalled by the service given to us... the Manager was very very rude! n told us not to come back

We had my husbands 50th brithday here with 11 poeple , we went in the day before and spoke with David to preorder the menu and he made a few suggestions without trying to make us spend more money. The food was fresh, hot, was delivered exactly when we wanted it. When the tab ran out they asked us each time if we wanted more, David did a great job at the bar and Michelle looked after our table and she know exactly what everyone was eating and drinking and topped up their glasses accordingly, is Australia that is expected, but is a rarity in Singapore, most people in singapore don't know the difference between red and white wine! Michelle you deserve a pay rise!!!thanks so much for an awesome night!!

Booked here for a Friday night with some friends and hadn't realised it was more of a bar than a restaurant - very noisy with pumping dance music! Breads and dips were excellent but we were disappointed with the falafel, chicken dumpling, cheese sticks etc as everything seemed to have possibly been from a frozen packet.would recommend for drinks and the a nibble on the dips & bread before heading elsewhere for main cours

Kazbar was introduced to me by a friend who proposed to his wife here! It is very close to work so I often go there with business guests for lunch. It is right behind Capital Square on Church Street. And the food is very tasty and worth the effort of going there in the evenings or weekends with friends or family. It serves a blend of Lebanese, Iranian and other Mid-Eastern cuisines. Vegetarians will not go hungry here and certainly not the die-hard carnivores! The meats are cooked just right and are flavourful. Many of the kebabs get served with a very nice, aromatic pilau. For dessert the Umm Ali and a semolina dish are great. Try a traditional mint tea after a meal which serves as a digestive. Their version of a Mojito, with or without alcohol, is nice to start with and a great cooler for the Singapore sun!If you are there for lunch go in for the combo meals which gets you a decent starter, and is good value. For groups, the mixed grill works very well.I prefer sitting inside -- there are alcoves with cushions, curtains and lamps like a tea house in an old souk. There are tables too and sofas that can accommodate large groups. If you want privacy and quiet for a conversation, sit inside.Angeles, the owner, is a perfect host. Her smile and care rubs off on other members of her staff
