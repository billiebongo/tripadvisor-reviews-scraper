Better than some of the others on boat quay. Cheaper, less crowded, friendly crowd. Good place for a few drinks and some pool.

Had a Department lunch and drinks there. Loved the homely chill environment. They have this weekly Monday trivia night that is quite fun. Do check it out.

The best place to come for a quiet beer and friendly chat with the bar staff.
Monday night is quiz night which was good for a laugh.
Loved this place and we returned other nights to enjoy.
Recommend.

Love this place. Relaxed and reliable. Good company, central location close to the office and local service with a smile.

Lovely little unheralded bar just one block back from Boat Key. Pool table, darts, wifi, friendly staff, pub quiz on a Monday, what more could anyone ask? This became my de-facto office during my weeks business trip to Singapore and I commend it to anyone who appreciates a proper traditional homely boozer rather than some of the 'Plastic Paddy' bar genre of which there were numerous examples nearby in Clarke Key. This place has real character which will be appreciated by those that like their lcal 'boozer'

I have been to most of the restaurants and pubs in Singapore, but first experience of asking for credit card to block the money. According to them that is their system, but system has worked only in my second visit to this place within a month. There are so many good places in same locality, so before choosing this place please have a second thought. Singapore is a good place to chill out, but not this one

Our Anna, the amazing landlord, has been making us feel more than welcome and part of the family for years and the fact that I have not written in to say thank you is actually rude, Anna forgive mePublic is welcoming and good old style local, we wouldn't change it for the world, and what makes it the special place it is, is Anna, oh and in my opinion the jÃ¤ger bombs, best I've ever had in the numerous countries we have been to and had a party, another drink is the springbok sweet but coolAnna, thanks you and see you soo

We stopped in here after walking around the quays - we were looking for something a little less touristy - and this place looked like a nice bar. We were right. Simon, the bartender, was great - super nice. It has a really easy-going vibe and they had great music playing. We intended to come in for just a beer and ended up staying for many more. It's a great decor, too, and they even have a little take one, leave one library there.  They have trivia on Monday, too. We wish we would have found it earlier on our trip

1st of all, I wanna praise the staffs who are helping out, they are really very very friendly and they talk to you for a while even thou it is very crowded! I love havin my bailey as the offer ends at 8pm all the way from 3pm in the afternoon ! They serve burger n fries as well for dinner and the fish n vegetarian burger is really delicious! Come in the afternoon just to chill with a book or browse the books in the bar. For travelers who love to stay in a hostel during their travel, this is a must go bar as it reallt gives u a hostel feeling when u r just walking outside the bar ^
