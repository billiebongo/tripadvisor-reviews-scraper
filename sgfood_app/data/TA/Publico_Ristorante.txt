I went to this restaurant with my Japanese guests.
The atmosphere was very modern and the staff were very smiley.
Especially Bettina's treatment was very good!
I love the pizza with truffle favor and steak were super nice.
You must try!

Time between ordering and the food arriving was just a bit too long. To make up for this a complimentary plate of calamari was served which was a lovely gesture.

I was impressed the moment I step into the restaurant. The surrounding was kind of cozy be it is afternoon or night time. The food was nicely prepared, well presented and delicious. It’s definitely a nice place to chill out.

This restaurant was beautiful, ambient and the food was tasty. However, the time between ordering and receiving was crazy. By the time our mains came, I was half asleep at the table - and we were late to meet our friends afterwards. We were given a complimentary bread basket and a glass of red wine on the house by the very friendly staff, which is thoughtful however they need to sort out the real issue - especially since other reviews tell the same story. I would go again but only being mindful of service speed

Five of us for Sunday lunch. I booked a table outside on the riverside terrace. The manager Shahie Jaffar ensured we had a lovely table and that we were well taken care of. Excellent service throughout the lunch, which really helped us enjoy the occasion in a relaxing setting.  I had some issues with the food the first time I came (a bit bland). But I was very pleased with the variety and quality of food we had for lunch. From the arancini and bolognese risotto balls, avocado and burrata toast to the two wonderful vegetarian pasta dishes, pizza bread and the steamed snapper, everything was delicious and nicely presented. The bill was very reasonable, too -- just over S$50 a head. Highly recommended

Amazing ambiance on a Friday night. Al fresco dining just the way it’s meant to be. Food quality was inconsistent - some dishes were so remarkably delicious that you want to come back for it (risotto and pizza), some is just plain OK (chicken liver paté, steak, cauliflower & broccoli duo). Portion sizes are probably smaller than in many other italian places, but I actually liked it - it’s just right to fill you without that feeling heavy. Overall good but is just a little bit too expensive. Prosecco (Bottega) at $14, was served in a wine glass, and the taste wasn’t good. I wouldn’t even put it in the menu.

We had dinner at Publico Ristorante after hearing a lot of good things about the place. The setting is absolutely stunning, with a nice outdoor area next to the river. We had various starters to share, including the calamari & cauliflower which were very crispy and tasteful! The mixed salad was okay, but nothing too special. We shared various pizzas, including the prosciutto and tartufata, best we've eaten in a while - very fresh and great texture. We'll be back for sure

We recently had dinner at Publico on a weekend in Singapore, and it was a wonderful evening. From pre dinner drinks, to the food and service, everything was impecable. The staff were attentive to all our needs, the food was authentic and delicious. The ambiance of the restaurant made our evening perfect and memorable. We'll definitely consider coming back on future visits to Singapore.

Great place to share a meal with friends or a casual meal with your partner. Really nice and casual setting. Food is tasty and can be shared. Pizza is delicious too.
5
A new addition to Robertson Quay overlooking the river where you can either dine inside or outside in the fresh air. Alfresco Italiano cuisine at an affordable price with direct access from the riverside walking path.
5
This is the second time that I have visited this restaurant and no disappointment at all, the service and food was just at the TOP, pizzas are the best in town. Will be back again soon.

We dined at Publico on our recent visit to Singapore and found this restaurant to be a gem. First, the location: The setting is a relaxing alfresco restaurant on the water's edge in Robertson Quay. Singapore can get pretty hot but they have plenty of fans to keep you cool. Second, the bar. We could not resist having pre dinners at the wrap around bar, with the great Italian classic cocktails prepared by a very stylish bartender. My Negroni was perfect to prepare my palette for the meal that was to come. Third, the ambiance and the food. The charming manager Shahie gave us a great table under a ceiling fan where we had a great view of the bar and the kitchen. We didn't have to think much about ordering as the staff do a wonderful job of suggesting what to have. We had classic Italian food at it's best. Nice tomato mozzarella salad, nice crispy fried calamari with a twist - some beautiful cauliflower. Followed by a nice bistecca that was juicy and tender, with what i would say is one of the best pasta carbonara i've had for quite some time. Throw a couple of nice glasses of wine, and bingo! You have the perfect meal. Finally, the best part of the experience was the wonderful staff, all extremely pleasant, engaging, and humble. I would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore because i can't wait to try some of the gins at the bar, and taste more things on the menu.

I would like to say thank you to Mr. Iwan & Mr. Ruzaini for their table service. Very professional. High knowledge of the menu. Iwan is a walking wikipedia! From the starters to the end he recommends impeccably. Good asset to the company! Keep it up! Although i had only less food today i am sure i am coming back for more as the staff is good and the place is awesome. I love Italy and this place makes me feel like it! LOVE!!!!

The restaurant location is really pleasant with a trendy atmosphere but the food was a disappointment. The bread was badly stale which is never a good start. Pastas were overcooked. The fried calamari was soaking in its dip which lined the bottom of the dish instead of being served in a separate bowl. Beetroot salad and cold cuts platter were ok but didn’t make it up for the rest. The staff was friendly but chaotic.

The restaurant / bar is only open from 1600 till 23.30. As it is situated on one of the most attractive spots on Robertson Bay, it is not only limited to time ( a morning cappuccino is not possible ) it is also difficult to have a drink in the afternoon on one of the lounges. 2 times we wanted to have a drink there in the afternoon, 2 times we were refused due to ‘ reservations’(..) Next to the lounges on the terrace is the restaurant. They had no one seated on those tables as well. The ( friendly) staff told us to have a seat at the bar. But we did not come to have a bar place. We preferred to have a lounge seat. It was not possible... As we came back at 23.15 to have a last drink on our way home, the staff told us that they were all ready closed.!!!!Not only are there a limited opening hours, even during those hours it is very difficult, hardly possible, to enter ‘publico’ .The place is new ; has limited opening hours and limited possibilities , even to try the quality of the restaurant and enjoy the atmosphere .The only thing you can do is look at it from outside.Not really a good start and not ‘publico’ at all.

Quick bite Sunday lunch / Brunch and were not disappointed.Pasta Carbonara, Pizza, and Rocket salad.We sat outside, in a very comfortable table that had a great veiw to people watch, and loads of plants.Service was great, attentive and pleasant hellos from all.It is worth the trip for reasonably priced Italian, with great flavor

Went there twice with my wife on one evening, as the location is nice, the place is new and the ambiance looks classy. The first visit for afternoon drinks was ok, they did not have the requested prosecco, but that can happen. Dispite plenty of space in the garden, we were placed at high tables as everything was reserved we were told. After us other couples and groups came in a were seated in the garden loungers. Not great but anyway, good for just a drink. In the evening after dinner we decided to go back and have another drink. Same story, the place was far from full and only place for a couple was standing table - no seats- as the rest was reserved! After some discussion we decided to leave. Well done Publico! Please go ahead with this behaviour and soon you will have plenty of space!Terrible service for a place with such a classy ambiance

My first visit after passing by a couple of times while on evening walks by the river. Publico has replaced the now defunct restaurant/bar 'Em By River' in the newly renovated Intercontinental hotel. From the design, quality of the features and the layout, anyone can see they have not scrimped a penny.. except for a few things which I will explain later. Walking in, we were greeted by two very pleasant and hosts who led us promptly to our table. The restaurant's interior is tastefully done. What i really like about the place is that there is adequate space between tables. Unlike some places where you can listen to your neighbour's conversation. Here, its just nice. Service was attentive, yet personal and really quite delightful that our server Danielle was able to suggest menu items that we could share as a party of 10 adults and 5 kids of varying ages. We were celebrating my mum's birthday. She quietly pulled me aside and asked if she can arrange a small surprise.The food was innovative and beautifully cooked and presented. Staff were knowledgeable and rather fun and energetic, it's lovely to see people enjoy their job! Food was promptly served and cooked to perfection. A nice selection of drinks were on offer in a lovely atmosphere. The pizza's were cooked in a open hearth pizza oven. Their pizza's are pretty good. Not as tasty and authentic as Pizzeria L' Operetta's at icon village but it can stand on its own. At the end of the dinner, Danielle and a large group of the servers came with a lighted candle on a serving of tiramisu singing happy birthday. That was a real nice touch. We ordered a myriad of desserts and the one that stood out the most was the vanilla and chocolate ice cream, believe me, you have to try it. Overall it was an evening well spent. Now the cons:1. Pizzas in general was great, but lacked the wood fired magic; the open hearth oven is a gas one. I was surprised with the amount they spent on renovation. They should have one. Pizzas just taste plain in a gas oven. 2. The mushroom pizza came with truffle oil that was overpowering everything else. The other pizzas we had were great. 3. Likewise, the mushroom soup had truffle oil in it too and i could taste nothing else. 4. Handmade pasta had a powdery texture. Sauce was delicious for both the meatball spaghetti and the cream mushroom pasta. I just wished the pasta noodles was better. 5. Food was slightly too salty in general. Overall, its really a great place to hang out for an evening or lunch. Service is impeccable, environment is phenomenal, the only thing that is keeping it from hitting all high scores, the food is lacking. I wish they will improve on the food as everything else is just so great

Loving the indoor and outdoor seating over here. Really satisfied with the food and cocktails at Ristorante ☺️
5
When to the ristorante a few times. The food and the people there are amazing!! Would definitely recommend others to come over!! Love the cocktails and the pizzas!! Especially Aperol Spritz and Nutella Pizza!!
5
Service was top notch, bartender was very smooth and have great knowledge in cocktails as well.
Food was mouth-watering, especially the margherita pizza was all too legit! will be my next regular spot for sure.

Publico is fantastic, a classy, attractive, modern, welcoming restaurant. From the very first moment talking to the delightful front of house lady it was going to be a nice evening. Nicely seated at a great table in the bright (AC-ed!) dining room my super friendly waitress brought me a glass of wine and recommended the lobster linguine. Both were delicious. A brilliant no hassle tasty dinner

Beautiful place, good service but not quite satisfied with the food though. Good potion but all 3 mains we ordered comes in tomato based sauce. Need to look through the menu properly the next time I guess. Will give them another shot.They prepared a small slice of tiramisu cake with candle for the birthday girl & that was nice!
5
Publico Ristorante makes a great escapade from the bustling city, the place to chill with your group of friends. Food -The Nutella Pizza makes a great deviation from the typical desserts. Can't forget the Cauliflower & Calamari Fritti - addictive! Aside that, service was top-notch & everyone was so friendly. Brought casual dining up to a whole new level. Will be back for sure

Had a dinner here last week, the restaurant look inviting with a green ambience outdoor, was greeted by a lovely hostess while walking by the river decide to dine in for a dinner. Chill and relax place at outdoor lounge. The service was great, attentive staff, the foods was good as well. a great place for gathering, with family and friends. Would recommend!

Very nice atmosphere at night. It is part of the Intercontinental Hotel so the prices will reflect a hotel restaurant (20 - 25 SGD pizzas). Service was very good, and food enjoyed by all. The steak I had was good. Should have had the tartufata pizza which is one of the house recommended dishes. Next time. We were about 10 persons, so it is a good place for larger groups. Nice open layout for both indoor and outdoor seating
5
Exceptional venue. Loved the pizzas, environment, the music, and the service (although some servers were stronger than others).Could not decide whether to sit inside or outside as both equally beautiful. Decided, in the end, to have some drinks on the river and then go inside for dinner. The staff was very accomodating and will go back for the food. Reasonably priced for the market

A Beautiful Space with Great Lighting, inside or out on the terrace too . Service was friendly and welcoming from the start to the end . Food was prompt and delivery well spaced. Great Bread n Meats , Good Salads and Pizza . The only Pasta we ordered was disappointing . Generally Heavy on the Salt soAsk for much less Salt on your food and it should be a Wonderful Meal .

I went to Publico early on a Saturday evening. I was lucky and got a seat at the bar! The restaurant manager asked if I wanted any recommendations and I'm always looking for them so I said yes. He recommended their delicious beet salad with goat cheese crostini (delicious!). I had a hard time deciding between the spaghetti and meatballs, which looked like he was going to drool over himself, or the pizza. I opted for the spaghetti and beef meatballs with a great glass of chianti to accompany it! I had a nice dinner with a lovely view as the restaurant itself is beautiful with its alfresco feel and light green colors! I can't wait to go back and try the pizza
2
Very disappointed that they did not see to have made any public/social media notice that they were ONLY serving pizzas and selected drinks on a festive day like Christmas. Easily dampened our spirits as my ENTIRE family headed down specially for this festive occasion. It is not difficult to post a notice nowadays so it is quite a questionable act on their part. Nonetheless, the servers were cheery and polite and pizzas were good. However their only smoothie on the drinks list was disappointingly unavailable as they ran out of bananas

During my visit to Singapore last week. We get recommended by our friend Andre to go to Publico Restaurant. Is a new spot on the town. The ambience is cozy and agreable. Since my friend make the reservation, The staff was very attentive by phone. We arrived to the restaurant and Mr. Shahie received us, I can say, thank you for be soo attentive and care about us. The food is good and portions are nice, they offer also cocktails, mock tails and the price range is good.We ate lamb chops, lobster spaghetti and sea bass. All was tasty and cook in proper way. I will come back to publico in my next visit to Singapore. Give a try to this restaurant and look for Mr. Shahie. For sure he will take care about you

Newly opened, spacious restaurant in the old Gallery Hotel. Loved the decor and open-concept kitchen. The dining area flows nicely into the large patios, which are beautifully lit up at night.  Great place to unwind for drinks and dinner. Which is exactly why I was there with a friend. Restaurant manager Shahie Jaffar and his team took care of us right from the start, helping us chose the wine (which was excellent), topping up the bread and discussing the dishes on the menu. I opted for the sea bass while my friend went for the lobster pasta. The quality of the food was good but I can't say it's the best I've had in Singapore. But the kitchen is new and will surely improve with time. I'll certainly be back as this is a lovely place to meet friends, chat and just relax by the river

We had a reservation with publico restaurant and because it was our first time there, walked into the deli/cafe with the same name thinking we were at the right place. The staff member at the deli told us "the restaurant is outside". We walked out and still did not see the restaurant. The tone in his voice then changed to one that seemed very annoyed "it's outside!" Turns out it is outside but you have to turn the corner a bit before you can see the sign. Well, both establishments say "Publico", no one told us there was a separate deli and a restaurant. Once inside, service and food were both good (loved the pizza crusts and tiramisu, as well as the unusual pasta beads), although they misunderstood about the water we wanted. Portions however were on the small side. My advice is that they clear the air about the difference between the deli and the restaurant and to show some patience to first time customers finding their way around

Cool new restaurant in Robertson quay with a great outdoor sitting area. Staff is all new or acts that way- provided typical Singapore semi-attentive Service. There are several really good Italian restaurants in this stretch of the river so they will have their work cut out for them to survive long term. Likely would only come back with a grou

Great restaurant in one of the chic area of Singapore. Italian food. The chef is Italian.Great service. Slow services but worth the wait.The charcuterie was excellent. My risotto even better for being in Singapore.Friend had lamb and was impressed.Great place for a good relaxing dinner

I visited publico with my Mother on a whim as we were in the vicinity and decided to visit after it was recommended to us by our friends. The service was superb and our server Levi was very well-informed of the items on offer. Apart from that, he was warm and hospitable and made us feel comfortable and welcome. The dishes were reasonably priced and we decided to try the caprese before moving onto the bistecca and clam vongole respectively. The caprese was excellent and the use of vine tomatoes made it unique in comparison with similar dishes served in other Italian eateries. The bistecca was succulent and we didn’t have to wait long for our meals to arrive. However, the best part of our meal had to be dessert. I ordered the panna cotta and it was out of this world!!! The intense and contrasting flavours of raspberry and vanilla were a feast for the taste buds. Overall, I had an enjoyable evening and would definitely return for another meal

Had a wonderful gathering with friends whom I’ve not seen for ages and decided to check out this newly opened Italian restaurant set by the Singapore River in Robertson Quay. Tasteful designed and curated with plenty of fond memories which dates back when it was EM Bar before. Great job!The service and kitchen team whipped out a fantastic dining experience. Will definitely come back again! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

Had a dinner with Friends on the recently open Publico restaurant, the restaurant looks amazing, the feels is relaxing and chill staff is wonderful, and food is what you will expect from a real Italian restaurant . Over all was a fantastic experience, will be back soo
