We went for the breakfast buffet and it was huge, delicious and very good sercixe service. It is pricey (as everything in Marina Bay) but in my opinion this one is worth it.

We were celebrating a wedding anniversary at the Rice restaurant. On our first visit, the celebration was made extra special by staff member Mr. Jonathan Mark Vierra. His personal attention to our party's needs was a fine balance of subtlety and grace. Jonathan catered to us seemingly exclusively (we weren't his only guests but that's how good he was) without being intrusive. His excellent level of professionalism and service encouraged us to return for a 2nd visit for extended celebrations at the Rice restaurant. We even reserved the same table! However, it was Jonathan's day off. While the staff member assigned to us during our 2nd time at Rice was professional and attentive, we did feel a difference. Jonathan's care and attention was certainly a notch above the rest and he was missed by our party. The buffet selection at Rice itself was impressive. There was something for everyone in our party. (We can attest to this since we went there on 3 different occasions during our party's short visit in Singapore!) However, we noted that the range of broths and soups offered were not vegetarian based. One of our party was perplexed by this. When Benjamin Tan, the Assistant Director realized this, he personally ensured that a delicious vegetarian broth was prepared just for our party. So while Jonathan was missed on this 2nd visit, we were encouraged to return a 3rd time. When our party returned for a 3rd visit, Benjamin spotted us and took the initiative to ensure that another tasty vegetarian broth was made. We were very touched and grateful for the sensitivity and care afforded to the different dietary requirements of our party by Benjamin.As anyone who has visited Singapore knows, Singapore has a wide variety of quality restaurants and much fine dining to select from. The selection at Rice is certainly exceptional and tasty, and much kudos go to the Chef and his team. However, the quality and standard of service we enjoyed at the Rice restaurant was the icing on the cake and did keep us coming back during our party's short visit to Singapore. Our recommendation: 5 out of 5 stars! We will be back!Our warmest thanks and a happy and prosperous Lunar New Year wishes to Jonathan, Benjamin and the MBS team for making our party's celebrations a most enjoyable and memorable one. Warmly & on behalf of our party,Mdm Mary Ye

Always kind of liked this place and went there for breakfast recently. We had some very focused service from Jonathan the head guy who told us the story of his ties representing different places that he had been. The waiting staff were less good.Despite being 5 metres away from a coffee machine it took them 30 minutes and 4 reminders to bring me a cappuccino. The second one came in seconds....The club sandwich was epic and overall the experience was good but if someone needs a cup off coffee in the morning you need to give it to them quickly....... The 4 stars are for the eventual service and Jonathan not the former service..

We were a group of 20 who had our early chinese new year gathering at Rise. Service was top and prompt. Plates were cleared once you are done. Drinks are refilled quickly. Kids friendly too with the outdoor area available for the kids to roam free if they get bored. The variety was also excellent for the price you are paying considering this is the upper end range for buffet standards. Chilli crab seemed popular with the tourists but being locals, we are not that excited over that. Other local dish was fried carrot cake and Hokkien Mee and laksa which was good. Wondering why there was no satay! The soda machine was fun ~ a friendly staff recommended lemongrass mixed with pandan syrup. Good choice! The lime Tart was delicious other cakes were abit on the dry sid

Oysters, sushi are pretty fresh for buffet quality. However oysters can be better shucked. I had a few bits of shell when I ate mine. The cooked food is great, especially the fish dishes. The prawn laksa also quite nice. Desserts spread is also awesome, ice-creams, fruits, cakes look legit, waffles etc. However, the Thai red ruby soup is bland and not sweet. I also love the DIY Soda stand. Interesting concept. Service is good and attentive, and ambience is nice, spacious and with lots of light. My colleagues and I felt the square table is a bit low to be conducive to eating but I’m not sure anything can be done about it. Overall pretty good for a buffet.

We went here for lunch. There are lots of dishes to choose such as Asian, Indian,, vegetarian, you can mix your own fruit drink, lots of salad, cheese, ham, bread choices, dessert too: lots of cake, marshmallows and a chocolate fountain. Quite pricey but I think for a one time meal it is okay. It was very crowded so the ambience was not so good

We had a great time at Rise Buffet at Marina Bay Sands Hotel last New Year’s Eve. This was a treat from my sibling so I didn’t really know how much it cost to pay for a buffet in such a grand location. Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the place to visit in Singapore and considering the price of this buffet, one would expect grand selection and choices typical of what you consume in other parts of Asia or Las Vegas style buffet.The selection of their dishes represent various dishes worldwide mainly Asian, French and Japanese cuisine with typical highlights on their prime rib, pasta and Japanese sushi and sashimi. Caesar salad was excellent with perfect seasoning and blend of the anchovies. Considering the Malaysian influence, the curries were not as impressive and the basmati rice being too dry and under seasoned. What captured me most are the mouthwatering oysters which by far, probably one of fresh tasting oysters I have tasted in a long time. The cook on the spot counter was amazing with risotto being cooked fresh inside a giant parmigiana cheese complimented by fois gras, topped with generous portions of black truffles. The deserts had the traditional Malaysian deserts which were all presented beautifully. I enjoyed the coconut milk desert but their cakes are not too impressive. The bread are not warm inside. Service is overall good. The waiters are friendly and continuously attend to our drinks anticipating what we need. The tables were decorated with simple touch of herbal plants/leafs which I think was too simple for a New Year’s Eve celebration. Overall, the food was satisfying and my experience was pleasant. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest, I will give this place a 7

I was here today , 21/1/18. I had a tried to go to Cést LaVie at the Marina Bay Sands to see the view but after inspecting their menu I refused to pay the SQ$20 P/P fee and went to have lunch here, a La Carte. We were pleasantly greeted and our concerns regarding quality of food appeared to be understood, and accepted. I order a 300gr Prime Rib Grain feed (@ SQ58) hile my wife order the SQ25 Prime Beef Burger, i.e. we wer both craving nourishment after 14 days in Thailand. I specifically asked if the prime rib was at least my thumb width (2cm) thick so that i could have it medium rare, i.e. 2 of the waitresses fingers, and was informed it was after she spoke with the chef. Also how the burger beef was prepared, to which I was informed it was cut and made into a burger in the morning and then kept semi frozen until required (after the waitress spoke to the chef a 2nd time). We subsequently went ahead with the order for both.Let me start by saying that the staff at all times were courteous, friendly and professional. The tables were clean and attended to. Cutlery and crockery were clean and a good assortment of bread rolls were presented.However, when my prime rib arrived I was surprised to see a 1cm slice of scotch fillet with a large natural fat blob in the center and extensive sinews at the sides, which I had lodged b/w 2 teeth at first bite. NO GOOD ENOUGH, but as it was medium rare I finished it, even if I did cut at least 1/3 of it away as waste. My wife's burger on the other hand had been so hardly man handled that the burger was too hard before being cooked, and was then cooked to within an inch of its death, TOO WELL DONE. I have given the establishment 3 stars but only because the staff provided the required service. This brought the quality of the food up from 2 STARS. I informed management at the time that if the rib eye was so advertised in Australia they would be sued for fraud. THERE WAS NO RIB, and the BURGER NOT EATABL

Rise is one of my favourite buffet restaurants. It offers a great buffet spread ranging from oysters, sashimi to Asian food as well as Indian food etc. There is also a variety of bread and desserts. There is plenty of room space for guests to move around to get their food without having to bump into one another. The buffet includes a make-your-own soda where guests can make their own soda drink which is quite fun. The service is good and the ambience is nice. I would have rated Rise 5 stars, if not for the strange policy that Sands Rewards Lifestyle members can only earn points if they are the ones paying the bill. It will be better and more attractive for SRL members to dine there if they are allowed to earn the points even if they are not paying for the meal, as long as they are present. I hope the management will tweak this policy for the benefit of the SRL members

An Easter weekend stay at the Marina Bay Sands was highlighted by a visit to this restaurant. Good location, good food....Singapore is generally expensive these days anyway, so forget the price side here. Service was as you'd expect to.....excellent.
5
Rise is by far the best buffet I have had! Service was great, food was tasty. Not too overwhelming in terms of flavor. Love the cheese selection as well as the dessert section! We really did enjoy ourselves. Would definitely recommend!

The breakfast was delicious. A lot of food to taste. International kitchen, Singaporean food. The cook was very nice.
5
WOW.. the staff and management went out of their way to make sure we had a table and great dinner!
The most beautiful food and the chefs were outstanding
The whole family was happy! Once again thank you so much 😋

One of the best buffets that we have had in terms of food and quality. There are pleasant surprises in the food variety offered. It is evident that careful thoughts are put into ensuring distinctive food variety and yet maintaining quality gastronomy experience. Beautiful chocolate fondue and great cheese and bread selections.Restaurant staff are warm and hospitable, special mentions to Benjamin and Kumar who ensure that our experience are pleasant and up to expectations. Benjamin is very hands-on and keen to ensure that all operations are running smoothly and customer experience is in check. We see an exceptional passion that Kumar has for his work. He was attentive and cheerful. His outstanding attitude has motivated me to leave comments.Great job

We paid about S$85 per person for dinner buffet (Mind you this is after 20% off a credit card discount). The buffet prices in Singapore is really getting horrendous! Well, yes there is oysters (but my friend got diarrhea after eating loads of them) there's alaskan crab leg (mostly frozen and not thawed well), a good salad bar, and a wide range of cheeses to select from. The rest of the food is rather mediocre. So why 4 stars? The people, they hung around, clear plates fast enough and generally always there when you nee help. We stayed and chat till almost midnight, although the staff were clearing, they never gave me a sense of chasing us off. Its the staff that makes a difference.How to make it 5 stars? Really have to look at the quality of the cold stuff, the sashimi grade is pretty bad (Salmon, Tuna and a white fish). Make sure food are thawed well before it goes on the buffet. Have better value stuff to justify its price.An additional point: Do not choose seats above the wooden panels, you will feel the earth shake each time someone walks pass, which is alot in a buffet situation

The breakfast buffet is 45 dollars. Quite a lot of options both asian, english, american, vegeterian etc. Heard about a chocolate fountain but didnt see it. The cheese platters and meat platters etc could have more viritiey and be decorated I ate mostly bread with eggs, bacon, tomatoes and mushroom which was good but somehow didnt surprise me in any way. I have had better breakfasts in many hotels in Europe to half the price or included in hotel that gave me more of an "wow" effect when we arrived. This was good and I cant complain on something spesific but is it really worth the money? Im not 100% sure. They didnt ask us for refill of coffee either and didnt ask if we wanted cappuccino etc (they just asked coffee or tea) which i found strange since i could see others asking spesific for it and got other kinds of coffees. To be fair we didnt ask about it but my expectations are high to this price
5
I came here with my family for a lunch buffet and it was a very nice experience. There were lots of food options, too much that if you would somehow like to try all of them, you'd end up with a very full stomach. The waiters are also very nice, they would always clean your plate as soon as you're done with it and refill your glass as soon as they notice that you've drank from it

This was our choice for our last dinner in Singapore. We had a small table away from the buffet. The best part of the meal was the amazing choice of food. A whole station for seafood, bread and dessert to name a few. The "make your own soda" station was interesting (using flavored syrups and mix ins). The main food selection was extensive with Western, Asian and Indian options. The atmosphere is good but not great. You are essentially in a 22 story lobby so not very "cozy" but still fun. The nice thing about the buffet is you can try some things you might not normally. We had fun and especially liked the dessert buffet with chocolate fountain and massive choice of options including flan, chocolate dippers and ice cream. Check out the fruit station with honey dripping on it from a real suspended honeycomb! Service was good but not amazing (7 out of 10). Cost was roughly $75/pp U.S. so get your money's worth. We didn't leave hungry

â€‹I had a buffet in this restaurant. It serves food from all around the world. The quality of the food offered was quite good. The only thing that may be improved is the service offered by the waiters, sometimes they lack in clarity and service
4
Been to Rise at least 20 times, and never disappointed.
Pricey yes, but huge with choice!
Be sure to get there before checking out!

Nice ambience ... good for business chit chat with relax even though location still around in lobby area, but not noise

I write to praise The Rise Restaurant - International Buffet on 11 Dec 2017 lunch. My staff and I had a wonderful time enjoying a sumptuous buffet spread and personalised service from a Rise staff - Mr Kumar.He had the best smile and service attitude. Throughout the 2.5hours we spent in the restaurant, he is attentive and organised in changing plates and cutlery once he saw the diners requires. It’s the personalised and impressive service I had that motivate me to write comments. The food is excellent and fresh. Great Quality for the price. Thank you The Rise staff and Mr Kumar.We will be back to the Rise soon again.Chris H

Came here to celebrate my mom bday. The food ws not too salty and even my mom who has a difficult to please taste love it. My sis love the salads and I enjoyed the DIY fruits soda. The warm, helpful and friendly staff, Arokia & Sanaya has make our visit even more memorable by surprise my mom with a cake , candle and birthday song after knowing that we are celebrating my mom birthday. Nice place to spend time with family and friends and celebrate any special day with special someone.

Went there for our department dinner, 16 of us. Friendly and warm service from Kumar! Food presentation looks inviting and yummy food! The banana walnut cake is very delicious as well as the yougurt ice cream.
5
We went the for breakfast. It was huge but still we had to wait for about 15 mins. But I must say very very well organised to handle the volume of people coming in. It is a very huge Hotel Marina Bay Sands. But service was excellent and prompt and polite. We had a very huge Variety to choose from. There was Indian spread, Chinese, Japanese, Italiano and what not. Fresh juices. Fresh fruits all fresh ge unique variety. Amazing Cappuccino. Very polite and curtious staff. Multiple live counters of eggs. Huge variety of breads. And on top of all excellent taste. Must go if at Marina Bay Sands.
4
I counted six different cooking styles and cuisines. Food is offered buffet style with some kinds of live cooking stations. Great variety from cold cut to hot dishes. Also variety of vegetarian food is available. Fruits, oysters, fish, noodles, meat etc. But, do we need all that? First, i thought the dinner would be pricy. But, having strawled through and ended up at the chocolate fountain I need to say good value for money. Seating is like the one in an upscale waiting area. OK. You will be there not for seating but for eating
5
We Highly recommend when visiting Marina Sand Hotel Tower, to check out the Rise Restaurant MBS, yes it is a buffet style restaurant, but WOW!! the fresh sea-food, Asian, Western and other ethnic dishes from around Asia, was bloody Awesome, so many choices, and presented beautifully, and the service and wait staff, were very helpful, polite, in short your treated like royalty, and not really that expensive, it was packed when we had dinner, but the service was fairly quick, and it looks like they can handle a large amount of guest with out much trouble. We will be going back, when next time in Singapor
5
We were a group of about 40 people here for the buffet dinner.The spread was simply awesome and so was the taste. Be it Sushi , Indian or Malaysian preparation, Prawns Crab or Chicken , the stuff was just too good.The dessert , coffee Icecream , caramel custard just amazing.Indulge!!
5
Great variety of super vresh food. Great theme nights. Seafood night was awesome. They handled a lot of people quite easily. Service amazing and friendly.

5
There's a lot of food to choose from, from American breakfast, Asian or Indian cuisines. I love their dessert bar too
5
We visited the tower to have a look around and stopped and asked if we could dine in without a booking and within seconds we were politely seated and made to feel very welcome! Alvin was our waiter and he went above and beyond for us - he was so helpful and happy and made the dinner even better! The food was beautiful and so so much to choose from and the desert section, oh my goodness, the chocolate fountain was the best! Oh and the make your own soda station was something I have not seen before and it was brilliant!! Would highly recommend this restaurant to all
4
The restaurant offer Buffet lunch and dinner at discount for the members the food is continental Asian and western cuisine and very nice with clean environment and good service Would recommend to the average person to visit the restaurant as it is good value for mone

The front desk service wasnâ€™t that good. I requested for a table near the food area because my mum has some issues with walking. But no matter how I asked the front desk, they refused to give me one. They allocated me a very far 2 pax table. I seriously think that the front desk people looks down on Chinese. Later on, they let Caucasians, both one or two pax, to occupy 4 seats tables. Really disappointing.However, the far table was a blessing in disguise. The waiter, Kumar, provided me excellent service. He was attentive and friendly. He was especially to all our needs. Fantastic guy!!!! I have eaten in this restaurant since Marina Bay Sands has opened. But never had I have such a deep and great impression of anyone working in Rise. He ought to be promoted and given a much better position in the restaurant. His back end service is definitely better than the front desk service. I will definitely return again because of him. Thanks a lot Kumar!!! It was a great experience for me at Rise all because of you!!! Thanks again!!!

We went for lunch on Wednesday, was busy but not once did we have to wait for food or service.Staff are super friendly and lovely, servicing your table regularly. Lunch was amazing with many choices, desert was stunning my absolute fav! Drink choices included in price was awesome. Concierge was kind enough to advise us if we signed up to their rewards card (for free) that we would receive a 30% discount. Would definitely go again, absolutely worth the money!
2
Dinner was such a disappointment, I love beef rare but not with a pulse! They could not get it right. I live in France and beef medium rare is not raw! which is what I was served here, it really was cold in the middle, totally uncooked, inedible. The fish was tasteless, the scallops in the shell were totally untrimmed and had obviously been frozen. The entire experience was not good. The positive note was that the food looked great, but I wanted to eat it not photograph it
4
Lots of variety, yummy food, cool setting. Soda bar is a highlight. Bit pricey (even when we got 20% discount as a Citibank customer). Would still recommend
5
enjoyed a sumptuous lunch wit my partner, very courteous staff, delicious food, very enjoyable day for our holiday
5
Visited the restaurant with my family to celebrate my dad's birthday. Love the ambience and wide varieties fresh seafood and others food choices.
Will definitely go back again !
5
I have to commend TJ for outstanding service he did last night. He is absolute and great guy he really took care of us.
i have to mention also Chigie and Romeo.
Keep up the good work guys.
5
The food here is amazing! Foods were always refilled by chefs Much selections! I bet you could not have a chance to taste all kind at once, definitely worth for revisit! Good services! Friendly staff! Good place for friends and families gathering, no more headache to choose for a better venue

We went back here on our last night in Singapore we loved it so much on a previous night. Staff are so professional and friendly our host Louisiana remembered us when we returned, the food was excellent we chose of the menu there was also a Buffett. We had Singapore slings red wine and scotch you are given nibbles with your drinks I had a beef ragout my husband had a stir fry very tasty. We finished with coffee the atmosphere was great being at Marina Bay Sands highly recommended not over priced definitely worth a visit if you are looking for good food service and price

Lunch buffet- nice breads & soups. Delicious desserts. Fruits were poorly displayed. Tiny flies on melon. But worse seeing blue cheese block sweating away, sitting on the liquid. It's wasted. Had to inform staff & they removed it. A pity. It was very humid in the restaurant so things which are fragile will definitely spoil faster. No attention to detail given to the poor cheeses

1. Before I arrived in Marina Bay Sands, I made a reservations with their newly revamped restaurant, RISE Restaurant.2. Marina Bay Sands' international buffet restaurant, RISE Restaurant re-opened in July this year, with an extensive transformation, featuring refreshed interior decor along with a brand of a new culinary offering that includes sustainably, sourced produce and themed nights3. Has eight open-concept kitchens and with 7 themed nights a week, every night is a sumptuous surprise that will bring diners on a journey through global cuisines, before paying homage to Singapore's heritage through timeless classics. "Live" cooking stations from pasta counters to meat carving areas will spice up the dining experience, while the bar offers a large selection of wines (including organic varieties, cocktails and juices. A new "live" grill station has been added to dinner service every night. 4. RISE Restaurant actually has an amazing RISE Herb Garden at the back of their restaurant where over 50 herbs, has inspired creations of cocktails and mocktails at the enhanced Bar. A brand new soda station, complimentary for guests, allows guests to create their own sodas using fresh herbs such as rosemary and thyme, pairing them with fresh fruits, juices and homemade syrups.5. RISE Restaurant starts serving from 6pm until 10pm. Good thing I made a reservation so, I was able to choose which table I would like for me and my friend. As early as 6pm, a lot of people already started to come in. During my visit, I was able to try their amazing signature dishesSignature Dish - Ayam Percik in Tangy Peanut Saunce(a Javanese dish consisting of candlenut, turmeric and fresh herbs from the herb garden -local sourced hormone- Free Sakura Chicken is marinated for 24 hours before being grilled to perfection in the backyard of RISE)Signature Dish- Baked Salt Crust Sustainable Barramundi(is a delicious and sustainably sourced fish baked in a crust of salt, dill, lemon, fennel, and coriander seeds. The dish uses locally sourced Kuhlbarra Barramundi that is also hormone free and antibiotic-free)Signature Dish - Home-Smoked BBQ Beef Brisket(featuring hormone free beef from Austaralia marinated with RISE's special rub and fresh herbs before being cooked over a smoker in the backyard) Signature Dish - Cream Cheese Frosted Banana Cake Chilli Crab, A lot of seafood, dessert and more!6. Their one-of-a-kind "make your own soda drinks" station where varieties of cold drinks you can made of - Pandan, Lemongrass, Raspberry to name a few...which comes to their buffet as well.We really had an amazing dinner at RISE Restaurant. For their extensive buffet food stations, and signature dishes, we really had a Fantastic dinner here. Especially their Chilli Crab, it was so good! Highly recommended! So worth it
5
I had my pre-dinner celebration together with my family at Rise Restaurant and it was a great and wonderful experience! It had a great ambience and there was a wide array of food choices that caters to everyone's taste buds. One particular unique experience was the make your own soda0 bar with interesting syrup flavours like lemongrass, cinnamon and even the pandan gula melaka which is uniquely Singaporean flavour! To add on, the staff service was also particularly awesome, by always checking up on us with whether the food is of good quality. I would like to specially name one of the waiter, TJ, where he was attentive, helpful and also friendly! He was definitely approachable. With such exceptional staff service, and delicious food, I urge and highly recommend you to come and try it yourself. I would definitely come back again, to try out the other dinner themes. A plus point, there are varying dinner themes each day, thus you should really come and try
5
Decided to check out the newly renovated Rise with my family and it was a great dinner! We went on a Thursday which had BBQ night specials on top of their amazing spread. Loved the soda machines where you can make your own flavours. Beef rendang was the best I've had and the oysters were yummy. Highly recommend
5
Rise Restaurant.Meat in this restaurant has won me, I will come here more than once, thank you for what you are.
5
The decor is nice, the service is superb, and the food, it is glorious food! A lot of variety and very enjoyable selection. One of the better buffets in town. Highly recommended!
4
Set in the main lobby nearest check-in, the airy feeling is impacted by the noises of the masses nearby. Service, even though mostly self-serve with the huge buffet, was friendly and efficient. There is a huge selection of hot and cold dishes of all varieties. The sushi is quite good though misses out on not having fresh wasabi available. Some interpretations miss, too, as a panzanella without any bread in it...Still, the overall food rating is very good
4
The restaurant looks more causal looking and welcoming now than before with very neat settings and clean cut presentations for most of the dishes.I was quite surprised by the authentic taste of the Hokkien Mee and Crispy Pork Roll Skin..crackling sounds with every bite.Great hospitality and service by restaurant manager Benjamin Tan and his team.I will rank RISE as one of my top buffet choices from today...from 'Weekend Buffet Warriors'
5
One of the best international buffet restaurant ive been. Make sure to make advance reservation during weekend or holidays as it might get crowded. It was located at Marina Bay Sands Hotel Lobby Tower 1. Appetising variety of cuisines. They wont disappoint you, from the staffs with exceptional service, to the mouth watering food and so on. The best! Yay.

We visited Rise Restaurant tonight for the American Buffet.Food was pretty good and varied but one hotch was they had run out of cold Tiger Beer which I thought was a trifle odd in Singapore. That besides a pretty good evening was had by al
4
Nice place, cool ambience, tables are spaced out nicely.The food is good but not fantastic (what do you expect from a buffet?) but it is high quality for a buffet with lots of choices: salad bar, sashimi and seafood, sushi, chinese, roast meats, western, indian, soup, bread, cheese, fruit and dessert that comes with a chocolate fountain.This is my second time and i found that there were more choices than the last although some of the seafood wasn't the most fresh. The sashimi - especially the tuna and kingfish were good. Skipped the salmon since this is available everywhere. The crab / lobster / mussels were so-so.The waiters are attentive but sometimes over the top... we had to decline coffee/tea orders around 4 times before they got the message. Plates were cleared promptly and otherwise everything else was great
5
We had dinner with my familiy, it was my daughter´s birthday. Everything was incredible: staff (extremely gentle), atmosphere (located at the lobby of the hotel) food and price. Let me explain a little bit about the food:you can taste Asian, Indian, Japanese or Western cuisine. Everything was delicious.Reasonable price but drinks a little bit expensive.Thanks for an unforgettable night

This is the first time I dine in RISE buffet. I went with my mom on 31 Aug 17. Overall, the dinner is great. Definitely, dine in RISE come with good ambience, varieties selection of food, together with great smile from the staff. Personally, I very satisfy with the western station, especially the meat selection. It is really taste good and fine cook.However, there are few areas I would like to highlight to RISE, so that there will be better dining experience for my next visit.1. Personally, I like seafood a lot. But the seafood serve on 31/08 dinner is not up to my expectation. The seafood bar - Seafood on ice - I tried scallop and mussel, the both scallop and mussel serve is not fresh and overcooked, it is difficult to chew. Same goes to the Alaska Crab, the serve is not rotten, but really not fresh. About the Sashimi bar, understand that the way RISE serve in big plate is for the convenience of guest to pick up the sashimi salmon, tuna and octopus. But when the crowd is not up to some number, the sashimi just left there exposed to the air for sometime and the quality definitely degraded by time. I hope there is better solution from your end if you hear this.2. I like the idea of soda water and how it served. Guest could mix and match the fruit and the cordial syrup provided. It really fun and taste good. However, if there is extra spoon provided with the drink will be better. To spoon the fruits in the drink.3. I hear a lot that the staff in RISE is kind and helpful. But I do not experience that on this visit. Such as, I have something to ask, I need to wait quite awhile before a staff could attend to me. I need new set of fork and spoon, I need to wait awhile before I could locate a staff to help me. I want to do the bill, I need to wait for quite awhile still no people could attend to me, then I walk to the counter request for the bill. The situation is not that there are many customer to attend and staff is busy. Just there are time I need help and there are no one around could assist immediate.Last but not least, maybe I hear too much good of RISE and I have high expectation on RISE. I would not said that it is a disappointment, it just did not meet my expectation. I will still recommend RISE to everyone out there to try

Went on Tuesday seafood night. Seafood was fresh, but the cooked meats section not up to expectation, they were a little overdone and too tough. Desserts were really good, and while i didn't have the Golden Seafood Soup, my dinner mates raved about it.And now for the horrible attitude we received from our "server" Sherwyn (not sure if this is how his name was spelt). At the beginning, we were served by different people, and never by this Sherwyn. After the first round of eating, we asked a waiter to help replace our placemats as they were dirtied, and provide new lemon water for hand washing. That waiter was Sherwyn. He removed our placemats grumpily without any smile, and handed us new ones and water with the same black face. We were then served by subsequent different waiters, and not once did Sherwyn come forward to serve us.Halfway thru the meal, Sherwyn came to me (because it was booked under my name) Suddenly all smiles, he asked how our dinner was, and introduced himself as our server for tonight. Uh, I've only seen him once (and WE approached him for assistance) with his grumpy face, so how had he been "our server" so far? Then he proceeded to promote this Sands Rewards Card to us. Fair enough, he said we would have 30% off, but we were not really interested. His attitude then significantly turned colder, then he asked us if we were MBS hotel guests. I replied no, and he went "Oh, you're not guests." Wow, was his face icy. After that, he NEVER came to serve our table again. No refilling of water, no collection of plates, no asking whether we need anything. So much for "your server for tonight" huh? The next time he approached us, was when we were getting the check. We were planning to use the 20% Citibank promotion, but it's only for up to 8 people (we had 14 people). He then said again, and this time with a snide tone, "That's why I said you should apply for a Sands Card with 30% discount, and no limit." I don't give reviews often, but I was too angered by his terrible attitude. I noticed throughout the dinner, he was all smiles towards foreigners, but to locals, the face was just cold and disinterested. And I noticed this difference in attitude from other servers as well, but probably not as disgustingly obvious as Sherwyn. MBS may be world-renowned and get a lot of income from foreigners, but don't locals pay good money as well? Is our money not good enough for MBS? I've had many international buffets at various hotels, and honestly this is the first time I've experienced such horrendous discrimination from the restaurant staff. Probably won't be back. Very disappointing

Was amazing and service was exceptional, a little pricey but was well worth it. Would go back again definantly

The food has greatly improved after the recent renovation. I think the food and service is excellent.

Lots and lots of choices with juices, fruits, ice cream to go along with a wide array of Japanese food, prime rib steak and grilled lamb, shrimps and many many more.

Had breakfast there since it was inclusive with the stay. Staff went out of the way to prepare jain menu for us.quality and taste could be improved. Overall a wonderful experience

It is a special dinner which invited 5 other youngers. We were being arranged a table which quite inside and below the bridge. The buffet dinner was crowded with hotel guests (I guessed).Most of the guests attacked on the sea foods on crabs, oyster, scallop and octopus. I tried on clam soup which met the standard I was expecting. Next was the oyster, scallop and sashimi. The quality was not bad except oyster. The nuts, fruits, and honey mix was the next which I liked It. For the drink, mango and cranberry are not bad.The table is being cleared promptly by the waiter/waitress. Overall the food and service is good

This is my third visit after renovation. Service staff are well trained - Attentive, patience and courteous.My friends and family members liked the fresh oyster, prawn, sushi and sashimi. A good spread of food to individual liking.I give my commendation to Mr Benjamin Tan for his friendliness, patience, a sense of humour and his leadership that lead to an excellence service team

Located in Marina Bay Sands. Easily accessible from Bayfront MRT Station.I have to talk about the ceiling. There is hardly any. The restaurant rests at the bottom of the hotel with the building soaring high on either sides. Real trees are interspersed in the dining area, pulling your eyes to the heights. "Unique" is putting it mildly.I understand that each night has slightly different cuisine. I expect that the base International and Local fare remains the same but with a few items on offer changing each night. I went on a Tuesday, that meant Seafood night. There was crab and lobster. I tried the lobster. It was a bit rubbery but otherwise tasty. The grilled prawns was good. I had roast ribeye which was really nice but maybe a bit underdone or not sealed or rested well, there was a lot of juice. There was Sashimi and other Japanese Sushi, but it was quite average. Indian and Chinese dishes were good. In particular the Marmite chicken. I did not try the pasta. The salad bar had a good range and was adequate. Dessert had a good range, not not overwhelming. But the Chocolate cake and ice creams were particularly good.Other items of note was the honeycomb with dried fruits and nuts, and the generous selection of cheeses.There were 2 juices on offer. Coffee and tea as well. Decaf coffee is an option but tasted weak to me.The clear negative was the price. Without a substantial discount, I cannot justify eating at the restaurant "just because". With a discount, well.. I have already made my next reservation

We went for the lunch buffet yesterday for the first time after the renovation. They add dim sum section, but the dessert bar become smaller and less varieties. The cakes selection onlyhave pandan cake , pandan sponge , & carrot cake. Where is the classic brownies and mouses cakes? The chilli crab is not fresh and the gravy is worst than hawker centre. We will not go back again.

Decided to visit this joint after reading reviews. Was not impressed after the visit. The food spread eas was large, but taste wise was a hit and miss affair. Some was too salty, too sweet or not flavored at all. And the chef basically butchered the meats (beef, lamb, even sashimi!). They should pay more attention on presentation. Pretty disappointing to expect this kind of standard from MBS

When it recently re-opened after months of renovation, RISE does not only offer great ambience, it has also come back with more fantastic choices in its already outstanding buffet. I came here with friends to celebrate my birthday and we were pleasantly surprised to find the place packed on a Tuesday night! We were told that it's been like that almost every weeknight since they reopened. Understandably so because the buffet spread looks awesome (from fresh seafood, sashimi, Asian delights, western favourites, cheeses, salad and of course, the amazing cake and pastry section!) and they taste great, too! Also, I would have to commend the staff for being wonderfully customer-oriented. They're all quick on their feet, friendly and always ready to assist. Definitely coming back again with my husband!:

Love this restaurant so much!
Great dining atmosphere, authentic cuisines, perfect service.
By the way, waitress Paula did a great job on promoting Rise restaurant!

One of the best places to have breakfast/brunch if you're in that area. There are many stations with wonderful food, everything was really tasty. We'll be back!

Was with my lovely wife dining in at Rise during Singapore National Day. Initially both my wife and i had a bad start with this restaurant, but Rise had a good customer recovery service which made both my wife and I having future plans and thoughts of coming back to Rise to dine in.The customer service is no doubt excellent and by far to me one of the best I've ever experienced. Of course I was being observant and seeing how everyone in RIse treat their customer, and no a single time a customer was left unattended when they need assistance.The food of course was amazing with a huge spread of different varieties of food and also I had fun making my own soda (which was something new for me). A lot of thoughts have been put into their food and soda and I will strongly recommend to anyone who is loving a new experience in buffet dining, to come to Rise and try it out.In short, if you are looking for something fun in your buffet dinner and also excellent customer service, Rise is the way to go. Till then, my wife and i will be back!Thanks again for the wonderful opportunity

We picked this place to celebrate our mum's birthday and I was very impress with the dinner buffet spread. There is large variety of fresh seafood, cooked food, salads, local/international cooked food and desserts. The dessert spread is perhaps one of the best in the league of the hotel buffets in this price range.Service was nice where they the staff prepared a small complimentary birthday cake (upon our advance request) for my mum and also sang a birthday song for her which we thought was really nice. Overall a great experience

Buffet LunchFirst visit after the renovations at Rise. The changed layout has advantages and disadvantages. The main disadvantages being that the table-clearing carts are constantly moving between the diners, and there are several more coffee stations (you don’t want to sit near to staff making dozens of coffees).The buffet spread has some changes, but remains ostensibly similar. Smaller sections: salad, cold cuts, Indian. Bigger section - shellfish. Added – two selections of juice. More Singaporean food has been added. In general, it seems most selections are a little smaller. The food remains fresh and reasonably good quality.Prices have gone up steeply. Even after discounts for using a certain bank credit card - $62 per person. MBS has pushed that a bit far and it remains to be seen if it’s beyond the demand curve.Rise is always well staffed – not a common practice in Singapore with labour supply being constrained by immigration tightening. Other hotels/restaurants could learn from this.A highlight of the meal was the service of “Carolyn”. Exceptional, product knowledge*, genuine service from the heart; attentive, charming and graceful. She should be managing a VIP outlet; not have her talents wasted with us rabble at the buffet. * How many managers at MBS know the number of rooms, the average guest count, the number of guests at the restaurant, and can still cite the “specials” at the buffet and make recommendations (that turned out to be good). I challenge all the hotel’s executive committee members to match Carolyn’s example!A good experience, made even better by one staff member.“…Good times never seemed so goodI'd be inclinedTo believe they never wouldOh, go go

Went there for my birthday celebration. Was great and the waiter and waiteress are nice. Especially a Mr Kumar make sure we are comfortable and he takes positive interest in our feedback or comment . All meant to be constructive. An excellent spread. Keep it up.

Rise serves a brilliant breakfast buffet with a wide variety of oriental, Indian and western dishes. The vegetarian options such as idli sambal and sweet dishes were really good - especially the fresh pancakes. However like everything at marina bay sands, the price is a little extortionate.

We were a party of 6 celebrating a birthday. The spread was fantastic with both western and Asian offerings. I especially enjoyed the seafood section. I have always thought I don't like oysters but at the urging of my friends, tried one and In the end had half a dozen before the night was over. Really fresh and shucked before your eyes. The scallops, however, weren't so fresh. The sashimi was really good too. I also thought the meats were very well done. The beef and pork belly were scrumptious. We also enjoyed the desserts very much.Service was attentive and they also brought out a slice of cake for my friend, and we could sing her a birthday song. It was all in all a very enjoyable meal

I had breakfast here the day I left. This is a buffet style. there are lots of options, but there are also lots of people. The servers seemed disinterested in the customers., For the money this is not a good valu
