We stopped in here for a quiet breakfast before heading out for the day. The location is a bit hard to find (it’s up some stairs), but just have the address handy. The coffee was good, the toast tasty, and the space quiet.

Fast free wifi 18 Mbps up / 16 down. Lots of outlets, great for working on your laptop. Try the glitter cold brew! If you stick around til 6pm, it turns into a bar.

Coffee shop by day and bar by night. Super super super dark inside, I had to leave to find another place to work as it was too dark. The staff was super friendly!

Had a very good lunch, ordered a camouflage coffee, piccolo, chicken salad, cheese sandwich and a unicorn tears- refreshing and cool! Will be back for their coffee !!

Came here with some friends after lunch nearby. Since they weren't drinking coffee I also decided not to and opted for one of the cold pressed juices. This was nice enough but I'm not sure it's really worth the price charged. The coffee here is a much better bet and I'll stick with that next time

A friend introduced me to this place and before we reached the place, he said that it's his secret hideout (guess it's not secret anymore now oops -- but who can say no to sharing the good stuff?),It's located at the 2nd level of one of the shophouses near to Amoy Food Centre. Once we stepped into the place, I instantly felt that I'm teleported to a different place - okay, not trying to sound too exaggerated but it really felt like going from a bustling CBD area to a chill, quaint spot. The deco of the place gives this old-school vibes and the place was dimly lit - which adds to the overall ambience of the place. The menus were cleverly designed too to fit the theme.As it was around 1pm, there was a lunch crowd and hence, it took some time for the orders to come through as there were only 2-3 people manning the place. I ordered the salted gula melaka latte cos I've never seen it before at anywhere else; My friend - a regular there - swears by the iced cold-dripped coffee there. Luckily, the wait was alright and the lady (lady boss probably? not very sure) was very nice to warn us to be careful of their takeaway cups - and I thought that was a pretty nice gesture.Will definitely be back next time to try the food/other drinks even though I'm tempted to order the salted gula melaka latte again

I came here with a bunch of friends during lunch hour for some coffee. I ordered the herbed potatoes, but was told I had to order the toast as the potatoes were an “add on order”. Fair enough. Waited 10 mins. My food came but no sign of my coffee. Waited another 10 mins and asked the waitress where my coffee was, as the table that came later than us had their coffee served. Taste:Herbed potatoes: 1/5. No seasoning at all. Asked the waitress but she said that “herbed butter” was applied. Clearly couldn’t taste it. Foccacia bread w jam: 3/5. Not bad. Tasted better than the potatoes. Mocha: 3/5. Normal mocha. Ambience: What I liked about this place was the ambience. Once you walk through the doors, it’s like you are transported to another place. Has potential. Service:Service was ok. However it could have been improved. Friend ordered a blend of certain juices but it was out. Ordered another juice, they didn’t have it. Settled for lemon tea in the end.Overall, a very average place. Has potential but the menu needs some work on..

Service wasn't the best, but not terrible either; & the delicious coffee & food make up for it.Salmon Avocado Rice Burger ($18 nett)Served slightly warm, this was delightful. The creamy avocado slices compliment the flakes of salmon. Rice buns are nicely done, too. I enjoyed this Dapper Granola ($8 nett)This surprised me with how flavourful it is. The slightly sour yogurt goes well with the little bit of honey. A good balance The granola was crunchy & delicious... & of course, lots of fresh blueberries & strawberries. Yum! Earl Grey Yuan Yang ($8 nett)A good solid cuppa. The lavender is fragrant but the real star is the solid strong coffee... Even the last sip didn't feel diluted. I hope I can sleep tonight  Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats Small dining area WiFi available⚡ Charging ports available  No service charge or GS

Dapper is the kind of place where my eyes and my palates get stimulated in a sense it's very different and unique. My latte came in a glass that looks like what my mum had at home when I was a kid. The place seems mysterious yet very comfy once you are there. I had the fruit salad and it was really yummy!Definitely a place to visit if you are around the area

Back here again for 2 more visits in the last few months. Consistently good quality coffee and staff remain friendly and efficient. Still haven't tried the food yet. Note that the address displayed here isn't correct: this place is actually located in Amoy Street and has been for more than a year
