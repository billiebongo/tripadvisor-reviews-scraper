Excellent Northern Indian cuisine with wide selection of dishes. Recommended the various naan options and chicken tikka.

Good food and friendly staff, all at reasonable prices. Great choice of dishes. The place is clean and the house pour wines are very tasty.

While a lot of places in Singapore suffer from the "get them in and get them out" with little, if any, hospitality, Barrels is the exact opposite. Without doubt the best service in Singapore coupled with great food and well priced drink I now very rarely venture beyond this little gem. Bus 200 will drop you off right at the door or it's a stones throw from more popular bus stops

Having been a patron of this establishment since it opened its doors 10 years ago, I can confirm that it has gone from strength to strength. Over the years the senior management has remained steadfast in their belief of providing good quality refreshments in a family friendly atmosphere. There is a varied selection of draft beer and strongbow cider available along with the usual spirit selections. The food menu has just recently been updated to include a few more choices. I can admit to having a weakness for the papadom and the Mutton Briyani is really really good. I have been eating this dish from many establishments in Singapore over the last 15 years and can safely say that Barrels dish is in my top 3!  This is a family managed business and the staff employed there make you feel part of the family. I wish them all the best for the next 10years

Excellent food, good variety but we always go for the Indian menu. Yellow Dahl, tandoori fish, any of the paniers, +++. Really good value and friendly staff. Cheap beer and sports channels always on, but quietly. One of the best Indian restates in the west side.

Indian restaurant, but also sells pizza....So far we have been there 2 times, main reason is that it's close to our home.Obviously we order Indian when we have eaten there.Tried several curry's which are all "OK", but super and not bad!Atmosphere is good.Music is a bit loud and playing rockmusic which is not nice for a Indian restaurant.Service is not that great

We have been going to Barrels now for the last 2 1/2 years. The quality of the food as always was fantastic. It doesn't seem to matter what day of the week we go the food is always excellent. Great friendly, family atmosphere. The staff are always happy, smiling and willing to assist. Nothing is too much trouble. Definitely worth a visit for great food, beer and Football
