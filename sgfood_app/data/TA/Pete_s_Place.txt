Among the flurry of Italian restaurants in Orchard, this one is quite distinctive for it's "normality". Nothing is special, but nothing is bad or mediocre either, it's good, consistent quality and taste and atmosphere in quite an unassuming way (normal).Though housed at Grand Hyatt, it's not overtly expensive, the service is swift and it's a good place to go for some casual dinning if you don't have anything specific or particular in mind

It's not my first visit nor review to Pete's place. I really love the food here. It's so fresh and authentic. Nothing fancy but simply a lovely taste like that of home. I totally vouch for this place , chef Aldo and his team.Yet this time round what got me disappointed most are the service. I do understand it's a busy weekend night. But obviously the service staff doesn't care enough. Glasses weren't refilled and we got to wave real hard to catch someone's willing attention. Whats more, when we ask deeper into dishes about the ingredients or recommendations, the staffs were unable to answer! How could the service staffs not have the knowledge of the dishes the kitchen server? It's totally embarrassing! The staff had to go to the kitchen And clarify with the chefs. I hope the service staffs can be educated on what goes into the dishes. That's more professional isn't it? I've also noticed that the service crew were mostly fresh faces. Understand f&b is a tough industry especially the work hours. But if a place with great food yet poor service, how would customers be keen on returning for the next dining experience

Though the selection bay Petes place is not huge, it’s very tasty. Pizza, pasta, meat and a gorgeous salad bar are all available on the buffet. The Sunday free flow is also a great deal!

Decided to pig out after a long week and went to try out Pete's Place after hearing it out from a friend.Ordered ham and artichoke pizza, sea bass, pork chop with fennel and tiramisu for 2 pax. The pizza was amazing, crust was light and chewy and the ingredients were well proportioned in a way no single item on the pizza was overwhelming and thus create a balanced harmony of flavours. We were even given 3 free servings of salad due to the early bird (6-7pm) promotion where customers get 1 serving for each order of a main course.Sea bass and pork chop were lightly seasoned and Chef Aldo mentioned this was to ensure the freshness of the food stands out instead of overpowering it with herbs and seasoning. This was actually quite true as even though we ordered quite a lot for 2 pax, we did feel the meal was not overwhelmingly filled to the brim. Perhaps simplicity is really best at times. For dessert, we tried the tiramisu. It's was nice but a tad more rum would be ideal and $16 bucks (sgd) is not exactly cheap for the portion.Overall, our experience at Pete's place was a pleasant one. If you are looking for fresh and simple food that let the ingredients shine for themselves, this is the place for you.

Pete’s place is a nice cosy place for a hearty meal. I want to praise Nino in particular, for being such a professional waiter with a warm and friendly attitude

This is my second visit to celebrate my mum and sis's birthday. We ordered the rustico pizza, market catch of the day, duck ragout pasta and seafood pasta. The seafood's very fresh and pasta freshly made. The duck ragout was very fragrant and thoroughly braised till the sauce tasted perfect! The duck meat's tender and we loved it. The market catch was pollack and it's skin was slightly crispy and salted with pan fried lemon at the side for you to drizzle on. The taste was just too good! Not to forget the pasta, everything about it is good. The taste, the pizza dough is tender and fragrant, the ingredients fresh and unforgettable. Once you start, you can't stop eating the pizza! We were also offered a salad for one each whereby you are free to select from the salad bar and free flow of bread and spreads. Their home made bread is also fresh, soft and yummy! Although the place is crowded in the evenings (everyone knows where to go for fine food!) their service is still impressive. They were attentive and humourous and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit at Pete's. They still impressed me for my 2nd visit.

great italian food..love the salad bar, very fresh. the dessert is also very good. do not forget to eat the tiramisu..
4
What a great family restaurant. Wide selection of free bread and spreads with a buffet style salad station. All our meals were enjoyed by our family of 8 and we returned twice during our recent stay in Singapore. Highly recommend for families if you want a break from the food courts
3
I have been to this restaurant many times over the last few years, but lately I am disappointed with the quality of food. Service is as usual excellent, but the food is disappointing! Had the lamb cutlets & spaghetti bolognese, both were very salty, drown it with 2 glasses of water to quench our thirst. Have tasted better Italian food elsewhere
4
It has been a few years since we were back. The food was generally good, but service was a little hit and miss. It was initially difficult to get the attention of waitstaff, but once the orders went in, service was good.As an early bird special, if you dine before 7 pm, you have free access to the salad bar with each order of a main. The breads were tasty and fresh. We ordered a calamari fruiti as a starter and it was okay, if slightly chewy rather than crispy. The lemon mayo aioli was great with it.The quarto stagnoli pizza was removed from the menu, so we had the Pizza Proscuitto. It was rustic, freshly made and delicious. We also had the Cioppino, which was on the expensive side, but this was disappointing. It was more like a marinara pasta with half a boston lobster, rather than the strong seafood broth that was full of flavour and was more like a soup. This was totally different from what was available here before
4
Some staff are helpful. One particular guy isn't. Otherwise good place to gather. Just wish they have more comfortable and supportive chairs. Nothing to hold lumbar
4
I've been a fan of Spaghetti Cioppino at Pete's Place. Though I wish it could be more 'soupy', this is adequately delectable. Early diners get complimentary salad & bread. If there's a wider selection of meat menus, it will attract more patrons.
5
Pasta courses were excellent. Veal saltimbocca was delicious. I loved the wide choice of bread and the buffet style salad station: so fresh, so many different choices. After dinner I went to congratulate myself with chef Aldo and sous chef Choo for an excellent job. Look forward to going back
4
Pete's Place one of my favourite cosy corner. The salad, soup and bread always good. My guest had the lamb chops and says it was awesome. Last but not least Pete's Place has got the best tiramisu in town
4
My family has been coming to Pete's Place ever since I was a little child. I haven't been in over 10 years and was excited that my family's Christmas lunch was going to be at Pete's Place. Not much has changed since the last time I ate there. The buffet had the same pizza, pasta and salad bars. The other dishes might have been different but since we are mostly vegetarian, we stuck with the pizza, pasta and salad. I remember loving the breadsticks as a child and was happy to see that they still had them, and the 3 types of butter that went with. We all had a great meal
4
Well, the lunch buffet is $38++, so it's overall ok bearing in mind the price. The fish today was haddock filets I think, but it was extremely salty. They later changed the dish to another a whole fish, which was better. The pork dish was quite nice. Overall, the hot food was not too exciting. Sadly they now only have ONE type of pizza. But the pizza was quite delicious today. But as it was the Christmas season, there were TWO log cakes. They were good. Yes, they were the highlight of the meal
5
Good, hearty Italian food in a rustic and friendly environment. Nostalgic and comfortable with brick walls and plaid table cloths. The food was lovely, we sampled many starters and finished with a beautiful panna cotta. The wine list was good and our waiter was attentive, polite and helpful. I would highly recommend Peteâ€™s Place for family, couples or business.
5
When it comes to good food Hyatt is the best. Pete's place is the best place to get your salad cravings fixed. Everything is fresh. The desserts are equally good too
3
I ordered Tagliolini Alle Vongole, I didn't particularly loved it, my friend ordered the Spaghetti Cabonara and that tasted really good. I had the bruschetta too, which was tasty. Felt that the price for certain food/drink was rather pricy. Also,the table that we had in a corner was rather shaky.The service was acceptable but not exceptional. It may be because we were seated in corner which is why it took a while for someone to notice when we raised our hand. But apart from that, staff were friendly.
5
The Spaghetti Cioppino (the one with the lobster) is really delicious, a little pricey for 46 but yummy. You can basically taste that the pasta seafood crab flavor was infused in the pastaThe pizza i ordered was good - MargheritaThe baked egg plant wasnt great, - definately wont order it again.staff service was ok, nothing that made me felt special.Ambience, was ok, overall 4 stars.Overall good for the pastas and pizzas
5
As always, Pete's place hits the spot, satisfying my Italian craving and treating my wife and I so well. We always come away happy and of course, the free salad bar before 7pm is great.
1
we came into the restaurant it seemed OK we then went up to the antipasti area. the bocconcini was SOFT and WATERY when we got our menu food it was covered in oil. to me it actually was mostly oil!!! do not come here again!!!!
4
Went to Pete's Place for dinner after a long day at a seminar.We had a reservation for 6:30pm, and were seated on time. The Salad buffet was elaborate, with a host of fresh vegetables, dressings, cheese and nuts. We ordered a couple of pizzas, a chicken, and a pasta dish. We had to wait almost an hour for the main course to arrive, which was the only downside to a wonderful evening
4
Though the food was not exceptional, the service from the restaurant was superb. I'm glad that the restaurant respected my wishes for a bit of privacy to celebrate my anniversary. In addition, I'm really happy with the surprise cake offered for my anniversary, which was perfect to finish my dinner. Thank you
4
Very good salad buffet, fresh ingredients, gourmet bread, cashew nuts and mushroom soup which were available in the past were withdrawn, will be good is they are put back on the menu. Good spread of dessert. Main course spread is very limited, though. Will be good if there is more variety. The tea and coffee is good. Service standard is commendable
4
Been going for years and as always food was good and service was good. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was cos we had a run in with the new head chef who refused to change a spaghetti to a penne and told off the chef who willingly prepared the dish for my child.
5
It’s a great place for gathering with friends, relaxed lunch buffet and they have a good price. I would recommend it.
5
Nice buffet & reasonable table wine. Excellent tiramisu. Good for healthy salad, good bread and soup
5
We come back again and again due to the amazing service and staff always taking great care of us. Food quality and salary buffet is absolute delicious and we love the fresh olive and tomato bread. Thanks Team, You Rock. J
1
we went to the Petes place restaurant in the grand Hyatt. the food was NOT very wonderful at all! the bocconcini was very soft and watery the pasta looked like it had 99.9% oil in it and the rest of the service and the night was NOT what we expected at all. I rate this restaurant 1 out of 5 stars
3
Staff is helpful n friendly. But overall seems like insufficient staff because we have waited quite long when calling for service
5
Affordable, good food, cozy atmosphere, not too loud or busy, great location. You can get free flow bread and butter (3 types and all good). I always come here for a casual dinner with friends and families.
4
the free-flow bar is the selling point here. not bad salad, better bread. the service is quite good. i would rate the food higher if not for a lame lamb chop
4
If you are only craving for salad, soup and fruits, you may try this buffet style. It’s not so expensive. But nothing can be highlighted. I would like to suggest ala cart menu as there’re wider selection. Overall, the taste is not bad for the buffet menu but a little bit less choice.
2
We always stopped by Pete's place each time we stopover in Singapore.We noticed this time the service standard has dropped. We had a booking confirmation and the maitre d couldn't find out booking. It wasn't as if the restaurant was fully booked. We have two young children, maitre d did not offer children's menu until we asked. We ordered desserts and my husband's was given to me and vice versa. I just do not expect that from Grand Hyatt. Now we know why the place is not busy. Not sure we want to come back any more for paying top dollars for poor service and okay food
5
We ordered the lobster seafood pasta and artichoke pizza. The taste and freshness of ingredients really amazed us. The salad and bread offered was also freshly prepared and tasted very good. The variety of food is wide and we were spoilt for choices! But the waiter did a great job of recommending great dishes to us! They were also very attentive to their surroundings and u cannot be missed at all. That's how wonderful there service is! Thumbs up to the great team of cooks and servers! The taste of their food is unforgettable and I am definitely coming again and again
5
great food...great salad...great italian food..very recommended to get the buffet lunch. Dont forget to have the dessert..
5
Go for the wide selection of salads and bread which taste as good as they look. There are always two different types in of soups to suit different diners. Don't forget the fruits and yummy cakes.
4
I loved the food. The salads were fresh and the burrata was yum. I loved the pastas, pizza and risotto. We had gone to celebrate a friends birthday and the staff made an effort and decorated the dessert according to the occasion. the food is sinful but the ambience is dull and the lighting is dim. If you're looking for a bright and cheerful place, there are better places but the food here is an absolute steal.
5
Lovely restaurant located at the basement of Hyatt. Excellent pasta at reasonable prices . Nice & friendly staf

I visited Pete’s Place a couple weeks ago with a friend. It was our first visit at Pete’s Place and we picked it out of location convenience. I had expected it to be a pricey meal, since it is housed under a 5-Star hotel. I was pleasantly surprised when the staffers told me their 3-course set dinner menu goes for $68 per pax, and we could choose any appetizer and mains from the menu. It sounded too good to be true that I had to ask the staffer twice to confirm my understanding of their set dinner promotion. The food was tastefully done. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about either. It was a contented meal that filled my soul. Service was moderate - the pace is good but I thought the staffers could be just a wee bit friendlier.I spent almost 3 hours dining there because the ambience was good enough to chill and chat over drinks post-dinner. By the end of the evening, both my friend and I agreed that we should come back here again
5
The staff have been very friendly and attentive. Their excellent service impressed my guest! Servings at Pete's place are also very generous. We have enjoyed our dining experience there. Keep it up
5
We decided to try Pete's Place after reading about the new pizza chef that was hired. Decided to have the lunch buffet and it was truly excellent. Started with a very fresh outstanding salad bar, wonderful minestrone soup, excellent fresh breads and pizza bar with Margarita & also mushroom pizza which was some of the best we have had. They made you a "made to order" pasta dish, lamb stew, roasted pork, Italian chicken & a fish dish.We usually don't eat desserts but the tirimisu and flan type pudding with caramel were very good.Service was great & we talked with the pizza chef & wished him luck as he goes onto the world pizza competition in Las Vegas
4
I visit Pete's Place whenever I come to Singapore which is about twice or thrice a year. The charm of the place is in its seeming casualness with a brick oven atmosphere and pink plaid tablecloths. The food choices are good for vegetarians but the wines are not. I appreciate the service of the staff there especially Zack who always goes out of the way to ensure vegetarian food is served and in a tasty manner and to ensure overall guest comfort
4
nice place...great food...good dessert...always enjoy the lunch at this restaurant...will keep on coming back.
5
My friends and i normally share our mini reunion once a month to celebrate our 20++ years of friendship over sumptuous dinner. This year we have tried Pete's place at Grand Hyatt hoping and wishing to satisfy our craving for authentic Italian cuisine.We are overwhelmed with the food and service of Pete's place specially the friendly gesture and good food prepared for us by their chef Daniele Colaiacomo. It was indeed a night worth remembering
4
That was one of the night having heavy rain so I decided to have my dinner inside the Grand Hyatt Hotel.Pete's Place the restaurant is located at LG floor.I have ordered the Chef's recommendations >> Spaghetti Cioppino (Spaghetti, lobster, scallops, clams, tiger prawns, fresh herbs, tomato sauce)
5
Pete’s Place recently recruited a pizzaiola (professional pizza maker) as part of its efforts to raise its authenticity as an Italian restaurant. The pizzas served here are chewy yet light. If you love a good pizza, order it because the pizza dough is tasty due to the 24 hour maturation period. Even the crust can be eaten on its own because it has a flavour of its own after being blistered in the wood fired oven. There’s a good variety of pizzas on the menu but because the dough is a star on its own, even the Margherita (mozzarella and basil on tomato base) will yield satisfaction. Do talk to Daniel the pizzaiolo because he is passionate about pizza and the knowledge he shares (if you talk to him) will enhance your future pizza eating experience. You’ll learn to differentiate between good and mediocre pizzas. As a service experience, Daniel did more than any of the other chefs at Pete’s Place ever did. He was warm, hospitable and patient - enhancing the dining experience because I could now relate to the food and the person making it. If I ever have pizza craving, Pete’s Place is my go-to place.
5
I have been eating at this place for many years, eating usually pasta. When my wife and myself sat down, we noticed that the couple next to us was having pizza. By being Italian I could rareway spot that pizza was looking really good so this time I decided to try.Done with our starters, two pizzas were served, and I was already happy just at the look of it. It seemed to be in an authentic Pizzeria down in Napoli. Very good ingredients, and the dough was crispy on the outside and soft on the base. I came to know Chef Daniele, he did a really great job. I don't usually ask for details, Chefs are very jelous sometime, but I could tell that dough was not just prepared overnight. I would say there is at least a 24-36 hours job, which takes a lot of effort.Definitely the best pizza in Singapore. Keep up the great work and thanks for the wonderful dinner.Cia

Came here back after a Friend told me he enjoyed.Had Angus beef (too sweet) lamb chops and. Cioppino. Cioppino was v good and way better than the meats. Meats weren't fantastic. Cooked well but lacked wow. Prosciutto melon - melon wasn't sweet. This wasn't the petes place I remembered. Felt disappointed
5
Pizza maker is an italian friendly guy using the most authentic ingredients to make an incredible pizza feels like being back in Italy. In addition can be informative to know the Gluten Free Pizza is an option for those intolerant. We had one pizza and the calzone too. Lastly price is reasonable for S'pore standard
5
Great ambient for a quiet and authentic Italian restaurant. The lobster pasta was the best of the meal and deeply appreciated by the gesture of the restaurant to provide the wonderful tart with the candle for my wife's birthday
3
Shared a meal with some friends at Pete's and frankly I expected more. Tomato sauces that tasted more of tomatoe paste than home made sauce, pasta inconsistently cooked with some under cooked, some mushy and one aldente.A bit light on in terms of the seafood quantity and I was particularly disappointed with my Cioppino. It seems Maine lobsters come in clawless halves, blue swimmer crabs don't have much meat in them at this time of the year and the three prawns were without doubt the smallest and most emancipated black tiger prawns I have ever had presented. I did not finish my meal but no questions were asked.I didn't find much to encourage a return visi
4
Quality of ingredients were good. Taste was also good. But totally it is not the place you can find pizzas same to the ones you had in Milano, Roma or Florence..
5
Amongst the thousands pizza restaurants I have tried around the world Daniele Colaiacono 's pizzas at Pete's Place in the Singapore Grand Hyatt, have to be the ones that top them all. Mouth watering, perfectly prepared base thanks to his own formula, it makes the final product, whether a simple focaccia or a more elaborated 4 stagioni, undoubtedly the best I have ever tasted. Even in Italy sometimes it is difficult to find a satisfactory pizzeria. I can assure you won't be disappointed.
4
We had a lovely night out.The pizza and tiramisu are tasty.One of the must visit Italian resturant
4
I've visited here a couple of times at lunch and this place never disappointed me. Only they need pasta dish improvement. Otherwise I am happy with this place.
5
In Grand Hyatt hotel. Authentic Italian food. Buffet spread include pizza, soup, salad bar. Salmon, chicken, meatball, desserts, breads, spaghetti etc. Not an extensive spread but good enough for lunch. Pizza is freshly baked and it's really good. Excellent service by the staff
4
Pete's Place is one of Singapore’s favourite Italian restaurants that serve authentic Italian buffet which was value for money. The buffet spread was reasonably wide, featuring freshly baked pizza, cook to order pasta, home made fried chicken wings, steamed sea bass, braised beef cubes, and the popular salad bar. Not forgetting the desserts favourites such as the Tiramisu and chocolate tarts
4
Firstly, the renovation and decor of the place is fuss free and nothing fanciful. Service; very good. The buffet spread wasn't extensive, but that was to be expected as it was not an international buffet.Cooked foods had varying results, some being more liked than others by our table. The pizzas on the other hand, were really good. Having travelled quite a bit, and eaten pizzas at highly reviewed pizzerias and ristorantes in NYC, and Italy (even Naples itself!), I must say that the pizzas here are one of the best I've ever eaten! Highly recommended for the pizzas!So for me, pizzas and service earn high marks here
4
I was at Pete's Place for lunch with my family on a recent weekend. I was looking forward to a good spread of delicious Italian food. However, I was a bit disappointed with the variety of spread available. The overall quality of the taste for most of the dishes was average. But I must honestly say that the pizza was truly amazing! I saw with my own eyes that almost immediately after it comes out of the oven, the queue starts and the pizza disappears within a few minutes.If you want to get a taste of good Italian pizza, this is the place to go! Unfortunately, I heard this place is closing down, so I'm not sure how long more will you manage to eat the pizza there..
4
Excellent service; very polite staff and attentive however they seem to be quite shorthanded during peak hours on a Saturday buffet. Salad bar ingredients were very fresh however would be nice to have more Italian antipasti. Pasta siciliana & aglio olio peperoncino were both disappointing as they were not al dente and lacking in flavour. Main courses did not seem to be authentic Italian either though I was commend that the Salmon was cooked to perfection.Pizza was the saving grace as the dough was light and crust was perfect. Tiramisu and creme brulee was good!Love the ambience of the restaurant as it made me feel like I was back in Italy. Will surely return
4
My friend who was visiting from the US really loves Italian food so we decided on Pete's Place as it was pretty central and easy for all (four) of us to get to. Everything went down very well - from the superb bruschetta to the pasta dishes to the tiramisu. They also have very decent wine at very decent prices. Thank you Chef Aldo and team
5
The food and service is amazing!!! The bread served was delicious!!! Pete's Place is hghly recommended!
5
Was there with the family to celebrate birthdays... Staff was attentive and friendly and cleared plates quickly. Spread had good enough variety and Pizza was excellent, fresh from the oven. Loved the desserts too with special highlight to the Tiramisu.
5
Absolutely The best Pizza in Singapore. We came there with some friends and we had a really good time. The Chef Pizza was very sympatic and the Pizza was sooooo good !! I totally recommend
5
Perfect night to end the work week with a dinner at Pete's Place, one of our favourite restaurants. Love the freshness and variety of the salad bar. The mains never fail to impress and are done well here with its authentic flavours. We paired it well with the house wine,which is smooth to drink and does not lack in quality.The service from the team was impeccable that night as always.Paul, Zack and Chai were especially attentive, despite the bustling crowd. It's indeed their warm hospitality and personal touch that brings us back week after week
5
Great food at Pete's Place, as always...really enjoy the food, the service and the ambience of this restaurant...will always coming back to this restaurant, for sure
4
Everything safe as usual. Had Pollock fish. Nice meaty fillets but not much flavor. A tasty pumpkin soup. Also had a nice flourless chocolate tart today. More of an eggy flavor, but I liked it. Only one pizza. A limpy mushroom pizza. Oh. I think they increased the price by $3 for the lunch buffet. Oh well, I guess everywhere has taken the opportunity to increase prices because of the water hike. So that's life.
5
It had to be more than 10 years since hubby and I had been to Pete's. The moment we walked in, it felt just like yesterday because nothing had changed - and that's the beautiful thing about it. The food was just as good, the service was just as good, the ambience was just as we remembered it and prices were still very reasonable! We vowed to not forget "old" Pete's Place again
5
I have been to Pete's place many times. I would like to commend the great service there. Wonderful bunch of staff, ably led by the fantastic Vina and the always friendly Zacch. Nice staff include Paul, Nino, Chai, Donna, Yunos, Elsa and Jamie. Keep up the good work! Well done
5
Another favorite, we had a lovely dinner and wine. The bread bar is amazing, as is the Cioppino. Pizza was great
4
I have been dining frequently at Pete's place. Due to my dietary restrictions, I usually order the same dishes time and time again.The pizzas have always been good and consistent. Yet on the night of 31 July 2017, the margherita pizza was surprisingly different. There was a fresher aroma, the tomato sauce sweeter, the cheese more heart-warming and the texture more refined. Splendid!The pastas are made to order, and the chefs and staff have always been accommodating to my requests.The free salad bowl for early diners certainly helps balance the (my) diet.The prosecco and organic house red wine (Sangiovese) are very reasonably priced.The next statement is certainly long overdue. Thank you Vina, Zack, Paul, Nino for always looking after me and my guests. You have all been most professional, efficient, knowledgeable and ever so warm. With that, I will be visiting you guys again next week
2
The quality and taste of the food is not what you would expect from an italian restaurant in this price range. The pizza diavola (chefs 'specialty') was lacking taste and good ingredients and when served, almost cold.The service is ok, but Singapore has much better to offer, so wouldn't recommend it
4
I love the pizzas here. Service is also great. We didn't have a booking any they were very accomodating
4
I was quite unsure of what to expect but I must recognise that the pizza was very good. Not particularly cheap but reasonable in its neighbourhood. I cannot give my opinion about other dished as I was there for a quick break, but with the pizza you cannot get wrong
5
We went there for a work dinner (italian company). Very nice food and environment. Original italian pizza. Will go back there for sur
5
Was already a great restaurant..but now with the addition of an Italian pizzamaker is amazing!!!Best pizza i have ever had in Singapore in 5 years!Way to go pete's place!
5
Nino Rull is a service staff in Pete's Place. He is very attentive and meticulous towards all the customers. He always wears a smile on his face and is polite in welcoming customers. Overall, 10 out of 10 for him!! :
5
We've been here few times, and we just love this place and the food. The breads for the compliment are best too. We order different foods when we come, so we know more of the menu. We just wish, you have more choices there, and it will be more good. The staff are really friendly, and noticed us as we've come few times. Love the dessert too will definitely come there if we travel to singapore again
5
Been around forever and still going very strong - staff are great and the food is very good - think comfort food in the middle of Singapore
4
Eaten here a couple times and the food and service are consistency very good. Everything I've had has been prepared in traditional Italian styles
5
We went along on a Tuesday night to this restaurant on our recent family holiday. My husband had visited this restaurant 40 years earlier with his parents and grandparents and remembered it fondly. So, off we went on a trip down memory lane and gave this one a go. When we arrived, my husband felt the décor was just as he had remembered it. The welcome from the staff was equally friendly and felt like coming home. We had decided to take advantage of a special offer they had where, if you arrived to dine between 6 and 7pm (from memory, this was only certain nights but I'm not sure), you could order a main meal and get a salad and bread bar inclusion. We were quickly seated at a clean, good sized table with comfortable seats and drinks brought to us.We went up to the Salad Bar first to select a generous sized plate of salad and the quality was exceptionally good. Instead of tired, old salad coated in mayonnaise, the ingredients were fresh, varied and all dressings were separate enabling you to chose as much or little as you wished. Next we moved onto the bread bar and we were spoilt for choice with the selection of breads. This was a meal in itself!When our meals arrived, we were happy with the quality of all 4 meals. What was pleasing was that they also allowed one of our girls to swap the style of pasta on the menu to a fettuccini which she prefers. This was no trouble to them at all.The whole time we were eating, water was refilled, drinks were offered and the staff were attentive without being intrusive. By utilising the salad bar offer, prices were very reasonable especially considering the service standards being so high and the quality of food being so good.The next night was our last night in Singapore and, we had been so happy with Pete's Place, we went back again. This proved the first night was not just a co-incidence. The food was again terrific and the service exceptional. The team seemed happy to see us back and we enjoyed a laugh and a chat with them.Another nice touch was that both our kids didn't eat all their mains given sizes were generous. The team happily put the food in containers for their lunch the next day and also included some lovely freshly shaved parmesan cheese. We thought this went above and beyond the norm and our kids were rapt to get a great lunch the day after.We would definitely recommend this restaurant as good value if you eat early certainly by Singapore standards as we did find many of the restaurants more expensive then we were used to. There is a reason this place has survived for so long....it's great family food. :
1
This restaurant is the WORST restaurant i have been to in my life .some mummy recommended this Italian restaurant in Singapore,so we went there .... after a long 15 mins the waiter ordered my food ........... then my food arrived and it was soaking in oil. My pasta tasted like water then we left in complete disgust hoping not to feel the aftertaste of that oil in my mouth. Also salad bar they had nothing that said antipasti at all! please do not go!!!!
4
A wide selection of salad with condiments.Warm soup to go alongA choice of either salad buffet or full buffet
4
Returned to Pete's Place after not being here for quite a number of years. Was not disappointed. The quality is still there
5
Located at Grand Hyatt Singapore, Pete's Place is the perfect place for dates, family & friends gathering. I love the warm and cosy atmosphere, the kind of tablecloths and brick walls bring about the European feel. The service in Petes Place was impeccable & deserved to be complimented. Keep up the good work!
5
Amazing service - very friendly and helpful suggestions on what to eat. Food was both traditional and delicious - also a wide variety of wines. Vegetarian and vegan options too!
4
Had dinner at Pete’s Place recently. We got there around 6pm so we managed to enjoy the salad that came with our main course. The salad bar had a decent selection of veggies, four different salad sauces + a load of other ingredients, condiments and cheese. There was also a variety of free flow breads with 3 different types of butter.For main course, we had the steak, lamb chops, lobster spaghetti and clam pasta. They even served a children’s meal (cream pasta with sautéed potatoes) for my younger boy. The quality of the food was very good. The steak and lamb chops were cooked medium well just nicely. The pastas were also just al dante. The portions were more than sufficient for normal eaters. They also served the kid’s meal ice cream in cute mason jars. Nice touch.The restaurant was very relaxed, cosy and had an Italian atmosphere. The staff were jovial, attentive and prompt. We even got a free parking coupon (if you spend more than $100). Overall we were very pleased with our meal at Pete’s Place. Thumbs up

I'm not someone who takes the effort to write reviews on restaurants I've visited. I appreciate good food and of course great service at affordable range. I've been to many places but usually they fare great on just either one. But.. now I've found and fall in love with Pete's Place. I just have to let them know how impressed I am! My husband and I wanted to try out a new restaurant in celebration for our wedding anniversary. Through a friend's recommendation, we heard about Pete's Place. We've been to southern Italy on our honeymoon and we really miss the food, culture, language and people. We are so excited and Pete's place brought us those fond memories. The food here is excellent and so authentic. We asked to meet the chef and had the pleasure to speak with Chef Aldo who's so kind, patient and friendly. His explained to us on the dishes and the ingredients used. Gave us recommendations and checking back on us to ensure we enjoyed the dishes, making effort to seek feedbacks on the food. He is very attentive ensuring the service staff takes care of the customers. I really enjoy the dinner, hospitality and service received. Well done Chef Aldo and all the crew. You guys left us a great dinning experience. We will be back. Ciao

Always satisfy with the great food at Pete's Place. The staff are really friendly too. Will keep on coming back to this restaurant.

Had lunch at Pete's place on Saturday and it just felt like something was missing at Pete's place. It used to have a certain energy or buzz in the restaurant, in the chefs and wait staff. But all that was missing. It had a very limited choice of mains and desserts, i.e. 3 mains - fish, chicken and pork dishes for a buffet- so that was disappointing. Range of Desserts were equally disappointing - tiramisu, caramel custard and 2 cakes.I thought Tea and coffee should be free flow in a buffet but was told by an extremely cold and aloof waitress that it was "only one time". Excuse me "one time"?Poor experience overall. Service and food needs to improve as well
5
Be sure to be here at 6pm as there is a salad n bread buffet from 6 - 7 pm w a main course order. It is situated at basement of Hyatt hotel. The interior is very Italian style. A very cosy restaurant. Staffs are very attentive as well who will refill water when the glass is half full.
4
The greatest attraction for me is the salad bar. The variety is wide enough and the salad ingredients are fresh and of good quality. The tagliatelle with crabmeat is really good
5
I have been a Club Hyatt Member for the past 17 years. The reason for being a long member is that the cuisines are prepared meticulously. The taste of the food reflects the careful thought that has been given in the preparation of every dish. Every visit is most satisfying and memorable especially at Pete's place. The team of Aldo comprising his goodself, Choo Siew Leong, Benz, Peter Hoh, Victor Sig and others are simply remarkable. Their service is par excellence. May I say that " it is Italy at Singapore Pete's place". Right from pasta until the bread and the cheese are simply Italian. My business associates and friends love patronising Pete's Place. Most importantly it is really value for money. My heartfelt thanks to Aldo and his team for making every visit to Pete's Place not only a satisfying but also memorable. Keep up this sterling performance, Pete's place. Looking forward to my next visit. Nageb and Khadija

Since our last visit a few months ago we returned last weekend for the buffet lunch. Whilst the food quality has been maintained the selection of dishes has been reduced. This applies to the starters and in particular the selection of ham and salami which has been reduced to one! The sweet offering has also suffered.One new feature has been the introduction of the chefs serving some of the dishes at the tables. This included freshly made pizza and a crab offering both of which were very tasty.The service level is good and the staff remain very friendly. The buffet, however, is not cheap
5
What an enjoyable experience, as always! It's not our first time at Pete's because every return is a pleasure. The Burrata and Pomadoro was a perfect harmony of flavours. Another fave at the table was the Cacciucco Livornese seafood stew - we mopped up every bit of the gravy with the crusty bread. Go for the tiramisu for dessert! The mascarpone soaked lady fingers were a great end to the dinner. Will definitely visit again whenever we crave for authentic Italian food
5
The selection is not a lot but the quality is excellent. Love the bread and salad selection. Caters for people who appreciate quality and love of rustic bread
5
Although I lived in Singapore for two years, I was never aware of Pete's Place. Its location in the basement probably doesn't help. However, upon looking for an Italian restaurant near Orchard, I "discovered" Pete's and was glad I did! The food was excellent - hearty traditional Italian food and decent prices (especially the wine). The bread bar was a nice touch. Service was ok, but then again most restaurants in Singapore have some issues due to limited manpower. Would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore
2
I've been to Pete's Place any times and it's been around for decades. But my latest meal there was a poor experience. First, we were given a very dark table and had to request for a change. We had to wait a bit, but were given a brighter table. At the end of the meal I realized that there were several tables that had never been occupied at all. But it's a small matter. My main problem is the food.We had the buffet lunch. The 3 hot dishes could be better. One of the items was very fatty belly pork. Also they used to serve 2 different pizzas. On the day I went, it was down to one, and it was a plain tomato pizza with a dollop of very wet burrata on top. Few diners liked it, as soon the pizza slices were left untouched. Oh yes, the mushroom soup had little flavour of mushrooms. It was much better before. Minestrone was the same. Coffee took a long time to arrive. And I noticed it was left on the counter and had to go ask for it to be brought to our table. Service has also become noticeably poorer. Even when I wanted to pay the bill; at least FOUR staff members were visible to me, but my raised hand and credit card waving was apparently invisible to them! So strange
5
.. restaurant in town when you are with family, friends or more people together out for enjoying Italian food... Excellent quality and a good service inside a cool place .
5
Definitely a place to return for. It's my second visit here and it is as good as it was. Nothing fancy but every dish taste so authentic like home. Thumbs up to chef Aldo and team. Just a side note, we felt that the restaurant is understaffed for its service crew. Service should definitely be improved. Great food and service have to go hand in hand. May the management takes the necessary actions to deliver that 5star service standard
5
Chef Aldo takes pride in his work and treats every customer with a smile. The food he cooks is delicious and he acts on feedback to make his every dish a better one. He makes sure his customers leave the restaurant feeling satisfied. His positive attitude is indeed commendable
4
WE reached here late night, after a whole day of walking. It was the perfect place to eat a good hearty meal. We ordered a pasta with nice warm bread. Decent place
5
Great Italian food Sunday brunch with free flow prosecco, wines, pizza pasta and Italian dishes . Awesome
5
Love the buffet spread during lunch and lovely cosy area. Will definitely go back for the buffet lunch.
5
Pete's Place is our "go to" Italian restaurant for a casual meal. Ambience is homey.Service is great and friendly (they remember you and chat appropriately) and food (at least what I always order) is excellent. Love the very tasty squid ink pasta (a little bit over al dente which I like) with (fresh/crunchy) prawns!They also offer a complimentary, nice selection of bread (help yourself) which is helpful if you are very hungry
4
always enjoying the food at Pete's Place...one of the best place to have brunch on Sunday. Dont forget to try the tiramis..the best in town
5
Had a great evening at Pete's Place with my wife and son. We hadn't been back to Pete's Place in more than 2 years and were pleasantly surprised to find the food quality much improved from our last visit. Prices have remained reasonable for an Italian restaurant located in a hotel (like the Grand Hyatt). The Sirloin was substantial and well priced (S$39). The quality of the steak was good. I had the Lamb Rack (S$36). Very decent for the price. The serving was generous too. The house red (Vino Rosso) was a respectable Sangiovese (S$12 for 250ml, $24 for 500 ml and if you need more than a bottle's worth $48 for 1 liter). That's a reasonable price to pay in a restaurant these days. The service was a stand out. And that made the evening complete. Special thanks to Vina the supervisor (always served us with a smile), Paul (thanks for checking on my family making sure we were alright and recommending the house red) and Winnie (a trainee who displayed a lot of enthusiasm and initiative).
5
We love coming back to Pete's Place for its ambience, good food and impeccable service by Vina and team. Great early bird complimentary salad deals for every main course ordered. The unpretentiousness of this place is a gem.
4
Brunch in Singapore is usually a flashy over the top event with so many food options you can't hope to do it justice unless you are related to Jabba the Hutt. Pete's place is much more restrained and cosier for it. Service is friendly and relaxed and the range of food much easier to navigate. Some dishes are brought around and offered at the table. It is also much less expensive than the big hotels and while it me seem less sophisticated is actually a refreshing change from the hedonism of other brunche
5
We love to go back to Pete's. Food is excellent, despite that Menu is not changing a lot. We truly love the Salat Buffet, very fresh, and great olive/tomato bread Great service!
4
Still friendly, good atmosphere, very good service and the food was as consistent as ever. It was a good idea to go back after so many years
5
The staff was very polite and helpful as usual. Wide spread of salad n bread choices. Buffet ends with nice tea or coffee. Value for money
3
Went for a Sunday buffet, was rather disappointed, things were just ok, nothing really special. I know Singapore is really expensive and this buffet is an average price, but everything about including the service, was average.I wouldn't recommend this offering to others but suggest you look for something slightly more expensive which in the end maybe better value
4
Went there for a quick bite and service was quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Seafood pasta was ok, a bit soggy and bland for my taste but pasta was cooked well and seafood was fresh. Mr. Vino ( I assume the Manager) was very attentive and friendly - a true asset to your company
4
Have not been to Pete's Place for sometime. Decided to dine there with family members to celebrate my wife's birthday. The staff & especially the sous chef were extremely hospitable. Pete's Place lived up to its reputation for good Italian comfort food. The truffle risotto & quarttro formaggi pizza were particularly nice
5
I love Pete's Place. This is one of those restaurants that have been here for a long time. Their meals are hearty and simple but done extremely well! You are always guaranteed a great meal, no matter how long you have been away... love their bread counter, am a huge fan of their olive and sun dried tomato focaccia bread!!Service is also consistently great and their staff have longevity too, I do see several familiar faces every time I go...Look out for their specials which are written on a little blackboard just after the entrance.
5
Petes Place offers some of the greatest pizza and Italian food in Singapore and the service is absolutely amazin
5
Traditional Italian food, with seasonal menus with seasonal produce, great classics and great servic
4
Didn't realise that my credit card promotional discount wasn't valid on a public holiday eve but decided to eat at Pete's anyway. Pasta took a long time in coming. Management made amends by offering complimentary dessert which I declined as I was in a rush. Subsequently, I was extended a complimentary pasta from my bill which I didn't expect.It was a nice touch and much appreciated. Thanks to Vina and his team
5
The salad buffet is quite nice and offers a good selection. The pizza we had were both quite nice, especially the pizza burrata
5
We have been visiting Pete's Place for about 30 years and is one of our favorite Italian Restaurants in Singapore! Food is excellent and the service is superb!! Especially from the ones who have been there from day one!!! Highly recommended!Enjoy!!!Cheers Bab
4
The salad buffet is wonderful - the selection is good and the items are super fresh. there is also a good selection of breads. The pizzas and squid ink pasta are lovely
5
Always enjoy the Sunday brunch at Pete's Place. Salad bar is really good. Dessert is superb...especially the tiramisu...the best in town
4
My family and I have been coming here for over 10 years. Pete's place is located in the basement and has a rustic feel to the place. The Pete's place team always are hospitable and warm. These days when I go there, I look forward to meeting Aloysius, Paul and Zach who still understand real service and always deliver exceptional dining experience.Food wise is quite an adventure as their head chef turnaround is quite high. But the good thing is that each chef brings in a new repertoire or regional style of Italian cooking which provides a refreshing take on the regular items on the menu. For me, I had my first real carbonara here (no cream, just cheese and egg, for the sauce) and had one of the best meatball pastas (no longer on the menu) here. Pastas are made fresh in-house and brings a nice textural dimension that complements the home made sauces. The current favourite is the chiopino because of the tomato seafood sauce. Try it!Pizzas are nice but the dough and cheese could be improved. For example, they could use real mozzarella instead of the yellow processed version for a more sophisticated flavour. The dough also could also use a longer proofing time for a crusty yet chewy crust. Their mains are generally cooked very well and to specifications. Usually we rotate between the lamb chops, pork chops and steak and they never fail to satisfy the palate.Did I mention the salad and bread bar? It's offers high quality salad, condiments and freshly baked bread - although the variety on offer seems to shrink by 20% each year. So comparing my first jaunt at the Pete's Place salad and bread bar to today's iteration, it looks lean. But to its credit, the salad bar focuses on freshness and tries to make up for quantity with quality. If you have not dined there before, the salad and bread bar is still worth visiting. On the note of shrinkage, the main section of the lunch time buffet spread on Mondays to Saturdays also seems to suffer from shrinkage and I've basically dropped Pete's Place as lunch buffet place since my last luncheon there. But being a patron of other outlets within the hotel, I gather this is a hotel-wide exercise to cope with rising food and operating costs
4
Have been a regular for their full lunch buffet for many years. Most of the time I always leave satisfied and sated. Lunch today was no different. Love the Salad bar with their olives, sun dried tomatoes, sun flower seeds etc and their accompanying dressing. Ooh and the bread spreads (if u are like me who loves bread) is nice. The fruits are always fresh and succulent (yes u heard me) plus the extra desserts. The full buffet comes with choices of meats and pasta. Ending up with tea or coffee. All for $35++The staff is attentive and friendly. And if u spend more than $60 (I think) u get complimentary parking. Oops I better not oversell this place because it's aways full
5
We have used this Restaurant for many years. Great lunch and staff. Fantastic venue. Great value for money especially the free flow Prosecco and wine.
5
Nice ambience, cozy restaurant, chef going around to serve food... ambient music played softly through out the restaurant.. Tiramisu is must try!!
4
Always love coming here for their salad and soup buffet. Not minding the name, included in the buffet are desserts and home baked breads.Cosy ambience for couples and friends looking for a healthy buffet alternative and conducive to have a relaxing time to catchup over.Am always returning
4
I started visiting this restaurant way back in the 1990s and the food is still just as good, especially the pizza. Lovely ambience and good service.
5
Always good food and service at Pete's place
The one thing I would change is, if the pasta station could offer more than just two pastas.
4
Visited the place on 11 March (Sat) for dinner @ 7pm with my family (4 adults). The Italian restaurant is spacious and has a good variety on the menu (i.e. Pizza, pasta, salads, desserts). The service staff are well versed with the menu & specials for today. This helps with guest like us who are overwhelmed with choices and unsure what to order. The bread is free flow and they are serve with home made butter (e.g. herbal butter, sun-dried tomato butter etc). We ordered a lobster pasta, pizza & risotto to share. The food are all tasty and pasta is nicely cooked. The service staff provided us small plates for sharing and are all very attentive. They will swiftly refill our water and ensure we have what we need. We had tiramisu to share as dessert. I've tried better ones, but the portion is relatively huge for one person and I appreciated the service staff to provide 4 small little spoons though its a one-person portion. Overall, great experience, pricing is very reasonable for the location, service & food quality. Thank you Pete's Place. My family had a great dinner. with regards, Audre
4
The quality of the food was good. And it was a nice touch for the chefs to walk around offering fresh pizzas and risotto to diners. But the variety of food could be increased and desserts continue to be available till the buffet ends
4
Old Favourite. Great salad bar with option for addition of some mains or just w dessert. Nice cosy vibe
5
should try the tiramisu..the best in town...great service...it is better to make a reservation for sunday brunch....great food, good quality..
4
Our family recently enjoyed Sunday brunch at Pete's Place. The setting reminded us of a charming wine cellar. The food was good, the price was reasonable, and the service was quick, attentive, and professional. They also give you the option to top-up the brunch price for free flow prosecco or beer. Some of our favorites were the fresh oysters, king prawns, pork, chicken, salad bar, and dessert bar
4
Dependable and rather a good value as usual. However, their salad bar appears to be a little reduced. Very sweet pineapple. Overall food quality still quite high. We will return.
4
You have to try the sirloin steak, we ordered medium rare and it was peeerfeeeeccctttttt!!!! My boyfriend was so happy that I had chosen this place for a date as he is very particular about food. We also ordered the squid ink pasta which was very flavorful. The restaurant is cosy and great for a couple date
2
As every Saturday night I took the best restaurants in Singapore guide, choose one and take my wife.I am currently finishing the dinner and cannot wait to review it, mainly so the management does something about it. It is obviously my fault for going to a restaurant in a hotel where people come and go, so they do not need to provide any quality food or service, given most people would only go once. Just like a restaurant in an airport.The good:-good ambient music, perfect to have nice conversationsThe average:-decoration and bread counter-cheap price-service was not attentive The bad:-the food. The burrata was like plastic.The stake was tasteless.The pizza, oh my lord, could easily be frozen. The oven must be decent, but the dough was not well made with cheap ingredients
5
A pleasure to dine here, as always. Staff are lovely and food is good. Attention to detail is impressive and the staff are the highlight of the place, aside from the wonderful menu
2
Trying this place after a long while. Decided to try their meat section for a change. I ordered a sirloin with chianti sauce. Asked for medium and the steak came cooked. Looking at the menubof a 200 g cut and seeing it in real time, there is no way this steak can be done in medium. It is way too thin. Took a cut and decided is not worth the try and requested for a change. So i waited. By the time my wife is done with her squid ink pasta, my steak is still nowhere to be found. Waited a while more and decided to call time as i had lost my appetite. I cancelled my order with much dissapointment about the quality of the food. The waiter was rather nonchalant about it and duly cancelled my order. I paid the balance and left in disgust. Not coming back here ever again.As an anchor food and beverage outlet of Grand Hyatt. I expect more out of this. Even Modesto offers a better quality cut of meat and better service.What has happened to this wonderful food estabalishment? Has it lost its heart and lustre? The steak + presentation is almost like it is ordered from Hans and served with chianti sauce. Utterly dissapointed
4
The restaurant is more suitable for big group dinning as the table for 2 were very limited not the best layout and the waiter were not too friendly when you ask for another seats. Food wise was nice, reasonably priced
2
This place has been around for decades. I don't understand why their quality of food is not better. They could transform this place into something great, if only someone saw that potential. In any other location this place would have gone bankrupt. But being part of the Grand Hyatt just provides a steady flow of hotel guests as well as locals who don't have much knowledge about good Italian food. People with higher than average expectations don't go there.The atmosphere is okay, though it can be very loud
5
This is one of my favorite restaurants for heart-warming Italian food. It has been around for years and the decor hasn't changed much. Don't forget the salad and bread bar! On the weekends, they offer a great buffet lunch spread
5
We went to Pete's Place for a pre-Christmas dinner on a Sunday night to Pete's Place - craving for some true Italian fare. Overall, we were not disappointed: the food is truly Italian in style, content and presentation. We really enjoyed the different dishes we ordered - especially the fresh burrata cheese, the salad bar and the soup of the day. Our main courses ranged from an extremely nice "coated cod" dish with spinach to a great wood oven baked pizza - and of course some pasta dishes. The service was super attentive and professional - with great recommendations for drinks and food selection. We did not have any wine though. Overall, the only area of improvement was the table we were given: for 3 diners it simply was too small, and we wondered if Pete's Place could not consider putting in larger tables - especially when serving quite large plates for their appetizers and mains. But with a bit of "rearranging" it was of course no problem to fit the dishes on to our table, and we all in all had a wonderful evening - for a very fair value in terms of total cost of dining. Great experience - and we will certainly be back
4
Have been coming here for years. Still good. Dependable buffet. Not a huge spread but enough to be happy. Will keep on coming! My only issue is that it's just too crowded sometimes
1
I decided to order the veal Milanese and discovered that the items are prepped elsewhere. Case on point was when I requested that I want the veal without breading. Reply was that it comes like that.This place is tacky. Possibly nostalgic for octogenarians. Tired Italian cuisine reminiscent of the 1980s
4
Restaurant is cosy & usually busy. Food is served buffet style but not too much that is suffocating. Price is also reasonable. Their soups are usually very good and goes so well with their assortment of breads.
5
Never would one think if finding a homely cozy restaurant in the heart of orchard road. With the Hyatt club card, it is really good value for extremely tasty food!
4
pizza is excellent, eggplant parmigiana , ossobuco. lava cake is simply delicious.Cosy place for get togethers,birthdays or just a romantic dinner. Love the ambience
5
There almost every month with friends and family. Always very satisfying. Now a frequent visitor, and they even know my name!!
2
It was a place I used to go years ago...it was somewhat special... I made a reservation at an earlier time slot so I guess it wasn't as crowded yet. Service was not bad initially till more people came in. Fully seated 20+ tables over at my end with only 2 servers!! Every time we put up our hands up to ask for something, no one notices? How could anyone notice when everyone is also waiting for their food?? That poor waiter should be given a pay raise!!! I can see that he is trying his best!! He was the only saving grace! The other lady waitress was equally flustered! Asked her for the bill twice and she forgot about it. Looking around I don't think we are the only ones unhappy. Well the manager, I assume wearing a coat and the guy leading customers to our seats, was just monotonous. Luckily, more managers in coats appeared when our desserts were served but they don't even know which table is which! I guess they were asked to fill in for the shortage of manpower. A little too late and seriously I don't care! Its not as if I'm having a free meal. It's a reputable restaurant so fix the shortage! I just read a couple of other customers' comments and realized that this problem is happening for a while now. I feel sad that that Pete's place has come to this. But I do like their wine selection. As for the food, I'm equally disappointed. Maybe we should have gone to Bruno's, a suburban Italian restaurant with superb Italian food and value for money!! Give that waiter a pay raise!!! (forgot to ask for his name. A middle age slim Chinese man). He deserves it big time!
4
Very Italian, nice evening we enjoyed the place will return shortly. Great selection of Bread at is self served and if you are early, the salad is available too
4
This is my third visit here, standard of food and service have always been consistently good. Early diners enjoy a bowl of salad with every a la carte main course order which was a wonderful surprise
4
Pete's Place does a really good and a healthy lunchtime salad buffet. Also pretty good value for money with the soup+salad+dessert costing SGD 28.- per person. However to ensure that one gets a good place you have to get there early @ 12 noon. Good location too, although in the absence of a lift it is not conevient for elderly/disabled to walk down to the basement. Steep stairs
5
Arrived at Pete's Place with my family for an early dinner and from the moment we stepped in, we have been pleasantly surprised. We were welcomed by staff, all clearly old-timers, who greeted us with genuine warm smiles, quite rare these days in Singapore. We offered water almost immediately. The menu selection was joy huge but even then it was difficult to choose as everything seemed delicious. After ordering, we were informed that as we had ordered before 7pm, we could help ourselves to the salad bar for free! The items available for selection were fresh and yummy! The bread bar was also excellent. While going through our salad and bread, our starters, antipasti and eggplant, arrived. I had mentioned we were sharing and of course, the server brought along little plates without us having to ask. The starters were authentic and delicious. For mains, we had the sirloin, lamb chops, squid ink tagliatelle and lobster spaghetti. All were cooked to perfection and the portions were generous! Even though we were stuffed, we had to try the tiramisu and the pistachio parfait. Again, they didn't disappoint. Great food, wonderful service, we couldn't ask for more and will definitely be back
5
As usual and expected of Pete's Place, quality food at reasonable price. Great place for a gathering with friends and family. Relaxed and great service. Never disappoints, even after so many years
4
Nice buffet lunch for my family, will visit again. I like the home made bread! Then the staff is frenly, and the environment is cos
5
Have eaten here many times. Casual, good food, salad bar and above average Italian food including pizz
5
Me and my wife were on honeymoon and stopper by Singapore for a short trip.we stumblem on Pete's Place on the food.We're italians and it's nice to get a taste of home here.The deco and food were so close like home.Well done Pete's Place. Am glad to mett fellow Italin, chef Aldo too.Keep it up Chef and the team. Grazi
4
Great food coupled with attentive service and long standing tradition of being family friendly. Great place for couples looking for a quite evening too. Love the salad bar
4
This restaurant has been in Singapore longer than I have and it just keeps on serving great food year after year. The aesthetic is in keeping with great italian restaurants you would see in movies and the flavors are great
4
It's a rendezvous for my family and good friends. Service have been good all the time. Our favourite is the salad and soup buffet: Fresh greens, nice soup and cheese and bread and good dessert. Oh...the coffee is good too!They used to have these sauteed mushrooms marinated in herbs and garlic in the salad bar, which goes very nice with the greens. I do not see this item for the past few visits to the restaurant. I hope it will be on the salad table again.Thank you
5
Sea bass with potatoes crust! Yummy! the fettuccine crab meat, pizza and lavacake is a MUST! Thank you Chef Aldo for the recommendation
4
A nice restaurant...not the best Italian in singapore but certainly ok. Good range of dishes, nice buffet style starter if you want it. Service goo
5
What an amazing place!Was really a tasty experience!Chef Aldo Chiloiro is an authentic Italian master in the italian cuisine!Thanks Aldo and Pete's place
5
Went with a few of my friends. The pizza burrata was terrific, a hidden gem for italian food in singapore and right in the middle of the shopping district. Also tried the chocolate lava cake and it was great. Chef Aldo and the manager Mehmet were also very friendly and helpful
2
For starters, the portions were considerably small. We had the burrata and carpaccio that were alright, not fantastic. The squid ink pasta and crabmeat pasta were very underwhelming. Squid ink pasta did not come with squid ink and tasted like mee pok ta and had cut up chilli in it. Service was alright, quite understaffed.The only thing that salvage the meal was the very wonderful chocolate lava cake- best I've tasted. So, only go there for the walnut raisin bread and lava cake. Have pasta somewhere else
4
Service was superb. Decor was good. We were quite taken by the variety of breads we could get and the gigantic cheese on display. We were out celebrating my mom's birthday and my parent's anniversary. We loved all the food we ordered. The kids liked the pizza, the adults appreciated the affordable selection of red wine. A good place to dine for the entire family
4
A hearty Italian meal at a reasonable price tag. Especially recommended for wine lovers, as that's how the Italians like it with their meals. Perhaps the range of sorbets could be improved upon, but that is a minor gripe compared to their mains and appetisers
4
It's a nice place for gathering. Food is really fresh and even organic ingredients used. Am impressed. The serving portion is large and good for sharing. Thumbs up to to Chef Aldo and the restaurant manager.
5
Great dining place for a Friday dinner - food was good and the place was not too crowded. Attentiveness of the staff might be a bit lacking as we needed to wave at them a number of times before getting noticed, but overall is not an issue. Special mention must be given for the dessert - the lava cake and the pistachio ice cream are must-tries
5
We usually will go to Pete's Place to celebrate our anniversaries. And again, last visit (last week) was indeed a happy experienced. As always, food served are tasty and hot, good portion. Staff are friendly and very attentive to kids. Will sure come agai
5
Went there for a gathering with the friends. Everyone were pleased with the setting and food. Very nice rustic Italian deco. Love the pizzas and ravioli. A must visit! :
5
We decided to return to Pete's place to celebrate our Mom's 69th B'day. We hadnt been back for years because of my mom's immobility to take the stairs down BUT we began with a surprise; there is a lift service (we just had to ask).. Then the waiter's Donna, Paul & Nino were all providing service with a smile... The food selection still had its usual BUT the quality is MUCH improved with a wide selection of Seafood. Great Pizza made in Pete's Clay Oven, warm soups, and a variety of cold cuts to warm Barramundi. Then Mehmet ( Outlet manager - whom was always walking around) added the "cherry" for us, he went beyond the call of duty and made the birthday very special for us all! .. Thanks Guys.

I'm not really an Italian food lover but I do enjoy occasional pastas and pizzas. First the ambiance is good. It's spacious and quiet. Like old countryside style. The staff were alert and friendly. Food is the main thing. It has decent varieties of pastas, pizzas, cheese, bread, salads and desserts. I really enjoyed the pizzas. The crust doesn't taste too hard or thin. It's bake over fire stove than using oven. Though for buffet their varieties are not that much as compare to some hotels, the main content of the dish is cheese and one can get filled up easily. For 2 hrs, I didn't managed to go for a 2nd round but I already find it filling. Hence I think the varieties are just nice. For the price payed for one person during the weekend, I find it reasonable. Great place to go once a while

The food is good and fresh but setting and interior could be improved , The service is not as good as the other restaurants at the grand Hyatt. Pizza and Meats a re very fres
5
Excellent pizza burrata (crispy and aroma is very nice ) risotto with green asparagus and prawns was delicious too ( very fresh and tasty) and heavenly lavacake . (Must try)And special thanks to superb Chef Aldo , who's very accomodating and professional.Nice Chef every food is excellent

Had ala carte lunch at Pete's Place ...was surprised at the crowd on a weekday! Service and food were beyond expectations! The clams pasta was Super yummy! Buffet was good spread even though we didn't try that. Was pleasantly surprised by the credit card 50% discount! Definitely coming back
5
Awesome atmosphere as you step down in this oasis of beautiful restaurant in e Grand Hyatt Sg. Excellent buffet spread. Good food and very friendly chef Aldo who never fails to tantalize your taste buds from the start till the end.Five stars for sure! Will come back for more food for sure!
5
Best buffet ever!!! Everything was delicious, from pastas, to salads, to roast meats, to seafood to deserts. Free flow alcohol drinks at only $100++ very cheap!!
3
The food is average for an establishment in a 5 star hotel. Used to serve better pizza and tiramisu.

Pete's Place is one of those places I go for dependable food and service. I like their $35++ buffet lunch. Not a large buffet, and usually no expensive ingredients like oysters, prawns or Parma ham, but the ingredients are good quality and the dishes are rather well cooked with good flavor. It's a sort of healthy buffet with a large salad bar and several Italian dishes. There are usually 3 pastas, 3 pizzas and 4 hot dishes. Two soups and many breads. Fresh fruit and tiramisu. And a nice cup of coffee is included. SUCH good value. The decor is pleasantly familiar and earthy. Nothing pretentious. Service is professional but could be friendlier. I remember having to wait a very, very long time for coffee once. But it's ok. I still return several times a year
3
The free salad before 7pm was a pleasant surprise. There was a good selection of greens, toppings and sauces. The burrata was really VERY delicious but the mains were sadly mediocre. My husband's seafood squid ink pasta ($29++) had overcooked prawns and my vongole pasta ($29++) was rather tasteless. They forgot to clear the appetiser plates before serving the pastas. (There was no space to place my mains so they had to put it on another table to clear my appetiser plates first
4
My boyfriend had the Club at the Hyatt card so we enjoyed 50% discount. Food was great and the ambience was homely and friendly. This place used to be a top Italian restaurant in the good old days, would agree with the food quality although it could do with some renovation now

a long time ago - 8 years ago, we used to visit Pete's just for the dessert. Over the years, it has deteriorated in standard and recently, we decided to pop by just to check it out. it has gone from bad to worst. Definitely crossed out of the list! It is one of the worst tasting Italian food I've ever had. The pasta dishes come soaked in sauces that come of a jar (it tastes like it). Honestly, I cannot believe what training it must take to produce such bad food. The salad bar is an embarrassment. some restaurants are a blight on cuisine, and Pete's is the pits.

Went Pete's Place on a Saturday evening for an early birthday celebration for my sister.Upon entering, we were greeted warmly and ushered to our table.While waiting for our food to be ready, we helped ourselves to the beautiful selection of bread. The bread are crispy on the outside and fluffy within. The butter is home made fresh, great complement with the bread.The 1st dish that came was parmigiana. Chef Aldo explained to us that it is his new dish and it is delicious! This eggplant dish is delightfully tasty with melted cheese and tangy fresh tomato sauce. My sister and I enjoyed this appetizing dish to the very last sauce with our bread. Delectable.The 2nd dish that came was green asparagus with prawn risotto. This dish is very elegant and the taste is out of this world. It is sympony of flavours that blend so beautifully together with every mouthful. Luscious.The 3rd dish that came was barramundi with potato and sundried tomato sauce. The fish is cooked beautifully. The texture and softness is just right. Accompanied with the well seasoned potato on top of the fish and rich sundried tomato sauce, they give a fragrant aroma to the fish with every bite. Exquisite.When it is time for dessert, I am filled with anticipation on what surprise my sister will have. When it came, I am pleasantly surprised as well. Chef Aldo personally presented a plate of larva cake beautifully presented with vanilla ice cream, strawberry and raspberry, lighted the candle on our table and wished my sister happy birthday. It is real heart warming witnessing the happiness on my sister's face. Of course I get to share the dessert with my sister. When we cut through the larva cake, both of us squealed in excitement like 5 year olds to see the rich chocolate oozing out. The warm chocolate is rich in cocoa and top off very well with the cold vanilla ice cream. Simply divine and yummy. The dessert ending is sweet to the palate and to our memory for the whole dinner. Sublime.Big thanks to Chef Aldo for creating glorious dishes and effort to make this birthday dinner for my sister a memorable and special one.Thanks to the manager and staff too for attending to our needs whenever we need to refill our drinks, change new utensils etc...Highly recommend Pete's Place for delicious Italian meal, birthday celebrations, dates, anniversaries etc...Outstanding world-class.

What a great place! Food is delicious thanks to the chef Cataldo Chiloiro! We will definitely be back! You can tell when there is a real Italian in the kitchen!Way to go Hyatt
4
This is a cavernous restaurant inside the Hyatt hotel. More of a hotel style simple eat place than a destination for food. Classic Italian cuisine – pasta and the like is good. The “Asian barramundi” may well be a local similar fish to that found in northern Australia
4
Love coming to this cozy place for weekend lunch. Staff are attentive and courteous. Will recommend friends to this place.
4
the place was crowded, but each and every guest were taken care of.. courteous staff, variety of food, awesome spread!

It's an in-house, all Italian restaurant at the Grand Hyatt, Orchard Road. One of the best Ravioli Astice I've had in years.Very comfortably priced, there are wide selections of pastas and pizzas available. The Cacciuco Alla Livornese is another excellent selection.Might I add, there are heaps of Italian wines you could select for your fine dining. But I'm gonna recommend there in house wine selection, the best being Illuminati Riaparosso which pairs best the excellent sea food platter, Cacciuco

Last time I came here it must have been 20 years ago - place very much looks the same. Red checkered tablecloths, red brick walls etc.Bread bar is good.The salad bar is simple but good enough.Pizzas are still great.Pastas ... could do with a tad more variety.The steak was a bit so-so and devoid of vegetables.It has not changed much but on the other hand 
3
The food is good. The prices are Singaporean. Overall, not bad. The pasta was fresh and the salad was a bit small. The bread is fresh but self serve and not completely attended to. The wine is a bit pricey so go for the slightly pricier non house wine. Good service. Overall okay experience.
4
Good food with reasonable pricing... Service is fast and efficient.Impressed with the receptionist as I witnessed how she handled a regular client without reservation in a full house situation
4
This eatery hasn't changed in decades - the same (now aging waiters), floor tiles, furniture - but neither has the food. The same good value salad bar, pizza, hot Italian mains on it's lunch buffet, as well as the legendary tiramisu. Though prices have gone up (about SGD30 for lunch), it's still good value. I haven't visited in a decade, and so am pleased to report that things have remain unchanged. I noticed there's now shaved ham and cheese at the salad bar, and extra desserts. However, the luscious strawberries have been removed from the fresh fruit section. But what surprised me most was to receive a thank you text message after my visit inviting me to revisit again

Had a pleasant evening celebrating my brother's birthday with his family on a Friday evening.Food was nice, service would be better if there are enough staff. Appreciate that the staff prepared a little surprise for my brother's birthday. Overall we enjoyed our dinner very much.
4
Was a good experience overall. Good food. Nice ambience. Only 1 thing, was a little bit warm. Maybe aircon can be adjusted a wee bit. Otherwise all good. Would definitely return. This was our 2nd time to Pete's place. :
5
We decided to come back to Pete's Place tonight for a couple of reasons, the first of which is the world's best maitre d' ☺ Aloysius is the kind of guy that makes you feel like the best regular customer the resturant has. Or, that your the only table in the place. Quite the opposite is true of this first class Italian eatery of course. It's enormously popular not only because of Aloysius but also because the food is classically splendid. If you're looking for somewhere to eat great Italian food whilst being made to feel supremely special, look no further
5
This is the place to go in Singapore for all the Pete's so for Pete's sake don't miss it, you won't be disappointed.
4
A cosy small dimly litted Italian restaurant at the basement of Grand Hyatt Singapore Scotts Road has proven to be one of the oldest surviving hotel restaurant that still could maintain it's charm, quality and taste surpassed most Italian restaurant in the region.The food served are fresh , authentic tasty and fast too. Service staff are friendly and cheerful professional and the restaurant atmosphere is lively and welcoming.Highly recomnended for special small gathering and function here
4
Went there with a few friends for lunch. Had the buffet. $35 SGD and was outstanding value. Great selection of main course choices and breads. All fresh pastas and pizzas, salads and nice drinks menu. Nice Italian atmosphere also and pleasant hosts.
4
Friday night got a 5*, and the kids loved it so unusually for us we returned on Saturday, which was definitely a 3*. They don't seem to cope so well when it's busy, and we were left waiting with food arriving uncoordinated at different times (unlike Friday) and of a lower quality than the night before (hurried? different chef?), along with a very slow service (again, unlike Friday) where we and other diners were waving to try and get the attention of the wait staff.Friday fabulous, Saturday not

I decided to choose Pete's place for this year's Mother's Day outing. At $98++ (alcohol included ex Champagne) it' represents very good value for money.While the selection is of course more limited than other more expensive brunches (think Basilico / Mezza9 etc) but nevertheless still offers a good selection of starters/seafood/main dishes (lots of pasta!) & deserts. The staff were very attentive, smiling and genuinely pleased to be of assistance to our requests, mainly for more prosecco!. We arrived at 11.30am and left at 3pm - it's a nice atmosphere and not freezing cold which makes a difference from other brunches which feel they need to blast arctic levels of aircon to justify the $198++ price tags.This was my 4-5 time attending Pete's place & somewhere I will return again
5
This was my 2nd visit & the service was sublime. The food was good, but the good meals quickly taken after about 1.5 hours (Lobster/Crab/Salmon). Luckily i was there early before the crowd. My wife & i had the free-flow Prosecco which was a bit dry but tasty nonetheless. The service was great as our glasses was always topped up with Prosecco without being asked.Definitely a good place to come back for special occasions
3
Went for the lunch buffet.The quality of salad items were better 2 years back. Quality has dropped since. Less quality items such as artichokes and brussel sprouts. This might be to keep costs down. But I'd rather they increase the price to maintain quality
5
Visited Pete's Place for the lunch buffet with my wife for the first time.The spread was decent. The variety of bread was great; though it would be even better if they offer more spread for the bread.Mushroom soup, snapper, pasta and pizzas were good as well. Service was excellent and prompt from all the service staff I interacted with.Enjoyed our lunch thoroughly, and we would be visiting again in the future.Kel

Located in the hear of Singapore at the Grand Hyatt, Pete's place is a very authentic Italian Cuisine eatery. The chef and some of the assistants are from Italy and oversee the kitchen and do a great job cooking and managing it. It is on slightly on the higher end but you will get some great Italian chow
4
This restaurant is located at Hilton Hotel. Not easy to find it because signs are not clear but once inside you feel to like in a old-fashion italian restaurant. Food choice is limited but all dishes are excellent (only dessert is not that special!). Good balance quality/price
4
Nice Cafe for a relaxing dinner, located in Grand Hyatt Singapore, with a lot of delicious menu to consider
5
Odd to find an Italian Restaurant in a Singapore hotel but we ate there on our last night and had a great meal.The maitre'd was a wonderful gentleman who made us feel very welcome. Looks like he might have been there for years. Perhaps he's Pete!Great minestrone and home made pasta. Yum
2
Visited today this restaurant along with a friend of mine and ordered spaghetti arabbiata..waited for the course to arrive but unfortunately penne arabbiata arrived. I pointed this to the senior waiter or rather he was the restaurant manager and then he immediately apologised and brought me spaghetti arabbiata in no matter of time  Honestly food was horrible the gelling or arabbiate sauce and spaghetti was not at all there and when the manager asked for the feedback I said the food was horrible but then then there was no gesture shown from his side either even to offer something complimentary or to remove the spaghetti from the bill. Truly not a hospitable atmosphere
4
We had the flank steak and mushroom risotto. Free flow of complimentary bread. Love the sun-dried tomato butter and olive oil-vinegar dip. Food is up to our expectation, service from Nino is superb. Would come back to try the value for money lunch buffet.
4
We frequent this place for the lovely soup and salad. We noticed that there are regulars here. Better to go with a reservation.
4
This place serves Italian food and is located in Orchard Road at the Grand Hyatt hotel.They have a extensive list of wines which would appeal to wine lovers. Food is pretty good and rich. Pizza - Quatro Formaggi is awesome and so are the cold cuts. Loved the desserts as well and the lattes. Tiramisu and the red velvet chocolate cake
5
Despite many new Italian restaurants mushrooming around Singapore, this still holds its own. The interiors are still cosy without showing its age. Turn up before 7pm and you have a complimentary go at the salad bar. The lobster ravioli was divine, as was the pork loin
4
First time having lunch buffet here. Quite a good variety of food. However, I do agree with my daughter that it would be more awesome if there were a live cooking station for a customized plate of pasta..
4
Overall, the lunch buffet is extremely value for money given the quality of food items. Excellent breads, condiments and salad items. However, desserts were a big disappointment.
4
We visit Pete's Place each time we are in Singapore, it seldom disappoints. This Sunday was a good one, not too busy, good choice of salads, we all had a lovely lunch. Good place to pop into if you are shopping on Orchard Road, always has a lot of Singaporeans eating here
4
I've been coming here for 15+ years and it never fails to deliver. Full range of Italian delights and one of the best Pizzas in Singapore. Very popular with the locals and an in place for families. Affordable food and wine list.
1
Saturday night, place full, 2 chefs, 4 waiters...took over an hour for pizza. Why don't they just stop letting people in if they can't get the staff??
4
While the flank steak was tasty it was a bit on the tough side. Quite disappointing and surprised that it wasn't cooked better.The pork lion on the other hand was superbly done! Worth it!
1
We made reservations for table of 5. Had 2 persons with some VIP card and having a special deal. As it was a friendly gathering we wanted to sit together. We asked to put 2 square tables together to accommodate which will not even affect the walk way for other clients. The restaurant manager insisted we had to split tables. We ended up 2 in one table and 3 in another. His basis? Some sort of rules. My view? Extremely robotic. Even when I am Japan and the restaurants use self service orders I felt they were more personalized than a human being here.For food wise , I can't really comment . They spoilt my appetite even before I started eating with their robotic behaviour. I felt their behaviour resembles seemingly like the prison wardens in the movies I watched. Will I ever go back on my own again? Never Restaurant dining is a total experience. Otherwise it should be a food joint or a hawker stall.
3
Generally pleased with pricing, serving as well as service.However, surprised by the $6/= honey price tagGiven that the food bill exceeded $300 - we would expect the 28g. bottle to be complimentary - whether we use it as bread spread or adding a dash of taste to our water. Believe this would be value-add since the petite size bottle is usually placed at each table for breakfast / buffets
4
Pete's Place in the basement of the Grand Hyatt is a little gem. It’s part of the Hyatt hotel so you get all the great service the Hyatt is famous for as well as a the quality of the food you expect of Hyatt.We found the Italian fare they serve up in Pete's Place to be of a great quality and the price is fantastic. Even the free flow which is under $100 is amazing. For those people who know Singapore brunch prices and experiences you will know what I mean. Can't wait to go again
5
I've been to Basilico many time and as usual they didn't disappoint. Most outstanding was the service. Our wait staff was very attentive and she was able to cater to our needs. She was especially attentive to the children, helping them in and out of their seats of her own volition. The variety and quality of the buffet was once again outstanding. I like their attempt to add some CNY flavour by including things like char seiw and glutinous rice. Will definitely go to Basilico again.
4
Food was decent, lunch time buffet had good variety. Definitely convenient if you're wanting a break from Orchard Road
4
Been coming here on and off over the last 20-25 years and still love the place. Best salad bar and yummy pizzas. Nice ambiance and great service. Our reservation was at 6:30pm and if you order before 7pm you'll get 1 salad complimentary. Great value and will definitely come back. P.s. Love the free mints they give out
1
Overall a very good meal with not very happy staff.They even forgot to bring out my dessert when they were about to close
3
This is my second visit in a month. What is clear after 2 visits is that the food is on the whole pretty good, and the ambience is lovely. This place has a very pleasant, warm and cosy feeling to it, giving their customers a homely environment to eat in without losing its classiness. The price of the mains is also surprisingly reasonable although the appetisers are a little too pricey or too small. The first time I dined here happened to be a weekday and service was more than adequate and we were served far more efficiently then expected. Based on the first visit, this would have been a 4 star review. However on our second visit, which was a weekend, our mains took 1 hour to arrive. Staff were stretched very thinly and they were constantly hijacked by waving hands all over the restaurant, with many customers trying to get their attention. To be fair, the staff were trying their best and were still polite and smiling, but the long wait for the mains and the difficulty to get service made the night an arduous one. On the whole, I do still like this restaurant for its food and it's pleasant environment but a 1 hour wait for food makes it difficult to decide whether to return.
5
Staff were friendly. We were there to celebrate a birthday and if the restaurant could drop us a complimentary cake on this special occasion like how some other restaurants do, it would have been perfect!!
2
Petes Place was a great place to come, unfortunately the service is greatly lacking. I was too busy raising my hand, glancing to get someone's attention and finally had to walk up to the hostess to get some assistance. All she did was tell me how busy they are - not what I would have expected. I hope this is a one off bad day - but the arrogance needs to go away. The food was ok but the service was extremely poor.
5
I'm so happy that my boyfriend enjoyed his birthday dinner at pete's place. He loved the cioppino seafood pasta a lot and it was totally worth the price. Thank you so much to the staff for making it a memorable one for us.
2
Waited for more than 30min for starter, 1 hour for main course. Water took 20min to come. Nobody attended to me despite that I kept raising my hand or called them when they walked past. Even the table behind me got their food earlier than me despite that I sat down and ordered first. Felt that I was being ignored. But at the end of the day a waiter served me tiramisu to apologise for the long wait, which made the dinner ended on a better note
1
I was impressed that they called me in the afternoon to confirm my reservation. Knowing that I am celebrating my hubby birthday, they mentioned that they will sing a birthday song and prepared a tart. When we reached the restaurant, we were pleased with their service level.After starter, we waited quite a while before our main courses served.Later after meal, we ordered a dessert. Without clearing our table, a waitress brought the dessert to our table, knowing no space for her to put, Guess what, she left the dessert on another table (which was not clear up too) and come to clear our table. After that, she served our dessert, which was placed at "that" table for sometime. That's a No No for me. Never expect such service standard. What worst? Where is the birthday song???This is the worst dinner we had for my hubby's birthday celebration. Will not go to this restaurant anymore. Such a disappointment.
5
Food, ambience, wine and service were stellar. Variety was limited but quality made up for it. Overall a very pleasant experience.
5
We have been to Pete's Place for brunch for over 5 times and each time we are not disappointed.There are a lot of varieties of food and they are well cooked. This trattoria style like cosy restaurant is inside the basement of Grand Hyatt Hotel near Orchard Road. The service is good and there are a lot of varieties of food and they are tasty. It is one of the best value for money for brunch
4
Its been a long while since I last came to Pete's Place. I found the standard a little subjective and hence have given this place a miss. A last minute invite from a close friend saw me revisit Pete's Place. Zac was great on the restaurant floor. He's candid and manages the guest very well. Chef Andrea was super polite and I loved some of the food I tasted that night. Lamb was superb. I loved his pastas as well. And I think the both of them are really starting to re-establish Petes Place as a good viable dining option! Salad bar was superb as usual! Thank you for a good experience
3
We live nearby and have been here a few times over the past few years ... Unfortunately the first time was the best and things have deteriorated especially this year.Today we ordered some pasta which was completely flavorless. They made another portion which was jist slightly better after we added pepper and some cheese.As we left, we decided we will not be back. There are much better "average" Italian places around..
3
Recently was given this as a reference within the Grand Hyatt after arriving. For local families it seems fine but there are a few things I do not do which was problematic here. Buffet, checked table clothes, and a weak wine list. Also no top shelf liquors
1
After almost two weeks of having Asiatic food where my regular at home is Italian, I was happy to hear that there is an Italian eatery right in my hotel. I had ordered Pizza and when it was served, I had a feeling the it will be a bad dinner. I was right.. The pizza was awful..The what was call" Pasta" the dough was probably frozen . The sauce was so bland that you would not know there were tomatoes there if you stood on your nose, the mozzarella was an imitation cheese.. In one word.. Horrid.. I was so taken back that on my way back I spoke to what I thought was the exciting chef.. To my surprise, there is no executive chef just a " head cook". The guy mumbled that he would convey my complain to the owner..I have a feeling that this is another eatery, that some ex pat opened, called it Italian with a clue what an Italian food is and racking the money as most of the people are one timers..Do not go there.. Save your money.
3
Nice food. Undergrund location. Even if we got 2 expensive wine bottles, we got a very poor service.
3
This was my 5th trip for the prosecco brunch. The food quality remains very good. Unfortunately service is slipping to the point I will not return. The staff were not ready for guests at opening. There were many stations without food. It took at least 10 minutes to get a glass of water. Another 5 for a glass of prosecco. There were many times my glass was empty. We had no drinks served for the last 40 minutes and I had to leave my seat and go looking for somebody to ask for the bill. Not sure what has happened here as the staff remain the same. This was my last visit
2
Good location at orchard road, and the restaurant ambience is warm and relax. Been there many years ago and everything remains the same, a déjà vu to catch up with old memories . Read the review that the traditional spaghetti is a must try. Ordered the seafood spaghetti but is a disappointment. The spaghetti is a bit dry and hard, and I can literally eat the sands falling from the shells. Red wine is basic so nothing to boast about. However, if you were there and ordered the food before 6pm, free salad is free for customers. The tuna tastes too fishy and I don't advise to eat with other greenies
3
Nice cozy ambience and really great service! Food was good but not great considering the price we paid.  
5
Been to this place quite a few times over the past 10yrs. Love it cause it feels so homey, food is simple & authentic, and enough to leave you delighted & full! Great for family functions as well. Staff are really friendly & efficient
4
This has been around for a long time, and I last visited more than two decades ago. (!!) Food is just as delicious. Had the set dinner menu which included the salad bar, a choice of main dish, and a tiramisu. The tiramisu was the best of everything. Just the right sweetness, with a strong base. Perfect way to end the meal.Service was very friendly and attentive, though the restaurant seem a little shorthanded. I wouldn't fault the waiters though as they took every effort to be prompt. All in all, great place for an Italian evening
4
A typical Italian place with all the red and white tablecoths you need... In the basement of the Grand Hyatt in Singapore on Scotts Road, this Italian has very friendly staff, a very large and good prosecco, nice pizza's and an original menu. Prices are reasonable and the place is very big so if you're looking for something short notice, this one might be able to help you. Nice Italian.
4
Have not been here for many years but the quality is still good. We had the veal, squid ink seafood linguine and prosciutto pizza. Yummie
4
My husband and I come here every couple of months for the buffet lunch. The buffet is available Mon-Sat from 12noon to I think 2.30pm.We love the variety offered for the salad and the freshly baked breads. We'd probably stop coming here if the restaurant stops the olive focaccia.Service here has always been excellent, even when the place is packed to the brim. Aloysius, Yunos and Zack are really friendly and helpful. And they treat regulars and tourists equally well.The restaurant changed the head chef some time back and we do miss the old cioppino. The current recipe has a lighter, more diluted sauce. Not much for us to dip the lovely breads in.And the minestrone is different in style; previously it was tomato based, now ... just not so used to it. It's not bad, just that we're not used to the base.Still, we have been going back, just not so frequently because there is still the meats, pasta, desserts, soups, pizza slices etc.The main could be fish, beef, clams in shells. Dessert usually includes tiramisu, fruits, chocolate. Currently 3 choices of soup. Lots of bread. Salad may be broccoli, rocket, chickpeas, romaine, beetroot, cherry tomatoes, artichoke, asparagus. At least 3-4 salad dressings.The atmosphere is cozy. Many families, some business associates, tourists (since it is at the basement of Grand Hyatt Singapore).There is ample parking in the hotel, and if you do decide to try dinner at Pete's, order a main course between 6pm-7pm and you are entitled to a free help-yourself salad (one time in 1 bowl). Of course, bread is already included in the price.Location: Near the Orchard MRT Station (about 7-10min walk subject to human traffic getting out of Ion Shopping Mall). In the basement of Hyatt. Oh, you need to walk down a flight of stairs. I don't recall an elevator in the 20+ years i've been there)If you think this review has been helpful, do vote and let me know. Thanks in advance

my second trip to Pete's Place as we stayed in Goodwood Paek and its within walking distance. The service staff were very friendly and were always seen smiling and checking with their customers on how they like the food. The medium rare lamb chop was delicious, the kids loved the Hawaiian pizza but the spaghetti portion was small. We will return again as we enjoyed the food, the ambience. The whole dining experience was simply great!

For full review and photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/09/lunch-buffet-at-petes-place-10-scotts.htmlPete’s Place is one of Singapore’s most nostalgic restaurants. With charming rustic décor, Pete's Place is an ideal venue for any gathering with friends and family. Tiramisu is always the main highlight in Italian dessert buffet so I was very delighted to see their big bowl of Tiramisu there but somehow it doesn't taste that great. It was too over creamy and can't taste anything else... Was a little sad that their main dessert was disappointing. Hope the chef can improve in this! But their baba rum was great - Please try!Don't expect wide variety of food and dessert as the price is really reasonable. The quality of their food was quite good here! Service was great too as our plates were cleared and water was refilled quite promptly. I must say this is a Value-For-Money Buffet! This buffet is good for those people who don't have a big stomach space for huge buffet. Quality over variety buffet
4
If you enjoy free flow of Prosecco, wine and beer with your Sunday brunch, Pete's Place has one of the most adorable one at 88++. The non alcohol versions go at 68++. It definitely cannot compare with Basilico but the food was good. The cold seafood counter was fresh, loved the pastas and thin crust pizza and the desserts were satisfying. Service was prompt and quiet. I requested a birthday cake for my dad's birthday which they very discreetly told me about the arrangement. Why it didn't get 5 stars, was because when I arrived with my mom, they offered us water but when the next table of non-Chinese customers sat down, they straightaway offered them Prosecco. Not nice.
3
Pete's place is an institution in Singapore. Food is decent and fairly consistent throughout the years, which is both reassuring and at the same time, an indictment (because they don't appear to have improved as well)
4
I've been here often and I like it as a nice, Italian style local to the hotel restaurant. It is often fairly busy, but they are always friendly and willing to accomodate you. Enjoy the bread they have... yumm
5
Located at the basement of the Hyatt Hotel on Scott's Road, it is a local icon. Place has a rustic appearance and the chequered table cloth and wooden chairs are a deliberate throwback to 1980's Singapore. Place was busy but not packed.Went for the lunch buffet. Small but adequate spread of fried calamari, various pastas, 3 choices of pizzas starting with the vanilla Margherita, roast meats, Seafood (crabs, prawns, molluscs), salads and dessert. Ice cream / gelato was nice, not the usual industrial mix. There is a prosecco option which we did not take up.Staff was friendly and helpful especially with a cake that we had brought for the occasion
3
Went here for dinner with a couple of business colleagues. One of us had ordered soup which came 10 minutes before we all got our salads so the soup had gotten cold by the time everyone got their starter. We had to send the soup back to be reheated! Pizza was nothing special. I likea the complimentary bread bar but for a restaurant that's part of the Grand Hyatt it was a disappointing meal
1
I was weary from long flight and decided to go for something simple. Skimpy salad bar range, basic décor and capable, but uninspired, puttanesca. I paid by card which unusually was taken away to the cashier and I had to chase it to get it back. I was surprised there were no wireless terminals. Thought nothing more of it until a couple of days later when my bank advised suspected fraudulent transactions in India. I wrote to the hotel who stoutly protested no problems in 40 years etc, CCTV showed nothing, but they were unable to confirm CCTV covering the entire journey of my card, so that wasn't determinative of anything -- oddly the F&B manager seemed insistent on speaking to me rather than committing anything to print. This is the only time my card has been out of my control, so readers can form their own inferences. The experience and management response has not endeared me to this restaurant, hotel or the chain. Avoid

We have eaten here before. All bread and pasta made fresh on the premises. The wine is expensive (but great) and the pasta selection extensive, with lots of seafood options. They also have a kids menu. We got the $55 per head set menu which included any pasta of your choice including the $48 seafood marinara, salad bar (which had many yummy options including vegetables); glass of wine or beer and a gelato for dessert. Good value as it can be very expensive to eat in Singapore. The atmosphere is nice and cool, we had no problems finding room for our pram and it was not too noisy with fast and friendly service.
4
Always a favourite of the family's. Go for the popular Salad buffet, which is really reasonably priced, but the full lunch buffet is good too, especially if the carbonara pasta is available that day. They also have the best tiramisu in town in my opinion.

This restaurant is the grand daddy of the Singapore Italian restaurants scene, and it has been around for ever, it has never changed... This is wholesome Italian comfort food at its best, with pleasant and efficient staff, great wines and good food. The decor is spruced up from time to time, but you know what to expect every visit, the same !!! Consistency is the secret and as you go down the steps from the lobby of Grand Hyatt Singapore into the restaurant your mind is already planning the menu for the evening. Prices are reasonable and the ambience is authentic
5
Food selection and quality is excellent here. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The final glass of the free flow prosecco is served as the first. Promptly and generously. Rare to find this. Most free-flow brunch restaurants seem to get shy of pouring after the first hour or so.........The place is cosy and welcoming. Well worth a visit
5
The warm ambiance at the restaurant makes the dinner experience more warming. Me and my husband, were here for dinner. We enjoy the wood-fired pizzas and thus ordered one. Also the cod fish was amazing. The menu doesn't offer you much of choices though but that's just because the restaurant confines itself to Italian cuisine!
5
We dined here last night and explained our sons food allergies the waiter was able to tell us immediately what on the menu was suitable and what wasnt they prepared a pasta dish off the original menu to suit his dietary needs. It was great we could relax and enjoy our meal as a family instead of having to feed him before going out. The staff were great nothing was too much trouble for them. We will go there again. It was also reasonably priced for singapore. Cant thank them enough
5
Two of us were vegetarians and we got our food specially made for us. My hubby had his favourite cod fish and it was good too. Dessert was fabulous and service was outstanding. Warm hospitality and ambience was a complete package any visitor would ask for more! So what would any visitor rate after all these points? Of course...a CLEAN 5 STAR rating with a smil

Wonderful venue for a Sunday brunch. Lovely lively warm atmosphere, wonderful food, child friendly and very very good all around

Pete's Place serves quite authentic Italian fare. However, the menu is somewhat dated and for the prices, it's not exactly value for money. The reason we opted for the place was the convenience and the fact that many places were booked out that night. The food was just so so, nothing exciting. The service was friendly but left some to be desired. For the entire meal, our water was filled only once. We had wine and other drinks but the servers didn't even bother to ask if we wanted water refilled. The atmosphere was relaxed but it also felt like a self-service place - server didn't bother explaining what the set dinner entailed, we got the side plates from the bread table ourselves, etc. Relaxed ambiance but not worth the price paid for the food and service. There are other really good Italian restaurants around charging similar prices and with better service. I will not name them.

My wife and I went for dinner at Pete's Place at the Hyatt in Singapore last night. Although we have been to the Hyatt many times we didn't even know this restaurant was there. Not surprising as the entrance is hidden away down a staircase at the side of the lobby.The place has a nice traditional Italian ambience but the service was terrible. We were seated at one end of the restaurant away from the main central area and we were ignored from there onwards. Delivery of our appetiser was slow and it then took 45 minutes to get our main course. I tried several times to attract someone's attention but in the end I had to go to find someone.Unfortunately it really was out of sight out of mind and we will be putting this restaurant out of our minds in the future
4
Food was nice but not the best Italian I have ever had. Worth a visit but it is a little on the pricey side. We had a main and a dessert each and with 2 alcoholic drinks this came to 170 Singapore dollars which is about £85 in sterling. Seemed very high for we had. Service was good and the restaurant atmosphere was quiet which was nice.
5
Pete's Place, a cosy restaurant located in the basement of the Grand Hyatt on Scotts Rd, has served consistently excellent Italian food for many years -- coupled with great service and competitive prices. Try their famous Cioppino seafood pasta with lobster, their buffet salad bar and their excellent buffet of freshly baked breads
5
I had lunch here, and was really good. They have a nice buffet for lunch.I did not take the buffet and had ordered for a pizza instead and it was very good.
5
Have been to Pete's Place on numerous occasions as far as I can remember. The best thing about Pete's Place is the pizza in my humble opinion. The wood oven pizza is the best in Singapore. Other places like Peperoni, Kith Cafe, Prego come close but Pete's Place always without a doubt churns out the best Pizza. Diavola is great, juicy and meaty. We also had the seafood crispy antipasti. It wasn't that fantastic for the price you pay, could be a little crispier. In any case Pete's Place never fails to deliver a great meal! Keep it up guys
2
Went with friends and despite not being full proved to be hard to attract a waiter all evening. No information offered and only when we enquired if we could have some bread did we get pointed to the free bread bar. No interest in up-selling so we had to chase for a dessert menu. Burrata underwhelming and much better in many other restaurants in Sing. Risotto a bit stodgy. Cod was decent and lobster ok. All round disappointing and won't be coming back
4
The restaurant reserved a large section for our party of more than thirty fro lunch. This is an Italian-themed restaurant with a wood fired oven for pizza and an extensive buffet of Italian entrees with 3 soups, salads, bread, a chef carving a 50 kg wheel of parmesan and very good tiramisu
5
It begins with the fresh quality ingredients used in the salad bar. This is no ordinary salad. Marinated mushrooms, turnips, sundried tomatoes, field greens, imported hand sliced cheese, pickles beats quartered, fresh tuna ....::are but some of the many choices not to mention a handmade balsamic dressing. Add to this a wide selection of breads baked fresh daily and a herb whipped butter offering. The handmade pasta main dishes are every bit as good as those found in the Tuscany region of Italy. The spinach noodle lasagne is a must try entre. Although the menu items appear pricey, you soon recognize the value is truly in the dining experience
4
Walk down the stairs to the basement level of Grand Hyatt Hotel and one will be greeted by the nostalgic sight of traditional Italian trattoria that makes you feel as though you are coming home. There is much buzz around this enduringly popular family-friendly Italian restaurant as the food is refreshingly simple yet decently priced, especially when every main course ordered include a self-plated salad and free flow of Italian bread. Full review on www.dairycream.blogspot.comFree flow of Homemade Italian Bread and Butter Spread with Every Main CourseBread lovers like me will find it extremely difficult to resist the wonderful carbs here. The olive and sundried tomato foccacia or the grissini sticks underpin all the necessary aspects of the authentic Italian approach.The Gamberi e Nero de Sepoia ($29) is one exemplary Italian dish which the ingredients speak for themselves. No rich heavy cream but just a clear base of seafood broth that brimmed with the sweetness of seafood, parsley and garlic. The springy and fresh seared prawns and length-sliced chillis at a cheery flavour to the toothsome Italian "mee pok'"....
4
Pete's Place reminds me of family run, basement restaurants in Sicily, ones with white and red checkered tablecloths and brick walls, no windows. That's its ambience though it is in the Grand Hyatt. The staff is super friendly. They joke around and visit with customers. The manager (or owner?) greets you at the door. Instead of being Italian, they all seem to be Chinese in origin, but that doesn't seem to matter since they do Italian food and wine right. Fresh breads, Al dente pastas. Pizza. Great panna cotta to end the meal.
5
Yes! If there's one reason for me to come back here it's the tiramisu. It's heavenly. And it's always the first to need replenishment. Thankfully they do it fast, which is very thoughtful. Great selection of both warm dishes -- pizza, pasta, wagyu beef, seafood, etc. and cold -- variety of salads. Soups & fresh breads. Desserts spread is also good because there's plenty of tiramisu. I like that they make Italian dishes the way it is supposed to be -- pastas are not drowning in sauce. I consider it the buffet a good value for money. Will definitely be back.
3
This restaurant has good staff and the food is well prepared and feels fresh and home made. I think small changes to seasoning could make the food taste better which is necessary currently It feelt like they had forgotten seasoning
3
High Quality restaurant, with very nice menu, but quite expensive. Nice wine n is possible, but service is not that impressive. A servant not talking English is not what you expect to serve you and making basic mistake as serving maincourse without taking out plates from the starters. At same time not seeing that Wine glasses need to be filled up, even when asking for it, very poor servicelevel
5
Attended for a family Sunday brunch. The atmosphere is very friendly, food choice is great (salad, seafood, pasta, pizza, desserts), great value including the free flow wine
5
We really enjoyed the ambience.. and the staff were accommodating. the food was excellent. its a bit hard to find and not designed for disabled patrons
4
Downstairs at the Grand Hyatt. Good atmosphere red brick walls interior. Open kitchen. They have a huge Italian buffet lunch. Full version or half version with salad soup and breads. Had the full blown version. Four different pastas. Three different pizzas. Two proteins. One fish one beef. Salad bar sound bar breads and dessert bar with good tiramisu and panna cotta complement this place. Quick friendly service by young Korean lady which is far better than singapore average standard of service. Good if you want a gouge in carbo. Italian style. Alternatively can also order a la carte
4
Nice place to go for lunch or diner if you are in the Orchard road area and fancy some Italian cuisine. Nothing outstanding but good food and friendly service. Tucked in the basement of the Hyatt, it is easy to miss unless you look for it. Recommende
3
The steak was nicely seared and the salad bar could do more of a variety of cold dish and cheese. More thought into the salad bar should be placed, perhaps introducing more variety of lettuce would help along with softer vegetables.The desert bar was the most upsetting, the tiramisu was very wet and the cake was too dense. Service is good but food can be greatly improved. Lovely place but hope to see more changes in the future
5
Pete's is located downstairs at the Hyatt Hotel. The staff were very accommodating considering we hadn't booked for 7. Although it is a little pricey, the food, atmosphere & service could not be faulted. Be sure to try the panicotta it's to die for, the best I've ever had.
4
I have tried their buffet at so many times and it's always good.They have very good salad counter, delicious pasta and crispy and soft pizzas.....worth to visit
3
Food and service are average!The place is always busy and can be visited once during your stay.We had soups and pizza
3
Somewhat overpriced average Italian fair in the basement of the Grand Hyatt Singapore. Nothing was really good or particularly or noteworthy when it came to food. Service was ok for buffet brunch.The interior is old and needs an upgrade. My first visit was 10 years ago and nothing had changed. Same old furniture, decor, and bad lighting. Lighting should be key in this place as they have no windows and/or daylight. The suspended CFL glare bombs don't make this place very appealing and your food will look flat. Nice presentation of seafood on a ice-block of frozen flours. last words: The toilet has not been renovated since the year the hotel was build (1971), not what I would expect from a Hyatt hotel
2
If you want a nice salad with some great breads... this is it. Best I have found n Singapore. However- ordering off of the menu is always a disappointment. We have eaten here 4 times in the last year and walk away hungry each time. The beef meals that I have had are tasty but the $35 Flank Steak does not provide enough meat to make a decent appetizer. Have some wine, enjoy the atmosphere, have a great salad and bread.... but avoid the main menu if you are hungry
5
The four of us made a reservation in advance, which was good as the place was quite full on a Sunday afternoon. The soups and salads were excellent, and the bread counter plus the tomato and herb flavored butter were unusual. For the mains, the barramundi was excellent, the pork belly and roast beef were good, with the mustard and beef sauce really adding to the flavour. Our teenagers enjoyed the other items but I did find the pizza, grilled lamb and risotto about average, while the roast chicken and lasagna were pretty good. The dessert counter was superb, with chocolate and fruit pastries plus a range of icecreams complementing the tiramisu nicely. The traditional home-like ambience, attentive service and coffee after the meal added to our memorable experience; we will return soon
4
If you can't decide what you want, the lunch buffets are great! They always have good pasta, the bread is really good, and the tiramisu is to-die for
4
The set menu gives you a lot of good food for the money. The homemade bread bar alone is worth the trip downstairs
3
Watermelon juice $8, antipasti plate $29, two pieces of bruschetta $10. The antipasti was very bland - no real winners on the plate. The bruschetta was tasty but small, and the watermelon juice nice, but $8??On the bright side , the service was attentive and pleasant
5
This Restaurant was recommended by my relative who is based in Singapore. It is located at lower ground of Grand Hyatt Hotel. And it is only 5 minutes walk to Orchard MRT. Perfect location I would say. I came here last weekend with a few of my colleagues. Actually the Restaurant was quite fully booked and we didn't make any reservation. However, we are so happy when they are willing to offer us one table. The service was quite fast and excellent! We have ordered 1 appetizer and 3 types of main course (Pizza, Carbonara and Grilled Cod Fish) and one bottle of Italian Red Wine. The food was absolutely superb and the taste is much better compare to other Italian Restaurant in Singapore. They also offered a complimentary of varieties bread as a starter. Loved the atmosphere too, very cozy and of course it is a nice place to have dinner with your family, friends and colleagues. Definitely will visit the Restaurant if I have a trip to Singapore in the future
5
My husband and I visited this restaurant tonight whilst struggling to find somewhere decent to walk into that wasn't either in a shopping mall or a fast food joint and not too far from our own hotel. We were not disappointed! The bread bar where you can help yourself is a lovely touch, although don't be tempted to eat too much like me and fill up before your main! For my main I had a seafood spaghetti in tomato sauce. Honestly the nicest seafood pasta dish I've tasted and this is something i would order quite frequently when eating out. My husband had the beef tenderloin which was again a beautiful dish and excellent quality meat. We both had dessert and also a coffee for me. We didn't have wine as it was expensive and about twice the price we'd pay at home. Coffee was also expensive at £4 for a small cup. Don't let this put you off however as the food itself isn't too highly priced for Singapore and the quality you receive. All in all a lovely meal with good service and a nice Italian style setting at basement level. Thanks

Food is good, staff exceptional and atmosphere pleasant. Wine is on the expensive side, but this is Singapore and it is the Hyatt, so to be expecte
3
Had dinner there with a girlfriend on a friday evening. Place was quite crowded but were were promptly greeted, seated and served. Service was good as expected. For our dinner we ordered the beef carpaccio to share and that was lovely. I had the lobser ravioli which was not impressive. I could see the lobster but could not taste it anywhere in the ravioli or sauce. My girlfriend had the cod fish which was much better in taste and they were accomodating to her requests ( dietary restrictions). We shared a tiramisu for dessert which took 25mins to arrive. it was okay but perhaps could have been better if served without the long wait
5
Fritto misto is good. Husband had proscuitto pizza, child had vongole pasta and I had veal. They were all excellent
3
Nice salad bar and Classic Italian fare. The pizza and lasagna was good. Easy location-close to Orchard Rd.
4
This restaurant has lovely ambience and a good selection of different foods. I don't eat meat, only seafood. My children only eat pizza and pasta, my husband likes meat so mealtimes are always a disaster but this buffet made it a pleasure. It was wonderfully presented and the staff were attentive. The starter choices were great. The main courses were a bit disappointing but I usually find this in restaurants anyway. But they redeemed themselves with their puddings. A good selection and delicious!We will certainly come again
4
As we were staying the Grand Hyatt it was an easy choice to go to Pete's Place for a meal After initially being a bit confused by the explanation of the menu (language ) and the specials on offer that night we settled for a big pasta each and a shared pizza.The pasta was delicious although I cannot remember what one it was and the pizza was nice but ultimately unnecessary as we filled up on the pasta alone. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs. Good value for what we got.
4
I came here with my husband and we really enjoyed our dinner here.We had the buratta cheese to start with and oh my it pleased us in all aspects.I ordered the gnocchi which I was very satisfied with. It wasn't huge bits of potato which I am used to receiving. Small bits of gnocchi that were perfect and not heavy.My husband ordered the lobster ravioli, although he loved it, I thought the spices in it tasted like a dumpling. Try for yourself.Goergeous place, and Italian chef, you can't go wrong
5
Enjoyed the Sunday Brunch very much. Very authentic italian food. Service was good. I like especially the parma ham, its very authentic. 7 Thumbs up.

Review of Pete’s PlaceRESERVATIONSQuite easy to book on a weekday evening. Birthday dinner celebration. VENUEIts located in the basement, so no breathtaking views. However the place has a nice relaxed pub like feel with the reduced lighting. It was not full during our visit so ambient noise was not an issue, perfect for a romantic date. Airconditioning was just right at the time. SERVICEThe maitre’d led us to our seats and allowed us to choose our table. The chairs were wooden with high back rests, and comfortable to sit on. The tables were lined with red checks and paired with blue checked table napkins. The waiters/waitresses were attentive and provided prompt service. FOODFor appetizers, we ordered the Fritto misto, comprised of crispy prawns, calamari, white bait with pickled cucumber and tartare sauce. The serving was generous, and if you have s small stomach, best to hold back and save space for your main dish.I ordered the special for the day, which comprised of one salad and any main dish from the menu. I chose the Polpette di carne (homemade meatballs with vine ripened tomatoes and onion ragu), and the salad I assembled myself from the salad bar. The pasta was al dente as expected and the meatballs very tasty and filling. You can help yourself to the salad bar, and there were 4 different salad dressings available. There is also a bread section where you can slice your own bread and top it off with 3 different butter offerings. My wife ordered the Gamberi, which comprised of roasted garlic tiger prawns, crispy potatoes and rocket salad and parmesan. She enjoyed the prawns, the overall size meeting her expectations and the taste terrific.I gave the Peroni beer a try which was quite good, not too bitter for my taste and went well with my pasta and salad. For dessert we tried the tiramisu with its lady fingers and delicious espresso and mascarpone cream. Overall, dinner at Pete’s Place on a weekday evening was a pleasant experience, the place cozy and the food very filling and delicious
3
This restaurant is at the grand hyatt and my expectations were high. The place is pretty artificially rustic and the chairs uncomfortable. Ordered the Frito misto and it was way too oily and decided to close the bill. On the positive side, the service was good, especially the manager. However good service alone is not going to win restaurant loyalty
5
We visited Pete's Place for the first time last Sunday and we were pleasantly surprised! Its a real family place and great food for kids as well as the adults. There was everything for everybody! The Chef (from Milan) was absolutely amazing. He spoke to the children and took their orders from them and he personally went away and made them the pasta they had requested. He also made my parents a special vegetable medley to go with their carvery. He came over the table on a couple of occasions and asked us if everything was ok. The drinks were very free-flow if you wanted it, and the ice cream was free-flow for the kids ... which they loved! We had an amazing lunch there for my father's birthday and they presented him with a lovely birthday cake. Definitely worth a visit
4
I love the ambience and warm hospitality of Pete's, and the range of offerings for the buffet is so good - sometimes we just skip the mains! And they make their own butter - my fave is their tomato butter! They do takeaways too, good if you just want to chill out in your room
2
We are having dinner at Pete's place. Staff is courteous but despite requesting 3 times we have not been given napkins. Cutlery is missing on the tables. The restaurant is half empty still the Service is very poor.
4
Pete's Place has gone through the test of time quite well. When you feel like a Mediterranean-style lunch in a cosy, intimate atmosphere, sort of "Italian", this is the place to go. Just off Orchard Road, in the Hyatt Hotel, this is an impressive, vibrant area of Singapore.You can go for the full lunch or simply the salad buffet which includes a soup, dessert and coffee. There's lots of choice among fresh and delicious ingredients to make up your salad (including rocket, croutons, artichokes), a variety of salad dressings and a choice of different bread and special butter.The service is efficient and discreet and you can be sure of passing a pleasant hour or so. For me this is a good spot for a light lunch away from the noisy big restaurants in town. My rating would be Good for the quality of the food and Very Good for the ambience and service
5
This is a traditional Italian restaurant with good service, attention to detail and delicious food with fresh and wholesome ingredients. It's great to know that Pete's Place at the Grand Hyatt continues to place value on its customer service, increasingly rare these days!Having re-visited it today I'm delighted that none of the above has changed since I first had a meal there nearly 20 years ag
4
Friendly service and good food. What more can you ask for. Wine was a little pricey, but we are from California and therefore spoiled when it comes to ordering wine. The bread table assortment was an added bonus to the good food
4
Was here for company lunch. We like the concept that we can either select the lunch menu with just salad. bread, soup and dessert or if we are feeling hungry , the lunch menu with the hot main course dishes like fish, meat and pasta. Really enjoyed the salad station which was well stocked with a good variety from fresh salad, to eggs, mushrooms and different types of salad dressing and toppings. The bread station is also an attraction for the different types of bread and butter selections. The hot dishes comprises of pasta, sausages, grilled tuna. If you still have room, there is the dessert station with tiramisu and assorted cakes and fruits. Overall, the food was good, well cooked , good variety and of good quality. The service is prompt. Also like that retro charm of the restaurant with its typical Italian interior. Always a consistent positive experience here. Convenient location, good food at a reasonable price. Recommended

have been wanting to visit Pete's Place for quite a while...firstly because I love hotel dining; secondly because I love Italian fare; thirdly because the pictures I saw of the place were lovely. So, I decided to cave into my desire a little.The interior of the dimly-lit restaurant is rather old-fashioned in a beautiful, traditional Italian-restaurant manner, complete with red brick walls, shelves lined with wine bottles, dark wooden furniture and tables adorned with checkered red-and-white tablecloths.After placing orders, one could hit the buffet salad and bread bar.Our Mushroom Pizza arrived - woodfire oven thin-crusted pizza. Do trust that it was rather tasty - "rather" being the operative word here - I had high expectations from the great reviews. But somehow, the pizza was kind of dry and the ingredients were a little... sparse? If I may use that term. Granted, the crusts and bread base of the pizza were crispy, and the light hints of mushrooms greatly enhanced the taste of the crust... but we felt that if there were more mushrooms or the sauce used to bake the pizza (tomato, I believe) was spread more thickly, it would've been more ideal.For more detailed information and photos, check out: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-petes-place.htm

Came here for the lunch buffet. Lovely spread of fresh salad with a big variety of vegetables and salad dressing . The bread station is superb with a big variety of bread. Als like the different types of butter that we get to select to go with the bread. Also enjoyed the delicious hot dishes. My favourite is the shell pasta with beef cheek. The beef is cooked so tenderly and the pasta is al dente despite it being a buffet as the cooked food is replenished constantly. The dessert spread is great with selections of cakes as well as fruits. The ambience is warm and homely. The staff is attentive and always there to assist. I really enjoyed my expereince here. Will certainly recommend
4
This is a good choice when you do. The salad bar was very good, not the most extensive range perhaps, but all of excellent quality. We also chose the linguine, cannelloni and tomato soup, all good. Price fairly reasonable and service friendly and efficient. Waiters were all locals and no Italians in sight (maybe in the kitchen ?).Yes, the checked table cloths live on 
4
Arriving from a long haul flight I did not want to head out to the city centre to look for a good restaurant so opted to use Pete's Place which is in the basement of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised in that it was homely, the serving staff were very pleasant and welcoming, the tables were laid out informally. Having ordered the minestrone soup (which was excellent) and a four cheese pizza (just the job) I was invited to make use of the salad bar and a bread counter. Wine comes by the glass, by a 500ml carafe or by the bottle - it is a little pricey but that is Singapore! I had arrived fairly early for dinner but by the time i was eating my pizza every table was taken
4
I took my wife to Pete's Place for our Valentines day dinner. The overall experience was very good, supported by the excellent customer service, one would expect from a Hyatt based outlet. Dinner was a 4 course affair with an anti pasta platter, followed by a chicken broth. We both choose the crusted lamb fillet for main course and the finisher was a plate of 4 desserts beautifully presented as a sharing platter. Food portions were good and nicely timed with respect to service. There are a choice of breads presented on a help yourself basis. About an hour after we left the restaurant we received a text from Hyatt thanking us for our custom and hoping we enjoyed the meal. A nice touch! Price was $140++ for two, which was a little expensive but a fair price for a special occasion
4
We dined at Petes Place 25 years ago on our honeymoon. 25 Years later we returned on our recent holiday to Singapore with our sons. The décor is the same I remembers the checked table cloths. The food was nice, pizzas were great and pasta too. For it to be here still after 25 years is a good sign I would say. Price wise I thought it was quite reasonable considering its part of the Grand Hyat
1
Very dissapointed in the food, the price and the service. Felt like Italian as a change to the usual asian cuisine, nothing positive to say at al
4
Pete's Place is a favourite reliable Italian restaurant of mine ....a regular haunt when I used to live I'm Singapore and now as a tourist. Service is welcoming and attentive. The Italian meals yummy, fresh and tasty.....though I do like my pasta al dente. The decor remains the same as the service and food ....always very good
5
When I was a teenager and outside restaurants were still not everywhere, Pete's Place was one of the few places you could go for an atmospheric, cozy meal. I had my 16 birthday there in 1986 and my 18 in 1988. I have to admit I've neglected the place since then some.. only been back once or twice. But last night a dear friend and I were stuck for somewhere to eat at 9.45 on a Sunday night. We called another few places, some of which were downright rude at the suggestion that we show up after 10pm. For some reason we thought of Petes Place.The voice on the other end of the phone was welcoming and accommodating. When we arrived there were only a couple of other diners left but we were made to feel at home immediately, I was given a shawl against the aircon, the bread was as great as I remember, our seafood soups and my spinach and ricotta cannelloni was mellow and comforting and the glasses of red wine were extremely generous.We were not made to feel at all rushed, even though it was so late. It had been a heavy day for both of us but we had an unexpectedly warm and convivial evening and left in great spirits. I won't wait 15 years or so to come back next time
4
Been here twice, the second for their Sunday Brunch. It's really a good place to go with as a couple or even friends & families. The staff right up to the Restaurant Manager were quick and prompt in re-filling up our wine/prosecco. You know some places you go to where you literally have to stand up and show them your empty glass with the pitiful doggy look. I honestly find the choice of spread reasonble and well thought through espcially if you are into Italian food. It's not just pastas & pizzas, they even have a carving station too plus onot forgetting their extensive selection of breads. This is the heaven for bread lovers.Basically Pete's Sunday Brunch it's not your regular Hotel Sunday Champagne brunch where it'll cost you an arm & a leg in Singapore. It's reasonable price at SG88++ (I think) and you get the a full buffet + free flow of decent quality prosecco/ wine.For now, I'm trying hard to find an excuse to plan for the next Sunday Brunch galore in Pete's Place.
4
I've been eating at this place since I could remember but have recently increased my number of visits because of a contact who seems to love their soup and salad "package." To my surprise, I've been back there in recent times for as many as five occasions and the soup - minestrone is my fave- and salad is a guilt-free fix. We usually have a soup each (avoid the pumpkin soup), share a plate of bread (great butter though only 3 choices) and then go for the salad. The honey mustard dressing I love kinda spoils my calorie limitation but who cares, and this is followed by the dessert. I usually avoid the desserts (all good by the way) and go for the fruits. Pete's Place often serves jackfruits which are hard to find elsewhere. I suspect a lot of the wait staff have been there since opening day but they are nice, friendly and quite efficient. Overall, if you're looking for an American-inspired pasta place, Pete's Place is the place. Renovation is being planned for some time in 2014, I hope they won't change the character of the place too much or it won't be Pete's Place anymore

I cannot believe it took me so long to write this review!We LOVE Pete's place! Been there countless amount of times and making sure to visit every time we are in Singapore!Great atmosphere,with dark walls,"grandma's" furniture and checkered tablecloths and hand painted dishes. Great service,attentive but never annoying! Great food,everything that we'd tried we loved. Now we just order our favorite,Cioppino - seafood pasta with plenty of seafood in rich tomato sauce! It's amazing!Their bread is also great,freshly baked at the restaurant. And the desserts are simply divine!We'd recommended this place to so many of our friends who are coming to Singapore, probably should ask for the "refer-a-friend" discount :)

In contrast to most cities, one finds good restaurants in hotels in Singapore.Pete's Place in the Grand Hyatt is no exception,It offers good, well prepared, cooked and presented Italian cuisine without being especially high end or exciting.However, it is an ideal place to eat providing really good food at very competitive prices.Go for the self service salad bar during happy hour - this is really good

A friend had recommended the Pete’s place buffet so we had booked for dinner.The staff were inattentive and the service is poor.For the price, the selection was very limited. Quality of food was not as good as I thought would be.Fresh seafood were good. The rest of the cooked dishes were disappointing. The dessert spread are most disappointing.Not much happening and its expansive. go once is enough
5
Its has been a wonderful evening experience of food and wine.The moment you step in this place,is like going back into past..bricks wall,smell of wood burning pizza and atmosphere.A must try is theirs Filetto di Merluzzo(cod fish fillet),La cotoletta(crispy veal chop),Cioppino(spaghetti w.mixer of seafood).and lastly pizza.Price is reasonable for food,wines and drinks is abit too high..Service is fast and good,because we came in big group.Everything been served wonderfully without any miss out or slow
4
Intended to order lasagna but was told to wait for 30min which I find unbelievable. So we settled with buffet n loved the choices of salad n freshly baked breads n herbal butter tasted superb. Pizza was yum but the pepperoni I found a little too salty..
4
I took the soup, pasta and dessert buffet for 42 nett. I was pleasantly surprised that there was salad, chicken and fish fillet dishes available on the buffet table as well. Service was great. I would like to eat here again.
4
No frill Italian restaurant.. Had gamberi n my wife had their recommended seafood pasta.. Both are not too savory which is to my liking. Will be back to try their pizza next time..
3
We chose Pete's Place as it was close to our hotel and we were tired that day. The restaurant is in the basement and the interior intends to be like an italian restaurant, but are not.The set menu with Salad ( good and plenty) and a pasta dish + desert is a good choice, but the wine came late and that is a "downer".All in all a OK choice if you are fed up with rice and chinese foo

Pete’s Place Italian Restaurant at the Grand HyattThis is a wonderful Italian Restaurant. We visited this restaurant in May and were wondering if we would have a repeat excellent visit - we did! Go for the lunch buffet as it is a great value. About $33. USD with tax and service charge included. The buffet consists of a salad bar with premium greens, vegetables, croutons, seeds, nuts and dressings. Breads and special butters are very good. The main course consists of pasta dishes, chicken, fish and more. The lasagna is excellent. The desserts include tiramisu, egg custard, fresh fruit and other choices. The manager of this restaurant Aloysius Ng - call me “Al”. He is a consummate host. Special request was accommodated without hesitation. You will enjoy this restaurant if you need a western food “fix”

Got a call from a friend of mine to come meet her there for dinner on a Saturday night. Went around 8 so most of the rush seemed to be over and we got a nice table for 2 near the right side wall. The fresh bread is really nice and you just refill as much as you want. We split a salad, pasta and a pizza followed by desert and I really enjoyed all the food. I've had better but was pleased none the less. Service was excellent and the bill at $180 was maybe a little excessive but there was 4 beers included so not overly expensive. I would recommend this restaurant
4
Petes place is located in the basement of the grand hyatt hotel on scotts rd and was a favourite when we lived in singapore, the pizzas are excellent and you feel like you could be sat in italy.. the staff are always attentive and the food is always top qualit
5
The early dinner on weekend which includes unlimited salad buffet with soup is outstanding. Although italian food has choices for vegetarian this one is a winner where you have very good choices specially for vegetarians and the bread and butter selection is just superb. Very good value for money!Jet airways membership no 14262717

Love this place have been here each time for last 30years that we come to Singapore and it never fails to impress the pasta and salads are terrific and the service is very good and friendly I can happily recommend Petes Plac
4
I have been visiting Petes place for over 20 Years and the quality of the food has remained outstanding throughout.Their lunch buffet on Saturday is especially good value for money. Otherwise a little pricey for italian food
1
One starter, three mains and cans of Sprite and Diet Coke ran us $150. The service was fine but my pasta with red sauce and meatballs was bland. The Lobster ravioli appeared to be more like Shrimp Wontons, with little taste. The cans of soda at $8 each (you can get 16 cans of soda at Fairprice for that) just topped off a poor dining experience. Three thumbs down
4
This restaurant is under and part of the Hyatt in Scott's Road. The food is good and the house wines affordable.
5
Excellent food in a charming setting. I wish they would have Italian music as it would add to the ambience. It really feels like a movie set. The afternoon buffet is well worth the money. The pasta and soups are fantastic.
4
One of a number of restaurants in the Grand Hyatt.
Tthis one was good value with good food and attentive service to boot
A$135 for 3 courses of excellent seafood pasta/rissotto and a couple of Heinekens.
4
Reckon this is a very good place for Italian food. the food quality, price, service,location...etc are
all good. Moreover,if you are a member of the "CLUB OF THE HYATT", you get good discount, the club member dines free with guest(s) !

We had a very nice meal here, the pasta was fantastic and there was a nice atmosphere and good service
5
Food is so good with the quality and service. I try serveral dishes sharing with friends. Everything is perfect.

When I walked into Pete's Place at the Grand Hyatt, it was like entering a little restaurant in Italy with red brick walls and printed cotton table cloths and wooden chairs and a buffet of fresh salad. In stark, welcoming contrast to the rest of the hotel's modern, geometric interiors.We started with some hot crusty bruschetta bread topped with warm tomatoes, finely chopped shallots, basil and of course a strong flavor of the favored Mediterranean ingredient...garlic. I couldn't get enough of the flavorful tomatoes, and went in for the fresh Burrata with more tomatoes, more basil, and more garlic. This was the winning dish. It was incredible. For mains, we ate the seafood Spaghetti that I had spied on the next table during our appetizers. The snooping paid off...as the scallops, lobster, clams, prawns and crabmeat waltzed with herbs and tomato sauce. The other main was 'Polpette di Carne', pappardelle in ragu with melting meatballs. Good, comfort food.The cappuccino was the best I had tried in Singapore so far, but that was only to be expected in this fabulous Italian restaurant.And the service was excellent
5
Do not be put off by the fact that this restaurant is in the basement of the Grand Hyatt Singapore! It really looks like you are in Italy with brick walls and Italian decor. The lunch buffet is a great value. The lasagna was the best that we ever had. Salad bar with all the fixings, choice of several hot dishes, outstanding bread selections. The desserts were irresistible. Staff was friendly and efficient. You must try this one.
4
Pete's Place has been around for as long as I can recall. It serves authentic Italian food to familes who have been returning for a decent pasta and pizzas. It has a salad bar, wood fire oven and cooks pasta in the open kitchen. Some of the service staff have been there for as long as I was there on my first visit. Wine list is not extensive but good enough. Decoration is very like any Italian restuarant you can find in Italy
4
At the Hyatt on Scott's Road, the great location makes it a good choice for lunch or dinner when at Orchard Road.The restaurant has been around for 35 years that I have been patronising it!Little has changed in that time! The decor & menu remain largely the same! Wide variety of Italian pastas, pizzas, et al... Soup & salad menu options for those weight watchers & who want a light meal.Located in the basement of the Hyatt the prices are to match, but still remains a preferred option when the pasta pangs creep in!Check it out when cruising the malls in the area
2
Nice ambiance below hotel lobby but food lacked distinctive flavors. e.g. Lasagna Bolonese had some taste from melted chese on top bu ground beef lacked character and tomato sauce was incredibly bland.
3
the pizza was made with processed cheese and dried herbs, the pasta was salty and tastless, it was really expensive. I enjoyed the salad bar and the bread was lovely.
5
this is a must try italian restaurant in s'pore at the grand hyatt!! my favourite & i dine every-time i visit sg!!! simply simply wow!!!
4
Good location in the base of the Hyatt on Scotts Road. Not a massive menu but a good range of Italian food. Good atmosphere when busy, and reasonable drink prices, by Singapore standards.
4
I was craving Italian food so I decided to go here with my husband and kids. Keep in mind we live in Singapore so for right now our selection of Italian food is very limited. We thought it was delicious. The kids said it was the best pizza they ever had. Now, we did a couple of vacations in Italy so I know there is much better Italian food available in the World, but for us, living in Asia, it was a nice, delicious change. Nice decor and good service
4
This great restaurant hidden in the bowels of the Grand Hyatt on Orchard Rd right in the middle of one of the most glittering shopping districts in the world did not fail to impress! The menu is huge and the specials are excellent! The food was served hot, the salads fresh and beautiful. There is an ample selection of nice breads and of course the wine list is a step up, as usual in Singapore!The service was, as always in Singapore way above the average cut. We would try this one again
5
I recently ate at Pete's Place while staying at the Hyatt. This is an excellent italian restaurant with awesome food, great and friendly service and some of the best cappachino I have had anywhere. On this day they were serving the Sunday buffet lunch and it was excellent. The restaurant awesome has a wonderful enviroment
4
Not many restaurants survive in Singapore for several decades, but Pete's Place is one of the few. We had not been back for a couple of years, and decided to try the Sunday Brunch, which turned out to be an excellent choice, the seafood and the Alaskan crab were particularly good. It is one of those places where you can see the staff is proud to work, which you do not find in many places these days. Highly Recommended, will be back
4
Food is nice and cheesyBut too much oil the chicken ravioli is nice at the right tenderness The soup is a bit tasteless , it needs a bit flavor to the minestrone soupThe fruits are sweet and delicious the tiramisu is too dense too much coffeeThe bread is too hardThe price is too expensiveI would give a promotion if I were youOverall I will give 6.9/10Nice job by the wa
4
Went to Pete's Place for some decent Italian food, and we weren't disappointed. The menu is not huge, but they have a nice range of homemade pastas and sauces and a nice salad bar and bread selection. Staff were very friendly and attentive and the food was very good. Really like the layout - cosy downstairs cellar type feel, with open kitchen which is always nice. Didn't find the price too expensive by Singapore standards, didn't have any alcohol so can't comment on that. Pete's Place has been there for years, and we weren't disappointed - will definitely go back
1
Great location but the food was not nice and the Wine tasted off. It was also expensive. I would avoid this place, take my advice.
4
Had bread there, pizza, bruschetta, drinks, dessert, all good. Another person with me said the lobster ravioli was wonderful. Cool restaurant in general.
2
Been to Pete's for such a long time. Standard has dropped and the last visit was mediocre to put it mildly. Still a decent place but given all that is now available on this island- you can surely give this place a big miss.
5
I've been to Pete's place many times, even when I lived in Singapore for a couple of years. I find the food of very good quality, tasty and the service excellent.
4
Very nice restaurant at the Grand Hyatt- casual atmosphere but also quiet enough for a date. service was excellent and efficient. I have only had pizza and desert here, both of which were very good. I plan to come back and try the pastas.
5
Restaurant is nice, food is good and prices are normal. Just maybe the dishes are coming bit too fast. They should slow down a bit between the starter and main dish.
5
Went there with extended family and my two sons (7 &9)
Loved the food. Staff helpful.
All round excellent night out
5
We stopped to eat here on our first night and were so pleased we did. Great staff, fantastic salad and bread bar and very good menu. Couldn't faulty anything. Definately recommend it.

Nestled in the basement of the Hyatt hotel on Orchard, Pete's Place feels like you're eating in a wine cellar. Quite cozy actually. We were encouraged, but unfortunately everything after that was substandard. Snooty, slow, and inattentive service, we had trouble finding something on the menu that really sounded that good, and then when we ordered a Margherita Pizza it was nothing but a cheese pizza like you'd eat from Red Baron at your frozen food section. Huge disappointment. I asked the waiter if I got the wrong order because I had a cheese pizza instead of a margherita and he got all pissy. It wasn't even good.There was a $42.00 seafood pasta that had good sauce, but too little pasta, was just ok. The $52.00 carafe of wine tasted off, wasn't good either. Overall, a disappointing experience at Pete's Place, though the ambience was nice. Wouldn't go back
4
my first time stepping into Pete's place. the staff were friendly and the place fills up pretty fast during lunch time. my friend and I opted for the salad and soup lunch spread instead of the pasta, salad & soup combo. there were minestone soup and mushroom soup that day with a variety of bread. all self-service, by the way. the salad selection was pretty good and we actually went for 3 rounds of salad. probably the reason why we decided we had no more room for pasta. the tiramisu dessert was delicious. nice place for friends to meet and chat and chill
5
Memories of petes place are of a lovely restaurant that me and my mum - lucie Wilson - spent so many happy meals! Glad it's still going and hope to get back there someday soon
4
In the basement of the Grand Hyatt. Did not realize it was there. Food and service superb.
4
Believe it or not, the price was reasonable compared to other hotel restaurants. We all had different pizzas, and everyone was happy. Our colleague that chose the more expensive lunch buffet was also impressed with the quality of the selections.
5
Have been going to Pete's Place for over 20 years. ALways loved the bread buffet. THe pizzas and pastas and desserts are delicious. Great place for a date and works as a family restaurant too.
5
How can you fault an establishment thats been there for so long? Love the salad bar, service was good too! Pasta was the best - LOVE the crab meat linguini
4
Pete's Place has been around for a long time here. Its still a very good Italian restaurant. The local chefs here does a good job of cooking Italialn food
4
Pete's Place at the Grand Hyatt Singapore has been around ever since I first came to Singapore in the early '80. The decor is exactly the same, so it's like going back to see an old friend - in these days when anything over 5 years is torn down, re-purposed, re-built and totally unrecogniseable, I'm always happy to go back to where I know the food, service and wines are one of the most consistent in Singapore
5
My husband and I chose Pete's Place for dinner and we were so glad we did! We were greeted by out server who helped us make a appetizer selection. And helped ourselves to the bread table, every bread we tried was fantastic along with the 3 butter choices (sun-dried tomato, salted butter, and herbed butter. We both loved the herbed) We had to make ourselves stop eating the yummy bread so we would have room for our meal. I chose a spinach and ricotta pasta and my husband had he lasagne. They were both excellent. the service was great, way better than anything else we experienced in Singapore. I highly recommend Pete's place when looking for Italian in Singapore
5
Pete's Place is an outstanding restaurant. I have been going there for the past 20 odd years. I took my girlfriend who had an allergy to dairy there for the buffet lunch. The manager Aloysius made an effort to find out which dishes had dairy and which did not and then promptly cooked up some delicious dairy free fish and pasta for her at no extra cost. What great service! Despite it being a buffet, food quality was excellent. I no longer live in Singapore but I will always go to Pete's when I visit Singapore. I have only been back a week and already dined with them twice and lunch with the ladies tomorrow.Btw, NeilandAnn, all you have to do is tell the restaurant you are vegetarian and they would have gladly made you something special. With regards to wine, there is a very high tax for alcohol in Singapore hence the high cost so enough with the griping already
5
We had a fabulous meal on Christmas day. We mentioned to the manager that we were vegetarian on arrival and additional pasta dishes were cooked for us. The champagne and wine flowed througout the meal. The salad, cheeses breads and desserts were lovely. We would thoroughly recommend.
4
They have a bread bar which a great idea. The pizzas were great and the minestrone soup was excellent. The service was very good. I have been visiting this restaurant for many years and find the service and quality of food consistent.
4
A little pricey as it's the basement of the Hyatt, this place offers delicious Italian simple fare and great wines.
3
Still a place for a comfortable sit around but the food has not kept pace with newer options.
4
I love this place and I have been many times. Food is real Italian. Lunch is buffet, not bad but dinner a la carte is much better.
4
A nice and cost little restaurant in the hotel. A decent and varied menu and not too expensive. Free starter salads before 7:00pm
4
Very good Italian, expensive. Very good pasta, needs a better wine list.

In this day and age - are vegetarians really still freaks? It really is very disappointing when a clearly fine restaurant lets itself down by not offering a reasonable vegetarian range. Should I be satisfied with a pizza everytime? And whilst I am at it - what's with the price of a bottle of wine in Singapore? 50 quid (GBP) for a bottle of Chianti which could be bought in Tesco (UK supermarket) for a fiver (GBP)? I thought that this would all be down to local duty and taxes, but that same bottle of Chianti can be bought in M&S (Singapore) for around Â£12.00 - so someone, I am afraid, is racking it up somewhere.Pete's Place is OK. It's pretty bland. Pretty non-descript. Certainly not offensive. Nothing to complain about too much (see above) but certainly nothing to get excited about. I am writing this review within a few nights of dining there; or I would have forgotten the experience totally
5
Pete's Place has been around for decades and somehow forgotten in the midst of the competitions and entries of new restaurants in the market. It holds its own. There is something dignified and comforting about the place, not often offered in other restaurants. I love the rivioli dish here
4
When my family goes to Pete's, I almost always opt for their salad bar. Though it is a bit expensive, it is honestly one of the best in Singapore, and usually outdoes their main courses, in my opinion. Also, their bread/olive oil is wonderful. Their main courses aren't bad, but they are not incredible either. The service, though, is very friendly, and the atmosphere is nice
4
Pete's is downstairs in the Hyatt hotel off Orchard road in Singapore. The food is good to very good. We had the 1/2 carafe of Chianti (it was OK...not great), the Brushetta as an appetizer (very good) and the house special pasta dish called Cioppino. It was very good and the waiter, will if you ask, de-shell everything and leave just the meat which was awesome to as not to make a mess of your hands. The price was very reasonable we thought. Also, their bread station was delicious and had a nice variety of fresh breads
4
Lovely basic food I really enjoyed it and would eat there again
5
Nothing like a fresh salad bar and fresh bread with olive oil after a full day of asian food. I am a american and I love asian food but after a week or so of asian food, Pete's sure hits the spot.
3
Lunch buffet is very reasonably priced. Wide selection of breads that go very well with the herb and tomato butter. Expect a family restaurant ambiance. Food is good, pastas are not overcooked. I have been back here several times. Never disappointed.
4
Great Italian food

gd italian food. squid ink pasta!

You can't beat Pete's Place in terms of location, staff, food quality and the salad bar. This restaurant has been around for a very long time ..and rumours at the Hyatt have it that it is not to be touched for renovation. Yes they made it smaller to make room for Brix, but a Hyatt-Singapore without Pete's Place is like beer without alcohol ..just not the same. Great for aquick lunch, or better for a leisurely relaxed dinner ..a perfect hideaway with excellent value for money
4
We dropped in to for dinner at the spur of the moment after a long day; was walking by and recognized Pete's from Trip Advisor. It hit the spot. We chose the set menu where you serve yourself to the salad bar, fresh baked breads, and assorted spreads for the breads. You also pick one pasta or pizza. I chose the prawns with the linguinni dish. My husband chose the spaghetti and meatballs. The meal also was finished off with tiramasu. It was all delicious. The salad bar was perfect with an assortment of very fresh vegetables. The bread was fresh baked and I especially loved the sundried tomato butter for the spread. Both of our entrees were very good but I especially loved the wonderful flavors of my linguini dish. The tiramasu was also wonderful. The restaurant was very homey; looked like a little Italian cafe with red checkered table cloths. We are going back again before we leave. The cost was $38 SGD/person and was definitely worth it
5
This is a cozy Italian restaurant on Orchard Road in the heart of the shopping area. The food is traditional and wonderful and always served with a smile. A huge assortment of breads comes with the meal. Try the Caprese or the Carpaccio, absolutely excellent. The pastas are unbeatable. This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore and whenever I visit it is an absolute MUST DO
3
With all of the excellent dining options in S'pore, I really expected the Hyatt to have one of the top of the line options. With those high expectations, I was really disappointed with Pete's. The wine list was OK, but certainly not very extensive (or that great), the Caprese salad was actually OK with real buffalo cheese, and my lasagne was kind of bland. Service was good and atmosphere was nice. All in all, not bad, but I guess I was just expecting more.
4
Love the wide variety of bread and pasta. Love the cozy ambience.
4
Very good seafood pasta (Cioppino) - prawns are so fresh.
3
The best the 70's had to offer and still standing.
4
Nice ambience and good Italian cuisine.
5
always good
4
An old establishment serving great food.
5
Another must-try! Serves mainly Italian and Western dishes for its buffet. A more relaxed ambience as compared to Mezza9.
4
In my opinion still one of the best Italian restaurants in town. It has been around a long time and has managed to maintain its standards. Very much like a family run restaurant.
4
Decent place but not the best italian seafood pasta.
2
nice bread selection and family style italian dining with good pizzas
4
I think it's the sheer variety and quality of the bread ...even the butter is fantastic.
3
It is not as good as 10 years ago.
3
Standard a little erratic of late. Used to be pretty decent. Didn't like the pizza base though.
5
One of the best Italian food where you get good italian good with great friends.
4
nice ambience, nice food, try gg during lunch buffet.. cheaper.. =P
3
Decent pizza. PAstas alittle too salty
3
Nice buffet lunch on Saturdays for families with children.
3
A very reliable Italian restaurant that has been around for ages.
4
Petes place is a real authentic italian restaurant for sure, with their wide array of breads and anti-pasta it immediately ensures u a fine gastronomic treat. not too pretencious keeping it the italian way of simple and wholesome Pete's Place promises u the classic and the splendid.I had a stater of fine anti pastas, bread rolls. shared a classic magherita pizzaFor mains, i went for my personal favourite carbonara. Ive had a fair share of good carbonara around the island, but the carbonara here was easily the best . The spaghetti was wonderfully coated with the egg yolk cream sauce. but i felt what was the magical ingredient was the pecorino cheese that was used instead, that tantalizes ur taste buds. cause unlike other places where they either use the standard cheddar or parmesan, pecorino is the original and best cheese to be grated and used for the sauce.All and all its a must try italian restaurant. bring ur friends, family, have your pastas share your pizzas where the food compliments the ambience hand in hand
4
Italian food that is both rustic and current, Pete's Place is a stalwart at the Hyatt and will not disappoint. Somewhat dimly lit dining area makes for a dingy feel that you either love or hate. Try the freshly baked bread with homemade/different butters to accompany them
4
Authentic, tasty and reasonably priced Italia restaurant with less annoying crowd. (Applies to weekdays)
4
I love this place!
4
pretty good. reasonable priced.
4
Yummy pastas and generous servings. And the bread is great too.
3
Lunch buffet value for money. very cosy "old world" setting.
4
Been there for the Buffet...heard so much about the salads..indeed, they rock! Something about the salads that'll convert non-veggie eaters. Love the bread, salad and bread best. The pasta dishes weren't wow in the buffet...tiramisu was good.
i wanna be back!
4
nice... sweet and cosy italiano ambience... good food!
3
I didn't really enjoy the food.

Cosy
4
i love pete's because they make such a lovely $19 seafood pizza, the seafood pizza comes with a tomato base, fresh scallops, shrimp and squid toppings. Plus, i also love to steal the chocolate mint chewies they have out there at the front desk in a big jar.make a reservation so you don't have to wait. if you do have to wait then steal a few more of those delectable chocolate mint candies out in front
3
check out the buffet!!
4
Servings are big... seafood spahetti is a must try!!
3
Food is not that nice.. BUT.. Some special memories left behind..So got to say that its still a good place to go.
4
great food, good ambience, if u liked italian.

Good Spread
4

Good and ambience. Kinda expensive though.

I love the chipinno

very good

Pete's Place was fun for lunch. I ate the most beautiful and sour strawberries ever that went really well with the sweetest tiramisu. The honey mustard dressing was awesome too. But I got too full to help myself with a second round of the pumpkin soup and bread. Good for corporate lunches
