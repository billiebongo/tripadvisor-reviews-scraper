Nice place to lunch with business group. So many options of food. Price adequate for the variety of food. Recommendable.

the cakes and coffee are Ok
I love bread, but all products from Swiss bake I tryed like tast like industrial product. “Swiss” Sound like qulaitinand craftsmanship but at Swiss Bake it tast only like factory. so for me totally overpriced.

Had breakfast here a number of days whilst staying next door at the Swissotel. You have to try their berry burcher muesli for breakfast - its one of the best I've had period anywhere in the world.
Nice pastries and crossoits as well.

Great place to enjoy your sandwich at a central location, quite literally. Great tasting sandwiches are made from fresh ingredients, fast and affordable. Great coffee too

Had a vegetable sandwich in one raffles place branch. It was nice (especially the bread), however the price was the same with other non-veg sandwiches. Staffs were friendly
4
The chicken pie was good, nothing too special but the seafood chowder was better than I expected. The staff was the reason that made the visit a pleasant one. The short hair cashier was friendly and approachable, while waiting for my meal, saw the male staff with glasses offered to help another customers with his food even though it was self service. It's not easy to find a warm and cozy cafe nowadays

Our family of 4 (2 teenage sons) stayed 8 nights at the nearby Park Regis and by our last day we were craving a simple fresh sandwich, European-style, for lunch. How glad I was to find the little KraftWich Swiss-Bake shop on Level 1 in The Central shopping mall on Eu Tong Sen Street! There's not a lot of seating but you can get generous-sized sandwiches (more akin to toasted panini) that are excellent value at around $9 each - we opted for Smoked Duck, Turkey Ham & Cheese (both toasted), and Avocado & Cheese, all delicious. We also had delicious Iced Salted Caramel drinks, an Iced Chocolate and a Cappuccino, I thought everything was reasonably priced and excellent quality

I had breakfast in their Harbourfront branch and was happy with their menu and service. Swissbake's fresh sandwich concept is one healthy option to the otherwise, fattening and calorie-laden food in most malls nowadays.The idea is to serve only the freshest ingredients including vegetables inside healthier bread options while keeping the calorie count at its minimum.I highly recommend the turkey ham and cheese kraftwich set. It comes with a large sandwich on dark rye and a bowl of beef stroganoff soup, plus iced lemon tea. The set is a good match. Crispy sandwich with hot soup.I wish for more of this type of restos to enter the dining scene

This is SwissBake at The Central.Food is fantastic. Salad buffet looks great and it is affordable. A combo of oven baked salmon with salad, mushroom soup and ice tea for SG$17,90 sounds good for me, having in mind everything here is fresh, healty and tasty. Many more options available too.Coffee is great. So eas

I visited end of the last year. Sometime I had their bread in Cold storage and this was my first time visit there to have coffee and desserts. Those taste was just average. The thing happened to me was that my wallet was fell down on a floor and I realised I lost it right after leaving the seat in 15min, so came back to the bakery in hurry to look for my wallet. And the people was sitting near us left the place already. So I reported it to the bakery, Lost and found in the building and Police. And I asked to check their surveillance camera in a certain time period as I and my friend was there about an hour, the staff from Swissbake said Ana from Head office will contact me as soon as she checked. After new year, I've never get any news and updates from Swissbake, I left messages through their website regarding a result of surveillance camera. They NEVER get back to me, and ignore me and that issue. Even I gave them certain time period, they didn't do anything for worried customers. They are very incompetent and helpless.I don't want to buy and visit in Swissbake anymore. There are other options to eat in Singapore than them

I was after a quick clean sandwich and that's exactly what I got. The bread, ingredients and flavour was perfect.
The layout of the Cafe was good and very clean, service was also pleasant.
Paid SGD 20 for 2 sandwiches and a croissant.
4
Nice sandwiches and nice big portions. There are sets too and lots of little pastries to choose from. I really had no complaints. A bit of the high price but then service and food good.
4
A range of salads and sandwiches as well as fresh pressed juice make this a great alternative to the usual restaurants. Prices are good as well.

Lovely cafe for Breakfast and light lunch at Central, close to Clarke Quay.
Good selection of croissants, rolls, pastries, salads, soups, teas and coffees.
Great service, very enjoyable and highly recommended.

Had coffee and cakes with a mate. The staff behind the cashier machine seemed like in a hurry to finish serving us. It wasn't that crowded at 4pm. Lack of smile/friendliness.

Swiss bakes bread looks very promising but is a disappointment having a lack of flavour. Most of there breads contain milk making it not suitable for vegans. Overall you are better off going to baker and cook if you want the real deal!!
4
If you are a traditional Australian diner in Singapore, finding a good old fashioned bakery is always a great pleasure. So, this find in Clarke Quay doesn't disappoint: cakes, pastries, pies and pasties along with tea and coffee, and friendly service. Bliss!

Been struggling to find a decent place to grab breakfast. Anyway the quest is over. This is a great place with efficient friendly staff and great tasting fresh food to get your day started. Good for food anytime. Not overpriced either so for a quick bite or spot of dining whilst out shopping check out Swissbak
5
The food here is awesome! We walked 10 minutes nearly everyday while in Clarke Quay to eat here. Their Sandwiches are absolutely delicious, especially the Smoked Salmon. We also had their breakfast menu and were not disappointed. They also do amazing salads and freshly baked goods. Definitely worth going

After visiting Boat Quay found this outlet in Clarke Quay Central mall.It has meals, cakes, pastries, cool drinks, coffees and muffins. You can dine in or take away.This is a busy outlet, plenty of seating - right on the ground floor. The staff are positive and zoom around with orders.I enjoyed a cappuccino and muffin....recommended
4
Rich and creamy with multiple layers of chocolate hazelnuts cream. Its very rich and thick so some people will not like it, but chocolate lovers will be pampered.
Price is decent.
3
Had a juice and a pastrami/cheese sandwich here - bread wasn't bad but the juicer hadn't been cleaned so could tatse ginger and some kind of vegetable in my OJ
4
Nice place. . Awsome sandwiches. . And good atmosphere.
I recommend the roast beef sandwich. . So delicious. .
The staff is well trained
I will come here again and again

Was staying close by at the Swissotel, but most days had a quick and easy breakfast at this bakery. Sometimes baked goods, often their delicious bircher muesli. Yum.

Have a Sea Food Vol-au-vent at the NEX outlet last week. The Sea food was so over cooked that the prawns and mussels were very hard. I wonder how SwissBake do their quality control before the presenting the food to the customer. Looked like they are not able to maintain the quality they should remove it from their menu as there is nothing worst that over cooked sea food
4
Was there by chance at Clarke Quay outlet as was waiting for my handphone device to be fixed which would take a while. Had seafood risotto and freshly squeezed/blended (which is rare and surprising) fruit juice and a pastry at a discounted price during dinner time. Presentation of food and drink was good. Their sandwich looks huge and intriguing in appearance. Would like to try that next time. However, portion of food is not that generous though for the price paid. The restaurant/cafe looks bright and attractive and I see quite a few customers mostly ordered pastries/breads/drinks as takeaway. There is no service charge and you need to pick up your own utensils and get to choose your own seat

I am back at yet another SwissBake outlet for healthy, delicious food and drinks, as well as quiet ambience and friendly service. This time round, I visited the branch at Marina Bay Link MallThe Cream of Mushroom Soup (SGD$7.90) Is thick, rich and velvety, with lots of mushroom dices within the aromatic soup. Croutons added crispy bites to the soup, and it is awesome paired with wholemeal bread served on the side. This alone serves as a substantial meal.I also love their mini pastries at SGD$1.50 each - such as flakey butter Croissants with a fluffy interior, or the Cherry Rollover with a crispy exterior and tarty cherries within.The Beef Pastrami Salad (SGD$8.50) is another of my latest favorites from them. This sumptuous salad with lots of ingredients - succulent beef pastrami strips, slices of hard-boiled eggs, olives, lettuce, pickles, tomato etc, made for a healthy treat. Every bite was fresh and satisfying, and the beef was lightly salted to add flavour to the sweet vegetables.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to drop by here:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lunch-at-swissbake-mbfc.htm

Tired and hot from walking the streets of Singapore, we arrived near Clarks Quay and liked the look of the Swissbake counter. Delicious cakes and savoury pastries in a simple air-conditioned and comfortable space. Sandwiches made fresh on the premises and reasonable coffee ... solace for the foot-weary and hungry passer by. Strictly western style mainly for ex-pats and tourists

We came upon this establishment by chance. And hanging out for a drink of coffee this was the find of the day.Good selection of foods, especially the health variety, and of course a good selection of bakery items.The coffee was good and the green tea was even better

Swiss-bake is no stranger to me, from its delicious pastries to the healthy salad. What was new to me was the catching up with an old friend, *Jalpeth, the other day - and he suggested a healthy diet of Bircher Muesli.And while *Jalpeth grabbed two of the Swiss Bircher Muesli (SGD$4.90), I grabbed one. He started explaining the benefits of this very affordable and delicious food item - probiotics, antioxidants, etc etc, good for cleansing the system and fighting cancerous cells etc, over catching up.I was happily enjoying my rolled oats, yogurt, chunks of fruits (grapes, berries, etc) all mixed into one hearty concoction, excellant in taste and texture collectively. It even made me feel healthier, more radiant after eating this healthy breakfast dish. And the best part was that it kept me full the whole day.Not one to do without any form of liquid at all, I also had a Peach Cobbler Yogurt drink (SGD$6.90) - it was an iced blended but melted readily in the mouth in soft waves of peachy dreaminess. The flavor was not too strong, and it was all right for me despite the fact that I am usually rather lactose intolerant.For full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/10/lunch-at-swiss-bake-cafe-international.htm
