The restaurant had no foreigners until we sat down but it only had 1 table empty, total local place.Ate here twice for a snack and a full dinner and wished we could go again. We had a wide range of items from the menu, each of which was full of flavour and so tasty. The service was really good too and drinks were cheap also
