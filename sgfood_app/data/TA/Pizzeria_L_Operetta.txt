It is rare to find a good marinara pizza outside of Naples, Italy, but Pizzeria L'Operetta does a very good job. The second time we ate there we also got a good salad, and a surprisingly good tiramisu.

The pizza here is good - one of the best places we've found in Singapore. The service really let's it down though. We visit fairly frequently as we live near by, but each time we do we always find the host very rude and unhelpful.

I love this place for Pizza, the wood fired oven makes a big difference. It is a great location if you are in the area therefore good for local and expats living close. They do a good takeaway but dine in fresh is best.

It seemed as if they had run our of ingredients and made our pizza with a blind fold on. Cheese only in the very centre and very few toppings in clumps some places and missing all together in others. I showed the man in charge as if it were my establishment id want to make sure everything was a high quality and everyone was happy and he didn't care

Really good homemade tagliatelle with tomato ragu sauce. The place doesn't look all that from the outside and I assumed it would be trashy tourist food but it was far from that. Absolutely delicious and very understated. The pizza was great too, traditional pizza oven. Give it a try

Though I pass this resto on a daily basis, it is my first time to come in and try their Capprichiosa pizza. What surprised me was their beautiful pizza oven and their process of making the pizza. Freshly cooked in 10 minutes roughly. Quickness and quality. Pizza taste was so good that I ended up overeating and finishing the entire pizza. Will definitely be back.

This is an average tasting pizza restaurant.I had higher expectations due to its certification for Naples pizza and following a set of standard specifications. The taste of pizza is not as good as it comes. I was the only customer and Quattro formaggi Pizza that I ordered arrived within a few minutes. It was not crunchy enough even though it came out of wood fired oven.I would only go there in case I am around as it is not worth a special visit. Price of pizza that I had was 30 sgd which is 4-5 SGD more than some other restaurants that has better tasting pizza

I'm very picky about the pizza I eat, as I've spent a fair amount of time in Italy and value well prepared traditional style pizza. This comes very close! I always order the marinara, as it is so simple and delicious! My partner also says that the margarita is great, though once it came out with the mozzarella not melted sufficiently. The house wine is fairly affordable and very tasty. The setting isn't great as it's in a shopping mall, but the food makes up for it.

Pizza is decent which is why I give it a 1 star. Reason why I would never go back again though is because I ordered a pizza + spaghetti and meatballs takeaway, only to find out that they forgot the spaghetti when I got home. Pretty bad as it is given such a small order to forget something when not busy.. but.. happens. when i go back later to get a refund for the spaghetti and meatballs, the owner would only refund me the portion for the pasta, not the meatballs... hmm.. maybe i was just expecting too much that I should get a refund for the entire dish? needless to say. over $15, the cheap owner has lost a customer for life

I've tried a bunch of pizza places but L'Operetta is still the best so far here in SG. Unfortunately, the nice branch @Boat Quay is closed, so i have to trek over to Icon Village to get it - spoiler alert: the dining room is blah, just focus on the pizza.

Had lunch with friend here, definitely the best pizza I've had ! The crust, the simple ingredients, everything was really really good ! We couldn't help ourselves but order one more after we finished, it was just so good !

We frequent pizza places and so I could only give this three stars. It was expensive...but they do have early bird specials that cover
some simple pizzas if you arrive then.

Finally checked this place out after living in TP for a year now. Disappointed at the quality of the pizza, base was not cooked through which ruined it for me. Much better options for pizza in TP in my opinion.

Cheaper than the other places in Singapore and absolutely the best pizza we have tried here! Delicious simple pizza margherita (18 S$) and burrata. We felt Naples's atmosphere.

The title says it all. A pizza should be simple with the best ingredients, not full of salad or other novelty toppings. This is as close to pizza from Napoli that you will get in Singapore.Where else in Singapore will you see a pizza cooked in 90 seconds, as it should be, similar to a naan bread in a tandoor oven if you want a similar Asian reference.The restaurant is in a shopping mall, so not the best place to hang out, but for the best pizza at reasoanble prices, good for a quick lunch or dinner

First time here. We ordered two 12" pizzas to share from the set lunch menu. The set lunch includes a salad and a drink. The salad was too salty. The pizzas were served at room temperature, shouldn't fresh pizzas be served hot? The ingredients were miserly drizzled over the pizzas. The pizzas were soggy. In short, the pizzas were edible but that's about it. Just good enough to fill the stomach, but nothing satisfying. Disappointed!!!

There is a one for one special and i had a cheesy quatro to eat and a meaty mix to go.The quattro had really strong blue cheese and parmigiana flavour and if you are not used to strong smells (as with a westerner smelling Durian for 1st time , quatro could be a turn off!)the other pizza to go turned into a glob and as mentioned by other writer due to perhaps too thin base n heavy ingredient leading to a meltdown mess by the time i reach 25 mins later. perhaps they should learn from Pizza Hut how to package your takeaway pizza.To those whom had not tried pizza in italy , australia or Usa, please refrain from misleading others and said 'this is the best pizza there is in Singapore'Average but better than pizza hut if they don t use too much processed cheap meat for toppings

Vaguely remembered that there was a restaurant of similar name that won a certification where they cook the pizza for 90s in a wood fired oven. it must not be this one!They did have a wood fired stove. And a totally empty place (albeit on a Saturday night in the CBD), but I should have known. Pizza base couldnt hold the toppings because it was soggy. Crust was mildly burnt, but tasted very burnt. Between the crispy burnt taste and the soggy wet base, I don't know which was worse. I think my biggest regret was I convinced a companion to eat there with me. Thanks but I won't be back

Went there for pizza and a beer, had a Margherita with bufala. Pizza was very nice and thin (that's how we like it in Rome!). Tiramisu was very good as may be found in Italy! Price is Singapore standard for pizza, that is high, but I've had pizza in other places in Singapore which was as expensive but not as good.

If you had real Neapolitan pizza, it's hard to get used to pizza hut and dominoes like. It's so hard to find that you would almost give up all hopes.Surprise surprise, here in Singapore you can find it.All I had was one bufala margherita and a beer. It's very expensive (Singapore$25 for one pizza) but it's worth if you are looking for something special.Thums up.

Expensive and stingy on ingredients . The crust was thin and soft . Nothing great at all. There are better options elsewhere

Probably best pizzas in Singapore, true Neapolitan style. The pannacota is also quite decent.
A couple improvements would make 5 stars: make the pizzas a bit bigger and improve the decoration (if you don´t spot the oven, it´s hard to say it´s a pizzeria)

We had dinner at L'Operetta with our four kids. Food was delicious. We tried the 4 cheese pizza (yummi), the carpaccio and the foie gras, all cooked to perfection. Try seating at the terrace to enjoy the ambiance and the view!

Didn't got chance to eat nice pizza when my hubby and I in Italy. However, Pizza here in Pizzeria L'Operetta is the best within Singapore. I just read the article about them this morning and found out they are the only VPN certified pizza sold in Singapore. No wonder the taste are so juicy yet very bendable. The dining place is always not so crowded, the service is very attentive. Somemore the price of the pizza is very very reasonable. You really do not want to miss it

The pizzas here are delicious and consistently good. We have been a few times and would really recommend for the food. The ambience isn't great and it is not really the best place to sit and eat, but we get takeaways because we love the pizza so much

This place is by no means your glitzy, posh restaurant. Instead, it's a quiet place for honestly great pizzas, pasta and dessert.I ordered a classic Margherita pizza, Aglio Olio Gambino and a tiramisu, and while I paid a bit more than I anticipated, it was worth every cent.The pizza has a lovely texture to it. - solid dough base with a good charred flavour that's also not too thick, a rich base and ample toppings. The pasta was done the classic Italian way. None of your bland oils and overpowering ingredients - the olive oil used here was flavourful and rich-bodied, yet infused with the soft aroma of the garlic in the dish. The prawns had a good bite, but since I like it a little spicy, I added were a few dashes of chili flakes.The tiramisu had me worried at first, but watching the chef actually whip the mascarpone upon ordering was a nice touch. Texture wise, nice and flavourful with a generous dusting of powder atop.The ambience was a little meh. Being open-concept, you'll have to put with the random gaggle of office girls guffawing as they walk by, or the chatter of the office ladies dining at a neighbouring restaurant. Come after 8pm and things are a littler quieter and a little more pleasant.The staff are attentive - my only wish was that they were able to make special order requests. But that's a small notch in a sterling serving of classic Italian food

I come to L'Operetta often, since I live nearby. The place is never full, so finding a seat is easy. I go for a classic, simple Margherita most of the times, and it delivers (I lived in Italy for 3 years). However, every time I go there, I keep wondering how much better the place could be if the chairs and tables were a bit better, if the tables were covered with linen, and if the lights were more indirect and cozy (better for a couples experience). That would make the whole experience that much better

I have been here several times now.I like this restaurant because it is unpretentious. The staff are super attentive, and the food is of consistently high quality.The Wagyu Beef Tataki starter is amazing. The Buratta cheese with Ham also excellent.The pizzas are fresh, not too thin, not too thick, and you can order off the menu pizza too.Sausage Pizza unbelievable.Itâ€™s a bit pricey, but at least you know you are going to get a really good feed and great service

We visited the outlet in Circular Road for lunch today and chose the Marinara pizza (at $12) and the salad (at $8). Both were quite ok for the price, but we were a little disappointed that there were no items of seafood at all on the pizzas. Popular venue and we were lucky to get a seat shortly after 12pm

I've just been there for a short dinner with my friend. This place has a really good pizza! I think the fire oven makes absolutely the difference. Only negative point: S$ 25 for one pizza is a bit expensive in my eyes... Nevertheless i will definetely come back. Great place to have dinner before going out
