It does the job, good old-fashioned Singaporean chicken rice. The rice didn't feel overpowering which is a good thing. Unassuming restaurant, not much for ambiance as you're expected to just get a quick meal here.

Tasty Chicken rice which is their specialty, there are also other dishes like sambal morning glory also very good, service fast , people just come sit down order and eat and leave. no aircon, just openair. typical old fashion style eateries.

We ordered roasted and steam chicken. Both types pretty good, not juicy (like we expected) but tasty. The price is very cheap.

Quick and friendly service. Good fresh food. Nice juice drinks. Good price. Prefer the roasted chicken. Could eat there everyday. Greens done nicely too.

The chicken rice was pretty good as usual, I got the roasted chicken. Although,portion seems quite little and small for $4.

Its a must try....It is definitely the best place for steam chicken and rice. If you are in 2, better order half chicken so you will be satisfied. Price is reasonable compare to other restaurant.

This is an authentic local street place serving food, chicken rice and seems to be famous for it judging by the press cuttings. Food was ok and nice to eat with the locals

Good taste for the local chicken rice but the proportions are too small even we order chicken for 2. For the been is a little bit salty.

There are many “Hainan Chicken Rice” stalls in Singapore that claims to be of good-standard. This is an older established brandname and it has been years that we dropped by so good to refresh our taste buds again.No queue on a Sunday lunch when we dropped by and the area can easily seats more than 50. It is a normal old-setting eatery, no frills. Besides chicken here's also a range of other options if one does not fancy just the chicken rice. We did not try them, as we believed it should be good in its core, as the brand name suggest..In terms of pricing they are expensive, chicken for 2 pax cost $11 and that excludes the rice (each plate another $0.80). So technically it was not even a “set for 2”. The portion of meat is small see attached photo. The meat tasted ok while the (chicken) rice is not oily, yet lacking the usual oomph of most chicken-rice.. The chilli did add some good vibes though.Definitely not the value we are looking for.We have tasted better Hainanese Chicken Rice but not this experience

The chicken rice here is good. Tasty, and there's a range of other options if one doesn't want to have chicken rice. We ordered half a steamed chicken, a sambal kangkong (stir-fried vegetables in chilli), and the Thai glass chicken feet. All were good but we enjoyed the chicken the most. If I have to find a flaw, I would say the chicken is too soft. But many like softer chicken too so to each his own. Service is quite quick overall.

So far this is one of my favorite place to enjoy authentic Hainan rice served with Roasted Chicken in Singapore. The taste is so right and value for money.

Good food at a cheap price. Service is what you expect when you are sitting on plastic stools at tables.

鸡尾饭 (Chicken Tail Rice) was a major disappointmentThe chicken dish consists of mostly white chicken breast instead of thigh meat. I could have paid for regular chicken and get the same thing for less.Tables were dirty and i had to grab a tray of chilli/ginger sauce containers from another table on my own. Brusque service (slightly disorganized) in a restaurant run by mostly foreign staffs

Found this place by accident while looking for dinner. There was an auspicious queue so we thought it was good and we were not disappointed.The chicken was juicy and delectable, the rice savory. The accompanying dips were also very good.Never mind the plastic chairs and tables and sharing seats with fellow diners, just focus on the chicken :

We had to get some hainan chicken during our first visit to Singapore, and a friend who lives in Singapore took us there. The chicken literally melts in your mouth, and the overall food quality is excellent. It's a fun location if you're looking for cheap eats, and it's down the block from a great and popular bean curd place

Ok, so the service isn't Michelin star, but hey neither are the prices. My wife and I had chicken rice, Rendang squid, butter rice a coke and a large Tiger beer for less than $20 Singapore . Can't complain... The waitress went next door to grab my beer without a problem, her English may not be top notch but my "Chinese" is non existent so can't say anything. The place itself is no palace, but it's good value with no airs and graces. Can be busy and tables may not be spotless but food is authentic. Have eaten there on our last two trips to Singapore and will go back again

Pro: easy to reach, we saw the restaurant from opposite and cross the street to reach.Taste similar to us than other foodsCon: So so service, waitress seem not understand our English, all Chinese restaurant they are silent and iced facing all the time.Price not so chea

This place is occupying in an old colonial looking house. The place has no air-condition so expect to eat and sweat.We ordered both roasted chicken and steam chicken. I found the roasted chicken is slightly drier than the steam chicken. Both types have good taste but what make it more tasty are the condiments … black soya, chili sauce and ginger sauce. We also ordered veggie with garlic and oyster sauce … very tasty. Another dish was wonton soup … we found it very bland which was rather disappointed. But overall it was pretty good and yes very cheap in Singapore term!!

I ordered chicken rice. I have 2 options-steamed and brown chicken. The meal comes with 1 cup rice and soup. They have several seasonings to choose from. I chose chili with special sauce. It tasted better! It is affordable for 3.5 SGD per meal. The place though is not air-conditioned.

Location-wise it may not be at the best neighborhood but the food is as authentic as it can be.Ordered a whole chicken for a party of three and we were not disappointed. The rice was fluffy and flavorful, the chicken juicy and tasty.Be sure to expect for a long wait for a table especially during lunch and dinner.Will definitely be back
