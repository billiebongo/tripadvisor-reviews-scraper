The place itself is nice, the service is flawless, and the food was absolutely delicious (shared rillettes for starters, then beef cheek and duck leg for mains). All at a very reasonable price. We’re not even sure you would get the same price/quality ratio everywhere in France. This is very close to a 5/5, but the design of the tables makes it a little uncomfortable (very narrow), the wine selection is limited, and the decor is lacking a bit... will definitely be back though

The food it has to be said was of a very good standard, in terms of taste, quality and portions. The salmon was soft, with a subtle flavour and had a nice crispy skin. It was served on a bed of barley risotto which was tasty and light. The other dish we had was the chicken coq au vin, which was firstly huge and secondly very tasty. The red wine sauce was rich and flavourful without being overpowering. The dish came with a choice of mash or rustic bread. We chose the bread and it was nice and crusty on the outside and soft inside which helped to mop up the sauce. The other bonuses was the simple casual and smart decor, the polite and attentive service and the fact they served Asahi Black beer. The downside side of the experience was the table (as strange as it sounds) as the design of the legs meant they were narrow at the top of the table, which didn’t allow me to open my legs even a little during the entire meal. Oh the other downside was that they ran out of apple crumble so we had to save our waist line and leave. Overall we had a really nice meal at affordable price without any pretentious fancy French food vibes. Will definitely come back, but will maybe sit at the bar next time
