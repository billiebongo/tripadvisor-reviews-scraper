A simple lunch to start my day. Tried one of their sandwiches - roast beef and mushrooms with sweet relish, dijon mustard on sesame brioche bun.
5
I loved the breakfast here.. with coffee.. service is good.. and food is tasty.. I might go back again
3
Coffee and breakfast set is very affordable here. Causal place with not much ambience to speak about.
3
Tried the tea at the outlet in Somerset today. This consists simply of hot water and a tea bag. Not really worth the money. The coffee is much better and next time I'll stick to that.
4
The Joe & Dough I am trying to review is on the ground floor of The Orchard Centre near 160 Orchard Road. It is a popular small coffee shop and eatery. They have power points for laptops with friendly service and good food.
4
Had coffee and tried the lemongrass tea there last week. Coffee was good, robust but the lemongrass tea was bland. Not good value for money.
4
I have been there two days in a row now,a different Barista on duty both days but I still recieved well made coffee on both days. I even had a light breaky on visit two of the smoked salmon and avacoda on brioche bread. Very tasty after a hit of Tabasco sauce! There is comfortable seating and access to their wifi, so all in all a great spot for a snack and a good coffee.
4
I visited Joe & Dough at the National Stadium and was delighted to taste an exceptional cappuccino made from a variety of four coffee beans.The aroma and flavor resulting from the variety of coffee beans is now a Saturday requisite for me as as shop for my weekly groceries and household items at Stadium.A must try is the ham and egg breakfast toast which is an exceptional complement to the cappuccino and a perfect light and healthy breakfast. The waitstaff are very helpful and friendly and eager to assist you with your questions and selection

I was a little tired and look for a cup of coffee. Came across this place and saw signature coffee and ask for huge cup. to my surprise, I feel awake after a sip. Also it taste good without sugar. Hardly had coffee that taste good without sugar and would recommend if you are coffee love
4
Visited the outlet at Raffles Place after lunch today for a quick coffee. Somehow the coffee here seemed stronger and better than my one last week at the outlet in Millennia Walk: not sure why. Efficient service, but not easy to get a table.
4
After lunch, we fancy some coffee and thought we will try this place. Not disappointed at all, their coffee was really good as well as their cake. However, i find it slightly pricey.

Hard to find using Google maps - map just takes you to wrong section of mall
Mainly just cabinet food and coffee
Couldn't find any vegetarian food I liked (not many options)
5
If, like me, you're visiting on business you like to eat as much local cuisine as you can. But sometimes, you just fancy a sandwich!Perhaps it was because it wasn't rice. Perhaps because it was tasty without being spicy. I don't know but the veg sandwich was - excellent. I'll go again next time. Just the once, but I will go!
4
Had a coffee stop here, a piccolo latte and cake. Coffee is probably one of the best in town, definitely perks you up. The cake surprisingly was nice. Had a Yuzu Surprise, nice refreshing taste of Yuzu. And Expresso Chocolate Cheesecake...another surprise not to much cheese or chocolate a good balance.

We went to Joe & Dough at Leisure Park while waiting for bowling. Want to try something different than Coffee Bean or Star Buck. Very good coffee and cozy place to hang out. We also tried the carrot cake which tastes nice too. Will come back in futur

I visited Joe & Dough at 10 Sinaran Drive #01-156 Square 2 Singapore while visiting my nephew and his wife who live in Singapore. My nephew knows I enjoy good coffee and so he took the trouble of recommending this place. I was impressed - the coffee was well made, rich in flavour and left a pleasant after-taste. I could smell the coffee as we entered the premises. We sat on a low lounge which had seen better days. However, the coffee was very good

I visited your new location at International Plaza (10 Anson Road #01-33 - I can't find it on Trip Advisor) and ordered a Teriaki Chicken sandwich, not really knowing how it would have tasted. At the first bite I realize it has not been a good choice, as it didn't match my European taste. Nothing wrong with the sandwich, just my mistake. I left the sandwich in the plate, quite sad, and started checking Facebook on my phone as I had to wait for a while for an appointment. A lady that works here (I think her name is "Vivian") came to check on me asking what was wrong with the sandwich. I explained that it I simply did not like it, and she offered to change it. I opted for a chicken tikka that end up to be delicious! This simple nice and kind gesture (I could see she really meant to care for me, as client) has assured you (the company) a lot of good publicity as I will suggest your restaurant to all those I will happen to talk about it. You also have a new loyal client (I ordered also coffee and dessert that was not in my initial intention, and they are great), plus I'll make sure to visit back each time I am in this area! I wish I could witness more of this kindness in Singapore. Thank you for really taking care of your clients

I went to the outlet at Novena (Square 2). I was there at the medical centre nearby and was looking for a decent coffee. Certainly I found a good cafe I thought after stumping upon the famous SIMONELLI brewing machine. The coffee most definitely did not disappoint. The side order was Truffle Egg Mayo, looks fancy and nice I thought. For a price of $8.50++ i guess it is a rip off, the artist impression on bill board and actual food served is a difference of sky and earth. I could not taste any tinge of truffle and the picture shown significant sprinkle of fish roe on top of the egg but the amount came is quite sad. What disappoint me the most was the bread itself, was toasted to perfection but I could not enjoy the bread as it was over the top chewy. The chewy is similar to a bad cheap steak. I really got no idea, was that a one off or the standard of their bread is such. But could not deny it will be a good place to have a coffee and escape away from work for office folks around that area

“There is nothing complicated. Just real quality food made by people who care.” I must say I somehow liked the above tagline on the serviette: forthright, yet somewhat brash! My two friends and I re-visited Joe and Dough@Millenia Walk on 27 Feb 2016, after a 2-month break. We ordered hot coffee and cheese cake (our usual favourites there): the former was strongly aromatic and thick in flavour; while the latter was smooth, creamy and cheesy, and not overly-sweet (the coffee-cake set@$9.50).We were inwardly glad that the usual noisy crowd was visibly absent, although we also noticed there was a steady stream of walk-in customers in the shop, keeping the staff somewhat engaged and busy.The arrival of the coffee at our table created considerable excitement in us: the new “monkey” face (so very apt; 2016 being the Chinese Year of the Monkey) together with the ever-popular fern-leaf design were truly delightful and awesome: both were truly creative and artistic. Impressed by the creations; we spent the few early minutes snapping the patterns using our ever-ready smart-phones, brimming with the excitement of innocent young children in a toy-shop!Oh, the little things in life which make one happy: so fun, lah

Good drinks selection. Good sandwich selection. Pricey though. Not much you can find in Singapore. But staff are friendly.
2
Despite the sign saying they would make any sandwich on their menu they glibly told me it was unavailable. As an all day cafe it sadly failed.
4
I always find it difficult to find a half decent cappacino when in downtown Singapore.However this place is OK. ThereIt is A

I ordered a sandwich and a pizza.
pros: quality, freshness, service
cons: beverages are just ok, variety in the menu

After deciding we have had enough Christmas-Day leisurely window-shopping at Millenia Walk, my two friends and I automatically and naturally gravitated to the ‘Joe and Dough’ outlet on the ground level, just as we had frequently done so in the past.It was easy choice for us as we opted for two Gourmet Cake Sets (nett $9.50 each) supplemented by an additional coffee. The Blueberry-Yoghurt and Expresso-Cheese cakes were truly delicious (silky-textured and yummy) and the hot Latte drinks were velvety-smooth with a tinge of thickness and very, very aromatic (even though we always had hesitated to stir away the floral patterns). The total bill for three of us - $24; nicely-priced, we thought. We were comfortable and relaxed as we thoroughly savoured and enjoyed the coffee and cakes (see photographs). The youthful staff were an amiable lot indeed; and generally were readily approachable anytime for friendly advice or recommendation on the food and drinks available, including what’s new on the menu or what’s popular with customers.Admittedly, the outlet could do better with a bigger space and layout, given that oftentimes, potential customers would likely be discouraged by the packed capacity or the apparent lack of available seating (some hidden inwards), especially, those without the time or patience to wait to be seated properly by staff. Also, some patrons might be rather boisterous and talkative among themselves in the confined space. Nevertheless, some noise could help enhance the liveliness of the premises.Generally, a good place to relax and have a short break - try it yourself one day

Visited joe & dough at kallang leisure park. This is the only joe & dough I visit & hv been back 3 times with different friends. We love the latte here & the friendly staff. Do try the gula Melaka pandan cake. Ask the staff to warm it up. It's the best I hv tried. Soft, yummy & not too sweet. One friend 'complained' the next day tt he cldnt work bec the thought of the cake was swimming around his head :

We usually visit the outlet at Square 2 (Novena). For 4 of us, most of the time you can find a place to sit with decent settee and coffee table. There's a big round table that sits about 6 pax but this is not so popular because of the tall stools and table. It's mostly small tables sprawled across the main area that sits 2 pax.If you have a group of more than 2 pax and visiting the Orchard Gateway outlet, be prepared to wait a very long time for tables because the crowd here seems to enjoy melting down and the same people stay for a very long time. There's a platform that has 2 picnic tables (sits 4 pax per table) but sadly it's usually with single occupants staring at his/her laptop oblivious to the people looking for seats during peak hours. I do hope the management can look into facilitating seats so they don't turn away customers who have just arrived and also not lose potential revenue.Chicken tikka sandwich is my husband's favourite. It's fresh. Their pastries are comparable to Starbucks' but the guala melaka sponge is a tat sweet. They make good lattes and I love the lemongrass detox tea. Lemongrass detox teabags are on sale but they are $22 for a box (pricey). If you are a frequent customer, ask for their loyalty card where they give you a stamp for every beverage purchased for some redemption

I was at Golden shoe Building and walked past this bakery at the end of the day. I walked in and saw some cakes in the glass counter.There were some cakes available and I ordered the following:- Earl Grey Roll: $6.20. The cake roll was a normal roll and the cream was earl grey infused. Its topped with a mini apple. Taste-wise, its alright only. - Blueberry Yoghurt: $6.50 This looked good. It’s a triangular slice from a whole pie. It has a cookie crust, with a soft yoghurt white portion topped with blueberries. This was the first dessert to be finished when I brought it home. Not bad.- Carrot Cake: $6. The best of the lot. The carrot cake is layered over each other with cream cheese in between. Good aroma and flavour. Love this. Some hits and a miss. Will try their bread items next time

Popped into here for a quick bite, at about 3pm, my husband ordered an Egg Mayo sandwich, which was on their menu. Guess what they couldn't make it, which was surprising as on the counter was a sign saying. 'Don't see your favourite sandwich we'll make it'. They should add just not when you want it. Staff brash and coffee sour. Also expensive. Give this place a miss
3
We find the food there rather pricey. 4sgd for a large looking croissant with just a slice of cheese and ham...Coffee is alright there. I didn't like the taste of the coffee as I find the beans too sour.Maybe majority of the people in Singapore prefer their coffee sour but not me.Staff are okay. sitting arrangment also okay if you are find with small round table

I like the ambience at Golden Shoe branch in Central Business District - not too crowded; not too empty. Good for business discussions or short meetings especially with a freshly brewed mocha or capuccino! Friendly staff and delicious sandwiches which are warmed when you order
4
I visited the one at Sentosa... Staff was very courteous.... Upon my request, They suggested me to have Monbana chocolate... Let me tell you, it was wonderful...
5
Had a delicious coffee, but couldn't eat a thing. Nothing for coeliacs here. Great service. nice soft chairs..
4
Came here for Cappuccino! Excellent brew ... enjoyed it a lot! Service was good. The seating capacity in Novena was small but nice simple deco
5
Chill place with nice sandwiches. Service with a smile. $8-10 per sandwich, but you probably wouldn't be full with just one, unfortunately. Loved the Bacon and Mushroom Melt.
4
There are no listings of Joe and Dough Novena and Orchard Central on TA but here goes.I love chilling at this place. It's quiet and comfy. The staff try their best to be friendly.Try the peanut butter chocolate frost which comes with a thick, smooth and sweet taste. We also particularly like the peanut butter stack and blueberry tart

It's just typically coffees & bakery shop. The coffee was OK as same as sandwich. The round table is not steady enough for more than few dishes and drinks. Also the round chairs gave me the same feeling. Not very comfortable to sit in. There's no service, I paid at the cashier and then walked to pickup my order at the same place.

I work at Novena and its very refreshing to have some good espresso coffee around the area. Its very important to realize that having an espresso is different from having coffee shop coffee. I have had a few good orders at Joe and Dough before, but my last experience with them just closed the door for me. I like my coffee strong, and I requested my expresso to be over some hot water and then a dash of milk on top. The barista was a different chap this time and was very quiet. And when he had finished, he handed me the cup of coffee with a carton of milk to pour my own milk without uttering a word. What attitude. Very unprofessional and rude. I will never come back. Good riddance

I know that Joe & Dough (serving good and honest handcrafted coffee) has been around for a while, but I never got around to visiting it till today. Acclaimed to serve good coffee (even *Damien held praises for it!) and delectable pastries by hands of dedicated bakers - with no shortcuts, no preservatives and no mass producing - well , we shall see about that hmmm...Nestled along the long aisle at Orchard Central / Orchard Gateway, this open-concept cafe is a cross between rustic and hipster, yet retains a class of its own.The Blueberry Yogurt Tart (SGD$6.50) was a real treat and a palate cacophony of divine textures orchestrated into one - smooth yogurt center that was soft like tofu but creamy as dream, juicy fresh blueberries to balance the sweetness of the crust, and crunchy crust made of ...digestives biscuits (strong flavor), making this dessert almost a sinless choice.Next, we gave the Strawberry Custard Tart (SGD$5.00) a shot - because it looked so pretty. Well, the base was a little hard, as were the frozen flowers of chocolate sauce and custard. We loved the flavor of this concoction though, and the dark chocolate eaten with juicy strawberries was an absolute delight.Finally, we tried the Coconut Tart (SGD$3.90) just for fun - it was inexpensive, and it sounded interesting enough. We just didn't expect to be swooned by this deceptively simple-looking pastry.The crust was crispy - granted, and there was a very light coating of brown sugar toasted to crunchiness on it. The inside was fluffy, and filled with real grated coconut flesh - it was ohmygod delicious, the exotic sweetness of coconut combined with the crunchy feel when one chewed on the grated coconut bits.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/09/tea-break-at-joe-dough-cafe-orchard.htm
