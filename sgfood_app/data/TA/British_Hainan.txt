Love the old style deco. The food is good and served in very big portion! The minus point is that he place is a little noisy. We have to shout when we make conversation. Overall itâ€™s a choice for family gathering.

Had a wonderful lunch with family at British Hainan.
The beef noodle reminds me of the taste from old which sadly is not found anymore.
Definitely be back for more

This is certainly a very different restaurant to visit and may not be to everyones taste.The menu is very limited(check on line before you go) however the food is good.Its a very wacky place with very old style deco. The owners make you feel very welcome and are happy to chat to you. You may get seronaded by Fred the owner but its all good fun. The restaurant is a bit off the beaten track and would need a taxi if staying in town

Well worth a visit, then you'll want to go again! The atmosphere created by Fred and his wife is immediately welcoming, as if you are a friend visiting their home. And what a home... Crammed full of memorabilia, whether local or Western, an eclectic mix of old pictures, musical instruments and fascinating ephemera, a lifetime of memories. And then food to create a lifetime memory, too. Our party of three had the oxtail stew, the lamb and the fish of the day, while we argued about who had the best meal. Truth is, they were all fantastic. Great food, a wonderful atmosphere, reasonable prices - like us, you'll want to go again

Tucked away in an inconspicuous lane called Carpmael Road, this unique casual diner serves the best oxtail stew! I had also babyback ribs while my daughter enjoyed their fish serving. This place takes you back to memory lane as the owner keeps an eclectic collection of old memoribilia...from the trusty hand-won gramaphone, accorfian, grandfather clocks and even a lovely Vespa. The boss Frederick is friendly and we could tell he is so full of passion for his special diner. Highly recommended

Excellent ox tail stew and chicken chop. Oxtail stewed to perfection and melts in your mouth. Sauce and chicken chop were also very tasty.Eclectic place with alot of old memorabilia. Cool aircon inside and outdoor dining in the evening is an option. Related food outlet is the well know and loved "gu bak kway teow" which was also very good

It's not all about food here. It's about the British and Hainan heritage. Plenty of antiques available for sale and loan too. Anything you see is available for sale if you'd like to. Restaurant only have a few table. So please make your reservations. Ambience 7/10Food wise I've ordered the rosemary chicken drumstick. Taste delicious as expected, but nothing too fantastic. Wedges were not crispy. Had spicy chicken wings and also sausage platter. Taste alright. My friend had pork chop and found it tough. Food: 6/10 (definitely above average, but nothing to shout about)Price: approximately 15 to 30 bucks per main course. Reasonable. Service is good. Nothing too professional. Just personal, homely and casual - I like it this way too. Fred spoke hainanese and it's comforting to hear the authentic version of it. Fred was kind enough to offer us free mango pudding for each of us at the end of the meal. Nice gesture. Service: 8/1

The casual atmosphere, replete with wall to wall 50s-70s nostalgic bric-a-brac and the easy Sunday 'comfort' food all added up to a wonderful Sunday evening wind-down for our alumni of ex colleagues catch up.British Hainan served reasonably priced oxtail soup and pork chop (that's what our group of ten ordered). My eyes spied a diner at the next table having a clam pasta so I reckoned there were more than just these two traditional dishes on their menu).We were satisfied with our orders which were accompanied by European ales and BYO bottles of red wines. The portions were generous and didn't leave much room for dessert (we had truffle oil fries with our pre dinner drinks, and were served a cup of mango pudding on the house ).Service was a bit slow especially at the beginning but friendly. The proprietor came by our table a couple of times.

We ordered oxtail stew, hainanese pork chop, lamb shank and grilled chicken. Food was not too bad but i would say otherwise for service. I had a lemongrass drink and spotted a tiny fly in it towards end of my drink. Told the waitress about it... she gave me some excuse that it was something from the lemongrass... told her to look carefully... she took my drink and never came back even there is still one quarter of it...Fren wanted to order grilled chicken... lady boss trying to dissuade her telling her the dish has some waiting time of 15mins and recommended lamb to her... keep insisting on promoting the lamb even tho fren said she is willing to wait..

We decided to check out this restaurant upon seeing the review on TA. It was like visiting a friend's house. The place was filled with the owner's collection of antiques which were also for sale unless otherwise stated. It was very popular with families with seniors and children. We ordered the signature oxtail stew, hainanese pork chop, onion soup and bacon with portobello mushroom. The oxtail was very tender and the gravy very tasty. Loved the food. It really tasted like home cooked food and very satisfying indeed. There was a free serving of mango pudding. Spent $62 for food and lemongrass drinks. The owners were very friendly and chatty. This place has been around for a while but we only just discovered it, we will be back to try the other dishes.

Friendly and nice ambience. Food is great as well. Will definitely come to this place and try other food again :)

Fred and Jessie are the best host ever. Like dining in a friend's home. They have extended their drinks menu and now offer a wide selection of alcoholic drinks. Food is always so yummy. Love it!

Average with misses, the pork chop and fries were soggy, oxtail was average with some tough bits, spaghetti was a tad too ketchupy and sweet...overall similar to a western stall at a hawker center but with steep prices...deco was quaint and nostalgic, worth browsing around

My local friend and his family recommended the British Hainan restaurant for a family meal tonight (23/3)This is not a typical Singaporean restaurant - it has a touch of an antique shop...eccentric to a degree....serving up western dishes with a difference - the proprietors have a background from Hainan island in China. Very positive and helpful, introducing other customers to us - we also shared experiences in China and Australia.Our group ordered a variety of dishes: oxtail stew, chicken with rosemary, roast chicken, pork cutlets and sambal chicken wings - dishes were accompanied with chips, salad or vegetables.My friend and I had two German beers and we all finished with an ice cream.Not bad at all - recommended if you are in the area - it was lots of fun

We accidentally passed this restaurant, which looks attractive and original from the outside with nice terrace with fans and lots of decorations. Extremely friendly and attentive owners who made us feel very welcome. Lamb was really tasty and kids loved fish and chips. Pork chop was average. Cold German beers tasted very well. Highly recommended if you want to go off-the-beaten track and are in for British food.

Extremely friendly & welcoming. Ambience cosy with loads of knick knacks. Fred & Jessie helm a husband wife team serving signature oxtail, bangers & mash, pork chops. You can feel the love & pride in all that they do. Service is above all warm & excellent. The greeting is "Welcome home". Feels like it too

2nd time for dining here. Except 'dining' doesn't convey the experience at all. We were a party of 11 and it really was more like being invited to dinner by a slightly eccentric but well traveled friend.'Mein Host' really acted like Master of Ceremonies and was just like a member of the party - regailing us with stories, emphasizing his British and Hainan roots.There was one other party of 9 in the restaurant and we were encouraged to intermingle - partly by the hosts insistence on each table entertaining the other courtesy of the karaoke facility. Now that might sound tacky but it was honestly a very positive experience!Food was great. Menu and wine list not extensive but quality and value unquestioned (750 SGD for 11 - half of whom took full advantage of the wine list)Certainly a place to visit - for the experience as much as the food. It reminded me a bit like a cross between "the good old days" with Leonard Sachs (on BBC in the 80s) and Steptoe and Son (the restaurant is full of antiques/bric a brac).Unique is the best way to describe it..

Celebrated my mother in law's 82nd birthday dinner here with 3 teens & 4 adults. Cosy place (3-year old restaurant) with awesome delicious food & interesting vintage curios for purchase. Indoor seats 36 pax comfortably. Owner Frederick is super friendly & even played the accordion & sang birthday song. Must try signature oxtail stew which is stewed for 6 hours & sat marinated for 4 hours prior, total 10 hours prep to give a super tender meat with aromatic flavor. Also had mouth watering baby back ribs. Starters must try are the truffle fries, Sambal wings & bacon cheese in portobello mushroom. Many return customers which now includes me. Good value for money. Parking may be a challenge but only a 50m walk from HDB public carpark.

Had the Lamb Shank and truly enjoyed it, even using the bread supplied for soaking up the gravy. Cooked for 4 hours plus, the meat falls off the bone and it was a welcome change of pace. Would gladly good back when I am in Singapore

It wasn't so long ago when nearly all Western food restaurants in Singapore were run by Chinese people of Hainanese origin. This was because many of the early Hainanese immigrants found work in restaurants, hotels, and clubs owned by the British colonialists. These included the iconic Raffles Hotel, the Singapore Cricket Club and even the Singapore Swimming Club. Many Hainanese also became sailors and some of these became cooks for Western liners like the E&O.The more enterprising of these early immigrants adapted the recipes they learned and started their own restaurants. And so, whenever we ate at locally prepared Western food, we were almost certain to be eating something prepared and adapted by Hainanese people.Because of changing tastes and consumers' quest for more 'authentic' Western food, and the refusal of the children of many chefs to take over their parents' businesses, Hainanese dominance of that trade and their adaptations of Western recipes faded over the years.Enter Uncle Fred and his quest to revive iconic recipes of that time. These include oxtail stew, Hainanese pork chop, and their version of fish and chips. To emphasise the retro nature of his menu, he has liberally placed artefacts from days of yore at his restaurant.For those who grew up with these dishes, biting into a serving is likely to bring back family lunches of long ago. For those new to the dishes, it's a good chance to see how Western food has / had been adapted to meet local tastes.And even if you weren't keen on the food (not likely), there's always the artefacts to amuse and the owner, Uncle Fred, to charm you

I brought my mother and brother to this restaurant. He even let my mum sang 2 or 3 songs on his karaoke set! ;)

This place is a real find..... full of fantastic antique furniture and historical curiosities, it is quite a experience to dine here.
What's more the food is great too! Tasty, fresh, home-cooked style that blends British and Hainanese traditional dishes. A must try!

This place is a gem! Good intimate service, lovely food, nice cozy ambience. We love it! And the music is super! Not many places play vinyl records nowadays. Super nice!!!!

An hidden germ! Located in a residential area this is a great place for western food at good prices. You can eat on the terrace on a quiet street. This is kind of a museum restaurant with a lot of old objects displayed.
Highly recomnended

This is not an easy restaurant to stumble upon. It's buried in the back streets of Joo Chiat and when you chance upon it, the outside and inside are cluttered with a jumble of stuff. Photos, cameras, musical equipment, knock knacks. It's kinda cool to look at this collection. It's not fine dining and the menu has a few family hand me down generational recipes - oxtail stew and lamb shanks.. The food is not bad- it's the experience that makes this place a nice change from the norm. It's family run, and they all make an appearance in the dining room to welcome you and chat. They play music from an old gramophone upon request. It's packed with regulars who come for the familiarity.. If you are looking for a reasonable home cooked meal and a night away from the same old same old, take a peak...

We found this restaurant scouring the web for a restaurant close to the hotel where we spent our stopover night in Singapore. It is situated in a residential part of Singapore, and you can even see some very nice old buildings in the nearby streets. The owner spotted us casting a glance into the restaurant from outside, opened the door and gave us a warm welcome! British Hainan seems to be a mix of living room, museum, shop and tavern - we didn't even want to sit down as there were so many things to see all around. The owner furnished this place with a private collection of the weirdest things - nutcrackers, old telephones and even an antique gramophone that still works. While we were reading the menu, he came to our table, asked us where were coming from and answered all our questions. He was always around, chatted with the guests, showed us the funniest items of his collection and obviously enjoyed every minute of being in good company. It was like spending an evening at a friend's place! As British food is not our favourite cuisine and the menu card looked quite simple, we did not expect the dinner to be delicious - but it was. We took the Poletto mushroom as a starter and it was so tasty! The same applied to the Fish&Chips and the Grilled chicken with a wonderful homemade sauce...The evening went by...but when the restaurant had already closed, we were still at our table having very interesting conversations with the owner. He even opened the door again for some other people just to say hello and let them have a look at his place. They came from a nearby wedding party and brought bride and groom, so he played some music for them. (Finally, me and my partner ended up at the wedding party.) We highly recommended this place to everyone who wants more than just a dinner and enjoys restaurants with a warm, private and special touch

This air con cozy restaurant is interesting with many retro exhibits. The oxtail soup and baby ribs are good. Also tried the Hainanese pork chop which is nice too. Would try other dishes in my next visit.For those who drive, it would be easier to park near Blk 3 Haig Rd and take a 5min walk

A group of 12 celebrating birthday so we almost took up most of the space inside this cosy restaurant. Great hospitality from the owner and staff. Good food. But felt sorry for the other customers who must have felt the place was too noisy when there was a big group. Lamb shanks and pork chops were delicious. The mango jelly at the end of the meal was served in retro glasses and amusing.

The dÃƒÂ©cor brings out the nostalgia, and reminds me of the time long ago of the things I'd see in my grandmother's and mother's old place. It's really beautiful. The service is friendly, quick and attentive, but mostly homely and friendly, feels personal. :D I had the oxtail stew which was ok, but my sister's grilled chicken was very tasty. Wish I'd ordered that instead. It was late when we finished, we had some pudding for desert on the house - absolutely deliciously smooth. I would love come again for another visit, and this time, I'll order the grilled chicken

You are greeted by its owner Welcome Home! A special moving emotional greeting hailing you home for a good Hainanese fare. Needless to say the infamous pork cutlet is spectacular crispy to its bite, juicy soft pork loin with its tomato based sauce, a succulent combination that you don't want to miss.It's flavorful oxtail stew a delight to carnivorous connoisseur who love to pair it with red wine or dark beer.Their lamb shank is not a disappointment too as you don't get the strong lamb smell that some detest. For first timers complimentary ice cream is on the house but I luv mine served very cold before it melts not at one go when the rest are done with their meals.If ever you hunger for good Hainanese British fare you will not be disappointed as its owner's dad served the British as a chef
