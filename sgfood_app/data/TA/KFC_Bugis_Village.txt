This place is located near Bugis MRT, walking distance from Raffles Hospital. It's quite busy area. Good service. Quick as well. Love the Fried chicken as well as cheese fried is my favorite. Check out the photos.

I am a chicken lover & love to visit KFC wherever I go. KFC in Singapore is also good & price is reasonable. However, they should focus more on cleanliness of their premises.

Just had dinner at this place, took two bites of a chicken piece and saw this. Which looks extremely raw.

One of the pioneers of fast food in Singapore. Whenever I have craving for fried chicken. KFC will always come to my mind. The chickens are specially prepared with their own secret recipe. Always taste good. Must try when you ever have any craving !!!

It happened at Fareast kfc Not bugis vilage to be fair .Sorry as i cant find the branch at fareast so i wrote here instead .The indian guy Cashier wasnt very polite actually he talk quite loudly to me and never greet me or say thank you.Then when i ask to change the Coke to large he changed to black face and say no large in kfc so i say thanks but he never say thanks back, and before i could pack my wallet and take the food he shouted " Next" as if i was suppose to be fast and give way to the next customer but it was only a few seconds and i didnt gave enough time but it was quite bad of him .Anyway i went to wash hands and someone knocked my new bag very hard with the mop...it was the Cleaner .he didnt even have the basic courtesy to say " excuse me" No service really bad

I'm not a fan of KFC at home but its hard to please everyone in the family and KFC seems to have something for everyone. The Roaster burger isn't too bad and the chips are ok. However, I found the service at Bugis Street exceptional. There was an older lady serving and she was absolutely fantastic - she went through the menu and explained what we could get and what would be cheaper etc in a meal deal. You just don't get this kind of service in Australian fast food chains! Loved her to pieces

after a tiring day of shopping thru' bugis, with the humidity being high, we entered KFC and had some chilled coke and chicken. the AC felt heavenly since we were melting in the heat. the seating was all indoors but spread out well, so, at no point did it seem crammed up.their beef burger was also really nice - something we r deprived of in India :P Enjoyed it.
