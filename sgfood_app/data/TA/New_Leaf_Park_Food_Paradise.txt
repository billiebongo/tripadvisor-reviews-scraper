I don't know what more to say other than this is by far the best Mee Pok aka Bak Chor Mee on the planet and is second to none.Every time that I'm back in Singapore, if even only for a single week, I'll go back to this place two or three times.The noodles are al dente and the broth so subtle and refined but what makes the dish sublime is the chilli sambal sauce that brings it all together in perfect balance.This is a must eat whilst in Singapore and I can't wait until I'm there next.Cheers!Dave
