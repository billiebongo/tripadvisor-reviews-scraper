Another hidden gem in the Farrer Park area. Great yakitori like short rib, chicken skin and pork belly. My personal favorite though is the prawn with uni sauce. Totally awesome flavor explosion!

Very good Japanese food. Izakaya type.
All the dishes have a twist of something that make it unique.
Good value for money too. Good service. A place to go and come back to.

The place was located just above the MRT station. For a Sunday afternoon, the place was pretty empty except for a couple of customers. Looking at the limited menu, there was lunch set menu even for Sunday which was quite rare these days.Ebi Ten Donburi 海老天丼 (S$16++)shrimp tempura on rice, appetizer, pickle, soup, dessert The appetizer was cold potato salad which smelt hints of truffle oil. It tasted not bad.The soup was pipping hot miso soup with wakame and wild mushrooms in it. For the main, there was 4 tempura prawns and a tempura mushroom over the pipping hot rice, with sauce all over. Due to the sauce, there was lack of crispiness in the tempura, although the prawns tasted quite fresh.Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was quite icy. The meal was accompanied with hot ocha which was refillable.Not bad but also not outstanding

We stayed at One Farrer Hotel & Spa and this izakaya is located within the Owen link that connects to the hotel so we decided to give this place a try. The food is really delicious and service was good. Environment is great too. Would really recommend this place for people who stay at One Farrer Hotel and doesn't want to go out too far for a meal. This is the place to go to! Prices are a little steep for me but worth a try :)

We dined at JINzakaya for dinner. The first impression was great, as the place looked really impressive, with a very Japanese vibe. Initially looking at the menu, we thought, wow, it's cheap. Once our food arrived, we realized why. The prices were reflective of portion sizes. We tried tori momo (chicken thigh), shiitake, and shishito (Japanese green pepper) Kushi (skewers), and each had 2-4 pieces. The skewers are slightly on the saltier side, that leaves a nice after-taste in your mouth. We loved each of the skewers. Next, we tried 3 types of Donburi (rice bowl): Tori Teriyaki Donburi (chicken), Sake Donburi (salmon), and Garlic Yakimeshi (fried rice). Each portions barely fill stomach of one, and leave you wanting for more. Nevertheless, we liked all the items as they were quite delicious. Our particular favorite was the Chicken Donburi.The restaurant also provided complimentary pear pudding to each of us at the end, which was a pleasant surprise. It was a sweet dessert, unfortunately we didn't enjoy the food as much as we did the gesture

I've been here only twice, but this place has never disappointed me yet. This is rather quiet a pace to dine in on a weekday, but best to make reservations, you'll never know. Prices of the skewers are affordable. The taste, is not overly seasoned, or overwhelming. There are many other dishes that yet to try, but to say what made me not really happy in flavour is the gyu-tan, slightly overcooked to a near rubbery texture. Other than that, my next disappointment is that twice I've been here, twice I was unable to order the matcha ice cream tempura. The service crew here are attentive to just about everything, so asking them for their recommendation cannot go wrong as well. Though what really makes the services even better, is the extra lull ittle things that they do, like refilling your cup without asking, and most importantly is how they know when we've finished eating. One of the crew will come up to your table and ask your friends and you if you should like have complimentary desserts. These desserts are not from the menu so far and I like them mostly. Other than that, this pace really deserve a review and a return visit. Don't miss out on this great place

Food is reasonably priced and good, but the restaurant is understaffed during lunch hours, especially the kitchen, as they were unable to attend to customers efficiently. It was very warm too when seated beside the kitchen. The music was so unsuitable for the ambience. I had the lunch set menu, cold ramen. The salad was generous, the ramen was delicious because it was served cold as promised and the teriyaki chicken was tender and tasty, and the ice cream is terrific!Because of the food and price, i will definitely consider having a meal there the next time i'm in the area

This is a great Ramen and sake concept. I have been here for lunch and dinners. Staff are very friendly and the selection is amazing. Its reminiscent of the hole in the wall eateries in Japan for City workers before heading home. The wagyu beef and ramen selection is consistently good. There are daily specials and 3 choices of Bento boxes. The Sake selection is also wonderful for a small eatery and goes down well in the evenings after work. Not open for breakfast or brunch
