Reserved a table for my parents for their wedding anniversary. They enjoyed the food and the complimentary tiramisu from the generous kitchen staff for their anniversary.

Food was great! they were accommodating to our diet and willing to make some changes to the food according to our needs. Staff could have been a little bit more friendlier but overall, it was a great dining experience.. :)

My colleague and I were seated and told of the range of special dishes on offer. We chose to have the lunch specials. My colleague's pasta was certainly not Italian: carrot soup followed bybreaded deep-fried dory fish sitting on top of a tomato based pasta. Mine was salad followed by a lamb bolognese. But despite the rather eclectic array, both dishes tasted nice. Price-wise, rather steep, given that the was no dessert and only a strange fruit-flavored tea. Service was good with 2 personable waiters.

Our team of 22 were there for our year end dinner. the owner tried his best to accommodate to us. the servers are all new. Not much experience. food was good though. serving portion reasonably good. I thought more efforts can be make to the setting up of the restaurant. current set up looks very 'food court" style.. dun give patronage a nice feel

Fiirst experience is good food value for money but this time is disappointing. The lunch promo has changed. it is not as value for money as before (previously ard $14 for full set 3 course lunch, now can cost ard $19. Choices for lunch promo also limited now, presetnation on menu is not that clear. As usual, waiting time is long and lengthy, service is slow. I had the 1 minute steak with rosotto, just average for taste. Not a place to recommend if u only have an hour for lunch

Other den it's halal there's nothing else good about the restaurant. Service is no good - the waiter keep getting the wrong order despite it was an empty cafe. There were barely only 1 other table dining.The food was not nice and it's very expensive.

Love the friendly and accommodating service, nice family ambience of restaurant. We arrived early for lunch and opted for their good value lunch menu. We have the risotto and pizza. Added on the soup and salad of the day and cold cut of Parma lamb and burrata cheese. The mushroom soup of the day was the highlight, not too creamy. All dishes comes with a generous helping of rocket leaves. The rest of the dissed needs more work

This place is special not only because of the food but also the atmosphere. The waitress & chef are friendly. The food is good. There're unique dishes like truffles mash potatoes & fermented desserts. Yummy! Never tried these elsewhere. Should visit this restaurant if around the area
