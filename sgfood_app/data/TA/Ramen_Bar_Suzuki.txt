Managed to exchange for a free bowl of ramen during this visit, ramen still consistently good, there are still free sides as well.

5th time here, ramen still consistently good, with good broth. They offer a selection of ramen to choose from, with add-ons. Cash only.

3rd time here, and only then did i realise that the establishment provides free potato salad and hard boiled eggs as sides for patrons who want them. The ramen here is pretty good, guess the only downside here is still the cash only rule.

Good ramen fix, long queue, downside is also that they only accept cash payments. Sets are decently priced as well.

It's hard to find, but well worth the effort. If you like ramen, then this is the place. Every possible combination of ramen imaginable and you decide how you want it. Highly recommended.

I had a great time here, the food was fast and good, and filling. The broth is really nice too. Pretty simple fare but really delicious.

A great no-fuss ramen bar that provides free sides! Steamed rice, potato salad and bean sprouts are free and all you can eat. Ramen broth was flavoursome without being overwhelming. Noodles were cooked well without being soggy or too firm. The spice level was great in the cardinal red tonkatsu ramen but curry ramen was a tad too sweet.

I loved their stocks! I usually go at 11.35 just before lunch crowds. Always long queue. About $14-15 per bowl. Not cheap if you are just looking for casual lunch around this area. But very worth it because there is free flow of eggs, potato salad , bean sprouts , rice and ice tea. Loved the shrimp soup base. Very prawny. Abit salty but very rich stock and flavourful. Always feel so satisfied after every visit.

Ordered the Cardinal Red, but it was not as spicy as expected; Too mild. The soup was okay but could be better. The shoulder loin was soft and nice, paired along with the free flow sides such as the mashed potato with pork (?) inside and spicy bean sprouts. A bit pricey

I arrived at this place on a typical Singapore afternoon for lunch.Since this ramen place is very popular, I understand that they need to make sure all guests of a group are present before they seat you, and you're anyway supposed to stand in line at the cashier just outside the shop, to place your order before you're shown inside.It's just that, given how hot the weather can get, I expected the inside of the place to provide a little reprieve from the heat, y'know? But even with all the fans and the apparent air conditioners in sight, my friends and I found ourselves sweating throughout our stay there. Of course, consuming hot soupy ramen does not help.I think Suzuki seriously need to bring in better air conditioners which actually make a difference.That said, the ramen was really good. The Pure White Ramen which I had was so tasty, and what struck me was that the broth was delicious, yet not heavy. It wasn't too oily either.Strangely, the same cannot be said for their gyoza, which came coated in a layer of sesame oil. While the sesame oil made the gyoza very fragrant, every bite also felt very oily and a little turn-offish. At least, when you bite into it, the inside is still juicy.I liked the free flow of hard boiled eggs, bean sprouts and potato salad which they provide. At the moment I think that's only for lunch, but the potato salad was anyway really tasty.I certainly recommend this ramen place for ramen lovers; however just be prepared to sweat it out while you're in there
