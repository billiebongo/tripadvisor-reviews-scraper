Thank you very much for the unique experience.
The Green Monster Lager looks good.
Then, I just started by for that.
Yes, it looks good and it tastes natural as usual.
Interesting experience it was.
Thank you very much

Very nice view near by the river. And good beer (specially the green beer).very good server, (Nishant) smiley face

Loads of choice in the area but took a punt on this place and was very pleased to do so. Very tasty burger and good local beer. Spam Fries a bonus!

Ideal location to stop for a refreshing drink.Sit and watch the river boats going past.If you're lucky enough you could see a few river otters swimming by.They have a microbrewey on site - toilet facilities clean.S$45 for gin and tonic, magners and a wheat lime

Nice central location with river rides over boat quay. That‚Äôs all of the positives about this restaurant.Food - service slow, attention to detail lacking, some products of poor quality.Service - horrific, possibly the worst I‚Äôve experienced in Singapore.Staff are inattentive, unhelpful and refuse to take ownership. For example, when asking for the menu and being brought the bill - I don‚Äôt think that they could make it clearer how unwelcome guests are and how much of an inconvenience they are to the staf

When visiting other countries I'm keen to see what they have byway of craft beer. The RedBot was written up as a place to try. Visited this one and found the staff knew nothing about beer. Has awards all over the walls and looks good. But all form and no substance. Asked for a dark beer and was offered a lager? Has the IPA it was ok. Yep, I'm a bit of a beer snob, but if you say your a craft brewery got some people serving that at least know the difference between and IPA, Larger and Porter
2
Meet and greet fine. Taken to waterfront table with beer menu and then ignored for 15 minutes. 3 other tables arrived after us and were served before us. Second beer required much waving of arms to attract waitstaff. Seasonal beers advertised as available were not available. So standard range only which was ok but not great for the two types we tried. Abandoned visit and went elsewhere. This is the second time I have been to this bar and I had a similar experience last time. I won't bother again.

We had a really excellent meal in Red Dot Brewhouse in our favourite part of Singapore, Boat Quay.Great beers on tap as you'd expect from a Brewhouse! A huge choice of beers, ales, stouts and IPA's.The food was excellent. Great steaks, chicken dishes, pastas and plenty of salad dishes.The views of the river and along boat quay are fantastic, as good as it gets - so make sure you get a table outside at the water's edge.Great atmosphere here, excellent prompt, friendly service. We really liked it and only for the fact it was our last night, we'd definitely have gone back. I will next time I'm in Singapore though
2
The selection of in-house brewed beers was good. Recommend you sample a variety of their beers. However, be prepared to wait a while for your order to be taken or even to be acknowledged by the staff. They are willing to attract you in to their establishment but once in, you are nothing
4
We loved this place so much we went twice.Great place with seating inside and also outside on a deck by Boat Quay.Good range of Craft Beers that tasted great and were nice and cold on a hot day.The food is also pretty good with some of the best Onion Bhaji we have had and the Pork belly and Burgers are also very good as well.Great spot for Beer O‚Äôclock
4
Really nice place and nice atmosphere for the happy hour. Lots office people just right at 4:30/6 pm
Beer / BB pork... perfect combo.
Th·ªãs is Dempsey area and lots other Resturance and bar in this park. Lovely park to walk around....
5
Craft Beer in Green Color?
The House Brew just simply attract me with the color, never have any before this.
5
Service, food and ambience were great and worth a visit! Would definitely recommend my family and friends to visit! Great experience! Salted egg pizza was a to-order food as it is a comforting food for me!
5
Server Nishant and Manager Suzanne are the sweetest darlings ever!! Always making us feel welcomed and at home whichever day of the week. Ever ready to offer comfort whether you're heartbroken or jammed with work. Will always recommend!! Thumbs up!! üëçüèª
4
I like the food at this place. They have the own brewed signature beers, including the famous (brewed only there) Green beer - made from Spirulina algae :) Not my fav beer, but definitely something to try if you are visiting Spore.
4
Beer and sausages were great! Carbonara were also good. Rest is pretty much same as all other places around this area.
5
Been chilling here for more than 5 years with my friends. Ambience is nice. Food and beer choices are excellent. Love the fried silverfish, fries, nachos plus monstergreen!
Live music on weekends are a must to hear too!
5
Cannot resist visiting other micro breweries and this one is great, interesting range of beers but nothing with a very high IBU rating though the IPA was really good. Fast efficient service for food at sensible prices.Need to return and try all the other beers in particular the green on
4
Had the urge for a burger and chips and the RedDot delivered 'just what the doctor ordered' ... a big succulent burger and tasty chips ... washed down with a delicious blended lychee drink ... If you are after something slightly quirky then try the green beer.Very attentive, friendly and prompt service too.PS Boat quay is a vibrant location with a wide variety of restaurants perched by the water's edge with an impressive view of the Fullerton Hotel and river area. The surrounding circuit is also a good place for a post prandial walk after a big dinner
5
Nishant is the BEST service crew I have ever met - he greets you by name, attention to detail - the view by the river is lovely - what a great place to be. Suzzane, the manager who makes you feel at home - I am just.. amazed. Lovely place in Singapore to be. Red dot boat quay, everyone is so nice I wish I could spell everyone by name. Definitely a choice place to be in singapore. Microbrewery, local beer (they have special hidden beers - ask them for it). Cheers everyone, drink up!
4
Tried the green beer with Spirulina which was interesting. Food is good. Overall, nice place to hand out with friends.
5
Try the Green Monster, a truly unique beer with spirulina added to it giving it a bright green color.
It is a perfect gathering for friends, order a tower, and enjoy the live music!
3
We stopped in for a beer or two while we were out walking. We did not try any of the food but the beer was good.
1
Was there on a Friday night. Literally no service happened which I have to pay for. The beers was really awesome though. Kudos to the master brewer.
5
RedDot has some fine brewed beers, their monster beer is a must try with Truffle fries.
Sunday is kids day RedDot has kids activities: Fishing, face painting, baking, crafts etc. it is fun for kids and parents can enjoy their drinks. Awesome location
3
Drinking by the river in boat quay is enjoyableRedDot service is fine and prices are kept fair for the locationWhether it is a stop or a long halt, you will find a beer to your taste and the lights of the evening will make the place welcomingCheers
5
A perfect stop at the area for relaxing. Great view, service, food and beverage! You can enjoy it both daytime and evening when its a little bit more crowded...but the view is even more amazing with the lights and bridge. The food is simple but tasty. The service is perfect! I have returning to this place all the time i visit Singapore
4
Overlooking the river at the outside seating or watching the band inside, it's a good place to just chill and relax whether you're alone or with friends. my friend tried the green monster and he said it was okay. I tried the very safe summer ale and I liked it
4
Let me start with if you are a lager lover (which my wife is) then this is not the place for you. Based on other review we started with the paddle taster selection and I really enjoyed the green beer and lime beer. What did catch me by surprise in a good way was the food, I had the spicy chicken wings which were full of flavour without the sauce, then the sauce made it amazing. We also had the truffle chips which were superb. All in all worth a visit if you have had enough Chinese or fish suppers on your stay
5
We liked the place so much we went twice on our recent holiday. The first time we sat and had a tasting paddle, and then a pint of our favourite beers next to the water. It was definitely the busiest spot on Boat Quay at this point! The beer is great, make sure that you try a taster/ a beer paddles before ordering...as I probably would have gone for the green beer had I not (it's a cool colour, but really didn't get much through on the taste). We later came back for a drink in the evening, it's really nice getting the buzz around the Quay, and the lights reflected on the water
4
Very relaxing place to have dinner and beer after work. Prices are very reasonable and affordable. Certainly like to visit this restaurant again.
4
Had a late breakfast here , great hamburgers, full of flavour. Service was excellent, and of course the beer was good.
5
Good microbrewery and in a great location. Try the Indian Pale Ale and a special green beer flavour.
1
Food and view is good but service is so bad it's almost comical! Tried to book table online which didn't work, then called which was answered by a very confused person who struggled to book the table. When arrived all orders slow or forgotten. Then we were told to leave a table at 10pm but they took ages to bring last drinks and bill. Then staff got frustrated with us! So rud
4
Great bar in fab location on Boat quay. My boyfriend loves craft beer so we were aiming to visit a different craft beer establishment each day of our trip. This is the only Singaporean owed micro-brewery. Got chatting to the barman about what beers we liked and he allowed us to taste before we bought a full pint. We liked the Seasonal brew-this one was whiskey oak aged. Also the lime-wheat- fabulous finish and also the banana and orange flavoured beer! Note this bar suggests food pairing for every beer but unfortunately we had just eaten. Go during happy hour and get chatting to the lovely and knowledgable staff
4
I've been to RedDot twice, and I definitely enjoyed my second time more. We picked a table on the first floor the first time we were there, but it was a little too noisy for our liking although the music was pretty good. We were seated on the second floor during our next visit, and it was definitely quieter! The ambience was great and we definitely had a great time with the food and drinks. If you like live music, you may prefer the first floor. Overall, the experience was pretty decent and I'll see myself back there again soon!
5
Don't bother with the others. The guys at Red Dot are the only ones in Singapore who use the right water for their beer, and 99% of what makes a good beer is in the water they use. I've been a regular here for years. If you spot a skinny Indian dude, do drop by and say hello.
3
We were looking to grab a quick snack as we arrived earlier that day. We had a meeting nearby the river and wandered around.The place was the only place packed between the different outlets on the river so we decided to give it a try.They have some interesting beers, I tried the green one which turned out to be very good.Unfortunately the dining experience was a bit different. The food was oily, bad, with no taste. I had the chicken burger and I think I received some sort of an engineered kitchen. We also ordered the veggie burger which was basically 4 oily mushrooms.Come for the beer and maybe the fries
3
I met up with some friends here for drinks on a Friday evening. The service is friendly and really pretty good. We didn't face any difficulties having a split bill. This place is supposed to be a brew pub so I tried their IPA. It was really "overhopped" so I don't recommend it. I also had a couple of pints of San Miguel and those were OK. My bill for 3 pints ended up at S$39.00 which is actually considered quite reasonable in Singapore. They have live music starting around 8pm, so if you're meeting here for a conversation that's worth knowing as you might have a hard time hearing each other when they are playing.I would go here again. It's probably a better bet than some of the other places along the Quay
5
Went in with a couple of friends on many occasion. The green monster is a must try, get the tower and it will be an interesting experience. The service is fast and the food is good, it has a nice view of the Singapore River and has a live band. The overall ambiance is the reason why the place is almost packed every weekend.
3
I went to this place with a few friends, cozy environment but nothing really fantastic. Lots more other places in Singapore with such ambience and at a cheaper price.
5
Excellent food ever I had people very kindly and service long time no late no delay it was perfect time we were so hungry
5
had a fun birthday celebration over here. good food and good company in the best most chilled bar. Always pricey when having a dinner at boat quay. But its all good.
3
Had an event for afterparty here with finger snacks. Foods are good although they're kinda slow to refill.
First floor has live music. 3rd floor has nice view.
4
An unpretentious & convivial drinking hole unlike many in the vicinity.
Good brews and delish grub make for a wonderful chillax session whether with friends or business associates.
Oh, did i also mention the prompt & courteous service?
4
Be prepared for the next day - those chilli mussels are something else - so yummy with ice cold beer ... just have something ice cold for your 'dot' the next morning!
4
Beer was house brewed, with wonderful colors. The price was reasonable for a freshly brewed beer and food was also good.
4
Some very interesting Beers on offer my Favourite was the Monster Green Lager Beer - the least Favourite The Lime Wheat Beer - Food was good but like everything in Singapore quite expensive
4
I went with my friends for a small get together. I have been there twice and it was nice experience. nice food btw.
1
We (group of 4) requested for table by the riverside and the crew proposed that we start ordering sitting at the 2nd floor table and that we will be moved down when the next table becomes available. This never happened even after being there for 4 hours. The nice words are a trick they use to lock the customer and once you get locked you know what‚Ä¶They served beer without even providing a coaster for the glasses leaving the table all slippery with water from cold beer glass. When the pizza was ordered, they didn‚Äôt even provide plates, cutleries or serviette, even after noticing us using the hands to eat the pizza.They either do not know what is service (but knows to add service charges in the bill) or they take customers for granted (once locked you are at our mercy mentality)
4
His place has one of the best place to choose in terms of the variety of beers.
Its a must stop place to explore in the craft beer culture.
4
Just stopped for a drink whilst wandering around the area; ended up staying for lunch.
Good food, as others have said laid back atmosphere and good beer choice.
Several locals having business lunch so obviously well thought of
Really enjoyed it here
5
Always a great place to meet friends for a drink after work in the CBD.
World class location in a very lively part of town surrounded by great restaurants.
4
Great Food in a laid back venue...great hangout with friends. Never fails us in terms of food and service
3
Touted as the first local microbrewery, this brewhouse has retained its charm through the years. It continues to serve a good selection of beers and its food menu has also been improved by new offerings with local touches.
5
Craft beers from Singapore's only Singaporean brew master and his daughter. Unusual beers and standards. Value food offerings to accompany
5
The ambiance was really great with live music to keep you entertained. The brewed beer and cocktails was excellent and best of all the service was fast and very friendly. Kudos to Julie!
5
Their beers are incredibly good. Thank you for great service during my visit esp.Susan and Paul. ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
3
It is one of the many bars and restaurants along the river. They have a selection of their own beers that are pretty good for Singapore but doesn't compare to the US. Looks like there are live bands at night and some bar food are served.
4
Came here with a group of friends in the evening for after work drinks and it was pretty nice with the Singapore River beside. The beers are mostly decent, but most interesting thing about the place is the Green Beer! Overall a pretty nice place to hang out with friends, although i prefer the other branch at Dempsey
4
fancy something brewed here in Singapore?
the Red Dot signifies Singapore as a red dot on the atlas.
however, this place is no little red dot.
it brings out what we can brew!
and food to go with the great choices of drafts.
ENJOY!
5
Awesome beer,Great water view and hotel fullerton view,Good food,kitchen closes at 10:30 pm so visit before that.
5
Food's taste good, variety of drinks, friendly staff and last but not the least the location is excellent. What else you're looking for!!
3
i have dinner with close friends here nearly 1 year ago. the westen food is delicious, the price is reasonable.
4
Was happily surprised when i tried their wide variety of beers especially their Green one! Came here last weekend and will definitely come back again! (:
5
Red is great place to have freshly brewed beer
Green Beer + Chicken Fagra+ riverside = Awesomeness :)
4
Has an interesting selection of craft beers. Well worth spending a friday evening unwinding with friends.
5
The RedDot Brewhouse, in the few years since opening, has become a very popular venue for both local residents and visitors to Singapore to enjoy freshly brewed beers, complimented by an excellent dining experience. The service staff are attentive and friendly- and helpful in explaining the menu options. The setting in the restored military barracks building and luxuriant tropical gardens provide the perfect environment for a memorable lunches or dinners, or perhaps just enjoying the beers and company of friends
3
Indicated by its name, yes, this place is well known cause of its beers. Not the right place for you if you expect the serious dining experience or avoid the meal without beers. Yet, this club has a good location, so it will suit for those of you who only find the ambience and the snacks
3
Located along Boat Quay, RedDot has been here for some time now. Their Lime beer is quite tasty and really good for the hot Singapore weather. Food is average. The spaces are a little tight. Spirulina beer gives you green poo the next day so be prepared
4
I've only been there once. Would love to try their food. Burgers look great. Beers were good. Alfresco.
3
The beer here is pretty good, nothing spectacular but it's nice to get something local. The food is okay too. Boat quay is a nice place to be.
4
Nice chilling place with live band performance. the green colour beer is unique and taste good as well. Reasonable price.
4
green because it contains a cancer beating algae.....nice taste and the glass is worth a photograph against the river background
4
I've been to Red Dot twice in the last few years - both times to drink the fantastic green beer and other draughts they have available.The beer is good and there is plenty of variety. The food is mostly fried but good with the beer.The atmosphere is great and the boat quay area is always a fun place to be for an evening out.
5
Visited this place in evening and was packed with many customers and staff managed to still allocate table for 2 of us. Food was served fast and portion is big. They have many varieties of beer and my favorite is the green color one which is also the most popular one. The beer is much better and smoother than the bottled beers. Will come again as can't find this taste anywhere else
4
Come early and get a table by the waterside. Good I house beefs and a wider range of drinks. Good bar snacks and food too. View is excellent and almost worth the trip alone. Friendly staff and is good value for the area. Went several times on last visit and will go again.
4
There were 6 of us for dinner. We sat at a large table looking out at the river and were able to enjoy a lantern release from across the river. We had spam fries, satay, chicken gyoza and some other items. I enjoyed the lime wheat beer and other members in our party had some of their other brews. Most of the diners sit outside, the inside of the restaurant is really the kitchen and a bathroom, although there is space to dine inside but it is much nicer to dine on the riverfront. I would go back for beer and a snack or meet friends there for a pint
5
I'm an frequent flyer to Singapore & I never missed to go this place . Probably everyday i used to go for this wonderful river view bar near to raffles !! The staffs are really cool also I knew few them names as well Shallum, Paul , Suzan, Nuna.. They always serve with their smile,sweet talk & of course quick serve !!Here the place they serve their own brew different colourful beers. Can get red, green,yellow...don't know still how many colors on the way...prices also reasonable. My all time favorite is spicy chick wings & silver fish.( Must try). I always used to see many Indian customers same like me stuck there. I wish they must serve spicy& crunchy Indian finger foods as well. I'm eagerly Waiting for my next visit to Singapore to hangout this my favorite bar!! Guys, Keep up the good work !! Love you all!
5
Food ~ As someone who has eaten at many Asian restaurants, I would say that the food here is outstanding. The food definitely tastes as good as food from home.Atmosphere ~ great atmosphere one of the best river view restaurant in singapore Music ~ lovely live music Friendly Staff ~ last but not least, amazing people especially Suda, Paul & JeffWill definitely come back
3
Is full of expatriate and crowded. Very alive and loud music. If you prefer a quiet place for food and drink, then this is not the place.
4
Visited with friends. The bar was very lively and seats were at a premium. Live music was very good. Tried the green beer! Fun place to drink
4
Great place to hang out in the evenings. Make sure to try the green beer for the full experience! :)
4
Thumbs up: Green beer, right by Singapore river, and hopping music; Thumbs down: Slow service, average food, and dark lighting.
4
Sit by the river and enjoy their local brews- they have something for everyone's taste. The green one is particularly popular.
3
Good location and ambience for a small get together for beer and food. Pricing is average for a pub in Singapore. Quality of food is decent.Good mature crowd so if you want a chill out night with your guys or ladies it is a place to consider
4
The red dots are actually from Singapore. They are a microbrewery in Singapore and they serve the special green beer. This is because the beer were infused with Spirulina ( a kind of plant material taken from the sea) and that makes it green. The Spirulina is actually very good for health and beauty and is well known for its antioxidant qualities. Their beer are cheaper during the happy hours and are available in pints and half pints. As for food wise, it is the usual beer food. But some of the notables are Chicken Fagra, the name was derived from Viagra meaning that the dish gives equal effect if you consume it. Well, I must say it is not for the weak stomach. Only challenge this if you can take really hot and spicy food and able to handle it together with alcohol
3
it's on the water along a strip called Boat Quay(facing Singapore Bay). The water that comes up along the edge(not just here but all along the strip) is dirty and there is trash, etc. Every once in a while you see a rat scurry away. The food is not bad, the drinks are not bad - but everything is very basic
2
I stopped on a rainy day with my girl friend there as they had a Oktoberfest promotion which looked good.As we looked into the menu no one attend us, so we asked if we can grab a seat. The waiter passed us the menu and left without saying anything.After a few minutes I called the waiter to order, I informed him that I go with a beer and and my girl friend like to order a bit later. My beer arrived and he did not ask if she like to order something, as he turn around I said can I order me the potato soup..Soup arrived in a timely manner and we order also spring rolls. After we finished I planned to order a main course and some beers. But after 30 minutes with empty glass and plates, I did not want to order anything else anymore. 5 tables occupied and the staff is standing 1 meter next to me and don't ask or do anything.I asked for the bill and then she asked for one more drink. Bill processing was fast and efficient. Food was good, but which this se vice..
4
We ducked into RedDot Brewhouse on Aug. 9 while waiting for SG50 celebration. Boat Quay is packed with pubs and restaurants catering to tourists and ang mos -- some restaurants overcharge, taking advantage of confusion --about SGD$ per 100 grams of crab; conversion rates; and language. RedDot offers a bit of consistency, service and cleanliness in a sea of somewhat sleazy bars and nibble joints. That's why I rate it above the "average" place on Boat Qua
4
Been twice (second trip to Singapore) and so far no complaints. The food is good, the service is good and the menu offers something for everyone. Then you add craft beer and sport, what could be better!
5
food is great atmosphere even better ! cant be better service in a great exhilarating atmosphere - fun , happy & you can easily park & go to clubs nearby & party all night !!!!
4
Good place for hang out with couple of your buddies. Great food, not too bad drinks selection and value for money too. The pizzas are fresh too.
4
Great place to chill out, they have their own brewing house and the algea beer are unique. they roasted pork belly are great too.
4
They've got a really good selection of in house brewed beers! Want your beer healthy - try the spirulina beer, it's green in colour! This year we also have the special SG50 beer! My fav is the IPA (boring I know). The bar food is good, not the best though. It also has a good view being right next to the Singapore river and has a really good buzz with all the bars around
3
I went to this place on Friday night after dinner. So, I couldn't give review on food this time. But on liquor and Whisky was good price they charged. Amount of alcohol matching price just nicely. In July 10,2015 it was a live band played at this place. The services is hard to get attention from waiters.
4
Good atmosphere and services provided by the ground staff, drinks & foods prices there are reasonable even though the location of the brewhouse is in the central business district area. A very good selection of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks there.I would recommend this place to people who are opting to find a place to chill at night beside the Singapore river
4
We had lunch among the fundonate parters & decided on reddot brewhouse at dempsey. it is convenient, has ample free parking & great ambience & of course has the best value set lunch (S$18pax for 2-course & S$22pax for 3-course, and including drink or coffee as well).
5
So next stop on my local craft brew pub tour was RedDot Brewhouse on Boat Quay.Ordered the Kolsch which was fabulous and one of my favorite styles of ales (I make one myself).Friends ordered the Summer Ale and all enjoyed that offering as well.What makes this location extra special is the outdoor patio seating along the water that allows you to enjoy the skyline of the CBD.Service was also very good, servers were constantly checking on us to make sure if we needed refills that we could ordered them without having to go find a server.Did not try the food so I can not comment on that, but maybe next time.Otherwise I highly recommend RedDot Brewhouse
4
This is a great place for a relax chill out with friends or colleagues. They serve inhouse homebrew beer, the green beer ( sprilina as an ingredient ) which is particularly special. Mild and easy so suits even the lightest drinker. Food is ok.Live band available on Fri/Sat which adds to the atmosphere. And there is also a beer drinking competition on every Fri around 10.30pm so do come and be sporty, join in the fun ! Even if you don't win, you get to down a free pint 
4
relaxed venue for sate (barbecue), pizza, and over 10 kinds of draft beer served on a dispenser.
and yes, they literally had green beer. but i won't tell the secret of the color, except to say that the ingredient is a health additive.
5
Great food and beers. The wheat lime beer and the seasonal dragon fruit beer are delicious. The teriyaki pork sandwich and the red dot burger are AMAZING! Very good!
5
The bartender mr. Shalom was very accommodating and entertaining! Me and my friends really enjoy when he started to do some flairing.. salute for him... and the rest of the team..
4
We tucked in for one drink and enjoyed the flavor. The bartender was really friendly. The area is way too touristy for me and I don't think I'd like to eat here but it wasn't bad for grabbing a pint.
4
After fighting (almost literally at one point) our way past over-pushy touts outside overcrowded restaurants we came across the relative calm and spacious RedDot. There were loads of people sitting at the bar and eating food at the tables, but they looked like suits and ex-pats enjoying an evening out. We chose to eat here because they had no tout and no pictures of their food outside. (go to Boat Quay, you will understand). The service was good and the food was very good. I had a grilled-to-perfection Wagyu rump steak because I'd never heard of it before. My wife had seabass fillet on a bed of egg-pasta which she absolutely loved.The beers were excellent. I don't know if they come form a micro-brewery or what, but they were like a european Pilsner meets American craft beer, and so many distinctly different choices. We were given a table right on the edge of the Singapore River and the views and ambience were just great
4
Just been to this Brew house would fully recommend it to people , if your tired of Clarke Quay and fancy going somewhere different I would head to this place , I had the chicken burger with truffle fries and food was tasty had two pints of this spirulina beer and it was soon good !! , beer was light and refreshing with a good taste , I'm glad I tried something different , it's delivered to you in a tall pint glass and is green would recommend it if you want to try something different its a light beer if people prefer a lighter beer ! , thumbs up hope you all enjoy , service was good and accommodating when we wanted to move tables .
1
It's a great location, nice for a beer with partner or friends, but do not try the food, it's really really bad. I wonder why such a nice place do not invest more in food quality.The service was also very good, fast and very gentle
4
Great little place on Boat Quay with enthusiastic, friendly staff and excellent keg ale. The Summertime ale is light, crisp and refreshing whilst the IPA is a big tasty 6% beast reminiscent of Thornbridge's Jaipur. Excellent spot for a happy hour beer before 8, do various sizes but a pint is $11. Enjoy
4
Hi folks ,I'm foster from Australia . I have been into this bar on January 3rd week. It was really amazing experience . They have their own brew beer with various colors !! Damn !! It's really great!! Especially the service from one staff SUZAN !!! Really she knew the customer's expectations & needs. She was very friendly & always carry smiles. She also told me that they soon start business in AUS. I'm waiting !! I LOVE REDDOT & THEIR SERVICES. Thanks a lot SUZAN !!!! Surely I'll come again during my next visit to Singapore . Cheers
5
I am a regular visitor of this place for few good reasons - the location ( next to the riverside) / my favorite monster green beer and excellent staff esp Suzan who is very customer oriented and makes us comfortable in every visit. Have introduce many folks to this place and everyone has given a good feedback about the brewhouse and Suzan. If you are looking for a perfect place for a weekend evening - I would recommend this place and don't forget to try Chicken Fiagra ;-)
4
We enjoy a good microbrew. This is a nice one that is along the river so it is pleasant to sit and just relax.
4
Went here on Christmas Day for a drink. It's a nice place to sit and watch the water. Nice beer as well.
5
Everything was perfect and it all goes back to Liz of RedDot BrewHouse! Venue exclusivity and the best price was promised and the view from the balcony/alfresco was resplendent!! My guests loved the food and the kitchen was extremely prompt with the replenishment of my buffet spread. The staff were efficient and lovely. Liz ensures that every need, no matter big or small, is catered to and is flexible with the client's (my) personal terms - the layout was everything I had in mind and more and when I needed help with my photo-booth set-up, Liz was swift and creative with the handling.Pre-party, Liz and her team were superbly prompt with their responses which, for me, serves as a guarantee that my party planning went smoothly.During the party, Liz and her team were helpful and hospitable.Post-party, Liz and her team were gracious and wrapped things up well.NO REGRETS hosting my function with Liz and her team at RedDot BrewHouse. I absolutely recommend RedDot BrewHouse as I think that you'll definitely be paying far less for what you're expecting to achieve

Nice beer selection, cold and quick service. Had good variety of food for brew type / pub restaurant. Went on Friday night and was fairly crowded- host was helpful to find a place to sit for two. We had fish and chips (light batter and good portion) and portebello sandwich. Good flavor and hot to the table.

I caught a drink at the RedDot Brewhouse right after work with a friend. The Monster Green beer is really awesome. They have a wide selection of beers that you wouldn't get to try otherwise and the starters work really well with the beer. The view is of course awesome and if you get a table right at the edge, you're literally on the water while sipping a beer which is a great experience. Despite the happy hours, it is pretty heavy on the pocket although definitely worth a visit at least once

I love to hang out with friends at this Brewhouse cos there's good collection of beers from ale to lagers. And they serve the best pork knuckles in town! Crispy on the outside and juicy inside. They also serve Charcoal Grilled Sausages and Steaks.Don't forget to try their Chicken Fagra! !!! Friday nights are usually crowded but great foods are worth waiting....Definitely will be back :

Compared to other brewpubs around this area, the Red Dot BrewHouse comes up short. The green beer, once you're over the colour novelty, tasted a bit like watered down lager. Food was average but perfectly acceptable (pizza seemed frozen or at least the base wasn't home made though I'm not sure they claim it is), and tables here are cramped together with no apparent smoking delineation. Has the feel of a bar, not a BrewHouse.

What a brilliant night out this was. Our party of 6 thoroughly enjoyed the food, ambience & atmosphere here although my husband & myself were feeling down as we were leaving Singapore in the early hours of the morning. It was a night to remember where even the staff were so happy & full of fun. Our grandchildren (aged 12 & 7) were made to feel part of the evening with the staff dancing along with them to the German Oompah Band. The food was superb, very fresh & cooked to perfection even though we all had different meals. The green beer was also really nice & so was the wine. Definitely a night to remember for all the right reasons

RedDot Brewhouse is as good as any place to sit and watch the world pass by at Boat Quay. I went for the beer and there was a good range of styles and a couple of seasonals. Singapore beer prices are a little ridiculous and even if you buy the 3500ml tower of beer to share it is still about $9 a pint. The Monster Green Lager is a fun beer - given it is lime green in colour. Quite potable. Didn't eat there

dropped in here while wandering around Boat Quay. Beer list is good, tried a few of the beers. As a brewer myself always on the lookout for something new. Started with the Monster Green Lager, was intrigued by the name. Turns out it was a good choice, very tasty and refreshing. Weiner was also good, very refreshing. Didn't try the food as it was the start of our night, menu did look good though. If we have time will go back.
