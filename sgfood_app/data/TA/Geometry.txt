We went to this gelato/cafÃ© with friends and experienced the signature hearl grey tea ice cream as well as some perfectly baked waffles. Everything was delicious and the two owners were super friendly ! We had a perfect time there, I highly recommand this place ;

Looking to cool down on a hot stifling day in the old estate of Jalan Bukit Merah? Go find this little cafe for a refreshing gelato. Clean and lightly decorated, the 3 girls behind the counter will tend to your every request with an eager to please attitude. Seating is limited as expected from a shop house, and the cafe can be buzzing with customers. However, the easy laid back cafe feel will make you feel at home. If you like something hot, you can even have a waffle
