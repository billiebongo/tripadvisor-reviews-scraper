First time here. We ordered a chicken burrito and a chicken rice bowl.
It was fast. Food tasted ok. The only thing I can say negative is that the temperature of the food wasn't very hot upon receiving our food.

This should be a 3.5 review. Food is good as is the service and value. Really liked the ambiance- especially music

Thanks to Ice Tropez's review. I finally found a place that serves good mexican food. Friendly service crew too. A great place for gathering.

Food was good, i ordered Mexican rice + chicken. While, service was unacceptable due to there was only 1 nice waiter available. However, understanding him, unable to complain him since only him working during that busy hours.

After work beers. Great idea the restaurant offers a bucket of beers in a calm and relaxed atmosphere.
Though there is no unique difference between this and he many others in the same area.

After having visited some "mexican" places at Clarke Quay and Haji Lane, I had almost given up hope to find a decent burrito in this city. But here you will find it, tasty & delicious! Somehow I understand the mixed reviews - if you are used to eating the local version of mex-food, tasteless, cheesy and plasticky. This place is fresh, enough spicy and the idea of designing your own burrito is nice as well. Also the Margarita is worth a try

There was a long Q when we passed by Mexout FES while we were looking for a place to eat. Out of curiosity, we joined the line fingers crossed...hoping to have a good mexican food. I ordered a burrito and was able to choose my fillings and salsas. My barbacoa beef burrito didn't fail me. I was impressed with the food, the salsa taste fresh and the service is good. The place looks gloomy though. But all in all, the food is great and cheap. No doubt people are queuing.

First and last time dining at Mexout - Vivocity. 0/10 would not recommend to any living or dead soul. Pressured and rushed into finishing our meal, can't even enjoy our cocktails at your supposed "happy" hour. God knows we'd be cursed if we ordered the bucket near closing time. Self serviced the cutlery, no water was served. No problem there. Your server with an accent wss very kind to offer us a joke, and that was him working on Christmas. When we tried to cheer him up with some light talk, we were met with extremely sarcastic remarks. Practically zero service satisfaction, teach your staff some manners. We are not your friends, so DO NOT run your mouth off like we are. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Clearly your staff hates working on Christmas, so do your company's reputation a favor and sack the living life out of those depressed beings. All in all, fantastic end to Christmas! Round of applause for y'all, hear it yet

Came here for a few beers last night with some friends. 5 Coronas were only $25++ which is a very good price. We made the mistake of also ordering some food. It was pretty awful: I would suggest eating elsewhere. Nothing wrong with the beers though

With a craving for Mexican food, I thought I'd revisit Mexout: my favourite Singapore cantina! I wasn't disappointed; in fact the food and the ambience were as good as I'd remembered.It's simple: you just choose your base, main filling, and salsa; then if you wish, just add sour cream, guacamole or tasty cheese.I had a burrito with Mexican rice, black beans, and lettuce. I added a filling of char-grilled lean chicken with tex-mex dry rub, lemon, paprika and black pepper. Then for my salsa, I chose salsa verde, with tomatillo, cilantro, lime, jalapeno, serrano chillies – which had a nice zing to it! All topped off with some guacamole and a nice cold Corona, San Miguel – perfect!My friend chose a salad bowl with lettuce, cabbage, pinto beans, Pico de Gallo, and cilantro-lime dressing. Her main filling was Vegetable De La Cruz: capsicum, onions & garlic stewed in a spicy tomato sauce, with guacamole, topped with salsa: Pico De Gallo, with tomato, cilantro, red onion, jalapeno. She accompanied this with a margarita!Relaxed, great flavours, and not expensive. The perfect Mexican experience in Singapore

Dropped in here tried a chicken taco and a veggie one. The tacos were like cardboard and the chicken tasteless the veggie one was pretty tasty but gone in one messy bite. Dissapointing

Have you ever seen a car crash in slow motion? Everything looks fine and little by little it all falls apart - Mexout has been coming apart little by little for the last 12 months and now it's time for the paramedics to arrive. At opening, this was THE new Mexican joint in town, and there are plenty - I was an avid supporter, sometimes lunching here 3 times a week - great food, great friendly cheeky service, fast food concept and good value. Then the staff changed - and changed again - and changed again - and again.... Then they start messing around with the recipes - the chicken used to be awesome, charred and spicy, showing love in the kitchen - now's it's a bit limp, soggy, lacking punch and insipid in the burrito - only one type of beans has been on offer, initial they had "run out" but now they have run out for months and this is no longer a menu item, more a glaring hole... The multiple staff turnovers have taken away the team spirit - the joy of having a server recognise and offer your regular order has evaporated - the burrito wraps get less and less time in the heater, making them more tough and brittle, bad news for the sauce squirting out over the diner's hands.... I could go on but I should probably stop - my overwhelming sensation today was one of deep disappointment, of the staff having let me down and themselves in the process - come on Mexout, you used to be great but now you're less than average...

I was there for lunch with a colleague of mine. I was surprised to see that there were seats available when we reached around 12:15. Being vegetarian, options were limited. The food was okay-ish. Will I go there again - may be. Definitely worth a try once.

Gracias MexOut, I'm Mexican have been living in Singapore for a year and have had terrible Mexican food even from the highly rated places but the burrito I just had at MexOut was on point (of course without the lettuce, Mexicans do not put lettuce in burritos!!). I tried the barbacoa my personal favourite style of meat and it was so good, I also had a bite of my friends carne asada and it was delicious. The tortillas were nice and soft, the salsas had a good kick to them. Finally a place with food that not only looks like it is supposed to but tastes like it us supposed to

Ordered the soft corn tacos with chicken, beef and pork...one meat per. Added cabbage and pico de gallo and a side order of the fire roasted salsa. Not impressed. The meat did not have much flavor, the pico was translucent not rich in color and taste and the salsa was just ok. What hit the spot was the corona extra

Great authentic mexican food at a more reasonable price than the rest. Menu is limited in variety to mexican "street food" - tacos, burritos and salad/rice bowls, but the meat fillings are to die for. We tried the cochinitas pibil (pulled pork), carne asados and grilled chicken; all three were bursting with flavours. These were paired with homemade salsas, in particular the salsa picante was excellent. Churros were fat and had a wonderfully crispy exterior, the interior could do with a bit more body and chewiness. Chocolate sauce and cinnamon sugar were good. I would recommend that the chefs come up with some mexican soups, maybe sopa de lima would be a nice appetiser option

Situated at walking distance from Tanjong Pagar MRT, this is an awesome place to take friends out for lunch. It gives that cozy feeling right in the middle of the hustle and bustle noon rush in Singaopore. Do check out their burittos, they are definitely worth a tr

Really its fast mexican food. They have given it a twist of yummy salad inside it. I was surprised to eat such yummy vege good. Dont forget to try the spicy dressing with the salad/wrap, its one of the best. Also they have this unique drink called jaritos (or smthg) with different flavours. Its a good departure from the cokes and pepsis of the world
5
I am not religious but just had a divine moment. Not to knock anyone's faith but every taste bud had a dance with the burrito I just had...Thank you for being here. Ever grateful for the flavours you packed into that thick foil roll. Just delicious!If you love Mexican, DO NOT pass go until you collect an experience here
4
It is small place with a nice ambience. The food was tasty. They have nice vegetarian options as well. I found my vegetarian taco to be tasty but really spicy (and I am used to eating spicy food).If you want to try the veg. variation and do not like very spicy food , it may make sense to tell them in advance. The service was friendly. We would like to eat here again
5
We went here today as my boyfriend is a coeliac and we had researched that they do gluten free taco. They were fantastic. We both enjoyed them. Its a cute little restaurant with a nice vibe to it. We would eat here again.

Great soft tacos & nachos. Try their amazing shredded pork (I'm not pork fan, usually have beef). Pity they only do nachos after 5....

I love the metal tolix-style chairs, the army mess dishes, the cool music and the hip decor. The food is excellent too. Very efficient serving technique at lunchtime. More relaxed table service in the evening. You should definitely go.
5
and so much of it! come early or expect to wait in line before making it to the bar! but worth every minute of waiting.
5
Great spot for a quick dinner and quality margarita - food is great, quality guacamole, pulled pork and the tacos were spot on!!! We will be back, we are lovers of Tacos and all they bring, MexOut ticket all the boxes

It was our first time here and it was bad. Would be nicer if the food was hot!! We didn't expect cold plates for dinner.

If you are downtown in Singapore and feel like having something to eat together with a beer then Mexout is great option! I had a burrito (large) and it was great. I sat outside and enjoyed my burrito with a Corona while watching people walking around on the paved street. Nice

I've been popping in and out of MexOut when in need of something simple. I think i agree with other reviews suggesting it's the best Mexican in the area, but that's because it's the only in Mexican in close proximity to the CBD. The following contribute to my 2 point rating:1. The staff spend more time mucking about with each other than getting you through at speed (it's meant to be fast food!). They also seem very grumpy when they have to serve you and basically shout you through the process (especially if you need clarification at any point)2. The price only ever goes up. When you don't take complimentary items the price doesn't decrease but as soon as you take one of the many add-ons it racks up very quickly. Overall I think the prices are extremely high considering the shortfalls.3. Lack of good wrap making ability. There is a tendency to just dollop what you've asked for into the wrap, so when you eat you don't get evenly distributed content, this may seem petty to some but I believe ruins a good wrap (if you ask for them to spread things out it's met with more grumpy faces!)So yeah, overpriced, rubbish service and not well made. However I still pop back because I love a Mexican wrap. If you want a really decent Mexican, pop to the one on Haji lane

This is the best Mexican I've been to in Singapore. The others seem to be owned by people who haven't really eaten really fresh Mexican food. These guys must have been to Mexico or California as the food is really authentic & fresh. Atmosphere is good too & a good CBD location. Will go again
5
Absolutely love love love this mexican food!! Absolutely mouth watering nachos and the best burritos on the planet. Walk in select your toppings and they make it right in front of you.We love the shredded beef, the black beans, the mixed peppers, cheese and the pineapple dressing.Seriously don't go past this restaurant. It's casual, delicious and addictive!!! Eat in with friends or take away.Mouthwatering food. Fun casual ambience. Won't break the bank!Be sure to try the margaritas!!

Love this place - great food! If you go outside of the rush time, the queues aren't so bad. The food is great - tasty, spicy and very fresh. Highly recommend!

Wouldn't say wow would say bad but made a nice change for lunchtime fayre, the menu has too many options for me in terms of pick one of these two of those which makes the queue quite big

I stumbled upon a review of Mexout on a news site and decided I had to try it, particularly because I love Mexican food and because it's tough to find good Mexican food in Singapore. They didn't disappoint at all. The decor is fun, very stripped down, shabby warehouse chic. The staff is super friendly and the service very prompt. We order a Margarita and beer, which we got in a couple of minutes. Our mains of veggie Nachos and Rice Bowl arrived in less than ten. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors sharp. The spice levels were just right and the portions too. I definitely recommend trying the Mango -Pineapple Salsa. I would love to go back

The food here is good. It reminds me of the burritos places I used to frequent in the US during my university days when I needed to fill myself up with limited funds. I'm significantly better off financially these days, but still feel like a person with limited funds when I order lunch here because of the cost.I commented to the girl running the cash register that this must be the world's most expensive burrito to which she quickly replied "it's because all our food is imported." I don't believe I've ever seen a farm in Singapore, so I'm not sure I buy into her argument

Made my way to Mexout which has slowly been generating interest in the CBD area for lunch. I headed there for dinner and the first thing that struck me as I entered the restaurant was its interesting décor which was made up of wooden tables and a chalkboard menu giving it a rustic look. Good music and friendly staff along with interesting charts about Mexican food added to the appeal of the restaurant. They have indoor and outdoor seating but the seats are limited, hence better to avoid the 7 – 8 pm time range in the evening. The tortilla chips were really crunchy and good to munch. The ‘Vegetarian Buritto’ was yummy and the ‘Corn Tacos’ had the authentic flavor, especially with salsas that they have catering to various spiciness levels. Some of the interesting quotes that they had put up are ‘Anything tastes good with salsa’ and ‘Life is a combination of magic and tortilla chips’. As a foodie, I agree and it added to the come-back feel of the place

Fresh, hot and very authentic! If you have tried any other Mexican restaurants in Singapore you know disappointment and being ripped off. MexOut is the first place I have been to where the cost matches the value of a good meal. The portion sizes are hearty so bring your appetite
1
45mins for a burrito is unreal. I couldnt believe it took so long to get our food from what is meant to be a high turnover "fast food" joint. After all that, the burrtio not very good and the tacos were horrible! Not worth going at all
5
I read some mixed reviews on this place before going. Everyone always has an opinion and after trying myself it would seem those people who aren't the biggest fans are those that tend to write the reviews. I really enjoyed my experience. the place strikes the right balance between quality food and fast service. I can understand some saying the $13 starting price for a burrito is a stretch, but I know better after working in CBD for 3 years - most western foods cost about that. I regularly pay $13 for salads most days! The food itself is unlike anywhere else in singapore - its not mexican, more like fresh mex. Reminds me of Chipotle in the USA actually. I have been back several times and become a regular of sorts. I recommend it to all my friends as an alternative to the CBD lunch spots and a great after work place for a quick bite and a beer. But don't take my word, give it a try yourself

Decked out in a trendy seating, MexOut embueds a modern Mexican cuisine. As you stand by the counter absorbing what is on the menu, the selection dawns upon you. It is not a quick and easy order. The counter resembles a fast food concept. The fillings to the tacos, nachos, burritos are all by the counter. Yes, it is all pre-cooked.The prices are deceiving. Any add ons are extra charge. In addition, there is a 10% service charge added to the bill. As patrons having to stand in line to order, pay at the counter, take my food away with me and find a seat doesn't exactly scream customer service to warrant a service charge to the bill. This is daylight robbery in a diner that is essentially a fast food restaurant.The food is bland. The taste of the fillers are generally the same. Unfortunately, we can't say there was anything spectacular in the menu that we would come back for...

This is regarding lunch, not the evening meal. They have a great location, a good system, well explained, for building up your meal in stages. So, it is potentially all there ready to go. The problem is the actual food. It is average, not exceptional. It looked tired and tasted average. The food was was not value for money. The service was not great. While dealing with the public can be wearing, having a face which says "make your mind up, now!" does not help. I know Tex Mex but many do not in Singapore, including my friends, so a bit of effort into explaining yet again, what is what, with a smile is really part of the deal. So, average food and not value for money
