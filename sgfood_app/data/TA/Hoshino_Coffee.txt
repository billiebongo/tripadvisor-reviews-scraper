had a dinner promotion for 2 that was value for money. and as always, dessert was on point (ordered the matcha pancake)
4
Service was quick and good. The place wasn’t too noisy so conversation can take place. Food is good and well presented.
4
Hoshino coffee always provide good customer service however the outlet at Capitol was quiet and ambience was good.
4
Not crowd and conducive chill up place to spend time with friends. Tried and like the ice fruit tea.
4
The souffle was really by good but it took 35 mins to arrive and the coffee took 20 mins to arrive. That's just too long. It was moderately busy but by no means crazy.
4
The food is delicious. But the desserts are the standout.. the soufflé and pancakes are special. Must try!
2
Had the most disappointing Matcha Millie crepe. The crepe was layered with bland tasting matcha cream which was rather underwhelming.
5
The service at capitol piazza was impeccable! Friendly and very thoughtful staff and we felt very comfortable in our mini booth for two.
5
Steak was a little overdone and noticeably smaller in portion compared to the appetizing photo on the menu. But everything else tasted really great! Love the souffle pancakes, pasta, even the side salad and wedges tastes good. Toast was done perfectly. Must try their fruit tea. Very refreshing for a hot day. Service was impeccably thoughtful and hospitable, definitely better than many restaurants out there. Love the atmosphere here, it's quiet and conducive so we didn't even notice time fly past. Thank you for the wonderful experience and we'll be back

The service staff at Hoshino's Capitol branch are great! Friendly and super efficient. Water was topped up regularly and they responded to the service call button very promptly. The food came quickly enough too. Love the lobster bisque spaghetti (no lobster though; only prawns) and the soufflÃ©s. The coffee is good too!
4
Just enjoy the food here. And the coffee is good too. Overall a bit towards the pricey side but worth it!
5
Love the ambience with well-decorated interior lighting. Seat are cozy and spacious. Meals are generous portion and tasty. Will definitely visit again.
4
Located right at the basement of City Hall MRT station. Ordered the slice beef and my hubby commended it as well cooked.
4
Overall pleased with the service.
Was abit taken back when waiter tried to clear my food when I've yet to finish but I think its the exuberant and good attitude.
5
Had lunch here. The wasabi cream salmon pasta was fantastic. Really great tasting and a good deal for the price.
5
The dessert was wonderful. So were the avocado and prawn sandwiches. Service was attentive and polite. Well worth a visit!
5
Although there were not many staff, they were prompt and fast. All our food were served at the same time so we dont have to wait long for each other. Definitely will recommend to my other friends.
4
I like hoshino for its zen japanese feel. The simple but well done food. And the friendly service. Will be back
3
overall good food, pancakes are nice, but the service was quite slow, especially the ordering. suggest to visit during non peak hour
4
We went to the Capitol branch, not crowded at all. Service was okay (there's a super young lad, seems like a trainee, he could be more attentive), then there was another older guy who served who seems more experienced and friendly.Food was great, quality. Portion of steak is tiny compared to the chicken (like x3 bigger!). Drinks are also very decent.There was a promotion for 2, dinner set at $60++. While it looks cheap, I think there is not a huge difference if you ordered them ala carte unless you're taking all the priciest items on the menu
4
Fantastic all round place. Whether Lunch, dinner, dessert or even a drink, this place hits all the right notes.
2
only went there because the food court was full. the food was disappointing and waitress got the wrong orders..
4
The service staff here are consistently good, well trained and friendly. Never let me down when I need to go somewhere to shut out the hustle and bustle. Great coffee and dessert do not hurt.
3
Nice cushion but got mosquito and so not very conducive to eat for long want to hurry eat and leave the place e
4
Nice helpful staff but seems to be over worked. they forget to write down one of our order even though there were 2 of us. Please help by giving them training
4
The food here is delicious and affordable. One of my favourite lunch spots when in the area. The Hoshino pasta is one of my favourites.
3
Solid range of well done souffles, pancakes and creme brulee. Also take note of their decent matcha drinks and coffee. Avoid the generic ice cream.
4
good place to sit down and chat for long hours. But the water re-filling part is quite a hassle as staff has to attend to us quite frequently. Food is not as tasty as pictures. Coffee and souffle is good
4
This is the first time i visited Hoshino Coffee. The food is very good and the ambience is nice and quiet. Service is very good too. I ordered a royal milk tea and the cup is leaking and the waitress replaced it promptly. The waiter and waitress are friendly and smiling and top up our water regularly. Will be back
4
Came across this place while walking around capitol plaza, and the ambience looks nice, so we decided to give it a try. I like this place is not as busy as Starbucks, so the staffs are more attentive & have more time clearing table. They are also very patient in explaining the questions we have on the menus. Seats are very comfy, and the capitol plaza provides free wifi at really high speed. We had the Hoshino blend coffee, hot fruit tea & Green tea pancakes. Coffee was very strong, fruit tea was refreshing, and the pancake was amazing! The pancake was as soft as cakes, and when mix with the green tea ice cream is just heavenly! It will be even better if the green tea flavour is stronger and the cake less sweet.Will be back to try other desserts again
5
Service was excellent. Decent selection of food. A quiet cafe for a good catch up with friends over good coffee and good food
3
Good atmosphere and dining environment but never meet my request I ask for cushion seat hence have room for improvement
4
Sandwiches here are delicious and a more reasonably priced option. Great place for lunch if in the area.
4
The pasta were delicious and were served relatively quickly, however the dessert took a long time to be served, probably due to larger crowd by the time the dessert order was placed.
5
Environment was simple & pleasant. Food is nice. Had the Japanese curry rice & souffle was nice & fluffy; not too sweet.
5
Waiters & waitresses are prompt and helpful to our group with kids. Highchairs are readily available. Food is within expectation. Ambience is good.
4
Food was great. But the serving time was kinda slow. Nobody responded to the bell even after pressing it. Whereas waving at the staff is even faster.
5
I enjoyed my lunch and catch up with a close friend due to cozy and quiet environment that Hoshino provides. The coffee is my favourite, freshly brewed! Service is also good with friendly staff.
4
The service was good. Food took a long time to arrive due to dinner crowd. My usual favorite is the fruit tea. I had the shrimp avocado sandwich . The shrimps were big. The steak plate was delicious too.
3
Wanted to go for dinner but food menu was slightly limited. Went over for desserts. Desserts were nice but room for improvements. Had the chocolate fondant cake but unfortunately it was slightly overdone and there was almost no molten lava in the center. Also had the souffle pancakes which were nice but slightly too thick. Price range was $10-$15 for the desserts. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall I would probably go back but hopefully the restaurant can improve for the next visit, especially for the chocolate fondant cake
4
Had the Hoshino pasta and it has delivered yet again. Love that egg which is cooked just right with soft gooey yoke. Delicious right to the last morsel.
5
Hi, service staffing were positive attitude in customer serving. Food portion was however miniscule when sets are ordered.
4
Delicious souffle with chocolate. Free flow water. I like the button to press to call for service...
1
Over cook Angus Beef Steak and stone hard potato wedges.
When feed back to service staff, he smile and asked me " Is that because of price?
What an insult!!!
Guarantee that will never come back and recommend your outlets.
5
Place was quiet and cosy. The waitresses paid attention to details and also kept us informed about waiting time for food. Food was presented nicely.
4
I have been to several Hoshino outlets and find the meals there consistently good. Desserts here are also always special with the Creme brûlée simply to die for
1
My friends and I went here for lunch on a weekday. We like the food from Hoshino Coffee in general. However the service here wa really bad. We stood at the entrance waiting to be led to a table for maybe 10 minutes even though the place was not full; the waiter ignored us as he gave bills to a few tables and a plate of food to another. It took a while to get our orders, and then much longer to get our food; we had another friend come by and the food was still not arrived. When it did arrive, it was rather lukewarm. In the middle of our meal, we asked the waiter to start preparing the 20-minute pancake souffle so that we would have it when we finished. When we requested for it, apparently they had not started it yet and we waited some more. Terrible, terrible service
1
When I saw the menu it looked impressive. But the moment we entered the place I knew it was a mistake. The waiter was unmotivated. Service was bad. The latte was the worst I ever tasted. Even the kopi c in a kopitiam tasted better. I am never going back, ever
5
Sunday lunch time, but we don't need to shout over the table as it's a quiet nice place. Setving beautiful food with enough variety. Although we had Japanese curry but the restaurant doesn't smell as other curry houses. Always recommend to friends who wish to have nice catch up and filling food at the same time.
4

Tried the deserts Vanilla Soufflé with Custard Sauce S$10.80Strawberry French Toast S$12.80Excellent desserts. Guess we just love Soufflé.
4
Nice comfy place to spend a lazy afternoon with good food & drink. But not recommended when you are in a rush as the food & drink take quite awhile to serve.
4
We were looking for a quiet and relaxing cafe to discuss my friend's wedding plans during the weekend. This place was just right!
5
Food was extremely yummy. Enjoyed the food there with few mains and drinks. The ambience was good to have good catch up with friends.
5
Went to cafe with friends and totally love the ambience and decorations of the cafe. The baked rice and spaghetti we had were delicious. Will return again
3
Pancakes were fluffy but we were too full to finish both pieces. The pasta and omu rice were average.
4
We enjoyed our evening here with the great service provided by the staff. Food is ok and well presented. Quiet ambience on a weekday.
5
very nice ambience, pancakes was a bit dry though.. not the marshmellow kind.. fruit tea was nice... would recommend
2
Food is very average. Settings aren't suitable for big group or children. The service crew was not very friendly. Won't go back for sure.
5
Nice environment and excellent food. Staff is generally friendly. Good for catching up with friends.
4
I tried the spaghetti which was value for money. The steak was a bit too tough and portion a bit small.
4
Well trained service staff.
Prices were fair and reasonable.
Food and coffee were good quality.
Good place for get together and chats.
4
Absolutely delicious pancakes.
Freshly baked to near perfection!
A definite must try for pancake lovers!Suitable place for couples or bunch of friends out for a birthday or get together.
3
Nice coffee and Japanese inspired foods. The only problem is coffee is half filled. Cosy environment and good for meetings.
5
Love the soufflé and coffee. Nice ambience and good service. We had the Tea Time Special - 2 drinks plus 1 dessert at special price. Will definitely come again!!!
4
Loved the cozy ambience and it was not noisy during lunch. Tried the seafood spaghetti in tomatoe sauce and it was nice and seafood is fresh. The portion is quite large for one person. The staff is not attentive to refill water for customers.
4
Loved the french toast and coffee. Awesome place! Enjoyed the set menu for the desserts. Will be back!
3
Tried the outlet in Suntec City. Food was very similar in standard and quality. No disappointment at all. Only down side is the attentativeness and friendliness of the staff.
3
Some hits and some misses. Depending on what you order, the food can alternate between yummy (lobster bisque soup spaghetti) and poor. Desserts and coffee were good. Service was lacking - food took some time to arrive (to be fair, the wait-staff informed us of that at the time of ordering) and water refill was non-existent, despite several reminders. Good if staff strength can be boosted.
4
After few hours in a museum. Both of us needed a place to sit and eat. Came here as I have been here few times and i like the pancakes. We ordered the beef stew with toast (anniversary special) and pot baked curry. Both tasted very delicious. We also ordered two ice coffee and pancake to complete our meal. Love the ice coffee and the pancake. Only minus side is the service staff could be more welcoming and courteous. At least try not to rush off before we finish our sentences?
3
Pretty & cosy ambience for friends get together. Hot Matcha latte was heavenly, milk cream was fragrant and fresh. SoufflÃ© and was too sweet and autumn special pancake was dry, overly sweet that 5 of us couldn't finish. We balked at the bill, it cost as much as our dinner!! Will Not return ther
