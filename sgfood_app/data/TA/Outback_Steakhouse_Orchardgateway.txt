Visited this place twice. Efficient and friendly service. Good food and drinks. Would recomment though a little bit pricey but remember, Singapore has become expensive.
3
Once again another great visit, good service, good food we weren’t disappointed. Outback is always worth a visit to enjoy their delicious steaks.
3
Visited here on business trip and food was ok without being great. One issue we did have was resolved instantly by manager and rectified with compensation. Not a bad place but not great.
1
Terrible attempt at providing the same quality of food as an Outback in the U.S or any other country. The blooming onion should have been listed as the "rotten onion". Tasked like it was cooked in week old grease. New York Strip must have been cut from a water buffalo in the Philippines. The loaded baked potato was a joke. Seen bigger moles on peoples faces. The Corn on the Cob was like chewing pellets. Dinner companion had the Salmon. Yeck! Save your money if your wanting a good meal. This is not the place to go! Definitely not worth the S$110 I had to pay for dinner

Decided to give this place a go as it’s close to our hotel. Disappointed! Very slow service, food was average, drinks not good at all.Let’s get the drinks out of the way. Ordered a couple of Tiger Beers on tap. Came out flat. No head whatsoever (even from Australian standards). This can only mean mainly 2 things; they’re washing their glasses in soap (in which the residue takes away any foam when the beer is poured) and/or (and lets hope this isn’t the case) they are not cleaning their beer lines (or at least not frequently enough).The food was average. I had a steak. It was cooked the way I wanted it but I could tell the cut wasn’t of the highest quality. My partner had the Pork Baby Back Ribs. Pretty tasteless and not enough sauce/marinade. We finished the meal and went elsewhere for dessert. One other thing, they were offering a 510g porterhouse steak yet in the photo you could clearly see it is a T-Bone steak (and yes, from the description, you do get 2 types of cut of meat each side of the bone). Need to brush up on food knowledge there!!A bit disappointed (and probably embarrassed) that this is portrayed as a typical Australian Restaurant/Steakhouse. NO! Not even close.To the scores:Food - 5 out of 10 ( A lot of improvement required here on all accounts)Drinks - 1 out of 10 (Maybe I should have returned them but I saw on other tables the same issue with the drought beers)Service - 3 out of 10 (I think the score speaks for itself)Ambience - 8 out of 10 (It was fine from that point of view)Value for Money 3 out of 10 (This is where it gets down to tin tacks. Average food and well below par drinks)Overall Score - 3 out of 10 (Won’t be back
4
We ate here a couple of times almost a year ago and had a very bad experience with both service and the food quality. We just have tried it again now twice in the last couple of months and the service has been great and the food very good both times. We will definitely return
5
My wife couldn't eat her part of the lunch that we intended to share at a dazzlingly disappointing new restaurant in Orchardgateway, so we went upstairs to Outback Steakhouse where we knew we could get a reliably good meal before going to the airport. Service, baby back ribs, and Caesar salad were all excellent--just what we needed, They even packed up the rest of the free bread and butter so that we could take it with us on the flight to Bangkok. Well worth the price. It was good to be able to rely on Outback Steakhouse quality
2
It's very expensive and variety was not very good.. taste wasn't good too staff seems very busy when the restaurant is not even half filled .. I ordered medium rare and I got a very rare one with red blood.. but location was good if u need need a quiet restaurant to rest ur feet and eat after shoppin
4
I had been in Outback Steakhouse restaurants in US and Mexica , this was the last and the most expensive one. Steaks and all appetizers are very well cooked & tasty . Menu is very good . Due to high taxe rates in Singapore , prices are very high as compared to other countries 
4
Very good option when you get tired of asiatic food (which is always my case). This outback keeps the chain standard of quality around the word (I've got say, way better than the ones settled in USA). Free wifi (ask password). They are in the 4 th floor, not to much information about its whereabouts in the mall
5
Ordered the ribeye, medium rare and it showed up medium to medium-well. I mentioned it and they took the whole plate back, no questions and brought a whole
New plate of food. That steak was spot on! Great customer service!
4
Had a delicious lunch with great service although a la carte menu prices can be a drain on the pocket.
4
First of all, the service was excellent, all the staff were very nice.
The steak was also tasty. The fried sweet potato could be less fried, but otherwise everything was great.
Overall, nothing special, but could be a good plan after a grey workday.
2
Average ribs with not a lot of meat content and pricey. Not value for money at all. Staff could not wait to clear up and hovered as you ate. Would not recommend at all
4
The night started off a bit rough as the waiter accidentally spilled an ice drink on me. he was very apologetic. I realised it was an accident. When they found out it was my birthday at the end they came in with a lovely sweet with a candle on it and presented me with a family photo. The meal itself was excellent and would definitely go back there next time we are in Singapore
4
I know there have been mixed reviews but I had a wonderful lunch here. I actually had a bad morning and so I just had to have my comfort food - beef steak! The staff were very friendly and for a start, the bread served was simply delicious! I ordered the ribeye and it was really good! Well-marbled and succulent, it was cooked just right! I also enjoyed the decadent dessert (think it's called "Chocolate Thunder", a pecan brownie with rich vanilla ice cream sitting on warm chocolate sauce). Considering it was lunch hour, the place wasn't very crowded though. I was seated at a table with a view of Peranakan Place but it also meant it took some time for the staff to notice that I was ready to foot the bill. But other than that, the meal gave my spirits a much needed lift that day!:
3
We have came here for an early dinner. We have ordered the shrimp and avocado starter. It was marvellous on the picture. Although the dish was way smaller we have first expected.We have ordered ribs and a porterhouse steak. The steak was ok, the ribs were just too dry and chewy. They were so hard that we could really struggled with them.All and all not an experience we would like to return to
4
I loved the meat here. So welcome after 3 weeks of Asian food. It is a bit pricy in my opinion but the meat was perfectly seasoned and prepared to my taste. Definately same quality as elsewhere in the world! Was pretty full so I did not even have room for dessert
3
We visited this restaurant after a good experience at the KL Sentral Outback. We were quite disappointed in comparison. The service was a little lacklustre. The meals were small by comparison but cost a lot more! Two of us had the cheesecake for dessert and one was still frozen. The place wasn't busy at all so it was overall just a very average experience and we wouldn't return, there's plenty to choose from in this area
5
Had an early evening dinner so restaurant wasn't very busy. Very attentive and friendly staff. The children enjoyed their kid's meals of chicken & fries. We had steak & ribs, a burger, chicken and pepper steak. All of which were delicious. Good value for money and excellent food
5
The food taste great!Very nice steak and pork ribs!Excellent service!Special mention for our waitress,who provided extremely good service for us.
4
The wait is quite tight but I can't complain as we went on a Friday night. The food though took so long to arrive but fortunately the wait was compensated by the good service and great food.
5
Dinner on 28th Jan 2017. Attended by Joy who was very cheerful and polite. She was also very attentive and helpful whenever we have any request. First class service!
3
Was there last week for an early dinner. Had the medium-well tenderloin steak which is juicy and value for money. The 2 side dishes dishes were of a small portion. The restaurant is just about half full but the service staff were inadequate and unattentive . It takes a while to order, a while to request for more orders and they do not have good knowledge about their food items. Perhaps they are understaffed and just had new hires.The Chocolate Thunder impressed me the most ironically, not their steak which the restaurant is renowned for. The ambience of the restaurant is decent. It would be a great experience if the service staff attentiveness and knowledge of the food items are improved. Nevertheless, this experience will not deter me from going back again but i will not travel all the way there for steaks as there are better options at competitive prices elsewhere
5
Our favourites at this restaurant are steaks and Aussie fries, love the quality food at reasonable prices. As 1 of their marketing slogan aptly says: steak done right... Indeed! Service is alright.Seating wise - during our most recent visit, we had party of 6, seating was pretty tight for the 6 of us (had little leg space); else would have been more enjoyable
3
Visited here last year and got a good meal with good service but the restaurant has gone downhill. The service was poor whilst the 'Aussie fries' were very plain with no seasoning and the steaks were just about acceptable. All very disappointing, we have visiteds outbacks in many countries - South Korea, Hong Kong, America etc and this was the first poor meal we'd had.
4
Paid a visit to Orchard getaway Outback Steakhouse and three of us ordered two steak, one pasta, one appetiser and one dessert. The Pasta was surprisingly tasty, the prawn is fresh with seasoned chicken tender Ribeye steak is juicy, well seasoned The other steak (doesn't really remember the exact name but porter____) has more fats and tendon, but it is yummy as well. Guess it would be nicer if the sauce has not taste. Appetiser: fried popcorn chicken with sauce. It is nice a always, the all time Favourite Dessert: pecan brownie with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Was served hot and it's lovely. Didn't manage to take picture of our drinks but we had two shots of baileys, and three other drinks. Service: 8/10 Food: 7/10Ambience: 7.5/10 Worth to pay a visit!
1
I am a big fan of Outback, I have eaten many times for years all over the world, but this was the first bad experience. I order the steak and ribs combo since I was pretty hungry and it came with 4 ribs!!! I have never seen a "half portion" of 4 ribs. And for $42 the plate I would say was way too expensive. Not happy at all
5
We have eaten in Outback restaurants in different cities and this one continued the wonderful experience, The staff were friendly and attentive ensuring that we were well looked after.The food was excellent and served with an unusual dark bread which was delicious.As we ate early 5:30pm we also enjoyed their happy hour - which is very welcome at Singapore prices for wine:
4
I love meat.. and after couple of weeks of Asian food was absolutely craving for my good ol'steak. I have eaten in Outback many times before and never been disappointed so googled Outback in Singapore and landed at the one at Orchard Gateway..!The restaurant is a bit difficult to find if you don't know the mall / place. But after walking and asking around reached there. The lunch time was relatively not so busy. Therefore the service was relaxed and fantastic. The restaurant was quiet, and service therefore much faster. I ordered guacamole salad and my steak well done. The portions of salad and sideys were good and fulfilling. The meat and cuts were nice and the restaurant was able to cater to my specific demands of how to char my steak. A perfect tranquil meal which I was hoping and craving for after 15-20 days of hustle and bustle of Asia.I loved it so much that my last 2 lunches before I left singapore were in Outback again, and each time I went the service and food standards were the same. Recommended..
5
We went here by chance. The kids and husband loved the steak which is the speciality here.Would recommend to all steak lovers! Its located on 4th floor, 313 somerset Mall!
4
Signature brown warm bread is always welcome
Ribeye steak tasted very good even if was rather slim. Stuffed potatoe was lukewarm so cheese was not melted.
Overall, i d say there are much better food options for 50sgd in Singapore.
3
Nice steak.
Nice beer.
Nothing special here, these kind of easy going bulk restaurants are everywhere.
2
We ate at Outback in the US before and were usually quite satisfied with the food and service. Our experience was very different this time. Had dinner there in December, just after 8PM. The service was poor, the meat was overcooked, the bread was still frozen inside (not enough time in the microwave!). Poor experience, way too expensiv
2
I've visited outback restaurant located at Orchard gateway and this will be my first visit and it'll also be my last one.Before I enter into outback restaurant I asked myself why they've lesser crowd than the other restaurant (Lenas restaurant) directly facing Outback.I've dine in Lenas twice and the food there was good; therefore I'm in a better position to comment which is good in my view.Outback was disappointing because they served me bloody beef when I asked for medium well.The middle portion of the steak was uncooked and very raw and the meat was so hard to cut and chew.That's not the worst as I'm not fussy with food.The next thing I realised that I've two floating flies in my beer.....what can be far worst than the lousy food which I'm bearing with?I've highlighted to the management and they wanted to waive the beer charges but was turned down by me.I still believe i should pay for what I've ordered and it was my decision to dine there and I shouldn't be taking advantage of such incident for my gain.I'm writing this to share my personal encounter and it does not mean that all will experience the same. But making a wise choice by observing the restaurants within that area sometime already say it all even without trying the food
4
As we were on route to Australia the irony of eating in the Outback was not lost on us. Not an Australian in sight in the restaurant. Steaks were excellent and cooked as we'd asked. The restaurant wasn't very busy so the servers were especially attentive and we really dumbfounded one server when I asked for a shandy
4
An interesting menu for Gweilos which purports to be Australian - but there are not prawns - not shrimp! - from the inland city of Toowoomba. Nevertheless the food was fresh, well cooked and greatly enjoyed by our party. The service was attentive. Would recommend a visit
4
WE LOVE STEAKS! We celebrated our 1st year anniversary, initially we wanted to eat in a much expensive restaurant however after thinking about it we decided to eat in Outback, last time I ate in Outback was about 8 years ago in Manila, so I forgot how their food tasted.The great thing about eating here on a Monday is the rebate, every 50SGD means 25SGD rebate and our bill was 100++ so we got 50SGD rebate in total, what a great deal!My husband and I both ordered ribeye steaks, cooked medium well, we enjoyed it the thickness of the steak was perfect for us and it was cooked quite well.The sides tasted ok, we ordered fries and rice for sides, the taste was how we expected.Though there are much cheaper steakhouses in SG, we would def come back to Outback, maybe ribs next time! :
3
One of many steakhouses around. Menu look impressive for steak, but nothing great or fancy. Steak is too dry, not worth paying. Ribs are merely fine, nothing over the top. May hang up with friends due to convenient location. But if you love steak, go somewhere else
4
I have dined at outback steakhouse a couple of times, the steaks are good for its price. Price wise is still quite reasonable. The best steak I had here was the prime rib with the special sauce but sadly it is not available for lunch normally. If you will be dining at here often. I would recommend you to get their membership card as it is really worth it. For $40 you would be able to get a membership card which give you 15% discount off total bills everytime you dine which is like you don't have to pay for gst and service charge. You will also get a birthday card which is valid on birthday month which give you 30% off total bills. Lastly you would get a $40 discount card and will be able to use the next visit. So you are actually paying for more benefits. Staff here are friendly and approachable as well. BTW they had complimentary bread as well^
3
Male Indian manager was very helpful and knowledgable. Service staff forgot our side orders twice. The Prime Rib was tough and chewy. Burger was tasty but a bit dry.
3
The food here are almost near fast food quality. However, the prices are low and therefore there is nothing to complaint. Steaks here are very so so only.
5
Outback is a brand - wherever in the world the food is EXCELLENT - the emplyee are trained and friendly
5
Very promt service, the ribs were deeeeelicious!!! Great baked potato, all washed down with lovely cocktails. Well worth a visit!
1
The steak was very fatty and tough, the vegetables were ok, and chips tasted of re - heating. Outback chain is Australian, but the steak and wine were not. The waitress could not explain this, we have visited Outback Restaurants before and never had a problem. We were so disappointed that we just finished our wine and left. This wad not a cheap meal
1
This was the worst dinner I ever had - I travel all over the world, was staying at the Conrad next door, and after a week of seafood yearned for a steak. The service was awful. They could not make the cocktail off the menu I requested (cucumber martini - "we don't have that sir"). So I ordered the steakhouse martini. 20 minutes later a "cucumber martini" arrived w/o garnish and so sweet that it could accompany a dessert. My steak arrived looking steamed not seared. I ordered (off the menu) the Shiraz Cabernet by the glass. "Sir we don't have that, we only have the Chianti" (with the Ch pronounced like in Charlie). On the drink menu the Chianti is "bottle only" and is the same price for the bottle as the Shiraz Cabernet (64.90). The Shiraz Caberent is 13.90 for the glass yet they charged me 15.90 for the glass of Chianti. They also automatically included a service charge. I would not have left a tip. Very disorganized, unprofessional, and unfit. This is my first post on Trip Advisor, heed my warning. Go to the Tapas place next door. It is crowded and the clientele looked happy
4
One of the first things that strikes you about Outback is that their food prices tend to be quite steep compared to the US. This 'sticker shock' is somewhat mitigated by the overall quality of the food, wide menu selection and breezy American-style service (i.e. we did appreciate solicitous servers inquiring as to how we were enjoying our meal - a rarity in Singaporean restaurants). Our meal was simple, yet well-executed: plump, well-marbled baby back ribs bursting with flavour and falling off the bone; tender black pepper steak bites served sizzling, hot-plated with fries and vegetables. It's important to note that the fries and vegetables are not mere accompaniments or afterthoughts - both were well-cooked with fresh flavour and vibrant taste, neither soggy nor bland as is often the case in inferior establishments. They truly complimented our meal. The restaurant's atmosphere is typical quasi-sports bar, unmemorable save for the good service and tasty food
4
Believe it or not, Outback has become my kids' default choice. The reasons are, I guess:1. We never ordered steak, as they are not on the kids' menu.2. The pre-entre freshly baked dark loaf with butter is a huge hit. 3. The spaghetti with tomato sauce on the kids' menu is decent.4. The BBQ ribs on the kids' menu is also well prepared.5. Both #3 and #4 come with free soft drinks 6. It is never too crowded7. The price is about S$20 per head so not too ridiculously price
2
I didn't excpect much from this place but we were hungry.I'm a chef from Australia and I ashamed that this places claims to be Australian if I served this food a reviewer would kill me.the steak was butterflied had no color on it so cold pan or grill the onion under cooked they were still crunchy.the mash my partner had looked like it was old looked brown made properly mash should not be able to scoop with an ice cream scoop it should have milk and butter in it and not look like stodge.the cutlery was not only cheap but really uncomftable to hold .ive never written any thing bad about a restaurant before. I just hope people don't think that this is how Australians cook
3
Excellent lunch promo. We ordered half-rack of ribs, but it is more of a quarter rack if you ask me. I would definitely be disappointed if that is what they serve for dinner, or if I was paying regular price. Service was excellent. One thing though: if they are having the promotion, they should notify the diners as they are seated. We knew and had to ask about it. Only then were we given the promo menu. When would the restaurants (and hotels) learn that it is the little things that count, make a big difference and don't cost much to offer
3
Steak was rediculous. Nothing like the description and tasteless. Hubby liked the babyback ribs and the kids were happy with their fries. Really over priced but the cocktails were made well. Service was good too.
4
This is the 1st time we visit outback restaurant the food is acceptable especially the steak is tender n juicy sure wil come back again in future 👍🏼
3
This restaurant is not bad, meal was quite good, service was very good, prices ok, not very expensive, portions average.
4
Server Sujol was very attentive to my friends and I during the dinner. Her service was very good as she gave us her brightest smile when she served us the food.
Quality of food is great too.
Will definitely come back again!
1
Went out for a steak with the family, turned up look warm (Steak was rather wafer thin, unlike the menu picture).Then returned same steak with all existing chips etc, obviously had been put in a microwave.Terrible meal, we complained and they gave a discount, wont be going back
1
Just arrived in Singapore went to our room and thought we'd pop out for a quick dinner nearby . What a mistake- this place is run by people who look disinterested, do not engage and have no idea what they're doing .It took 25 minutes to get our drinks which they had no idea how to make. Watching them make one cocktail the barman used his fingers all over the watermelon .The ceviche (in the photo) came out looking brown in a cabbage cup not lettuce. Completely unappealing and did not look fresh at all. Go to one of the many places nearby and avoid this place. Quality, service and food all terrible.
3
i went to this place with my husband. the appetizer was okay, the steak was quite good, but my husband order medium well steak, his steak was welldone and dried, and mine is not uneven medium well, the outside part was welldone. the price was reasonable, but if i can choose i still prefer aston's steak, especially if you compare to blackangus's steak, you know you got what you pai
1
Three of us recently visited this restaurant at Orchard Gateway with a Groupon voucher and it was very easy to see why such vouchers were being offered on the internet. You pay for what you get and in this case it was rubbish.We all ordered the 8oz steak. All three steaks were wildly undercooked when we asked for medium rare. I'd be happy to even eat rare but all three were blue. We sent the steaks back, when they returned they were absolutely no different and so we sent them back again.Two of the steaks were cooked a bit more whilst mine was cooked fresh, not sure why they decided to do this. On return it was pretty clear the steak had been partially microwaved by how it looked. The sides were not fresh and at this point I just gave up with not only the abysmal food but also some of the worst customer service I've ever seen.The staff were nothing short of brain dead. You couldn't pay me to return
1
I would like to provide feedback about the poor service that both my friends and I had encountered at the Singapore branch (located at Millennium Walk). During the busy lunch hours, I had encountered at least 2 occasions that I had to wait for more than 10 minutes even after persistent attempts to get the attention of the service staff before being served for my orders to be taken. There were also other occasions that I had to follow up with the service staff a couple of time before the bread and soup (which are part of the set lunches that I ordered) were served. I was originally under the impression that these were isolated lapses due to the inadequate staff resources during the busy lunch hours, the reasonable priced set lunches and convenience of the outlet, i kept going back. After sharing my experiences with a few of my colleagues, I realized that it is a common issue at the outlet. And after my last attempt to dine at the outlet in mid April whereby I had another such poor service, I decided NOT to patronize it anymore. I certainly would not want to be treated as "something that the cat dragged in" when I'm a paying customer who even has to pay for service charge when there is hardly any service to talk about. I believe that there is a severe lack of service staff and inadequate training provided to the existing service staff that caused the above problem. If the management is committed to stay in the competitive Singapore food industry, I would recommend that immediate and appropriate measures be taken to rectify the issue before it loses the support from its customers and eventually affect the bottomline of the restaurant
4
Celebrating my bestie birthday in the Orchard gateway outlet. The food portion was huge for the three of us (ladies). The food was delicious and super fresh. We are very satisfied with the service too. The waitress: Ms. Sujol, is very energetic and helpful too :) we are glad to be here.Food ordered:- Shrimp and Avocado Ceviche- Typhoon Bloom- Toowooma Chicken- Black Peppercorn Crusted River- Grilled Salmon- Carrot Cake with ice cream
3
Been here in the restaurant for half an hour now.Not many customers. Tables nearby are covered with plates and leftovers and no one's taking care of them but since they don't take care of us either, we are not so surprised. Staff wanders around like unmotivated zombies. Had to call some waiter so we could order.Food was good though, kitchen staff seems to have more motivation than waiters
5
No matter whether you go for a lunch, dinner or using a Groupon voucher, the stuff is always smiling, service is fast & the most importantly: every meal is excellent, especially the tomato soup, of course steaks but also salads and excellent drinks. The price level is cheap/moderate so highly recommended for the top location & singaporean conditions. As for me - would always come back, thank you
3
Do I have to say more?It's too expensive for this mini portions. I had a pasta meal for 26 SG $ and it was like an appetizer. It tasted good, but i was still hungry after this.My friend had steak with corn and fries. He got the ketchup after he asked for it 2 times. The corn wasn't cooked long enough. It's very noisy. You can't have a good conversation there. For this prices you can easly find better food in town
2
I was looking for a decent priced steak and found Outback on Google Maps. I wished I had consulted TA before I left. I got to the restaurant on a Tuesday around 5pm. It was completely empty which didn't surprise me since I was early for dinner. There was only a server at the complete other end of the restaurant so I went over and asked if I could sit anywhere. She barely replied to me, so I sat down. After about 5 minutes she came and took my order. Glass of Merlot, side salad and the sirloin cooked medium. I only waited maybe 7 minutes before my steak was placed in front of me. I was immediately disappointed because my salad didn't arrive first. The waiter apologized and promptly brought it to me. So now I have to choose to eat the cooling steak or my salad. I chose the steak. I cut into it and it was rare. Maybe a touch medium rare but pink cool center for sure. I called the server back over and said I had ordered it medium. Again he apologized and said he would put it back on the grill. This only added to my disappointment as I cut into the steak multiple times to see if any was cooked medium. Now the steak would be dry. It was. Medium well this time. On the bright side I was able to finish my salad before returning to my now over cooked steak. It was well seasoned but at this point I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. I did and won't be back to this location.
2
Looked for a place for a Friday date night dinner with my wife. We got the Outback Steakhouse groupon deal for $120. Booked the millennium walk branch as the orchard gateway branch was fully booked out. Waitress was unresponsive when we first came in. Tried to make eye contact then in the end had to ask another staff to serve us, who then asked the first waitress to take our order. When taking our order, the waitress accused me of staring at her since we came in and demanded me to explain why. The other male wait staff who served us after that was okay though. When we gave feedback to the manager, he apologised for the waitress afterwards. For the food, the Ribeye steak was good but the Toowoomba Topped Sirloin was too tough.Will not go back again. The waitress made the atmosphere really awkward for us after our order was taken. My wife wanted to walk out and I had to deliberately keep looking the other way when she came to our side of the restaurant after she took our order!
1
After running into lines everywhere one night I took a customer here for a late dinner. Having been to Outback in the USA I thought the experience would be similar. It wasn't.The steaks were tough and overcooked and not to the standards found in the US. The service was nonchalant at best.
4
We got two nice and well prepared burgers, very juicy and with som nice crispy fries and Two nice drinks. We left with a smile and the service was good too
4
We went there after purchasing a Groupon voucher worth $120. We had a great time stuffing our faces with meat: ctab cakes, lamb chops and full portion of baby back ribs... Great food and nice atmosphere.
1
I tried to have a good beef and choose to go with my friends to this restaurant: was a BAD choice. Service is terrible, food is not comparable with the food that they serve in other Outbacks around the world. In summary was a disaster during and after dinner..
4
Although my order came up wrong it was quite quickly rectified, the food was very good and the staff were also goo
4
Unforgettable steak! Even the kids portion very good generous sizing!! Great service from Sujol :) will certainly be back :)
3
We had a family dinner for 4 with a groupon cash voucher for 120. Thought this would easily cover dinner mains. However these were overpriced for what we received. My sister had the steak and shrimp which was a 6 oz sirloin and 4 shrimp for $38. Dads main was $39 for 1/2 rack ribs, steak and fries. Both steaks were tougher than expected given the price. The ribs however were tasty. The redeeming factor was the extremely friendly service by the staff who were very accommodating throughout. It's a shame as given its meant to specialise in steaks one would expect these to have been tender Would go back for the cheaper lunch menu but would stick to having the ribs.
5
Awesome dinner, great service by Sujol who was really prompt with her service and really friendly. Love the steak and ribs and desserts. Was given some vouchers so definitely coming back again. :
5
It was my 2nd time to come here, the first being with friends and this time with my hubby for his birthday. Both times we were assisted by Sujol who was very kind, accommodating and friendly. Thumbs up for the really great service.She recommended prime rib char-grilled and portion was huge! My husband thoroughly enjoyed it---soft and cooked just as we requested.Will come back again soon!
4
Amazing service. Especially by staff Sojul, who didn't fail to attend to us promptly. There was a bit of delay when it came to the service for the food, due to the shortage of staff. However, Sojul managed to make our wait pleasant with her service.
5
Dinner was fantastic, great food and great service from Sujol! Especially loved the bushman shrooms and the warm bread they served before the meal. Service was prompt and attentive. Would come back again
4
Just visited Outback Steakhouse at Orchard gateway! Great service from Sujol and must try fried mushrooms! Should definitely try it if you are in town
5
They ran out of the Prime Rib, which was a bit disappointing but fortunately the ribs were good. Great service from Sujol
4
Visited the one at Millenia Walk - where you can sit in or out. Aircon very strong inside. Informal, pleasant, Australian food - fine, not amazing.Shared a spinach and artichoke dip for $14, then Barbie chicken breast for $20 and black pepper steak bites for $25. Offer on beer before 8 so one drink each. Overall bill with SC and GST was $101
4
I just visit singapore and 1st visit at outback, Ithe taste so unforgettable, the meat is soft and yummy, the service was good enough. really enjoy my trip at singapor
3
The waitress serving our table was Sujol and the service was good. Really appreciate it. Food was served efficiently. However, we had higher expectation for the quality of the food.

Real steakhouse (gateway) Grub! Loved the tastiest baby back ribs that melts in your mouth.. plus the servers (esp sojul & ruffy) were incredibly kind and accomodating serving you with a smile..
5
Delicious food and great service by fantastic crew Prasobha. I have not return for some times, She has changed my perception about this outlet.

we visited outback steakhouse at orchard gateway and the service was excellent. we were served by ms. prasobha. food was nice as well. definitely coming back. thanks.

Really enjoy my babyribs, tender and like the flavour. There's a complimentary bread roll, served warm is much appreciated. Their potato soup exceed my expectations too, thought it will be dull and plain like most add on soup. Instead there's bacon bites, cheese and others. Service here is even better than the food. Sujol who took care of our orders is the most pleasant service personale I have come across for a very long time. Thank you, Sujol ^.

My boyfriend and I were craving some meat so we decided to come into Outback Steakhouse. I haven't been here in awhile but the ribs I had were GREAT :D and the service staff were very friendly, especially Sujol who was very cheery and gave good suggestions on the steak :)
1
Love the Steak and ribs ! The service is quite good too:) excellent . Definitely will come again. Family friendly restaurant.
5
Great service, ambiance and food! For anyone looking for a great steak, outback is a must try! Special shout out to prasobha for his excellent service as well!

Had dinner with my friend at orchard gateway and we ordered the full slab baby back ribs and dessert duo. Meat falls right off the bones and dessert was superb. Server Suriya was excellent attending to our request and the serving of food is on time!
5
Had a wonder meal with my friend. Service is very great. We had baby back ribs. The meat easily fell off from the bone...yummy!!! Definetely coming back to this place!!
4
Delicious steaks and baby back ribs. Trust me, one full rack is enough for two full grown men! Excellent service from staff, especially Sujol!
4
The food was good but the service was even better thanks to sujol! The place is cozy.we were seated by the window so got a bit of view. Loved the burger.. Will definitely come back.
5
Cheers to Ms. Sujol for being helpful and attentive. She managed to satisfy our requests. Good Job! 😊
1
Mediocre and expensive. Flip your fries before they get burnt! Not worth visiting despite having groupon voucher.
3
Dark and unwelcoming atmosphere. Service was the worst I've experienced in some time. Steak was so tough it couldn't be chewed, hamburger meat tough as well. I would suggest one of the other hundreds of high quality restaurants in the area.
5
Food was great and these folks gave us a complementary candle cake to celebrate with family. Kids and adults both enjoyed the food and ambience.

Just went to The Orchard Gateway for my birthday lunch with my manager and colleagues and experienced the worst service ever. Your waiter spilled a whole glass of Coke on me! There was no service recovery at all! Your waiter just gave me some napkins for me to soak up the Coke and a change of table. Manager didn't came over, all other staff have no smile or empathy. I receive empathy from the group of customers seated beside us and gave me a wet tissue to clean up. Half of my pants was soaked with Coke! Nothing was done. Is this the usual Outback Steakhouse service standard and behaviour? I'm never going there again.
4
Ribeye steak was pretty worth it with a good portion of colesaw and aussie fries. Came here for a birthday celebration and the service rendered was beyond our expectation. Especially Joy sujol, one of orhard gateway's staff was attentive to our dining needs and even prepared a birthday cake for my friend whom we were here with. Great service even though food was mediocre.

We struggled to find restaurants in Singapore that we could trust to provide gluten free food. We chose to eat here after getting confident reassurances that simple chicken/salmon and veg dishes could be provided. We won't pretend this was the most amazing meal, but it was well cooked and more than adequate, but most importantly on this occasion, it was gluten free. No dessert options available though. Service was good and friendly
3
My go to restaurant when travelling in the U.S. not stellar but consistent you know what you are getting. That's not the case in Singapore, don't expect any specials just well worn menu, which is a cut down on the U.S. version and much less extensive. The choice of sides were poor and I have to say the steaks seem smaller, bread roll and butter is still the same. The restaurant is noisy, the service is so so. The cooking inconsistent. Coke comes in a tin so don't expect free refill's. Let's just say the franchise has not travelled well. Strange as it's not that far from the Aussie Outback as the U.S
3
Went there for the dinner for a special occasion. Had high hope as the price is a little bit more expensive than other steakhouse but found out it was just okay. The service was great though. Also ordered a red wine.
5
This branch Rox!! New Management madness the dining experience exceptional. Thanks Ethus and Boom! You made our day so memorable!! Kudos to you and your team. Will definitely come now often!!
4
Was here with some colleagues who after a week in Singapore were craving some western food (I took a curry) decent steaks and good service. Nice to have some authentic Australian beer such as VB on draught as well.
2
Dark like abandoned place. Hardly any lights. First feeling : why did I land up here. Service slow. Food : a pasta basically tasteless and you are forced to eat ! Asking myself : who is in the kitchen and is there anybody qualified to keep up the name "outback" !? Calamari : looked like a war ration , i.e very small, as to the calamari themselves it seemed that they had be soaking in cheap (smelly) oil with the "crust" (actually no crust) which seemed like breadcrumbs so soaked that it disintegrate in your plate! Pathetic. Spareribs , very so so (on the dry side). A poor very poor salad unappetising !.A big hard burger ... definitely not you expect to find in Outback ! Pricewise for the quality of food served is a rip off. Last time there
2
I like Outback and have been to a good few in the US so was happy to see the sign for this one. Menu fairly similar but without the included salad but that's ok. Unfortunately that's the good news. Ordered, wings, steak, sides of corn on cob and baked potato not loaded just with butter.Still waiting for the wings so can't comment on them! Steak was cooked as ordered but if this is their local 'signature steak' they need to change their name. Tough and just poor quality. Potato arrived loaded not just butter. The corn on the cob was so over cooked it was a horrible (microwaved as well?) almost mushy texture. The pepper sauce on the side was the strangest I've seen. Wish someone had returned and asked if I liked my meal but no. So if I were you I would avoid as Singapore has so many amazing places to eat and this one needs to get back to drawing board if it's to survive
5
More than the quality and sumptuous food was the welcoming and accommodating service rendered specially Ms. Sujol. Imagine a crowd of friends who just reunited after more than a decade, with so many demands. Outback's Ms. Sujol handled us well with grace and excellence. Will definitely come back for the food and service.
3
Food is normal. The onion blossom is super salty and it's in onion rings kind instead of long chips kind. Staff is not friendly. They just go about doing their business, you call them to refill water then they come. For the price, the food is not worth it
3
I went to the Millenia Walk outlet on a Friday evening for my hubby's birthday celebration after seeing the promotion on a union Facebook page. There is a 1 for 1 sirloin 6oz steak promotion. There is also 15% off total bill and a free dessert for union member on the birthday month. Millenia Walk is normally not crowded. However, there was not enough staff serving and the service was not that good initially.The sirloin steak cost S$28.90++. 1 for 1 is worth it. However, the steak was hard even though it was medium cooked. The food was only ok. The iced tea at S$4.90 was refillable. I requested for warm water and it's free. The bread was warm and very tasty. That's the nicest food of that dinner. The pecan brownie was nice but the warm chocolate was too sweet. And there was a big scoop of whipped cream on top of the yellowish vanilla ice cream.When I requested for my free dessert (which was the pecan brownie), they informed that if I ordered the 1 for 1, I cannot get the 15% discount and the free dessert. I showed them the union Facebook post which didn't indicate that. The manager was nice to offer the free dessert out of goodwill although he was not very friendly initially. However, I do appreciate their offer as they also want to make sure we are happy. Overall, it is a place with ok food and affordable price. Service is ok. Big place for group outings too. And a place if you love beer or cocktails. If not, there are only soft drinks, coffee and tea. Hence, I asked for water.

Conviently located in Orchard Gateway is outback steakhouse. We arrived at 9pm on a weekday and the dining room was pretty much empty. The staff were still very cheerful and friendly.Based on their menu, it seems to have pretty much the same stuff you would find at any Outback in other countries.Outback Steakhouse is a steakhouse concept with more than 1,000 locations spanning 22 countries. Established in Tampa, Florida in 1988, each restaurant is a friendly, casual and relaxing place embodying the spirit of the Australian Outback with bold flavorful food.Outback takes great pride in serving the freshest, highest-quality food. I remember having some good memories with their grilled seafood, steak and blooming onions!The dining area is mainly made up of booths.1. Typhoon Bloom $14.90++For an appetizer, you cannot go wrong with the Typhoon Bloom for all onion ring lovers. It is no blooming onion, and to be honest. It looks like alot less effort went into this compared to a blooming onion. It is a hand-cut, fresh onion, dusted with Outback's own secret seasonings, stacked high and cooked until golden. The sauce provided in the center is their spicy signature bloom sauce. It's kind of tangy and I liked the creaminess of the sauce. I felt like the onion was fried abit too much and hence it was slightly on the dry side but other than that. It met my expectation of massive fried onion!2. Sirlion and Baby Back Ribs $39.90++This is a 6oz. siganture USDA sirloin paire with half a rack of smoked baby back ribs served with aussie thick cut fries. It is an okay portion for just one pax. But the juiciness of the steak justifies the pricing.medium steakThs ribs were also tender and though it didn't quite fall of the bones. It was tender enough for me to consider whether or not it was completely fresh, or fresh-frozen. Either ways, for $40++ you are getting a decent dinner.3. Toowomba Chicken $24.90++Sauteed shrimp and buttom mushrooms, tossed in a tomato cream sauce and served over grilled chicken. The shrimp and the mushrooms were delicious. I wish I could've asked a top up of a side of shrimp for this! The vegetables were steamed and had the right texture. I felt that the chicken was on the dry side and I didn't quite enjoy it. The tomato cream sauce, helped make the dry chicken slightly more bearable
3
Went here with a group of us. Staff were very friendly, but service was a little slow. Food was good though. This is not a high end restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, but perfectly good and in Singapore terms, quite reasonable, if you are a meat eater. If you aren't you may struggle
3
Soup of the day was very good!
House salad was very good too!
However I did not like the taste of the Kookaburra Wings.
The ribs was only average but the chicken breast was tender. We were served by Josephine.
3
Good food, average atmosphere. Pretty run of the mill, but not a bad price and the beef was good. Great place to grab a quick meal on the way to the F1 track.
5
Great steak for 4 deal at the present time and reasonably priced. Drinks as normal rather expensive which adds to the bill.
4
we r attended by Sujol at Orchard Gateway.
Shes smiley, friendly and has extended us an excellent service.
Great cosy environment for dining.
thank u Sujol
5
I after a day of sightseeing, I was looking for a familiar place to dine, so I stopped at Outback Steakhouse for dinner. The restaurant was quite crowded, but they managed to get a booth seat for me and my wife upon request. Food was great, and service was excellent. I was served by Zach, a polite young chap who spoke without a trace of a Singaporean accent. (That really impressed me!) The bill was a little pricey, but I can say it was worth it. Thanks for the lovely dinner.

Our last night in Singapore and was asked by my husband, where did I want to eat. A lovely steak at Outbacks...yes please! But....oh what a disappointment was in store. Started off ok with their now famous Typhoon Bloom(battered onion with dip) which could have fed at least 4 people. Enjoyed that, very much. However, it was downhill from then on. My Outback special Signature steak (cooked medium) was as tough and as chewy as old boots!!!! Asked if everything was OK, I replied no and expressed my feelings, to which the reply was, I'll ask the chef to cook it some more as if that was going to rectify the problem. I asked the waiter to take it back to the chef to see what his response would be. He reappeared 2 mins later with a bowl of soup and said they were cooking me another steak. I politely refused the soup.. Just how much did he think I could eat!!!!The 2nd steak arrived...but just as tough!!!!Unfortunately my meal had been ruined, but the manager did adjust the bill accordingly. A great disappointment to what had been, up until then, a wonderful holiday
4
Visited the orchard gateway outlet!We enjoyed our steaks, ribeye and sirloin, plus the artichoke spinach dips with tortilla chips! Sujol was a great waitress to our table and we enjoyed her service
5
Sometimes, after months in SE Asia, it's nice to just have a great steak,salad and potato. Yayat Sudrajat, managing partner, made sure we had a great meal with wonderful people to talk to about our travels in the area.With Singapore dining prices quite high, this is a great place for good food at reasonable prices. Thanks, Yayat, for taking good care of us
5
It my first time come to this branch in orchard gateway. Nearest mrt station is sommerset. It's located at orchard road. I am here for dinner and I ordered a full slab of baby back ribs serve with fries and my favorite deep fried mushrooms. I am happy with my meal. The ribs are well marinated and grill to perfection, meat are really tender and tasty. Fried mushroom with the ranch sauce is heavenly goo. Will come back again!!
2
Doesn't look like half a rack to me... Must have been a mini-pig. Couldn't have gotten as much as a palm-full of meat off the whole lot. Some fries came almost raw. Flavors were right, especially the rib BBQ sauce, but my wife's black pepper steak bites were tough and gristly.Was a bit homesick and this looked like a good option.... but I guess Outback doesn't translate to Asia very well
1
The title of this tells it all. How any self respecting restaurant could sell this and hope to get away with it astounds me. Its fraud. I ordered a medium done ribeye with pepper sauce and when it arrived [with cold pepper sauce] my jaw dropped at the amount of fat. My complaint was well received by the manager [Mr Faz] who didn't charge me for the steak and for that I am thankful to him as i was visibly upset. Whilst a bouquet goes to Mr Faz a bucket goes to the restaurant. I wont be back
3
My second time giving a shot at Outback Steakhouse. My friend called and made a reservation on the phone the previous day however on the day when we turned up, there wasn't any reservations made! Luckily there were still seats available. Ordered Medium well for my steak however it was still kind of raw to my liking.. Still taste alright though for those not too particular about the doneness. Try the cheese fries! Service staff whom I believe is a Vietnamese waiter was commendable, he's very attentive to us. Good place for gathering with friends/family right in town.
5
Being an Aussie had to try this place. I had the Alice Springs quesida (well 1/2 of one) and some swet potato fries. Both were delivered promptly and hot. Found the portion sizes were large and the amount I had was still too much for me. Followed this up with a Singapore Sling. Went home feeling full but not overly stuffed. Would recommend to travellers. Dining partner had the ribs which also looked beautifully tender
5
As always, outback steakhouse at millenia walk never fails to amaze me on their excellent food and superb service!:)
5
As always, outback steakhouse is my favorite go to steak restaurant. I ordered the ribeye steak, as always it tastes great and delicious! I also want to commend the good service and hospitality of the staff especially the manager Gab for checking if I like the food or if the steak is cooked to my liking.I highly recommend this restaurant to steak lovers
5
Food was good and excellent service. We enjoyed the pleasant service from our waitress shasha. we would highly recommend the Outback Steakhouse in Singapore.
5
the outback at Millenia Walk was a delight. Consistent quality of food that you expect from outback with a friendly staff and exceptional service. Nisha behind the bar was especially helpful and friendly. They have a great two-for-one happy during the week
5
WE had another nice meal at the outback in Singapore after a similar experience in Hong Kong. Good service and very pleasant, helpful staff. Pity we don't have any in Leeds West YOYorkshire
5
The lunch set is very affordable...Service is excellent. I ordered for Half Baby Back Ribs and got it the way I way I wanted it in less time. Food is great.The staff and duty manager are very hospitable and always checking on us.I highly recommend this steak house. All the best :-
1
The presentation and quality of the food looked terrible, a Big Mac looked way better than the burger I ordered. For the steak dish, the carrots were super hard to bite. We even had to remind the staff they forgot the bread which came after the main.Waited for about 10 mins when asking for condiments or cutlery.When finally asking for the bill the staff just nods and walks away, 10 minutes later after reminding still nods and walks away. Had to ask another staff which then printed the bill immediately
5
Prompt and excellent service. The store manager stopped by our table a few times to check whether how we are doing. Quality of food is decent and simple yet comfortable ambiance. Worth a visit.
5
Excellent service was provided & quality food was being served. It also house a perfect setup for a meal with friends & family.
5
My friends and I enjoyed ourselves!
They serve real quality beef and their customer services are amazing.
Will go back again!

We used to frequent hogs breath steak house for our steak fix but since it's closure we have been looking alternative. We decide to try out outback. The food is mediocre. Sirloin steak was tough and dry. And the doneness was mixed up. We ordered medium rare but the steak came out almost well done. The server (Rahu? - we got his name from his colleague) was rude and unhelpful and has difficulties understanding simple English. He brushed aside all our complaints and tried to ignore us for the rest of the night. That's just absurd. Totally won't recommend this place.
5
I had goot time in outback in Singapore! Meal wad tasty and every staffs were so kind!!!! Especially my drink was so good !!! Before caming Singapore i wanted Singaporean alcohol, and then i tryed in outback!!!! So delicious! Thanks for everything:))) By Japanese outback staff!
5
I stepped away at one point to use the toilet, thinking that leaving my hat would signal that I'd return shortly. When I got back I found that my half eaten meal had been cleared from the table. Before I even had a moment to register what had happened the manager rushed over and profusely apologized, offering to replace the meal. I thought it was a pretty funny scenario but took him up on the offer. They bent over backwards to correct the error. Really appreciated the quick response
3
For more than a decade my family has been going to this franchise, in the U.S., Brazil, Korea and Singapore. Everywhere the food is ok, nothing astonishing, but fairly reliable. Unfortunately here in Singapore they decided to remove what I consider their most unusual item on the menu, the Blooming Onion. That's what deferentiates Outback from other similar franchises, such as Tony Roma's and Chili's, and it's no wonder why they have been loosing ground in Singapore. For my family, they lost their appeal totally, until they decide to bring back the Blooming Onion. Their service is all right, but the overall quality of their steaks could be improved and the vegetables should be less cooked in general
1
A dinner characterised my mistakes and poor quality. Wrongly cooked steaks, missed orders, over cooked veg, under cooked burgers. Hardly hit anything right. I should have credit that they offered us the meal for free given the number of issues, so perhaps we were an exception. But on the experience.....dreadful
4
It is outback steakhouse but the steakhouse in orchard gateway, right off orchard road, is well located and has friendly staff.Its family friendly and for the prices, no real complains. If you are in the mood for a steak and if you are not in the mood for prices charge by Morton's then this is a decent place. I was served by Anandhu who was very friendly without being in your face.No real complains to be honest. Sirloin steak for USD 25 in Singapore...its not too shabby
4
Had the baby back ribs & Alice Springs chicken.The chicken was good but the ribs were simply melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious.My wife loved her Toowoomba chicken.The portions were just right - didn't have room for dessert.Great value.The service staff were very attentive and friendly.MC, in particular, made us feel welcome and made sure we got what we needed and took care of our special requests. We are definitely going back for more
5
Nice place to hang out - nice ambiance! We loved the Towoomba Pasta and the luscious dessert- chocolate thunder from down under! The Staff were very accommodating-especially KC! Looking forward on our next visit.
5
(KC) is my server this afternoon and she assist me in a pleasant one. The food was great and service on time. Very good service and food.
5
Nice place to hang out with great food to go. Service was excellent with warm and very attentive servers, notably MC.
5
The food was so so good, I was full but kept on eating, no kidding, must try it out you guys. Service from KC was truly an pleasant one, I enjoyed having my date in this restaurant overall. I would definitely come back again.
4
The food is tasty and the service is great especially from the server Anandhu........................................................................................................................................ I will definitely visit again.
5
Wifey and I had a very good dinner at this resto. Great food with great service. Will definitely be back for more meaty goodness! Highly recommended!
5
MC my server is warm and attentive and offers great service. The steak is awesome, great attention to the cooking and great taste as a result.
5
the food was good, and the service was awesome! Service staff (Kaycee) was very organized taking my orders and was very polite. My order was served on time and the steaks were rightly cooked. Best steak experienced ever!
5
We love Outback in general, but tonight we were celebrating a birthday and the birthday "girl" loves steak, so Outback at Orchard Gateway was the natural choice. Everyone ordered the Victoria fillet, so I can't review other steaks, but everyone loved their steak and the sides (sweet potatoes, veggies, salads). The steaks were cooked perfectly. Afterwards we ordered two desserts, Carrot Cake and Chocolate Thunder Down Under. Truly delicious.Our waitress was KC. Wonderful, friendly service! I gave her a big tip
4
The food we ordered did not take too long to be prepared and served to us. The portion of food was satisfactory, and they tasted really good as well. Service staff (MC) was very friendly to my family and I. From the moment we stepped in and got seated to the moment we left the restaurant, she displayed great hospitality. Although there were other diners in the restaurant at that time, she rendered first-class service that was seemingly personalized for us. She repeatedly returned to our table and asked if we needed anything else and solicited our feedback with regards to the quality of the food
4
the food was good. the service staff (anandhu) was very polite and attentive in our needs. the food was delivered on time. the steaks were rightly cooked. its just the dressing of the salad was a bit salty. other than that it was awesome.
5
The resto at orchard gateway is very nice and clean. Ms. Karen our server is polite and attentive. Nice place to visit if your are in singapore. Very good experience for me and my husband to dine in👍🏼😊
5
Cozy place. Tasty food. Great service and friendly staff esp to Seethal. Thank you. Two thumbs up! A must try steakhouse!
5
Came across this restaurant and had to dine. Always enjoy meals at Outback Steakhouses! This one didn't disappoint! Quick service and friendly staff. Our meal was delicious.
4
Good view and foods, nice service, especially from lovely Sujol. Recommended place. Good cocktails as well. Got great nice with my gf here.
4
A laid-back Sunday lunch amongst friends with great service to top it off, particularly by a waitress named Sujol. Stay classy!
5
Family and I had a great time as our server Rinku has the best attitude and service rendered to us. Always having a smile and great attitude!
5
We loved our visit! Food never fails to disappoint and servers are beyond friendly! Highly recommend this place especially if you're hungry!!
5
Execellent food and ambience. The service given by Mr. Syam is very good as he is very attentive. For example, he will automatically asked to refill our waters or take away the unwanted plates. The BBQ pulled pork fries is delicious too and it is worth the value
5
this place is perfect as it is conveniently located in orchard gateway. the food was extremely delectable and served beautifully. i loved the ribs and chicken combo -- the ribs were cooked perfectly and the chicken was seasoned well.our server Sujol was also very helpful in recommending the specialty of the house and in making sure our dining experience was impeccable. we would surely visit again
5
Orchard gateway branch
Service was superb and everyone was friendly. Food was great.
We will visit again!
5
Great service from Sujol, attentive and accommodating! She helped us with all our requests with great patience and a great smile. Will patronize again. Dessert was really good!
5
Very nice steak and pork ribs, like their pasta sweetest staff Sujol helped us on the order, the combo set of ribs and steak got everthing worth to try, at orchard gateway
5
We have been an avid customer of Outback Steakhouse Orchard Gateway since it opened. The steak is deliciously tender and flavorful. The quesadilla is to die for. And there's something with their free bread and butter that's very addictive. We were attended by Sujol today. She was very knowledgeable and attentive. Excellent service and food
4
We had the Prime Rib recommended by Sujol at orchard gateway! It was good! Although abit salty and 1/3 of prime rib was Fats. Outback special was decent but nothing to raved about. The pasta was a big portion and it was yummy. Overall, a pleasant experience
5
The food taste great! pull pork fries is outstanding! steak is as usual awesome and we were served by the attentive and cheerful Sujol. she saw us using our own tissues and brought us some serviettes. refilling our drink when we need. Thank you and We will definitely be back again

We had previously been to Outback Steakhouse in Las Vegas and had an amazing time so we couldn't wait to go again whilst in Singapore. We booked for the restaurant on Raffles Boulevard for the six of us. When our meals arrived, my husband first complained as his chips were burnt and black, then two more meals were cold and had to be returned, two of the other meals weren't very hot but they decided to persevere and eat it anyway. My husbands meal was returned minus the chips as they were cooking more, but he had finished his steak by the time they were bought to the table. The other two meals arrived about 40 minutes later, after everyone else had finished, and weren't much better than the first. The waiting on staff couldn't apologize enough and two are of our meals were taken off our bill, but have never been so disappointed
2
I been in many Outback Steakhouse outside Singapore and this one was the worse steak i ever have.The steak not have any flavour at all, 50% meat is fat, poor cut. Also the mash potato tasteless. The service is good. The entree i order was very good, the quesadilla and the buffalo wings. But its a Steakhouse and should have the best steak, but not
2
Service is clumsy and trying too much to look professional while being incapable of being such. Dishes coming in different times, cold, confusion...Steak was good, salads too. Mashed potatoes (side) was horrible. Probably the worst I had.Deserts were fine. If it wasn't for the coupons they keep having not sure I would go there again. For the same price you can find much better selection around. Much better.
5
The service here is heart warming. My friend and I wanted a quiet spot for a late dinner for some girl's talk.the tables were full when I arrived and I was placed at a cramped spot. I requested for a change when a bigger table freed up. The service crew at gateway orchard, Anisha, very readily accommodated with a warm smile. And thoughtfully moved us to a quiet table.A great establishment is not just about good food but also about service that touches the heart. She made our girls talk night special. And I am sure the food will be great as I tuck into them right now

Such an awesome dinner! Food was great! Thanks karen #greatsteak #ilovesteak # welovefood

Friendly service, really good food and steaks are cooked perfectly, would recommend this restaurant at Mellenia Walk Singapore.😊

Great food, great place to spend with your friends and approachable staff,will definitely come back. Love the alice springs chicken quesadilla.
5
Sunday 19th July went to this place to have lunch. the service was so good.. the waitress was so polite and friendly.. this people train their staff very well.. keep it up Guys.. will visit back...

This is not a first time visiting Singapore. We use to stay in different hotel here. This time we stay at Conrad Hotel. We didn't know if there is steakhouse restaurant just next to the hotel. We all four had dinner here. Surprisingly the food were awesome, especially ribeye steak; juicy and tender (I choose baked potato and seasonal vegetables for side).My son and daughter both had kid ribs. As my wife just had a glass of soda. Waiter is very polite,helpful and regularly check our table to ensures everything are good. Never miss out things even for refilling drinks. Highly recommended!
3
Been here a few times over the years for lunch and dinner and recently came back again. The quality seems to be a little hit and miss here for some reason. When the restaurant has more guests the steak actually seems better - maybe they have the grill on full time and cooks better.....
5
We found out about Outback Steakhouse via a food review site. The waitress, Sujol, attended to us immediately when we settled down, she was extremely helpful and attentive to us, giving us helpful recommendations when we asked for it. The food was excellent and wonderful, it came promptly and was really good, the food gives you the bang for your buck and is really worth the price. Overall, a wonderful experience at the orchard gateway outlet, 10/10. Highly recommended! Special mention to our waitress Sujol, who provided extremely good service for us
2
I wanted to order a steak, which was 38 dollars, I didn't want the sides offered but asked if I could have a side salad - only if i paid 10 bucks extra? I asked if I could have pepper sauce instead of one of the sides - no I would have to pay for this too, but I can have the sides for free that I didn't want.Rubbish - walked ou
3
Went to the orchard gateway outlet since this was the nearest & was craving for steak. Place was situated with a great view but lunch crowd was so so. Well, not all food is lousy... but I did see a tiny insect on the table moving around. In any case - I loved the bread and their sweet baked potato... but their steak was not that good in my opinion (Lunch menu - outback special)
1
The food here is of a very low quality. I had a burger which was tasteless and awful 'Australian style' chips. I didn't even realise Australian style chips existed, but coming from Australia I can assure you they don't usually taste like this! My daughter had fish and chips. The fish was ok, but again it was served with those awful chips.Drinks were ok but my cocktail took such a long time to arrive. I was nearly finished my meal.Service was terrible. Don't eat here

Went for lunch....lunch menu not available. Had to order from more expensive dinner menu!!! No reason given. Hubby ordered burger from dinner menu, was then told it wasn't available. Drinks ok, food only so-so. Used to be a favourite place to visit in Singers - not anymor

Everything we asked for, we have to ask for two times or more because nothing comes. We came here with my wife's family to celebrate my birthday but it was such a disappointment. The typhoon bloom was pathetic for the price we paid, $15 for a small onion, and the steaks were really substandard, too salty and it was just done badly. The only consolation was that I got a birthday dessert, but we were really disappointed with the service, not what we expected paying several hundred dollars at a restaurant

What sort of bare faced cheek does it take to charge such prices for such food? Tasteless, meanly proportioned full of inedible disgusting gobbets of fat and gristle (NOT marbling) slapped on an empty plate with a joke of a Caesar salad plonked next to it by staff flummoxed by a request for Coke Zero (an equivalent would've done) as distinct from ordinary Coke (the Coke Zero was eventually produced after consultation with a senior staff member)? It's hard to resist the urge to use expletives. An absolute disgrace.

Our son wanted a good steak so we gave it a go. Have to say we were very impressed. The meals were fantastic and the service impeccable and it is also very well priced. We were a little full after our main meals, but wanted to give dessert a go and were surprised when the waiter told us we could order small serves. The dessert was yummy. It was a little hard to find, but so worth it. If we get time we will be going back before we leave Singapore

Good food, friendly service rendered at Outback! Went with boyfriend, and we ordered bushrooms, steak, prime rib 10 oz and chocolate thunder! Am glad to say that the food tasted awesome especially the bushrooms and steak! My boyfriend loves the chocolate thunder!! Overall definitely worthy for a second visit as the food as well as service was great
1
We arrived here right on time for our booking. Ordered 2 steak bites as well as typhoon burger as main. Also ordered typhoon bloom as appetizer. The food was lousy. There was a non existent service even though it is Monday evening and the restaurant is not even half full. Singapore has much better eateries and I would recommend to stay away from this place.

We love almost everything about outback steakhouse. From the starters to the mains to the desserts and the drinks, outback is sure to please. I would recommend the duo starters of wings and calamari (or onion bloom) and any of the steak is good too. The Alice Springs chicken is also a favourite along with the 'chocolate thunder from down under' to complete your meal. The Gold Coast Rita (Margarita) would quench any thirst and one is usually not enough. If consistency is what you're looking for, outback never disappoints. It used to be very crowded but if you come as a couple, you should be seated fairly quickly. Sign up as a member for more good deals. I know this sounds like an advertisement but it really isn't. It is really that good.

I ate at Outback Steakhouse( Gateway)many times because of very good food, service' ambiance and central location of this restaurant. I never fail to order mushroom soup. It is the best In town and credit goes to the chef who cooks it. However, it would be better if it could be served really hot instead of warm. It would enhance the already thick and creamy taste. The other dish I like ordering when I visit is Ribs and chicken combo. The ribs are juicy and best not charred....good for people like me who is health-conscious. It goes very well with the sauce that comes with it. For improvement, Outback may wish to replace chicken breast with chicken thigh. Breast meat is tough to eat while chicken thigh is tender. The portion for ribs and chicken combo used to be generous for the past 5 times I was there until last night. The portion had shrank considerably for ribs, chicken and fries. Though the food tasted very good, I, somehow, felt shortchanged and a bit disappointed. I hope it was only a one-time off mistake in portioning the food otherwise customers wouldhave to look elsewhere for better food value. Having said that, I always enjoy eating at Outback, Gateway

More like a really bad fast food restaurant. Reserve signs on tables, but no people coming in. Food awful. Don't go there

The best steak I eat in Singapore.
Overall, food and service were great.
Great value for money.
Excellent dessert: Chocolate Thunder !
We'll be back next time I'm in town.
2
This meal was terrible, the meat was chewy (a steakhouse should know how to present meat). The staff were a bit over the place, not knowing what was going on. The one thing they had going for them was the staff all wanted to be helpful but it seemed like they weren't trained properly
4
I read the reviews for thei place only after I ate there, and good thing I did. I ate twice at the Raffles/Millenia branch during my week's stay in town, that says something by itself, doesn't it? Both times enjoyed the versatile menu, generous portions and value for money. Service was ok, not hi-end but it is expected with the affordable prices, and given the young age of the waiters. Would recommend the baby ribs, as well as the signature salads. Friends said the Typhoon Burger was also a hit. Thumbs up
4
We ate at the Outback in the Millenia Walk shopping center and had a very nice meal. We used a Groupon and the meal came out perfect and we had great service. This is not a busy shopping center so there were plenty of available tables at dinner time. This is not on the must see/eat at list but if you are in the area I suggest you stop by

If you are a steak lover, you will already know about The Outback - the largest steakhouse chain in the world. You might not expect to find it in Singapore, though. Coming from Indonesia, we didn’t and were delighted to discover The Outback’s new outlet at Orchard Gateway, opposite Centerpoint on Orchard Road. The greatest difficulty we had at The Outback was simply choosing what to have. The menu is filled with delicious appetizers, main courses, desserts, and beverages. We were hankering for steaks, so chose the signature Outback Special Sirloin with three steak sizes and five degrees of doneness to choose from. Another time we’ll try the ribeye, prime ribs, New York Strip or a steak and ribs combo. Of course you don’t have to choose beef at The Outback. There are lots of other main courses, including chicken, pork chops, grilled salmon, and seafood pasta.Our meal came with a small loaf of tasty brown bread and fresh butter, served on its own cutting board, as well as two side dishes. There were nine side dishes in all to choose from. In addition to fresh veggies, I took the baked potato with sour cream and chives. If you are tired of baked or mashed potatoes, though, try corn on the cob, Aussie fries, rice pilaf, sweet potato fries, or sweet baked potato with honey butter and cinnamon sugar. As for drinks, we enjoyed Aussie red wine with our steaks, but there were also many kinds of cocktails to choose from made from fresh fruits and juices. If the whole family is along, be sure to ask for the Kid’s Menu.We appreciated the comfortable venue of The Outback as well as the quick and friendly service. If you love steaks and hearty eating, try The Outback at Orchard Gateway

We went for lunch and i had this big urge for a good steak. My wife had the pork ribs and it was very good. Not drowned in BBQ sauce and done just right. I had not had a proper steak for weeks and this one hit the spot just right. Next time you have that urge, go to Outback and you will not be disappointed by the food or the service
3
Having eaten in a number of their restaurants in other parts of the world mainly the USA, I was really looking forward to this, unfortunately by comparison the food was only OK. The menu was similar to other restaurants but neither the steak or ribs were as good as I've had else where. Service was good and attentive and the atmosphere was fine, just the food not as tasty as I've grown to expect from Outback Steak House
4
We like Outback in the US, we like steak and we like Australia ... so the Outback near Suntech City was an easy choice for jetlagged travellers. Service was a little slow but the food was tasty and the beer was cold. Just what the flying doctor ordered
4
Been to a couple other Outback when we are in the States, service is always excellent and the staff is attentive and responsive.. We walked past the outlet at Orchard Gateway and decided to have our dinner there and wanted to have the bloomin onion but there wasn't any in Singapore, we settled for the alternative instead. Not a deal breaker.Service was phenomenal here and overall everything was good. We will be back for sure

I frequented this restaurant when I first moved from Melbourne to Singapore. The steaks were delicious and the chicken and mushroom dish was delightful. However, something happened to this place. Perhaps a change in management. It was down hill from then on...Here's a description of the most recent few times I've been there (the latest being 2-3 weeks ago in Feb 2015):1. The quality of steaks have significantly deteriorated. I believe they used to serve Aussie beef but now, it feels like they opted for the bull. Meat is tough as and served in the in an under-sized plate as though the restaurant couldn't afford a proper plate. For the quality of food, the prices charged are definitely not worth it. And that's why they keep having promotions on Groupon. 2. What ticked me off in the most recent trip was the dishonesty of the restaurant staff including the manager. They had a big sign on the outside that kids eat free on weekends and we definitely visited on the weekend. I double checked before ordering to find out what "the promotion" was and I was told that "you get one kids meal free for every main meal ordered". When the bill came, we got charged for 2 mains and 2 kids meals so I politely asked why were the kids' meals on the bill. The waitress came back after knocking off one of the kids meals so I said that's not what we were told. She went to check with the manager and returned saying that's what the manager understands it to be as well. I stood firm and said that's not what we were told and we specifically confirmed prior to ordering. The waitress then reluctantly took the bill back and fixed it up. It's not about the 15 bucks or so but the deceitful attitude of the staff and manager at this restaurant that ticks me off. It's either that they were so poorly trained and misinformed that they weren't aware of what was supposed to be on offer (bread and butter of customer service I thought) OR that there was never and intent to offer the free meals to begin with. Either way, I'm never going back there and I won't be recommending this place to anyone I know either

Chicken roasted was terrible. Chicken burger had piece chicken that was twice the size of my thumb. Wings was okay. Overall could not wait to get out from there. This was the new branch at Orchard gateway. Service was professional. I did mention at end that food was not food. It was closing time and they offered a 10$ voucher per person. In fact the manager came running to us to hand the vouchers as we walked away. Was tempted to use vouchers cos it was alot of money. But could not force myself for another visit. Damage was done. And I was not able to convince anyone else to use the vouchers. Sorry outback. You've got too much to improve. All in all the poor food is partly offset by good service and setting. Three star is a big reward.

Four of us went for a meal and were disappointed. We've been to the outback in Orlando and were expecting something as good as that, it wasn't. The meal was just average, the only saving grace was the Singapore Slings.
2
The food was very high cost being near the Conrad hotel - and the quality was very low in comparison. The steak was very tough, the vegetable portions very small and the overall cleanliness of the tables was disappointing. I am not sure I would recommend this place unless you are starving

I've always loved my meals at Outback Steakhouse @ Millennia so when my partner suggested to give the Orchard Gateway branch a shot last Friday, I happily agreed. A decision I swiftly regretted in the next hour. We ordered the 1/2 Ribs + Striploin combo and Ribeye Steak. Both medium rare.First, my Ribeye came to me extremely rare. It was barely seared on the outside and the inside was so raw, it had that unappetising raw meat taste. Mind you, I am not talking about the slight gamey taste of beef, that I actually really love. This was butcher-grade raw I'm talking about. Plus, there were hardly any grill marks on the meat, which meant the piece lacked that chargrilled flavour I enjoy. Of course I had to send it back for it to be cooked further. And just as expected, it came back more medium-well than the medium-rare I had ordered.Next, nevermind the skinny and dry ribs on my partner's plate. His cut of beef, the striploin, came in an unusually cylindrical portion, instead of a flat piece. Not only did it lack flavour, it was slightly more rare than medium rare, the meat was so tough it was a constant battle with the knife to get it cut into bite-sized portions. And when you put it into your mouth, the chewy, tough cut became war for the jaw. So much so that my partner lost the will to finish his food.The bill came up to $100+ and needless to say, that wasn't money well spent. Shocking on all accounts that this is the standard we were presented. You'd think that for a steakhouse, you can be assured they know their meats and how to cook them. To get all this wrong is as rookie as it gets and enough to make me never want to return. For the same amount of money, I can get better steaks at Black Swan, which though is not a steak expert, presents exceptional juicy, tender and flavorful portions. Heck, even the grumpy servers at Shashlik or pedestrian standards of Jack's Place beat this hands down any day. The Australians would be so ashamed. Can somebody bring back Hog's Breath please

We ate our first meal here after arriving in Singapore in the early evening, tired and hungry and not being sure about what the local area offered. The restaurant was very busy but we were seated promptly. We both ordered burgers and they took a while to arrive. However, we were very impressed when the waitress brought us two complimentary soups as an apology for the delay. The burgers were tasty and we enjoyed them. My partner was pleased that he received two beers for the price of one, too! Overall, we were pleased with both the food and service we received at this restaurant
2
During our stay in Singapore we eat at this restaurant on two occasions.On the first occasion my advised the staff member clearly she required her steak to be cooked Well Done, meaning no blood or pink. The waitress said she understood exactly how my wife wanted her steak.The steak was served very pink and uneatable for my wife.They offered to take back both steaks but when mine was returned you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.At the end of our meal we were offered a free desert of chocolate cake and ice cream we figured they couldn't wrong.The following night we gave then a second chance, what a silly move that was, similar to the night before.The restaurant doesn't have it own toilets so you walk into the shopping centre to go to the toilet.Quality of steak poorI would be happier at Hungry Jacks.There are much better options close by
2
Came here for lunch today (Millenia Walk) with a colleague. I chose the steak set whilst she had the fish masala. My steak was really very disappointing: very chewy almost to the point of being inedible. The soup as a starter was too salty and really not so satisfying. Overall cost was about $45 SGD. I doubt I'll return

Guess what for Christmas' Eve dinner? Outback steak! We were looking for something that two people could share. The staff recommended us the prime rib that came with two appetizers.Their bread always tasted so yummy every time I visit, especially it came with the creamy butter. The baked potato with the sour cream was superb. We literally wanted to eat the whole thing including the skin. My husband is a big fan of beef, the choice of prime rib absolutely made him a happiest person that evening. It was so tender and flavorful! I was told they actually cooked it for hours.Fried calamari and baked sweet potato were just nice. The only part which I think they need to improve was the fried chicken wings. The wings were a bit over cooked so they turned dark brown. It can be a little bit more tender. The staff there were very friendly in Outback Steakhouse Orchard Gateway, especially our waiter who was quite knowledgeable to guide us to order the right food and the right portion for us. They seems to have strong manpower there to get ready serves and meet customers need at most time.Happy Christmas Eve with great food, great service in new branch and new mall

I had a huge expectations for the foods, ordered the New York one, 10oz and Medium well. Well the service was average, lot of choice of drinks, but unfortunately, my steak was overcook and it got wrong side dish too. With that price it should be bette

Located at Millemia Walk, and a favorite steakhouse around for more than a decade, we are once again brought back here as a reminder, and refresher of good steaks by Outback Steakhouse. An authentic American steakhouse featuring comfortable big vinyl booth seats as well as a bar counter for patrons to enjoy a hearty meal and drinks - Outback Steakhouse practices strict quality control / standardisation of its branding and food across the globe. Hence, the sauce sauce and recipes are all from the HQ in the States, and all changes / improvisions to the menus have to be approved by the HQ as well.We tried the Bloomin' Onion aka Onion Rings (SGD$14.50) and it is a huge portion, all stacked nicely with spicy dip atop. The onion rings are crumbly outside, thinly coated so that one could really taste the crunchiness of the fresh onions within. A couple of us thought that the onion rings (without even the dip) were a tad too salty.The Chicken Cobb Salad was served next - a large platter of lettuce, chicken, hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, Cheddar and Monterey Jack slices and bacon etc. It was delicious, a little like Caesar Salad with Chicken, and is served with blue cheese sauce on the side as well. The fresh greens were definitely very welcoming in this meaty feast tonight.We enjoyed the Ribeye Steak (SGD$37.90) which was well-marbled, juicy - it was also seasoned and seared in their 17-spices blend. We were served the Medium Rare steak and the Medium Well one, but opted for the former because it was more succulent. I did enjoy the fine texture and exotic flavor of this dish. The roasted garlic mashed potato on the side was scrumptious as well.Time for desserts. We dug in immediately when the Cinnamon Oblivion (SGD$13.90) was served. A beautiful concoction of old-fashioned vanilla ice-cream topped with homemade whipped cream, warm cinnamon apple cubes, cinnamon croutons, pecans and caramel sauce. This was a delightful dessert that was kind to the palate - not too sweet, and the cinnamon apple cubes were just simply refreshingly lovely.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/media-invite-dinner-at-outback.htm

The worse steak I've had for a long-time - and far better options for food in SIngapore. The steak was stone cold when served and meat was not very lean. The service staff were good enough
5
We ate there several times the New York steal was great but it always had the fat/grizzle left on. They have a gluten free menu, a great meal.All the staff very friendly, efficient and helpful
2
Only reason I did not give it 1 star was because of our lovely waitress.The portions were not not and very expensive. When we told our waitress that the meat was overcooked she got onto it right away. The problem was that it got re-cooked and again was well over cooked??I did call her back again and she did her best to apologise ( not her fault of course) by this time I was over it and said for them just to take it off the billMy wife's was cooked well but very tough not the best cut of meatWhen we got our bill the meal was still on there and our waitress had left for the evening. Had to argue with the manager and get him to go and check with the kitchen to confirm the returns??Will never return!

This the place for steaks. I like my steaks medium well. However, many of my friends like it slightly raw. The choco dessert is rather nice.
4
The best way to end a day of shopping is with some fruitilicious cocktails and crispy appetizers. i enoyed the spinach artichoke and the bushrooms, My boys loved the wings though. After filling ourselves with these appetizers we just went straight for the chocolate thunder. The portioning is huge. We gorged on it.I didn't get to scoop enough so will be visiting again soon

Reasonable priced dishes. Excellent ribs. Free freshly baked chocolate bread. Ample parking. Vidya, the manager is very friendly

when i have a short vacation with my family, we suddenly got hungry in the night and thinking to have a dinner near our hotel then we come to this famous Steak ( what i heard :) )A warm honey bread welcoming us with a small cup of butter..like the bread a lots, even my kids ask for more and the waiter are very welcome to give us for freeWe order the Outback special and prime ribs..also pasta with the kids, food come fresh with a big portion, meat cooked well and the mashed potato taste awesome.we finished it with the warm choco brownies with ice cream..price is affordable, ambiance is good..we surely be back to this restauran

We went to Outback steakhouse on the recommendation of a steak loving pal of ours who could not stop raving. We were greeted by very warm & friendly staff. For starters we ate the grilled shrimp, grilled to perfection, not over cooked and for mains the best baby back ribs ever in Singapore. My husband had a well done steak and too was very satisfied with his choice. A must try for every steak lover..
5
Just loved it. I was craving for some good food and that's when I found this place. They served mouth watering Baby back ribs and burger and the portions were large. Just yum
1
We ordered two steaks and a burger, the steaks were very undercooked and the bun on the burger was stale and hard. Meal sizes were very small and this was very expensive. Do not waste your time, you would get a better meal at McDonald's
4
Would've been 5 stars had the steak been well done as requested.
Overall, food and service were great. Great value for money. Chocolate Thunder From Down Under is AWESOME!
We'll be back soon!

I usually read a lot of reviews before i decide to visit a place, however i made this exception as we were walking passed their store in Millenia Walk and because my son insisted that he was dying of hunger. I was not expecting much but to my delight we were welcomed by a pleasant host. My son managed to finish most of his burger, which is rare, while I got to relish the cheese fries and Victoria's Filet. Overall, a nice lunch with some good service
2
We sought out this restaurant to have a giggle at the Australiana and to get some Western food whilst visiting Singapore. We didn't get much of either unfortunately. I was hard pressed to find anything Australian here from the decor to the drinks list. We ordered the 6oz sirloin with fries and corn on the cob and whilst I expected the steak to be smallish, the whole meal was tiny with about ten fries. It came on a smaller than standard plate and the plate still looked bare. In Australia, this size meal might be called a childrens' meal. The steak was OK, but at $30 the meal was extremely disappointing
2
Been to Western Aust.outlets and Bangkok outlet,food ,service and even atmosphere there is better than the two in S'pore.Just try the outlet at 313 Orchard.Service is terrible,food cold,steak....not fresh and expensive (by size ).But only the bread we enjoy.
2
I have been a few times for a quick evening meal at the Outback Steakhouse, just in front of the Conrad and opposite to Suntec in Singapore. The place is quite small, often appears dirty and overlooked, and often no friendly staff to greet you at the door. Instead more than once I had to get through the restaurant as if I was begging for an empty table.At no time was I impressed by the food here. Good steaks, but terrible service and above all very small portions. Last time we had to recall our waiter twice to ask her to bring what we ordered, since they apparently forgot to bring something. No excuse given. Not really a nice experience at all times, go there only if you are really hungry and need a quick meal
3
Was there for dinner on a Tuesday night. Utilized the voucher that I bought from deal.com which is quite value for money. It comes with 2 8oz of sirloin Steak plus soup of the day. We upgraded one set of the sirloin to ribeye for only $6.90 and is definitely the right choice. In comparison, the ribeye is much tender than the sirloin and it was good. It comes with standard two sides( mashed potato and seasonal veg ) , you can also choose to change it to other sides with an extra cost. Portion was big and the steak was cooked to perfection. We ordered the wings as well and it did not disappoint. However, the service yearn much to desires.. It wasn't very pack but we called out for the service staff to place our orders a few times but to no avail. It was until my partner went personally to speak to one of them and expressed our displeasure till it draw their attention! All in all food was ok but not great
3
I arrived in Singapore and did not want to eat in the Hotel. There was this place next to it. I decided for a soup and a burger. The soup was very delicious but not very warm, the burger was average. If you like onions you would probably give a bit of a better rating. All in all ok but not great.
3
Went there today with my father and we had the lunch special.Service was quick and friendly. Be careful as the weight is measured in ounces and promoted on their venue. E.g. their is offered a 6 oz steak which is just 170 g and may therefor not satisfy your hunger.The steak was cooked to perfection tho
2
Have been one week ago there (2nd or 3rd of October, 2014). Unfortunately the experience was a disappointment. I had great expectations as I've been many times in USA in the same. Very small choice of steaks. Asked for medium steak and receibed a well done one. My coleague asked for a medium-well and received a medium one. Nothing as ordered. I will not go back there. Waste of money

This feedback is based on our 4 visits to our local Outback Steakhouse in Orchard Gateway in Singapore. One of our visits out of 4 was with a Groupon voucher. The first time we visited Outback and had issues we just assumed that it was a one off but having had the same issues repeated on all 4 visits we have now decided we will not be going back to Outback again for food. The main issues with this Outback are the fact that the chef does not get the steak orders right based on each individual's preference and the staff who serve do not seem to be able to speak proper English and therefore unable to communicate which makes it very frustrating for the customers. How hard is it to employ staff who are able to speak English and communicate? They need to interview them and make sure they are suitable for the job before offering them a position!! Every time I have ordered a steak I have asked for "very very well done with no pink" but I have ended up with rare steak that looks pink with bloody juice running through it so I had to return my steak each time to be cooked properly. My husband asked for "medium done steak" and ended up with a piece of meat that had only been seared on the edges so it is basically still raw in a pool of blood juice. The food does not always arrive together so one person has to sit and watch the other person eat their food before their food arrives some time later! We ordered sauce with our steak which did not arrive with the steak and after asking our waiter several times we finally got it at the end of our meal! What is the point in that?!! The staff have no training it seems and do not know the drinks offered on the menu. They need to familiarize themselves with the Outback menu. The Groupon offer we used had very limited choice. Why were we not able to choose any side we wanted like fries instead of having to have the disgusting Outback mash potato that contains potato skin?! Why do they leave the potato skin in the mash? The offer did not include sauce with the steak so we purchased peppercorn sauce separately but when it arrived it was very similar to the mushroom soup we had earlier for starter except that it had been watered down and the mushrooms removed......It was horrible and did not go with sirloin steak! Our bill at the end did say peppercorn sauce but there is no way what they served us was peppercorn sauce! I was just not able to communicate with our waiter to discuss the issue with the sauce as he did not speak good English and we were unable to understand anything he said. The only positive point I can think of is the complimentary bread and butter given at the beginning of the meal which is excellent. However, bread and butter was not included in the Groupon offer

It was our first visit to Outback and I am certain it will be the last. We celebrate our dad's birthday and was deciding between Outback or Lenas but went ahead with Outback because they had a friendly hostess who was kind and enthusiastic, and took the initiative to ask if it was a special occasion when I enquired on the menu. When I mentioned it was a birthday celebration, she promised a whole birthday cake. What a nice gesture, we went ahead at dining at their establishment. Service from the waiter was excellent. I am sorry I did not catch his name but looking at the receipt that he presented, it says Syam S (Not sure if its him). The food was horrible. I feel so bad using the word horrible but it was that bad. The steak was not cooked to our preference. Those who wanted rare got well and vice versa. My parents rarely dine in at any establishments like that. It was always simple meals at your regular food court. They are not the sort who will complain or request a change of food but will quietly finish their food. I felt so sad just looking at them trying to finish the food. Never mind the food, I thought we could end the night with the birthday cake as promised, turned out to be a sliced of cake. So sad. What was promised by their hostess was not delivered. After we paid and left the outlet I asked why, from a promised whole cake to a slice of cake. The hostess twisted her words and said “When I said whole cake, I meant a slice of cake” ……… ????????????? Last visit for sure. Totally not worth the money paid. I am sure I could have got a better deal and quality of food next door (Lenas

This would have got 5 stars if my husband's burger had been cooked correctly. He asked for a well done burger but got it very raw. We told them and they changed it no problems though. We had the lunch deal which included a soft drink, soup to start & a main. We upgraded for just under $2 to have unlimited refills. The soup came out...possibly the nicest soup I've ever tasted. It had a bread baguette and butter to share for 2. The food was excellent in quality. Service was quick. Price was amazing! Would eat here again..recommended

We used to go quite often to Outback steakhouse in HongKong so we thought we'd try Singapore's.Service was good, our waitress Amanda was very nice and helpful. But the food ??! My fish and chips looked terrible, just dried fried fish and cold chips really. My boyfriend went for the Typhoon burger and was disappointed as well. The "big boy" beers were rather small and over priced.
3
After a few days of local foods, we wanted western. This place was hard to find, it's located inside a mall but there are 3 interconnecting malls. It doesn't compare to Outback in the states if you've been to a Outback in America before, but that was to be expected. The staff was nice, but our server barely spoke English (or spoke at all.) It was clean, and cool inside... Prices are outrageous inflated, even for Singapore! We paid more then we did at Hard Rock Cafe !!
4
We had a quick dinner with outback at their millenia walk branch. As we had some time on our hands we ordered some lamb steak and prime ribs. The lamb ribs were good but rather small in quantity. The prime ribs were good but a bit dry. Overall this place is not bad.
2
Stayed in a hotel opposite of this place so walked in for their lunch deal. We ordered a mushroom burger, kiddie burger, steak, and all was just average. Soup was served barely warm, almost cold. We had to fight many times to get waiter/waitress' attention, even though it wasn't that crowded. Not sure if they priortize on satisfying customers...we sat and waited to order while they all flocked to clear a table. We had to request for additional plates and napkins many times. Also noticed a staff coughing throughout, and questioned hygiene of the place. Service not that great, food is just average, price is expensive, came out disappointe

This is advertised as an Australian experience. Also advertises two for one drinks in happy hour from 6-8. We immediately had to argue over this deal but as it was on their website they agreed to honour the drinks deal - with the price of drinks in Singapore this does matter!The service was appalling. The food average at best. I would avoid eating here - the steak was edible. Salads soggy and ol

I suppose it's my fault for eating at an Outback Steakhouse while in Singapore but having had local food for a few days, I thought I could use something Western. A plate of nachos and a margarita later, I knew I should have eaten locally again. How can you ruin nachos besides t serving them cold, no jalapenos, and a light sprinkling of cheese with not much more. Also, a margarita is supposed to have at least some tequila -- but that doesn't happen here. I also don't appreciate people sweeping the aisle and under my table while I eat. Looks like putting some management into the mix would be of help. Stay away!

If you are looking for a juicy well cooked steak, cocktails to die for. I would recommend coming here. Oh and it is a MUST to get the 'Blooming Onion' starter (the name has changed but not sure to what)

Mixed feelings about this place. The waiter was really a nice and courteous guy, so really appreciate his effort. But, by design, the appetizer should show up before, or worst case during dinner ... not after the main course. Also, you are not supposed to bring my wife's steak out 10 minutes before mine. Those are basics ... not asking too much.My filet was good, but my wife's ny strip was not good at all. The place was almost empty, so there is really no excuse. It could improve if the kitchen gets its act together. Dont come here expecting the same food and service as the outback in the USA.The waiter removed the appetizer from the bill. We didnt ask, but it was a nice gesture. Again, the waiter's attitude saved the day for me

The menu is much the same worldwide.
The service was good, the food tasty enough, and the drink on a par with city prices.

Located in a Mall centrally located in the downtown business district but near many of the tourist attractions such as the Marina Gardens, and Sentosa Island. It is at the end of Orchard Road which is the main shopping street but you have to travel a mile or two from here up the road to the shopping area. I was hoping to get a touch of back home, but my favorite menu item at Outbacks's-lamb chops was not on the menu here. Disappointing. The chicken fried chicken I got was real chicken, while most places you get a pressed patty so this was an upgrade. Not cheap but nothing in Singapore is. As noted in a Mall and business district so ambiance around not great, but facility itself very nice as usual for Outbacks

Its a pity that we do not have one in India. Everytime I travel abroad, I ensure that I have steak and Beer at the Outback. This time me and my family walked all the way from City Hall to Suntech City in search of Outback... Finally got it :-)Food is too good..... Staff is very friendly and happy to server..... their smiling faces made the dinner even more enjoyabl

Good quality and reasonable prices for an Outback outlet...... Not the same quality as in the Americas but still good. Try the seared Tuna as an appetizer - but the full portion..............
3
The quality of the meat is still top notch. That what they do best. Unfortunately, the ambience at this location is sorely disappointing. It's neither a cafeteria nor a stake house, somewhere in between. Food is served on old plastic plates reminders of school cafeterias. The sides are pure school cafeteria.. an ice cream scoop size of mashed potatoes and a sorry presentation of vegetables (some broccoli, some cauliflower, some carrots) which looked exactly like what you find in the frozen foods section (and tasted like it). Quite disappointing. Staff was very good
1
Drinks were fine, although fairly pricey (avoid the cocktails, light on the alcohol) we shared a nachos starter, so far so good... Rapidly downhill for the mains! We only chose this hotel due to the proximity of our hotel and the fact that we had arrived earlier that day after a long flight and just fancied a quick steak. All 3 steaks were terrible, cold and awful cuts and all 3 were returned. 1 was not available so my husband 'passed' the others came back 10 mins apart and only 1 was edible, needless to say we were only charged for the nachos and drinks. Unfortunately the 1 shrimp my husband ate from the extra side order (which arrived 5mimd before his first steak) gave him a rather violent sickness episode during the early hours. One to avoid
3
The food was ok, the french fries came cold, but they exchange it, salad was good and hamburgers and meat were just fine, nothing really special. Beers cost around 9 dollars (small one), we didnt enjoy much, singapore has many better options...wouldnt go back

My wife and I from Australia decided on steak. Gave this place a go as we were walking past. Both went ribeye, medium done. Came out with barely a suntan, and oozing pools of blood. Sent it back for further cooking. Still poor meat, lots of fat and grizzle, barely ate half. Way overpriced for quality of cut. Vegies pretty boring, and small serving. The service was prompt and friendly, which was appreciated. Lighting and general ambiance very good. Problem appears to be in the kitchen and meat supply. Overall, not great value for money and wouldn't eat here again. On the plus side, nice mash potato

My family and I visited the restaurant on Sunday, 18th august, for dinner. The place was busy but we got our table really quick, which was great! We were served by a waiter( he is the only indian we see) and he was great with menu knowledge and service standard was high. The food was good and big portion which we really like it a lot.... Halfway through the meal, a manager approaches our table and checking on us, he was pleasant and speak good english, how not impressed are we? So we realized he was always smiling and supporting his colleagues with humor, and keeping everyone being well taken care of. How rarely you see such a great leader. So at the end of our dinner, we asked him for his name card, Daion Isaiah, such great experience. We will definitely come back soon for more! Great job Isaiah

Having dinner with the kids here months ago. Attended by an Indian young man and a attentive Chinese young lady. We're having pastas and Thunder as our dessert. It's all nice, nothing were fail. Feels like home.Will visit again in our next trip to Singapore

I was at "The Outback" for lunch. The mashed potato was fabulous but the chicken was not up to standard. I liked the drink too.
4
We eat in Outback in Florida regularly and always have a good staek, we were not disappointed with our meal in Singapore, Ok its not authentic and its far more expensive than in the US, but the steak was superb
5
It feels like you hit a goal in football match to find food this good and super cool service from all staff and crews. The restaurant's wooden interior was make’s me relax. Over all very “Satisfied!” More power guys.

As the name says this was a steakhouse. It was open later in the evening so a friend and I went to eat cause we were starving. If we could have gone anywhere else after we opened the menu and saw the prices we would have. My friend (Brit) had the fish and chips which he said was good. I had the chicken... as steak dishes were out of the ball park for me expensive. So I can't rate the meat but if you want a cheap dining experience this ain't the place
2
My husband ordered steak with pepper sauce. The cost was $40. He was given a lump of very fatty steak, and a liquid like jus in a bowl. He asked where the pepper sauce was and was promptly given it, with a new piece of steak that he requested, but the steak was even worse, much more fatty. He couldn't eat more that a mouthful or two. No apologies were made and no effort to compensate us was offered either. Would never recommend unless you are going to eat something other than steak
2
Restaurant was clean and neat. Being a Monday night, restaurant at 8:30pm was only a quarter occupied. You got the sense of a party waiting for people to arrive for the party to really start. The meal and ambience stayed that way throughout. All was expecting, never getting the desired experience. Given the lack of people you could expect more conviviality from the staff and attentive service...nope. A smile....nope. As for food, I had an Outback Burger. Was nice enough but it was at best warm and at medium rare there were likely to be repercussions...and there were for the rest of the evening. So if it's not hot, don't eat. Oh and the Free Flow coke - a licence to print money. Don't be fooled by it unless you are a real heavy coke drinker just ask for a single coke price. And if they don't give it complain. Why be forced to drink more than you want? Frankly quality and service at chain restaurants are highly correlated to how good the local owner and on the day manager. So it may be a global franchise, but its the manager that counts. Stick with a local owned and run steak bar. Try Brewerkz much better value for money and the burgers are nicer with real atmosphere any day, any time. Much better family environment. Going there for the next kid's family meal

My kids love Outback Steakhouse ribs in Australia, so very excited to see one in singapore. I checked this site for reviews and very nearly didn't go, but kids begged. Pleased I didn't take the advice of others. Our experience was awesome. Service quick and friendly, we had steak, kids had ribs, and couldn't fault it. Great meal, great service, great night. ::))

1.) Bad Service (takes them 15 minutes to come to your table to take an order)2.) Drink order was forgotten completely!3.) Steak was not cooked as orders (i.e. medium came as well-done and medium-rare as well-done, too).4.) Side order was not served as ordered.5.) Food was cold!Only upside: An apology from the manager and an invoice correction for the grub that they called steak

In desperation to get some cool drink in Singapore, we stopped into a restaurant chain, the Outback. We sat at the bar as the waitresses rearranged the whole place for a large corporate meeting that evening. Also at the bar was a gentleman who spent a lot of time talking on his phone. But then the manager joined him. It turned out that the man was selling meat and looking to become a supplier for Outback. He had brought along two piece of saran-wrapped meat. I thought they were beef patties but maybe they were some type of steak. Anyway, the man left the meat with the manager and walked out talking on his phone. We couldn’t get any more info, but it struck us as a strange way to sell meat to a restaurant.By the way, in Singapore, it’s a “typhoon bloom” onion for S$15.90, about $12US. But, the beer was S$9.90 (US$8.20) which seem to be an average price. Quite a difference from the $1 beer in Nha Trang
2
The menu gives good advice as to how the steak should be cooked and i chose Medium. The Medium description was brown on the outside and pink on the inside which is how I like mine cooked. What arrived looked like it was delivered from the butchers and the waiter was quite surprised when I sent it back for cooking!An expensive and disappointing meal I'm afraid.Alan Ward - International Mountain Leade

better options in singapore for dining, having said that the service is good and food above average. Its a good stop between shopping. The appertizers were the highlight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Me and my friends went to Outback Steakhouse on a recommendation also from a friend, and i could say that we had a great dining food experience that night.Located at the Milenia Walk, the ambiance is already an ideal place for social and private meetings.The food is excellent. As a starter, with had the chocolate colored bread with butter on the side.It also included a very delicious and creamy creme soup.On our menu that night was Grilled Salmon, Crispy Chicken Salad, New York Strip and of course the very tasty and best quality Baby Back Ribs. As always, a highly recommended Outback menu specially for beef lovers like me. :-)For finisher... which was the best part of the dinner, we ordered the dessert trio, a combination of Chocolate, Banana Nut Cake and , Cheesecake. Perfect! This is the place to go in Singapore if you'd like to have an excellent meals."Ambiance, Food and Service...an outstanding Outback experience indeed.

It was a chaotic day for me and really needed to do something to relax my mind and fortunately had a chance to do so with a dinner with my friends in Outback.Started with some appetizers to warm us up. The Nachos were quite ok, followed up with the wings and the ahi chopped salad which were really great! The no rules pasta was really like done with no rules at all but to satisfy you coupled with the baby back ribs which was deliciously done, of which would be perfect with more sauce.The prime rib which I tasted from my friend's plate was awesome! Also tried the grilled salmon which was just perfect to my taste combined with the crispy chicken salad.It was a very stomach-filling experience and a satisifed cravings for some grilled stuffs and steaks. The name speaks for it, Outback Steakhouse!We concluded the night with the Dessert Trio which was really a WOW for people like me who loves sweets after a meal.Definitely recommended for some time with family and friends!Will come back and bring my family there soon! (^_^

The woody ambience of the place would really give you the crave for good food and as I expected they delivered. The sashimi looking sliced tuna coated with black pepper blended with wasabi was AMAZING! And the onion string was a little bit to buttery but still a good start before devouring my steak the Signature Sirloin. I always like my steak to be as bloody as possible so I prefer medium rare and YES! I got my steak just the way I like it! The price is also reasonable accompanied by good service. I would wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for a delicious "outback" experience

Had a lunch and ordered the set. It included a creamy soup which I found to be delightful and very digestible. The surprise was the bread served. Not sure what is the flavor. Looks like a chocolate flavored bread but is soft, warm and burst with flavours of peppercorns. Thoroughly enjoyed the bread. The pasta with grilled chicken is ok, but portion is very big. The set also comes with drinks. For cold drinks seems to be "bottomless". The waitress actually refilled it. Good value for a nice lunch.

Nice relaxing evening with friends was decided to be at Outback Steakhouse. The staff was warm and very attentive to us. Surprisingly, it was contradictory from what others have posted in their reviews. The appetizers was quite hefty and filling. The Typhoon Bloom, Kookaburra Wings was a tad bit salty but still delectable. The Ahi Chopped Salad is an awesome starter....just nice! For main course, I got the the prime rib which was perfectly done medium as I have ordered. I had a taste of the New York Strip from my friend which was prepared medium-rare - yummy! We also shared the Baby Back Ribs that was finger lickingly delicious!Totally stuffed after this and no more space for desert. Will definitely come back to try the deserts and the Alice Springs Chicken or Grilled Salmon that my friends were raving about! Outback...we will be back

I bought the voucher from groupon and went there to celebrate my hubby's birthday as he loves steak. Firstly, the selection on the groupon is misleading which makes us feel cheated. Secondly, the service was very slow even though the restaurant was not even 1/4 full. We asked for chilli sauce and it took more than 5 mins to be served to us and some of the staffs were just idling around in the restaurant. Lastly, the food was so bad that even steak served by Aston is much bettter than the one which was served to me in Outback Steakhouse. I asked for medium well steak but it was served well done and the meat was so tough that i gave up eating. Half the fries were burnt and i couldnt eat it. Furthermore, appetiser was served after main course. I gave my feedback to the staff (he seems to be the restaurant manager) and showed him the fries but he didnt offer any apologies but just went off after clearing my cutleries. That will be my last time to Outback Steakhouse

I frequent Outback Steak Houses in the US when traveling on business alone. I like to sit at the bar, have an Outback steak and glass of wine. I was encouraged when the dark bread arrived as it always does in the US. Pretty much down hill from there. Ceasar salad was soggy, greens wilted, like it had been made early in the day. The baked potato was warm, not hot, and had also been cooked early in the day, and was not up to Outback standards as I know them. The real problem was the steak. I ordered the filet, at $40 SGD, expecting a tender piece of meat. While cooked to order properly, it wasn't so tough as it was chewy. Good flavor, but disappointing in texture. Lots of sinewy threads running through it. So, Outback in the US....YES, Singapore....not agai
2
A huge pity, it seems like the Outback Steakhouse is becoming a real fast food store. The experience of having a nice piece of steak and a couple of relaxing beers is slowly turning into a franchise that will do very well as a Drive-thru. From the moment I entered the Restaurant until I've paid my bill, it felt like they just want to process you through the feeding line. And it was not for the queue of incoming patrons! The meat was shocking, the menu mentions the marbling, but all I got was the fat. About half the piece of meat for which you pay by the oz was fat! Service staff could also not help much in explaining and helping you with the available choices. Thank you....for wasting my time and money ther

Experienced this restaurant in the evening for dinner as we've stayed in a nearby hotel. The staff was nice but a little slow sometimes.The ffod is rather small portion and not the best in town.The steak is good, the aussie fries not very tasty as well as the Ahi Tuna Salad.Nachos were not so good (especially the cheese on top).Wine choice is good and cocktails as well.Pricey restaurant for the quality you get but still a nice experience if you can afford it
4
Te food was awesome but the decor lets the place down. I'd still go back because the steak was great
2
Had the 'surf and turf' for a shockingly expensive S$40++ given the very small portions served. The bar and mixed drinks are good and the unlimited soft drink refills are a minor highlight. Save some money by having a burger at Mosburger next door then popping in here for drinks and skip the food
5
Have been to Outback Steakhouse here in Singapore a few times. This time, we went there with our son who ordered the Toowoomba Topped Sirloin where sauteed shrimp and button mushrooms are tossed in a cream sauce and served over a sirloin steak. The picture on the menu looked good, but when he ordered, he was a little disappointed though fortunately it tasted good! :DWe ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad and the New York Strip steak. Enjoyed the salad but somehow found the steak just a little tough.What we like about the restaurant is the free flow of soft drinks. :P Great for those who can drink a lot
3
Nice and acceptable steaks and that's it. Expensive beers (SGD 17,90 for a pint).Nothing special. We have been traveling in Sumatra before and needed some meat. But I am sure there is better places with more value for money. Staff was much better than I expected
5
I went to Outback on recommendation from a friend, and it was a great experience. Situated in a good location in Singapore, the ambiance in the restaurant makes it an ideal place for social and semi-professional meetings. The food is excellent. I and my friends tried three dishes, and all were very good. The Baby Back Ribs are highly recommended! The quality of service is also outsanding
2
After waiting at the entrance with 2 kids for a few minutes and being ignored we walked in and were ignored further. I had made a reservation (not needed) and had to ask someone for a table (the booking was never checked). All the staff looked fed up and tried avoid contact. No kids cutlery was brought and I had to ask twice to get some. The price is mid-range but the location, poor atmosphere and service means we won't be going back. Food was ok but nothing special and there is much better steak in Singapore

This review is for the Outback located in Suntec City Mall.After living in Singapore for five months, I was really craving some good American food. Outback delivered. (I know, Outback is supposed to be Australian... but not really. It's an American chain.) I've had a hard time finding a place with good portions and just good solid food since I've been here, and Outback gave me a little taste of home.Their menu is very similar to the American menu - staples like the blooming onion, steaks, Alice Springs Chicken and entree salads are all available. I was so excited to find that they even had the spicy ranch dressing! I'll definitely be back
2
My husband and I with a small kid went here a few day before Valentine's Day. The steak was quite a lot fat and mine was meh. My kid who loves spaghetti refuses to eat her kid meal. It was very small portion and 'few shredded of cheese as a topping. We waited more than 30 mins just to clear our bill. To be fair, we used to come here every three months with yummy food but since this incident we stop coming completely. I understand it was busy, around 6pm but with Outback standard and price, I don't come over to buy crappy food and service
3
Had my dinner here this week. Service was average. While they were friendly and all smiles, the waiter that served my table was without that smile, looked very tired, all worked out and was clearly sweating wet all over his forehead and face. Waiting time was ok.The bread was good and all of us liked it. Main course, I had the bbq baby ribs. They were below average, not as good as many other restaurants in Sg. It just wasn't as tasty as expected. My friends who had steak said that theirs were just ok. Margarita was great, Luv it! Nachos, quite nice.The worst, the espresso! Never had such bad espresso before. All of us ordered double shot espresso and it all came very diluted. A friend of mine jokingly said that we ordered espresso with "double shot water"
3
Could have been in any american steak joint but I suppose they did sell Fosters (luckily there are plenty of other choices). I was on my own but friends had dined here earlier in the week and were impressed by the steak. Burger was good - tender meat - but bun was unpleasantly thin and had a taste of stale oil. Got rid of it and was well. No atmosphere and expensive for what it is
4
I like the Outback Steakhouse because we don't have them in Australia. LOL.
Not quite Australian food, but good steak at a reasonable price.

will feel guilty after eating, so.. sinfull...
2
Dined here because of the restaurant's proximity ot our hotel, the Conrad and it meant we did not have to venture out in a tropical storm. Food was average and not of a standard that a 'steakhouse' presents where the name suggestss they know how to handle meat. Wine list is limited and not of value. Surprisingly, red wine was served cold. That is Ok if you have the right wine but not with wines on the list.Despite the rain, we would have been better of to have dined elsehwre

If you are a true carnivore , and a steak lover , this is the place to have hearts fill . Their outback special is amazing . Be careful with the dessert , These truly delicious desserts are large portions .. so only order a sampler unless you are a great one for dessert . Truly amazing , Never miss it if in Sinapor

I've visited this restaurant a couple of times previously, but the experience of my last trip has to be the best so far.Visited Outback Steakhouse with my partner on 26 Feb for dinner.When we were ready to order, caught the eye of one of the servers and she immediately came over and took our orders. After taking our orders, she introduced herself as Vivian and will be our server of the day. While waiting for our orders, we were served bread (we absolutely love their bread!)We finished our bread before our orders came. Vivian came over and asked if we would like another portion of bread.In the midst of our meal, she walked over and asked how our steaks were. Our steaks taste great - as always. When we requested for the bill, Vivian even signed off the bill with "Thanks! See You Again! :) - Vivian" With such a personalised note, how not to feel happy?She has been very pleasant and always happy to serve. Thumbs up! Definitely a gem to their team
3
It's very similar to Tony Romas (which is in Suntec City) but I think Tony's is better and cheaper. Food is just your average American-style junk food. Is it supposed to be Australian though? Not sure, with it being called Outback perhaps it is but it doesn't seem any different to other US style places.They do stuff like chicken tenders, ribs, burgers, onion loaf etc. Price is around $15-30 for mains
3
Food: Meats quite forgettable. Actually this place is good for hearty salads, warm bread and crispy fried blooming onion. Salads so huge they can make for a full mealService: They may not be attentive at times or nowhere to be found but overall still passable. I remember there was once they give free sample portions of the smoothies they were launchingAmbience: Cosy and more dimly lit, with laidback atmosOverall: Worth a visit if u yearn quiet place hang out in groups

I usually enjoy Outback in the United States, but the steaks here are substandard in comparison. I actually tried eating here twice. Since I usually order the Sirloin or Victoria Fillet, I thought I'd try the Sirloin. The waiter convinced me the Ribeye was superior, so I trusted him and was totally disappointed. The steak was so thin, tasted terrible, was overcooked (I ordered it medium and it was well, well done) and tough as leather. Since I arrived to early get the Baked Potato, I settled for the Fries...they were greasy and also overcooked...probably fried twice. The bread was extremely hard and totally unlike any Outback bread I've had before. The only food I enjoyed was the salad, which costs extra... and except for the bad steak cut recommendation, the service was OK. Not to trust one bad experience, and really wanting a good outback steak, I thought I'd give it one more chance. Unfortunately, this time it was only slightly better. I did go for the Sirloin this visit and arrived at a time I could get a Baked Potato. The steak was cooked to order and it was also as thick as I'd expected. Even the flavor was better, however, it was still a very chewy cut. There was several times I couldn't hardly even cut through it with the big outback knife. The baked potato was also of poor taste...but this could be just a difference in local produce.Over all, the service was very good both days, as was the salad. Unfortunately, the steaks were a huge disappointment. I will not be going back

Not that I'm an addict but I've been to a few Outback Steak Houses around the world. They're as Australian as Victoria Secrets is English obviously…At home in America, of course, the portions are so large you can barely walk after a salad and in Asia they tend to feel roughly the same although with welcome smaller portions. The atmosphere is generally fun wherever you go but this one in Singapore was awful.There place was empty, which should have been a hint, plus they only sell Heineken (very Australian) but when I received my meal I actually asked for the menu back so I could compare the photograph. I have never refused a meal in my entire life but this was the saddest plate I had ever seen and nothing like the picture in the menu. I couldn’t even recognize it… I ordered an 8oz steak and was told the 10oz was the same as the picture… Mmmm right! A bit like I would pass for Michael Schumacher with a red cap on, so I sent it back, finished my beer for which I was charged service (nice touch) then walked around the corner to the Paulaner Brauhaus where I had a great meal, once I found a seat because it was packed, and everything was half the price I would have paid for a pretend Australian restaurant

The steak is fine here. Order a medium cook steak but were given a rare cook steak but it was send back to the kitchen after telling it to the waiter. A Tip for diners..... apply for the membership 1st before dine in. Membership cost $29 exclude GST with $25 dining vch plus other discount. I wanted to apply on the spot but can't be use on the same day as i dine in. Only can be use once the card & vch were given two weeks after. This is a family place...
