When we arrived the restaurant was closed for good. The attached announcement informed that they changed address but when we called they say that now it's chineese cuisine.

Had dinner there. Found the food rather nice generally. Ambience was also nice, although service was mixed. One lady was very good, another seemed to be slack.
5
Great for family and dating. Great service in Singapore context, the (Russian? ) lady who introduce food and vodka to us is extremely friendly and good service. Will go back to try other dishes !

Well, well, well - there is something seriously wrong going on here. A few months back, this was a reasonably good place, with quite authentic Russian food. But at this point - it barely deserves the "average" rating. Yes, it's still the same decor inside - but (i) the portions became significantly smaller (so where is my beef stroganoff on this plate), (ii) the food is prepared quite carelessly (vereniki overcooked, kulebyaka dry, garnish non-existent), (iii) the most Russian component to the food is the name. The service was rather disorganised. And worst of all - the atmosphere. No trace of the good mood that used to be there - everything quite stiff, pretentious, and boring. As Eastern Europeans, we went quite nostalgic, but couldn't be forced to give more than an average rating. Sad to see this place fade

Went there as a group for dinner and was impressed with the initial service.. and that's set me up for disappointment later.Had mashed potatoes (yummy and creamy but still very light!) and Chicken Kiev (amazingly tasty and surprises you with clarified butter flowing out of the chicken roll when you cut into it).The food was exemplary but the staff suffered for lack of manpower. 1 mains and 1 side went missing.. the staff were so hassled they didn't manage to sort it out to quite a while later and a couple of reminders. The bill took about an hour or more to be settled because it takes time for them to key in once, rekey in (mistake found) and all that. I would suggest going to Buyan on a day where they would be less busy as they are swamped with the lack of manpower. The food is really worth going there for.Would have rated this restaurant very good but my current experience precludes that
5
I recently had dinner at Buyan with co-workers and was really looking forward to trying Russian food in Singapore being a fan. Buyan definitely didn't disappoint. The restaurant had a great atmosphere, small but perfect size for a group to meet and have dinner. Great decor and very relaxing. The service was outstanding, everyone was very friendly and attentive. I had the Chicken Kiev and it was outstanding. Along with the salad and appetizer everything was very well prepared and tasted amazing. Everyone else in our group also commented how good their food was.Would definitely put this on your list of places to try in Singapore for a little change of pace
5
If you have a craving for Russian food, this is definitely the place to go. The Borscht is amazing and the Pelmeni is fantastic. I often go with a friend who lived in Moscow and she said it's just like going back. The horseradish vodka is very tasty and they have fantastic Georgian wines. The owners are so friendly and the service is fantastic. After the first time we went, they remembered us and welcomed us back as if we were coming into their home. The atmosphere is very rustic and looks a bit like a log cabin. There is a very warm and comfortable feel. You may want to go early as the band, although excellent, can be a little loud making conversation a bit difficult. This is a must visit.

First time trying russian food and Buyan did not disappoint :) The staff and bartender were friendly and attentive!Had the Caviar and Khachapuri for starters... Beef stroganoff and Baranya noga (lamb shank) for mains. Finally, had Blinis with cream / jam / condensed milk for dessert... And Russian vodka cocktails. Prices were slightly steep, especially with caviar costing $40.. All the above came up to slightly more than $200... But it was ok for me since I had the 50% discount from my Amex card
2
We had very high expectations of this restaurant and have been planning to go there for a while. The food was ok - we had borsch, gulyash, pancakes with caviar, salted cucumbers (which were actually marinated cucumbers which none of us like generally), olivie salad, honey cake (medovik) and napoleon cake. Deserts were awful! Everything else was very average. Besides I didn't like the ambiance of the restaurant, didn't have this authentic feel. I have something to compare to - Mari Vanna restaurant in London, for instance. You feel you're back home the moment you enter the place: you are greeted by Russian waitresses, the place itself reminds of a very cosy Russian home with Russian music. That's the kind of thing we were expecting to see in Buyan. Also waitresses were very slow and not very eager to serve customers, I had to ask for the same thing several times. My verdict - I probably wouldn't come back there again.

Went on Friday evening. Restaurant cum bar was easily located on a slip road from Duxton road. Ordered sautÃ©ed vegetables which tasted wonderful and its herring on fur coat appetiser was simply tasty and uniquely different! Napoleon dessert cake was simply divine- must try!Service in the beginning was rather slow with wait more than 5 min before seated though reservation already made. However service picked up along the way with more dedication shown
3
I was surprised to find this place. Interesting design, different from the neighbours. Average Russian food, but good place to drink.
5
The food and service is excellent. Staff attentive and courteous. Stayed for the live band after dinner. Enjoyed very much. Place is cosy. Good for family & friends gathering as restaurant not noisy.
4
Probably the one Russian restaurant left in Singapore. Nice "homely" decor. Great selection of drinks from Russia to Eastern Europe. Standard fare like shashliks are done well. Not much with regard to cuisine from the 'stans, though. Staff and service is, on the whole, friendly.
4
To me the hallmark of the food here is the richness of the flavour...everything here is tasty...the decor is intimate and cozy too..great service..totally recommend this place
4
food is tasty though a bit priciy. we had borsht (soup), kwass (drink), mors (drink) cheese flat bread, grilled platter, beef straganov, blinis (dessert), honey layered cake (dessert). portion not big. nice ambience, not crowded when we were there. big bar area.overall good place to chill out on a sat nite
5
I have visited Buyan few times, as for lunch as well as for dinner and drinks. The staff is always warmly welcomed us and is very helpful. I know the test of the real russian food and can definitely confirm that food in Buyan tastes as it should be. They also served some food from former USSR countries - especially I like ''Georgian khachapuri'' and ''Chicken ala Kiev''. And it is the only place in Singapore where they always have at least few bottles of an ice frizzed vodka which goes well with their Sprat Bites and Solenya. And of course, blini for desert!
4
The place is nicely decorated and the staffs are very friendly and attentive. The olvie salad was good but not great. The shishak was a mixed of grilled lambs, salmon and chicken which was perfectly done. The beef straganoff was also quite nice but slightly watery. If you want to try something different this is the place to go
5
We took our friends to show them the real Russian food, and it was the best choice. First of all, food was fantastic. The restaurant itself has national Russian rustic spirit, staff is very friendly and polite. You should better book the table, because it's pretty small. PS beverages were so good
5
The title sums up my review and oh yes, the borschtl soup was excellent too! Only note that our one order of soup which we said we'd be sharing, was served together with our 2 main courses so 1 main had to sit and wait. But having said that, would definitely go back again! Highly recommended
4
Came for drinks and snacks, stayed for dinner. My dining companions are somewhat well versed in their vodkas, and were suitably impressed with the variety and quality of the vodka on offer. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was good- though I'm not a big fan of this kind of fare, I enjoyed the meal- some classics on the menu like beef stroganoff which were impressive. Overall a good experience
4
Awesome food but a little pricey for the portion given.
Staff are commendable. Manager who gave detailed recommendations on wine, staff who are attentive and makes you feel at home.
5
Lovely little restaurant pub, Buyan Russian Restaurant and Bar is great. Food was cooked to perfection and a great little band playing live music.
4
Service was really good in this restaurant. My friend and I ordered a soup to share and it came in two smaller individual portions.
5
Randomly picked this place for dinner due to its interesting menu. I have never tried russian food and i must say this is a surprise find. I thought that this will be serving up real gimmicky food, but the food is flavorful and hearty. Main dishes:Chicken, Lamb and Salmon Charcoal Grill (Shashlyk)We tried the most expensive on the menu and I must say, its worth it.Everything on that platter was done right. no complain.Beef Strips on a bed of mash potatoes (Beef Stroganov)Beef is done juicy and tender. Mash potatoes consistency was just right. Dessert:Napoleon. Suppose to be traditional. However, after a heavy meal, we find this dessert a tart too rich and "starchy" for our liking.The service staff was friendly and helpful. He recommended a couple of drinks but again, both of us were too filled up to try anything.Perhaps next time
4
A decent place to unwind after dinner for some good cocktails with a Russian twist, live music and delicious Russian desserts. Ordered Black Russian and Szatlotka and were not disappointed. For desserts we ordered the Napoleon cake which is good for people who don't like their desserts to be very sweet. Service is good wherein the staff were knowledgable about the cocktails and desserts and were able to suggest according to our tastes.... Surely warrants another visit...
3
This as a birthday present to my Russian girlfriend was definitely a surprise. Trying the Ukrainian and Armenian beer was definitely a good experience next to the food coming afterwards. Though to my (and her).experience the food was not well spiced and smaller than expected, but still enough to get you not hungry anymore. Prices were a different topic. In my opinion overpriced. Yet, if you are missing russian food, you may go there. Still suggest russkiy dome close to Haw Par Villa over this one simply for the taste, not though for the ambience
4
Given the limited traditional Russian restaurants in this part of the world, this is definitely a gem. Helpful service staff will guide you through the menu and the warm ambience makes one feel like dining at home. There is also a good selection of alcoholic drinks to go with the dishes
5
Katya Gabalova, the head of marketing and events at Buyan has been hands down, the highlight and key determinant for holding a special birthday celebration for my husband at the restaurant. Not only she went above and beyond her call of duty to ensure that the event was a smashing success, she took a special trip to the store to buy balloons for his surprise birthday, as I couldn’t do it that day.The atmosphere was great, all the guests loved the food, and we were celebrating in a separate room with about 20 people. The restaurant allowed bringing a bottle of vodka for a corkage fee of $150. Also, we could bring one bottle of wine for the 1 ordered from the menu. I picked the Georgian wine which wasn’t that expensive and I knew should be great. The service was excellent, the ambiance great, there was great music live and of course, there was a birthday cake that I brought in the day before with candles lit – all done and prepared by the stuff!In all, not a better place to celebrate our birthday occasion.When I came the day before to make arrangements, James, the manager, courteously picked up my lunch bill and gave me his hot spot Wi-Fi, which was greatly appreciated.Thank you Katya and James and the entire stuff of buyan
4
This gem at Duxton is THE place to go if you've never had russian food before. My favourite dish of the night was the Pelimeni (Russian dumplings). The meat was flavourful and the skin of the dumplings just thick enough to soak up the broth it was in without being too heavy. We also enjoyed the Kulebyaka (Salmon Pie). We were stuffed by the end of the night and had to skip dessert so we'll definitely be back on day for the Blinis.At definite plus point of this establishment is the staff. Staff are attentive and great at giving recommendations. Two servers attended to us and both of them were excited to be talking about Russian and Georgian food. We learnt quite a bit from them in terms of the cultural and practical differences and similarities between both cuisines. They were also very attentive and saw that each dish was explained to us.
2
Went to this small Russian restaurant in the trendy Duxton Hill area of Chinatown with friends. Lovely area with nicely restored shophouse bars and restaurants. This restaurant is owned and run by Indians, and I couldn't help wishing they had stuck with Indian cuisine. The only Indian element was the wine, which is not what you really want. I know Singapore is expensive but this seemed ridiculously so for what we had; some second rate caviar and some other nameless main. Don't bother
5
It was nice to have lunch with friends. Atmosphere was fantastic, very friendly staff, lovely Russian food for the reasonable price. The dessert was absolutely wonderful!
5
Nice interior, very good menu of food and drinks. Good atmosphere with nice music...
Price level is very good considering the quality of food and drinks.
4
The place has the decor of a log cabin that reminds me of a hunting lodge in Kolomenskoe Moscow. Food we ordered are good and enjoyable - Chicken Kiev, Mushroom Julien, Potato Vareniki and Olasye Karat. Very filling so we were not able to try the desserts!We enjoyed the recommended drinks too - Black Russian, White Russian, Szarlitka and Russian Sangria. Staff are quite friendly and helpful. We appreciate the complimentary shots of drinks they served us too. A compliment to Alex and James.Must go back for more caviar and dessert next time!
3
Came here today to try the 2 course set lunch at $15++. I opted for the cabbage soup and pasta whilst my lunch companion chose the soup and the Chicken Kiev. Food was nice enough but not spectacular. Service was friendly, although the meals took a little while to prepare. There was a minor issue with my meal: it was supposed to be pasta with beef, but no beef was actually included. When I queried this aspect after the meal they very kindly offered to give me an additional portion including beef, but by that stage I had already eaten enough. A glass of Kvass is also included in the set lunch. Overall quite ok but nothing to rave about
5
We went on a Saturday and I was very pleasantly surprised with this restaurant and can only assume that previous bad reviews are because the restaurant is ran differently during the week, although I haven't been on a weekday.The food was very tasty, especially the starters (mimosa salad, vareniky and vinaegret) and the portions generous enough. The main (kulebyaka - salmon, rice, mushroom filled pastry) was good but not worthy of a special mention.The service was good, quick and attentive. The drinks are probably the weakest link, but that is a common in Singapore: a lot of ice, very weak and very pricey. It didn't help that, as a previous review says, the waiters (more than one) didn't know how to serve the drinks from the jar which, yes, is as simple as it sounds.There's also live music and the band does a good job, however we sat outside so the band from the restaurant next door was much more audible to u
5
You can't find a lot of Russian restaurant here. So this one is definitely worth to try. Tuck in at Duxton hill. It have a nice and cozy ambience. Like the bar set up just when you enter the place. The beef stroganoff is a must try with a creamy rich taste. Had the beetroot and beef soup as well which is also nice. Can't remember the name. But overall it is a nice restaurant and worth for a visit
1
What started as an adventurous night with a new cuisine turned into a horrid dining experience, leaving a bitter aftertaste of Russian food. Choice of mains for the restaurant week dinner menu was between the beef goulash and chicken patties with mash potato. Ordered both, and while the beef goulash was tasty, the meat chunks were tough and really dry. The chicken patties with mash tasted no better than a frozen microwave meal. In fact, fast food outlets have tastier chicken patties. They were dry, tasteless and came with barely a drizzle of sauce. Even the mash potatoes were lacking in flavour. Simply appalled that chicken patties with mash are served as a representation of what Russian food has to offer. Desserts were terrible too. There was a potato cake of sorts which just tasted like a really dense butter cake. The choice of desserts did not complement the dinner menu either. Food aside, the most appalling moment of the night came when the jug of sangria ($60) we ordered only filled three glasses, when a glass of sangria costs $16. Is it not perfectly reasonable to assume that a jug would be able to fill more glasses? Or perhaps 1.5 rounds at least? Why else were we paying $12 more? Confused, we asked a waiter and his response was even more shocking. He explained that a glass of sangria contains more ice cubes and has a much lower alcohol content than what they would include in a jug. Hence, our glasses of sangria, filled from the jug, had more alcohol. That just did not make any sense to us. So a single order of sangria at $16 is just a diluted version of red wine? The waitress who served the jug also did not know how to do it correctly - she didn't stir the contents and instead poured straight into our glasses when it was clear there were two distinct, unmixed liquids in the jug. After correcting her, she poured the sangria back into the jug, remixed it, and poured it out again, making a wet mess at the table. Food and service both were beyond disappointing by restaurant standards. And if this is what Russian food has to offer, i'm afraid I've lost interest in the cuisine
2
We have visited Buyan for the Singapore Restaurant Week and we ended up being very disappointed by the food. We had the dinner menu (after the staff mistakingly pointing us to the lunch menu, twice...) Starters were fine. Mains had major issues: the goulash was overcooked (dry meat), the buckwheat groats were overcooked too. The minced chicken breaded cutlets were done as well as possible, given that the dish is a school canteen horror. I don't understand why any restaurant would willingly put it on a menu designed to attract new customers. The desserts were nice and redeemed the food experience a bit. While we are on questionable decisions, Buyan uses iPads instead of regular menus for some unfathomable reason. There is no booking app, no interactive menu - you're just using an iPad to view a static PDF file. Also, the drinks are in a separate PDF file, which just means you won't find them until the staff points them out to you. Pointless gimmicks, not matching the style of the place.We also had some caviar blinis as an extra starters and we were very happy with those - excellent quality caviar, elegant classical serving. The kvass we had to drink was another disappointment though - very flat and bland tasting, like it was sitting in an open bottle (same effect as you'd have with a coke).The regular menu had some interesting and familiar dishes on it, so Buyan may have some redeeming qualities after all. There was a setup for a live band as well, the interior design was very nice and the staff polite. It's a shame that they didn't treat the Singapore Restaurant Week seriously. I wonder how many more potential customers they have turned away

Our first try of russian cuisine, and my husband & I both agreed that the food there is beyond our expectation. Thumbs up!!! Excellent food!!! We had meat khachapuri, which smell & taste equally awesome. The fragrance alone makes my husband & I craved for it. We also had shashlyk. The chicken, lamb & salmon were marinated & charcoal grilled perfectly, the meat was tender & juicy. Love it, one of the best I ever had!!! Their Borscht soup & Napoleon cake is also yummy. Buyan had an extensive menu of wine & beer too. The service is not too bad :) We head down on a saturday night and they had live band (good) after 9pm. Overall, we had a great dinner & aim to return to Buyan for dinner again. Would definitely recommend anyone to try russian cuisine at Buyan :
4
I am yet to meet anyone who is a FAN of Russian food, but there really should be some. A good place to start is Buyan, a great Russian restaurant in Singapore, with an incomparable wine list. The food is authentic (a Russian friend confirmed this). We tried two salads - The Olivier (also known as "Russian salad" and Mimosa - and both were superb, as was another starter - Herring under the fur coat (herring covered with vegetables). Pelmeni - a kind of Russian dim sum - also went down well. Finally we finished off with Kulebyaka, a hearty Russian pie filled with salmon. On previous visits I have tried staples like Chicken Kiev (one of my favorites) and Shashlyk kebab - both very good. Buyan also has a reasonably-priced wine list and good set lunches
4
Buyan has both a bar and dining section. The bar is stocked with extensive range of close to 50 different types of vodka. The range of whiskeys offered is almost as impressive. I thought the masculine setting attracted a more serious and business like crowd. This is good for drinkers that prefers a quieter setting and to have a good conversation. Nevertheless the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. We were there during the $3/g caviar promotion which complimented our vodka tasting perfectly. Food was well prepared and done with good quality produce. However, we don't find all the dishes appealing to our taste orientation. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall it was an enjoyable evening with a masculine appeal
4
I was twice there. Musical band there is excellent. Pleasant atmosphere and arrangement. Restaurant has 2 floors: bar area+dinning area - ground floor, dinning zone plus open air bar located on second floor. Restaurant' furnishing - seems came from French or Dutch motif. My impression - Catherine Great style, very positive and romantic. Menu - designed with love, main intention, as I understood - create opportunity for people to try Russian dishes, rare abroad usually. BUT. Chef seems Singaporian because every dish has slight Singaporian "footprint". Meal quality is absolutely fine, but the taste is not 100% authentic. In general there are no critical findings, but calibration of the current chef by Russian specialist is necessary
3
Set lunch at normal time is S$18++ and quite good. Eapecially liked the shashlyk, good chicken and lamb with grilled vegetables.During the resaurant week, set lunch is S$25++ and the value of the meal was much lower. We had choice of lamb fried rice or croquette, just carbs and very little meat. Would try again after restaurant week is over.They serve slow so estimate minimum 90 minutes lunch time
4
It has an extensive bar with a few tables. There is also live band entertainment playing predominantly classic rock n blues. It's probably the only place in Singapore serving Russian wines and a variety of vodkas, and in a casual setting too.The menu consisted of Russian favourites and we only had Chicken Kiev (ok, this one is Ukrainian) and Pelmeni because we were not hungry. Overall, the flavours were good and we were stuffed. The wines and vodkas were interesting and a good experience. The service was warm and efficient.On the whole, it was slightly more expensive when compared to many such similar styled F&B places and I am looking forward to go back again
1
What a waste of time.20 staff milled around doing their best to avoid work while we waited 90mins for caviar. Caviar that doesn't take any cooking or preparation beyond moving from a jar to a plate!!We decided after waiting this long we were just going to pay for drinks and leave...They almost took as long to bring us our bill for drinks, after waiting a further 15mins for the bill we left the approximate cash and walked out. Not one of the staff who milled around doing "busy work" even noticed us pack up and walk out.Don't even entertain this place
4
I thought I need to write a comment here as some other reviews are really bad. We've been a group of 4 ladies and first it looked like there was no table. The staff then reshuffled people and we got a table. They were really friendly and the appetizers we ordered were tasty. Wine list great as well

Click http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/05/buyan-russian-haute-cuisine-caviar-bar.html for full post with pictures!Miss K. and I embarked on a Russian lunch escapade at Buyan, named after a mythical Russian island in one local fairytale. To maximize the variety, we ordered different items from the 3-course lunch($25) menu. The unique Russian black rye bread served with velvety butter that resembled mini billiard balls were signs of a good meal ahead.The first appetizer was Kharcho, a spicy Georgian lamb soup filled with rice grains and chunks of lamb. I usually do not expect much spiciness from western food but this soup had quite a robust peppery flavorThe 2nd appetizer was a classic Russian bite, Pelmeni (cold dumplings stuffed with mixed meat fillings). The unleavened dough skin made with just flour and water was indeed thick and chewy. However, the overall taste surpassed its dull presentation as the filling had a pleasant savoury taste without any strange odour.I thought the portion of the main course-Blinis with creamy chicken filling was only sufficient for kids. But unexpectedly, these traditional Russian pancakes had a sweet allure that matched perfectly with the savoury mushroom dip. The sauce was so delicious that we requested for moreThe Buckwheat kasha with Mushroom and Onion surprised us with its fine grainy texture. It tasted like a healthier version of fried rice as it is less greasy but yet extremely aromatic. Kasha generally means buckwheat but it can include cereal, mill, wheat,barley and oats.There was only one option for the dessert-Milk Kissel, a mixed of milk and raspberry jelly. Though this was not fanciful western-style plated dessert, I like its gloopy texture and the fact that it was not too rich or sweet.Fortunately, the restaurant agreed to change one of the set dessert to a dessert platter without any additional charge. Though the Milk Kissel made its appearance again, there were new faces such as the Napolean (vanilla Millefeuille with fresh berries) and the Honey Cake. Both were excellent in their own arena; especially the Honey Cake which is more similar to a crunchy Baklava than a cake. Conclusion: The $25-lunch menu may vary with the $35-dinner menu but the quality and portion of the food are similar. This was my first try at Russian cuisine, thus I had no previous reference to compare with. But we enjoyed the meal as it is easy to get used to the taste of Russian food (no particular exotique ingredients like bear paws, etc...). I would definitely return to try not the dinner, but the lunch deals at SGW, especially when there are more interesting cuisine worth trying.For Full post with pic: http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg

The bar is very nice and a great live band was performing, however our experience was ruined by a very rude, aggressive and cocky Indian manager with a dyed-white strip of hair. A group of us had come to celebrate a birthday and a wedding anniversary. After waiting a short time for a table, none were available so we took seats at the bar (which was fine). We noticed later that the table behind had vacated and we asked this manager (politely) if we could please move to the table. Immediately and without warning he started shouting abuse at us. We were all very upset at this and later told him when he returned that this was not an appropriate way to talk to guests. He offered no apology just saying "so what's your problem?". He then told us the bar was closed - effectively trying to throw us out because we confronted him about his bad behaviour. There was an Aussie barman who saw the situation and later came over and was very apologetic for the Indian man's behaviour. He told us that he had been shouting at guests all night. We would not go back again simply because of the incredible rudeness of this man. We were there for a celebration, not to get abused by such an awful man

Selected this restaurant to try for Restaurant Week. Was deeply disappointed with the menu offered under the Restaurant Week promo. The main courses for both the lunch ($25) and dinner ($35). We didn't bother with the lunch menu as the mains were more vegetarian..the mains for the dinner menu were both pastries/pies - salmon or beef. They ended up looking and tasting like the pastries I could have gotten from 7/11 at $2 bucks per piece. We were so upset that we didnt bother with the desserts at all. Oh the appertizers were not any good either.. I will never go back there again
1
Went there last week with wife and another couple. By chance, we knew the assistant manager from his previous place of employment. We told him that we were primarily interested in the beef stroganoff, and a few other things that would go well with it. We also indicated that we were open to trying some carviar if it was reasonably priced. He indicated he understood and went off to place our order. What came was two servings of caviar, one black and one green. Both were okay but the ladies found the green one to be too fishy.A few other simple dishes came including the strogonoff, which was good.Then the shocker, bill was $2200, without any alcohol. Guess that is what "reasonably priced" at Buyan means. (kinda explains how they can afford to buy champagne found in the wreck of the Titanic

This is a beautiful restaurant, nice atmost=phere and probably best wine selection in Singapore (i know, a surprise in a Russian Restaurant may be?).
A great place for a different evening and diner.
4
I have never had Russian food so I was excited to try this restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Kiev. I don't usually order chicken in Singapore because it usually is dark, grisly meat. The Chicken Kiev on this menu said chicken BREAST so I ordered it. The presentation was beautiful. I was excited to take my first bite. I cut into it and it was the typical Singaporean dark, grisly chicken. I could eat about half of it picking through all the yucky parts. I mentioned to the waitress that what I had on my plate was not what the menu had described. She smiled and took it away. This is also typical Singaporean....she was nice but she wasn't going to do anything about it. If I had not needed to get my daughter home I would have asked to speak to the manager. I will try again because the other plates at my table looked good. Next time I will make sure I get what I order

My wife (who is Russian) and I (who have visited, lived and worked in Russia for over 10 years) visited Buyan in Duxton Hill last Wednesday night. We had heard that Buyan was the place to go for Haute Russian cuisine in Singapore and had heard the stories of their fantastic wine list. While Russian cuisine isn't known for its exotic flavors, we were both looking forward to a nostalgic dinner to remind us of Russia.I'll get the nice part out of the way here by saying that the decor was nice (something you would see in a themed restaurant in Moscow), the staff helpful and the beer was cold.But the food was just simply disappointing. I ordered the pelmini (dumplings) for an appetizer and we both ordered the golubsty (stuffed cabbage rolls) for the main. These are two dishes you can always count on in any Russian restaurant to come out the way you expect as they are very basic staples. Well, not at Buyan. The pelmini came out undercooked and chewy. There was an attempt at seasoning with some herbs, but you could not taste anything but the dough. The stuffed cabbage rolls arrived smothered in some sauce that I assumed was a blend of sour cream and tomato paste, which I had to scrape off. On top of that the "cabbage" they used had to be some local green rather than actual cabbage as typically this dish comes out with the cabbage leaves ready to fall apart rather than tough and requiring a knife to cut through. The stuffing of the roll also was very bland and my wife said that hers had an off putting smell to it. For us it comes down to: if you are going to advertise that you specialize in a specific ethnic cuisine, you need to be able to get the basic dishes right. Needless to say we will not be going back
5
We were two families and a friend and Buyan exceeded our expectation. Our service hostess Katia was has been the best female restaurant hostess I have ever experienced in Singapore. She was warm, smiling and extremely knowledgeable about the cuisine and what to recommend. And she gave her personal attention to us always bringing the dishes with a great smile.Ipad menu was so cool.One must try the caviar with blinis for the starter - this was an absolute divine. The caviar was fresh, smooth with a tinge of saltiness. Paired with flat crepe like blinis, and cream and sea salt was amazing. This starter is very light and luxurious, it would be a hit with couples on special occasions, business dinner or any caviar-lovers.Other not-to-be missed items are slow cooked beef stroganoff, authentic shashilik, and the honey infused cake with rasberry coulis will leave you coming back for more to Buyan
4
The iPad menus are funky, russian waitress is enchanting, superb dishes but cream on top is that orgasmic cherry vodka that would leave you speechless. try to go to upper floors as they play pop music at ground floor and that breaks the atmosphere a bit, russian music would make the perfect circle. A must try
5
We had noticed Buyan on one of our previous trips to the Duxton Hill area. Duxton Hill has so much to offer and after our first visit Buyan is right up there as one of our favorites. My husband is of Russian descent so we are someone opinionated about Russian food. It was a quiet night in the bar but our server was attentive and really helped us navigate our way throught the extensive list of vodkas. What else would you drink at a Russian restaurant! The vodka is served super chilled and was wonderful. We ordered pelmeny as it is one of our favorites and although the portion was small by our standard the flavor was outstanding. We would definitely go back to this restaurant

We seldom eat Russian food so it was a new experience for us at Buyan. Atmosphere is cozy at the 3rd floor and they passed us iPads as menu. We can preview pictures and read descriptions of the dishes. The food is delicious and has a homely feel to it except it is daintily portioned and plated.They also serve an extended list of Russian vodka

I visited during Restaurant week and was not terribly impressed with the simple presentation of the food. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful balance of flavors, and attentive service. The borscht was hearty and perfect for a rainy afternoon, and the meatloaf, crumbly on the outside yet tender inside. The highlight for me was the honey cake dessert - simply the perfect way to end the meal

I found the buyan restaurant very disappointing. My sister and I being of east European descent were very excited to try the buyan fair. We went for lunch. The waiter offered us iPad menu's, each item on the menu had its own photo and description - big mistake! We were told there was a two course lunch for $28 ++ or a three course lunch for $35 ++. I ordered the borsch which was very nice my sister ordered the pelmeni. I give the chef 10 out of 10 for nibble fingers which he must have to make the pelmeni so small. For our main course my sister had a lamb and rice dish so forgettable she can't remember what it was called and I had the cabbage rolls. And therein lies the big mistake. The cabbage rolls I had were nothing like the photo at all nor the size. There was no rice mixed in with the meat, it was not cooked in a tomato based sauce and I would have called it on the small side for an entree never mind a main, it was beyond disappointing. When I told the waiter of my discontent he was very sweet and served me with a desert of his choosing, on the house. I will also point out my entree $12 and my (mini) main $15 a total of $27 would have been cheaper than there $28 lunch time special? When I leave a restaurant I like to feel fed not fed up!!

We tried Buyan during the Singapore restaurant week when they offered a three course menu consisting of Stolichny (Olivier) salad, Beef Stroganoff and an apple puff pastry desertThe Olivier salad was ok – on par with what you’d get in a Moscow staff canteen. The apple puff pastry was of the same standard as you’d get for a few dollars in a Deli France. The Beef Stroganoff was the real disappointment. It was very bland - in fast almost tasteless. It felt like something served in a hospital or in the economy section of a mediocre airline. The key to this recipe is a thick sour cream the Russians call Smetana (more sour than regular creme fraiche/sour cream). It creates a wonderfully thick and slightly sour sauce. While obviously difficult to get hold of in Singapore, we often cook a descent version of Beef Stroganoff at home with the thickest, highest quality sour cream we can buy together with a hint of lemon juice for additional acidity. In contrast, the version served at Buyan felt just like beef strips with regular cream and mushrooms. The sauce was clearly sub-standard in terms of thickness and acidity. In addition, the second floor dining hall was lacking in atmosphere.We left Buyan disappointed and have no plans to return
