Must try: Crab beehoon. The succulent flesh of the crab just peel off the shell easily! Tender and juicy!
4
Cheaper than Uncle Leong restaurant. Location no Aircon. Food consider standard nice. Can use nets and credit card. No service charge so do not expect service
5
Staff were extremely helpful n courteous. Food was great. Ambience was nice. Cooling also. Easy finding restaurant.
4
The crab beenhoom and signature shimmering sand crab were very tasty. Crabs were fresh but not as meaty. The other dishes were not too bad but overall a little pricey.
4
A great place to have good crabs and food. Also, a suitable place for gathering as well! Would recommend to others.
4
Delicious food. Very affordable seafood compared to the more established chains. And the quality is still as good. The service was efficient. What more can one ask for?
5
Uncle Leong at this outlet doesn’t fail to deliver. The crabs are awesome, fresh and big. Price is also reasonable. Other seafood is also yummy like the cereal prawn and spicy Lala clams.
5
I arrived early but waited past my booking time.The friendly and cheerful staff with huge crowd served me and allow me to order while I wait.I was given the 3rd available table once the overstayed guest left.Managed to cut a birthday cake that night while it was packed until past 9pm.My booking was 8.30pm
5
Arrived about 6pm and we were one of the first few customers. Food was served in 10 mins and service good. Ordered salted egg prawns, 3 egg spinach, marmite chicken and crab beehoon and all turned out excellent. Total was about $120 for 3 pax. Definitely will return again
5
Restaurant is located in an isolated area of Toa Payoh. It is a good place to eat as there is no crowd at all. Service staff are good too as they will therefore have more time explaining the food and introduce their restaurant specialties.The Restaurant also accepts credit cards payments which is good for those who did not bring much cash. They should do more promotions and advertise on their Restaurant to bring in more business and air condition the place. They should also introduce more set meals and give free desserts like those other Cze cha stores around
5
This is my second time heading to this place for dinner. My family from Hong Kong really love this a lot too. The service was excellent. Food was excellent. I will definitely be back again.
4
This is my 2nd time to this restaurant and as usual I ordered their crab soup with vermicelli. It was filled with crab sweetness n yummy. Will definitely come again.
4
Fantastic crab Bee Hoon, English spinach with Abalone mushroom, Coffee Pork Ribs, Steamed red grouper etc. Good food at reasonable pricing.
5
Services are good. The food also good. The place does not have air con but over all still cooling. Will go back again
4
We ordered one 800g (staff say it’s small) crab beehoon and Medium marmite chicken for 3 small eaters.
Total cost about $90.
Second visit and order of same items. Love the sauce gravy of the crab beehoon!
Price not fixed so better to clarify upfront.
3
Somehow the quality of their famous crab bee hoon was just not as great. It is still good but not as good as I remembered. Poorer quality of ingredients or skill of chef? I can't tell.
4
Location was a little tricky to find. Coffeeshop setting but it was cooling at night and was not as crowded as expected. Ordered their signature Claypot Bee Hoon Crab Soup and Shimmering Sand Crab Delight in small size but turned out surprisingly big! SSCD was butter sauce with fried cereal on top, strong taste of white pepper. I preferred the Claypot version. Total bill was very reasonable. Would come back
3
we visited the Jurong branch and loved the food. Decided to try the Toa Payoh one. Located in factory area. Restaurant in a big space canteen.Crab was very fresh and we also ordered some other Zi char dishes. crab prices were not cheap. About $68 per kilo but the Zi char dishes was very reasonable
4
The place is look more like a hawker centre in the middle of business district - but their seafood is solid good !!! Ordered the Shimmering Sand Crab - the sauce is OMG !!! So good !!! I even mix the sauce with the rice and rice noodle ... super tasty and delicious !!! Worth to try !!!
3
We ordered the crab bee hoon, chilli crab and a few dishes. While the crab bee hoon was up to it, i cannot say for the chilli crab. at first bite, the sauce smelt/tasted fishy! i've never experienced that with chilli crab sauce! luckily the meat was ok and without that weird taste/smell; else i would have to speak to the manager! still, for the 'small' (the waitress said they only had small crabs) size, it's considered expensive. as for other dishes, nothing to shout about, some were a bit pricey too. i had heard of uncle leong from a couple of people who had tried their other branches. so i would say, i'm quite disappointed with this branch. maybe i'll visit their original ground if i were to give it another chance
5
Really enjoy and satisfied my dinner at uncle leong toa payoh. Good quality food with reasonable price. Thank you
4
Uncle Leong signature dish, I call it crabby soup. This is not to be missed when you dine here. Die, die must try! IMHO.
5
My 2nd visit to TPY outlet. The food is consistently taste good. Price is reasonable for this food standard. Yes will visit this outlet again.
4
my top pick whenever i wanted to have crabs as uncle leong is pretty decent in it's pricing and quality of seafood. most of the time i get fresh crabs with great taste and this is the most important point for me when having crabs
3
Ordered a Fried Mee Sua, Hokkien Mee, golden friend Tou Foo and a 3 eggs spinach. Other than the tau Foo, the rest are a little salty. Food is ok. Can be better.
3
Overall satisfied
Using chope booking make our dinner more convenient, especially we have a group of 10pax
5
The Claypot Crab Bee Hoon was fantastic: the soup was sweet and tasty. The crab was fresh. The Chilli Crab was also quite good.
5
The crabs were fresh and sweet. Other side dishes we ordered tasted very good as well. The price was very reasonable too.
4
Has the signature Shimmering Crab - not a fan of the sauce, but the crab was super juicy. Other food items was decently-priced, and of good quantity.
4
This is a place I frequent with my family. We love it because of the variety of dishes and the quality of the food. The service was great and the food was served quickly. My friends were impressed by the freshness of the chili crab, and we will definitely come back again
5
Crabs were fresh, juicy and fleshy! 6 ladies shared 4 crabs, 1 vege, 1 beancurd, just right! $50/pax. Recommended crab flavours: XO soup bee hoon, salted egg, black pepper
5
Excellent service, great value for money. The food was tasty. Decent place. Enjoyed our lunch there.
5
The food was fantastic. We ordered 4 types of crab and every crab was cooked well. The meat did not stick to the shell. Most impressed with the sauce. Definitely recommended.
4
Crab was good and fresh, but standard drop abit. Service was average, all servers were Chinese from China hard to communicate.
4
Crab broth was really good! But salty though. Abit pricey as each crab is about $70 each. The scallop in brocoli dish is very small
4
Came away satisfied once again from Uncle Leong crab beehoon soup. Fresh crabs, robust soup - what more can you ask for?!
4
Price is reasonable as compare to other seafood outlet and service is good and fast. Although in industrial park setting but place is clean and with good parking space.
5
Food was delicious! Order was processed promptly and we didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive. Customer service was good too!
4
When we go to Uncle Leong, crab is a must! We ordered 3 different flavor, chilli crab, butter crab and crab bee hoon soup. Those we like tofu can try their special deep fried seafood tofu, very delicious. Price is quite reasonable at $339 for 9 pax including drinks. Will come back again!
5
I have been here 3 times within a week. The crab in soup with noodles is so so so tasty. Try this dish and you won't regret! The black pepper crab is also very good. Much better than those high priced seafood restaurants in Singapore. Be prepared to wait for the food. No air-con in this branch. Definitely will go again
4
We had the crab beehoon which was good as usual. no queues which was awesome unlike the other crab beehoon joints where queues can be as long as an hour. spacious, good ventilation and lots of parking.
4
Been to other branches and amazed that they managed to maintain the standard at this branch too. Quality of the food is really good minus the waiting time for the crab.
3
Ordered the butter crabs which was good, especially the buttoler sauce which went well with rice. However we waited about 45mins before our crab was served
5
Service, food and parking were all good. Will return. Despite the crowd the service staff was friendly and smiley.
5
Surprisingly not many people on a Saturday night.. made it more conducive for chilling with friends.
5
Loved the chilli crab, sweet & sour chicken & soups they served! Liked the local atmosphere away from all the tourists.
4
Good for the price but the location has no airconditioning. An oldie but goodie. Love the beehoon crab and guinness ribs.
3
Afterall service and food was good! Waiting time for food was least expected. variety of foods is there.
3
First dish tomyam soup was a bad start! It was simply some paste used! We had 2 huge crabs (fresh but not sweet):when I told them we only had 4 out of 6 of us who eat crabs! They could have given us 2 smaller ones, which I was told by one of the guests that small crabs are usually sweeter!The cereal prawns were good
1
Was looking forward to the highly raved crabs and me and my friend actually cabbed down just for that. Reached before 7pm and ordered 1 pork dish and 1 crab. However after one hour, the crab dish still was not served. Many tables who came after us had already gotten their crab dish by then. As I started to get impatient, I tried calling for your waitresses but nobody actually bothered to attend to me. There was a really rude uncle who simply said "WAIT" and did not get back to me. I went to the counter after that to ask about my order and the same rude uncle just replied "I already asked them to cook now!" in a very irritated tone. Due to his rude customer service I cancelled my order and he simply said ok go get your bill... Therefore, my friend and I just left without eating any crabs.I have never experienced such lousy customer service in my entire life and I will never ever return to this stall again. Diners, please think twice before patroning this stall
4
Friendly staff. Service was good. But staff may ask you to order the more expensive dishes and order more than enough food.
3
Overall was a pleasant experience.
Food was alright but was on the salty side.
Service was okay, dun expect much.
4
We ordered a few dishes, the dishes were rather quick to arrive. Blachan KangKong was very tasty. The crabs were a little pricey and meat not as fresh as those at Mellben, but was alright. Overall was a good meal.
3
place all your order at 1 go, if not you'll have to wait a long time for any add-on orders. Ordered 3 crabs in total and the flesh of 1 (claypot beehoon) was not very firm. Best dish was the sand crab!
5
We had the crab beehoon soup, butter crabs, coffee pork ribs, signature fried tofu and 3 egg spinach and they were all so delicious. Great place for family dinner as we could make a reservation and there was ample parking.
4
Great ambiance and good food! My party of three totally enjoyed the Crab Bee Hoon, not only was the meat fleshy, juicy and sweet, the soup base was tasty and sweet too! Highly recommended!
4
Different take on crab noodles - wet or dry! Both were very good! Great to dine in groups to share!!
4
It's my first visit and I brought along some Indonesian friends who are crab lovers. We ordered crab beehoon and another signature crab dish in white pepper butter sauce with oat flakes! Both were excellent. Also had the fried small squid but found that too salty. in fact my friends thought it was dried salted squid! Overall happy with the food and the reasonable price
4
We frequent this place when we want crabs and to avoid the tourist type of restaurant. They have a good variety of crabs and our favorite is the salted egg crabs. We also like the standard chili crab and black pepper crabs. The shimmering crab is also popular at UL but not my type.Our typical order will include cereal prawns which you can ask to not have the shell, crispy baby squid, some pork ribs and of course some veggies.Better to know the staff and servers. They are actually nice once you get to know them so hope you get past first impressions Their prices have increased, crabs are not cheap but cheaper than the branded restaurants but definitely worth a try, come over
5
A friend recommended the place and among the numerous places I've eaten crabs at in Singapore ...this ranks as one of the best I've ever tasted. The shimmering sand melts in your mouth and white pepper crab is just so savory I cannot stop eating it! My goddaughter enjoyed the creamy butter prawns that she ended up almost licking the plate! Truly an amazing find and this will be in one of my top places to go to whenever I have visitors around!!
4
Both the Jin Sha Crab and crab bee Hoon are really nice. The price for the rest of the dishes are very reasonable.
4
V delicious crab noodle dish at a very reasonable price. Though there is no atmosphere but I will still return for the great food menu options at a reasonable price. Kudos to the team. Well done!
3
Ordered the crabs here and while they were nice, I've had better. The service was ok and the seating in the cool evening air is quite pleasant.
4
Food was good and value for money. Crowded and the place was purely functional. Service is there when you need it.
4
Good food fast service. Enjoy the dinner. The crab bee Hoon is superb. Enjoy the coffee spare ribs and fried tofu.
3
Our Reservation for 12 pax was given up after just 5 min, and without first calling to inform us.So we had to wait for the next big table to leave and be cleared up (which too a while because they were shorthanded). Overall service was slow, forgotten pepper crab!Food wise - the signature Hor Fun (Large Size) was really a Medium in other equivalent restaurants. It's not your regular Hor Fun with peppery taste, so beware if you are ordering this for kids. It became a disappointed as this was intended to be a staple for the non-spicy eaters and children.Pepper Crab - which came after the whole dinner and after reminder was the Best dish though.Crab Beehoon - was ok, salty though. Liked Melben's betterOther dishes - averag
5
There is nothing else like during into the middle of an industrial park to look for good food - There is just something that feels very authentic about it. This place serves god food because the food is very rich and just totally heart-attack good. They have the Uncle Leong yellow cruised crab. The crab bee Hoon in soup still has loads of rich Creamy soup - never had I had such a rich soup! There is this golden flake prawns which is like salted egg yolk and again very sinful. The eggplant and meat floss is excellent and no spongy taste like other eggplants. Everyone liked the seafood crispy noodles The list of food goes on!
3
So we had no signboard the previous night at the Esplanade, that was a bit average and will write another review for that too. This one was discovered by surfing the website and seems to receive an unanimous recommendation from the local crowd. Very much agreed that price was great, I.e. Excellent value for money. we paid <100 SGD for a great dinner for two.The black pepper crab was great and I would recommend that, my only critique of this place, is that, all other seafood dishes are not as good.
4
Food is delicious as usual, but one thing bad is there's food flies around our sitting area, quite irritating cos we could not enjoy our food in peace. But overall, the crabs was good, they are the best crab that among Singapore area, even though we have not visit Uncle Leong for awhile. Thumb up
3
I was rather impressed at the service level of the Punggol branch during CNY - it offered great flexibility and combinations of sets. Over here the service is rather lack luster and the service crew was not even paying the least bit of attention. It is terrible when you don't even know what is chilli padi? Moreover the food was a tad too salty. I chose Uncle Leong over Melben for mum's birthday but I now wish I hadn't. I doubt I would return to this outlet as I have better alternatives
4
salted egg crab was very nice, even though they ran out of male & heavier crabs, the meat was still quite sufficient. yangzhou fried rice was very fragrant.
5
As usual, the food is great and consistent. Service can be improved though for eg. changing small plates to big ones when crabs arrive
4
Their salted egg yolk crabs were the highlight of the meal. Other standout dishes include the fried baby sotong and tofu with mushrooms.
5
Other than their signature crab dishes, we also love the crispy fried eggplant. Our trips there have always been enjoyable.
4
Taste is just fantastic, not too salty and oily. Crab meat very fresh and juicy. Worth to come again.
5
Always love the crabs at Uncle Leong but first time visiting this outlet. The place is quite hard to find. And Google Maps directed us somewhere else. The restaurant is actually next to Nissan! Hidden in a factory building. But once inside, the experience was great! All the dishes were ordered were super yummy!The service tops all my other visits to the other outlets. The lady who served us was amazing! She knew what we wanted even before we asked!She even switched off all the fan around us when we were preparing the birthday cake. Very very very nice. Will be back

We had tried to book a restaurant for chilli crab but they were all booked so someone recommended to go to this restaurant. It was a little outside orchard direction to ToaPayoh. The first thing I saw was: the people eating there were all Singaporean, heardly see any foreigner. They told me that the food was not so expensive and the taste was very good. So I tried Chilli Crab and Prawn and Fish and.. Yes, they were very delicious. The palce did not very nice but the food was nice and cheap
5
To be honest, I found ULS via Mr Google. I was craving crab beehoon soup n having tried several other eateries, I wanted to try a new joint. It was a sunny n hot day and ULS @ Toa Payoh has no aircon. But it was not uncomfortably hot. My mum ( n my young son) and i ordered the signature crab beehoon soup in the claypot. Priced at $50, this is about the usual price for crab in a restaurant. Among the crab beehoon at 3 other eateries I've previously had in recent years, this took the top price. The soup was eminently tasty without the MSG, so I wasn't left feeling thirsty. My most severe MSG attack lefte with a terrible neck ache and headache. (For MSG sufferers, coca-cola is a good immediate cure - for me at least).The deep fried egg plant with pork floss .... da bomb!!!! It was so fluffy light that you could be forgiven for thinking it was something else other than eggplant. Everybody likes this dish.We also ordered black pepper venison which was yummy. As well as the 3 egg spinach in soup. Oh.... we also ordered the deep fried tofu - another feature-worthy dish.Aha.... we were kinda over enthused about the menu and ordered like 2 dishes too many for just 2A 1C! The bill came up to $105 Which wasn't so bad considering we had to take away half the beehoon. We rolled out of the place. Ever since that first visit in mid- December, I've been there a total of 5 tones in 6 weeks todate. Brought 4 diff groups of family and friends who in turn brought their family and friends. On the other occasions, we tried the chilli crab with mini fried mantou (sweet bread rolls); crab with pumpkin cream (yummy too) guiness ribs; coffee ribs; golden sand prawn (we requested for de-shelling).This last prawn dish.... fantastic! Shan't say more; you'll have to try it
2
despite making a reservation on the app, i was greeted with a full house on arrival at the restaurant on time. so, whats the point of chopeing?however, restaurant staff spotted a table that's almost done and prompted us to order while waiting for the table. this is probably the only saving grace.staff who took order really hard selled their dishes, telling us that the dishes we have ordered is not enough - my family members are small eaters, would I not have known?generally the food quality is average. but tad pricey
5
Love to buy back crab mee hoon for dinner. Very nice and convienent when order in advance and collect. My fav is actually the crab roe tofu soup. As for crab, crab mee hoon is most frequently order. Fav is salted egg crab. Butter and golden sand crab are nice. Chili and black pepper crab are with varying standard. The prawn are actually big and fresh as well.
5
family restaurant with big table, all the food that we order taste very nice.... especially the crab..
the size of the crab is bigger than usual size.
5
Very friendly service staffs at uncle Leong. Reasonable price range for the quality of food. This is my 3rd visit, will definely be back again.
1
Received several confirmation from a hotline & yet no booking at Uncle Leong restaurant. Pls look into it
3
We visited Uncle LEONG Seafood at Toa Payoh today and ordered the signature Hor Fun and Crab. The Hor Fun is not bad. But the crab is average in terms of taste. The gravy does not match well with the steam buns like the chili crabs' gravy usually does
5
Haha I could be too exaggerated here but all because I just had seafood in a bag of one of the fancy brand out there a day before I eat uncle Leong seafood. I know one is Louisiana seafood and one is Chinese seafood, they prices are also 1 time more expensive than Chinese seafood! I definitely prefer this cheaper and yummy uncle leong's seafood ever.We ordered one black pepper crab and one butter crab, additional of mantou(bun), homemade tofu, 3 eggs vege and dry curry leaf chicken. All are freshly cooked and delicious. Services are good and serve fast. Price are reasonable, at first I thought it will be $200+, but ended up $140 for 4 of us. $95 for 2 crabs that less than a kilogram. 1kg will be $60 for now
5
Bought 3 of my Thailand Friend for a dinner at Uncle Leong @ Toa Payoh,They was so amaze by the Pork Cube in Ice and they tried the Crab, It was so fantastic, they said even better than JUMBO and I agree with them. Reasonable pricing as well
5
Amongst all the "other" dishes that we ordered to fill 8 of us, the Crabs and Bee Hoon in Soup stood out as being the best feature of the dinner outing. The depth of the taste of the soup was great and addictive, next comes the fresh and meaty crabs, and last but not least, the bee hoon completes the great experience (and we did asked for the soup and bee hoon to be topped-up)
4
Set within an industrial complex, Uncle Leong has been my family regular seafood haunt.The prompt service delivery by the wait staff and the consistent great food are the two reasons for our repeat visit. Might want to make a reservation during weekends and be sure to have to wait patiently for the food during peak hours
5
A local friend of ours in Singapore took us to this restaurant. It was hard to find but worth the search. There was a group of 12 of us. We had a variety of dishes. The coffee pork ribs, lemon pork belly, chilli mud crab, tofu hot pot, water spinach with sambal, lots of other things. But the stand out was the salt egg crab with curry leaves. I think all up we ordered about six meat dishes (including prawns) and four crabs, bread rolls, beers, soft drinks, coconut water etc. The price was about $50 each and there was food left on the table. We were so full. Service was fast and the food was incredible. I would highly recommend this place. Great night! Best crab I've ever had in Singapore
4
Food was good. Had 2 crabs and a tofu dish, a vegetable dish, man tou and rice, amongst 4 people. Bill came out to be about 40 per head. Did not realize it was not airconditioned, not the best place to go during the haze, but good food more than made up for it.Had the chilli crab and golden sand crab
4
Had dinner here with some friends and ordered their pepper and chilli crab which is very good. Their pork ribs cooked with stout is very tasty too.
5
Had a great dinner with my brother that came back from Perth to visit us. Food serve fast, fresh and nice. Would be here for more gathering for sure
5
The food was excellent and parking was readily available.
The favourites are the salted egg crabs, chilli crabs, black pepper crabs, bee hoon soup and of course the pork ribs. Everything ordered was presented perfectly.
2
Waited 45 mins just for the dishes to be served. And the food was just average. Will not return again.
4
Had the chili crabs, salted egg prawns and 3 spice chicken. All tasted great. The buns went well with the chili crab sauce. Me and my friends walked away a happy team. A bit pricy though..
3
I used to think the crab beehoon at uncle Leong's was very good. But a recent visit changed my mind. The crab selected for me had recently moulted so it was really quite hollow inside. Ended up paying more for the weight of its new shell instead. I don't think you should select such crabs for your guests if you are running a restaurant. It leaves them feeling short changed. The food was also ok this time. Nothing great. But it could've been the occasional whiff of garbage from the nearby bin centre that tampered with the taste buds. Not sure if I'll return again.
4
Far from the glitzy downtown areas, this is in a housing estate. Taxi to get there easy, but taxi out is difficult.Friendly uncle and staff, good menu, buy and serve yourself drinks.Food on par with famous expensive places that us tourists go. Prices much more reasonable.Worth the taxi fare and hassle
2
Awesome chilli crabs at Uncle Leong's, definitely my go to place in Singapore for seafood, but service is absolutely horrible. Called in 40mins in advance to ask if they have female crabs and if I should reserve, but the guy on the phone advised me to just walk-in. When we arrived, we were informed they only have 1 small female crab available but we still went ahead and ordered it together with baby kailan, some fried buns and Gold Coast prawns. A waitress came back after 20mins to inform us they were out of female crabs so we said change it to a male crab. We waited 1hr and 15mins and talked to 3 people before they even served the baby kailan (which is just stir fried vegetable by the way), and another 20mins for the rest of the food. They're lucky their food is good but their service definitely leaves much to be desired
3
Uncle Leong's seafood in Toa Payoh is like a coffee shop style in an industrial area. In Braddell Tech... Probably was craving for some crab.. so had higher expectation. Had a treat from Boss at this place with the team... I simply love the female crab EGG.. high cholesterol.. but I have hardly seen much big egg for so many seafood place i visited... Crab Bee Hoon Soup - Soup is not bad, worth a try.. Order Chilli Crab too.. good to go well with the Bun, so dun forget to order bun when you eat chilli crab... A colleague came late and order an addition "Gong Bao Chicken". Nothing fanciful but was a little surprise when this dish doesnt have Cashew Nuts... haha...Some of my colleagues did not fancy this and preferred the other seafood place for crab in Toa Payoh... One of them even had a bad experience with the Punggol outlet though.Possible to try this seafood if it is near u.. but probably I will not specially go back once again even the EGG is nice
4
Uncle Leong's site at Toa Payoh may not be salubrious (it is after all, set in a hawker centre) but it has the best cooks of the three branches, IMHO. You can't go wrong with the chilli crab (with man tou), the black pepper crab, the Guinness pork ribs and the cereal prawns, which are my favourite dishes. Huge crabs and prawns cooked perfectly. Various other dishes available, like tofu and veg, quite good, but you'll only remember the crab! Be warned, though, it is quite expensive for where it is, so don't expect to pay hawker centre prices
