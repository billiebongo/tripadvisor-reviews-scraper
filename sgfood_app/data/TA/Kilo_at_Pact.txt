Strange place in an unusual location but liked the outdoor vibe. Menu seemed very limited at first glance but the board at the ordering counter had more detail. Food overall was good and the ribs deserve a special mention.

Good service. Fast. Reasonable price. Good food. Simple. The place hides in a cloth shop but easy access from Killiney rd. Just go up the escalator. The restaurant is there at the left corner.

I know they probably have reasons to create different menu for lunch and dinner but I totally hate it because the only time I can better enjoy my food is during dinner and I don't work around orchardHaving said that I finally tried their lunch menu and it's quite interesting especially the rice bowlsI think the best way to go is to mesh your food offering for lunch and menu that way, it gives people more reason to return than having to wait for a particular time of the day to sample those foodDinner menu is quite average. No doubt the selections sounds good but taste wise is quite blan

Tried Kilo at Pact and we were overall happy with the food.The salmon was great, very tasty. One of the salads we had was also nice. Service was efficient. Set up is on the hip side but attention to detail can improve in my opinion as we could see cleaning material (floor mob, water containers in corners of the restaurant).I found the price for mains a bit on the high side for the setup and quality of coffee was average but overall the food experience was very good.Would like to try one of their other outlets at some stage

The restaurant is best accessed via the side escalator between Orchard and Killiney road.Food menu is limited unlike its sister restaurant in Kallang. It is great if you just want to hang out for drinks and get a bite to eat. But please note that last order for food is at 9pm and the place is closed by 10pm.Food was well prepared and we enjoyed it. Portions are made for sharing and this is a plus when you are just hanging out.Service was great with friendly and helpful staff.Would recommend their seafood cerviche.

Was craving their quinoa salmon rice bowl which I had at lunch before, only to be told that rice bowls are only available during lunch. That is perfectly fine. However, the dinner menu also lists a pan seared salmon donburi dish. Donburi in Japanese means rice bowl... When it was served, it contained no rice..and the server told me donburi is sauce.. Please be more knowledgable in your menu item

Kilo at Pact is the perfect hippy place for friends and business colleagues to hang out. I was there with some of my business partners over lunch on weekday. The food is fusion combining Japanese, Vietnamese and western favourites eg salmon and avocado maki rolls, beef short ribs set and a variety of sushiros (chunky rolled rice stuffed with various ingredients). Very inspiring interiors with good food to match. A totally immersive experience at lunch

Great food, drinks and service. Staff was happy to fit us in, in this great atmosphere and space. Steak was particularly great!

Nice place for a quick bite for lunch or afternoon :snack". Just like the other Kilo restaurant fusion food of a high standard against a fair price. Down side, it closed at 6p

Love the decor and menu. Food was great too. Its a nice set up with a boutique that you can browse (while waiting for your food I guess??).

Check Kilo Pact out during lunch hour, and found out they have very healthy & affordable lunch bowls. The salad bowls which are called the shushiros serves with quinoa! Ordered the beef rib, it was good. It could be better if the beef is more tender.My colleague had the rice wrap, which i find it nothing to shout about. The rice is pretty plain with not much flavour accept when you bite into the ingredients.Topup $2 and get a soda drink & dessert. Pretty good value dessert for the price. We had the eggplant & tai truffle maki, it was really good. I believe the ala-carte menu items flairs better. Should check this place out in the night, they will have a wider menu to pick.The main outlet at Kallang has superb food too & more experience staff.

The ambience is simple delightful. My group was complimenting the venue, food and professional service. Kudos to the team, youguys really fantastic on the evening and handled everything so well. Squid ink fettucine: my favourite dish is beautiful and its an enormous portion for someone like me

I had the braised pork belly bowl with sushi rice at $18++, and topped up $5 for a lunch combo with a lemon pie in a cup and cappuccino. A regular lunch combo would be just an additional $2 for dessert and ice tea. This was a very tasty, and well-balanced rice bowl with options of sushi rice, brown rice or quinoa. Everyone at my table loved what they ordered.Love that it offers great portions of protein, veggies and carbs within a bowl - and all with amazing flavours.The coffee leaves more to be desired, but this is a place for the interior designs as well as well-curated food menus

Kilo is tucked right at the end of a cooperative group of clothing and bric-a-brac shops on the second floor of the Orchard Central shopping complex. It's quite hard to spot but it's well worth seeking out and you really should book a table in advance, even for lunch, because many locals have it firmly on their radar! You sit at stone tables or at the bar. The cuisine is best described as modern Japanese and it is yummy, especially if you have sake with it. We enjoyed the pork belly bowl, beef short ribs, sashimi and if there had been enough room I'd have like to try the pomelo duck too! There's an array of nice desserts and a good wine and beer list. Very enjoyable and not too expensive

I would say it's definately a good place to chill with friends over some beverage, but if you are looking to have a proper dinner, I am afriad the choices of mains especially on the menu can rather limited- would be good if you could check out the menu online before heading down...We were lucky enough to be seated at the far right end of the tall table and not in between 2 groups of patrons. Do note that it's a table sharing concept over there.Food wise, we spent over 70 bucks for 2 person - for 2 mains (pork belly & a pasta) and a dessert (Ice cream with choc lava cake) Their pork belly was really good and the pasta was flavourful though kinda plain - topped only with seaweed and wasabi sprouts. Their dessert was average, in comparison to many others which I have tried else where...The staffs were polite and prompt. Service was good

Bestie and I needed a quiet place to dine as we catch up after a fortnight not meeting up. We went to Kilo and didn't regret our choice.Their service was warm and prompt and our food was delicious

We each chose from the $20 per person lunch menu, which included an entrÃ©e, a dessert, and a beverage (coffee apparently doesn't count as a "beverage", +$3.00). I had the Smashburger Shushiro and my partner ordered the Beef Short Ribs bowl, with brown rice. Both were delicious, but hers takes the nod with tender, grilled beef atop corn kernels, pickled radish, sugar peas, and wasabi sprouts. Dessert was a small lemon tart and a basil panna cotta - both tasty

This restaurant was very good. We had been searching for something like this - good quality food, casual environment, with an interesting menu. There are not many places like this in Singapore. More of a "California" Asian Fusion, but very very good. Staff friendly and accommodating

I visited with work mates for a casual dinner and was blown away. Snuck away in a clothes store they serve amazing fusion food with fabulous staff to match. The eggplant is out of this world and the salt and pepper squid is not the average. I cannot wait to come bac
