The Dim Sum and Beef Hor Fun here are delicious, ideal for dinner/supper, but service can be a little slow.
3
Easily locate on Main Geylang road at Lorong8 corner. The restaurant has relaxing set up open-aired tables with picture menu we can order using number conveniently.
Food was quick and well served. Taste was standard for Chinese Dim sum for quick and budget travelers
3
We had 5 or 6 small plates of different foods and most were ok but nothing outstanding. Price was good. Service, well let’s just move on.....
4
The food was really nice. Delicious dim sum! Ghe service could be better, but it is still worth to go.
2
Their Seafoods dimsum has stink in flavor, their yang chow rice is okey and their pork steam rice also okey.
3
Most of the plates were good, run away from the potato cakes (a deep-fried bread casing with gooey liquid/mashed potato inside, yuck!), I managed to choke-down one bite from one. As others say, prices are not a deal or even a bit high for what you get, but the food tastes good (aside from the liquid potato things). The tea was excellent (milk tea, not the cheap China table tea)

My friends took me to have the famous Singapore chilli crab in Geylang. In fact, I had no idea of this place. I had no knowledge of this neighbourhood either. So my friends took us on a bus from Little India to Geylang.Mongkok Dim Sum is on the corner of Geylang road Geylang lor 8. Very easy to find.We had, of course, chilli crab with market price (S$50 for the plate). This was my very first chilli crab in twenty years! (I think I had once when I was a kid on a trip to SG back then). Anyway, the chilli crab here was finger licking good! Dip the fried mantou (bun) with the sauce and Mmm yum!We also had wok-fried sambal kangkong (morning glory vegetables), which was really good too. Kangkong is not my favourite veggie, but this one was too good to skip!The deep-fried prawn rolls (harguen) were average though.I think the food we had was pretty good here and the price was reasonable.It was quite late but still there were local people eating here.We took a bus back to MRT Bugis station later. So it was very convenient too.We did not try any Dim Sum items here but they looked good too. But good option for local place and local food

Varieties of Dim Sum. English menu provided. Higher price than surrounding restaurants but superb ! Same recipe as in Hongkong. 3 prawns in 1 dumpling. Super yummy. Everything is yummy. A bit minus score for influent speaking of English of the staff. Served me the wrong one

Just had dinner yesterday after not eating in Mongkok Dimsum for more than a year.Standard is still there. Love their Deep-fried Shrimp and Mango Roll. Porridge was smooth and tasty.Service is ok as long as I dont have to wait long for my food, I have no complaints
1
The service was horrible.We asked two beberages and food and we payed.But the waiter forgot give us the beberages. After 15 minutes, I remember it her and she gave it. When we had finished, three waiters told us that we hadnt payed the beberages. We tryed to explain that it already payed but they didnt believe us.At the end, one of them saw the bill in the trust and they apologiced.The food with little savour. And no healthy food.I dont like nothing. So sorry..

Been there a few times and I would say their
- food : nice...
- service : room for improvement!
- price : ok...
I probably wouldnt go back if not for the nice food...
2
Poor handling customer service even not really busy. That quite senior post lady very rude on her manner & treated me like I owned her money. Terrible service.
5
our favorite yang chow fried rice, siomai, dimsum, etc. English speaking staff. huge bowl of noodle soup.
4
This is a good restaurant to go to if you ate in Geylang area. It is open 24 hours and has quite an interesting extensive menu that is affordable. It is clean and airy. The chicken rice pudding comes in a large bowl of that is good to share. The dumplings and steamed rolls are also tasty. The place does a big take away trade
5
Walked over here at 5am due to jet lag. The dim sum is amazing. The place sits on the corner and looks like so many other places in this area. The price is about 3 - 5 Singapore dollars and they come in baskets of 3 to 4. They have a picture menu and the orders can be written on a ticket which is in English. Great place for dim sum in Geylang.
2
Arrived at this place for supper with the family. Food was ok but service was bad. Not too sure about the local customs but I had asked for a cup of hot water as a means to cleanse the exposed utensils. This incurred a charge of SGD0.20. The amount was not the issue but the principal of charging for this is what baffled me.Food was not bad but I doubt it's prepared hygienically... Just my opinion
3
Many times I went. The food is getting saltier, and MSG? The food is very very tasteful, all these while, yesterday we all feel it's too thirsty after eaten. Hope the owner will look into it, I always love this place. Good service, serve fast, fresh food, good egg tart!Generally the food we had here are too salty last night. Except, egg tart, Liu sha bao, chicken lotus leaf sticky rice and Cheong fun

if you have lived in Hong Kong and have a passion for Dim Sum this is the place to go in Singapore.The purpose of this this review is that I have been going to this restaurant for many years, and the food and staff standard remain at a high standard.The restaurant itself is clean and simple, it is the food the stand out attraction. All the Dim Sum dishes are prepared fresh on the premises. What ever dish you choose you will be disappointed. Try the dumplings, pork, prawn scallop for a starter. The mail course of crispy seafood noodle is a winner at just S$ 6.00. Cold beer is on the menu. To enjoy a full meal you should budget about S$ 20:00 a person, with beer. The wait staff are very heplful and the food arrives very quickly
5
We tried the spring eolls, fried prawn dumplings, fried rice, fried crab ragoons and steamed dumplings. Delicious! All for $31. Full for the rest of the afternoon. Great location! Although the numbers aren't well marked, once you see building 208, walk on to the next block. It's on the corner and you can't miss it.

It is located in one of those Singapore style coffee shops next to the main road that's called Geylang. It's not accessible by metro and you have to take a taxi there, or a bus which stops on the other side of Geylang and then walk through one of the side streets to this other side which is also called "Geylang"Interesting, the red light area is also there and you can see some scantily clad woman here and there at various lorongs.When I was there, it was quite deserted. I was the only customer. That was on an afternoon at about 3 pm so I am not sure if the crowds are usually to be found during lunch and dinner time.As dim sum prices go, this place is neither cheap nor expensive.The porridge came in a huge portion which could be shared by 3 to 4 people, if they are ordering other items as well. It would be good if they sell it in a small portion for one person. Also, I found the porridge to be too thick (too much rice) and not well grinded. It is not as smooth as those in Hong Kong. I had thought that this was a Singapore branch of a Hong Kong Dim Sum restaurant but it did not seem so.I also ordered some pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings. They were fresh and tasted good. The chilli which was meant to be a dip was wonderful.All in all, this isn't a smart place. Waitresses are not dressed in a uniform and they sit around chit chatting among themselves. Nevertheless, they are attentive and if you need to call them to come over, you just need to wave a hand.All in all, it's a pretty relaxing place for the customer with no specific dress code required

Great place to have a bite if you happen to be in geylang area or stay nearby.it's open 24hrs so anytime you can just pop by and have a taste of hong kong dim sum without bursting your wallet.recommend to all.
5
Place is open 24h which is good. We went there three times (2x lunch and 1x night snack). NYE night (3am) place was crowded and it took 30mins to get food but it was Ok. Lunch time food took like 5min and was always delicious.
2
Went for lunch today and was disappointed by the food. It used to be really good but not now. Maybe changed chefs? Not sure. But won't go back again I guess.
3
want eat Chinese Dim sum in the middle of the night go to Geyland .Dim Sum hot and fresh service fast .Try their lime juice .Sadly filling all prawn.They have a outlet in East Coast Road.But not 24 hrs.
4
A very light food to start the day at here. The food quality is really good and very light at stomach and also light at pocket too.
3
food is mediocre.
nothing extraordinary.
not a place you would go to a second time.
i don't like or dislike the place.
i don't just care for it.
3
The place located not far from where I stay, in the heart of Geylang district. It opens 24 hours so you can choose this place either from breakfast, lunch, brunch, or dinner. The menu was quite vary enough, although if you want to eat here then you must spend more than 10 SGD per perso

Mongkok Dim Sum has been one of the dim sum places that I always want to try it out. Figured to start by ordering 3 dishes to see how they were like.The Steamed Rice Noodle Rolls was the only one that worth to order. The rest of the dishes I must say it was very salty. My mouth got pretty thirsty even after drinking quite a bit of the water, so you know what it meant. Tons of msg.Personally I won't bother to be back again
4
Geylang Road have different restaurants but Mongkok is my favorite!! They're open 24 hours! Lucky for travellers like us who would end our day late because of our non-stop Singapore exploration. It is very easy to order in this restaurant because of their order slip and complete menu with number for each item.I love their three-colored milk tea!!! I always order this with any meals.. Their cold milk coffee is also delicious! I dont need Starbucks or McCafe here in Geylang.. ;)All their dim sums are delicious!! My favorite is their shrimp dumplings or Ha Kaw..
2
I ordered for carry out and ordered wrong item, due to language. I paid for the wrong items too, it was fine, I love dim sum.I said Ha Gau, for 2nd time and I saw the receipt, it says Fried, I corrected her, for steamed. She got furious and just ignore me and decided to keep my change.Very rude lady despite my politeness.Food is so so and variety of dessert is limited to only Egg Tart.No push cart, only made by order, so order your food at same time, and expect a 20 minutes wait for steamed buns
5
We had the pork and prawn momos, sugar cane juice and black pepper beef fried rice. Everything was excellent and very very cheap. Very good place to have a relaxed dinner!
3
We came with a group of friends at 10pm, not very crowded. Outdoor sitting was great. Enjoying the food, the breeze and friends chatting. It open 24hrs. Good place for supper. The toilet is the only thing i dislike.
5
that was one of the best places to get east Asian food , I and my wife went to that restaurant again this year due to the clean tasty and reasonable prices in Geylang
4
Good value for money.
Try the salted egg custard bao, you zhar gui wrapped cheong fun, har gao and tri colour tea (gula malaka iced milk tea)
4
On the busy Geylang street, this is a good place to experience the large dim sum menu. The staff are quick and efficient; the food is tasty. What more do you need?
5
Most Hong Kong/Malaysia alike dimsum in Singapore! I personally prefer this one than Wan dou sek @ geylang and also the big brand THW. Hong Kong Zhu Cheong fun is so good. Siu mai is fresh, chewy and juicy! Some special dishes are interesting and nice too like paper curry roll! Yam pastry with meat filling is good but inside is white not those like char Siew bao ya!Would like to try char siew bao, salted egg yolk bao next time, their fried rice smells enough wok hei from the next table.If you like milk tea, must order 3 layers milk tea! This is the smoothest I've tried here in Singapore ;

i liked the food here. as i have traveled to China before, i know about Chinese cuisine. the staff speak English and Chinese and the service was quick. you can't order food to the waiter but they give a pen a paper to write down your order from the menu (traditional Chinese way).
4
This is a covered outdoor, relaxed, but clean restaurant on Geylang Road. The menu has a good selection and the ordering process is easy. I tried rice rolls with prawn (Chang fen) steamed shrimp dumplings (hawgaw), and sticky rice in lotus leaf (nuò mĭ jī). Before digging in straight away, suggest waiting a minute for the rice noodle to evaporate any excess moisture as this will ensure that it will not fall apart when you pick them up. Good taste for the money. Also a great place to people watch. Will come back again.

If ever we were in Singapore again, Mongkok dim sim would be our first visit. They, the food were so good, so yummy and had so many varieties. We ordered a lot from the two sides picture menu and still hadn't cover them all.Every single dish was good to very good. Only the fried soft shell crab was below average as there were too much batter, a bit oily and not much meat. But we also knew this was a hard dish as the meatiness of the crab depended on the season it was in. But why dwell on it while the other dishes were so delicious still making me dripping thinking about them.We went there using a direct bus from the bus stop next door to our hotel in Bras Basha, alighting near the restaurant 4 mins walk away, and the bus stop on the return trip was next door. Very convenient, very modern, in air con environment and plentiful and the trip took about 15 mins and it costed $1 SD/person/trip (cheaper than in Adelaide). You might want to invest some of your time in investigating bus routes, stops near your hotels and those attractions you want to visit. Your return is huge. The same for the Singapore mrt.BTW how many digits a chicken foot has? We had dim sim chicken feet in Chinatown in Australia and elsewhere and thought there were 3 digits each, but chicken foot in Mongkok Singapore had only 2! Were we shortchanged or the chicken in Singapore were different to those others elsewhere in the world? Or we were wrong somehow! Still wonder? Well maybe not a bad reason to revisit Mongkok next time round

When the top two dim sum shop closes. This is the one i would go (usually on tuesdays) if i have a dim sum craving. The liu sha bao is quite good and yummy and the price is quite average for a person. i would also recommend the zha-liang. A good place to chill when you get hungry at 2,3am for no reason
5
While working in Singapore it was hard to find a place that would serve a good meal in the middle of the night. Mongkok was great. Very fresh and nice dim sum.
5
super mama-mia delicioso. must try singapore chilli crab, fried rice, chee cheong fun, and dim-sum off course.
4
Tasty and quick Dim Sum place in Singapore with less of a wait time than other joints. Also the price is more affordable. Recommended!

In finding food it's not necessarily means to dine in a resto or eat in classy night dine in. It's about classic approach of appreciation and chooisng it on the right place where foods were excellent and nice. I love there ginger frog and used to order it as often I visit them. Can eat all one bowl! Not hungry ho! Just love its spiciness.

We visited Mongkok's brunch at East Coast Road, opposite Katong 112. The store is very clean and casual. The ladies running the store are efficient, fast service and polite. There's more than a hundred dim sum menu items plus Cantonese dishes to chose from. The dim sum is refined, well made with quality ingredient. All the dishes came freshly steamed. There are hot, with traditional favor and great mouthfeel. The chopped vegetables stuffing are crispy and tasty. The frog leg porridge is great if you are into such dishes. Highly recommended for a quick bit of satisfying Dim Sum if you are in the neighborhood

It's a humble restaurant at a corner of the street. The place is quite clean, simple as disposition. To order the food, there's a menu with number and pictures so that even my 3-years old niece could choose what he want, you just have to write all the numbers you want and pass it to the caissier, and you'll be served within 5-10mins. There's dim sum, har gaw, bun,...for 3-4 dollars each dish ( 2-4 piece/dish) and also porridge ( must try the "3...crab porridge" ) and yangzhou fried rice, and all is just delicious, especially the dim sum. The drinks is not special but the price is affordable. When you travel, sometimes you find a restaurant that makes you wanna go back just to try out every dishes on the menu, this is definitely one of them

My mouth watered as the steamer baskets opened and I saw the fat pork and translucent shrimp dumplings in front of me. And my taste buds were not disappointed. The juices burst from each dumpling as I sank my teeth in, and experienced the wonderful chewiness in each bite. No dim sum meal is complete without the two of these, and they were done to perfection at Mongkok Dim Sum in Geylang. What a great way to start a Sunday!Teased by these dishes, I had to try more.The prawn chee cheong fun lived up to its name, with each wide strip of rice noodle rolled to resemble the small intestine of a pig, but thin, elastic and slippery, containing a generous prawn filling, and coated in a warm, sweet, soy sauce. The breaded chilli crab was a unique touch: fried bread stuffed with spicy crabmeat - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And to finish off, my favourite, the cha siu bao: freshly steamed buns containing a tender, sweet barbecue pork filling. Yum!With over 50 dim sum dishes to choose from at an average cost of only S$3.50 a dish, I could have sat there all afternoon, eating and watching the crowd go by... if only my stomach was big enough!For information on other dining options in Singapore, see http://singaporehawker.wordpress.com

I remember paint by numbers as a kid. Here we have a restaurant that copes with the language barriers by offering choice by numbers. Look at the menu pics, correspond that with the order form and your food arrives. The dim sum we sampled included the house special prawn dumpling (good) shanghai pork dumpling (good) Phoenix prawn (good) breaded chillie crab (excellent) paper wrapped curry chicken (excellent). I would happily go back for more but the beers were far too war

Excellent people-watching corner, fresh dim-sim, ice-cold beer. Nothing was soggy or stale. Kitchen staff and servers and cashier were all hard-working and pleasant, even if English was minimal. Lots of places, the pictures on the menus are nicer than the final product. At Mongkok? It is just the opposite - often the food was more generous (esp. the plated dishes!) than the pictures.The only thing lacking was the atmosphere - it is an older shop, so don't expect a fancy carted service on faux velvet chairs here. This is decidedly more Hong Kong style dim sum than fancier upscale yum cha.Quality dim sum? Wide selection? Good service? Triple check! :

Place is not diffcult to find, and staff were friendly, unlike some dim sum staffs at other places, whom are less friendly than usual. Food wise, they are not stingy with their ingredients, such as prawns, crab meat etc, and furthermore, the meat were fresh! I especially love their 3 yolk crab porridge. They open till 5am which i think is great for late night suppers. I think they are better than those dim sum places i have been too.
