Was recommended here to try the barachirashi by a friend. $17.60 nett and it included free-flow buffet (not many dishes), ice tea and water. Portion size was sufficient. But thought it could be better if the rice had less sauce and sashimi slightly cold.

I got the unli side dish option for about $17.5 sing. But I suggest you go for ala carte since the chirashi bowl is loaded with lots of salmon, so its quite heavy but yummy.

Love the Japanese food here. It's a nice quaint restaurant hidden on the third floor selling quality rice bowls.

The daily special of barachirashi with butter grilled salmon at $19.80 is good value - a generous portion of fresh sashimi (salmon, tuna, scallop) and a good chunk of grilled salmon. Otherwise, a rather limited menu. Ambience-wise it's nothing to shout about, and for the most part it is self-service (drinks, cutlery)

The restaurant is ran by the wife of Teppei-san, the man behind the well known Teppei Japanese restaurant in Orchid Hotel. The restaurant was located at the second level, on top of Super Star 3, a Korean BBQ restaurant. Here one just order at the counter and find your own seat. Only NETS and cash is accepted here. Similar to other outlets under Teppei, it also offers Barachirashi. But that is where the difference comes in. With each order of main course, one could help yourself to the various side dishes on the counter.As it was Wednesday when I visited the restaurant, the daily special was Barachirashi 7 colours ($24.80). The usual barachirashi topping, aburi salmon, crab claw, negitoro, scallop, salmon roe, tempura crumbles, on top of sushi rice , with fresh wasabi. The serving looked small in the big bowl, but it was quite filling. For side dishes, there's braised chicken with vegetables, Kabocha Korokke ( Japanese pumpkin croquette), Kakiage, miso soup, DIY salad, egg mayo, pasta , Hijiki (brown sea vegetable growing wild on rocky coastlines around Japan, Korea & China) No Nimono, kinpira (burdock root cooked in soy sauce), miso eggplant, marinated bamboo shoot and tea. As it was is ladies night, one could also enjoy a free drink after a bowl of main course. However I was too full and forgotten about the free drink

It is very good value compared to other restaurants considering both quality and quantity. The Chirashi bowl keeps me happy the whole day with its generous fish slices. I did wish though for the rice to be warmer and some freshly grounded wasabi. The air conditioning didn't seem to be working well when we were there, so I found myself really warm shortly after ordering and payment. As for access, the cafe is located three flights of stairs away, so be prepared to work your way up, there is no lift.

An authentic establishment -- totally reminds me of Jap restaurants run by friendly and young Japs in Tokyo.Initially my plan was to visit 101 Tanjong Pagar Road for Tendon (tempura + rice). There was a queue, so I decided to skip that and head over to Hanare (99b Tanjong Pagar Road). At $17.50 nett with free flow tea, side dishes, soft boiled eggs and miso soup, I didn't even need dinner that day. However, note that the restaurant is closed on Sunday, and between 2.30 to 6.30 pm on other days

The food taste is super good and with the free flow of side dishes (like ebi fry, potato croquette, seaweed, tofu, pickles, miso soup, etc) and green tea - the price is value for money. If you do not like the main course of fresh marinated chunks of seafood, you can also order katsudon, tonkatsu, karaage as other options. Place is small and air-conditioned - be early to avoid lunch crowd

Very relax Japanese cafe at Tanjong Pagar area. Food is delicious and not pricey. You can order a main course and feel free to take the side dishes which they have cold tofu, miso soup, salad, seaweed etc. Self service for water & tea. Limited seating capacity so must go early. Overall yummy !

Staff is polite, chirashi don is reasonably priced ($17.60) and tastes great! Sashimi is always fresh during all my visits there. I brought more than 5 friends there, and all of them love the chirashi don! The place offers free flow wasabi, yuzu pepper sauce and other condiments!Other types of food are of average quality though- curry katsu don was rather salty, while buffet food was not outstanding.
