A restaurant hidden away from the outside world. The choices of food served during dinner was really good. My favourite dish was definitely the soup served before my meal..superb

Having a company lunch buffet gathering in this restaurant recently. Unique way of presentable the meals, similar way of Nasi Padang, but serve the dish by order.

We had a farewell lunch at The Rice Table. It was authentic style. The waiter and waitresses are not very friendly. Service need to improve. Food was good and we enjoyed with good ambience!

Dinner buffet, Indonesian style you can top up any food you want, total around 20-21 small dishes u can ask for topup but drinks is additional charge, very nice , the satay, otak-otak, egg tahu is superb

I went with a group of 10 pax on a saturday afternoon. We were utterly disappointed with the service. The service staff rarely communicate and kept forgetting our request to top up food. All food was served cold except for the rice and tahu telur. They didn't have the authentic indonesia taste. The grilled dishes and satay lacked the charred texture and taste. They seem like they were baked or microwaved before slathering with a dark sauce or peanut sauce. We ordered 5 portions of chendol. The gula melaka syrup tasted very burnt sugar taste to it. They might have over caramelised their syrup till it burnt. My entire group of 10 pax certainly did not enjoy the experience

My son found “the rice table” on the internet when scouting for indonesian food. We all love this cuisine and were looking forward to dine here.Unfortunately it was a massive disappointment. The gentlemen of the staff were non-communitative demonstrated by a frosty reception and difficulty to connect during the dinner.The food was authentic however cold. The flavours did not come through in most dishes as a result. Some dishes were clearly not fresh indicated by dryness. When passing the kitchen I observed waiting staff handling food with their bare hands. All in all my wife refused to eat here for fear of food poisoning and my son and I trued a few dishes. I have never written such a negative review but this is a geniune experience and I did want to let you all know to avoid disappointment

Visited here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. I found this restaurant online while searching for Dutch restaurants in Singapore, now that I’ve visited i wish i had never found it.First of all, please be aware as soon as you get seated they start bringing you food. The only food option is a buffet (which the staff top up for you) so basically, as soon you walk in and get seated your locked in to that restaurant as the foods on the table.The staff were very bad. They did not say a single word when they brought out the food, they did not seem even a bit interested in. They stood around watching the restaurants patrons eat while they had nothing to do.The food. It was cold. Looked old. It seemed to me that none of it was fresh (except for the rice which was actually warm :). The food at least didn’t taste horrible but I wouldn’t call it nice.When paying (20minutes after we entered because we didn’t eat much) i could look into the kitchen and i saw one of the staff (not a chef, a waiter) use their bare hands to move food around the plate, their bare hands.I was excited about this place but sadly have had a terrible experience

1) if you plan to dine-in, please secure your seat first. The restaurant has very limit seats and most of the time it full.2) Small portion buffets, I love the ayam kicap, and satay chicken. Oh not to forget they have chicken soup as appetiser. 3) Located in International Building, super easy to find.4) The ambiance- I don’t really like it, too noisy for me. If you are looking for private or calm lunch or dinner.. I don’t think this restaurant is the answer.

Has went to this restaurant with work colleague, didn't know it is a buffet restaurant until I saw the menu. For buffet wise the varieties are not that much though, however the restaurant is crowded with people during lunch time. When we start ordering the food, the staff just say they will serve all the food on the menu as we got 8 person. Food serving is fast, food is very nice. I liked especially the tahu goreng, satay, grilled chicken and the mutton rendang. Food is not that spicy and meat is quite tender, i love the peanut sauce for the tahu goreng and satay a lot. Thereafter we also ordered a durian chandol, nice and not too sweet. For buffet price in Orchard area, considered very cheap, but Indonesia food is very fulling thus cannot eat that much. Highly recommended

Went there for my friend birthday. I did not expect too much as I understand that sometimes the indonesian foods in Singapore is influenced by the malay or indian foods.To my surprised, at The Rice Table, the foods are quite authentic, except the satay, otak, chicken curry (got a lil bit of Indian spices i guess). But I can tell you that their Rendang, lodeh , ayam masak kecap & the rests are superb!!
1
My clients and I had never met a bunch of waitresses more rude, uninterested and unprofessional. To say they had horrible attitude was an under statement... I was so embarrassed in front of my clients. Food is average, please think twice before visiting.
5
Excellent little restaurant which serves the original Dutch "rijsttafel ". A large selection of small Indonesian dishes which taste delicious. Slightly difficult to find on the first floor of The International Building but well worth to look for.
4
Rice table serves authentic riftafael style of food. 20 dishes and free refills makes it very good value for dinner.

To familiarize my boyfriend on Indonesia cuisines, we thought it'll be nice to try the Rijstaffel, an array of small plate dishes serve altogether.We opted to try this Rice Table restaurant since it gets good reviews and food seemed in a decent portion. We made our reservation and after a few detour, we finally found and arrived for our set up lunch. The place is inside an office building, which is why it took us a while to find it. The restaurant ambiance was pleasant and kind of romantic, really. The service was quite prompt and efficient. The brought us two sets of small dishes which were quite vary in taste. The waiter came around and cater to you whenever you need extra rice :) All in all, it was pleasant experience, and we get to try rijstaffel without the fancy price. Will definitely go again with friends, as value was pretty decent

I went for lunch on Thursday. The tables were almost full . They accepted reservation. Even though the restaurant is located at an old building , the ambience is clean and cosy. It cost $18.95 nett excluding drinks and desserts . There were 14 dishes to choose from . White rice was also included . The dishes were authentic and tasty. I did not feel thirsty after my meal. I particularly like the Tahu Telok, Sayur Lodeh (Vegetables in Coconut Stew), Sate Ayam (Satay Chicken), Achar Ketimun (Pickled Cucumber). The Rice Table is a good place for friends to hang out for lunch , without having to pay through the nose for decent food . I will bring my friends next time .
5
Tasty food and sufficient variety for all you can eat. Particularly liked the beef rendang - the meat was tender and the curry not overly spicy. The cucumber salad was refreshing. Another favourite was the tender and flaky fish, in crisp and light batter. Very good value for money
4
When I enjoy good food, at least to my taste, I just want to say a few words. Lovely Indonesian food and the ambience is also good. Not a large restaurant so maybe a reservation may help. I cannot recall if they do take reservations or not bu no harm trying with a phone call. Parking is a challenge so I parked at shaw and walked. Hopefully, this will improve soon.Will I go again? Yes! And will bring friends too. Nice place for a small celebration with family or friends. Service is also good. Hope you will try this place out too

Visited this place more than 5 years ago, and thought to try it again last week since it is still around and wanted my wife to try out some Indonesian cuisine. Food wise, was a good experience, although the tahu telor was erratic. Our 1st plate of tahu telor was perfect and delicious, our 2nd order for it was extremely oily, the amount of oil was quite shocking, with a good few table spoons of oil pooling in the plate. The waiters were extremely poor. Considering this is not a self-service take-your-own-food buffet. We called many times to get our 1st servings of rice. It took SO long to come, we were 3/4 done with the dishes when the rice eventually arrived. Took so long to take our repeat orders. No apologies from the wait staff, no one cares. I must say that they were never rude, just plain indifferent
5
Ala Carte Indonesian buffet. Serve with rice and about 10 plus side dishes, chicken fish beef/mutton kang Kong prawn and sotong and a few others. Fast serving once seated. No ice or warm water only sold drinks however first dish is soup. Environment Is good for Frens gathering. About 30 per pax.
4
A neat little restaurant tucked away on the 1st floor of the International Building next to the Thai Embassy on Orchard Road. We arrived at opening time in the evening and were the only ones there but others started to arrive shortly after and they were all locals which is always a good sign. We were served quite quickly and although the 20 different dishes were small we didn't finish all of them so it was plenty of food. Some of the dishes are spicy but not too hot. If you like, or want to try Indonesian food at a very reasonable price this is the place to go in Singapore
5
Not bad! Keep up the great work. Will definitely coming back soon. Thank u so much for great services!
Recommended place to visit.

Last Ristaffel was eaten in Amsterdam a couple of months ago. This one is far superior with a wider selection of dishes.
We shall return.
3
Indonesia food with lots of variety, recommended to come and try. Quality is average. Service is efficient and good...
5
A little challenging to locate but well worth finding. All you can eat Indonesian food and every dish was delicious. Went taking three friends and was not disappointed. Food was not too spicy but just enough. As soon as 1 plate of the 20 delivered was empty they replaced with the same food and every time the food was hot. The plates on the table sit on a warmer to ensure they stay ready to eat
5
On of the great Dutch foods is the Indonesian Rice Table which was introduced by the Dutch in the times of the Dutch Colony time of the Indonesian archipelago. Found this place on Tripadvisor and it is my favorite place to eat when I have just arrived in Singapore! There menu is extensive; rice table and no more. Rice table brings you a all the great foods from Indonesia on your table; little places with delicious food! It is a little hidden in a shopping center, so just walk down the corridor and take the escalator which will bring you directly in front of the restaurant

went in a group of 5..wow..its amazing food. the concept makes it such a tremendous value for money...variety, taste, quality, service...Superb.how come I never knew this place before..what a gem.superb place to go as a group and really enjoy..great for celebrating occasions..ITs in my RED diary of foodie places.
4
We were looking for an authentic Indonesian rijstafel & found it here, with apparently endless refills of a wide variety of dishes. The management could help customers & themselves by training staff to introduce & explain individual dishes: the menu recommended starting with the mildest & working towards the spiciest but there's no indication of what each is.
3
Never visited the place for at least 3 years. Food was not as good as before. With 19 items are quite reasonable. Staff served all the 19 items without even asking whether anyone don't eat beef. Staff also didn't offer to take the drink orders till we asked for it. Service was not fantastic but one of the Indian girl was very attentive. She has been serving with smile but the rest ......
4
Loved the meal here, great value for money, just would have been nice to have some more explanation & service from the staff. Give it a go though, you won't leave hungry! Oh yeah, last point but ice water should really be for free in SG
5
Restaurant prolly need to do some touch-ups on walls and ceilings for ambience sake but if it's the food you're only interested in - hands down it is always consistent, never once it fails me and never will I ever forget to recommend to friends and colleagues.An authentic Indonesian cuisine that is intelligently served in portions so that food wastage will never be an issue, offering a variety of dish to tantalize your tastebuds without stopping you from indulging on the ones that you got hooked on.One of my preferred dining venues be it solo or in a group
4
Went with a group from work, In a small mall so don't expect views or great decor. Overall the food and service is great and the value is there.
4
Pros:
- Very affordable
- Food was delicious
- Halal food
Cons:
- Require more staff to help with food serving
Conclusion: Its halal, affordable, buffet and delicious. What more can i ask for.

I Like this restaurant, like dinner in my home. This restaurant serve Indonesian Food. I recommend you to try this restaurant

I've been here a couple of times, and the food has never disappointed. So when my husband and I were looking for a venue to have a thank you dinner for our family and overseas friends after our wedding, we decided to have it here. We made a reservation for 21 people, and they gave us two tables. Everyone liked the food (especially our friends from overseas), and the staff were good enough to accommodate all of our needs, even though we were such a large group. It was good for all of our guests, who had differing tastes and requirements - some of our friends didn't want spicy food, others were allergic to seafood/nuts, others wanted spicy food, etc, and everyone was satisfied. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a venue for a large group, or even a smaller group. Price is also very reasonable, which makes it good value for money
4
Haven't been to this restaurant in a long time but it surely didn't disappoint. The dishes were as good as before, very tasty and real Indonesian fare, not Malay or Padang as you normally will get in Singapore.Ofcourse the big attraction is that you can unlimited re-order the ones you like best as long as you finish it.The ones worth mentioning are the beef rendang, ayam kecap, ayam curry, sate and both the acar and rujak buah. But then again taste is personal...And I did miss the gado2 but with the spread offered it was compensated well
5
Our lunch at The Rice Table was a special experience – a great way to try small dishes of many different Indonesian flavors. They serve all-you-care-to-eat “set menus” of 14 lunch dishes for S$17.90/person and 19 dinner dishes for S$28.50 – a real value for this quality and authentic flavors of food. Our meal included: Javanese Chicken Soup, Vegetables in Coconut Stew, Beef Rendang, Curry Chicken, Ladyfingers (Okra) in Bean Sauce, Curried Tofu, Chicken Satays in Peanut Sauce (we had a second dish of these – the sauce was divine), Kangkong Belachan (stir-fried spinach with chilies and shrimp paste), Otak (spiced fish paste in a banana leaf), Grilled Chicken, Fried Sweet and Sour Fish, Tahu Telor (bean curd omelettes), Pickled Cucumbers, and Indonesian Fruit Salad. The servings are small enough that you can actually eat all of the dishes, and you may request additional servings or deletions of any of the dishes – they just ask that you not waste food. Located at the top of the escalator to the second floor of 360 Orchard Road’s International Building (a small building located between the Shaw House and the Royal Thai Embassy – take the Orchard Road MRT stop and walk through the mall following signs to Shaw House), the 54-seat restaurant itself is simply and serenely decorated. Dishes were served on a candle-powered warmer in the middle of our table, so foods stay warm and can be eaten at leisure. Service was attentive but not obtrusive. A lovely dining experience that we would highly recommend, especially for foodies who want to savor a wide-range of Indonesian specialties
2
I was very disappointed. This was my first bad experience with TA recommendation. We arrived at 6:30 for our reservation. The food was not hot when served and none of the twenty or so dishes were noteworthy and several were just bad. The service staff were not friendly and did nothing to encourage our understanding of a traditional rice table. Bad experience overall
4
A friend who lives in Singapore took us to this resturant a few days ago.Its inside a small shopping centre on the first floor.Its a all you can eat kinda style but the food is brought to you in small Indonesian style dishes and is kept warm on hot plates on the table.You get to taste many different Indonesian style food and you are served a plate full of rice to accompany it.The style is quite basic but the food was very tasty indeed with only one dish out of around 20 dishes that i didnt like.I had 2 beers to wash it down and overall it was quite enjoyable.Fot the 4 of us the bill came to 150 Singapore Dollars.The one lady waitress was very nice
5
Its an Indonesian restaurant, in orchard road. I liked the food , almost all the dishes are delicious and have a touch of home made food. Fish & Non-veg dishes are really good balanced instead of spices, I felt south-indian influence in those. Overall Loved it! will go back for sure :
3
Had Buffet ala carte Lunch with my colleagues. Food is ok, what is quite wanting is the selection of food and some of the dishes the amount they give is extremely too little, example, there was a 6 pax, the dish is exactly 6 small pieces of it. When I mean small is really small, the total amount on the dish looks like only a quarter filled.Some more, the music they select, its a bit too loud. For the environment is too enclosed.
5
Especially loved the tahu telur and rendang. Though there were a few dishes that weren't as nice, you can order as much of those favourites as you like.
5
We knew the place was a good place to have dinner when we saw it was packed with locals. We had the Traditional Rijsttafel, Rice Table consisting of 18 Indonesian dishes. The food was delicious, we enoyed the sambal belachan, rendang and the different vegetables. Service was a bit slow because the place was full. Recommend if you want to try some Indonesian dishe

We went here for a dinner during our business trip and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. There is such a variety of dishes that they place ont he table and you can quickly request more of any that you particularly like. Service wasn't top notch and not very attentive but once you got their attention, you immediately had what you needed.For the amount of food it is, it's great value. Think it was about 29 SGD per person for dinner.Also, we were a group of 8 so I had called earlier in the day to book a table which was no problem. If I hadn't of booked, I don't think they would have been able to accommodate us as they had another large group, so if you are thinking of going with more than 3 or 4 people, do try and book!The restaurant is in a mall, so not the most scenic of settings, however there is a good atmosphere in the restaurant
5
The dishes were really flavourful without them being overpowering. Had es chendol and every mouthful was a sweet symphony in my mouth. I esp love the sambal belachan kang kong. Portions were just right. You may call on the ones that u really like for additonal helpings. Staff on duty was immaculate and great. Will definitely come here again

In fact, I have been to a much better Rijstafel restaurant in Amsterdam, but never got round to posting a review on that one.This place was ordinary, certainly nothing special. The restaurant is rather cramped; I suppose management wants to pack 'em in as tightly as possible and maximise revenue at the expense of customer comfort. Service was very ordinary. We had the set dinner for 28 odd Singapore dollars, including a soft drink (beer was extra at a somewhat pricey $8.25 a glass). The food was OK, but not at all memorable. The usual dishes, rendang, brinjal, satay etc. were all there served on a plate of plain rice. Restaurant furniture was rather spartan and in need of replacement or refurbishment, I think.Good value for money ? No, not really. Given what one can find in the local cooked food stalls, it was all a bit too dear. About $15 would have been acceptable

We had been in several Indonesian restaurants in Europe and Asia before and we were therefore interested in trying this one in Singapore. Unfortunately this decision turned out to be one of the worst gastronomic experiences ever. Firstly, we were attended by an extremely unfriendly staff: in the 20 minutes that we sat at the table, we were not even asked whether we wanted to order something to drink. We were then served a vile chicken soup followed by a selection of lukewarm and smelly little eats that seemed to be the leftovers of the past seven days. The atmosphere was so unwelcoming that we decided to pay the bill and try some other place. Very unpleasant
3
A good change to taste Indonesia cuisine and a nice choice for dinner or lunch. Despite a buffet, all the dishes were served by their staff. All the food on their menu were served orderly. And...it is still on a basis of eat as much as you can. Dishes were small but you might ask for as many times as you want.Maybe I am not a fun of Indonesian food. I personally felt the taste was not quite impressive, and the price for dinner was a wee bit high (of course, it was located in Orchard Street. Location might justify the price)
4
We had a dinner here and tried the "Rice Table" which is a selections of 'little eats'. Extremely tasty. Admittedly the restaurant does not have an incredible atmosphere but like so many smaller type restaurants in Singapore the aim is to eat and enjoy good food. We ate and we did enjoy it.
5
Went to the restaurant many times when I lived in Singapore 10 years ago- and nothing has changed. Amazing value ($14 for lunch- unlimited food) for Orchard Rd, super tasty and fun. Set buffet brought to your table so you can sample more than 10 dishes. Highly recommended
3
Was told it was good - food and service and ambient. But found it average. Probably high expectations. I like their Buffett style though. They will serve you all 20 or so of their dishes in small portion. You can later choose to top up any dishes you like unlimited. Prices are reasonable.
4
We wanted to go a dinner date. I managed to contact a friend who works there to make a reservation. The Indonesian food was tasty and served warm. It's buffet style and the 19 different types of Indonesian food served on the warmer.
5
This was one of our favorite meals in Singapore. Fantastic value, food was Out of this world!! Make sure to try the fruit, fried tofu and satays.

Read mixed reviews about this restaurant but since I live nearby, decided to try it. Echoing some other reviewers, I would say that this is a "very limited" buffet. Owners of this restaurant control cost by controlling portions. At an Indian buffet for the same price ( Riverwalk Tandoor, for example, or the Yantra at Tanglin Mall), I could serve myself as much or as little as I wanted. At The Rice Table, this is definitely not the case: chicken satay was served to me in single sticks of 3 or 4 pieces. In theory, I could re-order as much as I wanted but after the third "refill" (= third single stick), waiters became "harder to find". I would not recommend this restaurant and obviously, have no intention of returning. I think a price between SGD$5 -10 represents the "true value" of this place
1
Before this visit to Singapore, we wanted to try a Rice Table. We met up with our friend who is a local, he had heard some bad reviews about this place, but we decided to give it try since we like Indonesian food. There is no resmblance to an Indonesian rice table. The price is cheap but that's all it has going for it. We had an assortment of dishes like satay chicken , rendang, but we could not bring ourselves to order seconds, even though it was a buffet.Food was cold or lukewarm when it arrived. I'm sorry to say, but there are other placesto spend our hard-earned money
5
This was my second trip to this small quiet restaurant. I knew when I returned to Singapore I had to eat here again. The food was exceptional again. They keep you stocked with so many different foods. I highly recommend this tiny place if you want exceptional food and service! Call ahead because seating is limited!
1
We had visited the restaurant on 18 Jan 2013 for lunch. There was a total of 14 of us in the party. We made prior reservations and was given a table upon arrival.It was a a la carte buffet lunch which cost less than S$20 per person which is pretty cheap considering it's a buffet. However, there are only 12 dishes or so available and drinks/desserts are charged separately.We ordered one of each dish first as we wanted to try what's nice and what's not. The dishes came pretty quickly the first time and three sets of each dish was provided. Till this time, we were still pretty happy with the place as the food was not too bad.Sadly, that was the end of the good experience and everything went downhill from there. We had liked the chicken satay very much but the portion given was quite small - five sticks per dish.We told the waiter that we wanted to have ten more dishes of the satay, given that there are 14 of us and the satay was really good. When he first heard our order, he paused and told us that we will be charged for wastage. We were fine with it as we are confident of finishing the food. However, he flatly refused to take the order and gave us the blank look until we reduced the order to five instead. At that moment, some of us were quite upset because this is supposed to be a buffet. Restrictions on amount of food is unheard of unless it was make clear from the beginning.After the waiter returned with the satay, which took 15 long minutes to be served, he stayed away from our table and refused to come near even when we needed to order something. What followed was worse - we tried to order a few more dishes, beef rendang and more satay in particular. Our orders were taken by another server, and they took a whole 45 minutes to arrive. While waiting, we ordered drinks and desserts (charged separately), which were served in a flash.We were really disappointed by the experience and will NEVER return to this place again. At first glance the price may be cheap, but in the end we could have gotten more if we were to go to another place, given the long wait for food
4
My husband and I ate here on a recent trip to Singapore and thought it was great. What I loved most about it was we were the only foreigners in the restaurant which made it truly feel like a cultural experience. It was a bit of a problem finding the place but once we were there boy was it worth it! Small bite after small bite of delicious Indonesian goodness! and Unlimited! You can eat your heart out here
5
I had heard about this place from a friend. After a short notice for a reservation, which is required, we arrived for a great meal. It is a small place tucked back on the second floor. We ordered the our dinner. It is a set dinner listed with 19 items. It is set up in front of you so that you can taste all the different dishes. Everything tasted wonderful! I am allergic to fish so some different dishes were brought out. Sarah and the rest of the staff gave us impeccable service. We plan to visit next time in SG.
4
Went there with 3 other friends for the lunch buffet. The spread was as varied as before. The last time i visited this place was more than 5 years ago. The satay was very tasty. Tauhu Telor was good too. The lime juice was good and is unlimited serving.For a net price of $20, it is definitely value for money
2
After a call to arrange my table, upon arrival I was told that they did not accommodate anyone dining alone except at off hours. Having chosen this restaurant based upon Trip Advisor reviews, I feel I must let you know that I was refused service here because I was "solo". Perhaps their website needs to state this clearly so that others do not waste time and taxi fare to get here, then be turned away
