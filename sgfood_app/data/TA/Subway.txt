My option to kill hunger during my veggie days :)
Veggie delight, tuna , chicken tikka are good options to with. Service wise all outlets in Singapore which I have visited are good.

I love this small subway shop. The service is fast and they have lots of promos coming. The service is ok and customer is always their priority.

This has to be one of the smallest and narrowest Subway outlets that I've ever visited. Compared to it's neighbouring stores at the mall, it's literally like a hole in the wall with just enough seats for less than ten customers. Nevertheless, the folks who run the place make up for the lack of space with good friendly service. The sandwiches aren't bad either, and the wall menu provides useful (though limited) nutritional information. Naturally, that's good for health-conscious customers. But the best place is that it's an affordable way to get a meal
