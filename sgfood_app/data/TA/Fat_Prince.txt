Went there for lunch and was blown away with the portions and the food. So much so, went for dinner with a group of 10 and equally had a great evening.
5
Food was excellent, everything we had was so tasty. Delicious cocktails and 5* service all lead to a great night. Highly recommend
4
very good food. didnt know turkish food is so good. All of us enjoyed it very much. Will definite recommend the plac
5
Prior to and after my dinner at Ottomani I had a few drinks in Fat Prince and was impressed by the overall ambiance and service. I didn't have a chance to taste the food but what I saw being served out it looked quite tasty. I'll definitely be back for a good night out here and look forward to trying their Middle Eastern menu
4
Nice variety and the Hummus and desserts were really good. Recommended to come here for dinner/drinks.
4
Had a very good meal here. The food was tasty and the portions generous. Service was and attentive and what's great is the staff are able to make recommendations unlike many places that will just answer "it depends on you"

Went there with my gal one Friday night. Tanjong Pagar was bustling and Fat Prince luckily managed to get us a table for 9pmThe place was small and intimate, with great decor. Loved the ambience. Staff were helpful and friendly, making useful suggestions and recommendations.Pork kebab, fried cauliflower and the hummus are a die-die must try. The pita bread is amazing too.Downside: Me and my girl didn't like the signature cocktails very much.... too floral for our liking. It was like drinking while being in a poorly ventilated scented candle factory. Maybe I should have gone for the non-floral infused classic cocktails.
4
Place seemed rather dark which I guess is the intended ambience! Food was really yummy though portions of kebab were small. Friendly service too. Will visit again
5
Amazing service, beautiful cocktails, food was yummy and unique. Makes me feel healthy eating them :P
5
I was on the way to another restaurant but the crowd and ambiance in Fat Prince looked more interesting so decided to give it a try instead. I was traveling and dining alone and I didn't have a reservation, so I took a seat at the bar and ordered the hummus starter and then two kebabs (halloumi and chicken) with a glass of white wine. All the food was delicious and they took steps to accommodate my 'no coriander' policy. I was going to call it a night after that as I had a flight in the morning to pack for...but the cocktails on the menu sounded so good that I thought about sticking around for one. And then two! The bartender, Sara, was very cool to talk to and he ended up creating two drinks for me that were not on the menu. And they were delicious (loved Mezcalized Gin)! Thank you, Sara! Overall the vibe in the restaurant is busy and fun. Lively but not distracting and it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves whether they were there for a meal or a drink. So glad I changed my mind at the last minute and decided to pop in. It was a good way to spend my last meal in Singapore

Was lucky to bump into this place.
For coffee lovers a treat. Sat here in the quite hour of their morning for some work. Lovely atmosphere and staff. Cool place lovely bar
Try it!
5
We had a delicious dinner here. Ordered several dishes twice. The sharing concept is good; portions perfect for 4 people. The personnel is friendly and quick and the ambiance is just lovely. Really would love to come back here.
4
Menu is original and varied, food tastes excellent. The place looks very classy and stylish - such a shame that it was so cold (we asked the staff to lower the aircon but it still felt like we were dining in a fridge)
5
The food was delicious and the service was efficient and friendly, recommended for couples and groups of friends.
5
It was a great evening. We enjoyed every moment. The food was delicious and just the right size. Recommended
4
A lovely evening with a group of four in this very popular and very busy restaurant. With the place full and the music quite loud it was difficult to hear what people were saying at times!We had a selection of mezze to start, four or five dishes, all very tasty well presented and we really enjoyed them. We then each had one of their signature kebabs, lamb shoulder, which are pretty small but actually it was enough for us all. We thought the service was good, friendly helpful and efficient. A couple of bottles of wine and as usual in Singapore the bill was heading very close to $500. I’m still struggling to come to terms with the expense of dining in SGP but what to do!
5
The food here is incredible. The service is okay, but not amazing. The ambience is also trendy and fun
5
This place is a real gem for authentic middle eastern cuisine in the heart of the CBD in Singapore.I have eaten several times here, both lunch and dinner, and every time have had a delicious feast! Definitely, try the halloumi with pomegranate seeds, but really everything is delicious, including the warm, freshly baked flatbread.5 stars
5
The food really exceeded expectations. We went for the kebabs, but the salads were amazing. Highly recommend the “Thai Bouleh”
4
Great ambience for a quiet meal to catch up with friends. We were mostly vegetarians for the day - we orderd fried cauliflower, falafel, haloumi kebab, quinoa thai bouleh - all these were amazing, worth a try!We ate the lamb kebabs - great taste. The kebab portions serve one person so order accordingl
4
This place keeps the cool , great atmosphere, fantastic and competent service and attention , great food with taste and flavour, great for couples, friends and groups , will be back
5
Food quality and service at its best. A bit pricy but you get what you paid for. I was taken good care of Shalom. Very good recommendations on the food and cocktails. Will definitely come back again.
4
The food is really good and new to us because we are not familiar with the middle eastern culture. The service was impeccable. But the price is a little steep for even middle class S'poreans.
4
Food was excellent, and the interior of the cafe was opulent and stylish. Service was generally good, except that one particular waiter was a little too eager to clear our plates.
5
Service was good and the ambience was awesome ...great place to dine and relax...should visit here often with friends and colleagues
5
Nice ambience and the cocktails were nothing short of perfect! Kudos to the bartender! Would definitely recommend this place for a nice chill out session :)
4
Turkish food with a mod twist and a nice vibe in the dining room. Second time eating the set lunch and it's consistently good. Will be back again soon guys - keep it up
5
This spot was recommended as good value and good fun. It is both and more. Visually appealing decor. Great vibe thanks to friendly staff and terrific music at just the right volume and beat. Simple but tasty middle eastern menu. Limited but sufficiently varied wine list. We had a delightful waitress, Monica, who could speak to both the food and wines. That helped guide our starters of superb hummus (to be expected in a middle eastern establishment) and grilled cauliflower. Then the kebabs of haloumi, lamb kofta and pork belly. All with delicious accompaniments that provide such a taste sensation we forgot there were condiments to enhance each further. The kebabs come lying in pockets of pita bread. Quite filling, but good to have if you want it and easy to leave if not. We had a lovely albarino white wine, something you do not often see. All round clever restaurant and bar with a good night out feel and most importantly tremendous value for Singapore.
5
Visited with my wife, had the beef short ribs, a bottle of Riesling, numerous glasses of their sea rize cocktail, as well as a few appetizers. The manager here, Mr Daniel, was accommodating and welcoming. The staff were also very warm and friendly; they stopped by to wish my wife happy birthday. Overall very delighted with the experience and had a wonderful night.
5
Sunday brunches in Singapore have become a little routine - the usual eggs, bacon and sausages done up in different ways. Fat Prince makes a serious effort to make a difference to this with unique dishes, and succeeds! The lamb menemen was my favorite - and the scrambled eggs main dish was great too. LOTs of options for vegetarians. Great cocktails, drinks and coffee as well. I went on a Sunday, and was back there for lunch on Monday, and dinner on Wednesday. A bit excessive, I know, but it's honestly a great place. Must mention - there's a "secret" bar at the back called The Ottoman Room - that's next on my list to try
4
The ambience was nice and cozy. The drinks were marvellous however, the food choices were a little too limited.
5
Top notch service by the crew, they notice small issues and clean up immediately. Nice food at a slightly pricey level. You'll enjoy the atmosphere.
4
Food and cocktails did not disappoint though Fat Prince should be careful of their service attenders if they want repeat customers. (One waiter had bad b.o. and it was very off-putting!)
4
Good - Food, ambience, attentiveness of waitress. Bar staff were excellent.
Bad - No champagne glasses or ice bucket holder. Perhaps a little short handed/new staff
Ugly - Had to wait about 40 minutes for our table.
5
Go and try the paper aeroplane and I promise you will not be disappointed. Lovely atmosphere, great fir pre supper drinks
4
The place and atmosphere is enchanting. Service was very good. Food was tasty and healthy but portions smaller than we thought. About half the usual kebab size! So, one person needs 3 kebabs to fill up. Caution!!
5
A lovely place with great ambiance. A lot of effort has gone into the look of the place and it seems to have worked. Cocktails are to die for! (Especially the raki ones). Food was good but nothing extraordinary. Overall a great place for dinner and drinks
4
Ambience excellent , superb service & food v good.Only criticism is the main course kebabs are tiny & I mean mini size . Would be better recpricing & provide a full size portion in my opinion? Excellent quality just tiny portion.Mezze to start was superb but I really feel considering we had 3 bottles of wine , the overall bill for 6 was just under $700 surely the extra pitta bread we asked for could have been provided free. There just wasn't enough to accompany the mezze for 6 of us.
4
Stunning place with great food. Buzzing with activity during lunch time so not a chance of a quiet conversation if you're looking for one. Portion sizes were small.Tabouleh salad was fresh and ful of flavour. Went with the 2 kebabs set, and chose prawns and duck. The prawns were divine. The duck was slightly dry. Rounded off the meal with the turkish coffee (fragrant), and the pistachio latte (very, very good)Will be back if I'm looking for a light lunch
2
Sunday : I went here for brunch with a colleague and found the food astounding ( mushroom egg cheese dish ). The cocktail list was phenomenal. The Turkish coffee decent. The ambience is stunning. Weekday ( 11:30 am ) : I went here for lunch and found the menu disappointing. For salads and small kebabs, the price was too much. I also found the lunch menu to be very limiting and meagre. I would expect the lunch menu to be varied as it is high lunch peak hour for business folks. The service was good but I did see a few bar tenders on their phone behind the bar. I know that it wasn't busy when I entered but to see bar tenders, texting on the phone, at such a beautiful establishment with boxes of drinks and equipment on the side of the bar, unpacked, is not very appealing. The music also did not match the ambience ( Top 40 pop songs that were being played loudly ). Perhaps, getting a specific sound track that matches the ambience ( Classy lounge-ambient music that exudes " French-Turkish Orientalist " vibe would have done the trick ).I will give this place a 3rd chance : Perhaps during dinner time at The Ottoman. If prices don't change a bit for the amount or quality of lunch provided, I can see this establishment floundering during weekday lunch whic defeats the purpose of it being a " cafe "
5
Delicious food with great atmosphere! Fat Prince provides a little bit of all, while also giving you the opportunity of trying several "Arabian tapas"!!
5
This is the 3rd time I've dined at Fat Prince. Service and food has always been fantastic! We've tried everything on their food menu and honestly, you can't go wrong.
5
I will totally recommend this place to anyone who likes flavours. They have really good salads and kebabs. The service was really great. Kudos to the management team.
5
Awesome brunch and I am going back - tried pretty much everything and its high grade and good value.
5
Went with friends a fair few of who are vegetarian - lots of choice and very tasty vegetarian food. Loved their water deal $1 for still or sparkling free flow. the lamb kebabs were excellent.
3
Had brunch at Fat Prince, interesting menu, unlike the usual stuff, good portion, could even share the main as we ordered the side for sharing! Great choice if one like Turkish food.
5
A number of things stand out in the Fat Prince. The friendly service. Modern takes on classics such as tabbouleh (using quinoa instead of bulgur). Tastefully charming decor. The lovely variety of the coffee & tea menu. All of which makes for a unique Middle Eastern dining experience in Singapore. The only obvious limitation is the choice of desserts
5
Ordered all the 6 kebabs. Unfortunately could only eat the chicken, the cheese n prawn adhana (coz I am Muslim and must eat halal). So yummy n flavourful My companions had the beef, lamb n duck n enjoyed those too. Looking forward to going back there again when all the meats are halal. We also ordered the potatoes n hummus appetisers. didnt try the hummus coz of the duck fat but the potatoes were spicy n da bomb!!The pièce de résistance was the out of this world halva pudding!!!! Just worth the calories!
5
We had a wonderful meal in the Ottoman Room, I highly recommend the lamb, and a delicious dish from the trolly, which was a strained Yoghurt with Honey and nuts.We were told the mains may come out staggered, but we didn't wait too long at all.
4
Stepping into Fat Prince feels like stepping into a different time and world. It is a beautiful bar. After a long day at work, I felt somewhat 'rejuvenated' when I entered the cocktail bar/restaurant. Their yummy Middle-Eastern inspired cocktails did the trick too. Price-wise, they score high on the value-for-money section. With the happy hour prices, 2 starters (hummus and cauliflower) and 6 kebabs, the bill came up to just a little over SGD40 per pax (there were 3 of us). Pretty reasonable!I'd highly recommend the Roasted Cauliflower. It comes with a dip which wasn't necessary as the cauliflower itself was delicious on its own.Kebabs-wise, I'd go with the prawn and lamb kebabs. Those were, in my opinion, the better ones. We tried all 6. The service staff were attentive and very prompt with refills of water and answering questions. The restaurant also has a nice little CSR initiative where they donate the SGD1 that you pay for water (still/sparkling) to charity.This venue is great for intimate and cosy catch ups with 1 or 2 friends over cocktails and nibbles. If you are ok with small bites for dinner, then this is the place for you. If you prefer a fuller dinner, check out The Ottoman Room which shares the same space
5
Nice atmosphere with beautiful interior. The quality of food is relatively good too and the prices are reasonable. Chef Hunter has done a fantastic job. Service is excellent.
5
Having grown up in Dubai I am very picky about any food Middle Eastern! Did not expect such vibrant flavours with the right pairing of ingredients I have not had the chance to try! Highly recommended! Favourite plate - the ribs!
4
Great ambience, excellent brunch menu with free flow, top notch service - go for a relaxed lunch or late dinner
4
Highly recommended. Service and food are really good. Nice atmospher, wasnt too noisy. My friend and are had a good time
1
Hummus was awful and the chips were old. Eggs and sausage over cooked. Best was the sparkling water and wine. Ok service
3
I had heard a lot about this restaurant and was keen to try it out. I went with a couple of guests visiting Singapore. The food was average, the potato appetiser was overcooked, the hummus quite tasteless but the cauliflower was tasty. The kebabs were ok but nothing special. The waiter that was assigned to our table didn't really give us time to breathe before asking for our order. He was not at all subtle with his service and actually was an irritant to our dining experience. Overall ok but would not recommend or go back when there are so many great places to eat elsewhere.
2
We had a reservation that was confirmed verbally with the staff and yet, when we were finished with dinner, we were told that our table was booked for someone else 45 minutes later and we needed to leave. When we didn't leave straight away, we were reminded 2 more times - both 30 minutes before the next "reservation." It seemed as if they were kicking us out. I would not have had an issue if the restaurant had told us either when we made the reservation, when we confirmed the reservation with them on the phone or when we arrived at the restaurant. It's a little late when a waiter keeps asking you to leave. We were not offered coffee/tea, dessert or any other service at the end of our meal due to the table being urgently needed by someone else.
5
We went to Fat Prince without planning and just showed up - they treated us really well and seated us at the bar. Food was really good, and they have a variety of well made spices and dishes that mix up contemporary and middle-eastern food and we just loved it. Aside from that, service was absolutely fantastic and the staff is GREAT! Recommendation goes to everyone, with any level of intolerance or allergies, because they adjust very well
2
This is a great location for a restaurant, and the interior design is warm, nice and comfortable. But... the food is awful. Really. Everything is SO salty!!! The potatos, sliders, everything. I think the chef needs to do a tasting check with his clients.My friends walked away not happy with the food, but happy with the atmosphere and service. If you're coming to this restaurant you will need to have a few more glasses of water for sure
1
I would not recommend ordering here via Deliveroo - the restaurant may have a nice ambient but ordering the quinoa bowl with one kebab (total roughly 25 SGD incl. 3.50 delivery) is way too overpriced. Taste is okay but it looks pretty sad when some (can kind of count them) quinoa and a not even 5 cm long little piece of Kebab reaches you. Sorry - that was nothing ---
5
The food was good, ambience great. Small portion size, which I think can be improved. We went to celebrate my husband's birthday and they knew that, but there was no acknowledgement of that. So that was a bit wierd.
2
Wished the quality of the food is as exquisite as the setting of this elegant restaurant. Such a shame.
5
Service was good. Appetizers-Cauliflower and falafel were delicious. We Tried 4 kebabs and all were great. Cocktail was perfect.
3
We actually had a good time visiting. The servi I ce was very good and the ambiance was cool, but the food and wine was only average - although the prices was on the high side - especially for only average food and wine.
4
good food. nice ambience. decent service. a tad expensive given the small portions though. overall would recommend this place.
4
Fat Prince does a modern play on middle eastern food. Some of the changes work well especially with the lamb and the shrimp kebab. Some less so - didn't understand the point of the truffle oil baba ghanoush - the flavours tend to be antagonistic rather than complementary. Again - why add duck fat to hummus? The kebabs are delicious and are priced at $8 each - however they are tiny and you need 3 per head. The room is rather small but has a great vibe and the services was great.
5
I ve been here twice, for my birthday celebration and with my colleagues. The service is one of the best i had in Singapore (wish usually the service is horrible everywhere), the place is super stylish love the music, the lights, everything lovely! The food is delicious and healthy, they have options for vegetarian people wish is not easy to get, and the price is also good, the starters are from $10 to above, i would suggest to order a couple of starters (tabule salad is my favorite, potatoes, hummus, falafel mmm everything is good) one kebab for me is enough. The first time i stepped in this place was in the morning, the smell of the coffee dragged me in, i also recommend it.I hope if you you enjoy it like i did, cheers!Si vienes a Singapur y quieres comer en un lugar con servicio y precios accesibles, te lo super recomiendo, la iluminación, música y decoración de este restaurante es bellísimo, sinceramente los precios son muy bajos en comparación de lo que el lugar aparenta. La comida es deliciosa y tienen varias opciones para gente vegetariana. El café es riquísimo también aún no pruebo el postre pero próximamente vuelvo a ir y les aviso, provecho!
5
Fat Prince opened a few minutes from my house, but only ended up going last week. Great deco, suitable for a date dinner, or a meal with friends. Mezze dishes come in a cart, and you can make your selection right then and there. Good take on Turkish/Lebanese dishes. Bread: underserved. Water: over-served. Give it a try, though
3
A great ambience with friendly attentive service. Love the very interesting and eclectic drinks menu. Food is limited in choice, but generally good quality (loved the quinoa, sausages). However, vegetarians are slightly stuck for choice. They have the very interesting and funky Ottoman Room open for dinner. Looking forward to trying that!Pricey
1
We went for a brunch costing SGD 79 (without drinks) and the 8 eight of us got 8 dishes in total. 4 of them were potatos and eggs. I assume in ordering such a plat "a la carte" in any 5 star hotel/restaurant we would have ended up with a total bill of around SGD 200. Fat Prince charges us SGD630. About the same price was charged for free flow (prosecco, red and white wine). Avarage to low quality and quantity was more than disappointing. For such a price, you can really enjoy the best of the best with the Singapore 5 Star hotels! I will definitely never go back there
5
We were looking for a good Turkish/ Middle Eastern cuisine in Singapore for a very long time and finally we found it. Food is an excellent modern interpretation of the cuisine. It is pricey but delicious. Restaurant is quite small, service very frienly. Highly recommended.
3
It was alright but quite overpriced. Just the word Kebab by nature has to also look and taste like how it sounds so anyone expecting a big juicy Kebab will be dissappointed. The taste though of the mini Kebabs were not bad.
4
Good food. A bit expensive and not a great deal of quantity, but good quality.
Great alcohol and beverage selection
5
This cool place is the perfect restaurant to bring friends for a great night with good food and drinks.
The place has a cool vibe, and is the perfect venue for a group of friends, but even also for a date night.
5
We are from america and had a friend recommend this restaurant. The food was incredible! Bartender was knowledgeable about cocktails and incredibly friendly. Host (Sam) was beyond hospitable, had a smile that could light up a room and gave excellent recommendations for places to go.
5
The food is of great taste. The staffs are very attentive. I will recommand the prawn and cheese kebab. Also the fried califlower.
4
We at here as part of a ladies' night out and it was a cool atmosphere for the occasion. The service was friendly and efficient and all the food we ordered tasted great, although the portions were small for the price. The staff also tried to be accommodating for a friend who had dietary restrictions. Would recommend this restaurant for diners wanting a cool atmosphere with middle eastern cuisine
4
Modern interpretation of a kebab house with mains served tapas style. Dishes like houmous and Baba Ghanoush can lack flavour at many restaurants in Singapore by afar Prince has nailed them. Full of flavour and texture, excellent paired with the falafel. The salads had lots going on and each mouthful offered little gems of flavour. The lighting is sombre so it's difficult to see clearly making the tasting experience a revelation in every mouthful. Kebabs are very small, imagine a tapas plate. One finger sized portion per order, prices sort of reflect this. Knowledgable staff who are eager to advise on wine choices. Long sharing table initially put me off but was actually not noticeable once I got used to it. Overall, fresh, funky take on the usual middle eastern staples with a great atmosphere. Cafe style kebab house but at restaurant prices. Not a cheap night out but your taste buds will thank you.
3
Food was good, meze really excellent, main courses pretty average. The variety and taste in the meze was excellent, but the lamb shoulder and rib mains were not to the same standard. Wine list was not great. Tried two different wines, neither particularly good and all a bit expensive.Service was alright.Didn't much like the ambience. Front of the restaurant is very loud and the back very dark. We needed the phone torch to read the menu.Overall expensive, but OK. Not good enough to go back
3
Went there for breakfast over the weekend. I was not impressed with the service. Even though we were one of the 3 tables there (and there were 3+ staff), I felt like I was never able to get the attention of waiting staff when I needed something. The food was delicious (though some dishes a bit spicy for my liking).
5
Tried the baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, honey chicken kebab, halloumi kebab and homemade soda - Turkish tea with ginger. Simply excellent!
5
Food is great and wine list that they have definitely complements well with the food.
Don't leave the place without trying the Turkish Delight! All of us had a wonderful time due to the excellent service from the staff and of course, the lovely ambience!
5
You can enjoy a very good drinking while you're tasting some delicious middle oriental food. Environment nice and good music.
5
We had a really great dinner at Fat Prince, nice lively ambience, perfect service and top class food! Highly recommended!
4
A fab concept for dinner, with potentially a great sensory explosion. Great taste, great ambience, great feel and touch with the plush decor, the only real let down is that the restaurant (back of house) is way, way tooooooo dark. I, and at least two other tables were using their cell phones to light up the menu, and with food tasting so delicious, its a shame that you can't actually SEE IT!! In fact it detracted from the overall experience, the lighting isn't really right. Sadly no photos of the food to be shared on Instagram.That aside, and if you can get over eating in the dark...It's a mediterranean concept, with an affordable set menu, but the added bonus is the tapas of the day that comes round to graze on in between courses - which is devine. Some funky gin cocktails and strangely delightful Lebanese red wine, finished off what could have been a 5 star dining experience
4
A quick early dinner that has good reviews. The staff are quick courteous and professional which is a big plus. Decor and sound level excellent.The menu is very brief, very. More like mini tapas. We ordered one mezze one salad and two kebabs. Everything was good and in fact the kebabs were excellent our only gripe was that certainly the mezze and salad were definitely on the skimpy side. Nice flavour but value for money doubtful. The wine list is interesting but at the high end of the range 17 18 19 20 for a glass - a bridge too far.Good but order with thought
5
A friend and I met at the Fat Prince for dinner last night and had an excellent experience. From the start the service was great, all the servers were helpful and friendly, and very attentive. The first gentleman who helped me was very knowledgeable about the menu and able to recommend how many dishes to order for two people. He was also very quick to accommodate my special request of no avocado on my kasar cheese kebab (I have an allergy) and checked back later to ensure I'd received the correct order. Our waters were also very quickly filled when they began to empty. And the food was exceptional. We enjoyed the truffled bans ghanouj, which had a strong flavour of truffle that went well with the smoky eggplant. The turkish kisir salad was very tasty, but the true highlight of the starters was the okra falafel, complimented beautifully with bacon, cheese and a kale salad. The kebabs were the highlight of the meal however, the three I tried (smoked kasar cheese, honey chicken and the duck and pistachio kofte) were delicious! The bread they were served on was soft and fluffily, the meat tender and cooked perfectly, and all the flavours of the toppings and sauces mixed perfectly. They only have one dessert on the menu, the halva pudding with pistachio crumble and orange, and it was absolutely divine! Not too sweet or heavy, it almost had a savoury side to it, and the pudding itself was like a mousse, soft and luscious. And when we got the bill at the end of the night we were very surprised by the reasonable price we ended up paying for such high quality food. Definite value for money. My only complaint would be the music got a bit loud as the night progressed, but overall we had a fantastic experience and I'm already planning another visit soon to try their brunch menu
3
Both hip and hipster, the food on offer at the Fat Prince is fun and inventive. An overall enjoyable evening, marred only by the stubborn restaurant manager. My friend ordered a cocktail that he found to be not to his liking. I offered to take it off his hands, but I noticed the cocktail itself had been poorly made. Way too much Campari which overwhelmed the other ingredients. I brought this to the manager's attention, and his response was, "Well, what do you want me to do about it? If I take it back, we're just going to chuck it out. We can't reuse it." So it stayed on our table for the rest of the night. When the bill came, the drink was still on there. So I brought it up with the manager yet again. His response: "By rights, I can't remove it from your bill since we served it to you." I said, "I've told you twice now it was poorly made and not drinkable. I am not paying for it." After a few uncomfortable beats, he finally deigned to do the right thing and remove it from the tab. Really not the thing you expect from a manager in the service and hospitality industry.
3
Coming for Middle East with high standards in food quality and value for money, I see the experience in 'fat prince' a mixed one.On the positive side, the food was tasty, service is good.On the other side, value for money is much below average, place is small and easily get noisy, portions are extremely disconnected from the price
5
Had dinner with my wife and befriended couples. Heard about this new place from the same people as Neon Pigeon...they welcomed us very warmly and with a big smile,we had a big table for 8. As 4 of our friends were late due to flight delays (no thank you BA),we asked whether there is space for us to go and use the Ottoman Room,a more secluded and private dining area with a different menu. To be honest,the normal dining area was a bit noisy as the restaurant was packed,as all newbies on SG restaurant scene are...We were lucky as there was a table available and we headed to our table in the back. We immediately liked the setup and the much more intimate setup with romantic candles that you can manually adjust. If you dine at Ottoman room,you have to take the mandatory set dinner menu which means all-you-can-eat mezze,2 choices from the meat/fish section and 2 choices from the 'earth' side dishes. We chose short ribs and fish,together with the black lentil salad and mushrooms&faro...but first the mezze; we had 3 kinds of hummus,salmon and olives...and just because I love taboulleh,I had to order it extra. Later,oysters and a tasty tomato broth with something (lentil soup?) was also part of the mezze platter. All in all very yummy,my personal highlight was the taboulleh but all dishes were refined and yummy. Mains were also tasty,portions could have been a bit bigger but considering the different kinds of mezzes,there was plenty of food. We finished with Turkish delight (3 kinds,pistachio,pomegranate and chocolate) and a very nice pudding. Coupled with Lebanese beer and some Lebanese wine,it was a wonderful dinner. Wine was a bit punchy,but it's always the same in Singapore. Canadian general manager (sorry forgot to ask for name) came by a few times to check on us and always had a smile and a recommendation for us...all the other staff were attentive and precise too. All in all,highly recommend and will definitely return,a great new add on to the always changing Singapore restaurant scene. Fat prince and Ottoman room is a keepe

Reserve your seat to avoid disappointment on a weekend night. Nice interior and decor with good food and service!
4
1st time to Fat prince, food was amazing. Portions are small however and more appetizer options would be great.
5
We went with a group for dining at the Ottaman room and it surely was no disappointment. The food and drinks kept on coming and the different blends of taste were just great.
It would be a great place for couples dining as well.
5
Restaurant atmosphere was great, interesting drink menu and excellent brunch menu. But there was bit of hickup on bringing food for all guests at right timing.
3
The food was great! However, their service staff needs some improvement - first of all they are not very attentive to the guests. They always seem to be looking somewhere else other than their guests who have been trying to call their attention. Second, they don't really know anything about their wine list - clearly, they have not been briefed about the kinds of wine that they have. Third, they mixed up our orders and were unsure of what kind of kebab they're putting on our table. IT WAS ONLY THE QUALITY OF THEIR FOOD that saved them, otherwise we won't even consider going back

came for lunch. 2 of us shared the set meal. the portions are small - just nice for us to share. the kebas are flavourful. the lamb and prawns are really good - must try. the quinoa tabbouleh salad is very delightful. the halva pudding is a must to complete the meal. the restaurant itself isn't that big and the tables are a bit near to each other. when it got filled, it became noisy. on the whole, the food and service was pretty good

I was after a place to have a coffee whilst I waited for a friend. This was next to the car park. Nicely decorated and staff friendly the Quinoa salad was just a taste explosion, great snack or side order. But at S$20! Menu choice is small and you have to look twice to see the sweet list. It must be the thickest paper napkin I've seen!Wifi good and password protected. Bonus.Well that's a kicker. Just orders the sweet at 14:55 and the kitchen is closed. As I was only really after a coffee I would have been happy with that but to offer food and then close the kitchen before I've finished, there were other people still eating too, looses them a mark. There is only one sweet on the menu!

The atmosphere of this restaurant is really nice, and the food is really good. If I were to be critical, a couple of dishes are quite salty (which is probably authentic!) and the dish I had was smaller than the others (some turkish bread with caramelized onions and cheese... I forget the name). Very tasty thoug

The good news: pleasant, friendly, helpful, competent waiting on staff; a good ambience; really good food.The not so good news: (from an older generation's point of view) lighting too dim - I like to see what I'm eating; very noisy (conversation was almost impossible without shouting) although this was due to a long table of people who had had far too much to drink, therefore not the establishment's fault

Went here with friends during the week. Busy but the staff were very attentive. Food was tasty and different not your typical finger foods that you seem to find everywhere nowadays. Must try the Duck fat houmus, smoked cheese kebab and the lamb. All excellent. Cant wait for main restaurant to open in November

Nicely done up place with good selection of middle eastern foods. Kebab is in single-serving sizes, good portions to allow for sampling of a greater assortment of food.

Brilliant for date night or business lunch/dinner. Simple but awesome menu filled with many of your Favourite Dishes.
We will be back again that for sure.

Just like the restaurant's name, my experience there was fun and refreshing. Want to try out the whole menu!

We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food here - simple yet delicious and great for sharing. We ordered a few dishes and they were on the small side, but they were very flavorful. Went there on a weeknight and it was still quite packed but the waiters were attentive and courteous. Would definitely come back to sample other dishes and cocktails

Nice space & decoration. Cozy with vibrant details.The food experience is amazing. It totally change the way I think about Turkish food, after experience the real deal here. There are a lot of thinking in every dishes we have, including design & decoration. You will feel in immediately through every bite you have.Food trolley is fun and make your night special for a date night. Love the ambience here!! In every inches of my sight, I saw happy hip people. It is not just about food that gather these ppl in, it is a combination between happy elements and deeply well-thought food. Highly recommend for both date night and party. Thumb up!!

Food is very fresh and tasty but portions are very small for the price and not much choice. One bowl + one kebab (which is one of the main dish) cost $20+ and it is more like the size of an appetizer as you definitely need to take something else

Party of 7, saw the 5 stars rating on TA with an amazing decor on website -impressive set-up. It is either a hit-or-a-miss with the food variety, we tried everything on the dinner menu and find that there isn't any 1-2 really outstanding nor flavourful item on the menu; and too much flour from the kebabs. I recommend introducing more variety from the brunch menu to the dinner menu. The hummus dip and califlower are probably the best tasting items; cocktails are just so-so and could not offered anything out of the 6-8 cocktails offered on menu. The staff are not trained enough to leave a lasting impression with us; just take orders and be gone. Bronwen the manager came by to check on us a few times and we appreciate the friendliness, it definitely have potential to be amazing as they refine the menu and sharpen the bartender skills. The decor is very instagram-worthy so that is a big plus!

The brunch menu was perfect! Not too OTT so it was easy to make choices. I had the Smoked Salmon & Caviar and it tasted great with the potato pancakes that came with it. I couldn't get enough of the Clotted Cream & Honey! The honeycomb was a nice special touch to it. If you like churros, you should try the Turkish Fried Dough that comes in 3 different kind of dips! Score

We went there for dinner and had a very pleasant dining experience. We were a little put off by the fact that we were 'warned' that we had only an hour and a half to finish due the next booking but we finished well in time and the service was very attentive and friendly.We liked the hummus without the duck fat with the pita chips and the okra falafel a lot. We tried all the kebabs and found the lamb kebabs to be outstanding. We found the chicken kebabs to be too sweet (even considering the fact that it was called Honey Chicken). The Turkish tea was also disappointing

Dinner was wonderful, i highly recommend the prawn and duck kebabs. Love the salad options too. Great service; the staff was attentive and knew the menu well

Excellent Turkish Mediterranean fusion food..a must visit..nice take on kebabs and cocktails..good vibes

These guys are great, the kebab type tacos are full of flavour and I highly recommend the Kisir Salad and the truffle eggplant dip! Went there after work or with a bunch of friends for dinner... will definitely go back and try their Ottoman room at the back... beautiful decor too..

It is a such great place that you get to experience great food, nice people, cool space all at once... and must say a great ceiling height...hehehe! Chef tried to maintain authentic taste within his tweaks to the dishes, I must say that it worked. Please do not forget to try the Prawn Kebabs, Tabbouleh and Hummus with duck fat, those were amazingly good. Managers and staff were so nice to us and accommodating. Not sure it wasn't a busy day for them, sometime I felt I have a personal butler.I felt the space is so cozy, especially for a date. Music wasn't too loud. Cool material and design with nice shop front

We decided to try this place for Sunday brunch, feeling in the mood for some Middle Eastern cuisine and having previously been to Neon Pigeon and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The restaurant is lavishly decorated and staff are plentiful and attentive, but the food was a little disappointing - hummus was fine, but only fine, and avocado on toast was exactly that, avocado on toast with not much further embellishment. I had smoked salmon and caviar with scrambled eggs and peashoots, but again there was nothing particularly standout about this dish, and there was actually far too much smoked salmon! My partner had the beef Adana wrap which was more impressive.I had a long black coffee which tasted like decaf, the bill for two without drinks came to SGD80, not great value I'm afraid

My table is released even I called to give notice my late arrival. Limited portion and limited choice. Surprised by other reviews of rather high rating

Been here with group of friends for Brunch and Dinner and loving both of the menus!We basically ordered almost everything, but our favourites were Mushroom Menemen and Clotted cream for Brunch. Dinner menu focused on different kinds of mini kebabs which all flavourful, I vote for Adalar Prawn and Duck Kofte, accompanied with their homemade soda Turkish Tea and Ginger!Ambience of the restaurant and service were great too, Will come back for sure

Been for both brunch and dinner. The menu for both are unique and interesting, everything we ordered were flavourful and beautifully presented. By day the restaurant is bright and welcoming with their floor-to-ceiling glass windows and by night it turns into a sexy, moody, candlelit restaurant and bar. Love it! Definitely the best Middle eastern restaurant in Singapore!
