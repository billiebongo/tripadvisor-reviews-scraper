Nice, but really just a cafe attached to the Changi Museum. Good location though, and relaxing, particularly after the intensity of the museum.
4
Great choice of reasonably priced tasty food. Great quick service. Good prices and a fantastic menu. Highly recommended
4
We order a bark pizza and iced coffee it was great and relaxing experience. The crew are friendly and accomodating. :)
Keep it up!
5
Our group of 5 had a pleasant meal with no complaints apart from the food not all coming at the same time. Mine was first and was cold by the time the other meals arrived. Better coordination in the kitchen is needed
4
A relaxing alfresco space to eat, drink and chill. Pricing here are well reasonable although not the most economical. Worth a visit.
4
The food and service is not too bad, friendly servers. The lighting was a little dim and it may get a little stuffy as it's an alfresco cafe. If there's more lighting it would be good.
4
This cafe offers a wide variety of local and western food. Spend a quiet afternoon enjoying the huge portion of tasty food serve and the cool breeze surrounded by birds chirping was a wonderful experience. Free parking lots and spend another hour or so visiting the changi Prison chapel just next door after a heavy meal.
4
This cafe is in the area that I was working. Very popular at lunchtimes but the service was excellent, food delivered very quickly and such great quality and taste. Close to Changi museum too so great for a refreshing coffee, if working in the area this is a great place for a quick, delicious pit stop, would recommend

We had lunch here when we visited the museum. The staff were lovely and the food was great. One of the best burgers we have had. It is pricey as people say, but there is nothing else around and it is in a lovely environment.My only complaint was that as soon as you had the last mouthful or sip, the staff would race over and whip your glass or plate out from you while others were still eating and they would reach across in front of people who were taking a bite of their food or sip of their drink! This is really bad etiquette and they should wait until everybody has finished eating before removing the plates. I mentioned it to our waiter and he said that the manager tells them to do this!!!! Please let people eat in peace without constant interruptions to their eating and conversation as it is very off putting

Came here for a late night supper. Parking is quite limited here, so cross your fingers. Service was good, waiters greeted me as i walked in, food was served quickly and they were very attentive.Food wise, its quite good. Had the smoky duck which tasted great ($18). Portions for the dessert were big though, we couldn't finish our desserts ( fruit waffle ~ $18, Pancake ~$15). Note that their online menu is outdated though, so you'll have to go there to see their latest menu.The best thing about Barks Cafe would definitely be the ambience. There was nice music, nice decor and the cool breeze made it a very nice setting for a chill dinner/drinks. Note that there is no air conditioning though, so would advise you to come at night rather than in the day otherwise it'll be really ho
3
Food choice was aplenty but a bit pricey as the place is not air conditioned. Nonethess, its a nice place to chilax.
4
Really good food and service. Waiters are attentive and always responsive. Ambience is good and no mosquito bite even though its alfresco. Highly recommended! üëçüòÜ
4
The food is great! Best is the crayfish hor fun and the smoke duck! Very special from other cafe. They serve cakes and we got a slice for our birthday boy with candles! The carpark is quite limited. Got smoking tables!
3
This cafe is located next to the Changi Museum. Good place to stop for a drink or a snack but the choice of food is limited. Also they don't serve food until 11:30am. The prices are also a bit expensive.
3
Lovely ambience. Breezy although there is no air conditioning.Service was fantastic. Warm and friendly service staff.Chicken wings were good, most of the other dishes were above average. Good selection of western and Asian cuisine as well as alcohol and spirits.However, the food was really pricey. This is a deterrent otherwise I will come here more often certainly. Lower it by 25-30% and definitely more return guests.
3
Right next door to the Changi chapel and museum. The service was good ,drinks could have been colder the orange juice is not fresh which was disappointing the beer was ok but like the rest of Singapore over priced. We had the battered fish and chips batter was far to thick ,fish was nice ,salad was ordinary. No air con . There was a sit down area where you could have a cigarette and a drink which was a surpris
4
Stopped by for a very late lunch - well, it was almost dinner.Nice relaxing place with a selection of European and Asian food. Had a very nice chicken quesadillas - so tasty. Waffles for dessert are stupendous. All out door seating but good fans and a breeze blowing through. No hurry. Beer quite cheap at $25 per jug. Waitresses all Filipina and super pretty! So nice to relax here - I could stay all day
4
Was here for a business lunch and have to say very happy, staff were excellent and the prices were quite reasonable ( I had the. Lamb chops, which for SGD 30 were good value although a little too well cooked for my liking) other members of my party had variously the pizza which had what I suspect was tomato ketchup for the base rather than Passata but it was tasty, A seafood noodle dish and steak, all very well presented.There is a wide range of alcoholic and no alcoholic options on the drinks menu and the seating which is outdoors under an open sided building is quite comfortable with plenty of overhead fansDefinately recommende
4
FoodOrdered fish and chips and a burger... all i can say is the food is awesome and yummy! From the first time i dine in maybe 3 years ago till today, they have maintain the great food they serveAmbianceLocation wise - must have a car if you are not staying nearby. Ambiance is good. Very relaxingServiceAverage. Meets expectations.PriceA little expensiveOverall, i will still continue to visit this place so long they maintain the food and service standards
4
I come here quite often as it's just few minutes drive from my place. Love the ambience especially at night. At some nights they have live music, so do ask them about it! I usually go for the irrestibale tahu goreng. Though it's slightly pricy, but it's quite yummy! Love the duck too, you should try! Even though it must have been frozen duck sliced, but it's prepared delicately! Food: 8/10 (quite decent food. You'll love it)Ambience: 9/10 (Main selling point! Tucked away from busy Street, and live music at night)Value: 6/10 (quite pricey though. For the ambience. And in private housing area)Service: 7/10 (nothing to complain. Nothing to be too happy about too. Casual service. Pleasant, casual yet professional
5
We had a lovely meal and jug of refreshing juice here after seeing the Changi Museum. The staff were so polite and kind. It is well worth a visit.
4
We were there in the evening and the ambiance was cosy. Place was crowded and we managed to get a place. Food was reasonable decent and it was a wonderful dinning experience.
5
This restaurant is next to the Changi Memorial chapel and Museum. The food was beautifully fresh amd well presented. Great selection of dishes available. Service was excellent and the "outdoor" setting very relaxed and comfortable.
5
Was in the east and searched what's nearby. This restaurant came listed so we tried. Food and drinks were nice and service was good. Will be back again!
5
This is my first time dinning at this restaurant. I love the setting and the lovely ambiance was great. The foods is reasonable fantastic and everything is perfect! The service staff are very polite and friendly. Will definitely recommend this cafe to all and it is worth the visit which is next to the Changi Museum and Chapel. Advance reservation by phone and online booking is advisable before heading to there for dinner as it might get pretty full on weekdays or weekends
5
We were here two times last month and we have no complaints about anything! The food was delicious, the staff very accommodating and the place is simply fabulous. There is also a pool table and a couple of dart machines, with smoking section set away from the main part of the restaurant. Make a reservation if you are heading there for dinner cos the place gets pretty full even on weeknights
3
Nice and interesting place. Menu also interesting. However, if cheesecake is tout thing and you look on the website and find A menu for Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes, don't be fooled. Not available. Actually, no kind of cheesecake except one colourful (and not so appealing) item is available
4
Just visited The Bark Cafe on Monday, Dec 26th and it was a really good dinner. Meals were all delicious and well prepared. We had the Caesar Salad, Pork Ribs, German Sausages, Beef and Belgian Waffles after which were all really yummy. Not so nice was the Quesadilla which was a little tasteless. Word of warning though: portions can be rather huge at this place so do think about sharing which is what our table of 8 ended up doing. All in all a great dining experience in a casual yet romantic setting away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
4
My sister and I went there for drinks when I was in Singapore in late June this year. Loved that it was close to home and really liked their set up. It was breezy, lots of trees around and the staff were friendly. They have great food as well, as I came back with my parents, the second time around
4
If you want a nice and quiet ambience to chill out and have a drink or two at night, this is one of the place you might want to consider. Situated in the far eastern part of Singapore, the bark cafe offers you some great selection of drinks and food for dinner and supper. I will definitely order their signature chicken wings on my visit every time.
4
After a visit to Changi Museum (a must) this cafe is right next door. Plenty of eats and drinks in quiet surroundings.
Off the beaten track (like the Museum) so get a taxi.
4
Nice place with non aircon dining. Food are served on a slightly big portion. Good for small group gathering (group of 4) for sharing of food. We over ordered today.
5
Really nice cafe which is situated next to the Changi museum. Lovely cafe and an extremely nice caramel latte.
4
Located outside Changi prison Chapel, nice for dinner / evenings when its cooler as it is an outdoor place. Western and limited Asian menu, draft beer, mains about 15 to 30 SGD. If sensitive, mosquito repellent may be helpful.
4
Food was good, love the chicken wings. Nice ambience, it was pretty windy that night. Only downside was there's mozzies. Overall, good experience.
4
Nestled among greenery in the heart of Changi, this is one of my go to places to chill out and have decent eats and drinks. Our fave dishes include the smoked pepper duck, carbonara tagliatelle, chicken wings and tauhu goreng. I could sit here for hours, love the ambience!
4
An open concept cafe without aircon. Serve with western and some local dishes. Nice and quiet ambient. Food range with large varieties, there's soft drinks, beer and wines. It's quite accessible with either bus no. 2 & 29, just after Changi Prison. Great foods, great place & good service by their team
4
Location is a little off the beaten track, but it is worth the trip here as it is not very crowded on most days. They screen soccer matches as well, and the food standard her is above average. If you are around the Changi area I will recommend this place
4
My wife n I had an opportunity to have dinner with my son n friend. We had quite a good time there and had a few games of electronic dart which was new to me. A nice place for a hangout but was too warm and humid on that night. No air-con facility. But worth the long drive there.
5
The bark cafe is next to the changi museum. You can get a lovely meal here every one we saw looked a very large portion .we had coffee and tea and a piece of cheese cake delicious was nice to chill after walking round museum and reflect on what you had just seen and read
3
Large area in a leafy suburb next door to Changi museum. Food was good, friendly service and reasonable pricing for Singapore.
3
Good open air restaurant and pub. For someone looking for late night food and drink. Open late till 1am. Nice batter large chicken wings. Had a pool table to relax.
4
1.Good for its surroundings
2.We went as a team and food was nice. We tried almost 8 or 9 items
3.If it rains or if its cold, jus head here :)
4
Nice place to meet up with family. Food is ok and parking is convenient. Also dog friendly. Nicer in the evenings as it can get hot during lunch time. Casual atmosphere.
4
We had a very moving self guided tour of the Changi Museum, and wanted a short break before the taxi ride back to the hotel, Service was great, and the drinks were fine.
Call in after your Changi visit.
4
This restaurant is out of city quiet but really nice and great to chill and you can play pool also food is nice staff is also friendly and helpful.highly recommended
4
Great venue for lunch, although I am positive that dinner would also be enjoyed here, I have just never visited at any other time than lunch time. Not an expansive menu, but what is there is well prepared.Staff are very friendly and service is efficient.The house wines are also very palatable, so you can enjoy a glass or two with your meal, without needing to buy a bottle.Unlike a lot of establishments in sub tropical Asia, the wine has been kept in a cooler and is not warm, because of the need to serve at "room temperature"
1
Decided to take dinner here this evening. Decided to walk as I need the exercise - and I was sure that would whet my appetite. It sure did.Imagine how brassed off I was to be told "private function closed tonight". How short sighted of proprietors who depend on the public for clientele, to close their facilities at whim if they think they can earn more. Attitude sucks
5
I spent over an hour relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere here after visiting the museum next door. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful (they even gave me the private wifi password so I could browse the web etc as I was on my own) and the coffee was good (and large). I didn't eat.I would defintiely recommend coming here after your visit to refresh before moving on to the next attraction
5
This was a great surprise to us. We hiked out to Changi on our last day to visit the Changi museum, to pay our respects to a grandfather that was a POW. We didn't expect a beautiful treat like the Bark Cafe. An unenclosed eatery, open to the beautiful day, with very Reasonable prices, gourmet/pub food (great mix of both) they have a great selection of cocktails and beer. (Tiger beer on tap)The Staff were absolutely lovely. A great way to relax after a humbling trip to the museum. And a great way to sit and think about our time in Singapore.Highly recommended
3
If you are ever in Changi, this is a nice place to try. Food is good, for starters try their chicken wings and Tempura Calamari and main course their Chilean Sea Bass (a little salty) and cray fish Hor fun. Decent prices.
5
Great place for an informal meal. Located a bit out of the city but it's nice to get out and away from all the high rise. Can't fault the service, food was really good, we had the special of the lamb shank and it was so good it just fell from the bone. Also took some chicken wings and the goulash. Great ambience and I was pleasantly surprised with the live music. All to often it's too loud and its becomes impossible to have a conversation. Here was an exception. Would defiantly visit again.
5
Service and food cooking technique swallows and spits out PS cafe I visited earlier in the week. Duck is pink and pasta al dente. Dishes are somewhat localised but cooked to perfection! The place is as bright as a fish market but after a few stiff drinks it's hardly noticeable. Would return for sure.
4
Right next to the Changi Prison museum, the caf√© offers a nice place to chill out in the evenings for food and drinks. The place is laid back and the service is good. It is child and dog friendly and offers a nice place for a gathering of friends. But, being semi rustic, there will be insects about and if you are concerned about that, a mosquito patch is a good idea. Food is ok for this kind of a caf√©
4
We have had dinner here three times in the past two weeks as my wife likes the food here. It also helps that parking is free and they even have a staff to direct you to any available lot.The staff, both locals (including Steven) and Filipinos, are very friendly and service is very good. Do try their signature chicken wings (minimum of three pieces), as well as their beef and crayfish horfun, which has juicy prawns and fresh squid slices. I also like their Indonesian fried rice. Drinks are slightly expensive, esepcially for soft drinks like IBC rootbeer
4
This has been a regular place for us to dine as it is near and convenient to where I lived. The environment is nice and cosy in the evening. Good place to chill out with friends for a drink. Weekend you may need to make reservations if it is a big group. Sometimes they have nice music. We have tried their western and Asian food on the menu. It's reasonably priced. It has free parking
3
Pricey for a non-air conditioned environment though the ambiance is nice at night. Food is comparable to many others in the city and elsewhere. The signature chicken wings are rather a common placed dish. Staff needs to be more attentive to guests, especially those seated further away. Some areas of the cafe are rather dim to actual view what are eating. It is a good place to chill out for beers and bits. That's about all. Parking may be a problem most times. Not my number one place to visit as a local who lives very close by. Stressing again that the food is so-so and there is better out there. Maybe I am too critical but I must see value for money and I don't really. I guess one woman's meat is another's poison
5
Certainly this is one of my favourite place to hang out with friends over drinks and food. Great environment, cosy and really feel relax. The warmth & friendliness of the staff were definitely a plus to make you wanting to go back for more! More fried chicken wings & finger food
5
What a wonderful place to come for lunch especially since we thought it the Changi Museum was like in the middle of the nowhere. There was a wide range of food and I felt it was very good value. The portions were big and we couldn't finish the food.The waiters were also very friendly. Starters garlic escargots were yummy. I had the crayfish horfun - not like those restaurants with one small little crayfish but it had two big portions of crayfish. AMAZING! Fish and chips also had very big portions. Unfortunately I didn't like the beef fillet because there wasn't enough gravy - but maybe it was also because I was very full.
5
We have been here quite a few times and always had a great time. The food and service is very good. The fish and chips and satay chicken are my favourites. Its a good place to hang out after going to the museum. Its set in a very island style surrounded by tropical gardens. Its super easy to get to as well. Catch the no. 2 bus and get off at the Changi Museum stop (one stop after the women's prison if you are heading towards Changi Beach)
4
Enjoyed another evening at Bark Cafe - food was good (as usual), the wings are to be recommended
Would suggest ordering starters first and main courses after the starters arrive if you don't want everything to come as and when it's cooked
4
Great service. Good selection of comfort foods. Only selection of ice-cream is vanilla but they have waffles and mango delight which is good.
5
Have a drink and meals there is you like. If not, have some finger food. Was there having beers over the MUST have fried chicken wings. Great place to hang out over the lazy weekends with friends.
4
We were happy to find this place attached to the Changi Chapel and Museum. Good food, cold beer and lovely service.
4
After spending some time at the Changi War Memorial, this is a nice little bar to sit and relax with a beer and enjoy the good selection of food that is available.
3
Came here for dinner. Ordered creamy garlic escargot, garlic beef loin fillet, famous chicken wings and fish & chips. Escargot was ok but sauce was abit blend. Order medium for beef but was undercook to medium rare and does not have the tatse of rosemary, sea salt and garlic as statedin menu, vegetables were not sauteed as well but were only boiled, mashed potato tasted like garlic. Ask the chef to cook the beef abit more but it came back well done. Fish & chips was ok but personally I think the salad that came with the fish doesn't match as the dressing tasted like japanese sesame sauceas I think fish & chips is supposed to be a western dish. Nothing special about the wings as it tasted like prawn paste chicken which you can get at most chinese "zhe char". Good ambience, service was good, price is ok.
4
This restaurant is located just outside the Changi Museum and within sight of the bus stop where the #2 bus back to the train station pulls up. It is open air with fans and just feels right for the setting. The mocktail list looked great- I had the "Greenery" and it was - very green I mean. It was minty, cold and refreshing. I also had chicken satay, which was most tasty and nearly as good as the satay from the Old Market street stalls the night before. The service was most attentive and I enjoyed this place
4
Being introduced by friends to have lunch at this location, menu covers a spoil of choices of various type of food. I have ordered "smoky pepper duck", rather unique taste, close to french style with a local touch, the mashed potato under the duck is really awesome, it went very well with the meat....Staffs were very friendly, always put on a wide smile. great service!!!Worth a visit
5
Surprisingly hard to find vegetarian food with all the hawkers and restaurants in Singapore. They did not have anything on their menu, but made us a nice veggie pizza for $16. Right next to the changi prison and museum. Relaxed daytime atmosphere. Told they are very crowded at night. All covered outdoor seating
5
This little gem is tucked away, and really only accessible by car (or taxi), and known mainly to the residents in Toh estate. The lucky ones who do find it will enjoy simple comfort food done well, a relaxed fuss-free atmosphere under those high ceilings and surrounded by nature. A great spot for hanging out with friends
4
Had lunch with my mate which was a bark pizza and a couple of Tiger beers! Menu was varied to suit most tastes and prices to match.
5
The food was good and reasonable priced. Staff were friendly and helpful. Liked being able to sit in the open air but being under cover while the tropical storm was happening.
4
Great little bar & restaurant next to the memorial & prison. Unfortunately the memorial had closed 5 pm close. The beers next door were cold & great.
5
This place has been here for the longest time, and has developed quite a bit. It's my go-to place for chicken wings and beer. Great place to chill out with a group of friends. Usually packed during weekend nights. Service is rather efficient. Although it is tucked in a quiet corner of Changi it is still relatively accessible via public transport (Bus 2 and 29) and there is ample parking space too. I've been here on some other weeknights and there's a live band too.My favorites are the Crayfish Hor Fun and the Smoked Duck. The chicken wings are great as well. Id choose this place over many others in this area
3
The menu is a wierd jumble of pub type food it did not enthuse me at all.The starters came after the mains (not so unusual in these parts) and none of the food was great. I had mee goreng quite poor. Someone else had a tex mex dish that looked no better. Nice location though
5
the Bark Cafe is situated next door to the Changi Chapel....a nice relaxing atmosphere after quite a somber tour of the Changi museum. My sister had the club sandwich which looked excellent and tasted even better, my other sister had the all in burger which again was excellent. I chose the fish and chips, not so good as the fish was mushy and not firm, however edible. The other dishes going past such as the crayfish and lamb cutlets looked mouthwatering! The staff were cheerful, very helpful and attentive, service was excellent. Toilets also kept clean and tidy
5
This is the best meal we have had so far in Singapore. Perfectly-cooked mango salmon and delicious crayfish hor fun washed down with a nice cold Erdinger. Very reasonable prices for the quality and presentation, and quick efficient service by the friendly and helpful staff. Pleasant outdoor setting. Earlier we had tried the cappuccino - again, the best we have found in Singapore
3
Located next to the Changi Chapel, this cafe has both smoking and non-smoking areas. It serves dishes ranging from crayfish horfun, nasi goreng and pasta to its signature beef stew with garlic bread. Prices are slightly on the steep side, but the food is tasty. The staff of Filipinas and Chinese nationals are also very friendly, and always ready with a smile.We were there at lunchtime on a weekday and there was a sizeable crowd, so I would imagine that it gets very crowded on weedends
4
This restaurant is located in Upper Changi Road North and is away from the bustling crowd. It has a very good mix of families, couples, young and old clientele. I would say the food and service is very good. It has a mix of local and western menu and you can also sit and have a drink there. I am not able to find fault with a restaurant who has Avicii in its playlist. Reservation is strongly recommended for weekends and public holidays.Parking is free but a nice tip for the parking attendant is voluntary
4
If you are visiting the Changi chapel and museum and looking for a bite to eat or refreshment then this place has a pretty good menu. We had a light late lunch of duck sliders which were nice and the chicken satay sticks which I thought were lovely - great satay sauce. Staff were also friendly and helpful in arranging a taxi for us after we had finished
4
This sits next to the WW2 chapel. A great place to chill out with love one or friends over some beer and food. Quiet, and away from those noisy and loud place. Good to spend some quality time.
4
As spent too long in museum(at Changi Chapel) I missed out on this, it's part of the Museum site, but I hear it is very good so wanted to pass on local knowledge I gleaned in Singapore.
4
This place is located out of town, very cozy and smoothing feel. Excellent for coffee and chat among friends, with the noise. Food is reasonably good and reasonably priced. Setting is very comfortable, but do remember to spray your mosquito repellant.
4
Bark Cafe is located near Changi Chapel with free parking space which is something hard to find in Singapore. A must try local cuisine "crayfish hor-fun" and "prawn paste chicken wings". I like their fruity salad which is very refreshing. I'll use to order Choya Mojita - taste good for cocktail drink. Overall it is a nice cooling place to chill out with friends or family but not too often as the food pricing is slightly on the high side. Drop by on weekdays - Monday - Thursdays "live" music entertainment so far the singers are good.Take a look at their website: www.thebarkcafe.co
5
If you can't find a seat at the Porta Porta Italian restaurant, walk further down towards the Changi Chapel Museum and this restaurant is tucked just next to the museum. First, start with the chicken wings (a must!) and it comes in 3 or 6 pieces. If you are visiting Singapore, why not try some of the local dishes. Crayfish Hor Fun, Sambal Nasi Goreng (be warned, it is spicy) or the Jumbo Prawn Noodle Soup (request for de-shell so that you don't end up messy). Their western menu are equally good - steam cod fish, seafood agile olio etc. prices a little high but is totally worth every cent. Not only do you enjoy the food, but also the quietness and peace in this extreme eastern part of Singapore (it is next to the museum, not too far the Singapore changi prison and ard the residential area).You can take bus no. 2 from tanah merah Mrt (the mrt station where you transit from changi airport), no 2 also depart from the Pasir Ris MRT (from the bus terminal as well - depending on the direction, you may alight opposite the road ie a stop after the Women's prison, or right outside the museum if you are coming from the other direction, ask the friendly bus driver "changi chapel museum")You may also visit the Changi Chapel Museum, for a start you may think the museum is quite small, but you will be in for a surprise! Do check the closing hours, and pop in before having a meal at the bark cafe
4
The Bark Cafe is attached to the Changi Chapel and Museum, so we dined there because of it's location. We had the sambas nasi goreng which was tasty and filling but, at about $14, easily three times what we would have paid at a hawker stand. It cam with a fried egg, some crispy fried chicken pieces and a serve of vegetable acar (pickles)
3
On the plus side, this caf√© is dog-friendly (though it might be wise to ring ahead because you'll need a table on the edge of the dining area) and entirely alfresco with a garden setting. Service is prompt and the mainly Filipino staff are friendly and all seemed to be having a good day. If you're visiting Changi Museum, and you should because it's incredibly powerful and touching, then it's on the same grounds and an ideal spot to fuel up.If you're not visiting the museum and you're headed here for a meal, then it makes up for so-so food with a very nice ambiance. The food isn't bad, but as a previous reviewer noted, it's very much cafeteria food at restaurant prices. Expect burgers, fish and chips and the like in the $17++ to $23++ range. There are no chefs mixing seasonal flavours here... it's caf√© plates built to a formula. Our mains were incredibly average, but I can recommend the ginger mussels starter, which had stunning flavours. There's 17% added to your bill at the end, so budget around $40ph plus drinks if you're here for a meal.The beer is cold, the fans throw a nice breeze and the garden lights up nicely at night. It's probably not the type of food you want on a romantic date, but if you wanted to gather with some friends and have a couple of drinks and some bar snacks you could do worse
4
Bark Cafe is comfortably tucked away in a quiet area in Changi. Surrounded by greenery, it gives a peaceful atmosphere to enjoy your dining experience. Besides the cafe dining area, they also have an open bar area if you fancy just drinks.Take note, though, that parking space is very limited. The crowd starts to build up around 7pm. Do make a reservation if you are going in a big group.Pictures are uploaded to http://effandbee.sg/bark-cafe-away-from-it-al

Taken here for lunch and was not disappointed by the food. I went for the three small duck burgers served with salad and a small corn on the cob. The duck was cooked to my liking and it all tasted fine. As my colleague only had salad his arrived quite quickly with mine following about 10 minutes later. This would be my only complaint but it is a great stop off before or after the museum.
2
Went to this restaurant for a snack before visiting the Changi Chapel Museum. We ordered fish and chips which was OK, chicken ceasar salad - the salad was OK, but the chicken was fried with a lot of FAT and SKIN, the pork satays - or should I say pork FAT sticks, they were absolutely terrible, 2/3 fat. We also had potatoes wedges which were OK. I would not recommend eating in this restaurant, but OK for a few beers. Our overall experience was not enjoyable
3
Went to have lunch with colleagues as office in Loyang area. Located near Changi Prison, food consider average. Not very convenient if no own transport. Staff with good service attitude
5
Historical site by the day - Changi Prison and museum for WWII POW inmates and cool and chic chill-out alfresco dining and drinking restaurant by night.
4
Nice and cosy place to hangout. Food is not bad but price have increased. Would be gd to have more promo
3
Depending on the day's weather the dining experience will vary. Was there on a hot. And humid afternoon then another cloudy one. Nice atmosphere and good for catching up with friends.
3
Came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was quiet except for the soft music playing over the sound system. Found the crayfish hor fun quite good and would order it again. The fried chicken wings were well fried - crispy on the outside and moist inside. Just wished that they had a better selection of chilli to go with the wings. Normal bottled chilli sauce didn't quite do it for me.Service was polite but not necessarily attentive. We had to be patient for the dishes to be served and water was not refilled. Though there are many electric fans around, it might get a bit uncomfortable on a hot day. Thankfully, rain brought us some respite from the heat. The prices of the dishes are not cheap for a joint like this.
4
Living not too far from this nice little cosy cafe, I frequent this place for some beer or a nice drink .. The food variety ( not the taste ) is not to my liking so i generally avoid it but by the look of it, the food looks good and the smiles on the faces of satisfied customers says it all .. I prefer alfresco seating and this is the place for it ..

If you get to the museum by bus or taxi there is nowhere else to eat. Given there is a captive audience of museum visitors the food, drink and service were all perfectly acceptable. The cafe is outdoors so the fans will be very welcome when the breeze drops. There is a mix of Asian and English style food so something for everyone

It's a cafe beside Changi Prison Museum. Very good chill-out alfresco. They serve beer and food. Good place and good atmosphere for a big group to chill-out and company team gathering. Try no to sit near to the entrance because the gigantic fan will blow your head off.The rib, chicken wings and fries taste good. The dessert a little bit disappointment. The service is good and efficient although the place is crowded. They even have carpark attendent to lead you to the parking lot

Time was, a few years ago, when this places was reasonably priced and served interesting food. Now, it is over priced, serves average food more suited to a cafeteria and definitely over rated, which is a pity. It might seem a good idea to pop in for a coffee after wandering around the adjoining Changi Chapel Museum, but don't bother. It's only five minutes to Changi Village with its plethora of great eating and refreshment places

I would not go out of my way to visit the Bark Cafe.But if you're in the area - the place is nice to eat, drink and listen to music (not live music though).Word of warning - the area has a lot of trees / plants, so there are plenty of mozzies around
