I had a great birthday celebration when I went to this place It is cool. Happening is the word i would describe for this restaurant. I love spagettie a lot. Yummy.

Came for the food and drinks. Food was amazing with a wide variety of pasta to choose from. Drinks are exceptionally cheap. So if you're looking for a place to chill but without a "bar" atmosphere, this is a amazing place. Cheers

The Aglio Olio outlet at AXA Tower in Shenton Way served good and delicious fish and chips, and pastas. Food delivery was fast and efficient. Although the outlet was not large, it made for a very comfortable place for a weekday lunch.

Spent over 30 mins trying to find the place with its ambiguous address and no way of contacting the restaurant for directions. Mediocre food not worth my time at all.

Went here for lunch had the Caesar salad. Just lettuce and finely crushed croutons, no flakes of parmesan or anchovies.
Bit disappointing.

Came here with some colleagues during lunch time, glad that there were still some seats. We tried the various aglio olio dishes and they were pretty decent. The set menu is an add on of $2.50 that adds an extra drink and soup of the day

Visited on a weekday for lunch, and I ordered their cream based pasta with ham. The food took some time to arrive, but overall the pasta tasted pretty good! It was also reasonably priced; you may get to enjoy certain promotions depending on the day you visit. I remembered visiting on a Monday and getting to enjoy free chicken wings as we had ordered 2 main courses

I had Aglio olio pasta with vegetables and it was very good. We all had different dishes, but two of the six dishes were a disappointment. This cafeteria is very small and very clean, the waiters very nice and helpful.Look for more reviews by MulleEllum

We r 2 veggies and went here with a non veg pal. the pastas both veg and non veg were good, service was good, waiters were polite and helpful, but the salad I had was really nothing to write home about. Just leaves and some cherry tomatoes, the wasabi flavoured dip was quite spicy for me to eat, so basically ended up eating just lettuce leaves, what a bummer. wish they would elevate their level of salad and add a nice dip to i

Lets check the definition of mild from any online dictionary-(of a taste, sensation, etc) not powerful or strong; bland: a mild curry. You will understand once you read my rating for the food. Food- I am giving them a rating of poor as my cream based bacon pasta had close to 30 pieces of cut chilli padi inside it even though its was ordered as mild. Close to THIRTY pieces. I wonder whats their definition of not mild.Service- Good even though it was full as the staff were lively and running around to their best of their ability. Bad was because the staff rejected to look at my cream pasta once. The second time I asked, a female staff examined it and claimed that it was mild. Thereafter, I had to count the number of chilli padi inside my pasta for them to exchange it. Three times in all and I had to walk to their counter to persuade them. Unfortunately, I had to rate them terrible in aspect as per my experiences there.Price- Reasonable prices for a dinner within the CBD.Location- Nearest train station - Tanjong Pagar and you walk less than 10 minutes

Served it's purpose as a lateish dinner spot. Decor is modern, cosy and meals are filling. Had the seafood tomato based spaghetti and for $15 was fantastic.

Just happened upon this little place at lunchtime.

And plenty of combinations available.
Would happily return for another meal.

We had dinner at this restaurant for couple of times. It was recommended by my colleague. We like to order the $39+ set menu which offers variety and enough portion for two. It includes 2 drinks, 2 soup of the day, fried chicken wings and 2 main courses (pasta or pizza).So far this is the top few nicest aglio olio pasta I had in Singapore at reasonable price. And what I like was: they are able to cater the ingredient and the level of spicyness you wants. But pls be reminded that their chili is super spicy. I am the one who can take mild spicy but the mild spicy here is too hot for me. I always ordered non-spicy one and it taste super good. Pizza is nice too, full of cheese n crusts are thin. One thing to mention is their service not very good. They have this reward card system, but the staff do not initiate to ask you present the reward card when making payment. We have to remind ourselves to show them each time when we make payment, otherwise they will just give you another new card. Also, they won't tell you what is the pasta of the day, you have to ask them. i like their hot honey lemon drink too. It will served in a tea pot and portion is good. Go and try it

Went in on a hot humid Saturday. Nice bright little restaurant, nicely cooled. Staff were very responsive. We had seafood pasta and tomato based pepperoni pasta. Both were very nice offerings, we opted for mild spice...a good choice. Food was plentiful. Drinks were iced lemon tea which was perfect for the meal. A good option

I have been to this place for a company function. The environment here is very nice but a bit small. Food choices are wide range. U get to enjoy western food like pasta. Spagatti. It is quite delicious n price is around 13plus. U can topup 2.50 for coffee n soup. Overall quite happy with the place n food

Aglioolio is found in an area that is full of very good to excellent restaurants and they certainly hold their own. The service is excellent with waiters looking after us and always aware of when we need them and when to be left alone. The Manager also took time to speak with us that allowed the opportunity to be honest with our experience, and it was all good.Italian is my favourite food and this certainly is up there with the very good in quality and taste. It isn't the best I have ever tasted but it was very enjoyable, plenty of it and the taste spot on. I myself had a seafood pasta with plenty of seafood to satisfy anyone's desires and taste buds. The range of Italian Food available is varied and plentiful with three levels of spice. Mid spice was just a little too hot but did not take away from the enjoyment of the food. My partners meal was Mild Spice and that is very tame so there is certainly a level of hotness suitable for everyone.Lastly the value for money is there. Singapore can be an expensive place to dine but this restaurant certainly doesn't break the bank

I ordered Hawaiian pizza. It was very bad. Non-taste cheese, very few ham and pineapple. The instant pizza which I bought in Fair price supermarket is even better.My husband ordered pasta, medium spicy and it came up supper spicy with super a lot of chilly

Located on a walking street of restaurants I gave it try because I wanted, well, pasta aglio olio. Seemed like a sure bet. Service was inattentive at best, I felt like I was in a cafeteria rather than restaurant and no one bothered to ask if I'd like another drink, a refill or to order anything else

Located near China Square with the nearest MRT station being the new downtown line Telok Ayer station, this Bristo serves mainly the CBD office crowd during lunch hours. 4 to 5 choices of pasta sauces and different level of spiciness to choose from. I can take chilli stuff quite well but I find the mild level pretty hot, so be mindful when you indicate the level of spiciness when you order. Prices are pretty reasonable, you should check out their menu on this websitehttp://aglioolio.com.sgChoose the jumbo mix platter if you have 4 pax to share some finger food before the main course. I had the Ham Teriyaki sauce spaghetti mild chilli! and I rate it 7/10
