Fried chicken bao was delish! will come back for more.
Sunday roast beef was good too, meat cooked perfectly and sides with a slight Asian twist.

The chicken bao and the burger were delicious. We also tried the squid which was nice but not amazing. Good drinks on offer and decent service. Cool place and recommend making a reservation.

Went for a friends birthday . Service is good. Set menu $80 a head but price starts to increase when you add on drinks. Pork belly, steak and fries were very good.

We visited on a Friday evening when the atmosphere on Keong Saik is typically vibrant. The bar was equally vibrant but we were quickly made welcome and found a great spot at the bar for drinks. The bartender was super efficient, despite the crowds, and the cocktails were perfect. Lively bar with great service and, from what I could make out, great food. Somewhere we will no doubt frequent on a regular basis and next time enjoy dinner and drinks.

By the time we arrived the Friday set were in full voice. Add to that the DJ pumping out the music and you could hardly hear yourself think, let alone speak. Not the place for a quiet romantic evening; for that, you would need to visit the fine dining sister restaurant Cure, just a few doors up.Nonetheless the party was in full swing and everyone was having a great time. We started with whiskey sours. They were really good and the glass contained probably the single largest ice cube I had ever seen! We shared starters of squid deep fried in curry flavoured batter, salmon nachos, chilli crab and buns and fried chicken with buns. One of our group had the steak tartare but he wasn’t sharing that with anyone!For main course I had short ribs. They were delicious, tender and full of flavour. Others had lamb and two devoured the burgers.The wine was pricey but that’s something I’ve now come to expect in Singapore.All in all we had a great evening and the atmosphere was electric

I have been meaning to try this restaurant for awhile now. Finally managed to try it for lunch - had the Sunday roast and the chicken bun - shared this with a friend and the two dishes were enough for the both of us. Food was delicious and service was great too. Would definitely come back again to try other dishes and drinks. A really cool place to hang out with friends. Cool vibe

took a trip there for my last friday date night of 2017.. quaint place in the midst of the 'happening' telok ayer area. Ordered to share the kimchi beef tartare, nice and well balance, though the beef could have been cut a bit smaller. For the main I ordered the cheese burger and fries; which came with more fries than the burger itself (I didn't end up eating more than 1/3 of the fries). The burger itself was decent, juicy with good balance of flavours. The other 1/2 ordered the cauliflower steak (which came with cauliflower mash). The sauce for the steak was a tad too salty and totally overpowered the charred taste of the cauliflower

Had the rib eye (45$) and the lamb (35$) it was excellent and good value for money.. Service was fantastic from the 3 waiters we had... really topnotch.. friendly, professional... there is a lot of thought put in the food with a lot of little details....

Had dinner last night at Butcher Boy and thoroughly enjoyed it!This is the sister restaurant to Cure, also owned and run by Chef Andy Walsh. Tapas style eating, small dishes of gorgeous yumminess keep on appearing! The service is excellent, Beverly in particular is a superstar. It’s proving to be pretty popular and was completely full last night tables are very close together, and I do mean very close, so not entirely sure it would be great for either a business meeting nor an intimate a deux.

We had our Christmas dinner there and the atmosphere and the service were good. The snacks were good but the main course ie the pork and the steak were a let down. The pork was too salty and the steak was too grainy. The pepper sauce was too salty for the beef but or the pork.

Hip fit out, food and service were both good but not amazing. Would go back to check out the Sunday Roast but for dinner and drinks, other more exciting options on Keong Saik.

Went with a friend and really loved Butcher Boy! Great cocktails, food, and superb service. Will be back!

The beef ribs were delicious and succulent. Salmon nachos were meaty and crispy. Loved the skinny fries. The sake options were varied. East west one was fresh and just perfect. Excellent customer service!

Had to go there twice as we really liked it. First visit was for burger and beer and we enjoyed it go the full. Finished it of with expresso and rhum. Second visit we asked them for recommendations to eat and we had one of the best tasting experiences for a long time! The restaurant is really classy when you step in but you are really friendly welcommed by the staff. GO THERE!!

Had a couple of guest from Australia in town and decided on a more casual business dinner venue. Could not have chosen a better venue for ambiance and service. Tried the rib eye and pork belly as well as a few other dishes which were superb. The wine was well paired with the food! Too bad did not have space for desert. Will be back for sure! Props to Andrew and his team

Great variety of fusion cocktails & food. We love the cocktails with sake. The house signature ribs was delicious but we prefer the rib eye which was more lean and went well with the interesting Yuzu Bearnaise sauce. The beetroot & burrata tasted good & the oysters were yummy with the very refreshing sauce.

3 couples of friends went to the Butcher Boy on Friday evening booking for 8.45pm.Table of previous customers were hushed out subtly to the bar to finish their drinks. Delicate exercise reasonably well performed. The menu is obviously focused on meat eaters but still managed to cater for a vegetarian/ fish eater. Overall the food was very enjoyable and of good quality.However we could barely hear each other as our conversation was drowned out by a super loud music (that I ended up measuring = average of 105 db). Not recommended for people seeking a place to catch up

We ordered their highly recommended dishes such as their ribeye and pork belly slices and he banh mi, and there was nothing fantastic about them at all.Their signature ribeye was burnt and bitter. The sauces offered sounds interesting on paper but ended up being a poor pairing to an otherwise dry and bitter steak. You can get better tasting pork belly and heaps more of it from any roasted goods store in those wet markets.The banh mi was perhaps the only saving grace, with a tinge of duck liver sauce packed in its tiny bread body. But to pay $20 for a mouthful of banh mi of that quality is a real pain.You’re better off spending your money elsewhere if you’re going for beef.Food aside, the place was way too cluttered and noisy for an enjoyable meal. My partner and I had to shout across the table to hear each other over our Saturday night dinner. You have been warned

As a meat lover, I couldn't do without trying this place. The meat was good - not great for that price though. The sake however was terribly overpriced. I would go back again but maybe for wine/beer pairing. Service is rather inconsistent - one very helpful young lady full of initiatives and one rather useless guy to balance it off. Answer to my question "What is the Cauliflower Steak?" was "It's a steak of cauliflowers". Maybe he thought that was a stupid question... The Cauliflower Steak was great by the way
