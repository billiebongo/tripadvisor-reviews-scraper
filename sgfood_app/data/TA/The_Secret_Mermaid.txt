There is something innately cool about a restaurant which becomes a bar at night. Drinks are very decent and reasonably priced. Old fashioned comes strongly recommended.

Kelly, the eye-catching bohemian-esque, yet shy head mixologist made a wonderful Last Word (a 1900's cocktail). Truly one of the best I've had! Her junior mixologist, Joe, made an interesting, refreshing celery-based cocktail worth trying, especially on a hot & humid day -- ok, that's every day in Singapore! I could ignore the fact that the Secret Mermaid had a exhaust ventilation problem (you may end up smelling like whatever's cooking), because the drinks were so good! Great post-work drink dive. This Secret Mermaid isn't going to be secret for too long
