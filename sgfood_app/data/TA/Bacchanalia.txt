Beautiful prepared and presented food. Tasted delicious. Ambience just as you would want it. Michelin star well deserved.

There are quite a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore. We visited the restaurant because of Citibank. We informed the restaurant that we will using a voucher and gave them the reference upon reservation. The restaurant charges reservation fee of ~$60 per person, unheard of from any other top restaurants. Upon entering the restaurant, there was no one to show me to my table. I have to look out for my spouse who was fortunately already seated. Next, when we inform the manager again that we will be utilizing our voucher, she started giving various excuses to dishonor the voucher even though I requested that she verify with the bank. The manager could simply settle the administrative issue with the bank and not put the customers in an awkward situation. A very bad start. Food was decent. But so is any other reputable restaurants. Personally, what set a restaurant apart is the dining experience. The restaurant charges for iced water, not bottled water, which was not communicated to the customer. Penny foolish. And we were wondering initially why there were only 2 couples and a table of three during lunch time in the busy business district! We will definitely not patronize, or recommend, the restaurant again. For more than $100 for a set lunch, one has no problem finding better food and better service in the tiny island of Singapore.

Loved every mouthful - each element a surprise and perfect. Such attention to detail was outstanding. Exciting to watch each dish prepared with care and checked by the chef. Very calm kitchen with expert staff. Not at all pretentious and the staff and chef took the time to chat to us about the dishes. Don't miss this - best meal you will have in Singapore and fantastic value

We had booked this restaurant a few weeks in advance as we had family visiting from overseas and wanted to take them somewhere really special for one of their birthdays. We were really looking forward to the evening and meal, especially having read such good reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately though, we left the restaurant feeling really disappointed. The table was laid out beautifully and all was well at first with the serving staff explaining the menu thoroughly. We all ordered the 6 course tasting menu and had noted earlier in the day that the restaurant offered 2 x free cocktails for ladies on Wednesdays, which we thought was a bonus. We asked our server about this but they said this does not apply and they quote 'knew nothing about this' (despite being on the website advertised for the entire month)- this seemed very strange and unprofessional as it was on their website as a promotion. We reluctantly got one drink provided but instead of offering to find out, the staff were quite dismissive when we questioned this- almost making us feel like we had done something wrong by questioning it. It would have been better if the staff had responded differently and they would check rather than a straight up no. We had asked for the second drink but it never came. In each of the 6 courses, the quality of food was fantastic and of really high standard. Unfortunately they got my partners order wrong, which meant he had to wait a while for his meal to arrive and at the end of the meal tried to charge us $25 extra for the beef dish (when he had ordered the lamb). It was likely genuine mistake but the waitress wasn't very apologetic about this. I'm not sure if we were just unlucky as our table was at the back of the restaurant but we did feel like we were being ignored by our waiting staff – for example, it took 10-15 mins to receive the card back once we had paid (in the end one of our guests had to get up and ask for it). It wasn’t the sort of service you expect at a Michelin star restaurant. Our particular waitress had a bit of an attitude and one of us had ordered about the cheese platter instead of a desert option, which we were advised by the waitress included several different cheeses, but it came with only one small bit of cheese. It is a real shame because as I mentioned the main food was so nice and the set menu at $120 ++ per head is a good value for money, but the place really needs to brush up on the service. The chef is very talented and had come to ask our table our feedback at the end of the evening, which was a nice touch and we happily shared. He did apologise but we were surprised that in most high end restaurants, they would do something to try and apologise/rectify for the experience and compensate but nothing was offered so again it was a shame as we just left feeling quite overlooked. We are not the sort of people to complain and the experience really let us down (and our guests birthday). In summary, very good food but due to the service we experienced, can’t say we would rush back. We are understanding that mistakes happen, but there were simply just too many during our visit, which became hard to ignore. We would hope the restaurant will review this so other customers aren’t disappointed or dissatisfied

We were in Singapore for a stopover on our way to the Philippines for our honeymoon and our friends had booked this restaurant on our behalf, so we had not done a lot of research and had no expectations. The experience from start to finish was a treat. Friendly and knowledgeable server staff who guided us through the menu and wine list. We knew things were going to be great from the seaweed butter to accompany the bread with a delicious glass of champagne. From there we were treated to foie gras ballotine, fresh scallops, a delicious oyster bavarois and our favourite a succulent, tender fillet of beef. We were lucky meet with Luke and some of his team who were all charming and knowledgeable. I can’t recommend Bacchanalia highly enough and will be returning for sure the next time I’m in Singapore.

We were celebrating a special occasion (birthday) here as a couple. I think in an attempt to give us a more private time, we were seated at a booth-like table at the back of the restaurant. It was, unfortunately, right across from a refrigerator/wine cabinet, but we understand that it was probably as private as it could get.The service was amazing, as expected, with the staff answering our questions patiently and giving a great recommendation for wines based on our personal preference (she prefers white, I prefer red, regardless of what food we're having). I had researched the menu online earlier on the day of the visit and was slightly surprised to see that the one presented to me was different, but that just shows the ability of the restaurant to vary their creations every so often. It would have been better if the menu on the website had been more current (I checked a few days later and it was updated). The presentation of the food was only outdone by its taste and texture. We went for the Seasonal Inspiration Menu (without wine pairing) and had the Foie Gras, Scallops, Cod, Beef, Tart, and Parfait, and everything was nothing less than perfect
5
fantastic as expected . service went down pat , chef luke armstrong was fantastic in his approach. They were shorthanded in service but rounded it off very well . genuine warmth ! food .. ahh just superb .. the highlight was the torchon of foie gras in sauternes and the hokkaido scallops !
5
I had the dinner here during my first time in Singapore and i really know what is Singapore!!! My friends guide me to the top restaurant and we had this place for the dinner, i've try the set menu with wine pairing and all course is really enjoy! I would recommend this restaurant to you who visit Singapore please try this restaurant. Best Chef Best service tea
5
6 course of flavour heaven!All 6 course were exciting and mouthwatering. The Hokkaido scallop appetiser was huge but full of flavour and perfectly cooked. The capsicum sauce complemented the scallop perfectly but was also full of flavour on its own. The lamb was delicate with beautiful texture and flavour. My wife had the beef which was excellent as well. Parfait for desert was a great finish. Every dish was beautifully presented and a feast for the eyes. Overall fantastic food and a great experience. Thanks to the staff at Bacchanalia for a very special anniversary dinner. Service was great and food was memorable. PS Hope the drinks menu is looking more complete for our next visi
5
Every dish is very thoughtfully planned and cooked, creates explosion of flavours in your mouth, leaves you wanting more and more. We tried the degustation Chef menu as I thought it's quite reasonably priced. Well, I ended up think it was underpriced considering the quality of food and service we got. I highly recommend this restaurant to all TripAdvisor readers
5
Fantastic food!! Came to this restaurant by chance and what a great surprise. All dishes tasted of superb and can warmly recommend anyone going to Singapore to stop by here.
5
Working lunch. Chose the artichokes risotto, line-caught bass and lemon pousset. The food was 10 out of 10 with excellent service. The staff were great, professional and friendly. Will visit again.

Each course is delicately prepared with passions. I love the dry-aged fillet of beef & hand-dived scallops. Unquestionably delicious. Very reasonable price.
3
Great service staff.
We were seated at a table in the inner room and it was really warm.
the food was average-good.
5
A divine experience. Each course was well thought out, exquisitely prepared and presented and full of flavour. Every morsel an amazing taste sensation. The head Chef Luke welcomed us and along with his staff served us explaining each course. A relaxing environment to dine in watching the chefs create their dishes in a calm peaceful manner. This was excellent value and a dining experience I shall never forget. Thankyou Luke Armstrong and your team for this heavenly experience

The layout of the place is a little ofputting with people preparing food all over the place. The girl who greeted us also seemed lost and out of place (all evening).The food and the attention to detail are outstanding. The discipline exercised in kitchen and on floor by the chef is a sight to behold.The food items are all lovingly crafted and cooked and prepared to perfection.The wine pairing was by and large good. The Chardonnay at the dessert stage seemed a little out of synch. and didnt really pair well with the very sweet pistachio parfait. A muscat or German dessert wine may have been a far better choice.Overall very good
5
We are a regular lunch customers to this cosy resturant, however, we stop visiting after their nuisance practice of excluding bread and coffee/tea in the set lunch package. Now everything is back to 'normal'- finally the bread and coffee/tea are included in the lunch package again. 2 course S$55++ and 3 course S$65++. They have relocated the open kitchen upfront, to showcase the craft and the dynamism of the kitchen teams. We can sense the high energy, youthfulness in plating, freshness of taste and overall comforting and relaxing ambinece. Definitely a welcome change. The price without wine per head is close to S$100 per head after all the supplementary charges, tax and service fees. Not cheap. But we shall return soon. Bravo
5
We went to the restaurant for a friend gathering and we left a happy bunch. We enjoyed the dishes with the taste, freshness, and presentation. This was the second visit of my wife and I; we had a lovely time each.The atmosphere was relaxing yet with the right vibe. Service was friendly and yet not overwhelming. The advice on food and wines were spot on and we felt we're being looked after
5
I am actually writing this review after 2 visits to the restaurant in quick succession. The first was when my Wife and I attended a special dinner with visiting 3 star Michelin Chef Curtis Duffy. We had a great meal with fantastic food from start to finish. I was so impressed I then took my team from work for lunch yesterday. There's a great lunchtime menu which is fantastic value at $65 for 3 courses. Far more reasonable than most Singapore competitors. Menu limited to 3 choices per course but every dish served is great. Would recommend The Kitchen at Bacchanalia to anyone looking for a memorable fine dining experience in Singapore. Dishes are innovative and well executed but most important factor by far is the great taste throughout.
5
I recently had a meal at Bacchanalia, after hearing very positive things about the new Chef. The food was a 10 out of 10! The service was wonderful. The foie gras torchon with truffles and grapes was a standout and really shows the chef's skill. They serve it with toasty buttery brioche that is housemade. It's not a cheap place but experiences like that are worth every penny. It's one of the best meals I've had all year. I loved it. A sincere thank you to the staff on a job well done
5
Working lunch.
The foie gras snow proved to be a nice contrast with the white peach. The chicken breast was tender and juicy. An overall excellent experience. Well done!
5
Great setting, very good food and definitely recommended. We will go back as soon as possible.
I'd recommend asking if you can choose a main from either menu and I like the idea that they have carafes as an option for wine.
5
Chef Luke is very talented. I really admire his transformation of the vegetable and fruits as well as his flavor associations.
5
Had an unplanned set-lunch here, just next door to FOC in Hong Kong Street, and it turned out to be a very positive surprise. You could choose between 2-course, 3-course or a 125++ tasting menu. We went for the 3-course with some good wine. Two free amuse bouches were fantastic, the starter was brilliant, the main course I chose (cod) was simply delicious and I just went for coffee as dessert while my friends went for the cheese platter which they liked also. All in all, very nice food, good location, not cheap though but not outrageously expensive either, friendly staff, maybe a bit too friendly with the water pooring (I had to say 4 times I didn't want any more water because different waiters kept appearing at our table - but that is a small detail and not so important), so conclusion is that this is a fine restaurant you can recommend to your friends.
3
We visited the restaurant on a weekday, for lunch. The quality of food and the service were quite good. There is however, room for improvement. Perhaps, as a Michelin one-starred restaurant, there were some raised expectations but comparatively, the overall experience was similar to other good quality restaurants - meaning it was not apparent what tipped the scale to score the star... Nevertheless, kudos to the service staff, they were trying their best, but at times, they seemed a bit unsure about how to explain the dish that was served
5
Was there for lunch on Saturday. We've been there on a handful of occasions in the last 12 months. Just want to say this latest meal has simply been outstanding. The thoughtful utilisation of fresh, complementary ingrtedients cooked to perfection, the artful, creative presentation--they combined to surprise and delight. Our favourites were the beef tartare with caviar, the Momotaro tomato on a bed of quinoa, the white asparagus soup, and the sea bass. The white chocolate petit fours literally pops and the flat white was a fitting way to cap off the meal. The service was attentive and unpretentious. Chef Luke Armstrong has gotten everything spot on. Kudos to the Bacchanalia team
3
My wife and I went there for a dinner. This was just after the change of chef (and also the change of menu). Food was good of course but when compared to other one star restaurant we have been to, in Singapore or outside Singapore, it was not as exciting. The decoration of the restaurant itself is ok but not particularly great. Overall, a good experience but we found it not up to the one star label (and the price coming with it)
5
We had a beautifully presented lunch at The Kitchen at Bachanalia one Saturday.What we loved was the open kitchen, where we could see the chefs prepare the final touches of each dish before they are served, and even had a brief glimpse of 'Hell's Kitchen' type drama. ;)On to the dishes!The amuse bouche were innovative especially the chef's take on Singapore chilli crab (a creamy curry concoction encased within a crispy pastry shell with a morsel of fresh crabmeat perched on top. This all sits on a crab shell that comes complete with eyes!), and the velvety, punchy white asparagus soup, rich but not cloying, milder, less vegetal and sweeter than the regular green variety. The beef tartare was also notable.Both mains of sea bream and beef short rib showcased superbly fresh ingredients and light, bright flavours. Fish was especially good with a crackling crisp skin and soft flaky flesh. We also enjoyed very much their use of various citrus flavours and zests to create an uplifting and refreshing flavour profile, especially in the strawberry breton dessert that we both had.Service staff Vino was friendly, attentive and personable too, opening up with titbits of information about the food we were presented with. Chef Armstrong was sweet - he saw that my wife was keenly watching the activities in the open kitchen and came over to show her a dish he was prepping for dinner service! He explained the dish, foie gras, and how he was going to serve it later. Starstruck! :DWe left feeling satisfied but not overly full. It was such a good experience that we immediately made another reservation for July! Highly recommended
5
The new head chef Luke did a really good job of presenting and executing all the dishes we ordered. Both my wife and I were very impressed by the beautiful plating and unique blend of taste and textures that his team delivered.Outstanding ones were the asparagus soup, main cod dish, tartare, and the pistachio dessert.My lamb loin was like a work of art, though the cod and its tomato consommé really stole the thunder for me.Who knew for dessert - pistachio ice cream with a coconut layer covered in some form of lime wrap was sooooo taste provoking!The only dishes I felt was slightly underwhelming were the French mushrooms (over salted) and the chill crab cracker (lacks a punch but tasted like good crackers). Overall though, the menu flowed well and I guess balanced the palate. Highly recommended for a date or for biz lunch to host

The hard part is the food and the service, and The Kitchen at Bacchanalia has that just about right. Undoubted skill and expertise is brought to bear to provide a well consider and harmonious menu, with variety and great flavours. The wine matching is also well considered and draws on clear knowledge and experience to provide a memorable experience. The staff appeared keen and knowledgeable, if a little eager to move from one course to the next. So why neglect the easy part? The setting and the ambience of the restaurant is poor - I would say 'cafateria-like'. Austere and uncomfortable making it difficult to relax and enjoy the culinary experience to the full.At this price bracket I expect a 'total experience', but received only a 'partial experience'
5
The Kitchen at Bacchanalia has always been a fantastic experience. My favourite dish is definitely the White Asparagus with the morel stuffed with Foie Gras - absolutely delicious. It is my go to place for a good fine dining meal.
5
An Awesome atmosphere, great food with excellent presentation and a wonderful team of service staff.
5
Had the opportunity to return and try latest menu, led by new chef Luke Armstrong, and definitely a yummy occasion. Great place for dates and small groups of friends, and throw in a wine bottle - perfect dining evening and a memorable time.
5
5 of us went for the dinner set menu which was varied, interesting and very fresh and tasty. Portions were a decent size and we were full at the end. The japanese tomato was incredible, as was the asparagus soup. I also loved the beef. The accompanying vegetables and sauces were also excellent. This is as good as Andre in my opinion. We will be bac
5
the presentation, variety and extra touches were excellent. Luke the chef came by the table and described a number of dishes. There is little to say as constructive criticism, we had the table in the front, if I had to reach for something it was some of the people describe the dishes were hard to understand and the table in the front window had people walking by and looking in as well as a lot of tour type buses in that area. These are just side points, the meal was excellent and we would return. They change the menu regularly so there is always something new
5
Absolute unique experience and the personal attention by chef Luke and his team, who were extremely focused on the small details. We choose "Flavours and Balance " menu, shizuoka fruit tomatoes, Turbot with oysters and verbena and scallops with yuzu and dekopon were our favourites. Deserts fabulous and again attention to details with everything on the menu was great. Definitely worth the visit, such a Wonderful experience of tastes, we will be back again soon
5
From the time we stepped into the restaurant, we were made so comfortable by the friendly staff and the pre appetisers that were send our way by Luke and his assistants. The presentation of the appetisers, mains and desserts are so exquisite and the flavours are indeed a gastronomical exhilaration to the palate.We can see the creativity and effort in the entire Flavours and Balance 8 course meal. Will definitely be back to try the other menus and to recommend to our friends.Thanks Luke for an amazing dining experience
5
We were actually having a bad day before we went to the restaurant. Usually, when you are in a bad mood, everything is just tasteless. Amazingly, the food here turned everything around, it's like a reminder of beautiful things in life.The amuse-bouches were just "WOW!", so delicate and beautifully presented. Every plate was like a work of art. Love the open kitchen, we got to see how our food was prepared with attention and appreciated the work behind every bite
5
This is the second time that i dined at The Kitchen at Bacchanalia. My first impression was good and I wanted to test it again. The kitchen did not fail and dishes were prepared with the same level of attentiveness. I like the fact that the chef features vegetables in his dishes, as with green beans, almonds & white peach. I like the fact that there are not too many extraneous touches on each plate, and that sauces are minimal but intense in flavor. I like that the menu is concise but interesting.I was particularly impressed by one of the young wait staff who genuinely took pride in the food.Overall a pleasant mea and We will be back
5
Dined at the Kitchen at Bacchanalia this week, this was my 3rd visit and I must say I was blown away by the food, service and atmosphere. All courses (we took the 7 course) were incredibly thought out, beautifully presented and great flavours and balance. Service is not stuffy like a lot of fine dining restaurants. I really liked the casual atmosphere which allows the food to really standout! Will be back for sure, can't wait to try new menu items :
5
Good Friday so chose Essentials menu with fish option and wine pairing. Very impressed. Amazing flavours and beautiful presentation. Team were friendly and articulate. Will look forward to coming back.
4
We've been to The Kitchen at Bacchanalia twice, and have been impressed each time by the friendly and approachable service staff, the lovely food that was prepare and presented with delicate detail, yet not over the top. Just love this place!
5
Food offerings were simply iconic, not a dish that i tried was unfavorable. Great restaurant for a great occasion!
5
Ambience: open kitchen concept with many staffmembers bustling about. Cool to see them each playing a part in the process.Service: Exceptional. All of the staff, from the host who greeted us to the busboy who refilled our water to the chef himself, were friendly, knowledgeable, and went out of their way to ensure we had a good time.Food: Delicious. My wife and I ate at Bacchanalia under the previous head chef, this food was definitely more to our liking. The flavors were strong and interesting without being overpowering, and the main dish - pigeon - was tender and flavorful.Certainly not a cheap meal, but the tasting menu was a treat for the taste buds. The friendly service was the cherry on top
5
Faultless dining experience. We had the 8 course menu with wine pairings everything was exquisite both in terms of flavour and balance between culinary influences. The open configuration added to the atmosphere and overall experience, helped in part by the incredible level of coordination between the team. Luke has created a fine dining experience in an environment that makes you feel extremely comfortable, with none of the pretensions of comparable eating experiences, and nothing to detract from the food and inspired wine pairings
3
Ambience: open concept kitchen, so get to see the kitchen team cooking Food: Above-average, I expected more because it is a Michelin Star restaurantService: They cleared the side plate (for bread) even we have not started our first course, they probably can leave it and clear it after main course (most of the time people like to eat the bread with the balance sauce on the plate)!? They need to be more attentive and speak clearlyPrice: Reasonabl

Thankfully, I managed to secure a spot for lunch using Chope. It was fully booked for lunch that day! There are no Ã  la carted available.Luke Armstrong managed to work the ingredients to highlight their freshness and showcasing them simply but artfully.We added the cheese platter to the meal: however, there was neither a "theme" to it nor placed in an order that'd be pleasing to the palate..Roquefort in the middle?! If one was a cheese-novice, the blue would have killed the taste of the others.Otherwise, we were seated near the front of the restaurant, I suspect less din even though we are smack surrounded by the prep kitchen
5
We just returned from an amazing dinner at Bacchanalia in Singapore and it was so good I wanted to write this down before I forget. We had the essential with wine pairing and it was incredible. Great wines, fun starters but most importantly our mains were standouts - I had the lamb and my partner had grouper and both were above and beyond ordinary. We truly enjoyed the fun wine pairings and the desserts as well. Would recommend to anyone looking for a fun culinary date night in Singapore- the food does not disappoint :
4
I love Bacchanalia, it has always presented a great meal- before with Chef Ivan and now Chef Luke. A few weeks ago I took some work people from overseas for a meal here. We were having a wonderful time when debt collectors turned up. I could overhear them talking. It was crazy!!! A classy and wonderful Michelin starred restaurant and debt collectors during service!!
5
This is a wonderful little gem, offering a friendly yet modern environment to savor top notch cuisine. Since the kitchen is an integral part of the Restaurant, the cooking becomes part of the experience. All that featuring a calm and genuinely caring chef... Great food and great experience. Definitely recommended and price/performance is excellent
5
The food was incredible! The Scallop dish was so good and the wait staff is amazing. We loved the atmosphere and it definitely deserves its Michelin Star, if not 2! We will be back if when we visit Singapore again.
5
Awesome atmosphere, incredible food and waitstaff that are out of this world friendly and helpful. Certainly get what you pay for - would recommend to anyone looking for an innovative dinning experience.
5
Loved the innovative way Luke manages the ingredients. The scallop ceviche we had was amazing, and the grass fed beef tenderloin is one of the better meat main dishes in a long time. It had every thing. The asparagus was not my favorite and missed a little bit of the innovative thinking that the other servings had. It is an open small kitchen and is very enjoyable to see the staff preparing the plates. Very relaxed atmosphere, and even when there were a little bit more stress in the kitchen the team worked together without letting the sound volume to increase, which is quite important if the kitchen is placed in the middle of the restauran
4
We came back here a hand full of times for lunch and had been a satisfied regular customer. The food presentation and taste is world class. The 3-course set lunch is $55++. However it does not include bread and coffee. We have a glass of Grenache Gris each and round up with our usual coffee. The bill come up to about $100 per head. But the entire experience is elegant and cheerful. Good place for business lunch
5
I have been to Bacchanalia when it was at Coleman Street, and again at Hongkong Street last year, and absolutely loved it, so when I heard they had a new Head Chef (Luke Armstrong), I booked the place for our anniversary dinner. And I was not disappointed!First the service: From Asha, who ushered us in, to all the staff members who brought the food and wine and patiently explained the dishes, everyone was uniformly attentive yet unobtrusive as they let us have our dinner at our own pace. The place was completely full, yet there were two or three staff members magically appearing whenever wine needed to be poured or a plate needed to be taken away, or a napkin was dropped or the glass of water was empty. Luke came around twice to make sure everything was ok over the evening, and overall, it was one of the most pleasant experiences from a service perspective.Next the food: we ordered the eight course dinner (without the wine pairing, we loved a wine from the wine list and had that). It was delightfully structured, from the hand dived scallop, to the grass fed tenderloin with aubergine compote. I personally thought that the beetroot with the cabernet sauvignon sauce was the most innovative, and my wife found the artichoke with foie gras 'snow' very interesting, but overall every dish left its distinct impression on us. The desserts were subtle and importantly not too filling.For the fine dining experience, in the context of Singapore, the pricing is most reasonable. Overall, a great experience, and we will be back soon. All that is left is to say 'Thank You' to the the Bacchanalia family members for making a memorable evening
5
We went to the Kitchen at Bacchanalia for lunch. The service was perfect and so was the food. We each ordered something different and the flavours and presentation were very unique and appealing. Our service was the best we have ever had and our water glasses didn't go below half. I'm not sure if I like the open kitchen, but everything was perfect from the appetizers to the dessert. We were greeted by the Chef and we would definitely go back
5
We first met Luke the head chef at Pollen Street Social where he prepared our desserts at the dessert bar. He informed us he was going to the kitchen at Bacchanalia in Singapore as head chef. After such an amazing meal in London we were really looking forward to what Luke could bring to a city like Singapore. We were pleased to say we were not disappointed. The restaurant was run in such a way that showed amazing attention to detail, from the complimentary water at the beginning to the hot beverage at the end. Service was impeccable throughout. Above all the taste of the food and the restaurant environment brought back memories of London. Luke came and introduced himself and we were amazed he remembered us!! This is a place we will definitely return and we look forward to many future visits, and we are excited to see what Luke will bring to the restaurant scene in Singapore. W &

The Kitchen at Bacchanalia is located on the cozy Hong Kong Street, alongside many fantastic bars such as Vasco and 28HKS. As a frequent diner at this restaurant, my evening at Bacchanalia was still very memorable. Each dish on the new 8-course Chef's menu was a delight! My favourite would have to be the Grassfed Tenderloin. Chef Luke Armstrong was also very hospitable and personally walked around to make sure that everyone was enjoying their meals. Thank you team
5
Extremely fresh, delicious and relaxing experience. The 5 course set menu was well balanced, beatiful and full of great tastes. New Chef was very friendly and as well the entire staff. They created very cozy atmosphere for the evening. Top dinner experinece in our 7 days holiday in Singapore
5
Took my Mum & Dad for a pre Xmas dinner. With a new head chef on-board, Luke, and supported by his team of old hands, it didn't disappoint.A dish of only carrots surprised and delighted, a hamchi on toast left us wide eyed in amazement, then a monk fish fish that stole the show... until the beef cleverly served with mandarin arrived and my mum actually squeaked with happiness. I don't have the words to do this justice, but pls take it from me, The Kitchen @ Bacchanalia is superb.Great staff - smart, entertaining, proactive - guided a fabulous culinary experience to a memorable end; and in this case a glowing review.Can't wait to return

I had heard lots of hype about This place I was not very impressed. Service was good but food did not leave a lasting impression.
5
I came to this restaurant not knowing anything about it. It was a pleasant surprice, we were welcomed in a very personal way and the whole experience was with a personal strike. The food came in a good flow which can be Â¨difficult when you get many dishes. I love the different tastes and that most of the food comes from their own organic farm up north
4
As regular visitors to Singapore we had visited the original Restaurant (in the Masonic building) on several occasions - a real find.We followed, Ivan the Chef, to his new place and he has lost none of his passion for good quality food. This is a very small restaurant so, don't be put off by that and try to get one of the tables nearest the kitchen (open to view) to watch Chef and his team preparing your meal. Ivan has a Michelin Star and that says it all.Singapore is one of those places with plenty of fine dining experiences but, this is one place not to miss
5
Just had a wonderful lunch at the Kitchen at Bacchanalia. Their set lunch menu is great value - the food was absolutely delicious, with the most intense flavours, and the service was excellentThe food is prepared in full view of the customers, and the only problem is making a choice when everything on the menu is temptin
5
For a one Michelin star restaurant, the prices here are very reasonable. We enjoyed all courses of our food especially the carrot dish. Who knew you could make carrots so many different ways. Also, I really loved the bread and dip to kick off the meal! Yum

...because you will be eating in the kitchen. We had the 5-course dinner. It started in an extremely promising way, then kind of went downhill. The amuse-bouches are outstanding, especially the 'vegetable sweat' brimming with goodness. The coconut risotto made with rice aged for 2.5 years is full of complex and surprising flavours. The chocolate pasta is intriguing, but its richness and that of the egg overwhelm the uni - a bit of a waste of good urchin. The protein dishes are good and interesting, but not more, in fact a bit confusing because too many textures and flavours. Dessert is just an afterthought. Overall, a stimulating experience. You have to be a fat cat to dine at a restaurant helmed by two Fat Duck alumni, but prices are still reasonable given the quality; portions are small so little risk of growing fat
5
My friend has always raved about The Kitchen at Bacchanalia but cause I procrastinate, my husband and I only got around to trying the food just a couple of weeks ago. After we were done, we wished we had visited them sooner. A lot of times, you eat without being completely aware of what you're consuming and the point of a meal becomes more about socialising with your loved ones. But at The Kitchen at Bacchanalia, the food's so flavorful that when you eat it, you are forced to be present in that moment, to enjoy every bite of your food, and the food then inadvertently becomes the focal point of your conversation

Was bowled over and we are still talking about our experience this morning wishing we could go back for breakfast! The first impressions of the restaurant took a dip. This was because of my expectations of what a M. Starred restaurant should look like as the restaurant is relatively small and designed in a functional way as if eating in your kitchen at home - and this is the deliberate design concept. But any misgivings went out of the window as the food started to flow. We wanted something special to celebrate my mother's pending 75th birthday and this is what we got - she said it was the nicest dinner she ever had. We went for the 5 course and I can't wait to come back to try the 7 course menu. All the staff were very welcoming and Julius in particular made our evening a real pleasure.

A very pleasant restaurant with creative dishes that use unconventional ingredients such as keluak and sunchoke that blended harmoniously to please the palate. My lunch main dish was seared barramundi fish with red sauerfraut (chopped pickled cabbage) with grilled figs was great, it would be even better if the source was served a bit more generously and the fish could be slightly less over-cooked.The all carrots starter was very well prepared with sophisticated combination of taste to make one forgotten that it was a carrot dish.The chocolate and grapefruit tart dessert was delicious except that the portion served was a bit tiny.Overall, a very enjoyable healthy lunch with my happy guests. This was my third visit in less than 4 weeks

Stellar service! Staff explain everything well, service is prompt and friendly. Very professional. You must order the bread, it is good but the butter that comes with it is delicious! Actually the favorite part of my meal. Rest of the dishes were good - above average but not quite meriting a VERY good. Reasonable for Singapore prices
3
Of course the restaurant is nice and good. But when you compare with other Michelin one star restaurant you are a little bit disappointed. There is no big stunning and surprising course. The personnel is very welcoming.
5
Great food and service. Had a marvellous evening.
Each dish had a theme and each of them brought in some surprises. The coconut risotto was the most memorable. It has a sense of familiarity yet packed with so much complexity with every bite.
4
Enjoyed my dinner at Bacchanalia very much, nice wine pairing and friendly service. Chinese mushroom salad is a must try!
5
We recently celebrated my fiancé's birthday at Bacchanalia. Food was fantastic, service was excellent and ambiance was great. We tried their coconut risotto and loved it!
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone anytime!

Market friends invited us to lunch to catch up. It's a new place to me and tucked away along Hong Kong st which used to be a street occupied by dried seafood traders of abalone sea cucumber and sharks find.We tried the lunch set with starter of carrots done in 5 ways. Very healthy indeed for me as I like salads. The mains available were beef, fish or chicken. I chose beef. It was medium rare and still quite tender. Dessert was chocolate tart with ice cream on top. Food was served in small portions. Ok for ladies or light eaters but I think it will not be enough for guys with larger appetites.Service was good and attentive. The staff introduced to us each dish served. Something practiced by posh restaurants I guess. Overall it was a great meal and time with friends.
5
My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner at the Kitchen at Bacchanalia. What I liked most is that most dishes were different from you would see in some other restaurants. For example, one of the starters was a carrot dish, which was basically carrots done in a different way. It sounds a bit boring but actually it was quite an exciting one :). My main course was chocolate pasta, which had quite an interesting and surprising taste. The atmosphere is quite nice too, the restaurant is not too big and cosy. The cooks would occasionally come to our table to present dishes. I definitely recommend this restaurant. It was also not too expensive for a Michelin star restaurant
5
Last night I thoroughly enjoyed the 7 course menu At Bacchanalia in Hong Kong street with 2 gentlemen Adam and John.We had a fantastic night, the food and service were first class, the flavours of the food distinctive and unique and the company a lot of fun.What I thought was a highlight though was that we had a range of different staff explaining each of the courses with such pride and energy, made us feel special
4
A friend of mine highly recommended this well-hidden gem to me, so I straight-away opted for a 5-course lunch menu and wasn't disappointed. Meat & fish quality are exceptional and done to a turn. I especially loved the risotto and the beef tenderloin. Portions are tiny but well presented. For my taste, some sauces were focused too much on bitter ingredients like espresso, mustard leaves and local nuts, but I guess using unusual tastes is part of the inventive cooking approach. Overall an interesting experience
4
We just had dinner with some business colleagues. Singapore has so many new restaurants and many of the highly rated establishments are mainly French-Japanese cuisineIvan Brehm had decided to take a different adventurous approach combining western and local flavours. As a result some of the courses may taste unusual to the palate but credit has to be given for his attempt to try something new.I hope he will continue to experiment with his new creations and I look forward to his new Singaporean cuisine in the futur

I initially booked this restaurant prior to the release of the Michelin star rating. I chose it for its location, menu and open kitchen setting... I'm sure a higher TripAdvisor rating is on the way.The restaurant is an exceptional experience, the decor, the style and although the kitchen is open to the dining area, it all just works.We opted for the tasting menu, and well, it was phenomenal. The quality of the produce, the preparation, the flavours and the speed of service were all top shelf. The different chefs bringing the course and explaining it made the food experience so much better. All of the staff were amazing.We decided on beer with dinner, seemed appropriate, so I can't comment on the wine selection... The beer was great!This restaurant, whilst I had expectations prior to arriving, was a real surprise of our Singapore holiday and exceeded my expectations.My understanding is that they have a seasonal menu and is about to change. This makes it a great place for revisits.I only hold a few restaurants in the revisit category, this is certainly one of them
5
Took a friend here to celebrate a semi-milestone birthday. She's vegetarian, and its amazing how difficult it is to find nice restaurants with good veg options in Singapore. I read someplace that Bacchanalia offers one of the best vegetarian tasting menus on the island -- we were not disappointed. Cobbled together with all the veg items on the menu, we had a great 5-course dining experience. Many of the dishes were made with fresh ingredients from the restaurants farm in the Cameron Highlands, and it was clear when the Chef came to describe a few of the dishes that great care was taken to construct the menu. Service was friendly and approachable. I'm not a vegetarian, and I think I will have to bring my husband, so I can try some non-veg options as well -- a few of the dishes I spied looked really tasty. Definitely recommend for a special occasion
5
No white table cloths, casual and contemporary feel. We sat at the front table, so really did feel like we were in the kitchen. We went for the five course set menu and didn't regret it. If you're wondering if it's enough food, it's plenty. With pallet cleansers and little extras, our group of four were very satisfied.The highlights for me were the coconut risotto and the iberico pork. Reading the ingredients, you wonder how it's going to work, but that is the mastery. The chef doesn't let the eclectic mix of ingredients overtake the flavour and experience, it all seems to work.One in our party was not drinking alcohol and the waiter took a great deal of time making him special non-alcoholic drinks. Service was great....and it's always nice when the chef comes to say hello, very decent indeed.We will be back.Our bill was about SGD$800 for four, which included two bottles of wine and we all had the 5 course set menu.
5
We passed by the storefront and saw lively, animated, dedicated food preparation going on and we were instantly drawn. After walking around a bit more we both agreed that we had to go back to 39 Hong Kong Street. We were seated and we selected the 5-course tasting menu. The staff was extremely passionate about their offerings and we were blown away by the level of quality, presentation, and authenticity in the dishes we were served. We were told that the restaurant has a roof garden from which many of their ingredients are sourced. This was truly a delightful experience in the midst of our honeymoon trip
4
This is a fantastic place. The food is both fantastic in taste and a delight for the eye as well. Make no mistake! All the dishes we had in the five course menu were at delight for the taste buds.The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is the ambiance. The place wasn't crowded on a Saturday evening, but not not empty either. The open kitchen is awesome. It gave a cool atmosphere of what goes on. Openness!The overall lighting is to my liking too bright. Slightly clinical! We liked the "storytelling" about the food, the ingredients and the dishes origins when the staff presented the them with passion
3
I couldn't disagree with the reviewers more on Bacchanalia. Great and accommodating service, hip ambience, bonus points for creativity but too many misses on my 5 course dinner tasting menu to warrant higher accolades. After all, we are reviewing a restaurant for the quality of food served right? It was a 50 percent hit and 50 percent miss leaving me dissatisfied, wanting and wondering about my experience. Scallops with cocoa? Beautifully tender Iberico pork with a bitter dandelion sauce? Even the complimentary 7 vegetable soup with parsley oil left me scratching my head (it just tasted of celery and I hate celery)
5
cannot give enough praise to this little gem of a restaurant. Only a small amount of tables so an intimate experience whilst eating. Had the five course tasting menu it was all delicious with some nice little courses in-between. What was extra special is how friendly the head chef is, he came over and spoke to us and even better he booked us a table in a awesome cocktail bar down the road and escorted us there. It is not often the head chef will take time to come and talk to his guests. A must place to eat for all the foodies out there
5
Having been to the original restaurant several times and never having been dissapointed, I was keen to see if the new setting delivers the same food and service. We were not dissapointed. The food was immense as expected and the wine pairing was fantastic, especially with the addition of Sake and a Whisky cocktail that shows real insight to the tastes on offer. It's a much more modern feeling place now and you literally watch the chefs cook and plate your food in front of you. My only small grumble would be that one of our waitresses was quite happy to cut in mid sentence when she brought the food to the table. It would be polite to wait nxt time and then explain what the food is. Other than that it was excellent all round
5
First time visiting since they moved location and we were not disappointed. Had the 5 course tasting menu which was gorgeous - 3 amuse bouche before the meal, with palate cleanser before dessert, but still dont feel overly stuffed which is great. My husband and friend had the wine pairing which wasnt actually just wine - sake was one of the pairings and there was a whiskey sor for dessert - they both raved about it. As i am pregnant i asked for a mocktail, and despite there not being any on the menu it was no trouble to create me something lovely on the spot - very impressed! Staff were knowledgeable and professional, no complaints. My favourite was the black sesame cake for dessert - so yummy with the vanilla cream and the guava sorbet
5
Coming to Bacchanalia was at the top of my list trip to Singapore at the end of 2015, and it did not disappoint. We chose the seven course menu, which began with bread, dip and a broth. All sensational! Then three tasting spoons, one with beef tartare, one with a scallop wafer concoction and another with a delicious beetroot purÃ©e. The main courses then started, first with a carrot, hummus and dukkah dish- I've never seen carrot done so many ways and it was all delicious, particular the carrot sponge cake and carrot jam.Our second dish was coconut curry with burrata cheese and smoked tomato, which was the sweetest most delicious curry I've ever eaten. This was followed with a snapper ceviche, the one dish I was quite wary of to begin with as I generally don't like ceviche. I needn't have worried as it was up there as one of my favourite dishes of the night.There was then a sous vide poached chicken dish with reconstructed melted cheese followed by iberico pork loin. Two incredibly delicious meat dishes that were just impossibly good.This was followed by two desserts, a caramel poached heirloom pineapple and a grapefruit and bitter chocolate tart. Wow! I'm a dessert girl and these were the best I've ever had. This wasn't a cheap meal (around $AUD400 for two seven course menus plus one wine for me and two beers for my partner) but it was worth every cent. I've never had such a good meal before and I don't think I'll have another quite as good unless I come back to Singapore. I really loved how each dish was presented and explained to us and both the food and service was impeccable. It was great watching the food being prepared right in front of me - it really makes you appreciate the love and care that goes into this kind of food. Thank you Bacchanalia for such a great nigh out - I loved every single bite

Bacchanalia has moved to their new location at Hong Kong Street from their previous location at The Masonic Club and they have definitely outdone themselves in terms of food, restaurant's interior and experience.Though they have a smaller space at Hong Kong Street, the team has done a job well done working around it. With an open concept kitchen (even with a dedicated space where they prepare the dessert), the restaurant is well designed and make one feels intimate; like they are dining with the chefs.The food were very innovative and of course, exquisite. To be honest, I am those who usually skipped on the bread basket, but I was seen asking for more this time. They served the bread with the first starter - Cheesy Polenta. At that moment when I took my first bite of it, I knew my taste buds were in for a treat (and so is my tummy) for the night. It was absolutely amazing. Another dish that left an impression that night is definitely the Carrots 4-Way. Like the bread basket, i'm not a fan of carrots but after having that dish it changed my perception of carrots. They were brilliantly done up and it tastes exceptional! The other dishes were delectable as well - Vegetable Stock Soup, Coconut Risotto, Hierloom Pineapple, etc...).Lastly, the staffs who worked there were friendly and helpful; making sure that everything is in order. Most importantly, they made us feel welcome.All in all, it was a very delightful experience for me. If you've not been, I'll advise to not just take my words for it and go experience it yourself
5
WE very much liked the food as well as the personal atmosphere of this restaurant including meet and greet with the Chef. Excellent

Very innovative menu
The starters and small bites were very good
The mains were average
The wine list was restrictive

There are many fine restaurants in Singapore; this is one of the finest. My husband and I dined there last week for for 8 course "4 Hands" dinner featuring the talents of Ivan Brehm and guest chef Hideaki Sato of Hong Kong's Ta Vie . That was a mind blowing experience of deliciousness as one might have expected. But, equally delectable was the mid week 3 course dinner offered at a reasonable price point by Singapore standards which my visiting family and I enjoyed the month before. Whether 8 courses or 3 - the dishes are innovative, fresh and beautifully presented - sometimes even taking one's breath away. I love the coconut risotto, "Bread and Broth", black sesame almond cake and assam tea ice cream. The "textures of mangoes" is essentially heaven on a plate. The main courses are all good. The environment is simple but elegant and modern. Because the staff seems so committed to making sure that the diner is having a good experience, the open kitchen format works really well. Chef Ivan Brehm sets the tone with his graciousness and desire to create a delicious and unique experience
5
The food at Bacchanalia is delicious, and chef Ivan Brehm really knows his way with flavour.The atmosphere is great too, and I enjoy the fact that you can watch the chefs prepare your food in their open-concept kitchen. Being able to see the care they take in preparing your meal adds even more value to the experience. I'd particularly recommend the HD Scallops.The wait staff is also very attentive. I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again
4
The restaurant is an open kitchen which means that many seats are bar-stool height. This gives an informal ambience and the seating is a little uncomfortable. But the cooking here is good. Took the seven course tasting menu with beverage pairing and they accommodated my guest who does eat cheese. The carrot dish was technically very complicated (to my mind) but I really enjoyed the different tastes and textures. The coconut risotto was excellent. Duck was delicious with an asian fusion theme going on and the beef was perfectly cooked and delicate. Onion soup was good but didn't blow me away and desserts were fairly unmemorable although a chocolate tart was nice. What I was disappointed with was the beverages. They do try and do some innovative things with cocktails and rice wine but frankly I think a couple of bottles of decent wine from the wine list would have been more to our liking (we had one at the end anyway). The whole thing is a bit pricey for the informal atmosphere and the food was good but not utterly amazing. But I think the restaurant is worth another visit - so four stars
4
It's a true treat to your palate, the food was an excellent explosion of very well balanced flavours. Congratulations to Ivan the chef to put together such an immense variety of ingredients in such an outstanding way- well done. The service and sympathy were excellent a very good customer service
5
Bacchanalia is probably my best experience in Singapore. We have been to severals nice restaurant but this one, was really amazing. The food, the setting, the staff, nothing to blame. I didn't know most of my dishes the only thing that I can say, the food was excellent and tasteful. Thank you for this great moment 
5
Was recommended by a good friend of the owner in Melbourne as was NOT disappointed.Each dish was superb and with excellent matching wines a wonderful repast was had.Really friendly and knowledgable staff only enhanced the experience.Whilst not the cheapest eating in Singapore it is reasonable when considering the high quality.This is to be put of one's good eating in Singapore list
5
I Don t know from where do i have to start.It is one of the best food experience so far in Singapre if it is not the best.The food is just amaaaaaaazing for:1: Quality of the food2: Presentation 3: Taste and regarding taste it is like an explosion that will touch your heart&mind and will be unforgettable.4: Price: as for the singaporean market it is very affordable for what you will get as tasting menu.And I was really surprised about the service staff are sooooooo attentive explain you every dish and always around you.Thank you for this great experience We will be back for sure
4
We tried the SGD110, 5 courses menu, for a romantic dinner date.Food was excellent with interesting flavors, friendly service and we will definitely call it value for money for what we got. Same type of fine food at RSW or MBS would cost you far more!We will definitely come back, one of our best dinner experiences of the year.Why we rated it very good but not excellent!? Let's be picky then:- atmosphere was slightly too noisy as it is a narrow small restaurant, could be more cosy- food was slightly too heavy (too creamy maybe), if you finish all dishes you might feel too full, could be better balanced- waiter always forgot to refill our glass of wine, needed to remind every 20mn which should not be the cas
5
A really fantastic experience. Mark and the team took time to explain each dish, it's background, ingredients and construction. A delicious, entertaining and educational way to dine! Highly recommend the house cocktails as well.
5
And the best (among many Michelin stars) was the 2 * Restaurant Facil in Berlin!I went with my wife and our son. The space is small and minimalist, with the work happening right among the diners. We had the 8 course DG, without the matching wines - the wine list was too tempting to ignore, although in true Singapore mode, outrageously expensive.The staff were very happy to change dishes to satisfy individual dislikes (idiosyncrasies). That for me is a major plus in a restaurant that offers only 5 or 8 course DG as menu choices.Every dish we had was superb. To nominate the coconut water/milk risotto as the absolutely outstanding dish of the night does a huge disservice to all the others. And the additional bites, 2 before the savoury courses and 2 more before the sweet, were equally brilliant.The staff were helpful and friendly, and the service was great.The only complaint relates to the generosity of the portion sizes - they wee so large (bearing it was an 8 course DG) that the tummies were groaning at the end.Regardless, this is an absolute must if you love really good and unusual food, really prepared and served.A real winner
5
Our meal was so good that I begged to meet the chef afterward and then begged him to hire me to wash dishes so I could eat there everyday. The burrata cheese is amazing. The French Onion Soup was to die for and the wine... talk about food orgasm here. Please go. And take me with you
5
Dinner at this restaurant was a truly special affair. We expected to wait a couple of weeks to get a reservation but decided we could not wait hence we took a 6pm seating which was available a week in advance. We had the full works, and had the seven course menu. However, there was a special beetroot dish from the Christmas menu, and they allowed us to swap one of the appetisers as my wife really really likes beetroot.Every dish was explained carefully to us by the waiters and they were very polite and not condescending, even with some of my casual novice questions. We paired our dinner with half a carafe of red wine which was recommended by the sommelier and the wine went very well with of food.Every dish was a surprise and delight to enjoy and when we reach the protein dishes, we were surprised that they were all cooked in a sous vide method . The chicken was very tender and juicy and looked almost like a fish dish presentation. There were some pre-desserts which came as a surprise and we were really feeling quite full but still enjoyed everything.By 7:30 PM, when we finished our meal, the energy and vibe of the restaurant had certainly increased and I was actually quite glad we took the earlier timing and had the peace and quiet to enjoy the special dinner. The bill came up to $450 for two people, but it was one of the most memorable dinner that I have tasted. Certainly worth a try and best to save for a special occasion. :) Go try it out and hope you found this helpful!
5
Thoroughly enjoyed a dinner at Bacchanalia the other night - and enjoyed the tales the waiters told about each dish. There's a friendly atmosphere in the restaurant; and there were a few times where conversations spilled over from the adjacent tables (and vice versa); and the occasional laugh could be heard. Good food, nice friendly atmosphere ... will definitely go back
4
Food was what I would describe as a bit pretentious. Seem to be doing strage things for the sake of it. You expect a little pretentiousness in a place like this so all good on that front. Food was very tasty, but small (as expected with a 5 or 7 course meal), and atmosphere was quite casual. Staff were knowledgeable about their produce and wine
4
So the idea is that the food is being prepared all around as you eat. A little of pretense because one can't do heavy duty cooking outside the kitchen. Even then it does the place seem very full of life which is nice. Service was truly excellent. One waiter introduced the food so nicely with his personal opinions on the food. Another waiter paid so much attention to the details and really kept wiping and cleaning Food was good but not memorable at all. There was the carrot in different forms - different but not delicious. The main was with Pork interesting sauces. So essentially all the food were different, not bad but not wonderful either.
5
One of the best fine dining experiences in Singapore! The casual atmosphere where every dish - or should I say creation - is prepared in front of your eyes, is very warm and welcoming. The service is excellent as every dish is explained expertly and tickles your curiosity before starting the amazing journey of tasting the most unusual combinations which turn out to be absolute genius like the tomato burrata dish complemented by a rasberry and curry foam. I cannot omit my great enthusiasm for the carrots dish which is a pure explosion of flavours and spices like cumin and cardamom! It goes without saying that the wine/cocktail pairing is exceptional and astonishes by its variety and again unexpected combinations
5
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long to get around to writing this review, due to extended holidays and business trips, but I can honestly say that my meal at Bacchanalia was one of the best I've ever had in my whole life - just thinking about it makes me smile dreamily!My wife and I booked a meal here in early September, and were granted a table near the chefs' workstation just a few days after Bacchanalia moved to its new location on Hongkong Street (the "soft opening") - huge thanks to Alejandro for arranging this for us. I can't compare this to the previous incarnation of the restaurant as we were here on holiday from the UK and this was our first trip to Singapore, but the new location was easy to find, being a short walk from Hong Lim Park - definitely check out the excellent cocktail bar at number 28 before or after your visit here!We chose the five course chef's menu (I had requested a vegetarian version at the time of booking, which Bacchanalia were more than happy to accommodate) and a bottle of champagne. Matthew, the sommelier, is a key member of the team and was happy to talk about his selection of wines, and all the staff delivered the highest quality service; "passion" is the word I'd use to describe their approach to their work, and it comes across in their attention to the smallest details in service and presentation. The head chef is Ivan Brehm; he personally introduced each dish to us as it was served, and explained the key ingredients and how they were brought together on our plate. He has a wonderfully calm style and leads by example, mentoring his staff and elevating those around him with his devotion to quality.So...onto the food. Our first surprise was a distillation of vegetables - yes, a distillation, concentrating each ingredient's most profound essence in a sublime rendering, the likes of which I've never before experienced. This was followed by the first listed item on our menu: carrots with duqqa, cream cheese and carrot jam, the carrots cooked to sweet, tender perfection. It's hard to pick highlights from the following dishes, but exquisite wild mushrooms and a truly phenomenal cold-pressed coconut cream risotto with chili paste (which worked beautifully with our rosé champagne) were perhaps my personal favourites, whilst my wife loved the iberico pork with dandelion purée, walnut butter, balsamic and tarhana. Dessert was a delicious black sesame and almond cake with guava sorbet, coconut butter and soursop jelly.Words really cannot do justice to our evening at Bacchanalia, so I'll finish by offering heartfelt thanks to all the staff for an evening which will live long in our memories. We loved it so much we stopped by the next day to offer a bunch of flowers as a small token of our appreciation! If you're in Singapore, you simply MUST visit Bacchanalia, where you will experience the finest cuisine, prepared with devotion, and served with love

In the move from Armenian Street to Hong Kong Street, Bacchanalia lost all the gentlemen's club trappings and turned all Nordic wood and stainless steel. It's elegant enough, but the food-prep area requires staff on both sides of the counter, which means mingling with the diners, and it spills over to the opposite side of the room next to the register too.It's a bit cold to be called a romantic space, but it's clean and classy and would work well for business lunches.The food is excellent and the kitchen is still doing some exciting things with textures and flavours. And of course it's all beautifully plated. We had 3-course set lunches, which is not really a great way to judge a restaurant's menu, but each course had something interesting to talk about. Service is excellent. Drinks are pricey.To be honest, there are a lot of restaurants doing on-par (and similar) food to this in Singapore at the moment. Ambiance sets them apart, and I think at this price-point Bacchanalia's ambiance lets them down. It just doesn't have very much warmth and the food service layout isn't working. An open kitchen is one thing, but a kitchen that spills onto the dining floor is another
5
Second visit at Bachanalia HK St. The menu has already changed. The 5 course menu started with baby lettuce, believe it or not! It came with so much flavor that I forgot what it is served with! Then warm curry burrata, fantastic and of course my favorite from the old location, the scallops, now served with caviar. The beef from Ireland and the chocolate desert with grapefruit jam are to die for....As always, staff is very attentive and we got Ivan/Mark the two chefs checking on us several time.The manager even shared with us they will soon be serving Grand Crus wines by the glass thanks to a new instrument/machine they just bought; i forgot the name.... Cant wait although I am a fan of the house wine by the carafe; so French haha.All in all, one of my favorite restaurant in Singapore and for that level of food and service, $115 is a bargain.Thank you guys, see you soon
4
I'd been to Bacchanalia in it's old home (and loved the whole dark, leathery club-feel) and was eager to see how the new premises worked, so booked for a romantic lunch.The new fit-out is light, bright and clean, all blond wood and no tablecloths. The food is extraordinary (though tending toward the pretentious, perhaps?) with delicious flavours and amazing textures. Presentation is also just plain beautiful. Justifiably, the prices are well up there - we had the 5 course set lunch ($115++) and the wine list is also very expensive. And yet...... you are placed in a noisy, highly lit cafe setting. The juxtapositon sat oddly with me. The beauty and detail of the food got a little lost in the surrounding noise and bustle.Our wait staff were warm and friendly, though we were rushed through the first two courses whilst still sipping our cocktails, we had a lovely chat with Ivan and it was indeed a memorable meal. I just wish it looked a little less like somewhere I'd go for a coffee and cake
5
One of the best Meals I have had off late without being overcharged. Enjoyed the detail in each course and the staff take you through the courses. Kudos and will def be back. Cheer
2
Found the whole experience rather pretentious with not much follow through interns of quality of food. Pathetic wine list. Very expensive . In my view just nonsense 
4
The biggest kick comes from listening to Ivan and the chefs and waitstaff introduce each dish so that one's palate and soul eagerly anticipate the creative mixture of flavours in every dish offered in the menu. Though the dishes aren't exactly unforgettable, the explanation of how each dish was prepared (primarily molecular), and how each ingredient was chosen makes interesting conversation over dinner. We took the five-course menu that costs 115SGD/head and started the meal with a glass of crisp white. In terms of cuisine, I may tend to prefer the creations at the kitchens of Joel Robuchon in London and Roppongi; however, for the total experience (by the way, service was warm and attentive), I may recommend Bacchanalia
5
Very nice diner at the new Bacchanalia. Modern feel, bright and right into Ivan's kitchen. What a treat to see the team preparing our 7 courses dinner plus the numerous amuse bouches and pre desert. I like the wine by the carafe so we could try several during our diner (i drink a lot!)Ivan's inspiration is pretty wide so all dishes surprised you. 7 courses menu is excellent cause you leave not hungry but also not in a food coma mode, so you can enjoy the rest of your evening.Highly recommend the new place. Book early as I got lucky yo get a couple of seat for my girlfriend and myself on a busy Saturday night. Thank you Ivan and the rest of the team who are all very knowledgeable. We will be back
5
First visit at the new Bacchanalia. Tried the 7 course set dinner (we did not know ala carte was only available from 9pm but it suited us). Great service, attentive friendly staff and the head chef personally explained some dishes to us. Ambience was pretty casual now that the restaurant has an open kitchen, yet it is chic enough for one to dress up for a meal. Loved the scallop and caviar, risotto was inventive and the tiramisu dessert was a crackle of surprise - very sweet finish to the meal. Would love to be back
5
I have been to Bacchanalia a few times at the old site and have just been again to the new site in Hong Kong Street. I don't think there is a restaurant like it in Singapore.Fantastic open plan kitchen with a relaxed vibe and no more than 40 odd covers for a true gastronomic experience. Ivan Brehm, the head chef, has nailed this one. The food is so unique and each dish is introduced to you at the table by the chefs with a story about the creation and what ingredients are used adding to the whole experience.The 5 or 7 course tasting menu is incredible value for Singapore standards and a must try. I was already planning my next business client meal before I had finished and got the bill!I can't recommend the coconut milk risotto or the blackcurrant barramundi enough, truly some of the best food I have ever eaten

We picked Bacchanalia on the basis of the owners C.V's and their approach to whole art of food and cooking and we were not disappointed. 7 dishes of pure craftsmanship, invention and pure love of the whole art of cooking.Just to be clear they are now at 39 Hong Kong Street, so the evening was combined with a visit to 28 Hong Kong Street an equally impressive cocktail barThe style of the restaurant is more cafe than 'Fine dining', some people may not like this, but we found it refreshing and unpretentious and anyway you are there for the food!I can only describe the faire as sublime, and the meal the best I have had; and yes we had been lucky enough to experience restaurants such as the Fat Duck, La Gavroche etcWe were celebrating with 2 friends a 25th wedding anniversary and a 50th birthday and although the restaurant was aware of this, not once was it overtly acknowledged. Instead we got the best table in the restaurant and watched as the dishes were prepared and plated. Each dish was explained by Mark one of the owners. A subtle and original way of acknowledging both occasions and making the evening even more special, The service was attentive and friendly without being OTT just the way it should be.Simply a great evening. Thank you Mark and all of your team, we are still smilin

Went there with the mrs and another couple. What an experience!It was on the Saturday of the F1 weekend and it was a degustation menu with a collaborating chef from Farang in Stockholm. An amazing experience seeing Ivan, Mark and the crew work their magic in the totally open kitchen. The interaction between the chefs and the patrons is like nothing I have seen before.The food of course was stupendous and the wine a fine accompaniment.This is a true proof that haute cuisine doesn't need to be stuffy. It is approachable, relatively casual, but excellent!
