We stopped for drinks at his cafe . Slightly disinterested waiting staff and some drink menu items not available . Fairly average experience.

Decided to head down to Wa-Cafe after church. Place was pleasant and comfortable. We ordered the omu rice (wife) and curry rice with pork (myself). We found the food to be delicious and portions generous. Waiting staff were attentive and cheerful.

Love the ambiance here. I love their salmon baked rice, so melted and very yummy and the salmon was good.. They have best toast ever with red bean and matcha ice cream.

Have actually been here many times for coffee and dessert - always good.My local friend enjoyed her Matcha Latte and I had the iced Matcha Latte - we shared the Matcha Honey Toast icecream - that was really good.We came in after dinner nearby - a nice contrast in taste to spicy food - recommended if you are near Chinatown Point

Ordered their Blend Coffee to kill some of my coffee urge. The presentation of it looks rather cool and very very aromatic. I am quite impressed by it. The ambience is quite cosy and rather comfortable. Sound music playing in the background and not too noisy. A very recommend place to chill, daze or even a discussion. A good mixed of cushioned seats and rather comfy. The service staff is quite friendly as well

Visited Chinatown Point mall again today and couldn't resist dropping into WA-cafÃ© for an afternoon cappuccino and matcha ice-cream....not bad at all while relaxing before some Sunday shopping.All the ice-cream dishes are tempting... I will definitely return for a third time on my next trip to Singapore

Found this restaurant near the Chinapoint SMRT entrance - after shopping in the mall I returned for a coffee and dessert.After browsing the dessert menu I saw the Honey Toast bread with Matcha and icecream....previously enjoyed this dish in Hangzhou in three months ago.The outer crust is toasted then buttered with honey, the middle of the bread scooped out with icecream, red beans and matcha as the filling.Staff explained the dish before ordering, service was quick which was appreciated.If you haven't tried this dish....it is recommended....share with a dining companion as it is a good sized portion

I found the 2nd branch of this restaurant, by chance, in one of sunny days on the island. I got myself a glass of iced cafe latte and shared a big honey toast topped with matcha ice-cream with my friends. The toast is not the best I have ever had. But the mini moji, came with the toast, made it unique and fun to eat.Worth a try

Free wifi, Power plug, No service charge, Baby chairVanilla honey toast is served on a hot plate with vanilla ice-cream, banana, strawberry, blueberry and cream on a crispy toast. Sweet caramel. Filling as a meal by itself $15.80Wagyu curry is nice & tender though on a high price end as the Wagyu given is not much for the price. $26.80Omu rice is good without the taste of egg being overwhelming, close to that of Japan. Taste of the tomato rice is just right. $14.30The kid's meal has a well mix of Omu rice & spaghetti. These is only 1 selection & served in a red sports car. Accompanying is the beef patty, broccoli, corn and fried prawn, jelly and Yakult. $14.80If you feel like splurging $ with nice food still worth a visit

Wa-Cafe is an inviting and cosy restaurant. It has a nice ambience which makes dining there a pleasure. Instead of the typical chairs, we were led to sofa-like seats which was amazingly comfortable. Though we were there on a Saturday night, the place was not crowded or noisy, much to our relief.As a Japanese-styled Western eating establishment, Wa-Cafe offers the usual selections of grilled meat, burgers, pasta, baked rice, etc. Portions are not very generous but would be sufficient if one is not a big eater. Not everything (as I heard from my sister who had also dined there on another occasion) on the menu is fantastic, but what my family ordered that day did not disappoint us. My husband loved the 'Baked Rice Salmon' ($16.30). It not only had generous slices of salmon on top of the rice, but delicious chucks of chicken and potatoes 'hidden' under the rice as well. My 'Pizza Toast' ($6.80 for two slices) was done perfectly. Their 'Neapolitan Spaghetti" ($15.80) is pretty ordinary though and the serving is not much. My son loved the 'Japanese Fruit Mixed Juice" but personally I feel that it is overpriced at $8.80 per glass. There is no service charge, so what you see is what you pay as the GST has already been included in the price.Overall, Wa Cafe is a good place to dine if you fancy a nice relaxed meal at Chinatown Point
