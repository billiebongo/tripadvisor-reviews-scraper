I was expecting porn but instead got some darn good food , was expecting something completely different;)

I tried the chicken noodle soup and it's nice! Spicy alert... to me it's on the edge, perhaps a little spicier than I thought.
Also recommend their matcha milk tea for companion drink.

I ordered duck glass noodles with a cup of hot lemon grass drink. Soup is fragrance but slightly salty. I can feel the MSG in my mouth after a sip of soup. But who cares! I support Pornsak! üòÅ

Porn's Restaurant in Liang Seah street is a Thai restaurant and food are yummy. They do serve quite authentic Thais food and with good desserts.

Porn's is in a nice location with lovely staff. They do have vegetarian option although not a lot. The pad thai was avarage. I would not recommend it (the waitress did recommend the curry) the other choice was the crispy tofu which was highligthed as a favourite and it is indeed good. For vegetarian i would suggest keep on searching but i can't confess about the meat stuff

Went here based on trip advisor reviews. It's not 5 just because it's a basic cafe style with good food and excellent service. Don't go dressed up expecting a top notch restaurant. Go here if you want good value as its a bargain across whole menu. Bottle of Chang beer (only beer on offer) was 6.90 so that too is fair price. So, give it a go, I don't think it will disappoint your tastebuds but it will please your wallet!

I stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel for quite a few times. Didn't realized that there's a food street right across up till now. Stumbled upon this cute cosy porn's thai restaurant and decided to give it a try.Not very adventurous with food so i took quite a while at the menu. The waitress came to offer her help and catered to what i want. All my dishes are less spicy. great!My friends had Tom yam soup hotpot, prawn patties, green curry, mango salad and pad thai. All are authentic and tasty. Affordable too. Will be back again

Working in Singapore for 2 years. Missed Thai food a lot. Tried many Thai restaurants in Singapore. None was good, until I ate here. The d√©cor is very simple. Graffiti style. Logo is a fat elephant butt cute. Was there on a weekday evening with a bunch of friends. it was full house. Had to queue for 10 mins. The waitress was very polite.Food was terrific. They serve authentic Thai food just like back home in Thailand. Tom Yum Hotpot soup is packed with a punch. Green curry is flavourful. The Tor Mun Goong (prawn cakes) is crispy and filled with real prawns. Fried 3 flavoured fish is delicious. We wanted to try their sticky rice mango but it was sold out. Price was affordable.Will definitely come here when I miss Thai home food.

Went there as a family of 5. We stayed at Intercontinental Hotel across the street. Got attracted by the cute elephant butt logo. We ate tom yam goong, fried prawn patties, pad thai, chicken with thai holy basil leaves, garlic chicken and thai green curry. All very tasty and authentic, especially tom yam goong. One of the best Thai restuarants in town. We also relaized that this is the only non-China themed restaurant along the street. Guess they have a very strong following. Highly recommended if you are on a budget

Here for business lunch and came back again for leisure dinner. Serve food like in Bangkok. Waitress friendly and fast. Price is good. Ordered Tom Yum Prawn Hotpot, very nice, with fresh prawns and good size. The Thai steam fish, very nice, the fish fresh with good spice and herbs. Prawn cakes are very nice too, real prawn and crispy. Will come back again soon. Gambate

Food is nice, staff is great, environment not bad. We are greeted by porn's staff almost immediately we arrived. Food let me remember the taste of Thai food that I have at Phuket.

After a long flight we were put up near this small food street and there was a host of activities and eateries around the area. While most of the stalls seem to be serving some kind of regional chinese specialties; this little restaurant served thai cuisine. So when in South east asia we had to eat regional cuisine!The food was lip smackingly good. everything from the tomyumgong soup to the whole steamed fish was excellent and so aromatic. nothing like what we have back in Sweden.We sat outside to enjoy the evening breeze and the ambiance. both of which were happening and very vibrant. we loved the steamed sea bass, it was so amazingly fresh and the flavors were like an explosion in the mouth

Our great Asian escape covers Singapore, Bali and we finish off in japan, so we knew that we had to try all types of Asian cuisines while in Singapore so that we get a paste of Asia. For Thai food we chose this restaurant because of its quirky name and also because it was close to our hotel.The restaurant has a funky design and seems to be fronted by a local personality. But it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter, we were here for the food. We ordered a few dishes, of course, tom yum (red) and a few vegetable dishes and a curious fried pork dish. The food was amazingly flavorful and the aromatic herbs and spices really permeated throughout the tom yum soup. This was better than anything I have tired back home.I loved the rustic and down to earth vibe of the space! And I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a quick, and affordable dinner

We work at Bugis and during our lunch time on Jan 22 we visited the place. We ordered food by 1.10 PM and got a wrong order served by 2.45, again after 10 mins we got our order served. 40 mins to serve food? We never enjoyed the food, as we have to run back. The food was average. Not that great and the worst part they charge $5 service charge for their pathetic service. Won't visit again

Ordered a vegetable green curry with jasmine rice and a mango sticky rice for dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and came to a total of $30 for the main and dessert. Ok value and tasty curry, as well as delicious mango.Would go back as the staff were also friendly and relaxed (rare to find in a hurried city like Singapore)

I have always steer myself away from celebrity's joints as much as possible, unless there is an occasion that I have no choice but to attend, because I think they are mostly overrated and are only selling by the celeb's fame and not otherwise a restaurant should be. But this one proves me a little bit wrong.It was a hot day as usual on the island and I was just looking for a place where I can grab a drink and go. I saw a convenience store down the road but the friendly sawadee-ka lured me to look their way and I thought "why not". And I ended up with an additional order of a small finger food platter.I saw across the table and every other patrons was having quite a sumptuous order each, and even at a non peak period during the day, customers flock in non stop.I saw another bloke being lured in by the friendly welcoming chirp and was seated outside. Could see he didn't have the intention to dine to begin with from his awkward smirk.I was all impressed throughout the one hour spent there, though not at all very spacious, but the staff really make you feel at ease.Food was ok but I don't think it was fair to judge by just savouring on just a small platter, but the wings were rather tasty.Will definitely return to dine and treat myself more into this wonderful place

Came here to experience some outstanding Thai food as the name suggests. Well, food was good but not outstanding. The Tom Yum and Green Curry were too chilli hot! And a bit too clear and watery for my preference. Pandan chicken portion was a bit too small. Love the way they served their rice, very cute, but portion is small too. The restaurant is not air conditioned so in the hot balmy Singapore evening, the hot food was made worse!Location is in Liang Seah Street, just a short walk from Bugis Junction. It's a street full of heritage shops which is interesting to see and experience. There are lots of other bustling restaurants in the same street.

The place isn't air conditioned but quite airy though. Food portions were small. We ordered Kai Lan, mango salad, chilli fish, thai toufoo and grandma's prawn cakes. The best is grandma's prawn cake, must eat it while it is hot, the filling is solid. The chilli fish we tried was a little bit fishy and very salty, it was the most disappointing dish for our dinner. The rest of the food we ordered were decent but not fantastic

Heard much about it so I had to try. It would be my first and last time, probably the same for my friends who took up my choice to dine here. Sorry pals! The food was really average in taste, nothing outstanding and definitely not Sexy Food as they position themselves as. It tasted like ... well, Thai food, no wow no yummy. For the prices, mind you it isn't cheap, the dishes came really small, disproportionate for what you pay. The only fair deal was the Tom Yum Soup with more substantial portion, the rest was tiny with not much to share. We had to order many dishes to fill up and it was expensive. Now the TRASH PART. We brought a cake to celebrate a friend's birthday and the waitress was kind enough to help bring out the cake at the end for us and even took pictures. Minutes after we had the cake and blew out the candies, we asked if we could have the cake box to bring back the uneaten portion. They did but the box was wet with half eaten sausages already thrown inside the box. They actually retrieved the box from the TRASH to give it back to us! How very shocking! The waiter could have told us it was thrown away and we would understand. Now that is NOT sexy and NOT hygienic. It's so bad it's funny. Overall, it's not worth the hype on taste nor value. Please train staff to never retrieve anything from kitchen trash for customers, no matter what. I'm glad I won't be eating here again.

I had lunch here with my wife.The prices are great, and so is the food!I had green curry chicken. Lots of chicken, and really good flavor. Hot, but not too hot.My wife had some kind of spicy chicken thing and mango salad. She loved them both.She especially liked the thai ice teas we had.I like their elephant butt logo too.We will be back
