We tried vegetable soup, Mi Goreng and chilly monkey head mushroom. We also had freshly prepared fruit juices. All in all the food was very yummy.

Visited Zi Zai Vegetarian (自在斋) for lunch today. Due to warm weather, decided to sit indoor in the aircon section. Ordered the vegetarian kway chap (斋菓汁). This dish tastefully well cooked. Enjoyed this simple lunch at affordable price.

Wide selection of food with reasonable price. Have both set meal or ala cart menu to choose. Must try their curry dish. Slurp.

Brought an oversea friend who is a vegan, straight to this vegetarian restaurant from Changi Airport. We arrived at 8.20 pm and the restaurant was still full. Luckily we made a reservation for five. This humble and simple restaurant is located in and HDB area. Do not expect five stars service. Happily, we helped ourselves with the cutlery. We were seated in the air-conditioned dinning hall and was comfortable. We waited for about 10 minutes and suddenly all the food we ordered came quickly. We were amazed by how the kitchen can cook so many dishes, so quickly. The fried horfun came first. Many of us felt that it was an excellent dish. I prefer the horfun to be thinner. The sweet and sour fish has a thick gravy. The texture was perfect and the gravy tasted so good. I felt the fried carrot cake was too plain. I love the hot plate brinjal as I love brinjal. The yam ring was the second best dish of the night. It tasted so good even without meat. The best dish of the night must be the cereal tofu. The tofu has a great flavour when cooked with cereal.This is not a five stars restaurant in terms of presentation, style or service. This is a five stars restaurant for taste, price and simple enjoyment. Definitely worth a second and many more visits

Our family decided to have a vegetarian dinner and chose Zi Zai Vegetarian restaurant at Tampines. The food was decent but the service was poor. We had a seating in the aircon area and was allocated a large table and a smaller table beside it as we had 11 pax. The layout of the tables and chairs were close to each other, which was probably due to the limited spaces. Chairs were literally back-to-back, leaving no space for walking through. The waiter took our order, and our dishes were served but minor errors. Upon finishing the dinner, a cleaning auntie lamented that the children who were seated at the smaller table quickly stand up to allow seating for other customers and she was just clearing and cleaning away. We have not even finished our dinner at that point in time. I was actually very mad, took the unfinished glass of iced milo and went to the counter to have them packed it away. I also gave the feedback that it was poor customer service to have to "chase" the customers away when we have not finished dinner yet. It was really a bad experience and I would not return to this restaurant again, until such time when their customer service improved

As non vegetarian, I love the food as my first visit here. The monkey mushroom and the zi Zai soup are very delicious. Yes they take cash only and there is an UOB ATM machine at carpark if u run out of cold hard cash Enjoy

Zi Zai Vegetarian serves good food at affordable prices but the shop collects 7% GST. It's located within Tampines Neighbourhood Estate. Bus service 22 stops in front of the shop. No WiFi. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Collect order, food serve, make payment at the cashier counter after meal.The fish / mutton curry rice set ($4), Gongbao Monkey Head Mushroom ($10), Satay (5 sticks for $3.50), Braised Mutton ($8), Prata ($1 per piece) etc. These are the few good and popular dishes.Need to inform the order taker if one does not consume egg as some dishes include.Enjoyed.
