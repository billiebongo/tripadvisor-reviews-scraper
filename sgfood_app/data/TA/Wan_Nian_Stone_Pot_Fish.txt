We had a wonderful meal at this small restaurant. We didnt try the signature Stone Pot Fish, but we had a range of other dishes which were all delicious. Service was fast and friendly.

Restauran is in Chinatown in the Smith Str. I eat there salted pepper mushrooms, Eggplant with garlic sauce and dumplings. Good quality and Service. High price for this quality food.

The worst harassment. Menu and dish are different. expensive. Other noodles and fried rice of the same price had shrimp and meat, but the noodles I asked included only a few vegetables and only noodles.Yet, it was stolen for $ 7, 4 with wet towel and tax.I was deceived very much. Great failure.It was better that you ate 2 cups of plenty of fish at a stall.Great failure

We are here twice during our stay in Singapore! The food was delicious. Service was great. We are inside during our 1st visit and during our 2nd we had a party of 10. They were so accomodating as we were anted to sit outside so they brought out a huge table top to fit us all on. The food is super cheap, portions are great size. Kids (aged 8, 9and 10yrs) loved it as did all the adults. The food selection caters to all tastes! Give it a go, you won't regret it!

If you are in a decent sized group get the stone fish pot but these are too big for one or two people. These are big stone dishes, piping hot with a whole fish and soup inside plonked on your table. The other dishes though are just as good though not as unusual

We've been there two times, first time in 2016 and returned again in 2017. Back in 2016, we had chili crab and fish in a pot. Both were delicious, but too much for two persons. On our return in 2017 we took only the chili crab (+buns for the sauce) and veggies, enough for two. Still delicious. The place is small, but clean & air conditioned. Friendly staff. Good stop when visiting Buddha Tooth Relic temple or Chinatown. Would highly recommend

We called here on our one day visit to Singapore on a cruise ship. The weather was hot and humid (as I've generally found in Singapore) and with excellent air conditioning and ice cold beer, this was a haven.There was an extensive menu and wine list and we had the Gyoza and Gongbao Chicken which were both very good. Service was quick and friendly

I came here today with my friend Sky and we shared a stone pot Sea Bass.Really fantastic healthy food and no msg. Head and shoulders above the competition.The Chinese Skewers are similar in look to a satay but in taste are a mix of great flavours and herbs. Enjoy a great visit here. We did

Small restaurant with in/out seating in the middle of Chinatown. Very friendly service, extensive menu and drinks list, at reasonable cost. We had the Yam Ring, Cabbage with mushroom and steamed rice - it was amazing tucker. All good. We'll be back.Cheers Niels & Mary, Humpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Unde
