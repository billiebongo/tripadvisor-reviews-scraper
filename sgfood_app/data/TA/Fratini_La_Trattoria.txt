Vist there with my wife, the place are nice and quiet. You don't need to order the dish, so you can get more time to communicate.

Both visits were remarkable. Staff were attentive. Food was well-timed and served with staff explaining the origin of the dishes. No Menu, so be in for a surprise!

I had dinner at this place during mid week and by weekend I was back again for dinner this time with my wife.The service was exemplary and the food was out of this world.Even the time for the orders to arrive was not very long.All the staff are very knowledgeable on the menu and have perfect service for fine dining.I will return again to dine there and do recommend it although its not at central city.cheersGraham,Cronulla,Sydne

Spent Valentine’s Day at Fratini. The restaurant has no menu and you can expect to have 10-15 courses. The appetisers of warm and cold varieties were good. The wagyu steak served was amazing and by far the best dish of the night. We had the rabbit ragout which was a first but not mind blowing. Overall good good, but I think the timing between dishes could be improved. The couple owners were really pleasant and very professional, explaining each dish served. The other staff could be better in that aspect and be more attentive.

I went there with my wife to celebrate Christmas day. The staff were very nice and friendly. They try to cater to your needs. Delicious food, well prepared. At the end of the meal, they gave us a complementary dessert. A very fulfilling experience. One thing to note is, there is no public transport around this area. So you need to drive or take a taxi or else, you're gonna need to walk for quite a distance
5
It is definitively worth the trip to taste the menu decouverte of this chef. It is well composed with fresh ingrdients . He starters are stunning, i loved the soup, the meat from tuscany is fabulous and the dessert rounds it up. Just the portions are too big

Myself and my partner were so much looking forward to visiting Fratini, just over a year since our first visit.Having been before we knew what to expect to an extent.Before we ate Chomel came over to discuss with us what foods we didn’t like and asked if we had been before. She thought she recognised us which was a nice touch.For appetisers we had smoked salmon wrapped around some prawns and other fish, a scallop, beef neck and daikon with pumpkin purée and pork belly with onion sauce. All superb, but scallop was a favourite of mine.Then we moved onto lobster served in its shell. I’ve not ordered lobster for a number of years after an average experience. I found what I had been missing out on! Fantastic!We then had a monkfish fillet in olive and tomato sauce. That was beautifully cooked and was a superb piece of fish.Next course was a pork tenderloin with pineapple and grapes. An odd sounding combination but it worked superbly.The final pre pasta course was the highlight. A beautifully crisp confit leg of duck. Out of this world.We then order the truffle pasta where the portion size was perfect to complete the savoury dishes. It also tasted divine.Moving onto to dessert. Four small desserts each. A small chocolate orange bite, a very nice creme brûlée, a very nice piece of tiramisu and a truly outstanding almond panacotta. That last dessert mentioned was so good. Not too sweet. A hint of almond and perfect wobble.Thank you all for great food and excellent service. We hope to be back soon

I feel that it is absolutely ridiculous for a restaurant to serve such large portions of food that is subpar. I have visited before and the overall standard have obviously dropped. None of the food had a 'wow' feel to it and the truffle pasta tasted absolutely disgusting. I would never return
5
Nice staffs and delicious meal.
Really enjoy the time. Wine item also was good. The place which I have come back again.
5
Italian Omakase. Mind blown. Amazing food. Left this place very very full. Amazing range of reasonably priced Italian wines.
5
It was my Wife birthday, I check thru some restaurants, eventually choose fratini la trattoria as this restaurants have good reviews. The service was great and food was sufficient and nice.
5
Celebrated my wedding anniversary here and received a very special welcome from this restaurant. Chomel the owner was great and she is passionate about her work and food. She explained in detail every food served in the table . The wine selection are great with reasonable price. She has no menu and you just has to tell her what you don't eat.! Their homemade pasta with truffle and the dessert are out of the world.. must ty...She will surprise with the food of that day.. value for money and worth a visit even I have been here multiple times and yet to get sick.. lovely place
5
Fantastic food! Up there with one of the best degustation's we've ever had. They don't have a menu, which makes it very exciting. They provide you with a minimum of 10 course. Great produce, we had Lobster, Lamb Rack, Scallops, Fish, Beef cheeks, truffle pasta and some amazing desserts. Well worth the visit, a highlight in our time in Singapore

Often times when you head out for restaurant food, you will find yourself eating bits and pieces of whatever is served. You want to order more but you can't cause it's too $$$ and you might look 'greedy'. So you naturally head out to a hawker centre for a 2nd 'dinner'. There goes the calories and the dining experience.At Fratini, they know EXACTLY what makes you smile and your bellies filled! One of their core values the restaurant live by is to make sure all diners walk away with a full stomach! As the saying goes, a hungry man is an angry man. They sure know much about human psychology! In total, we tried around 12-14 dishes. That's really a lot! Of course, if you like a particular dish, you can ask for a bit more and they are more than happy to serve some extras if they have, on the house! Personally, I'm not so adventurous with food, but I felt really comfortable at this restaurant and allowed the chef to whip out whatever they have for that night with their Omakase Italian style dining. I chomped down everything on my plate. I had a great chat with Chomel and Januver after my dinner and learnt that all the ingredients, dishes are freshly prepared on the day itself. The service, of course, is top-notch. Staff are well-trained and food is served fast. Cozy experience for all kinds of celebrations. If you have a group event, they even have a private room at the back. Price wise, it's definitely worth every buck. You will definitely walk out of the restaurant with good food in your belly but still have loads of cash in your wallet. Don't have to do a bank heist on this.Once you go Fratini, you will never go back
5
Came her with a friend and had a wonderful meal. There is no menu and they just ask you if you have any dislikes or allergies. The food was excellent but for me a bit too much. We also had a wonderful wine accompanying our meal. We would love to come back one day :-
5
I suggest that you book in advance and let the staff know your dietary restrictions. The food is heavy/ big portions so fast few hours before the meal. It is a "no menu" place. The variety is unbelievable
5
Four of us for dinner. All of us liked the idea of no menu. It changes everyday according to what ingredients the restaurant sources and, one imagines, what the chefs feel like cooking on the day.  I like that sense of adventure, especially in Singapore where so many things are all planned out and inflexible. One of the chefs came over to our table to discuss what they have and asked about any likes or dislikes and dietary requirements. For me, I needed low-salt dishes and no seafood. Not a problem. The kitchen crafted individual dishes for me for some of the courses. And there was plenty of food over a series of courses, all presented on platters, all delicious. As, too, was the wine. We were a little concerned about the price and, to be honest, Fratini isn't cheap but considering the quality of the food and the very attentive service, it was well worth it. Plus, the restaurant is small, yet not crowded. I recommend the room at the back.  I think all of us will return. It was a very enjoyable evening
4
Great food. Good service. Good to be surprised and leave the cook to decide what you eat and you get the best! However, be careful when asked if you want coffee or tea cos it's not in the pricing. You pay premium price for coffee/tea. Would be nice if you are told when they ask if you wish to have coffee/tea.
5
Fantastic experience, food was excellent, good wines and great service and priced just right. Highly recommend
5
Very interesting presentation of the dishes served and the lady presenting it is very professional. True blue Italian with 3 types of Brunellos avail!

We went to Fratini La Trattoria for the first time because we heard it was one of the top five Italian restaurants in Singapore. First appetizer of four side dishes was really good. Dishes afterwards were too meat centric and too many courses. Pasta was a tad too oily and too much in portion, which led to wastage.Shocked that hot beverage is not included in the per head cost.Overall, it’s an over rated restaurant
3
Definitely an interesting experience (no menu) and “nice” food, although none of the dishes have really stuck in my mind. The dinner felt exceptionally rushed, almost as though they were trying to clear the restaurant on a Sunday evening (when it wasn’t overly busy). Sadly, I can only give Fratini an average rating
5
love the concept, the food and service are amazing. my friends and i like trying lots of different items and this restaurant certainly does not disappoint. do give yourself at least 2 hours for a leisure lunch to enjoy. location of restaurant is secluded and really good. every thing we were served was simply delicious. Because there is no menu, i suppose each visit would be an experience. the only downside is the smallness of the restaurant. the inside seating gets noisy when it's full and with the open kitchen concept. there is outside seating which was a blessing for us. we were there for lunch and there a table of 8 women seated next to us.. it was super noisy.. we had to get a table outside
5
We'd booked this for Sunday lunch not knowing that they don't have a menu. The ambience is cosy and warm.They asked our preferences and allergies and after that we just sat back. The courses kept coming one after another. First the cold appetizers, then the warm ones. Followed by main course which was the best pasta we ever had. The dessert portions were small but just right after a big meal. The tiramisu was great. This is really a great restaurant, a hidden gem
5
Love the service, the food and most of all, the unique experience of being stress-free in deciding from a menu. Just leave it in the good hands of the good people of Fratini to whip up a fantastic dining experience that suit to your needs

The food is excellent both for meat choice and vegetarian choice. No menu. You will be just served. They will ask if you have some special eating habit, anything you don't eat? There are many courses. Starter, appetizer, sea food, mutton, noodle, desert..... In total you will be served a lot. Therefore keep yourself very hungry before you go there.Some food will be served on the cutting board or wood container like in Italy. In the tropical humid & hot climate the wood board are mouldy. But all right, I am sure they used the dish washer to wash the wood board. Anyhow a little bit mould doesn't destroy the flavor.It was a bit pricy. 4 person costed 600S$. All right, besides the 3 meat choices and 1 vegetarian also 1 bottle of wine, 2 glasses of wine and 2 espresso were ordered
5
Having no menu but being treated to an absolute degustation of amazing flavours - textures and food - we had 5 out of 6 with sepcaik menu requirements - 1 being vegetarian 1- being gluten free cealoic 1 not eating crustaceans- 1 not eating seafood and 1 not eating beef - This place is amazing - You have to go there to taste the sensation Great wine - great atmosphere and seriously good food
5
came here for our anniversary, and we were blown away. there was no menu, and we were greeted by the friendly server staff instead. we were introduced to the omakase-like concept at the establishment, where they served a 7 course meal for $50++. it was by far, the best italian food we have ever had. we were surprised at the end with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary as well. the decor could have been warmer and more private, but all-in-all a good dining experience
3
Decided to check the place out because of its high TA ratings. The staff are very pleasant and polite, introducing the inspirational origins of each dish and making sure we were well taken care of. Price was fair for the amount of food we were served. One thing the restaurant should note is the cleanliness of its cutlery and water jugs as we had to change out some utensils. Also the mouthpieces of the water jugs were mouldy.Food wise, there were a few great dishes and many so-so ones. Overall we agreed that the novel menu-less dining experience was interesting but otherwise would not return.

Thanks to TripAdvisor we decided to go to Fratini La Trattoria for dinner as a group of 6. On arrival we were a fair way out of main Singapore in the Suburbs, nice little restaurant strip with a real local feel.Inside is quite nice, well presented, great wine list especially if your into your Amarone as I am :). The menu well there isn't one so a real difference for us. The waiter was unreal, took note of all dietary requirements and went about delivering a 14 course meal which was stunning.I have to say that some dishes I would never order, and because if this style of restaurant I have tried and found new tastes. Simply we loved it, ate too much and drank to much and did not eat anything I did not enjoy. If in Singapore again I will definitely go back. For those thinking of going and unsure, expect to pay between $95ea upwards, depending on your wine choice, it's not the cheapest place but for what you get and the service it is easily worth it :

We decided to have dinner at Fratini La Trattoria to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant doesn't have a menu and will take note of any dietary restrictions/allergies when you call to reserve a table. We asked for one vegetarian meal and one sans beef. They can rustle up vegan meals too.We ordered our wine and sat back to enjoy the experience - and the start was relaxing itself as you don't have to rack your brains for what to order from a huge menu! :)) There were 10-12 courses served - the portions are decent in each course and we were quite full before the desserts arrived. :) We were served each course by the co-owner of the restaurant, Mr. Januver Chow and it was amazing how he rattled off the names of the dishes, their Italian inspiration/ origin and the ingredients as each course arrived! The food was delicious and beautifully plated and there were some interesting combinations on the plates. Januver also told us that they'll create a profile for us based on our mobile number (which we gave during reservation) and the next time we make a reservation, they'll try to ensure that majority of the meal is not a repetition of what we ate that day. Fantastic and certainly makes me want to return already!It's a quaint little restaurant with wonderful service. At $95++ per pax, it's worth it as you get a fabulous meal and sample so many dishes. Would highly recommend this place for the good food and experience

Celebrated my girlfriend birthday with this degustation meal. Since there is no menu, we won't know what they will be serving. We can only choose the type of drinks we wanted. We ordered a bottle of red wine at about $70. Their red wine range from $65 to $100 per bottle. Relatively reasonable if you compared the price in any pub in Clarke Quay. The damage for the meal is about $95 per pax for a 10-14 course meal. Must say the food is fantastic. For every dish serve, the service attendant will introduce the dish and tell you how the dish was inspired or created. For food wise, will give them 9 out of 10. And the service attendant are very attentive. The plates were change twice while cutlery was change once. Could be better if they help to refill the plain water and wine more frequently. Hence for service wise, I must give them 8.5 out of 10. For ambience, will give them 8 out of 10. The decor, lighting, smell and background music were good. Nothing fancy. Only shortcoming is the noise created by plates and cutlery. Will be good if the staff can pay a little bit of attention when putting or placing plates or cutlery down. Just a little suggestion to improve the overall experience of dining there. Will definitely recommend my friends to visit
5
This is the first time at the restaurant, and we were very happy we decided to eat here. We were served a total of 15 dishes (including a special rabbit dish which the restaurant was trying out), and we all went home happy and stuffed. Ingredients were fresh and the quality of the food was excellent, esp the tender beef cheeks and rack of lamb. Definitely worth a visit.
5
Whilst I am not sure I agree with the recent number one restaurant ranking in Singapore, this was certainly a very pleasant experience. It's a little over priced but again, many degustation style venues generally are. Was not impressed with the lamb as I felt it was not cooked enough but then I think thats how they wanted to present it. Restaurant ambience was comfortable and not overly formal or upper end. Staff were polite and attentive but it all felt a little too robotic and rehearsed
5
So I am foodie. I have checked out nearly all the top restaurants in Singapore, and in other places with good food, like New York and California. Fratini La Trattoria is by far the BEST restaurant I have ever eaten in. The 13 courses served here (4 cold appetizers, 4 hot appetizers, pasta, 4 small desserts) are all just fabulous. All the items are diverse with very different flavors and textures. This will be by far some of the most complex Italian food you have ever eaten or will ever eat. I like this place so much that I bring every visitor from abroad here. In fact, I have eaten here 4 times in less than 5 weeks. However, each time, I got served totally different food, with no repetition. The chefs can accommodate all food restrictions, including vegetarian and vegan. Frantini la Trattoria is a superb gastronomic experience that won't break your wallet
5
Excellent food and excellent service! No menu was provided- seasonal fresh produce in 11 mouth watering dishes. Would definitely recommend this fine dining experience.
5
Based on the TOP ranking of the TripAdvisor , we chose this restaurant for our last dinner in the Singapore . The food was fantastic as you can enjoy the various types of Italian food . The only advise is the desert , especially Tiramisu that needs to improve the taste :)
5
The concept of the place if very unique - it's degustation/omakase of Italian food, with no menu as they change depending on availability of whatever fresh they have! I have not seen this concept in Singapore before, but it pays in spades.Apart from the pleasant surprise of the dishes that they serve (and they serve a lot of items in the course), the staff are also very knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The also offer to customize your menu based on your diet, so its possible to get a vegetarian dinner done as well.The dishes are visually interesting and presented beautifully - they taste exquisite and wholesome at the same time.The place itself has a lot of family/friends kinda vibe, but you can go here for dinner dates as well.Revisit Likelihood : Every two month
5
i love the truffle pasta and tiramisu, so exclusive.. tasty food very nice presentation too.. good service. the venue is great.
5
I came for the food, good food and nice service everything here is good
we are very happy with everything here
we will come back.
5
Food and service here was fabulous, as usual. Lovely place for a family lunch with our kids. Ingredients were well matched to surprise the palette and our favorite Beef Cheek was divine!
5
Chomel has great attention to details! Well done!
They made an attempt to remember what you have eaten before and they will avoid serving the same cuisine.
5
Booked a table earlier and was given a private corner for the table. The meal was great but they did not serve beef cheeks this round. Enjoy the truffle pasta again. This is my second visit and I will still come again
4
Very good food, but lack of price list means that there is an air of 'emperor's new clothes' about the place..
5
A group of eight dined for lunch here to celebrate a successful commercial venture. It was top shelf. The food was first class, the service warm and professional, and as we stayed to enjoy a few drinks into the afternoon the atmosphere was just right. As we left the staff helped with an Uber when the cabs were scarce. I really enjoyed it.
5
Had anniversary dinner here. Omakase style but each course was tasty and substantial. They were able to cater to one person not keen on beef and cheese, and one not keen on shellfish. Recommended
5
This was our 2nd visit and the food and service were excellent as ever. Every course was delicious and the staff were very knowledgeable about the origin of each dish and ingredients. After a selection of cold and hot appetizers we enjoyed various meat and fish dishes before choose a seafood sauce for the pasta course and finishing off with a trio of perfect desserts. Unpretentious fine dining. Highly recommended

It was meant to be a birthday celebration lunch for 2 pax at this restaurant with great reviews. However, it is a disappointing 2 hours experience.The factor that prevented me from putting a 1 star is due to the good and attentive service by the staff and some great food like cold starter, pasta and dessert.What went wrong?To start off, we were seated in the room at the back with 2 other groups (4 and 5 pax each). It was noisy at the start but after the 2 groups had a few glasses of wine, the noise became deafening until it was a challenge to have a conversation and we lost interest in talking since it became like a match of the loudest voice among people in the room. The raucous crowd is definitely not what I would expect from this restaurant.Then, the corner that we were seated is stuffy and uncomfortable. At one point, it was cold, but I suppose the table that was seated under the air-cond decided to ask the staff to adjust the temperature. Then, it became stuffy for us. So at this stage, it is extremely noisy and stuffy.Back to the food, what was traditionally Italian was done quite well and we enjoyed them, such as the Truffle Pasta, Tiramisu. Cold Starter and other dessert (Earl Grey Pudding and Chocolate) are good. However, other fusion dishes fell below our expectations. Mocha and Cappuccino that we ordered were also not great.To rub salt in the wound, the other table was served a small piece of cake with candle for birthday but we did not get a similar treatment even though when I made the booking, Birthday Celebration was selected as the occasion.Will we be back, definitely not
4
Good food, nice drinks and good atmosphere! A bit expensive but is worth it! Great dishes and tastes! We enjoyed
5
My first time to go this restaurant, no menu, but food served very good and awesome taste, the service also excellent, will go next time. Lunch set has 50% off, quite nice choice.
4
In this Italian restaurant, you can taste good wines, there is a large selection of them. Pleasant atmosphere and polite staff!
5
I planned this special farewell lunch for my boyfriend's last weekend in Singapore and both of us absolutely loved ALL of the food and the impeccable, friendly service.

Chosen this restaurant due to their offering of omakase since it was my birthday. I wanted to try things I most likely would not if I’m to pick them off the menu. We were informed that there’s is no menu in this restaurant upon seated and the server enquired if we have any dietary requirements that they need to take note of. We do not have so bring it on. The dishes were all inspired by different regions of Italy. Meat dishes like lamb and beef hail mostly from central & north Italy and seafood dishes from Sardinia. Each dish is well executed and the portions generous. We were stuffed before the pasta and desserts were served. As for service, there were hits and misses. We were not given the wine list and had to request for one. Would have given them a rating of 5 if they have been more attentive to my reservation request. I was celebrating my birthday but yet we given a table next to the entrance. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit though expectation when it comes to service needs to be managed.

I visited some months ago, so this review is slightly delayed. But I did want to put it in, just so folks understand that each customer is important for a restaurant to be great. Let me start with we had a very good dinner. The taste was excellent, the offerings quite creative, ambience good. The food portions were ample, and given the genre, I did not feel it's too overpriced.However something also remained with me about that night ... It was late, crowds had thinned, so the proprietor mingled with us (I love when that happens!) We remarked how we loved it. At this point you expect a good host to be gracious, and that's it... But apparently someone the previous day had given him a bad review. I understand it's upsetting, but we got a lengthy diatribe on that other reviewer. It went on and on, which... you know, after a bit, wore us down! We felt our experience beginning to get marred, and also that our good review being taken for granted... :
5
First of all thank you to Chomel for describing each dish and what part of Italy inspired it.When in Singapore this is a must place. No menu don't worry let the team know and they will take wonderful care of you.All dishes were amazing and full of flavour.I wish you guys were based in London as wel
5
A wonderful meal and serving experience with every serving a delicious surprise. Come hungry because if happen not to be, as I wasn't due to a late afternoon BBQ event, you'll miss out on a course or two - or even dessert!My Wife came hungry and required a gluten free meal which was no problem for the Chef. But, even she couldn't eat all the courses - so, some take away was required. A highly recommended restaurant choice and we'll be back. Planning to go very very hungry next time
4
Is it expensive? Yes, it is but you won't regret. Everything here brings good value. The food is super nice, and we all love the truffule pasta. Love it so much. Will definitely come back soon for more yummy dishes
5
Great restaurant. The Italian cuisine is delicious, the staff is polite. It tells you what to order better! Prices are acceptable and do not bite. We ate good food and spent a good time
5
Great food, friendly staff, fun to sit back and see what the chef brings.
Decor and ambiance could be improved with tablecloths and music.
5
Just had one of the most amazing Italian dinners. Has to be one of the best Italian restaurants in Asia. The pasta and the beef cheek were sublime.
4
My first Italian omakase experience and it is wonderful. We've tried tons of difference Italian cuisine inspired by the different regions of Italy and they were all good.
3
Overly priced normal restaurant. I visited considering high rating. Was disappointed with the choice of menu and price

So this was my second omakase Italian meal over the weekend. I had gone to DOMVS Gabriel Fratini the day before and have completed a review on it. Back to Fratini la Trattoria.This is a more casual place and feels small. I had made an online reservation via Chope and had indicated my dietary preferences just like I did for DOMVS. But in this instance it did not seem like any of the service staff had paid any attention to it. Nevertheless they were very professional. They checked on what we ate and didn't as well as how well cooked the dishes should be especially the meats. We chose our own wine for the meal.We struggled to finish the meal as there were so many dishes. I might have missed a dish or two in my list below. We had a 3 dish appetizer comprising scallop, a chicken mushroom dish and salmon roll. This was followed with some lamb slices, very tender beef cheek, grilled sea bass, a truffle pasta, and a seafood pasta. The pasta choices were up to us. Make your own pasta or go with their favourites. For dessert we had a blueberry tartlet, tiramisu and Panna cotta. Again we completed the meal with a reasonably good cup of black coffee. As a bonus the service staff will tell you which part of Italy the dishes come from. Service was efficient but there is little connection with the guests. Some would prefer such service.I was pleasantly surprised when I got the bill. It was very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food
5
I don't usually give food reviews, but after dining here, I couldn't leave without sharing some good words about my fantastic experience. Unbelievable italian cuisine at an affordable price is how I would best describe this place. You can tell that everything done here is carefully thought of, from the menu to the service. If you're relying on the michelin guide for food recommendations...don't. Visit trattoria and you'll know wh

I visited Fratini La Trattoria for dinner on the 19th of August, and was very impressed with their food and service. We were seated as soon as we walked in, after which Chomel came over to our table and explained the concept and what we could look forward to. All the food was fantastic. Though I'm not a fan of seafood, I loved some of what they had to offer. Overall, I highly recommended it; it was a great meal without having to break the bank
5
We booked Fratini La Trattoria because it was recommended on TripAdvisor. It's not the type of place you will just come across, as it is well out of town. From start to finish the experience was exceptional. The service was outstanding and the young lady explained the courses in great detail. We had a 7 course degustation and all of it was delightful. The pasta with truffle, which was the 5th course served, was silky and delicious and we both agreed it was the best pasta we've ever tasted. The wines we chose with the help of the sommelier were also of the highest quality.Expensive, yes, but worth every penny for the quality that was delivered. Highly recommend a visit if you are in Singapore
4
Warm welcome and efficient servers. No menu displayed when you come in. Long list of dishes served. Diverse, hearty and quite tasty overall. Wine a bit expensive
5
Who would have thought - an Italian style omakase, right in Singapore? 10-14 dishes that changes daily, helmed by none other than the young and super bright Chef Chomel Yang. Chef Chomel took us on a culinary trip of Italy, and her unpretentious, passionate character really brought out the essence of this restaurant. Unbelievable dishes - every one of them as delicious as the last. Once you find a good Italian restaurant you should just stick to it - and this is definitely one of them
5
This is a lovely restaurant with oak tables and wooden panelling creating a cosy atmosphere. Service was efficient and friendly. Although there were 20 of us the food arrived in a good pace and was simply delicious as were the wines. Highly recommend
5
Simply far above my expectation on Italian quisine.
Kind explanation for each dish made the experience quite unique. Never had this omakase style italian before and it was definitely worth it.
Will surely visit again for the excellent truffle pasta.
4
Friendly staff, cosy setting and good dining experience with artistic decor on food presentation. Will come back again!
5
Brilliant food and their tasting menu is always superb! Lovely venue nice if you want to get out of town.
4
Food were nicely paced and superbly plated. One of the dish was over salty and was immediately rectified by the chef. Overall a good dinner
5
My wife and I were lucky enough to eat at Fratini during our July visit to Singapore. The process is a bit unique as the owner and your host visits the table and inquires about what food you cannot eat. From there your pallet is surprised by a continuous display of great food all tracing their roots back to parts of Italy.From appetizer to pasta to main to dessert the food was marvelous. In the end I think there was a total of 14 different plates that arrived at our table.The owner is warm, welcoming and truly interested in making your experience one you will remember long after your visit.If you have only one or two nights to enjoy dinner, make this one of your stops and reservation

I had been to this restaurant on a previous trip to Singapore. I had been with two colleagues at that time and loved the food, experience, ambiance, etc. Now I was back and happened to be spending my birthday alone in Singapore. I decided to return and treat myself to a special meal. It was just that - special and so enjoyable. The food is great but the service is what brought me back. Chomel and Jan took so great care of me. It was like I was with family even though I was eating alone. They even moved me from outside to inside after my first course so "they could talk to me more". Inside I was seated at a table for four and Chomel said two of the other seats were for her and Jan (ha). They even ended my meal by singing "happy birthday" to me which other people in the restaurant liked and congratulated me on my birthday. What a wonderful meal and experience! Now some details: Fratini's does not have a menu. They select dishes inspired from all over Italy and present them to you. They will adjust selections if you have food allergies, are vegetarian, etc. You will get more food than you need and the meal will take a long time (2+ hours). But with all the courses, I suggest you sit back and enjoy it. I also suggest you arrive with a good appetite.As to specific dishes, I loved the beef cheek (it was so tender). The slipper lobster was essentially a lobster imperial I could eat alone as a meal. The lamb chop (larger than I get in the US) was parmesan and herb encrusted and was fine but the accompanying sweet potato mash was to die for. The pasta was made with your choice of sauce. I chose truffles (of course) and it was fantastic. And this past dish was in addition to a meat ravioli dish. Dessert was tiramisu and creme brulee and pana cota and chocolate. (I joked that creme brulee was not Italian.) There were many more dishes but these are some of my highlights. If you like eating good, varied Italian food, are hungry, enjoy being taken care of, and have time to enjoy a meal rather than just "dine and dash", you will love Fratini's like I did

I found this restaurant by Trip Advisor. The review is very good, so we decided to try.Since the place is a little far from the center area, it took about 15mins or so by taxi.As you know, there is no menu, so we left everything to Chef's choice, but there was nothing wrong with it. From the start(appetizer) to the end(dessert), we enjoyed the food. I can mention one thing that if you are not fond of lamb, for example, you can tell so to a waiter in advance, and they will provide a different meat instead. It is 5 course menu ( including pasta ), and it was a little too much for us ( my 22 year old daughter was with me), so I brought the leftover to the hotel.Otherwise the service and the food are very satisfied, so it is worth visiting this restaurant. They call a taxi for us as well if you request

The people who rated this place "terrible" must be out of their minds! It's one of the best restaurants in Singapore, love love the concept of omakase dining, each dish is crystallized into a beautiful foodgasm (!) memory, and the atmosphere is perfect. Kudos to the chef ‍ and her team for making each visit amazing
5
One of the best dining experiences for Singaporeans and expats alike. This is truly a special place. The passion, attention to detail and service along with the food makes this a great place to eat.This is the third time that we have eaten here and each time the dishes were different to keep things interesting and very enjoyable.For a special treat and lovers of Italian food, it is difficult to go to another place in Singapore when one experiences as good a dining experience as this place.
5
My family's favourite restaurant run by charming young couple: Chomel and Jan. Everything is perfect, from the delicious food with adorable presentation to excellent services.
5
Excellent place for authentic Italian food. Special mention to the pizzas and steak. You won't be disappointed.
4
The Chef was nice and had excellent food but wine was a bit expensive. The vegetarian options were also good.
5
 14 dishes around 7 courses. i came here twice and i was so blown away by the food. they will phone you up to just check with your dietary requirements - a nice touch! the place is unassuming but the food is outstanding. It is very indulgent so Perfect for special occasions like if you are in a long term relationships or 4th Date where you want to impress but still be laidback and let the food speaks for itself
5
our third visit to Fratini, and the food is as delicious as before! Right from the first set of appetizers to the tiramisu, the meal is a great triumph in casual yet classy Italian fare. the Foie gras, scallops, truffle pasta, tiramisu were standouts(meaning to say literally everything was good)Coupled with wine and pleasing service , we had a great time here. Already planning to come back down the road 
5
I came here with a friend for a casual dinner and chat. We enjoyed the entire experience...very unique dining with no menu!! The food kept on coming and all were well prepared and presented. We choose the pasta with truffle and loved it!! We also enjoyed an nice bottle of Italian red wine and four portions of nice desserts.Highly recommended and would come back again soon!
5
2nd time here and the menu is still as great, if not better! Love that the chef experiments with unique ingredients and that really enhances the food and experience (Not a fan of eggplant but I ate it). As we were the last to leave, we got to meet the owners of the place and their adorable pet Collie. This restaurant is managed with lots of warmth, enthusiasm and food that fills the soul. Awesome and 2 thumbs up!! -Zach&Ja

No menu here, just tell them what you dislike / can't eat, then they plan accordingly.We had a 14 course dinner, most are small bite sized portions. Loved the appetizers. Some of the meats were a bit on the salty side for me. The truffle pasta was alright, but i felt it was missing something...Desserts were nice and light, not overly sweet nor heavy, very enjoyable.For your reference:Total pocket damage (inclusive of 1 bottle of still water, 1 bottle of red and 2 espressos) = SGD 350
5
Loved the no menu concept! The chef introduced the dishes himself. The food was really delicious!!!There is a fixed price for about eight courses. At the start the chef will ask you if you have any allergies, dislikes or preference. The wines that are available are also very special but it is also possible to have a normal housewine
4
I can recommend Fratini La Trattoria to all who visit Singapore for me it's one of the best Italian food in the area. If you are looking for a restaurant to vary the menu and find some truly Italian flavor,Fratini La Trattoria is the best choice,Let the chef recommend you what to eat and you will be surprised of his skills
4
food was excellent set in a country side atmosphere, away for the bustling city.would recommend to casual dining crowd
4
Great experience. Server came up to us and explain every dish. Love the fish which was succulent and fresh; Desserts was so so only though. But overall it's a good experience.
5
Best Italian restaurant in Singapore !!! The wine selection is amazing as well. Loved everything about it
5
Food was excellent. Went there to celebrate Father's Day and was stuffed to the max! Thank you Fratini!
4
We like the fact that there is no menu and we can be surprised at every dish that is served. Staff are all super friendly and welcoming. Will make repeated visits.
4
Food was superb! We had lunch and finished every morsel. Great service too. On the downside you hear the same menu being repeated to the next table as the restaurant is rather small but cosy
5
We dined @ Fratini La Trattoria last night and found that the restaurant lived up to the favourable reviews it has been receiving of late. There’s no menu - Rather they simply make what they want taking into consideration dietary requirements.There were a range of courses which we found all to be excellent however our favourite was the pasta. The only “hick-up” was we found the beef cheeks to be somewhat on the cold side when served - The owner, Chomel, quickly addressed this however by providing another serving without request.Wine list was adequate for the food being served and we found the service to be good.Chomel @ only 26 is doing an amazing job running the show with her partner - It’s great to see such enthusiasm and hard work which I’m more than happy to support by planning to dine there again with a group of friends next time
5
Rarely do you find a restaurant in Singapore who takes so much pride in its food and service. I have eaten at Fratini a few times and the experience has always been delightful. I love the dining concept - you get to sample a variety of dishes, with just the right portion to fill you up before moving on to the next course. The food is exquisite and lovingly prepared, and the service is simply impeccable. Definitely looking forward to my next visit
5
Super delicious ITALIAN food OMAKASE style! Awesome service by Chomel & her team! Great variety to fill your tummies! Create a profile & aim to try different food every visit! It's a joyful suspense not knowing what you'll eat next! 2 thumbs up
5
Being Italian, I can honestly say that this is the best Italian food I had in Singapore BY FAR. In particular, this is Italian food cooked respecting the traditional ways but revisited in terms of presentation and sequence of the plates. The result is a fantastic combination of foods and tastes - you definitely have to try by yourself! Additionally, the young and talented owner is incredibly knowledgeable about Italy and Italian food and has a very welcoming yet detail-oriented attitude.Excellent food, fantastic service and great owner - what are you waiting for?!?! Go!!
5
unfortunately booked for a private function
owner could not have been more understanding
will definitely return
5
Good place for wonderful evening night out, be it with friends or love one!
Will definitely go again!
4
We were not quite sure what to expect at first, as restaurant was unassuming and small. We were pleasantly surprised, food was excellent! Price particularly good considering quality and volume of courses! We'll be back!
5
This restaurant has been on my wish to go list for so long. I've heard that this place provides no menu, just sit back and enjoy whatever comes on the table. How lovely concept?!Especially, it is perfect for a person like me who is indecisive :p (mostly I take so long to chose what to eat when I go to a new restaurant haha) Most of main ingredients come from South Italy and they are very fresh. And can u believe that they change their menu everyday? The more bigger surprise is if you leave ur number and name in their system, they track your record to make sure you wont get the same dish at ur next visit!! :D Well, we believe it was an excellent choice! We enjoyed every single dish on my table. I feel sorry that I am not a good food critic who can describe the beauty of the dish but just saying I really liked it. Cozy atmosphere, very friendly staffs, tables are distant enough so it could give u privacy... I will def come back again!! :D Two thumbs up!
4
The concept of this restaurant is that there is no menu and the chef just serves what is the specials for the day. There are 10-14 dishes and if you think the portions are thus smaller, think again. Each portion is sizable which is great but also makes you full very fast especially for a small eater. I enjoyed the appetizers (esp the scallop) and desserts. The pasta was great but a tad salty. The lamb was however overcooked but the beef cheeks were great. Also liked the slipper lobster. Service was good. Overall a good exp and value for money but not sure if I will be back any time soon.
5
I had a meal with my mum and missus. What a wonderful experience! There is no menu so you let the chef decide what to feed you. Every dish was beautifully executed. There was salmon, scallop and octopus for starter, there was tasty soup, seared snapper, baked crayfish, stewed beef cheek, lamb kebabs, and more. At least 12 items. Did i mention dessert - pistachio panacotta, creme brulee, and lip smacking tiramisu! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there. Service was also excellent. For the food standard, the servings, the service. It is very good value
5
Brilliant execution on the no menu concept. I had the meat version, the wife did not and we both came away full, happy and having fully enjoyed a fairly decadent culinary experience. Wine list was great, service was perfect and the cost was very fair given the produce used. The wine bill quickly adds up but that's island wide not restaurant specific. Well worth the trip
5
Checked out this little place in Greenwood Avenue with my friends, and boy, was I impressed. I was initially skeptical about the concept - no menu! - but my concerns were clearly unfounded. Every dish impressed and delighted, from the appetisers to the pasta (truffle pasta was great!) and the dessert. I spent $50/pax (I think that's the price for lunch) and I thought it was decent value.Definitely coming back with my fiancée
4
My wife and I came here for our wedding anniversary dinner. We had high expectations based on Fratini's ratings on TA. The wine list was outstanding. Really wonderful selection. Importantly, a lot of unique options. I counted three different Cannonau bottles. Some other favorites like Aglianico. Pleasant and warm atmosphere inside. There is no menu. Instead it's like a tasting menu. The chef's imagination pretty much guides the way. Some of the dishes were excellent. Some were just ok. Variability is probably to be expected - but again given the exceptionally high ratings this was a bit disappointing. These probably won't be available again for whoever reading this - but the baked scallops with scamorza, the lamb, and the creme brûlée all stood out. The pasta (our one choice - we choose the beef) was underwhelming, although the chef did nail the al dente. The service was ok. A jug of water was unceremoniously left on the table. We eventually figured out that we were supposed to pour it ourselves. Our sommelier was extremely gregarious - a bit too much. E.g. After we ordered a bottle of cannonau, he kept asking about whether we thought it was great (we did) and then telling us "I told you so". Thanks. We sat in the back section - alone. I felt like we were forgotten at times. Had to get up to get their attention twice.
5
We were recommended to try out this restaurant and we were not disappointed! The omakase menu was very appetizing and well explained by the head chef. She came by our table and made us feel welcome, definitely a big part of creating a warm and cozy atmosphere. As said, go for the food as it changes every time, depending on the chef. Excellent eats and service. Will definitely be back
4
Servers were attentive and polite. Great knowledge on food being served. Everything was very fresh except for the truffle pasta which tasted bland.
5
Fantastic food great and attentive service in a relaxed environment-- not cheap but worth it. Will be back
5
A fantastic birthday dinner. The food was superb and the service excellent. From meltingly tender beef cheeks to perfectly pan-fried sea bass.....it was all delicious. Highly recommended!
5
This is a amazing food trip in Singapore, where you can expect for unexpecting food coming, and excellent cuisine there
5
Great lunchâ€”think it was $50/pax and the chef just brings you a selection of things. Considering how delicately it was made and how well the flavors bounced off each other, I think $50 was a steal. Would definitely want to go back to try out dinner...when I have the $$
5
Fantastic food, staff really friendly and attentive. Quality of food is really good. Chomel and team are really attentive, we are regular, our servings have been recorded, we hardly have repeats. Good variety. Great ambient. For couples dating, family gathering. We alway enjoy our time there
4
The restaurant is ran by a young couple, they are not italians but they could as they cook italian very well! Food quality is very high, mix of tastes, suprise you a little bit ! Don't expect to have a main plate, it is more "tapas" that you will share.Truffle pastas are amazing, mmm just taking about it give me the envy to go back 
5
One of the best tasting menus ever. The quality and range of food, the presentation and the service were all impeccable. Chomel, the young chef and owner, is an incredibly talented person and we enjoyed getting to know her. Highly recommend - a treat for the palate and an unforgettable experience
5
We enjoyed celebrating our 18th anniversary here recently. The food was delicious. It was great fun not knowing what we would be eating and letting the chef "do her thing". She's well qualified! Service was excellent, and we were able to enjoy a leisurely dinner without being rushed. We plan to go back again soon
5
This place was such a great find. Nestled away in Bukit Timah. We travelled from East coast and was totally worth it! Such good quality and quantity for the price you pay. Each dish was as good as the next and super fresh. If we had to chose the scallops and the lamb chops were the top standout dishes. The young owners were both excellent hosts, friendly and informative. They explained each dish as it arrived and the region it came from. We loved this restaurant so much we have booked it again this week as we have visitors in town. Such a great and different experience. Well worth the money for what you get.
4
The best dinner. Will be back for more. Enjoyed the courses and loved the lobster the most.
Ended with a marvellous dessert spread.....Chocolate salami. YUM
5
Great place! Highly recommended. My first time there with some friends and I can say it was super. Well done Chomel and team. I'll be back with more friends and family soon!!
5
Exclusive and customized! Really great quality of served food. And awesome experience and differentiation from restaurants in Singapore
5
Amazing restaurant, with perfect restaurant. And wonderful atmosphere. A offer everyone this restaurant.
4
It was a very good experience,their stuffs were very polite and the food was marvelous too. We will hope to go back soon
5
Had many omakase meals before but italian omakase is a first for me. Chomel was very detailed when explaining the dishes. all the dishes were executed well. will definitely be back again with my family !
5
My husband brought me here on a surprise date and I was blown away by the food and the experience - it feels more like a private dining experience, there's no menu and the really friendly chef (and staff) will personally check what you prefer or don't and you can sit back and enjoy a 2-3 hour extended (7-8 course - can't recall exactly!) dinner because they don't turn tables. The ingredients and the preparations tasted extremely delicious and high quality and all dishes were customized for vegetarians. They serve good wine too. It's expensive for sure but worth it for special occasions. May need to reserve well in advance to get a table since the space is small and limited
5
Our family visited for lunch on a Tuesday, and we were glad we had reservations! This chef-owned restaurant isn't very large, but it's worth the wait! The head chef came to our table several times to help us chose a family-style menu and accommodated the no-shellfish requirement of my sister-in-law while allowing the rest of us to enjoy shrimp. A little pricy, but well worth the entertainment and delicious appetizers, mains, and desserts. My parents live in Singapore, and this was their third visit
5
Was here on a surprise date. No idea where it was but my heart was beating with excitement as soon as they sat us down. They have a surprise menu, molecular dining. Each course is better than the other. The service is wonderful and the food is phenomenal
4
 We visited for lunch on a Sunday.Food The food lived up to my expectations, and I especially loved the appetizers and dessert. Main course was a tad short, portion a bit big.ServiceOur waitress served and explained the dishes well, even though she did seem a bit unwilling.Overall, I loved the experience and would definitely visit again for dinner
5
That was really a good surprise to find an original Italian food in Asia.The atmosphere is always great and have yet to find better Italian food anywhere in the city.
5
If you're fond of Itallian cuisine, this is the place to be. I was surprised by the delicious courses and wonderful service. Will be back again with more customers for you!
Keep it up!!
5
My first time to dine in this restaurant, the food are really good, I like the cappuccino soup, and will return for it.
5
Came for dinner...went home with an absolutely new experience in Italian fine dining! Got a well surprise menu. Thanks to u!!
5
We had a great experience here with lovely food and great service. Particularly like the concept with no menu, but yet the possibility to adjust in case certain things on the menu that day isn't preferred
5
We've been in Singapore 18 months now and can't believe we just now found Fratini La Trattoria. I hesitate to post only because it's a small restaurant and very quaint ... had hoped to keep it a secret. I see how ever that the word is out on Trip Advisor so now I know why reservations were required. My husband and I enjoyed a 10+ dish dinner on Friday night. The food was amazing ... and we tried dishes that we probably wouldn't order on our own. As mentioned, there is no "menu" however the chef's will adapt to your preferences (eg. Vegetarian and ask if you enjoy lamb, beef, raw fish, etc.). We had no restrictions and I'm glad because we had the opportunity to experience the Chef's choices with ingredients from across Italy.The price was reasonable SG90++ given the variety of dishes that you experience ... and it is an EXPERIENCE! Not something we would do everyday but certainly for special occasions or visiting family this will now be on our "must do" list.Thanks to everyone at Fratini for making our date night memorable! ~Diane & PeterPS - we had a seat outside on the walkway. It added to the ambience and temperature was pleasant. I asked my husband to wear long pants given the "upscale" restaurant however SHORTS would be recommended. Hope that helps
4
my first time to dine this Restaurant ..food was Really good ..flavour was perfect .I like the cappuccino soup...will definitely Return Back to this plac
5
If you are someone who appreciates fine food, you'll love this place. A true celebration of exquisite Italian cuisine, prepared by a chef who is passionate about serving and​ delighting​ her guests. This is not a cheap place, nor somewhere to go if you're in a hurry. We went as a celebration for our last night in Singapore and loved it. Many thanks.

The service was excellent throughout. The food was very good; some dishes were better than others. The pasta at the end was great. The rest of the courses were all well made, but none of them were memorable. The amount of food provided over the entire dinner was not enough for me. I left wanting for more. But in the end, the 90SGD menu ended up to a total of 180SGD after adding tax, the standard pre-calculated tip, and 2 (mid-range price) glasses of wine. 180SGD is 100GBP or 120USD, for one person. Even though the service was excellent and the food was all around prepared nicely, I can't really justify paying that amount for a dinner that wasn't memorable and didn't even really fill me up. The same amount will buy you dinner at many restaurants that will provide a memorable experience wherever you are in the world (including Singapore itself)
5
What a fantastic restaurant. Food was magnificent. Service was equally so. One of the owners also explained every dish and the Italian origins of the dish.So good we booked the restaurant for a large group as a treat for an upcoming trade show.I believe it is one of the best restaurants in Singapore.Absolutely fabulous
5
It was a great experience in Singapore. The staff was excellent and the surprise we had after each dish was unforgettable. Come hungry!
4
I had a great time dining at this restaurant. My family loved this place. My buddies liked this restaurant a lot.
5
In many ways just repeating what others have said. This is an outstanding restaurant. From the initial booking - which was followed by a whatsapp message asking if we had any special requests - through to the table outside, the quality of the food, the presentation and explanations and the overall service standards. It really was impossible to fault. One of our party was a vegetarian - no problem at all. There is no menu - just go with the flow. You will not be disappointed. Highly recommended
5
I had dinner here last Friday night, based on the Trip Advisor #2 ranking, and found the ranking was off - I can't believe there's a better restaurant in Singapore than Fratini La Trattoria. I had one of the best meals ever, anywhere, and I think that's saying a lot for a New Yorker who's spent multiple times in Paris, London, Rome, Florence and Tel Aviv. The service was outstanding. Cholen, an owner, was my chef and lead server. The first thing that struck me was her enthusiasm, her passion for her restaurant and the meal she'd be preparing for me. There's no menu - Cholen discussed with me what I was allergic to, or wouldn't want, and she went to work. The meal led off with tastes of 4 appetizers - salmon squid ink with cream cheese, scallops with sundried tomato & mozarella, filo pastry with pork & artichokes, and chicken roulade with bolognaise. Each was outstanding. My next course was the beef cheek with veal jus, absolutely wonderful. The meat was so tender that it literally melted away in my mouth, and I ate the course slowly because I wanted the taste to last. Next up was red snapper with lemon, thyme & mustard - I thought nothing would come close to the beef, but the snapper lived up to the high standards that had been set. Next was the slipper lobster with garlic and tarragon, and the main courses concluded with lamb rack with grape sauce. Each course was as visually striking as it was delicious. I felt like Cholen's love for her craft was cooked into each dish. For dessert, I had tastings of crÃ¨me brulee, a honey panna cotta, a chocolate nougat cookie and tiramisu, each one, outstanding. Even the coffee was wonderful. Since Friday night, I've told everyone I work with about the restaurant and what a wonderful, satisfying meal I had. The restaurant is on the expensive side, but, when you consider the quality of the meal, I thought it was an incredible bargain, to be taken care of so well and completely. It was an honor to receive this dinner. I was upset to learn that the restaurant will be closed for renovations when I'm next in Singapore, the end of April. But it will be a mandatory meal on all subsequent trips. And I felt so special when Cholen told me I was now in the restaurant's data base, where they would keep track of the meals they served me so as to not repeat a course, unless, of course, I ask for a repeat. This is everything I could ask for in a restaurant. The best it has to offer, prepared and served with impeccable grace and style. Cholen was aided by a wonderful staff, each of whom seemed essential to the overall product. Absolutely outstanding
5
Loved everything. The place the food the ambience and really friendly staff and Chef.Meals were served so elegantly and each dish was better than the previous one. I could barely finish the whole 14 course but it was so good that I just had to try a bit of everything regardless of how full I was.Can't wait to go back there again
5
There's no menu; currently (March 2017) the cost of the meal is 90SGD per person, but for that you get an incredible variety of food. My wife and I had 13 different dishes, and the vegetarian offerings for my wife were just as interesting and appealing as my meat options. Will do again, next time we're in Singapore
5
Have you ever been spoiled for choice when ordering at a restaurant that you just KNOW is going to have great food? Fret not cause at Fratini, they do away with the menus entirely. Sit down and let the staff, chefs and kitchen crew (who are friendly, excitable and very accommodating) take the best care of you.Depending on when you go, you can savor up to 10-ish different dishes from all over Italy. With each course, you'll get a little story about the geographic influences and inspiration of what you're gonna eat.Do reserve in advance!**SPOILER ALERT** Stop Reading if you, like me, want to be pleasantly surprised by what's on the menu (which does change constantly, I think).Tuck into favorites such as a starter platter of chicken roulade and burrata scallops (amongst others), warm appetizers such as slipper lobster with a creamy tarragon sauce (MY GOD) and melt in your mouth beef cheek, a pasta main served direct from the pan and several delicious desserts to round off the night. I know I am liberally peppering my review with many adjectives, but it's all true. I had no complaints and enjoyed the whole experience. Pro tip: EAT LIGHT FOR LUNCH.The staff will check with you before hand about any dietary requirements you might have and make the necessary arrangements. I don't take squid, and they were happy to oblige.Location wise, the Bukit Timah area is a bit 'ulu' (isolated) but a walk down will bring you to a bunch of bars and stuff if you still want to have an after dinner tipple. Price: Reasonable for the dining experience and ambiance. Did I mention that slipper lobster was amazing?Will bring people I want to impress here (like my boss, who hopefully is not reading this
5
Crazy expensive, but a lovely experience for a romantic meal with your special someone. The menu is creative and the service is top-notch
5
Chomel and her team always amaze! No menu, but the small dishes keep coming--each one more spectacular than the last: beef pepper bolognaise, scallops parmesan garlic, salmon lemon dill caviar, parma ham with truffle risotto, beef cheek, lamb rack lavender crust, lobster garlic thyme, and seabass with artichoke and sundried tomatoes. Cannot wait for my next visit
5
Tucked away in the suburbs of Bt Timah is this gem where you will be filled with scrumptious Italian food. The young owner,Chloe, really knows her food. If you are out of ideas and wish to have good food & service, Fratini is the place to go
5
This is an omakase-type experience, with Italian food. No menus, no prices, just asked us for dietary restrictions and the kitchen starts pumping things out.
From start to finish, outstanding meal. Service is friendly, food was impeccably prepared and presented.
5
4th visit and still great fun and brilliant food! Staff are wonderful and always explain all about each dish. The variety of dishes is amazing and all to such high standard! LOVE IT!!
4
Had a great time here , menu was hard to understand at first but the management came to our rescue !!
5
Visited recently based on previous trip advisor reviews and was not disappointed. Food was excellent, as was the service - there is also a huge wine menu - although they didn't seem to pair these with the dishes which seemed a bit of a waste given the wide range available.Will defiantly be back
5
We followed a friend's recommendation to have dinner here whilst in Singapore and went with the nine course taster dinner. The young woman that discussed our dietary needs and preferences with us turned out to be our cook for at least the main course. For this dinner there is no menu, you just tell them what you like and don't like, what you're allergic to or are unable to eat and then they bring you course after course of regional specialities from all over Italy. For those concerned about quantities and over-eating... don't be; this is a series of small plates, and only one pasta (for which you choose type of pasta, sauce and kind of meat/fish before they make it to order no matter how off the wall your combination is...beef arrabbiata with fettuccine, anyone?).There's an extensive wine list and I was pleasantly surprised that my favourite special treat red from Campania (EUR 100 a bottle in a similar calibre restaurant in Italy) was "only" SGD 170 here, so a relatively modest extra mark-up).This is a small and very popular restaurant, so make sure you book ahead by a minimum of two weeks. Service is very friendly and efficient and we had absolutely nothing to grumble about. One of the best dinners of my life
5
My in laws were visiting Asia so we decided to have the best departure dinner possible before they left. With great memories of a dinner 11 months earlier I made reservations. When we arrived I didn't see the gregarious Italian Chef from our previous visit and I became a bit concerned. I did recognize the informative and attractive young lady who greeted us and explained the menu to our party. She had been the master behind the glorious deserts from our prior trip. Homeless Yang had attained head Chef status and she deserves the title! The dinner was glorious!!! We were served 14 completely different items including 4 deserts, a choice of main pastas and 9 "appetizers" and these were items many high quality restaurants would charge dearly for as mains. She offered scallops, lamb, prawns, beef cheek, salmon, and small lobster tail! Every item was professionally prepared and presented. Dinner pacing was relaxed but not slow as they brought dishes over with a full explanation. The meal is not cheap at 99S$ per person but it was truly the best value for the quality of any meal I have enjoyed in Singapore. She could easily raise the cost significantly and still have a fantastic quality level. Relatively small restaurant with both inside and outside dining an a very good wine selection. The trattoria will be on the top of my list for very special occasions! Congratulations Chef

Cozy spot away from the city. To start, we asked for a chair to put our bags out was told to put our bags on the wine shelf counter top which was very dirty (dust and ants). Food came fast, appetizers were good. For entrees, the pork was very tender. However, fish (grouper) was not very fresh. The truffle pasta was a big let down as it was too plain, and we expected more. Overall, food was OK, but the major problem was that it was way too salty (maybe to mask the not so fresh seafood). Total bill came out to be $329 for 3 people, no alcohol ordered, only 2 pots of tea as drinks, which was quite a value for money for 14 courses. Service was good
5
Initially we were unsure with the concept of dining without a menu but we were pleasantly surprised at every dish. Chomel gave great introductions of each of the dishes which made the experience all the more pleasant and we looked forward to the next dish at every point of the lunch. Flavours were great as well and portion size were good. Really enjoyed the al dente seafood squik ink pasta! We look forward to our next visit
5
Singapore is known for their food and Fratini raised the bar. There is no menu, they serve what is fresh and creatively prepared. Come with an appetite as you get at least eight tasting platters, one more delicious than the next. Each item comes from a particular region of Italy which made the meal experience even more interesting as the origin of each item was explained in depth by the wait staff who are all either chefs or serious foodies and take pleasure in describing each item. The scallops on the appetizer platter were insane as were the lobster tails and the pasta - and you get to choose the sauce! The wine selections were all top Italian. And just when you thought you could't eat a single morsel more, the dessert platter is presented with panache. Fratini is already on the list and tongues of Singapore's foodies. Get there soon

Delicious surprise for lunch. Loved the idea of no menu. Six appetisers- 3 cold and 3 hot, 2 pastas and a perfect dessert trio to end it all off with wonderful cappuccinos. A definite must try for any foodie that finds themselves in the area. Perfect portions that don't leave you feeling overly fed. Loved the halibut and awesome panna cotta
5
Great taste with great presentation! The place is suitable for business dinner and family. Will definitely come back again.
5
This place is really especial. From the starters to the desserts you fell like eating in a Friend's house. There is no menu and the Chef does a very special sequencing. The pasta, the meat, the sauces and everything else is well selected making a perfect combination. Great Italian wine list makes it even better. My wife and I enjoyed a afternoon in our holiday in Singapore. I would come back again if I had time but sure I will when I visit Singapore again

We booked this restaurant before Christmas having seen such positive reviews on TripAdvisor and it lived up to all our expectations. We received a message from the restaurant during the afternoon to confirm our booking for that evening which we appreciated.The quality and variety of the food was outstanding and whilst not cheap, we considered it to be good value. Highlights were the truffle pasts and tiramisu - which my wife is not normally a fan of but this was so good!The staff were all without exception so very friendly and helpful
4
There's no menu as it's an Italian "omakase" dining concept, and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of ingredients and the unique food choices. Jan did a great job of explaining the origins of the dishes, down to the specific regions of Italy which the dishes hail from, and how the restaurant regularly changes the food offerings up to keep things interesting. Well done, we'll be back for more soon!
5
The food had a good mix of beef, fish, slipper lobster and ending with a pasta of choice. The portion was just nice, not too much. Each item arrived warm and ready to eat! I can see that the chef really had put much thought in the preparation.The staffs were friendly and attentive. The place was not too noisy even when crowds streamed in after 7.Overall it was a great dining experience! The only problem was finding a parking lot
5
If you are looking for a fantastic Italian restaurant in Singapore, look no further. This was our third visit and it never disappoints. The menu is always delicious and varied and they are very accommodating of special dietary requirements. Excellent food, excellent service, knowledgeable staff and lovely atmosphere. Highly recommend
4
Wife and I had a lovely evening last night at Fratini. The restaurant itself looks a bit confused inside, but very cosy. The waitress was energetic, very attentive and described each meal as they arrive (necessary given the Omakase structure I.e . No menu). The food was really good, not great but we left content if not needing a very light breakfast this morning. Highlights were the scallops, truffle pasta, slipper lobster and desert trio. Good value for money. Would recommend
4
After reading so many great reviews, we finally managed to snag a reservation and really looked forward to what should have been a great evening. I can confirm food was very good- great flavors, unusual combinations. However, the service was not good. It took too long between courses so by the time we got to the pasta, we lost interest and felt disappointed. No accommodation offered either even though we told them it was taking too long.
5
This restaurant doesn't have a menu so they start by asking about the food that you can and cannot eat or if you have allergies. My husband is a vegetarian and they were able to make a tasting menu for him. I can pretty much eat anything so they gave me a variety of seafood and meat that was very delicious!! The meal started with 4 small appetizers then they brought me a lobster, sea bass, beef cheek and lamb chop. After the small plates, they made us choose a pasta to share or if we wanted a different one each. We decided to share the truffle mushroom pasta and it was amazing. Dinner ended with 4 desserts that were all good too. The bill ended up to be 350+sgd but not so bad considering we had 2 glasses of prosecco and a bottle of wine!! Our sever was really helpful and very attentive too. Great place and I'd love to come back again for another special occasion

My fiancee and I went on 19 February 2017 for dinner. It was a surprise dinner from me to her for our anniversary, as she was overseas for the actual day.First Impressions:The restaurant was beside Rubato's and almost seemed overshadowed by the more ostentatious neighbour. Walk in though and the interior gives off a more casual, comfortable vibe to it.We were greeted at the door by a waiter and shown to our seats quickly. Chomel, the proprietor, came over and gave us a brief rundown on what to expect for our meal there.Meal Impressions:Combination platter of 4 starters - Of the 4, both of us loved the scallops the most, as it was cooked to perfection and not the non-lethal leather buckshot that overcooked scallops tend to become. The glutinous rice starter was disappointing though as it kinda rough on the palate and hard to identify what taste it was trying to promote.Stewed Beef Cheek - This dish was outstandingly done. The beef cheek was cooked to melt-in-your-mouth goodness.Cheese-baked Slipper Lobster- Another great dish. The slipper lobster was done right and was really easy to dig out of the shell.Lamb Rack - Very nice indeed, the lamb was tender and cooked well. 1 of the better lamb racks I have eaten yet. Could use a bit of a tenderising though.Fish (I can't remember what kind) - The fish was a wee bit overcooked. It was still fine though.Main Pasta (Truffle Pasta) - This... honestly was kinda a big disappointment to the both of us. We were expecting this to be good (yknw... being a Italian joint and all) and the previous courses were mostly outstanding. However, the sauce struggled to shine and make its mark. It just didn't excite the palate and have that umami feel that a good plate of pasta gives you. The pasta itself was cooked right though, with an almost perfect al dente consistency.Desserts Platter - This salvaged our disappointment in the truffle pasta. The desserts were very nice, though my fiancee didn't really like the chocolate biscuit (forgot what the item's name was... sorry)Overall Impressions:I think that this place offers great value for the food it brings out to you. Though we were disappointed by the pasta, the supposedly star of the meal, it still doesn't detract from the fact that at 90+ bucks, this was a very very good meal. Here's hoping that Chomel and crew can figure out what is lacking in their truffle pasta and give it the oomph it needs to shine among all the other stellar entries in the lineup.P.S. Special shoutout to the male service staff that served us our wine (forgot his name... my memory is failing me). His easy-going nature, funny quips and his knack for appearing just at the right time to attend to a need not spoken (me needing another glass of wine mid dinner and appearing to offer tea just as I was thinking of having some) was a stellar example of service done right. It made our evening so much more enjoyable. Well Done, Sir
5
Everything was very well done from start to finish. The courses were presented at a good pace and the food was delicious and flowed well. Each dish was described well as well as its origin in different regions of Italy.
5
Good food, good service and good ambience. They don't have menu, the chef serves his choice of dishes. Good choice of vegetarian food.
5
Love the suspense of the unknown menu for dinner my wife and I had here! Enjoyed the introduction of every food we had and the delight of the freshness of the ingredients. Thankful for the surprise desert to celebrate our wedding anniversary:)
5
Found this restaurant via TripAdvisor. Went to try out this no menu Italian restaurant. What's good about this place ? Appetisers, Pasta and Desserts all really nice. Don't be fool by the rating as expensive. Set Lunch is only S$45. I love new food pair with wines. The Chef is very considerate. Don't think you have been to any place which will serve your pasta in a heavy bottom pan. A really good idea. This helps to maintain your pasta warm. Would definitely go back to this place again. Just to share some of the pictures here.

After reading the TA reviews, me and my wife decided to give FLT a try for their valentine dinner with very high expectation but was disappointed. Good and not so good:(+) Good friendly service. (+) No fixed menu and offered a variety of dishes.(+) The pigeon was tasty.(-) Probably it is the valentine day dinner and the business volume, some dishes were not really fresh. (the prawn with the soup and the lobster dish). (-) The pasta (2 types) were both disappointing with presentation and the taste. The sea-urchin source pasta tasted fishy and my wife and I took only one bite...Overall happy with the service but disappointed with the food quality
5
Amazing food, had a 10 course meal that started with salmon cooked in 3 different style and ended with 4 different things for dessert. All gave me a very unique gastronomic experience, including that sea urchin pasta, which tastes very.. unique. Good selection of wine, lovely staffs, nice small place...totally worth the price! There's no menu here, but you definitely no need to worry about that as they cater all your needs; no pork, vegan, gluten-free,you name it! Better book in advance, especially if you plan to visit on weekend
4
Had a birthday dinner with family. The staff was friendly and service was very personalised. The restaurant took care of the food, save me the hassle of scrutinising the menu. Excellent service and the ambient was good. The excitement of not knowing what will be served next add element of surprises throughout the dinner. Had a great time
5
This restaurant is tucked away neatly in a quiet neighbourhood.This place serves Italian cuisine.Mainly set courses.We ordered a 10 course set for lunch.Atmosphere was very relaxed and not many around.Service was efficient.Food was amazing.The captain would explain every dish while placing it.It would cost SGD 65 per person.It is advised to reserve your table in advance.Restaurant a must visit
5
This spot was selected by our daughter for her 17th birthday dinner tonight. Not knowing what to expect, and with two choosy diners, we embarked on a tasting menu from seemingly all parts of Italy. The verdict: absolutely fantastic. From the apps to the pasta we kept finding new ways to describe our gastro delights. The wine selection was ample and affordable (for Singapore) and the staff were attentive, courteous and knowledgable on both food and drink. Our only negative was that we had to cut short our evening to catch a flight after Birthday cake at home. We shall return.

Went to FLT this week for our 14th wedding anniversary - enjoyed I made a booking a few days prior, was contacted by FLT mid afternoon on the day to confirm which was good Degustation ~ 7 courses all very enjoyable and well presented - lamb was v good Wine list all ItalianRecommend as a step up from other similar restaurants in Singapore, reasonably priced at $90 pp +
5
We did New Years Ewe here.
Unfortunately they had two sittings and we were on the first one so we had to leave early.
The food is brilliant. Quite creative without being stupid.
Surprisingly big selection of Italian wines.
AN enjoyable evening
5
Had a really lovely meal at this restaurant. You do not choose from a menu. You advise the chef what you do and do not eat. The chef then puts a menu together for you. Absolutely wonderful.
5
Nice Italian atmosphere, surprisingly for Singapore. But the kitchen really Mediterranean. Many dishes familiar to Italian restaurants. Good pasta, tolyatini, delicious salads and dessert- all that is here. And good wine, and meat, and fish. The waiters are friendly and agile. Very pleased!
4
A top restaurant with high quality food and excellent staff. It is always a joy when you waitress knows the food she serves, are able to recommend suitable wines and does it all with a smile.
I will definitely be back...one of my Singapore favorites.
5
We loved the food here and the service is great! We wanted vegetarian and it's hard to find restaurant that serves a variety of vegetarian food in a set menu! Very nice! Okay wine selection as well. Coming back again
5
Restaurant situated out of the way, but don't let this put you off at all. This is well worth the journey (10 mins in a cab from downtown area). There is no menu, instead the chef creates something based on dietary requirements. Had around 5 courses in total. Everything was explained as it arrived, and everything was amazing. Highlight was having a personal pasta made just for us. Service great too, cannot fault this restaurant at all. Cost was around $120 for food alone per person, wine was $70 per bottle.
4
Not a fine dining place but staffs are approachable. Some dishes are ok some are not. Singapore have too much to offer, it will be a while before I repeat my visit.
5
Every once and a while you book a restaurant based on the reviews and come out happy to write your own adding to the general positive trend. This is the kind of restaurant you would probably walk by without noticing if you hadn't been looking for it. But it's looks are deceptive, the simple basic decor is matched by simple but top quality ingredients and laid back but professional service. Everything was good and some of it great, ambience was a plus, it is now our go to restaurant in Singapore
5
This is an extremely good restaurant. No menus, they just prepare what is freshest and best on the day. The scallops were particularly good. They have an excellent list of Italian wines, although listed alphabetically by vineyard rather than region or style. Makes interesting reading as all sorts of things pop out at you. I recommend the Primotivo from Puglia. If you can’t be bothered, or aren’t too sure about the various types and regions, their sommelier can be relied on, and is extremely knowledgeable. It was interesting that his recommendation was one of the cheapest bottles on the list. On that note, the wine prices are very reasonable, especially for Singapore. Looking forward to dining there again, on our next visit to Singapore. 5 stars (although six wouldn’t be unreasonable

We were going to celebrate my wife’s birthday and chose Fratini, which was recommended by family and highly rated in ‘tripadviser’. We were utterly delighted with the choice. We've been to many restaurants and eateries over the years but only two where there was ‘no menu’, Fratini being one; the Chef decides on what to serve after taking into consideration any dietary requirements. As we had none, the saying goes “the sky’s the limit”. Before or as each dish was served, it was ‘deliciously’ explained to us (by the Chef, herself). The portions are not large but trust me, your taste buds will be tickled to the maximum and you will feel full at the end! Considering the quality and what we got, I would go so far as to say pricing is on the low end of the high, hope you know what I mean but well worth every penny!Some advice, we booked ahead and our recommendation is for you do the same, especially if it’s a weekend! And suggest you get an early slot as it takes a bit of time to go through a 10 course including wine, dessert and coffee/tea. The intervals between the courses were just slightly long because of the crowd but it was well worth the wait when the food was served! In short, Fratini serves high quality food with an excellent level of service accompanied by a wonderful and entertaining Chef and has an ideal ambiance for a relaxing meal (and time). Best we have ever been, for sure
5
This was our second visit in 2 months, this time to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Chomel's team did a fantastic job... many new dishes since our last visit, attentive service and of course excellent food! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fine dinning experience.
2
The food really lacked seasoning. I don't mind paying decent price for decent food but disappointed when the food is bland, regardless of the price. I was expecting a taste explosion but felt the lacked basic seasoning, I couldn't get past tha
5
A group of 5 of us had dinner here tonight and it was completely amazing. The service was fantastic, and started before we even arrived at the restaurant with Chomel messaging me to let me know I could message her if I needed to make a change to the booking, and to let her know if there were any special dietary requirements.As for the food, we had a number of amazing courses. Some of the dishes stood out more than others, but all of them were delicious and I would be excited to have any of them for a main. Having said that, the truffle pasta was especially amazing and we all commented on how well prepared the pasta was and how amazing it tasted.This is definitely one of the better restaurants I have ever visited, and I look forward to returning.Cost for the evening was $825SG for 5 people, which included 2 bottles of wine and some coffees at the end of our mea
5
It was a friend's recommendation that that we went to this little restaurant that takes a great deal of pride in the quality of the food. Each course was presented and explained in depth and clearly the Chef has a good understanding of Italian food. She takes pains to ensure that all guests have a great time. Good wine selection too! Thoroughly enjoyable experience.
5
I decided to pick this highly-rated Italian restaurant for my husband's birthday treat as I found the concept of tapas-styled meals without a menu something different. We were served a 5 course meal, including pasta and dessert which was very well presented and explained in detail. They even created an all-vegetarian menu for me. Loved the food, will highly recommend
5
We were here to celebrate our Anniversary and so glad we chose this place. Not many restaurants can brag of excellent service in Singapore but Fratini sure can!It's amazing how they alter the dishes to suit our preferences and are mindful of the ingredients that we don't like. Was definitely worth every penny and in fact, felt that we got a lot more for what we paid cause of the overall experience. Do listen to the in-house sommelier for wine recommendations - you won't be disappointed.Highly recommended for date nights/special occasions
5
Extraordinary dining experience with the freshest ingredients and flavorful dishes which surprises at every turn. This is the best of 'Omakase', 'Fine Dining' but in generous portions, topped with full 'Michelin star' service and infused with Italian hospitality.Very unique and enjoyable for special occassions. Look for the talented and friendly Chef Yang who hosted our table
5
Had a wedding anniversary dinner at this delightful restaurant serving omakase style, set dinner, featuring cuisines of meats, seafood and veg from various parts of Italy. It was a gastronomic experience. There is a wide selection of wines, service is great where the waiters are attentive, jovial and friendly, explaining each dish European style. They are very careful and concerned about allergies as well. Dishes can be changed too according to preferences- other tables didn't want lamb so had something else. Approx 150-180 pax with wine. Enjoy
5
We had our wedding anniversary in this restaurant. It's unpretentious and unassuming. We love the concept of Omakase. It really takes to burden of having to choose what to eat. We had read good reviews but still we were pleasantly surprised when the food started coming. Love the freshness of the ingredients and the authenticity.We love the wine selection too Will be patronising this restaurant again!Thank you for a great experience
5
From outset this was almost a private dining experience. The chefs come out to explain the dishes, and change the menu based upon dietary requirements.They were very friendly and the food of high quality. Although expensive, it is good value for money. Well worth repeat visit
5
Very refreshing, no menu . Very personalized dining experience. Service was excellent . Nice wine selection .
5
Brought my girlfriend for dinner here tonight and we find the food amazing. It is mt first time here. The service is also spectacular. They make an effort to check your food preferences before serving you. All their ingredients are fresh. Superb!!
5
We had a very nice experience at the restaurant with no menu.
The food was of a very good standard and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.
All in all, very enjoyable.
5
The first Italian themed chef's table style restaurant I've been to, and it was well worth the trip. The food is wonderful -- rich, tasty and delightfully surprising. The restaurant invites in a rotation of chef's from across Italy so you get a chance to experience food from different regions in Italy. Food aside, the service is also an experience - the staff is warm, friendly and attentive. I'll definitely go back
5
We are foodies and it appears that the Prime Minister is as well. Restaurant looks low key and unflashy, a bit out of the way (if there is such a thing in Singapore) . But well worth the effort. Exquisite italian cuisine - all small dishes had their distinct flavours. i arrived not particularly hungry but ate everything as they were so, so delicious. Service was competent and gracious. Special mention to Chomel who went out of her way to make our dining experience special. Her customer service is exemplary
5
The first Italian omakase concept I had visited. A warm welcomed by the owner kick started our meal. For $45++, we were offered with 7 courses lunch set.They constantly changed their menu so we weren't know what they would be serving until the moment the dish arrived. Really exciting to eat and super worth it!!!
5
Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here in mid-dec, (wanted to write a review then but I went overseas and it slipped my mind!) and both of us enjoyed the experience tremendously. Right from the reservation to the end of the meal, service was attentive and top-notch. Everyone served with a smile and we felt really at home here. The food was mouth-wateringly delicious and we scraped up every morsel. Best of all, for the quality of food and service we received, the bill was surprisingly reasonable and I didn't feel like I broke my wallet. Would highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back!
4
The chef is very welcoming, the degustation menu is diverse, tasty, and has a decent wine menu. The restaurant is well run, somehow it has managed to get to #1 in TripAdvisor singapore. Should be top 50 but not #1.Anyway would definitely be back for good food and servic
5
Wonderful service even from pre-dinner. Chef Chomel was truely committed to get us a table for me and my wife for our Anniversary. Each dishes was explained with care and our server was the most candid and cheerful soul! Definitely helped to boast our dinner.We were taking our time, chatting through dinner and they didn't rushed us through our 2.5hours sitting! Finally a restaurant that actually wants you to truely enjoy yourself!Our 10 courses was splendid. Each bite gave us an explosion in our mouth and our preference was well taken care off. Bill was well worth every penny and I couldn't thank them enough for the wonderful evening for me and my wife
4
Your lunch/dinner is in the chef's hands and it's worth it. Every one of the 6 courses we had was wonderful. The price was even better, I could not believe that we'd get such quality for such a small price. Greta place to go for a business lunch or romantic experience. Intimate while being lively. Will be returning, highly recommended
5
It's expensive, but worth every dollar. Love the menu-free service - they ask you your vegetarian/ meat preferences, and slowly roll out 14 or more delicious courses. And a good wine selection too.
4
Food very nice.. Service is gud..........Coming back soon... Gud experience in this restaurant.... Gambateh!!!!!!!!
5
Everything is perfect here, the service, the food, the atmosphere! The waiter was extremely attentive. Wines were great.
5
I thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes and the wonderful service topped the evening and made it special for us...thank you!
5
This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. Each dish is outstanding, with each course perfectly prepared with rich flavors and beautifully presented. This has become a favorite for friends and business associates. Great experience!!
5
I had a fantastic dinner at Fratini a few days ago for the Christmas Eve dinner 2016. Chef Chomel is a formidable cook and creates absolutely unique and super tasty dishes. It has been my second time at that restaurant and I brought my mother this time to enjoy the special day and meal with us. I am glad I made that decision to go to Fratini. If I remember correctly, we got 14 dishes with fine ingredients from Italy. Definitely high end fine dining experience for a very decent price. I can highly recommend it
4
Been here on a Friday evening. Made the reservation online and was an hour early at 6pm. We were promptly directed to our table inside. restaurant was quite empty then - few tables only and service was good and attentive. There is no menu and they asked for dietary restrictions. The food served was of good quality: cold appetizer which included scallop, salmon with pumpkin, beef with mushroom etc. next few dishes such as slip lobster, fish, truffles pasta are very good too. The dessert were also nice and we asked for second serving of tiramisu. Overall a nice dinner. The only disappointing thing is the restaurant gets really busy around 8pm, there is a rowdy group next to us and there are only two waiter in the restaurant. We waited over fifteen min to ask for coffee and in the end decided to go to counter to get bill and leave because of the noise and slow service. Would recommend to go early and leave before crowd comes in
5
I selected this place for my birthday.there is only 1 menu at 90 SGD. it consists of 7+ courses.we had the chance to get full explanation from the co-owner.it is a wonderful experience if you are ready to spend that level of money.this place deserved to be top-ranked
4
My friends and I came to Fratini for a Christmas dinner, and Fratini did not disappoint!!! The surprise dinner menu was well balanced and staff were able to enthusiastically explain the origins of the dishes. We would like to specially mention the good service we received from Chomel, Jan and Vincent
5
Came here for our anniversary dinner. The fact that there is no menu means there's always anticipation of what's next on our table which makes it an interesting dining experience. We were not disappointed at all as every course served was delectable and the entire 7-course dinner covered a good spread from appetizer, meats, seafood, pasta to dessert! Every course was decadent but my favourites were the lamb chop with herb crust, wagyu beef and truffle pasta. Since we got to taste a wide spread with a small portion each (they were quite generous actually cos my stomach filled up rather quickly), it's definitely good value for money for us
4
My family and I had lunch at Fratini today, and were very warmed by both the food and service. The dishes were well-plated and delivered with tantalising descriptions. We enjoyed our afternoon, and all return.
5
This was one of the best Italian meals I've had. The tasting portions were great, as we got to try all kinds of flavours and textures. Everything was perfectly prepared, and the chef Chomel Yong explained which regions in Italy the recipe came from.
5
We truly enjoyed the dinner we had at Fratini La Trattoria. Every dish was fresh, tasty, and so much variety in one sitting. The service was superb also. We will definitely go back.
1
No one listened when asked about food issues, allergies, or concerns (The server asked; we had some -- fell on deaf ears), two of the dishes were impossible to discern in the dim light outside, and the bill was really high. I don't understand the hype. Disappointed (again)
4
We were at Fratini to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it's easily one of the nicest places to celebrate a special occasion! The staff is warm, friendly, and knowledgeable. They explained every dish right from the origins to the ingredients and cooking methods. We just sat back, relaxed, and ate some delicious food!There were cold and warm appetizers (Zucchini Rollatini with Pumpkin & Ricotta, Grilled Tomato with Burrata & Kiwi Salsa, Cabbage & Wild Rice, Mushrooms), a variation of Eggplant Parmigiana, Grilled Cabbage with Scarmoza, Roasted Portobello with Ricotta, Pasta Arabiatta with Burrata, and a dessert platter (Lavender Panna Cotta, Tiramisu, Creme Brulee). The variety of vegetables was refreshing and the Lavender Panna Cotta was beyond brilliant
4
The evening got off to a bad start when the "vegetarian friendly" and "vegan options" promoted in the TripAdvisor summary of the restaurant, as explained by the waitress, turned out to be puff more than substance. My wife ended up just eating a pasta course. On the other hand I enjoyed every dish, welcomed the detailed explanation given of the structure and origin of the dish, and could not manage more than five courses; finishing with a beautifully presented assortment of aged cheeses at a perfect eating temperature. My sense was that the decision when to stop eating is largely up to you and there is no requirement to experience the entirety of the courses available. Because so many courses can be presented it may be more of a restaurant for small groups than for couples. The wine selection is extensive and expensive, but not unreasonably so given the depth and breadth of the wine list and with many wines off list. The Amarone was outstanding and there was a selection of Amaro digestifs - the mark of a good Italian restaurant. If your party will eat a variety of fish and meat dishes this is a great place, if not reserve with care
5
Chef Chomel and the staff are friendly and their services are excellent.We have 7-10 courses each for our lunch.We are served with 3 cold appetisers, 3 hot appetisers (meats) and the main we have are pasta which we choose truffles pasta and seafood pasta and lastly our desserts are tiramisu, chocolate salami and vanilla panna cotta.All the foods and desserts we have at Frantini are top-notched especially the truffles pasta!What an unforgettable experience we have
5
Made our lunch reservation almost a month before. We arrived at Fratini just after 12.30pm and the restaurant was bustling with tables of excited customers. I'd recommend making a reservation in advance to not be disappointed. I reckon it's a full house almost every lunch and dinner. We were shown to our table, where our waitress informed us there was no menu and the food was based on what was fresh at the market that day. The waitress asked for our food preferences and any allergies - no beef and less dairy for us and off she went to fetch us our appetisers. The appetisers were served on a long wooden board and each from a different part of Italy. The scallop with creamy bacon sauce was satisfying to say the least. Also enjoyed the salmon with minced mushrooms. The next course was pork (shaped into little nuggets) and sweet potato mash. Delicious! This course was followed by fish with lemon sauce, slices of lamb with a potato wedge (soooo good!) and then my favourite dish of all.... truffle pasta!! A big pan of hot creamy pasta was served with black truffle cooked al dente in a cream base. Every bite was a treat! We ended the meal with 3 little desserts, earl grey pana cotta, tiramisu and chocolate salami? Each one the perfect size and topped off with strong fragrant black coffee. The lunch set is priced at $45++ per person. We both had a glass of white wine ($16) and a black coffee at the end ($5) which brought the bill to about under $130. Decent for the quality, variety and gastronomical experience. I would definitely recommend this place! Delicious food and friendly staff! The young lady that served us was extremely accommodating and chatted with us about our trip to Singapore. I understand that the menu differs day to day and you never know what you're going to get! Guess that makes this little treasure of a place even more special!
5
Bestie brought me there for a surprise birthday dinner. He insisted it has to be Fratini La Trattoria or nothing else. I am so glad he made the very right choice. Exceptionally Amazing food, very reasonable wine and outstanding service! We are so in love with Chef Chomel, she is EXTRAORDINARY! Very impressed with her skills, her knowledge, explanation of each dish and her bubbliness!Already reserved a table for my family to go back on 23rd Dec, can't wait to show off her culinary skills to my gang!Thanks Team Fratini, WELL DONE! Highly recommended this restaurant
5
I have come twice in a month with different groups of friends who are as impressed as I am with the excellent food and wonderful service of this restaurant. We were raving about each superb dish and savouring every last bit on our plates. Personal compliments to Chef Chomel who succeeded in making us feel like we were on a taste tour across Italian regions with her detailed and passionate introduction to each dish, which included how all the ingredients were sourced or inspired by Italy - so we learnt about the origins of the dish as we enjoyed them. She even takes the effort to remember and remind me of details from my first visit and that was a nice touch. I honestly liked every dish from the starters through the seafood, red meats, pasta (especially the truffle pasta) to the mix of desserts - and will definitely come back for more
5
Great variety and quality of food. An unique culinary experience! Would definitely go back to the restaurant again! Chef is thoughtful and friendly. Interesting to know the inspiration behind every unique dish.
5
I called in here on business in September but due to work load and travel commitments I have not had time to review. The food was a delight as was the service would recommend truffle pasta, Beef cheeks and tiramisu
5
Come here tonight for my surprised birthday dinner and was completely blown away by the flavors and service.
5
Just perfect. Food, wine, service. You will not regret. Go for the Truffle pasta. Will definitely come back!

I enjoyed the surprising lunch they created for me at Frantini La Trattoria on Greenwood Ave in Hillscrest Park. The explanations helped me understand the differences of Italian cousines in different regions of Italy. They know how to combine the seafoods, meats, vegetables, and sauces. Great service, great foods, I am glad I went today. When you visit Singapore and you want a mellow good lunch, you must try.偶然發現這個美食桃花源上網查出這家義大利餐廳排名在前，決定去品嚐午餐。服務很好，食物新鮮有創意，詳細的說明讓我覺得自己走了一趟義大利

Had lunch on our wedding anniversary. This was our first time at the restaurant. The restaurant does not have a menu and no price list ... cool...Jen a partner owner asked us for our preferences and then the courses started coming in. Four sets of cold and hot starters, followed by a main course and three different deserts.The food taste and combination was amazing, and the quantity was just right. The restaurant maintains a data of what was served so that it is not repeated on the next visit.... and to top it all the price was reasonable. The service was excellent. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the food and the ambience and that in it self is an unqualified endorsement. Will definitely place it on our favorite list and visit again and again.Valet parking is available. Tourists can take a cab, the restaurant is 15 mins from down town.This restaurant should be rated No.1 in Singapore

I came here with the wife. We managed to get an outdoors reservation when I called on the day itself but were moved inside as there was a cancellation. There's no menu, I think we had at least 8 courses. Food was in small dainty portions but cumulatively it was extremely filling even for a big eater like me. The food was all good and we left no crumbs! The best dish was the simplest, a pasta in truffle oil and mushroom puree. Very well balanced and not overly salty. Cost was $230 including one alcoholic drink. The service was fantastic, the staff were all cheerful and joked with us throughout our meal. They even brought us a slice of cake with a candle as they thought it was our anniversary. Easily the most enjoyable meal I've had in Singapore. Will definitely be back

We went here for a birthday dinner and it was incredible. Chomel and the staff were so warm and friendly, offering a very personal service from beginning to end and accommodating my vegetarian husband. The restaurant has a great concept: the staff selected the food for us after a brief chat about what we did and didn't like to eat, and everything we ate was really tasty. They even surprised us with a little birthday treat. And as it was Christmas we got to pick a 'gift' from the Christmas tree that turned out to be free coffee and digestifs. If we are ever in Singapore again we will definitely be coming back!Thank you guys for a wonderful experience and delicious food.

Ok, first things first, come with a big appetite. The food is non-stop, and plentiful. The menu is chosen by the incredibly talented chefs and its course after course (i think it was about 12 to 14 courses) followed by 4 (bite sized) desserts. My only complaint was it was too much of a good thing. It would be great to have a few options to opt in or out of as it felt wrong not to try things but was just so full. The stand out dishes that arrived were the scallops, the prawns, the truffle pasta (dont miss this!!) , the beef, the mushroom and beef appetizer. Those that ate the pork said it was so delicious. Nothing could be faulted. On top of amazing food was incredible warm, charismatic and attentive service. This restaurant is a true gem and it provided us with an very special and memorable experience. Thank you to the team at Fratini, we loved every minute of being there

I came by for dinner on a weekday evening after constant recommendation from a friend as what was described as great Italian food, Omakase style. The restaurant was easy to find if you're familiar with the Greenwood row of restaurants and ambience was nice and cozy. The service and staff were impeccable and it really made the dinner a very enjoyable experience. As expected, there was no menu, just course after course of great food that were very palatable and savoury. I didn't specify any dietary restrictions so I was also given lamb and tuna -- food I generally wouldn't order, but surprisingly enjoyed at Fratini La Trattoria. I'll definitely recommend this place for it's no-menu concept, excellent service and amazing food
5
Don't ask for the menu - There isn't one! $45++ gets you a delectable surprise 8-course meal. It started off with 3 perfectly crafted appetisers from different parts of Italy, then a fish, lamb, beef cheek (oh so tender!) then pasta. We ended the meal on a sweet note with tiramisu, pistachio panna cotta and biscotti. Service was at a measured pace so we took 1.7 hours for lunch - not too good for a business lunch so go when, like us, it is a relaxing day.
5
Great venue with beautiful setup. Nice layout without being too cramp or empty. The first feeling of stepping into the restaurant gives a sense of exclusiveness and coziness. Greeted by staff who wears a big smile and a dedicated person to serve my table.All we needed to do was to share what we don't eat and the rest of the night was taken care of. The dishes were plated beautifully. Favourite dishes was the tender lamb tender and tiramisu.Definitely will go back again
5
I have visited fratini a few times now, and each experience has always been better then the one before. From its carefully crafted meals to the friendly staff and the ever attentive chef Chomel. The attention to details is something that should not go unnoticed and it's a feast to the eye as well as the palate. Thanks for making the experience a wee bit special and keep up the high standards. Kevi

What an incredible place!I always turn to Trip Advisor for my reviews and I'm not surprised this restaurant was rated #1.The first thing that grabbed me was that they don't have a menu. I love that.They ask about any allergies, about any dislikes and then they go ahead and do their thing.I looked at what others were having, thinking they probably do the same thing for everyone. Wrong. Each table was getting something different. The Chef obviously really enjoys a challenge!I am a vegetarian and the meal was just delightful. My wife isn't and she too was extremely impressed. Her lamb was tender and a beautiful pink. 12 months earlier and I would have stolen it off her plate!The staff are also attentive and very helpful. The wine list is great too.This was a wonderful experience

Today is my second visit to Fratini, first was a business related meal. Been telling my family and friends about this place, today decided to bring wife and daughter there for lunch. It was not the same Italian meal whereby we struggled to understand the menu and decided to order the familiar. Our host, Chomel greeted us warmly and explained the concept of her restaurant - no menu, tell us what you can't or dislike, and trust us to feed you properly. Chomel and her team more than fed us properly, the variety of food and quantity hit the right spot. The ambiance was relaxed, the host stopped by for conversations and every palate was served with explanation of the ingredients and how they were prepared. The lunch crowd filled up the front hall with a couple of tables at the back avail; we were told Fridays and Saturdays are always packed - reservation is a must. Overall a great experience, wife and daughter were happy; the former busy taking pictures for the social media. I have made reservation to bring my team (from the office) for a year-end meal next week

A no-menu restaurant is always a big risk. But if you are no1 at Tripadvisor, it must be good!It was ok, thats all. No WoW factor and to be honest, not much Italian dishes to be found. That main course is your choice of pasta. I want the chef to surprise me with a unbelievable Unique pasta. But nothing of this. Just an average seefood linguini. Biggest let down was the cleannessof the restaurant. All frames and egdes full of dust and the wall mouldy and dirty. No excuse for that. The staff is clearly not proper, restaurant trained. Friendly, but not professional.For this price, we will not return again
5
Been to fratini la trattoria few times. The latest being last Friday night. The meal & friendly service was excellent as usual. The most memorable dishes for me were the beef cheeks, rack of Lamb & pasta. The degustation I had was full of hearty meaty dishes.. just the way I love it and was pretty full before having the pasta.However the pasta was so good I had no problems downing it. It's a 'simple' pasta with black summer truffles... the authentic way to enjoy the aroma truffles. Absolutely die die must try. Thanks to everyone @ fratini, molto bene & have a merry Xmas.
5
So we decided to celebrate my hubby birthweek :p in Singapore at Fratini La Trattoria with our best friends. Well treated and best service from the Chef Chomel Yang. She's really impressed us with all her knowledge about food and surrounding. Fun and very professional on the way she's manner the introduction for every dishes. That's how I want to record her name for special mention! Seafood is their strength! Fresh and Tasty. Pasta with truffle is the best option for the main course. So they served us with 14 dishes from Appetisers to Desserts. We can't move after that, we can only roll to the car :). One good thing need to mention to is they have very good wine, should take the wine to pair with your dinner. Little Xmas treat from them and we are so lucky to get their second best prize from the lucky draw. Of course we will back soon for the prize! Cheer
5
Had lunch with friends here - first time experience of "omakase" Italian dining. Great ambient, fantastic food and amazing service. Chomel and her team took every efforts to tell us more about what we were having - they can see their pride and passion! Will sure be back again.
5
... this place has such good reviews. Went on a Saturday for lunch for a birthday celebration and was left thinking it was one of the best meals we have had in Singapore. Ended up having 7 courses with every one being amazing, all without the need to even look at a menu. The staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly and even provided an additional pasta serving when we mentioned our first was so good. Already trying to figure out a date to come back
5
The restaurant is very good,and they have no menu,but the food is really good taste and special,and the staff are nice.
5
We finally tried this nice restaurant without menu ;-) I have to say I have been very surprised and also very happy to find such a restaurant in Singapore. Not only the food is excellent but the staff provides a very high service with smile and kindness.In total, we have tried 14 different dishes for a dinner (special reward to the truffles pasta !) and we had a beautiful evening with my Husband.I wouldn't recommend this restaurant in the evening for young children but they told us they can adjust for lunch easily.Super address that you cannot miss in Singapore

It has been a real pleasure to celebrate our anniversary lunching at Fratini! We could see the chefs' toil and love behind the wonderful appetizers and mains. We never liked lamb but the way lamb was done in Fratini blew our mind. The hot and cold appetizers are extremely refined and flavorful. The slight disappointment is that the tiramisu was a little mushy and lack of flavor depth but the sesame panna cotta made up for it to finish a fantastic meal. We really appreciate the team's wonderful service, Chomel was great at distracting our three-year old so that we can savour the flavors of the food. Thank you
5
We loved the surprise tasting menu with highlights from around Italy such as crayfish with bisque sauce from Sardinia and succulent pork from Rome. It is the right balance of meat and seafood. Service was friendly and accommodating as we tried to squeeze in dinner before collecting our kids from their concert and then took a break to collect them. The kids were happy to join us for dessert and loved the chocolate salami, creme brûlée and sorbet. We are planning to take the kids back for a leisurely dinner especially as there is a kids tasting menu
5
I had dinner with a girlfriend at Fratini and the experience was above and beyond. We felt at home the moment we stepped into the restaurant. Not only was the food exceptional, the service was spectacular too. Our fav from the night was definitely the beef cheeks, they were super soft!! Servers were friendly and careful to explain each dish as it was served. We loved every moment and would come back in a heartbeat. This is one experience you don't wanna miss out
5
This is a great restaurant to visit if you're with good friends who love food and you have a lot of time. The meal will take at least 3 hours and features a succession of lovely, well-prepared and delicious things. The owner of the restaurant, Chomel and her team are firmly grounded in the restaurant trade and she has interesting ideas of what she likes to eat and how to eat it. That results in an Italian meal that is tailored to your table's preferences and allows you to have a good tasting amount of many things. As my friend remarked, it's like an omakase Italian meal! Yes, and the noodles come at the end, like a Chinese banquet so you can properly enjoy the delicious scallops, yabbies, perfectly roasted Frenched lamb chops and beautifully executed slices of garoupa before eating the unbelievably wonderful beef tenderloin noodles in beef marrow jus. That noodle dish was amazing and I wish I could have it again now. For pudding, they had four different desserts but the one that I cannot forget is their hazelnut panna cotta. Made with a hazelnut praline that was pulverised and mixed into the panna cotta it had caramelised nutty notes in a wobbly creamy matrix. Heaven

It was our first time visiting this quaint little restaurant at Greenwood which doesn't have a menu. Such things excite my taste buds :) We eat everything so it was open to the chef's recommendation. There were cold and hot appetisers similar to tapas. I personally loved the cured salmon. Lamb loin was cooked to perfection and served with a delicious purple potato mash. My partner liked the slow cooked beef cheeks. The highlight of the meal was the truffle pasta. Handmade by top chefs and flown in from Italy, it was a special porous pasta with a delightful springy texture. I always struggle with pasta because it's either too soggy or too hard beyond al dente. Pasta can't be soft or chewy. This was perfect, and toped off with shaved truffle bits. Tagliatelle goes very well with the heavy truffle cream sauce. You need the thick body of the pasta to balance out the sauce. Dessert in my opinion was overly sweet. Panna cotta would be perfect without the hazelnut layer. The tiramisu needs some solid, hard biscuits to soak up the coffee and sugar. Finally, the Lavazza espresso was an excellent end to our lunch. I will be back just to try their fresh hand made pastas. In my opinion the food, level of customisation, service and value for money ranks among the best in Singapore. For sure better than Italian osteria or mozza osteria.
5
What a fantastic experience Chomel looked after us right from booking the table until we left, I have to admit I was a bit dubious due to their being no menu especially as I am a fussy eater, vegetarian and allergic to mushrooms, and this being a special occasion, I am no easy customer - WOW is the best word to describe every thing that was brought to our table, my husband has never seen me clear so many plates and so happily the food was just perfect in every way, small taster plates constantly brought to your table at an easy pace we never felt rushed neither were we left waiting too long between courses - This place is an absolute must for any foodies visiting or living in Singapore - we will definitely retur
5
I was amazed that the best fine dining in Singapore was not in the high flying 5* restaurants but down a quite lane in Singapore.. the success of this restaurant is the food and the service.. the portions were perfect, well presented and 7 course meal at its best.. the Chef is an amazing host and given it doesn't have a menu, this restaurant is a different dining experience all together.. Great place for excellent Italian dining..
5
We dined here after a long gap. Food and service were awesome again. The surprise of what comes next (since there is no menu) is part of the enjoyment of dining here. We will be back again. Fratini La Trattoria is one of the finest Italian restaurants of Singapore. Italian dining experience in Singapore is not complete without a visit to this restaurant
5
Visited Fratini 3 weeks ago for the first time and I am back for seconds. Indeed it's a very personalized experience each time. Food is delicious, service is superb and ambience cosy. Well worth the visit!
5
Visited this place many times since the first visit....consistently great and fabulous food with top-notch service. It is no wonder that this place is ranked No. 1 on Tripadvisor.
5
One of the Best Food you could find in Singapore! The Chef even customised vegetarian full course dinner for us!Staff is really friendly with Great Service! The food is amazing and full of surprises!!!Michelin level! Will Definitely come back anytime soon! <3
5
Great food, extremely varied set menu which contained beef, lobster, scallop, lamb, duck, sea bass and tuna... well priced and the service was fantastic. Highly recommended.
5
We liked everything that was presented but was specially surprised with the Hungarian pork, which was really good! It's was a good dining experience and the owner was patient enough to explain each dish to us. I reckon you to check it out! Alert: There is no menu!
5
This restaurant is quite a taxi ride from the centre of Singapore.Although describing itself as "Italian" it has a lot more to it. Firstly, there is no menue . Dinner is served in tasting courses with multiple choices and something for everyones taste. Absolutely super food with comprehensive explanations and guidance. The staff here are exceptional ,really very helpful.We were so glad to have made the visit.Not cheap, but is anything in Singapore 
5
Unusual concept, in that the chef decides the course after knowing one's dietary restrictions and preferences. We ordered a vegetarian meal and the courses supplied were delicious. The starters, the pasta, and the desserts were very tasty. If at all, I have a complaint, and nothing is perfect in this world, it was the time taken for serving the courses. It is not often that I have spent more than two hours over a lunch!
4
Came here for our 15th wedding anniversary and it wasn't quite special enough.Not a great start, having to walk into the main area to get a waiter to take our first drinks order. And then the first course arrived before our champagne. Felt a bit rushed and uncoordinated by the service staff.The wine list is excellent and reasonable as was the food. The beef main was mouth watering and soft as butter, the truffle pasta was delicious. And i liked the way they served it in order fish-beef-pasta, different to normal and makes sense. That said, the rare beef(?) small entre was sinewy and too chewy so not well sourced or prepared.And the little things were missing. No bread. I asked for chilli's and never got them.I'd probably try it again for the food. Ambience is nice in the back room surrounded by bottles of wine
5
The best and most authentic Italian food I've had in Singapore so far. The meal is served similar to Japanese omakase (chef's choice), is always well-planed, and never fails to impress. For dinner we get to enjoy more than 10 different dishes, and from appetizer to dessert, each dish is meticulously prepared and cooked to perfection.The staff is always friendly and professional at the same time, and I always feel very well taken care of. One highlight for me personally is that the providence of each dish is always explained, adding a creative note to the experience.Will definitely go back regularly
3
Came here on a whim because it was the top-rated restaurant in Singapore on TripAdvisor. Service was friendly and conscientious. Prices were reasonable. $90 degustation - about 15 bites of food - that left us full. Wine was fairly priced too. The 'no menu' concept was appealing. But the food, while tasty, was decidedly average. The pasta was not al dente, the lamb chop was stringy with thick strands on unrendered fat running through, a cold salmon starter bite smelt like it had spent a little too much time in the fridge, lobster was somewhat mushy rather than firm, tiramisu needed to spend much more time soaking in liquer. In general the raw materials left something to be desired. Some of the sauces that accompanied were tasty though. Decently priced meal for decently average food. If you want good Italian in greenwood I would recommend rubato next door or la bresceria around the back
5
Food was excellent and Chef gave detailed explanation of where each dish originated from. Will return for more!!
4
We have been here twice - the menu ha always been a nice surprise and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It is not the cheapest option in town but worth a visit every now and then
5
More than 15 courses of tasty Italian fare. Included crayfish, beef, lamb, fish, crab & prawn dishes. Would go again to taste the other dishes when they vary the seasonal menu.
5
This is an Italian inspired restaurant with a no-menu concept. A degustation menu is provided, with some choices left to customers (dietary restrictions, allergies ...) . Everything is delicious, food is innovative, and the service from the young owner is impeccable. Worth a visit.
5
I loved this place tucked away off bukit timah road ... We went for their set lunch and one of us was vegetarian ::. They chose the food and wine and enlighten you as they serve ... We loved the preparations and the wine and at a reasonable price considering the gourmet quality All in all a great experience
3
Restaurant has no menuFood was above average - pasta wasn't very good. More variety would be bette
5
We were originally hesitant to try this restaurant because of the lack of a menu, but the high rating on Tripadvisor convinced us to take a chance. We're very glad we did, especially as the restaurant is quite willing to adjust the items served to one's dietary restrictions. Set in a suburban area, on a street with many restaurants, Fratini offers a pleasant setting, friendly and attentive staff (many of whom double as cooks and servers), and quite good food. We enjoyed a series of courses, including warm and cold appetizers, a warm fish course, shellfish (or a substitute meat), beef, lamb, pasta (with several choices), and a series of desserts, all in reasonable portions -- neither too large nor too small. The chef clearly knows his preparation, and several of the courses -- particularly the scallops, salmon, lobster, and appetizers with mushrooms -- were standouts. Apart from the desserts (e.g., panna cotta and tiramisu), the food seemed more continental than Italian, but we could hardly object, given its quality. Our one suggestion would be to include, whether as a dessert item or a palate refresher, a bit of gelato or sorbet, to help balance an otherwise very rich meal. All in all, it was a delightful find, and we hope to return before long
5
We went last year after a recommendation. We weren't disappointed and as promised we would receive superb service and quality food. We had hot & cold starters, several mains and several desserts. We chose a nice bottle of wine which cost about as much as the food so the evening wasn't cheap but a perfect way to treat my better half. Thanks for the excellent evening. We recommended it to friends who have since visited and hope to get back soon
5
My husband organised a surprise birthday dinner at Fratini La Tratorria on Saturday night. We were in the private dining room two tables for all 14 of us. Wow is all I have to say!! What an amazing night! The food was amazing. We tasted 14 different dishes I think in all 10 courses and each one was fabulous. The waitress was excellent and explained each course and what region of Italy it was from. The service, food, wine, ambience, ....everything made it an amazing birthday dinner. Will definitely be back again. Highly recommend you go with a group
5
Was curious to see how our second visit to Fratini La Trattoria would go after such a rewarding visit the first time. The valet parking (it is a busy area) started off another great experience.As promised the food was different from the first time, remember there is no menu, all courses were presented in their perfection with an accompanying explanation of what it was, how it was cooked and where it was from. All different in taste, portion size and how it was presented.The staff continue to be informed, enthusiastic and witty, always ready to share a laugh between serving food or drinks.Fratini still ranks as my number one favorite restaurant in Singapore
5
My parents and I attended this restaurant whilst visiting Singapore, based on the excellent reviews we had seen.
Both the food and service were delicious! We had a really nice evening here.
5
So happy to have discovered this lovely new place. The service was very good and the recommended dishes were extremely satisfactory. I loved the crayfish appetizer and the hazelnut panna cotta! Can't wait to come back for more!
5
Impressed with the service and food offered. Incredible experience at a quaint location. We tried the duck rilette for the cold appetizer which did not disappoint. My personal favourite was the hazelnut panna cotta. Definitely one of the best dining experience I've had, highly recommend.
5
Love this place! It's a chef's menu concept, so no need to choose. All the dishes were great, the service is wonderful. Brb her twice and I highly recommend it
5
Trust the chefs to whip up everything that you love; in which i did - no complaints for every dish that I had. Every single dish is gooood :) Just be sure to let the team know at the beginning if there is anything that you do not eat. Great for special occasions and service is really good. Thanks Jan and Chomel for the lovely dinner experience
5
My wife organized my birthday treat at the restaurant and invited four of our close friends to dine with us. It was our first time dining here and we were blown away! It certainly lived up to all expectations, as we were served 14 different dishes from seafood to rib-eye steak in a no-menu, omakase style. As the birthday 'boy', I loved the melt-in-the-mouth lamb shank so much that I decided to place an extra order of the same.The only downside to an otherwise perfect birthday celebration, perhaps was that it took more than 45 minutes for it to be served. By which time, we were already about to have our desserts.To say that it was a good meal is an understatement. A more accurate way of describing it is, perhaps "a truly unforgettable gastronomic experience"
5
Service was excellent! Trusted the chef to serve us something we love and it was such a pleasant delight. The duck rilette cold appetizer was good. And so was the wagyu beef appetizer. My boyfriend had the crayfish and it was great as well! Ended the meal with a hazelnut panna cotta and it was divine. Would love to bring my family to visit again one day
5
First time dining at Fratini and i've got to say it was a great experience! The omakase style of dining is really refreshing as it relieves me of the dilemma of having to decide what to order. Service was excellent and the food was heavenly! Some dishes i would like to recommend are: Cold appetizer: Duck riletteHot appetizer: Wagyu beef; crayfishDessert: Hazelnut panna cottaA great place to pamper your tastebuds! :
5
OMG!!! Just got back from an amazing lunch! What a little gem tucked away in greenwood! The food was outstanding-both regular and vegetarian sets!!! Such fresh produce... You could actually taste the freshness! Service was lovely too- special shout out to Chomel for ensuring are food came timely as my friend was in a bit of a rush. My only regret- I lived in the neighbourhood for 3 years and just moved recently and only now did I learn about this place! This is going to become my favourite go to lunch place in SG! Loved it
5
We had a superb lunch at Fratini La Trattoria with an exceptionally high quality of food - certainly the best meal we have had in Singapore.No menus are provided so you need to trust the chef, which is advised when the ingredients (sourced from across Italy) and cooking is this good.I highly recommend a visit
5
We had our 6 years anniversary here and the food was great with variety.
The staff is very friendly as well that introduces every dishes in details.
5
A fantastic Italian meal in singapore that was also great for vegetarians. Excellent service!! Will definitely come back!
5
This is the third time I come to this place. It is by far the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Ssingaapore..
5
Great recommendation from a friend, great experience and every dish comes with introduction and explanation of what it is . Great service staff !!!!
Very good selection of wine and the menu changes regularly .
Good place for dinner and chill !!
5
Went to the restaurant for dinner to celebrate my daughter's birthday. As there was no menu, we basically had to trust the chef to surprise us with his culinary skills. And all of us were impressed with the food presentation, taste and quality. There were many courses to eat from red meat to seafood. The quantity served was just right for us. We just need to tell the staff what we don't eat and that's all....Every course served was special and very tasty. We spent $620 for 5 persons plus 3 glasses of wine n 5 hot drinks. Reasonable pricing for the quality of food & 90 points Parker ratings wine.Cons were the birthday cake prepared for my daughter was real small n not nice, and we did not get to see the chef whom we thought would come out n talk to the patrons
5
We visit Singapore at least two to three times a month and we take the pleasure of enjoying the many delightful eating holes and this place is definitely on our top of the list moving forward. We also had the pleasure of meeting the amiable owners. Kudos for giving this place a unique experience. Who needs a menu anyway. We look forward to coming back again.
5
My husband planned this surprise meal for the last night of our holiday which also happened to be our 20th wedding anniversary. WOW it was wonderful. From the minute we walked into the place we were treated like friends. The staff were so happy and proud in their work and it showed. The food.....well every mouthfull was delightful. I am the fussiest of eaters and I ate every one of the 14 dishes placed before me. I can honestly say this is one of if not the best meal I have had. I so wish this lovely little restaurant was at least in Europe if not England!!! Keep doing just what you are dong and dont change a thing. AND thankyou for making our anniversary such a special one
5
This has to be one of the best resteraunt we have eaten at ever!!!! I found this resteraunt via trip advisor and booked for our 20th wedding anivesary having read all the great reviews. Chomel was the best host ever helping me through booking and changing the date and when we got there was superb talking us through each item. The meal was an equisit surprise trip through Italy in Singapore each course delightful. This place is as good as any Michelin Stared place in any country of the world and with the warmest friendliest staff to match. If you are coming to Singapore you must visit it's worth the 12 hour flight alone!!!!thanks to all at Fratini La Trattoria for ending our holiday on such a great hig
5
Went with our 4.5year old for anniversary celebration. Place is more suited for couples but the restaurant went out of their way to make sure our child was comfortable and enjoying herself. Special shout out to Chomel, Jan and Vincent for excellent service. Would definitely be back again!!! Awesome food and worth its price. Wine was a tad pricey by glass so would by the bottle next time :)
5
The Fratini team was spot on with their service, attention to detail and wonderful dishes. I appreciated the description of the meal (no menu) confirmation about allergies and dislikes before enjoying a special Sunday brunch.I will keep them on my list for future trips to Singapore
5
My fiancé and I had a fantastic evening dining out for his birthday. The staff were friendly, easy going and very
Every course was a surprise. Food was delicious. So many different flavours and everything was fresh.
We are looking forward to our next visit.
5
Was a little wary as this was deemed numero uno resto in Singers but it lived up to its rating and we had a fabulous meal with excellent service. Thanks.
5
Excellent restaurant. Very delicious dishes and very nice background music. The staff was very friendly and helped us to choose the tastiest dishes from the menu.
5
Went after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed. The food was absolutely amazing (the beef was the best we have ever had) !
A real team effort and they should all be very proud of the restaurant they have created !
5
We decided to book based on the reviews that we read. Right from the moment that we walked in, we knew that we were going to have a great evening. We were seated to our table immediately and then Chomel explained the concept to us, and checked with us as to any food we don't eat / allergies.Over the following 2 hours we were delighted by the quality of the food and the enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff that looked after us. There were 3 or 4 servers who looked after us during the evening, and each knew about the dishes that they were bringing and clearly had a passion for what they do.Each course was just about the right size - enough food to appreciate the flavours and the cooking, but not too much so that we were full after the first few dishes. By the time we were finished, we had experienced a host of meat and fish dished, complemented with a variety of vegetables and some perfectly cooked pasta.The lack of menu made for a more interesting evening, as we didn't know what to expect next. But we were happy to sit back and let the team take care of us, and we were certainly not disappointed. We will be returning in a few weeks with our family to share the experience. We can't wait to see what's in store for us next time

We had high expectations about it:1) Excellent staff and great explanation of every dish. They made all the changes requested which is nice to see and well appreciated!2) Food:- The first set of dishes were ok but nothing exceptional. Not tasteful as it looks...- The chicken with with potato gratin was just a chocker as the tomato sauce tasted like can tomato- Wine was good- I feel the italian chef has left and the restaurant may have lost its taste that made it number 1 on trip advisor- 300 dollars for this dinner is way too much. It lacks taste although presentation and service are great- I went to candlenut restaurant (local food with michelin star) and would recommend it any day compared to this restauran

It was my first visit so was an excellent opportunity to invite my guest from South America along. When told by Ms. Chomel that there was no menu on the table, both of us knew that we are on an exciting adventure into Italian dining with fine wines. It was a visual treat the way the foods were presented & perfectly served. I am very thankful that both of us have had a wonderful dining experience. Next time round, I will bring my family on board.
5
Let me start with the moment we walked through the door. Very warm welcome. Friendly smiles and great staff. After being seated we were told about the whole concept of the restaurant which was no menu and all we had to do was inform them if we had any allergies. From then on all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the dishes that came. The appetizers were on point! The steak was cooked perfectly! The truffle pasta in the end made our evening! Would definitely come again next time we visit Singapore!
5
Fabulous meal with amazing and friendly services by Chomel and all the other waiters! Chomel made sure all the courses matched our food preferences, we even had a chance to choose our pasta (went with Truffle!). Professional with detailed explanation of each course when presenting it to us. It's definitely a must try place in SG (if you like a little surprise with your meal)! I can't wait to go back again for another great experience :)

Booked this restaurant as a birthday celebration, based off reviews and the unique concept. We weren't disappointed, food and service were excellent. The seafood was definitely the highlight, meat dishes were a bit of a let down by comparison but by no means bad. Service was rapid but we were in early. Table next to us asked for little to no seafood, within their rights to do so but I feel like they missed out on some of the best this restaurant has to offer. Nothing we had was too outrageous, regular food done extremely well and paired in interesting combinations. It's a little out of the way if you are staying in the city like we were, ~$18 taxi one way, but even factoring this in the meal was great value. 4 cold starters, 4 hot starters, pasta main and 5 desserts tea and coffee for ~$120 pp, one could easily pay double the price for a similar menu elsewhere.
5
AMAZING 7-12 courses meal, one of the best places we ate in ever. Value for money is great lunch 50$ per person (that's what we did) and dinner 90$. Meat dishes is served to perfection pastas were less special but still fantastic. Don't miss it!!
5
Great food, Nice ambiance and fantastic staff! They now what service is !
It was a delicious discovery of the variety of the Italian kitchen. Beautiful presentation but most important tasteful combinations with all the fresh ingredients!
4
Go there now, would be my advice.
No menu but a quick chat about available ingredients, allergies, likes and dislikes started a very pleasurable lunch experience. Food was the best I had in Singapore, well presented and it tasted fantastic. Service was impeccable.

I've been to Fratini with my wife and the girl who greeted us wowed us from the beginning to the end witg her confidence and knowledge about the food served there. The chefs completed the opera with their beautiful and delicious dishes. I didn't give 5 stars just because I can't stand to see a waiter too busy checking the mobile phone to see that the customers need something. I had to wait 5 mins before he realised I needed another bottle of water.
5
We celebrated 2 gfs birthdays here in the wine cellar private room. The no menu was excellent and a delight to eat and see. I was not neglected as a vegan. Chef Chomel's vegan dishes were of Michelin standards served with pride of the highest standard freshest ingredients and with love and passion. We were impressed enough to come back again and again.
5
We went here for lunch and had a wonderful experience. We were served three cold appetisers each, followed by three warm appetisers, a pasta dish and then three desserts each. We were even given two pasta dishes as we couldn't pick between the truffle or seafood pasta. Both were delicious! The service was second to none and or waiter (I think his name was Jen) was very attentive, explaining each dish in detail. Thank you for a lovely lunch and wonderful experience.
4
I had my partner's birthday dinner there as he was being recommended to this restaurant and would like to give it a try.No menu. The server will check what u cant eat and be prepared to be wow-ed by the food presented to you! Every single piece!!The restaurant is small and cosy with more than adequate and attentive service that add on to the amazing experience. We were being walked through on the tasting menu dish by dish and we can tell they are very serious in getting the food done not just beautifully and also the taste and freshness.I love the pasta the most!!! (brown sauce beef tenderloin pasta)The wine list is quite a good range and the experience is very pleasant. **THUMBS UP**Fine dining italian food at a very reasonable pric

I selected this restaurant to celebrate my 8 years' anniversary and I booked from the Chope Reservations few days before. Restaurant called me 8 hours before my reserved dinner time and told me the restaurant was fully booked and we could only be seated outside. However, they promised to put us as the first guest on the waiting list and moved us inside air-conditioning as soon as possible. The restaurant did not provide any menu to the guest and we were happy to follow chef's recommendation. The dinner was not bad but not so much surprise. We finished the dinner around 7:45pm but we were never moved inside even though there were several empty tables. It costs us approx. 220SGD and I think it worth the value but I don't think this restaurant could be #1 selection in Singapore.
5
Went with friends for lunch on a Friday. It is a small restaurant in a local neighbourhood - we would never have found it without the Trip recommendations. These people are serious about their food, and their wine. We were taken with care through their tasting menu. All dishes were beautifully designed, both visually and for taste. However, there were a few stand-out dishes in what was memorable from start to finish. The truffle pasta is the best the four of us (all foodies) could remember eating anywhere. The rosemary panna cotta was perfectly balanced. There is an extensive Italian wine range and our host really knew his wines - his recommendations for both red and white were spot on. Graceful, charming and warm service throughout, we had a wonderful meal. This restaurant deserves all the accolades
5
Dine-in with 10 others in this restaurant through a recommendation of a friend!I must say - the recommendations deserved a good *thumbs up*! We were told there arent any menu to refer but that didnt disappoint us our tastebud at all for sure.Each dish was served with very detailed explanation by Chef Chomel Yang. Even one of our friends who is a vegan had her specially catered for dishes. She commented that "didnt know vegan dishes can be cooked in this manner" tooOverall, the dining experience is excellent! Even the service staff is great!If you are in for Fine-Dining Italian Style experience? This is THE place to go after
5
Found this restaurant on Trip advisor and went with a friend to try. No Menu concept worked very well!!! The Cheif accommodated my special requirements and did not disappoint. Staff was very friendly, nice and attentive. Overall very very pleased with this experience...
4
service,quality,choice-an experience worth having. There are many choices in Singapore and this is one wortht taking. I travel to Italy a great deal and have a house there-this restaurant puts you there.
4
They serve no menu cuisine. n every month they change the menu and up to the chef to create.
if you want to impress your partner for suprise date.. you can give this resto a try.
the price is SGD90/pax exclude beverages
4
The food served is very tasty and appetizing, the service provided was also good, the place was convenient to eat
5
This is my 2nd visit to Fratini. Chomel, a service staff remembered me from my first visit. She then promptly told me that she will check on what I ate the first time so that I won't eat the same dishes tonight. WOW! That is service quality for me. Every dish was excellent. We particularly enjoyed the beef and the truffle pasta was to die for.At $90 per head, it's a steal for the food, ambience and service. Don't think. Just go
4
I was thrilled to get a last minute booking over a long weekend when most people were away. It is a set degustation menu that they will tweak if you have any food issues. We chose to do the wine pairing which started with a crisp pinot gris, then a pinot noir and lastly a granache. Our cold starters was four small tasters, swordfish sashimi with olives, a mussel baked with pesto crumbs, confit of octopus on pumpkin purree and a beef roll stuffed with feta. Then we had a pan fried delicious foie gras with fig and roast shallot followed by beef cheek. We selected the truffle fettucine for our pasta dish (here you have the option to choose). Dessert was a creme brulee, tiramisu and a panna cotta. The meal was delicious and we were very happy with everything except the swordfish sashimi and the tiramisu, both of which lacked some punch and flavour. We left totally stuffed and happy. The meal was $90++ per head and the wine pairing was charged at 3 x glasses of wine each from their by the glass menu. This worked out slightly more expensive than having a bottle, but it was nice to pair
4
We had been recommended this restaurant by a few people and love Italian food. We made a booking for a Sunday night and arrived on time to find that we had to wait for our table. We were shown a seat to wait in their lovely garden but not offered and drink and kept waiting for at least 15 mins. When we did get our table, the service improved. The food was lovely and they had an amazing wine list or you could personally pick a bottle from their own cellar
3
The concept is great: no menu so you mention what you like at the start and surprise dishes come one after the other. We honestly found that the foods given were somehow "cheap" (except foie gras which is not so Italian) and easy to prepare in advance without the wow factor it needed in the taste. Some dishes were also very clichÃ© such as panacotta and tiramisu for desserts. Service is excellent but food lacked of originality, flavor and Italian flair. Would not go back
3
Went there to try upon a friend's recommendation. The restaurant is located in a little enclave where there are other Italian joints as well. Small, relatively cosy restaurant with a couple of tables on the outdoors - pretty nice to sit there when there's not many cars, else I suppose the fumes can be a bit much. We chose the indoors. Upside: service staff were warm and friendly, with a good grasp of the menu. Staff took care to introduce to us the dishes. Unfortunately, the didn't entirely wow us as the items weren't too special. Felt that the food was slightly under-seasoned. In general, the dishes served are similar to what you'd get in any restaurant (doesn't particularly spell Italian) and for us, lacks flavour. So while waiting for the dishes to be served, we had a look round the wonderful wine bottle display which also had price tags on. One thing to note when restaurants have lots of wood elements and open shelves - it's good to clean them every so often to avoid cob webs and dust from forming. Plastic bottles for bottles should also be scrubbed. All in, if we were seated away from the display and didn't ask for a bottle of water, we would have rated the place higher. That and the lack of seasoning in the food brought our ratings on them a tad down. We'll be back but will probably check out the rest of the restaurants in the neighborhood before returning.
5
Me and my girlfriend found this place via trip advisor while in Singapore, it's a cheap taxi ride (grab/uber) out at around 20sgd but I can not recommend this place enough. The food and staff were brilliant and their attention to detail and service was second to none. Unless you are going for Michelin service you will not find better and the food is wonderful and tailored to you personally
4
no need to worry about what dishes to choose when you get tasting portion of seafood & meat assortment. each serving was delicious in its own way! the chef and serving staff paid so much individual attention that it was flattering!
5
Top quality dishes, full of savours and expertly introduced by waiters who are also the chefs.
An excellent choice for those wanting great food and ambience without fuss.
5
A great out of town restaurant with excellent service. Worth a visit to experience the tasting menu. Lovely bars nearby to make an evening of it.
5
Planned my bf's birthday with Chomel and she's absolutely wonderful. All the dishes were awesome plus excellent service. Cozy ambience and good selection of wine. Definitely a place I will visit again.
5
We were a group of 6 and one of us arrived very late. However the table team led by a professional, pleasant and smiling young lady made us feel comfortable while waiting for our friend, never setting any pressure to start the dinner. Food was very good from start to end with a particular attention to what people don't like or can't eat. We also had some nice wine. All in all a very pleasant experience in a warm and relaxed environment. This is a great place with a great team serving very tasty food to a decent price. We will be back for sure 
3
I was first timer venturing into an exclusive suburban dining experience @ greenwood. It a omakaze Italian style. More like eating a huge Italian buffet embellished by foreign Italian names from an exotic land far far away. The food was average, the service was good but too much talking about food without a plastic non personal feel. For the decor and the food quality, the price was obviously too high. It was something new for Friday but will not go back there again.
5
Well, I didn't know upfront how much the dinner is going to cost, but the service and the taste of the meat suggested us that it was going to be quite a bit. After everything was over, and we had a very good dinner, we were quite pleased with the total bill. A reasonable price to pay for such a good evening.
5
We were welcomed cheerfully by the young owner Chomel and shown to our table immediately. We were ready to be surprised by the degustation menu of the night. We had 4 cold starters (salmon, lobster salad, mussels and beef) followed by 5 hot dishes (beef cheek, fish, lamb, foie gras and pasta of choice). Then had 4 dessert (panna cotta, tiramisu, chocolate cookie, Apple tart). We were stuffed at the end.My favourites were the salmon, lobster salad, beef cheek, foie gras and the truffle pasta. The chocolate cookie was superb!All in all, a symphony of well orchestrated dishes that pleases the palate. We will be back
5
We went after reading all the fantastic reviews on TA and we are certainly not disappointed! Though the restaurant is not centrally located, the food definitely made up for it. There was no menu; the whole meal consisted of around 12-13 dishes; all were wonderfully cooked and presented. You will definitely come out of the restaurant with a full stomach
5
There is no menu at this place, so it's fun to experience something different and put your taste buds in the hands of the fabulous chef. They do ask if there's anything you don't like, and were happy to make something different for those of us who needed it. The food was delicious, and the environment very relaxed. It's a taxi ride out if you're staying in central Singapore, but I would definitely recommend a trip out here if you have time.
5
Delicious food seasoned to perfection and friendly staff! Loved the no menu concept of the restaurant as well. Very versatile as any special requests can be made. A must-try!
5
Cosy atmosphere, personal one on one service, and spectacular food. Chomel Yang is a very highly gifted cook, and an evening here with friends or your significant other is highly recommended.

Average everything:
meal

quality

Pretending to be cool, but not worth the money spent.
5
It was our third visit and still surprising, delicious and extra.
Very comfortable and easy as you don't need to read the menu neither have to make decisions 😊.

Went there because they had won a TA award. Food is OK, but does not warrant an award. Consisted of a few appetizers followed a pasta dish n dessert.
5
It was the last night in Singapore for my boss turned great friend. It was easy to pick Fratini's for his farewell dinner. The food was fabulous and we enjoyed every dish. In total there were 13 or 14 (I lost count) cold and hot appetisers, pasta (we picked truffle ravioli which was great!) and desserts. We opted for wine pairing and it was a great choice. The excellent service from the table hosts you read so much on TripAdvisor reviews is all true. The very bubbly Chomel took time to explain each dish to us and surprised us with two glasses of Limoncello when she knew it was my boss' flight back to Europe the next day. Thank you Chomel and team at Fratini's for a delightful dinner and memorable evening.
4
S$350 for two people for the degaustation and one bottle of wine. Yes, a bit of bill shock. Don't get me wrong. The food was good. I'm not going to say it was all brilliant, it wasn't. But the degaustation was good. When you cook exactly the same meal for everyone it does feel a bit conveyor-belt-esque. I was a bit surprised they did not have and hot salami for the final pasta meal (own choice) but they did a good job making it on the fly. Anyway, not convinced it was worth the price but Singapore is expensive.
5
We brought foreign friends from overseas for dinner and were given TOP notch service by chomel and team. The wine list was extensive. Finally when the entire party came, every dish was superb. And it just seemed to get better and better with each new serving. It didn't seem to stop either! The excellent caramelised fried foie gras, the melt in your mouth beef cheek and the truffle pasta (2 types)... Our greatest regret was we were unable to finish the huge portions of pasta. It's my second visit there, and this time was better the last! Obviously we all had a fantastic night and no one was disappointed
4
I loved this restaurant. The chef was nice enough to talk to us for a while and, as costumers, we felt good about that. Every dish served was amazing! The service was fantastic!! I loved everything about this place including the ambiance and the location. It's a great place for a romantic night or a quite lunch
4
You need to reserve your seats in advance by at least 3-4 days at this very happening restaurant. We are a vegetarian family and we informed this during reservations itself. The Chef made it a point to serve everything vegetarian and egg free. Our dessert and pasta were also egg free. We were served about 8 starters and then pasta and 4 small desserts. The real attraction to this restaurant is that it has NO MENU. We are served lovely master Chef inspired menus by the Chef himself. The restaurant is pricey as you would expect for any such concept
4
The staff were so friendly and fun, but the food failed to amaze. It wasn't bad, but I guess we expected more. Good selection of wines though!
5
Was pleasantly surprised by the great food and the effort taken by Chomel Yang to explain each dish. Looking forward to my next visit!
5
Lovely ambiance, scrumptious food, amazing pizza, pasta and wine. We really enjoyed our meal at this place if your looking for authentic italian style food i highly rec. this place, and pizza is handmade lovely crust yummy flavor. Wine is lovely, pasta is omg flavorful. Definetly will go again here
4
My hubby surprised me by booking a table here.The location is apt located next to the museum and the striking part is they customise dishes.Loved the Riviolli n Tiramisu. If you are not tasting the riviolli n tiramisu here u r def missing out.The ambience is nice ,you can also visit with a bunch of friends.Overall avert satisfying experience and their wine selection is also goo
5
Visited here for our 1st wedding anniversary and really enjoyed it. The food was varied and very tasty, the wine was good and the staff very friendly and helpful. The beef ragu was exceptional and the beef cheek was melt in the mouth.Will happily go back nxt time we are in the neighbourhood.

Chomel runs this eatery at Greenwood which is off the beaten path. The nearest MRT station is Tan Kah Kee station (DT8) on the Downtown line. Grab a can instead to Greenwood.There is no menu at Fratini La Trattoria. You are treated to an Omakase style rustic Italian meal- whatever the Chef decides to cook that day. You get a tasting of 7-10 items - vegetables, seafood, meat, pasta and dessert. We got to taste a variety of dishes and most were excellently executed. The foie gras we had was seared perfectly - leaving it with a slightly crispy exterior but melty-creamy inside. The truffle pasta was sublime! We were served chicken, beef, fish, and bamboo clams. You can also 'make your own pasta' if you tell Chomel what you'd like in your pasta.Chomel patiently explains each dish as it is served at your table so you get an idea of the inspiration of the dish.Lunch starts from S$45++ and dinner S$90++
5
Went to a quietish Friday afternoon. Very impressed by the "not-so-small plates" of great ingredients served family style. There is no menu - just what the chef has on hand. But be prepared for good service and great cooking. The Italian beef with asparagus and potatoes, with just a side sprinkle of sea salt wowed us. The truffle pasta - sorry the pictures do not do it justice - divine.A word also about service - often under appreciated. Unobtrusive but affable. Shout out to Chomel who walked us through each dish and many things after ... Sublime
5
As you will see from other reviews, there really is no menu!This suited us down to the ground, especially as we love tasting all sorts of different foods, and if the chef can surprise us, all the better!The food was fantastic, although we started to run out of steam as there was almost too much of it. We had a total of ten courses/tasters, all of them different, and of them absolutely delicious.The staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming - they kindly ask if there is anything you can't or don't eat, not that it was a problem for us!Booking is recommended, and this is a short taxi ride out if the centre, but all of it well worth the visit
5
Brought my husband here for his birthday and we had a truly lovely night. They make an effort to share some information about each dish and where it's from, and that makes you appreciate what you're eating more, and also adds to the experience and taste of the food. There was a delectable selection of poultry and seafood too, and I like that they took note of when we finished a dish so they could serve the next quickly. The truffle pasta was just divine and the clear star of the night. I foresee future cravings and dreams about the glorious truffle pasta! Best I've ever had in my life. Oh and the people there are so warm and friendly too, with a great sense of humour! Also, the prices are really affordable (S$90 per person) considering the fresh and fine quality of the cuisines and the number of dishes we were served (12 in total I think, we lost count because we were entering a food coma). We'll definitely be back! I would suggest you make a reservation to avoid disappointment, and be prepared to spend 2-3 hours there.
5
I had lunch with a friend & we had no idea there was no menu. So lunch started with a surprise & we were served amazing food, one after the other. Service was excellent too. Very warm & attentive staff. I would definitely return & hope to be surprised again
5
Loved our visit to fratini la trattoria. So welcoming and the food was amazing!!
Both owners have done a great job at building a successful, different restaurant.
First stop when we next visit Singapore.
4
Interesting restaurant with no menu, but the food is nice and there is also a good selection of quality wines to choose from. More importantly, not over-priced.
4
I have heard great things about this restaurant and decided to come and try, surely the expectations were high and I would say all in all I was satisfied ... decent food good wine good concept...
4
$90 bucks a pop... Good try at being a No Menu Italian restaurant !14 courses... Actually 14 sets of dishes including starters . Vegetarian and Vegan friendly . They make a great effort . The starters were good but Pasta....aaah... Nothing spectacular . Be really hungry when you go and have leisurely 2 - 3 hours . Worth a try ...pretty good but not the bestest to be rated as no. 1 in Singapore. They try too hard I think and that looks a bit non spontaneous 
5
We were two persons with a some allergies/intolerances/food preferences, and the chiefs manage to handle this very good. We booked a table (really a recommendation since it became crowded fast) and prepared them on some of the food preferances (glutenfree, nutfree and vegetarian). When we arrived the staff had fully control over these preferences and we felt very good taking care of. We even got glutenfree pasta! So awesome. And halloumi.We sat outside, and though close to a not-so-trafficed road it was very cosy.Just be prepared for the price (count with more than S$900 for one person), but we thought it was worth it
3
We went to this restaurant based on the high reviews on trip advisor. The service was good and the food was nice however not worth the expensive price. We paid $320 for the two of us with one bottle of their lower prices wines
5
The people never get it wrong and so too it seems with tripadvisor's current no 1 rating here. At $90ph plus drinks (wine only $15 per glass) a great value night out of great dining. Pretty easy to get to via train and then an easy 800 metre walk through the suburbs (although I do confess to a taxi ride back to the hotel after dinner). Not much else I can add to the existing reviews other than to say that the truffle pasta was to die for. Highly recommended
5
My wife and I have had the pleasure of eating at a number of great eateries in Singapore over the past couple of days, but Fratini La Trattoria was by far the best and this was certainly worth the short MRT journey from central Singapore.The service was fantasic even before we arrived as our reservation and dietary requirements were all confirmed via an online free messenger as opposed to a phone call as the owners realised this would cost us a lot to receive. We received a warm welcome from co-owners Chomal and Jan who explained the no menu system. They then talked to us about what we like and dislike when it comes to food and Jan gave us a great wine recommendation. The bespoke appetisers came shortly thereafter and were both delicious and very well presented. Chomal not only explained how each appetiser was constructed but explained from which part of Italy they originated. She was very knowledgeable and passionate about the food she was serving.The following courses of meat, pasta and dessert were incredible. The quality and freshness of the food was clear and every dish was served with a detailed explanation and friendly service. This was simply the best Italian food we have eaten outside of Italy.Chomal & Jan were so warm and personable it felt like eating in a friend's kitchen. They have clearly worked hard to create a great experience for their customers and they thoroughly deserve the top spot on TripAdvisor.We cannot wait to come back, and I'm sure this restaurant will soon get the recognition it deserves
5
We took a leap of faith based off the good reviews on Trip Advisor and had a wonderful evening. They accommodated someone in our group who is gluten free and another pregnant without any fuss. The variety and quality of food was delightful and my favorite part was the service. The owners served us personally, provided detailed explanations of the wine and food and had great senses of humor. We will be back!
4
The restaurant has no menu but the chef is there for nearly every step of your meal so you can easily tell them what you do/don't prefer. The chef was very attentive to our needs and very friendly, always eager to make our meal more worthwhile.All the courses were quite delicious - with the exception of our pasta. We had seen amazing reviews of the seafood pasta and though it did look everything like we'd seen but the taste.. Well, we've had better pasta at many other restaurants so this was a little bit disappointing as we were very much looking forward to this dish of the night. For starters, the taste wasn't very memorable.. The tomato cream sauce lacked flavour to it although the other dishes we had before the pasta were so tasty! Additionally, the al dente of the pasta was not to our liking as we thought the pasta had been a bit overcooked, a little too soft. Also, the serving for the pasta is not a lot so be sure to ask for more if you're still up for more!Generally, a good place to go for celebrations and special event dinners. Getting there is a pain if you don't have a car though
5
We just have a birthday party at Fratini La Trattoria with 40 of us. The food and experience at the restaurant was great. Only wish the restaurant could be bigger so that we can held bigger party there.
5
Good was authentic; with interesting twist but nothing pretentious or compromising the original flavor of the fresh ingredients. Service was superb too.
5
Was extremely fortunate to find this place during a too-brief business trip to Singapore. I love the no-menu concept, and the cooking and wines were outstanding. Chef Yang was a delightful host and is clearly passionate about her work. Will absolutely return next time I'm in Singapore.
4
Own by a young lady owner who passioned about food. Visited there with business associates. You just need to tell her what you don't eat and she will decide the menu for you. Food came with surprises and very tasty especially the truffle cooked pasta that I remembered that must try! As o don't eat beef but my colleague claimed the best beef that he tried so far! Good varieties of Italian grappa! Close on Monday, do make reservation in advance.
5
This might actually be the best restaurant we have ever been to. The food is out of this world delicious! It's a no menu concept, you just tell them what you like and what you don't, sit back and enjoy this amazing 10-14 dishes! To add to the experience the owners/chefs are a wonderful young couple that introduce every dish with so much passion! Cannot wait to go back! They are number 1 for a reason!!
5
Last week my wife and me had dinner in Fratini for our 25 year wedding anniversary.From the welcome at the door, to the last spoon of dessert everything was perfect.The variety of food accompanied by the best wines is a really surprising.And last but not least I have never seen such a motivated staff taking care of their customers.We will be back soo
5
Honestly, was surprised when Chomel introduced herself, 1st as the waitress, then the chef, & last but not least, the joint owner. Not the stereotypical Italian restaurant at all. I recall my US boss raising his eyebrow a bit. I had promised him a great meal before he left.No menu. Another interesting touch. we ate what was served. 14 dished in all. & most (Beef, seafood) were absolutely top notch. We had a fastidious Italian in our party who verified it's authenticity. Overall, Fabulous service, Fabulous food.Thanks Jan & Chomel for a wonderful time. See you soon
4
Had a great company dinner and the food are awesome especially the truffle pasta! Most importantly we have don't have to decide what to eat cause they have No Menu and service was exceptional . Will be back for sure
5
This restaurant serves a set menu type service with a varied assortment of dishes from different regions in Italy. Initially my group was a bit worried it would be more of a gimmicky type establishment but were pleasantly surprised that everything was authentic and delicious. The service is friendly, efficient and informative and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual Italian service in most restaurants
4
No menu. You eat what you negotiate. Chef comes and asks for your preference and allergies and suggests what he thinks is good today. Great if you go before the crowd arrives but a little hectic after.Generally competently cooked food at reasonable prices. Good, but I wouldn't vote them the best in Singapore
5
Amazingly delicious and good value. I would return again and again and again. Recommended to my friends to try. Service was awesome. The young waitress was very pleasant and smiley. In short awesome.
5
Best! Tender and juicy and the staff are friendly. Difficult to find but gps gets you there.
Go for the 1kg steak!
Cramp but very local! I guess weather places a big part
5
I loved their pasta seafood (Similar to local Fried Hokkien Noodle ) Good food, nice ambient, and excellent service from the owner.
5
It was an amazing dining experience. Unbelievable food with all the surprises, service was impeccable and staff was friendly. No choice in menu is the best option. This is one of the best and we will definitely be coming back soon.
5
Had a truly amazing dinner from 7pm to 11pm. Everything was perfect for our anniversary celebration two days ago and I will bring my family back again tomorrow. Can't speak higher on the tastes, service and environment.

I had to write this review because, as an italian who's lived in Singapore for 7 years, I'm tired of being ripped off every time I go out to eat Italian.I won't waste time talking about each of the 7 or 8 courses on the menu - not worth it. I'll just summarise:- The food was overall completely bland: no salt, no spice, no taste at all- The items on the menu were just a variation of the same 4-5 ingredients: cherry tomatoes, broccolini, mushroom etc. just cooked in different ways...so boring- Not authentic at all: as an Italian, I can tell you. Even the ingredients used were very substandard: cheap olive oil, tasteless tomatoes, very cheap cheese, bad wine. Now, I can "accept" that if I'm having a set menu lunch on a week day in a cheap restaurant. But if I'm paying $300 for a 2 persons dinner, no! I think that's ridiculous.- The service wasn't terrible but wasn't good either: we asked for salt/pepper for our pasta (as it was completely tasteless) and had to wait forever to get it. Had to ask twice and were told they were "being prepared" - how long does it take to "prepare" salt & pepper?? By the time we got it the pasta was cold.

Fantastic food prepared by Chomel and Monica, including a truffled pasta which set a new a new benchmark, great service - the best we've seen really- and a really interesting concept with no menu. We had a great night. My advice for potential patrons .... get in quick so you will be able to claim you discovered Fratini before Michelin whacks a star or two on the door. It's that good

I will not describe in detail my dining experience in Fratini. But suffice it to say that everything is excellent from antipasti to dolce. Was trying to make up my mind where to have dinner to celebrate my son's 22nd birthday and I decided to have it here for three reasons: (1) i was attracted to the write up that Fratini does not have any menu and you just have to entrust your gustatory delight to the chef; (2) i want something very special for my son; and (3) we just came from Italy last December 2015 and i sort of missed the Italian fare. Though this is far from the city proper (like Orchard) and therefore we have to take a cab from our hotel, every distance traveled was worth it. Dinner was superb. Service is personal (the Filipino waiter always saw to it that we were ok, and the owners too and the rest of the gang). They all explained what the dish is all about, which Italian region did it originate from, etc. Overall, this is one of my best dining experiences I've had by far. Will still go back to Fratini next time I get to Singapore

A group of 4 of us had dinner here, which spontaneously became 6midway through the meal. The staff handled the change seamlessly, and with good humour. The food was excellent, and undoubtedly one of the best meals I've had out in Singapore. But the service, from not just attentive but bubbly and friendly staff makes it a complete stand out. The bill was fair, and the wine excellent. The decor is fresh and charming. A must return
5
Absolutely excellent restaurant and staff, no menu but you will be asked about any likes/dislikes. Several sublime dishes ensued that bested anything I have ever experienced anywhere. Staff are excellent, knowledgable and discrete. Their promise is this you will not be served the same food again as they keep your number and details of what you have been served. My best dining experience in Singapore bar none. Book at least 1 week in advance though as there are not a lot of tables and it is full every day. The icing on the cake is that all this comes at a very moderate price making it a must do 
5
Wonderful food, fabulous service, lovely atmosphere. Planning to return on our next visit to Singapore. I loved the explanations of the origin of the dishes and their ingredients. Every course was superb - four cold appetisers, four hot appetisers, pasta main course and three desserts. We were very full by the end of the meal, even though each course was small and perfectly formed. They were very happy to tailor the meal to special dietary requirements and food preferences
5
We were not sure what to expect when the restaurant said no menu .... but it turned out to be the best meal we have ever had from start to finish . The staff were excellent, the food was delicious and overall it was one of the best ways we could have spent our last night in Singapore and my Sister's birthday 
5
I don't say this easily but the food here astounded me. I went with already high expectations but it beat those expectations by a huge margin. The wine list is extensive (no idea about quality of wines on the list). The service is a good balance of being helpful while giving u privacy.Overall, it deserves to be the best rated restaurant in singapore. Go with high expectations and watch as they beat those expectations
5
It is not a surprise that this restaurant is number 1 in trip advisor, the quality of Service and food is out of the world , the staff is confident what they are doing and chef are at there best when it comes to food . Great meal ,little expensive but for this kind of experience money doesn't matter .

We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and had a wonderful time. I enjoyed what the chefs had in store for us, and the service was excellent. It's essentially "italian omakase", with the chefs tailoring the dishes according to your preferences/dietary requirements. Service was not just friendly but so knowledgeable, and responsive while not being intrusive on our date night ;)Food was delicious. It manages to find the sweet spot between fine dining to be exquisite and offer a variety over its 7-10 course dinner, while being unpretentious. I'd say all dishes served are comfortably a 7 and above upon 10. (Calibrating it to Singapore standards, it'd be 8 and above.) The broth and texture of the pasta is the best I've had in Singapore, and I've had a lot of pasta. The flavours were delightful. The wine.....what an amazing selection, and fantastic recommendations. It's a place we'll be delighted to be back again. We were here as a couple, but also saw families and friends having a great time. Like the food, the atmosphere and company was classy yet unpretentious. Excellent value for money

The specialty of this restaurant is there's no menu and chef will recommend according to your dietary and what you doesn't like to eat. Every course was good until the dessert. I personally like the pandan pudding because it smells so nice. The baked crayfish with butter was really good as the seafood itself was really fresh. We ordered pesto pasta with chicken as our main course and it turned out good as what we want. The overall ambience and food tasting was great. Would recommend to those who love to try Italian fusion meal.
5
So its an italian restaurant right and so i was trying to peek and see the handsome chef ..hah was i wrong!. This restaurant is front by a very talented chef, its unpretentious and is honest to goodness genuine love of good quality food. The folks here makes you feel like you are dinning at a friend's place. Best of all the restaurant can cater to all your dietary needs and can whip up a storm on the spot! The host takes the trouble to explain the dishes, what's in it, where its origin etc .. and would be happy to explain further to an inquisitive person like me. Go for the dinner then you get more dishes compared to the lunch. The best dish? hard to say, they were all beautiful, but truffle person, i would say the pasta truffle. Wont tell you about the others, go surprise yourself... And as Arnold would say "I'll be back"

We have been coming to this Fratini La Trattoria for many times for the past couple of years. We had met Chef Gabriel Fratini and his wife many times. He was friendly and made us feel like we were a guest at his house. That was one of the reason we had been coming back and recommended our friends to come. Until this last visit we realized that the resturant has been sold to a new owner however the concept of the resturant - no menu and the ambiance were the same.  One significant change I would have to say is food. Even though the plate setting was the same but food is a bit more decorated and more varieties than before. The dishes were flavorful and filling which was always surprised me as most of the dishes were served in bite-size. One of the thing I missed was panna cotta. The one served this time around was panda panna cotta which was not bad but I was looking forward to the original. Another change which was good was the fact that you could choose your pasta or you could opts out for a surprise. And if you don't dismiss your food, you could take it home to enjoy later. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We missed the connection to the originator but somehow the changes didn't make the meal any less memorable.
5
We finally made it to La Trattoria and we did not regret it a second. Hard core Italy fans and travellers as we are, we were not sure whether we would be disappointed - we were not.The dishes are varied and each has a relation to a region in Italy all very insightful presented by the staff, who btw gave us a real treat as if we were the most important guests ever.As always in Singapore the wine prices are out of this world, however the mark up on the price is really ok here.Just a very nice evening and a place you will visit again and again. Especially because they promise that they will never serve yuo the same dishes twice

Fratini La Trattoria used to be ranked number 1 in tripadvisor and I was curious. I thought for an Italian restaurant to be ranked number 1 in Singapore then it must be very good. However, after my husband and I had dinner there, we both thought that the food is very bland. For people who are used to the complex flavours of Asian food, the food here is not exciting at all. I just came back from Rome last week and had lunch in good restaurants there, and then I realized that Italian food can be really good. However the Italian food in Fratini is only average in comparison. Service is very good. However there is no menu and no prices so if you are on a budget, better don't dine here. We spent over SGD 200 for 2 set dinners. There is a lot of food but the taste is not fantastic
5
Nice & friendly environment. Kind of romantic place. Foods are amazing especially the ossobuco. Not to forget the tiramisu as dessert. Yummy! Yummy!
5
We went here on Wed night for our 25th anniversary. No menu seems a bit scary but the team here will look after you and cater to your likes. We had the 7 course degustation menu and it was brilliant all the way through.It took on on a journey through Italy and it was beautiful Can highly recommend this place, it's in a residential area and only a $25 taxi from the city. Thanks for making it so special. Enjoy. Stuart and Lorraine.
5
We went with friends to celebrate a big birthday, and Fratini La Trattoria was the perfect place!Whilst we had read the reviews, the food and service surpassed our expectations with the Chef coming to our table, asking our preferences and taking the time to explain the meals an absolute delight. Food was beautiful (particularly the pasta) and some of the best service we have experienced in Singapore
5
We visited this restaurant for a mid week lunch treat and gosh, we were impressed. Situated among a row of restaurants in a residential area, it is certainly tough to stand out let alone find a steady stream of crowd. But this homely restaurant found its key by offering convivial service and impressive food creations. For lunch, we were treated to a selection of appetisers, meats, seafood and pasta. Embodying a 'no menu' concept, every dish gave us a happy surprise. Throughout the experience, our senses were teased with a medley of flavours and textures. A highlight would be the pasta as it was cooked 'al dente' - a rare find in this part of the world. Being true to its roots and complemented by warm service, this place is a must-visit for those seeking a homely and comforting Italian dining experience

Went to this fine Italian Restaurant with 2 of my good friends for lunch. The ambience was good with soothing background music.Our visit today was extravagant, there is no menu but one of the Business Partner Januver personally asked our preference and these are some of the few we highly recommended:Will definitely come back again with more friends
5
My family had lunch at Fratini recently. It was our second visit and both times were as satisfying. The lunch was 6-course, starting with an assortment of appetisers, then followed by crayfish, lamb, chicken, choice of pasta and dessert platter. We had indicated a "no beef" selection. Our children (age 5 and 7) had a pasta and ice cream combo. When we were there, there was a promotion where 1 child eats free for 2 dining adults. Service was attentive and friendly throughout the meal. We will definitely be visiting again
5
My second visit to this little gem nestled in the residential and restaurant enclave of Greenwood Ave. The place just screams homeliness, from the decor, to the lovely couple managing the place, to the chef and cooking staff, and obviously to the food. On my previous first visit, albeit with someone who had come before, I felt the warmth of a family inviting you to their home for dinner. On this visit, I felt I had married into the family. There is no menu here, just like you would not ask your host family what is being served, only tell them what you cannot eat and also what you like (before coming if possible), and let the, feed you well.Starting large sharing plates with mix of small mouths of seafood and meat as starters, we were off to a good start. They tend to change this up frequently and my 2 visits in 2 months yielded 7-8 different little bites, maybe with some repeat of main ingredients but different flavours.Followed that up with a flood of meats and fishes, where I think the strength of Fratini really lies. Coming stewed, grilled, braised and pan fried, we got to tasted through different parts of Italy as the regional cooking techniques of their favourite cuts were replicated by the chef team. A selection of pastas with regularly available sauces and cooking styles was proposed, together with some specials for the day. Be careful not to order too much, they tend to be fairly large, but I wouldn't skip them as well. Deserts were little variations of familiar favourites, in small tasting portions luckily as by now if you are not stuffed, you can never be full.Each of the dishes was introduced to us lovingly, and proudly, like you would for your family's secret recipe.If I had one complain, it would be that there was way too much food. So pace yourself and enjoy
5
Can't say enough how fantastic this place is. It was interactive with much personal touches from the moment we stepped in. The Head Chef - Ms Chomel Yang - made the whole dining experience very delightful as she walked us through the origins of various ingredients used and how each dish was prepared. There is no menu here, but go ahead to trust the five chefs to give you your best meal of week, if not month. It's that good. If you are going for the first time, ask for the truffle pasta (yes, you can request for this one). Very flavourful! Am also told the restaurant will customize the meal to the group size. The ultimate personal touch is in making sure you have a different set of cuisine, as they have a new menu every few days. I'm definitely coming back for another great dining experience
4
Overall we had an enjoyable experience however some items brought out were nothing to shout about. I don't think this is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore (which it is voted as currently). Interior of the restaurant is actually rather dirty and looking a bit tired which does not add to the overall experience
5
The Ambience is really great and we was greeted by 2 friendly waiters. The head chef even welcomed us. We liked the place so much, the wait staff are friendly and food is really fantastic! What is so special about this place is, there is no menu! The head chef will personally custom food to your liking. This is something which you cannot get in other restaurants. And be prepared for the wonderful surprises and treats that awaits you. This is NO DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANT in Singapore! My overseas friends loved the entrÃ¨ and appetisers. A must try restaurant
5
Came back again and this time brought my family along to celebrate Fathers' Day. We had strong impression on marinated mackerel, lamb shank and pandan panna cotta. It was so good! Had a great family gathering!
5
Second time here. Both times super tasty food and great service. Just need to make sure and bring your appetite as it is a lot of food!
4
A bit pricey though. Nice decoration, a bit far from the main districts but it is worth to try. Better to go there with a group of 4 or more because it is a 14 courses dinner, offcourse tiny potions of each courses
4
good value for quality food and drinkFratinni only serves a fixed menu that is determined by whats available in the marketOur meal comprised of - cold starter - salmon, scallop, seared beef fillet- mains - foie gras, beef cheeks, sea bass- pasta course - we opted for seafood linguini- dessert - tiramisu & panacotaThe italian chefs unfortunately were not around that day, otherwise the dishes may have been a little better prepare
5
A return visit again with a group of friends. Having heard raving reviews, my friends were definitely not disappointed with the food and service that night! Highly recommend the Ossobuco and Lamb Shank dishes, they were flavorful and well cooked. Wine pairing was well recommended by them, and complimented our dining experience. Highly recommend this restaurant for a great dining experience and will be back again
5
People are starting to talk about this hidden gem with only top things to say. We had the opportunity to taste the food last night. Everything we heard was true. The food is stunning, perfectly balanced mixture of tastes and textures. In particular I loved the starting dish, scallops, mussels, salmon etc. The staff also are faultless, knowledgeable and personable. They have obviously been employed for their love of food, wine and customers. They are full of they right mix of personality, humour and understand also when to leave you alone. Staff would receive 10/10 Food 10/1
5
Had the most satisfying omakase experience with my loved one at this wonderfully managed restaurant. Began the culinary experience with the cold appetizer dish comprises of 4 varieties and each brought me near to tears on the wonderful texture and flavours. Next, the warm appetizer comprising of seabass let me tasted the freshness of the sea. The main dish is pasta and frankly speaking, I can't believe so much sauce was absorbed by the pasta, making it so much tastier even just by chewing pasta alone. The desserts didn't fail and the rich chocolate with strawberry sauce ended my wonderful trip to this wonderland. 2 thumbs up
5
We made reservations for dinner for our last evening together in Singapore. We wanted to try the restaurant previously but they were fully booked in March. It's a little out of reach from the city but without a shred of doubt, I can say the trip is worth it. The No Menu concept is probably the most interesting aspect of the restaurant. Right from the beginning, the staff were courteous, engaging, and attentive. We both conveyed our preferences and they presented an amazing six course dinner. The chef personally introduced herself and presented almost every course. Chef Monica was absolutely lovely and very warm to us, and made the dining experience all the more better. As for the food itself, we devoured almost course, I don't remember the last time I wanted the recipes for so many of the dishes we tried. Thank you so much to all the servers from last night who provided excellent service and especially Chef Monica who was kind enough to even present us an additional surprise dessert, making her the highlight of our evening. I would love to return and would definitely recommend Fratini La Trattoria
2
Been there with family and friends. What a disappointment! I get so upset when I bump into those places, pretending to provide authentic Italian ingredients and recepies a data high price! Ingredients are the cheapest on the market - then not from Italy - and tastes are blunt. No flavours of fresh herbs and spices - just all the same flat blunt nonsense. Theorists with beef meet only taste of stock. The tiramisu tastes of nothing, not even coffee. Nope, not a good Italian at all
5
I was back at Fratini again. This time with with my siblings for dinner and we were glad to have made an early reservation as restaurant was fully booked for the evening.Despite being packed, we were served by very attentive and friendly staff. Around 12 to 14 items (kinda of lost count) were served and we enjoyed the consistent quality of food. Food presentation was also great and served at very good pace. Ambience was cosy and we enjoyed the dinner tremendously. We particularly enjoyed all the appetisers. Lamb shank and foie gras terrine were some of the highlights. Creme brûlée was also fantastic and we ended the evening with a good cup of coffee.Would be back again!
5
Wonderfull!!it was v nice and relaxing experience .They made us feel a special guest and we were enjoying their creativity one after another...very different and delicious...
5
The food was just great, from the cold tapas to the lamb, the crayfish or the truffle pasta. We let the staff recommend a bottle of wine and these guys definitely know their wines, we got a 100% Cabernet Franc that was just amazing! And the service was excellent, professional and very friendly at the same time. I'll be back soon for sure
5
We went to this quiet little place for a date night dinner. All I knew was that its Italian cuisine. But was amazed at their concept. This is a no menu restaurant. From the moment we were seated we were treated like guests and not like customers. I am a vegetarian and so have a limit of choices at any place. But not here.Chomel and her team laid out an extensive course of meals. All they asked me is what I preferred in veggies. To my amazement, this is the only italian place I have been to that didn't serve any bread. Yet they managed to give us a superb variety of delicious dishes.The entire team is very cordial and pay attention to detail. All in all a marvellous experience and I hope to eat there soon again
5
I had been to this restaurant when it first opened around 2013/2014. It was a fantastic experience then, and it was a fantastic experience this time around. I went there with 2 close friends and my wife. We all agreed on one thing at the end of the day - this was one of the best experiences we have had in a restaurant in Singapore. The food - from the range of appetizers, to the main course, to the dessert was uniformly great. What made everything so special was the treatment we received from the staff - we were pampered throughout and were made to feel really special.The idea of 'no-menu', with a fantastic 'surprise' spread and hosts who took so much care for us, made this one of the best experiences we have had at any place in Singapore and the region. If you want a really special, happy dinner which you will not soon forget, this is the place to go
5
From the moment you enter, the staff could not be more charming. They set a lovely ambience of relaxed fun in which to enjoy our mealTheir wine cellar offered additional choices to the wine list and the Barolo we chose was excellentThe concept of menu free, multiple small courses was explained and then dining beganFood was overall very good, the truffle pasta delicious. We would advise not to eat lunch before going there to dine, very fillingWill definitely be returning agai
5
We visited here on a friend's recommendation, intrigued by the idea of no menu and a surprise as to what we would eat. The restaurant itself is lovely and the service was top notch from start to finish. The food was also great and had a nice variety. They query your likes and dislikes first to get a sense of your taste and any dietary preferences or restrictions. What fun to try a wide range of dishes. We look forward to our next visit
5
Visited Fratini on a Friday night after hearing great reviews. Upon entering, the staff and chefs immediately make you feel very welcome and take you through the "no menu" concept. We put ourselves completely in their hands and were richly rewarded! The smorgasbord of appetizers, were a superb start to the evening. Small bites but packed with flavor and quality ingredients; Mussels, Tuna Tartar/w Avocado; Fish/butternut purée; Beef/salad. Melt in the mouth beef cheeks, roasted Italian chicken, succulent lamb chops all followed....and then a delicious truffle pasta plate saved in the pan rounded off the savory extravaganza! This was all washed down with a great value organic Chianti which was part of a decent and affordable wine list (unusual for much of Singapore!). Desserts followed with Pannacotta, Creme Brûlée and Tiramisu.Overall a great culinary experience and fully complemented by great service. The staff were excellent.We will be returning
5
Firstly, the staff were very pleasant and friendly. They knew how to humor the customers and it was very entertaining to be served by them. Most knew what the food was made from and it was a delightful experience. The food was very tasteful. Don't eat lunch before coming. They serve in small portions but it will fill you. The cold appetizers were very exciting. The truffle pasta was really exquisite! The dessert was tantalizing. But if you're not looking for a lot of meat in your course, go for the seafood course. The chef tailors the meal to your preferences. Overall, if I were to rate out of 10, it would be a 9.5. Some of the tastes were a first for me and requires an acquired taste to fully appreciate
5
Had our dinner there on a weekend night! They have an interesting business concept, with high quality of the food served. I would recommend this place to hang out with friends and enjoy a good meal! They also serve really good desserts! Especially the slice of earl grey lavender cake we had! Give it a try when you are there
5
one of the best italian restaurants in singapore (I am italian and i have lived in this city for over 3 years). Great fish. There is no menu though: the chef will prepare every day based on the best ingredients he finds. So if you are uncomfortable with not being able to decide what to eat, then probably you shouldn't go there. For my part, I enjoy the surprise and have not been disappointed both times i went. The second time i was with a large group of 19 people and everyone was happy. Not the cheapest place, but considering what you get to eat, costs are reasonable
5
No wonder this restaurant has such a good reputation... the food is delightful from starters to dessert, everything was delicious. The service is very friendly.
5
The food was unique and it was an experience in itself dining at Fratini! Very friendly and warm staff which were accommodating to our needs. Great personalized dining experience right in the heart of Singapore! The desserts deserve a shout out!
5
The evening was a huge surprise and a super delicious dinner. There is no menue... every dish was amazing. Congratulatiins!
5
We had a great meal here for my husband's birthday. The food was delicious and the service was great too. The chef came to greet us and asked us about any food we couldn't eat or didn't like, as there is no menu so the food is a bit of a surprise. The first dish was a selection of cold appetisers, the scallop was my favourite, the swordfish my husband's favourite. then we moved on to hot food, a selection of seafood and meat including a melt in the mouth piece of steak, and then a pasta dish, ending with a selection of 3 desserts. We will be going back again very soon
5
I went to the restaurant on a weekday night and the ambience is really good. It's really chill and perfect for gatherings or even dates. I had the salmon tartare, truffle pasta and tiramisu. The salmon tartare is perfect. The mixture of ingredients were so well balanced and flavorful. I would recommend this if you are a fan of salmon sashimi! The second dish was the truffle pasta and I am a absolute fan of truffle! This mouth-watering dish is perfect. I couldn't have a for anything more to be honest. The last dish of the day is the tiramisu, and even though I am not really a fan of tiramisu but the tiramisu here made me think twice. The service here is great, the staff are really friendly and provide excellent service. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for somewhere with a nice ambience and excellent food! Cheers! :

We learned of Fratini through Trip Advisor during our vacation in Singapore. The reviews were outstanding, so we decided to give it a try. What a meal! Along with superbly designed and prepared courses, what made the evening for us was the attentiveness, pride and enthusiasm of the staff. One piece of advice for first-timers, it is a lot of food! Go there hungry or discuss with them up front the number and size of portions. They are more than happy to modify the selections for individual preferences. Overall, an outstanding experience I'd heartily recommend for foodies in Singapore. Although tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, transportation to/from the restaurant was easy
5
Fratini has the most impressive service ever. The co-owner, Jan, was very patient and knowledgeable about the food they serve! The 'no-menu' meant a no-headache dinner experience for us and we wiped our plates clean! Mad love the banana cake I think this place is perfect for a gathering of friends / family who enjoy good food with impeccable service.Can't wait to visit again!
5
The memories of the lunch was still fresh because it was so good and this time, when I have to find a place for dinner for my family and friends from Philippines, I said to myself " I SHALL RETURN"We started with 4 servings of starters, ranging from a Mediterranean fish called Hake, Beef Carpaccio, Foie Gras, and a chicken based starter. The small beautifully plated servings works well and fired up our appetiteThe second serving as an interesting dish of Southern Italian Roasted pigeon. Due to southern Italian being closer to Northern Africa, it is no wonder the taste is very middle eastern and even oriental. Very creative and exotic.Then next was a meat serving of baby lamb rack. This was cooked so very tenderly and with the aroma of the herbs that I need more than the normal serving....MORE PLEASEFinally, we were served with 3 different pans of pasta with 3 different favors; a truffle al fungi pasta, a fruitti di mare and another is the classical bolognese. Despite the fact that most of us were full, we could not resist to finish them all and some of us even asked for bread to wipe clean the sauce on the pan.When we think it is over, each one of us were presented with 4 servings of dessert. I recalled that there was a Tiramisu, a sausage look alike biscuit, a pinnacotta made from pandan flavoring. Finally, topping up with a nice macchiato, and a shot of limoncello. Ambrosia!!
5
My family of 6 thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Fratini over last weekend. For roughly the same amount per pax that we would have paid in other comparable restaurants, Fratini offered very good value with a sampling of 14 different types of food including 4 cold starters, 4 meats/fish, 1 pasta (split into 2 flavours) & 4 desserts. The meal was amongst the best we have eaten for Italian food and the high standard was pretty consistent across all the dishes (except for one) not only in taste, but presentation & creativity as well. Whilst we had to wait quite a while for our food to arrive as the restaurant was full, it turned out to be a fun, highly "anticipating" & enjoyable evening and the chef cum owner Chomel made a special effort to explain every dish to us including it's origin, ingredients & how it was cooked. To the team at Fratini, thanks for the wonderful experience & we will surely be back for more pleasant surprises!
5
We have been visiting Fratini's since Nov 2014. For any foodie, this no menu restaurant is a must try. You will not be disappointed. 2016 now see's new ownership, but the food experience has not changed, and the service is fabulous. Even with no menu, they cater to all requests. Congratulations to the team at Fratini for providing a wonderful dining experience
5
Excellent food with personal friendly service. Would be great if they have wine promotions for lunch :)
Prices for lunch are reasonable.
Will be back!
5
Everything about the service and food was top notch. Food presentation was super and taste was incredible. Simply amazing and would recommend this very highly.
5
An outstanding evening shared at Fratini LaTrattoria. There is no menu and you are surprised with the most delectable offerings from the kitchen. Our hostess for the evening Chomel, was a sheer delight. Not only was she exuberant but her knowledge of the food that was being served is to be complimented. She certainly added the extra edge to the evening. A must visit. Thank you Chomel. We'll see you again. Debbie Hawkins and Kay Marsh

After a few months of touring Singapore for a good restaurant, we decided it was time to visit Fratini. Me and my partner arrived with no expectations, as we had no idea what we were about to eat! We were asked about our dietary requirements and from there the magic started. Here dishes began to arrive, the blending of flavours what so perfect I felt I was back in Italy!  The intimacy of the environment really made this venue even more special. It has been difficult, for me, to find a restaurant that was not overcrowded or extremely loud.. especially in Singapore. And finally I have found one. The wine list was very well presented, the white wine section by the glass was not anything spectacular but that was my mistake for not opting red wine in an Italian restaurant.Finally, I completely disagree with the post below, because the post complains more about the restaurants lack of "fine dining" procedures. The aim of an Italian restaurant shouldn't be to be "fine dining" per se, because that would strip away the soul of Italian food. The experience should remain as a made at home, simple, rustic yet intimate experience followed by beautifully tasting food. And that is exactly what Fratini La Trattoria delivered. **Highly recommen
5
Outstanding restaurant in terms of food, plating, interior design, wine and service. I spent a very cozy night there with my boy friend. We've tried a dozen of other fine dining restaurants in Singapore but Fratini remains the top one for us. The owner is a young lady who managed to upgrade the old menu and instilled fresh ideas to the dishes. We adored the "no menu" idea, which made every dish a surprise. They also carry decent Italian wines with reasonable price, e.g. Barolo and Brunello. Definitely worth visiting

Very great food. The presentation and the taste of it is absolutely excellent. The personnel is very gentle and friendly and the new "Manager" is simply amazing. The ambience is cheerful and warm. The pasta and the fish are superb. It's a place I recommend to visit. It's a little touch of Italy abroad

Don't get me wrong this is a good restaurant worth visiting. Service is very friendly and good food. But this has been rated number 1 on Trip Advisor and therefore you expect something exceptionally special in terms of overall experience. My 'poor' rating is based on the expectation it was going to be number 1! Perhaps they had a bad night. We have been meaning to try Fratini for a long time (2 years) but it never happened until 2 weeks ago. I would consider myself a 'foodie' and have been accused of sometimes over-analysing all aspects of the experience - from the booking experience to the taxi booking at the end. In summary, the bits around the edges were fine, so let's get into the crux of it: There is no menu so they ask what type of food do you dislike or any allergies - the rest is decided by the chef. My wife explained her dislike of courgettes and seafood. After a little bit of (annoying) debate around prawns v crayfish, to move it along, we agreed on no fish for the wife and certainly no courgettes. My glass was empty after the first two courses and remained empty until the taxi arrived (I got bored asking). My wife's glass was empty for 30 minutes - she was less impressed as it was her wine glass! One of the main courses turned up on a bed of....courgettes!! Whilst admirable of the waitress to try to defend this and argue that it was maybe zucchini and not courgettes and "they are different" I think she missed the point! (Of course, zucchini & courgette are both from the cucurbit vegetable family, & taste and look very similar, but it wasn't about that or being 'right or wrong' it was about our experience and this was just a very irritating lack of basic attention to detail). The food was generally high quality flavours and preparation - the desert was sensational but overall a 'poor' experience based on the expectation level. We are glad we have tried it and ticked the box but that's it done. Personally, for a no menu format I found the restaurant "No Menu" more enjoyable and an overall better experience

Short review:- must have- truffles pasta & panna cottaLengthy review:- Being rated no 1 in trip advisor, I had the "let's see what we have here" mentality. Looking at the photos of past diners, yeah, not your run of the mill Italian restaurant, with quaint setting for "degustation" menu. Food from different parts of Italy and nice touch when the servers took time to tell us more (that shows so much about their joy and pride about the food that they can showcase).Wine list- fab- form $60-$600; we had one around $85 - good stuff.We love (loads) the truffles pasta and panna cotta. Out of this "world" (or should we say country?!). We are sure that we cannot get this quality even at TOP notch Italian restaurant. I'll be back!P.S. I asked whether I can do take away for that very two "Makans" (pasta & dessert), YES! they don't !!

My Husband and I wanted to try something different than what we find in the surrounding of Orchard road, saw review on trip advisor and decided to try, we went for lunch without expecting much, very simple but cozy deco, 3rd restaurant we've been with the no menu concept, just love the idea of not having the hassle to decide what to order. The chef came to ask us whether we had any food allergy or food constraint, then decide what he wants us to try, we had four appetizers (carpaccio platters, poached salmon, veal cheek, and a pan fried Foie gras with it figue purÃ©e), one main course, I have to say the best (truffle tagliatelle) pasta ever in Singapore, and a set of 3 mini dessert where I had the best pana cotta soft and creamy. Like so much their pasta that I've asked to buy their pasta which not only they brought to me, but gave it for free. When we got the bill we were very surprised to know how affordable it was. It sure worth every penny or even more.Highly recommend to anyone looking for a gastronomic experience
5
Superb dining experience - the variety is exquisite, and the service friendly and charming! We're on repeat visits, and each time the food has been truly excellent! Chomel and Jen provide impeccable service to go with the delicious dishes! Thank you! Highly recommended!!! R & 
5
Seriously, one of the best food experiences in the world ever. Every course amazed us, exquisite, surprising tastes. Service wise, unparalleled and fantastic. I can't speak highly enough, we will be back!
5
The deserts are really nice and we enjoyed the great service there too. You should try the earl grey lavender cake, that's my favorite. :)
5
We had a great meal at Fratini La Trattoria. A nice Italian experience in an amazing city like Singapore. High quality of food with a great service madeour meal just perfect. Will be back soon
1
How could this be no1?
Old fashion plating, sloppy with loads of things all over the plate.
No menu, not ok.
We will not go because of this. They just lost a company that would be happy to spend.
5
Went on Valentine's day and the experience was awesome! You let them know your dietary restrictions and they surprise you with nice good! Love their dessert experience that was planned thoughtfully. My boyfriend is a coffee fan and love their coffee over there! Wine recommendation was good too
5
Celebrated our cousin's birthday at Fratini and the service and food were wonderful! Highly recommend the Aglio Olio and Salmon with Tuna Sauce. Service was also prompt and attentive despite the dinner crowd on a Saturday night! Had a wonderful night together and will definitely be back for more :
5
Went there for my boyfriend's birthday and had a wonderful meal. The waiter for our table was attentive and enthusiastically recommended a couple of good pairing wines, which we really enjoyed.We had an 8 course meal that left us absolutely stuffed. Antipasti was delicious and innovative, such that we were unable to finish the huge pasta serving towards the end of the meal. Desserts were really good, I especially enjoyed the tiramisu, one of the best I've ever had! Overall price point is reasonable, will be back again for special nights. Pity they dont have a bring your own bottle policy. Just a note, those driving to Fratini will get free valet parking
4
Really love the no menu concept . Nice location to have dinner on a weekend as my date wanted someplace less crowded . She loved the 7-course dinner we had and especially the dessert . Special thanks to Chef for making it a great experience for the both of us 
5
Heard of awesome Italian food at Fratini's and went to try them out. Definitely did not disappoint! Lunch menu boasts a wide variety of seafood and meat. Had the tuna tartare which is very delicious and fresh. Service was fast and the dishes came rather quickly after one another :) Would visit again
2
The only Italian things in this restaurant are the water and the wine. The chef is Italian but his menu is a very random mix of flavours which lacks in coherence and logic. We are Italian and were hoping for a little taste of home but sadly didn't find it here. The antipasti were a mix of things from the fridge (eg slice of salame, gorgonzola and preserved mushrooms bundled together) followed by 3 types of roasts (pork, chicken and lamb) and then followed by pasta with a stew like ragu. Maybe we were just unlucky and picked the night with the worst menu. But the whole concept appeared to be more that of a Chinese restaurant with a western twist (that is the only explanation for the 3 roasts in succession and pasta at the end)The wine list is very good so maybe Fratini should be an enoteca instead. Unfortunately cannot recommend this place
5
Cosy and comfortable atmosphere! A brand new concept of "NO MENU" is the most attractive part that brought us here. Love the desserts especially! :)
5
Good food, great taste (I especially loved the tiramisu!), very nice and comfortable place for dining. Will did unitedly be back!
5
I have been here a few times already and I must say that it never fails to surprise me with a whole new experience! From the food, to the wine and the service. Everything was TOP-notch and I truly enjoyed myself. Will be back definitely!
4
We went there last Saturday with a couple of friends. The service was very good. The winelist is endless. The food was fabulous! No à la carte menu. The chef will surprise you! We will certainly go back!
5
Brought my boyfriend to Fratini for his birthday celebration after hearing great reviews about it. We were definitely not disappointed! We liked that we did not have to decide what on what to eat (because sometimes we are lazy to decide) but yet could not find anything to complain about with each dish that was served! Every dish was delectable! The service and cosy ambience were also massive plus points for us - no pressure to order excessively expensive wines (although we did order a nice wine to pair with our meal), just enjoy the food and the company of your partner

Being one of the top restaurants on Singapore trip advisor I came here with high expectations. Sadly they weren't met. The meal started of strong with great starters and appetizers(beef tenderloin with blue cheese sauce and white asparagus is a real stand out). But as the meal progressed things went from great to mediocre to down right bad. The fish with cauliflower, squid and tomatoes was okay but fish skin wasn't crispy. Pastas were just plain lazy. We were served two different types of pasta but the only thing that changed was the sauce. Everything else was practically identical. Pasta was also overcooked to the point it was more like Chinese noodles and the sauces were very flat in flavour. Desserts were disappointing. The panna cotta had far too much gelatine to the point it was borderline from being a jelly. Also one of my friends who has a mild dairy allergy was served the same desserts containing dairy. When mentioned to the service staff, instead of rectifying his mistake he tried to make an excuse by saying that most of their desserts have dairy. In the end after pushing for a different dessert all my friend got was a miserable yuzu sorbet with no deduction in the menu price. Besides that service is very slow.
1
Food in general was mediocre, with more miss than hits. The major buzz kill for me for the whole experience was during the serving of dessert; Panna Cotta, Tiramisu & Chocolate Salami was served to one of my friends who was allergic to dairy products, which was highlighted right from the start of meal to the Chef. After being informed, the service staff simply expressed that he was not aware of, and made no attempts to check with Chef if there could be any alternative made for my friends until we had to ask. To our amusement he came back with the alternative of ice cream, which had to be pointed out by us that ice cream isn't dairy free. At this point in time, Chef walked in and upon hearing of the situation and rumbling around to see what they could find they finally came back with just a pathetic Yuzu sobert, to which the same service staff made a distasteful joke which may come across as offensive, that if my friend does not like the Yuzu sobert, there is really nothing else they could do. For a restaurant with that high ratings on trip advisor, it was a very disappointing experience for us. 
5
I'm Italian, and I am quite picky and critical when it comes to food. The restaurant totally lives up to the highest expectations. Simone and his service have been beyond awesome. The "Fratini La Trattoria" experience has been from the beginning and up to the very end a culinary orgasm
5
The place is cosy, you can even have a separate room to dine. Food is exceptional: high quality, perfectly crafted, presented in the most attractive way. I told him I was vegetarian after we sat down and he managed to get me dozens of different plates. Wine is just as perfect as the food.A really true and upscale Italian experience, must try
5
I'd never been to a restaurant where patrons cannot choose their own dinners, but something told me there was a good reason this was so. I was right. The 6 course meal was extraordinary. The cold appetizers were like mini explosions of taste. The hot appetizers were delicious. I never cared for lamb until I tasted it at La Trattoria. The pasta was superb and cooked just right. The desserts were heavenly. If you enjoy being pampered and sampling a wide array of tasty food, perfectly paired with wines, try Fratini La Trattoria
5
10 of us enjoyed a superb dinner in the private room
We asked the chef to roll out dishes as he saw fit and we were well rewarded!
4
Great ambience, wine, food and company. More veges would've been good especially raw but some would say I'm fussy. Cellar selection awesome
5
The omakase concept on Italian food is nice and creative, food quality and presentation is on top notch level, atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, highly recommend.
5
Great little hidden gem with an amazing degustation menu and great range of old world wines! Friendly staff who actually knows what their staff!
5
I feel like my morther cook for me. Everything you got is the best.
The wine made you feel like you are in Toscana.
3
After reading all the reviews we really expected a bit more on the food quality. It was rather hit or miss - there were lows like the stuffed rolled pork which seemed premade and reheated so on the dry side but highs like the chicken cacciatore and seafood pasta with porcini mushrooms. Maybe I am a bit hard on the number one restaurant TripAdvisor but this is the reason why we chose it.The ambience is quite nice and homely and the service was great with the waiter choosing all our wines
5
Chose this based on #1 TA rating. Unforgettable experience. Presented with wine list then told we had even more choices if we wanted to select a bottle from their wine room. Our waiter was also a wine expert and guided us to an excellent bottle based on our preferences. Once seated again, the chef asked if there was anything we didn't like, or couldn't eat. From there began an amazing feast, artfully presented and perfectly balanced. First an array of cold appetizers, mainly seafood based...salmon, seared tuna, scallops... then hot appetizers...lamb, grouper. Everything was very fresh, light and uniquely flavored. Then we were asked what we felt like for the main pasta dish....red, white wine sauces, meat or seafood etc. We were open to anything and presented with a fresh linguini with beef, white asparagus, mushrooms and truffle oil. We were pretty full but it was so delicious we ate it all. Then we received an array of desserts which were too good to pass up. Excellent service, excellent food. Don't miss this one
5
Fratini prepares its menu from the freshest produce available daily in the markets, so the only question which is asked upon arrival is whether any of the group cannot eat, or dislikes, a particular food. After that the most delectable array of dishes are brought to the table, with each one seeming to surpass the one before. Fabulous service, friendly and knowledgeable staff and an extensive wine cellar. Do yourself a favour and put this restaurant on the top of your list
5
Had dinner with my girlfriend at Fratini and we both enjoyed the experience. The Italian chef greeted us upon arrival and was very friendly throughout. Food was really nice and for the price we paid it was worth it. Despite the crowd, service was prompt and we were seldom left waiting for our dishes. Highly recommended and suitable for any occasion! Free valet parking provided too
5
We really enjoyed our dinner here! Yummy Italian food at a nice cosy restaurant :)Love the no menu concept - really couldnt decide which course I liked the most, because all of them were sooo delicious! Ended the meal with really amazing dessert, I love the tiramisu!Very friendly staff and great customer service! Thank you for making our tummies happy and really satisfied We will definitely be back again
4
nice pplace and food was nice with fresh ingredient pasta and lasagna very nice, staff very friendly and attentive i will came back
5
All meal was great👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 ambience and service and meal awesome... I think price was expensive... Location in Bukit Timah.
5
Nice welcome and attentive chef. He will ask what you like and dislike and would cater to your needs. Good food and the amount is more than enough, worth the money

My wife and I decided to check out Fratini for a nice casual dinner out as this venue is leading the TripAdvisor scoreboard for Singapore! With that in mind our expectations were accordingly and we were willing to spend for a nice experience.The setting is very casual - blending in with all the other Italian restaurants in that square (must have been 10+ more within 5 minutes walk) both alfresco and indoor seating.The servers are polite and engaging - not over the top - just right. The Chef came out - wearing a sharply pressed black chef jacket and talked about dietary preferences and moved quickly over to the wine selection and escorted us into the wine cellar for our final wine selection.So far - all good! the food started to come along - it's like Italian tapas - fusion Italian food - dish after dish. Moved into main and pasta dishes and for some strange non Italian reason they referred to the spaghetti or pasta dish as their main course! (its not Chinese cuisine) and concluded with dessert.The main reason for why i only gave 3 stars are:1) The food is fine - but trying too much to be different. As the number one restaurant in Singapore providing a NO MENU concept in a tapas setting i expect a true "sound bite" out of every dish - i didn't. 2) The chef that came to every table presenting the menu and more is not the chef but the wine sommelier pretending to be the chef - and this totally explained why the food was ok but not stunning - we never saw the chef - so it became a bit too much a showcase as to a culinary no menu journey.3) For what we experienced - this was way below in value for money
4
Visited the restaurant for the first time. "No menu! OK, let us try", was our attitude.For a reasonable amount, SGD 50 per person, a large variety of well prepared and well presented food kept coming.The only reason for not rating it excellent was the pork, which was a bit tough and not tender and juicy, as you would expect for slow cooked pork. Otherwise everything else was great, the service, the atmosphere, and all the other dishe
5
The chef selects the menu on your behalf, whereby you try things that you normally wouldn't touch. The food is delicious, very delicate. The waiter chose white and red wines for us which was a very good match with the food. We've been there twice and we have a much better time when we visit Fratini La Tratoria compared to many other restaurants.Will definetely come back soon!

Four of us went to this highly rated Italian restaurant last night and it was a very nice experience. All the staff were very knowledgable and attentive and knew their food well taking the time to explain all the dishes as they arrived at the table. They even selected the wine for us and did a nice job, wine was not an issue. They do not have a menu and the chef asks you what you do not like and he adjusts the meal accordingly so you get the full experience without worrying about getting food you won't like. We had 8 courses and this gives you a wide varied food experience. Some you will really enjoy while others maybe not so much but it was a very good experience. It is pricey at $90 ech plus drinks so nearly a $500 bill. Worth going once for the experience
4
We had lunch, 6 courses and none we didn't enjoy. We had Appetiser, catfish, groper, lamb, seafood pasta, dessert. Favourite for me was the Pasta. Restaurant is staffed by very efficient & thoughtful people. Its clean and easy to find, taxi fare was $12 from the Fairmont. We had meal each, 1 beer, 1 wine and coffee each, bill was $150.00. Pricey but worth it to experience the variety of food cooked and served so well.
4
Searched the web site for an estimated price , it was only when we arrived we realised dinner is $90 (Singapore ) dollars each for 8 starters, a pasta dish and a desert. Chef seemed very surprised when we said we preferred fresh fish and vegetables to meat ( although not strictly vegetarian) and wine waiter couldn't believe we didn't want wine. However, the starters were all delicious and included fresh scallop, salmon with pumpkin purÃ©e, raw tuna and avocado, stuffed calamari , the only disappointing one was a veggie tomato base. Pasta was shrimp ravioli. We noticed everyone seemed to get the same pudding, a delicious earl gray pannacotta and tiramisu, but we also got a small chocolate tart as we stressed we loved chocolate . Came away feeling very full and indulged. It was a great experience
5
The "no menu"restaurant was a worry for my husband who is fussier than my 3 kids, but there was no need for concern. The chef asks if there are any intolerances or dislikes and goes from there. Food was amazing and all 3 visits here have been an adventure for my taste buds!
5
The NO-MENU experience is simply fantastic. Apprehensive at first but we were bowled over dish after dish.
Sensational.
5
no menu, but awesome food! service was extremely attentive. We were there for my husband's 40th and hired the back room for 10 of us. Brilliant atmosphere
4
The Chef really attentive, i love the food he prepared to us. portion just nice. Is a must try restaurant.
5
Went there 2weeks ago for dinner. Many interesting starters (7 i think), food was fresh and creative. Loved the desserts as well!!!
5
I have been there 3 times, and everytime I am blown away by this restaurant. I was there this time with my wife for Valentine. The personal service, the atmosphere, but above all: the food quality is always a special experience. There is no menu, but you will be asked about likes and dislikes ahead of time. This allows the chef to always create new things, rather than reproducing the same menu items again and again.Many small dishes, served sequentially, cooked to perfection. Savouring many different flavours and a delicate play with textures. Try to save some space for the desserts as well! Everything is cooked with love for food. Make sure to take at least 2-3 hours for a full dinner.It is of course in the premium segment from a price point of view, but in my opinion worth every penny. For sure I will be back there
5
Chef comes and checks with you on what you don't like. Sine we are vegetarian, we mentioned that. And there come 4 course meal - 2 starters, 1 main course and 1 desert. Good authentic Italian food for sure. SGD 45 per person - Not very expensive as compared to a good restaurant in Singapore
4
Came for lunch on TripAdvisor reviews. Was a little apprehensive on reading the negative comments. We had booked 1 week in advance. When we arrived the restaurant was half empty but we were still seated next to door. We asked to be moved but were told the other tables were reserved! They were still empty by the time we left! We were then seated at another small table. Luckily things improved from there. There is no menu so everyone has the same thing. I guess it makes it easy for the restaurant to manage their inventory. There were 3 cold and 3 hot appetisers. Each one very well done and tasty. These were followed by the seafood pasta. Again very tasty. The dessert was also very nice. The food here is delicious but the service is hit and miss. We asked for espresso after the meal but they never came. Would be 5 stars but let down by the service.
4
This restaurant is popular, be sure to make a booking, we had to make a reservation two weeks in advance. Encouraged by the positive reviews, we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed, the food was great. We enjoyed every dish. It was reasonably priced for the quality, at 90 bucks excluding tax and service charge for a 7 course meal. The environment is cosy and homely, we enjoyed conversations with the chef and service staff (one of whom who also happened to be the new owner). There were some hiccups; one young staff accidentally spilt wine over a patron; another customer asked for bread to go along with the sauce/gravy but amazingly the restaurant doesn't serve bread. I will definitely come here again, it's my kind of friendly restaurant in the neighbourhood serving excellent food. That being said, I won't deem it as the best restaurant in Singapore. Top 20 perhaps.
5
This place is really great and food is top notch and there is no menu, and you wont be disappointed. However, the owner has sold the business, and the new owner will retain the chefs and continue to innovate with new things. I am not sure how it will pan out, but I believe it will still have its home cooked charm
5
Nice restaurant with awesome food... We had lots of food that night. I like the dessert that we had. The environment was great. The chef is super nice and friendly. He likes chatting with the customers. By the way, it was a bit difficult to find the restaurant as we are tourists. And the restaurant is not located in the shopping area or near CBD. We needed to take a taxi.I would love to visit it again for mt next trip to Singapore
5
Located approx 10mins walk from Tan Kah Kee Station; Cross the overhead bridge, walk along Hillcrest Road. There's no menu. Chef dished out couple of appetisers, spaghetti and desserts. All food comes in petite size but we felt sooo full.
5
This made my stay in Singapore! Never ever leave the country without eating here. I loved how they don't have a menu and every food that's coming is just unbelievably awesome! Will definitely be back
5
This was the BEST service we received all week in Singapore! It was a well oiled machine the night we ate here. The chef comes to your table and asks what your likes and dislikes are. BE VERY SPECIFIC is my only advice and you will have an amazing meal!! The chef absolutely will cater to what you like and don't like as long as you tell him!! We neglected to tell him that 3 of us did not like mushrooms and the final pasta dish was a mushroom, prawn, cheese ravioli with a mushroom sauce. My husband thought it was delicious, but the rest of us were not fans! That was totally our fault! The sauces were the absolute highlights of the night. A different sauce for 8 different appetizers?! Crazy and spot on! All were delicious! Come hungry, because you will get a lot of food!! The desserts were dreamy! I highly recommend!
5
One of the 3 best restaurants in Singapore (together with FOC and Blu Kuzina) and, for sure, the best italian. Attentive service, quality ingredients and reasonable (not cheap) price. Much better value for money compared with most of the posh restaurants in the city center. A must visit
5
The ambience: Unlike the romantic ambience that you expect from a themed restaurant, the theme is "no menu". Thus make sure your gf or wife knows it so that she will not be fussy over the surroundings. The food: Pretty normal display, homely but yet sufficient. The cooks work according to your dietary requirements and it met our expectations. Disagree with some that Singaporeans don't know Italian food but some of us who been to many eating places certainly know about what is good taste and great taste and the food is good. The entrees and appetizers are excellent.Let down: The mains: which is a pastas. A little simple and plain but the meal was saved by the dessert.Value: With this amount of food and the almost excellent taste of food, it's worth the celebrations

Reservation was easily done on the restaurant website the day before.The restaurant was located in a small food hub of a residential area so the environment was quiet and peaceful when we arrived in the evening. Valet parking was provided free for diners.The owner, Gabriel Fratini, personally welcomed us at the doorstep and showed us to our table. There was no menu hard copy. The Chef checked for dietary restrictions and then informed us he would be serving dinner course according to his menu of the night. That took away the fuss of deciding what to order.The decor was modern, clean and cozy. It was the ideal place for couples and small groups. There were longer tables inside the restaurant for gatherings.We were treated to 7 courses. The star for us was the lamb slices with sweet potato purÃ©e. It was cooked to perfection. It was yender, tasty and juicy. We decided not to have wine but we were pretty sure the wines would enhance the dining experience further.For just over $200 for a couple, we felt it was great value. Will we return? Yes, we certainly will
5
No menu, but who needs one when the chef personally visits your table to discuss your likes and dislikes? Degustation menu was generous, and allows for even the fussiest of eaters to enjoy a wide selection of tasty morsels. Wine selection was amazing!!! We had a limited edition Italian Sav Blanc (I promised my wife I would remember the name, but the last glass clearly did me no good). Excellent service from all the wait staff who had great interaction with every table, even Chef Gabriel personally delivered some of our courses. We have to say from owning businesses ourselves, to see how involved Gabriel was in every aspect of his business was extremely impressive. Everything from booking our table to the service on the night shows great commitment, which should be highly commended.Whilst it is on the more expensive end of meals we have had in Singapore it was worth every dollar and we couldn't recommend it more highly
5
We had a works meal and tried the tasting menu, this was truly excellent. The food was prepared and served very well and every dish was of a high standard. I would highly recommend this restearaunts for the ambience, food & price. One of the best I have been to in my 5 years in Singapore
5
Had a wonderful dinner here, at the recommendation of my friend. There was no menu but the chef came by to ask about our food preferences. The food was excellent, we had several tapas-style dishes which were mainly seafood. The pasta dish at the end was delicious. Overall, we had a good time here - excellent food, nice ambience.
2
We arrived to a friendly fanfare of the staff greeting us and the chef arriving at our table to ask if there was anything we would not eat, my partner has a shellfish allergy and the chef said he would accommodate and then promptly forgot and the first medley of dishes came with some shellfish as did later dishes. It was obvious we got the same dishes as everyone else which were averagely presented and were bland to eat. Don't get me wrong the ingredients were fresh and well sourced but with no seasoning or flare that Italian food is famous for. I would suggest there are better places to eat, the atmosphere was good but the food lacked the wow factor
5
The 3 of us had a fantastic evening with italian gourmet dinner. We were not prepared for a set menue, but that was ok because it fullfilled all expectations you can have for such a dinner outside of Italy.
But be hungry when you arrive.
5
Delicious food, awesome staff, very nice place to have dinner i must say i cant wait to come back and visit again!
5
Don't expect a menu because they don't have one. Just turn up and trust head chef and owner Gabriel Fratini to prepare an amazing meal for you. We had a feast that included beef cheeks, lobster pasta and a tasting plate for dessert. The staff are incredibly friendly and Gabriel calls past your table for a chat. Can't rate the dining experience high enough and worth the 15 cab ride without question. We will certainly be back but we will skip lunch before we go next time.
5
The restaurant is located in one of our favourite haunts but we didn't realise that there is such a gem in this little villagey area until recently.I tried to make a reservation online but the system kept prompting me to another day. Fed up, I'd decided to just pick up the phone and I was told that there was just one table left for Saturday night! So I was lucky.My Wife and I had a outdoor table. Service was friendly and prompt. It was good that this is a "no menu" restaurant so we left everything to Chef Fratini.We had a seven course dinner - cold appetisers, cod fish, chicken meat ball, pork ribs, lamb with rice, ravioli and finally desserts! The food comes in small portions and all were very well presented.Overall it was a very enjoyable meal. I would recommend this restaurant especially if you are celebrating a special occasion
3
We had dinner here on a weekday night. Lured by the raving reviews obviously expectations were quite high. Although the food was definitely nice, I don't think there was anything incredible or superb about it. What the restaurant does really well however is atmosphere: the chef comes to your table to meet you, he asks about foods you don't like or are allergic too, and then he says he will prepare you something very special. We were served an appetizer, starter, a small in-between dish, main course and desert. The food was definitely good but where we felt the chef needs to work harder is presentation; it all looks very average. Time in-between courses was fairly long and at some point we noticed that guests who had come in later were served their next course before us which made us realise that the staff had forgotten that we had not had our next course yet. When a small but very loud group of three came in we asked for a different table which we were promptly given, however the noise level of the other party continued to bother us. As the staff was aware of our complaint it was somewhat disappointing to note that they were not at all inclined to ask the other guests to keep noise levels down. In total our bill with one bottle of wine (S$98) and two glasses of chocolate liquor as an 'extra' desert came down to around four hundred dollars. I would recommend this place for a fun evening out but for high-end Italian food there are better options in town

My wife and I were looking for a truly exceptional restaurant for our anniversary and Fratini surpassed anything we could have hoped for. Every item on any critics checklist was met from professionalism to artistry to flavor. The Chef loves what he does and it shows. The restaurant is not inexpensive (about $250S for dinner and wine) but I don't regret a single cent as every member of their team poured their hearts into making this an exceptional, and at the same time slightly understated, experience. In the top 3-5 meals I have ever had. We will return when we have extra special friends in country to visit. Last notes, make a reservation and be sure to engage their team in conversation. Only when the deserts arrived did we realize that the charming "hostess" was a London culinary academy graduate who made and served the delicious sweets at the end. The chef is quite a character as well, in a very good way

Remember, it's a no menu restaurant. You will be serve what the chef has, best ingredients he can find on that day.It was a farewell dinner for one of the colleague and she requested for risotto, which was not on the chef's menu for that day. Such a last minute request but the chef decides to accommodate... such a short notice and with limited ingredients the risotto is simply delicious. This shows the skill of the chef.Of course, the other dishes served were also splendid.It's not cheap, but it's worth a visit once a whil

We booked our visit here on the strength of the Trip advisor reviews and in the search for something different. Greeted by Gabriel, a quick chat to discuss culinary dislikes/allergies, I felt quickly reassured that despite the lack of menu I would be served a delicious meal. I was not disappointed. Delightful combinations of taste, texture and colour tingled our taste buds with fish, meat and pasta. The atmosphere is fairly informal and comfortable, well worth the trip out of the city
5
This restaurant offers the most amazing experience and it is made more special by Chef Gabriel, who handles and serves his customers personally, therefore the service is extremely personalised as Chef Gabriel takes the time to get to know each of his customers personally as he serves them. That aside, the food is outstanding. Chef Gabriel's pasta is the best I have ever had in the world! For $45 per person for lunch, this really is one of the best restaurants in Singapore and I am going to return very soon

Good old Trip Advisor, done it again. This would have to be one of the best restaurants we've ever been to. A warm welcome by Gabriel the restuarant owner greeted us upon our arrival. Gabriel then first explained the theme of the venue and what we were to be served (no menu!!) then helped with the selection of wine. The food arrived and WOW what a meal. Several courses each different and cooked and presented beautifully. All the staff were very friendly and attentive to your every needs. Bottom line you really need to experience this restaurant yourself to really appreciate what it has to offer. Overall a great experience. Thanks Gabriel and staff

This is one of our favorite Italian restaurants. Interesting food and unpretentious. Chef comes to every table to say hi.
5
Service is great. Unique experience. No menu but all needs catered for. Fantastic experience. Will be a return customer.
5
Every time I go there, Chef Fratini always prepares a special meal for me and no menu required ! Whatever he cooks is what he bought that day and its super fresh !! Will not disappoint !
5
Very wallet friendly, delicious food, and warm service can't wait to come back to Singapore and have it all again! A must visit in Singapore

We booked a reservation for lunch, based on trip advisor reviews. And it was well worth it. We were served an array of fresh and delectable appetizers. We had servings of prawns, chicken, pork, salmon, cod fish with unique sauces. Pasta for mains was good too. Tiramisu and poached pear for dessert were light and delicious. The presentation was great and the portion sizes throughout the lunch were optimal. Wine options were good, and we finished off with a cup of coffee.The chef and his staff were welcoming and it was a joy to eat here. Highly recommended.Minor suggestion: There was a slight inconsistency in explaining each dish. Maybe one or two were served with little info. You could serve the dishes with hand-written or printed notes of what it contains. Should serve well when there is no menu.This is an excellent place, regardless

My wife and I were spending Xmas in Singapore visiting our son and his six month pregnant wife from UK.It was suggested that we visit Fratini's on Xmas eve but we're very disappointed when we discovered that no table was available so we immediately enquired about availability for New Year's Eve and we were delighted to secure the last table. What a relief as we had a most memorable evening. Everything about the evening was superb.Fratini's is not a large restaurant and there is definitely a family atmosphere about the place. From the moment we approached the front door until we left we were made to feel really special by Gabriel and all the staff. This seemed to be the same with all clients and that summarises the care taken with all visitors. A welcoming skill in a country that has not always proved to be commendable for customer service !There is no menu but Gabriel comes to your table to discuss any problems with varieties of food and tells you what he intends to cook using the freshest locally available produce. This was important for us due to Nancy's pregnancy and this was really cared for in relation to the food provided.The table was well provided with party paraphernalia which we used to engender a great atmosphere. Now to the food which would have graced any fine dining establishment. We were treated to six courses beautifully presented and expertly cooked. Each course was expertly described to explain the ingredients and cooking methods. Again we were impressed with the way Nancy's needs were taken into account and met. It was nice to be given plenty of time between courses not to feel over-faced.There was a great wine list to compliment the food. All in all a magnificent evening and a certainty that we will be re-visiting later in the year on our next out here. Thanks to all at Fratini's for a wonderful evening with great memories.Ala
5
The best kind of restaurant! Everything was delicious, each of the 7 and more courses. The owner chooses the food, so there's no menu, as in village restaurants in Italy. Excellent Barolo and delicious desert wines. Service was very good and the atmosphere was smart, relaxing, intimate and professional. It's mid-priced, though the wines are pricey, as everywhere in Singapore. But you really get looked after.
4
Excellent Italian trattoria, although the concept of Italian trattoria is very different from the one established in Singapore. The food was good and I was satisfied by the quality and appearance, unfortunately the portions were small. Menu is not very extensive, and prices a little excessive, perhaps normal for the Singapore market but high for me. Anyway it was a good experienc
5
Before talking about the dinner, I want to thank Gabriel and Mino for the nice chat we had with everyone of them. This restaurant is not only about what you eat; it is about the service and the nice people you discuss with.The food comes in 6 rounds with a sequence of seafood-meat-seafood etc...Everything is fresh and tasty. The first round's highlight was the Tuna carpaccio. It comes from another planet: Mesmerizing and so creative. The quality of the ingredients and the freshness of the avocado takes you away.Then, you go for the desert. Gabriel is an artist. You start with a simple and light Tiramisu before indulging into the Panna Cotta with a touch of Passion Fruit and Mango on the top

So - finally, managed to try Fratini La Trattoria. Listed as #1 restaurant in Singapore on Trip Advisor. Since i am also a contributor on TA, I often believe and put high accounts on TA reviews. The restaurant is owned by Chef Gabriel Fratini - of course, an Italian who has been cooking for 43 yrs of his life. 22 years in Asia (Singapore, Jakarta, Thailand, etc). He owned this small restaurant for 2.5years. His restaurant DOES NOT have menu. Yes you got that right. So what happen is - Gabriel will come and chat with you directly to see what you like/don't like/dietary restriction - and he will cooked something right and something nice for you. He served us: 5 small plates of appetizers 1 main (Shrimp Ravioli)1 set of desserts (tiramisu, panacota, caramelized apple)The place is not fancy or high end dining setting. Located a bit further from the city center in a small shopping complex. Can reach out by taxi. I'd say it was quite a divine dining experience knowing that he cooked without menu and spontaneously. All meals were amazingly tender, delicate and has its authenticity on the flavor. I'd say its Gabriel Flavor. rsvp is required because they have limited tables. Restaurant isn't too big. cost us around sgd$100/pax (with 2-3 glasses of wine).Service is great and quite fast, however sometimes i need to wave to get the attention because they are simply busy. I noticed they also have a private room at the end of the restaurant for group booking. Restaurant atmosphere is cozy on its own standard. Yes - i will come again. Keen to try his other spontaneous cooking for sure
5
Nice ambience, great food, friendly staff.. Will come back again for sure, the taste of the food is awesome
3
The service rendered was excellent staff served fast and always putting on a smile , The food was simple and average tasting .
5
The food is simple but taste extraordinary. Each dish is innovative and delicately balanced in taste. The ingredients combinations compliments each other. Totally enjoyable.
Staff are both attentive and friendly. What more can you ask for.
5
Overall great experience. A truly delightful surprise. friendly staff. A wide variety of cold, warm apetizers, main dishes and deserts.
4
Great for people who cannot decide what they want to eat. Chef took note of things that we do not eat and cooked up a storm with whatever there is in the kitchen that day.
5
Had a dinner there last week. Excellent food (5 separate delicious starters), main and dessert. We were too stuffed to finish off the dessert!

Dined here yesterday for lunch with my family to celebrate my wife's birthday. Booked two days early only to find limited seats for lunch only on the specific day. I strongly suggest that you make your reservation as early as possible to prevent disappointment. I called him a day earlier to let him know about our dietary restrictions which he took note of and happily obliged to cook a great lunch for us. They warmly escorted us to our table. The chef came by and introduced himself and went on to explain what to expect for lunch. The meal consisted of 5 courses. Cold appetizers, warm appetizers, more warm appetizers, mains and desserts.Within ten minutes, the first course of cold appetizers arrived. Avocado with burrata and roasted red pepper and sun dried tomatoes. Then came the first set of warm appetizers- broccoli stuffed porcini mushroom baked with mozzarella cheese. The second course of warm appetizers consisted of grilled zucchini stuffed with spinach and eggplant baked with parmesan cheese. Then came the mains, Angel hair pasta with zucchini and eggplant. For desserts it was tiramisu and passion fruit panna cotta and we ended the meal with a cup of cuppuccino.Each and every dish had a unique touch to it which any foodie will definitely appreciate. The baked mushroom was served on a bed of crunchy purple cabbage.The burrata complemented the avocado very well and like wise for the zucchini and spinach. The pasta was slightly oily but loaded with heaps of zucchini and egg plant bits. The desserts were pleasing too. Passion fruit panna cotta was really refreshing.The no-menu concept really works well as it keeps you excited. Even the finer details were taken care of and the impressive presentation of food deserves appreciation.The service was great too. Plates were cleared promptly in between courses and the waiting time was less than five minutes to serve the next course once you're done with the previous one. Do note that this restaurant is "not child-friendly", exact words from the lady owner, when we requested for a child seat. We were taken aback as we have dined at countless restaurants worldwide and this was our first time coming across a self-proclaimed non child-friendly restaurant.Overall, it was a pleasant experience with tasty food, superb service. The lunch was pretty reasonably priced at $50 per pax without wine pairing ( excluding taxes of course!) and a dinner will cost twice as much. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore

Chef Gabriel Fratini will come and have a chat with you for a start about what you prefer to eat or avoid and will customize the meal for you. There's no menu as such but everything that comes your way tastes very good. I'm vegetarian, my wife won't eat beef and prefers to avoid chicken, we wend once with another couple where the lady eats very little and guy will eat anything and loves his meat. Everyone came away happy. Savor the starter rounds - they are my favorite and in just the right quantities. Surprisingly the main course, such as it is, because by then you've already tucked in fair amount has been the lest pleasing both times we ate there but still quite good. The poached apple and rain pls a tiramisu as dessert were very good - particularly the tiramisu, but I was disappointed that it was exactly the same each time.Nonetheless, a good meal in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere
5
Refreshing experience with each course.Total of 6 courses, and had a wonderful evening with the friendly owner, chefs and servers. Tips: make a reservation at least a day before (restaurant can be be fully booked as there is not a lot of tables), and have an empty stomach before you come, the courses though might be different, they are rather filling
4
Ecclectic and funky degustation Italian restaurant. With a fabulous Lady-Owning host ! No menu on offer. What they offer is what you get! Daily market sourced and fresh to the table. Simple yet modern decor. Good range of Italian Beers and Wines.Chefs walk the table and converse with patrons. Nice touch this. Its refreshing and seldom ever seen...Dont expect huge servings or to be full when you walk out the door. Its satisfying, different, engaging and enough. Its not cheap but worth the effort if you have the money.Highly recommended, if you like Italian or you'd like to try something out of the ordinary.....
5
This is my first review on tripadvisor solely because I feel the need to recommend this place having dine here 4-5 times.
Service is top notched and professional. Food is cooked with passion, and quality is maintained regardless how busy this place is.
Totally recommended!
5
Best Italian restaurant here in Singapore. We are in town since 4 weeks and we missed Italian food. We browsed and found this trattoria which is great for food, wine and atmosphere.
5
The atmosphere is super friendly and the food is supremely delicious! The fact that there is no manu guarantees that the food is always fresh. The best Italian restaurant in Singapore!
3
Loved the overall atmosphere but the food was over seasoned, pasta was over cooked, and did not felt there was a real standout dish. I like the overall concept and staff was friendly. Would be shocked to have this as top-rated restaurant in my city.
4
I have to review this place even though I visit it at least one a month now I leave in Singapore ...every time mouth watering food and great vibes with amazing people, the owner has pulled it off here it a full 5 and must be or I wouldn't keep coming back ...excellent
5
As always Chef Fratini asked for our likes, dislikes or allergies and proceeded to have us served with a delicious variety of Italian dishes which looked as good as they tasted. He and his wife along with Mino and the wait staff provided excellent service a usual in a very relaxed atmosphere. Definitely one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore
5
We have eaten here many times and this is why. It is a family run Restaurant and Fratini greets personally when you arrive and you feel part of the Family after this. There is no menu. He will check if you have allergies and prepare accordingly. For lunch there are four amazingly inventive starters, for dinner there are eight, so go there hungry. Then a main course of pasta and finally a selection of deserts. Lunch is particularly good value, as in so many places, but it is a large lunch and not for every day! There is a private room at the rear for about 12 people and I entertained once there. The food does not change for a larger group and is still excellent. Highly recommende
5
Amazing food and great service! We called them the previous day to say that we are vegetarians. There is no menu and we were served a 7 course meal plus 3 small desserts. Portions were small and hence we could comfortably finish all the 7 courses. The main course was Ravioli with spinach in porcini sauce with little bit of cheese. It was so tasty and yet very light. We paid $90++ for each meal but it is definitely worth the money! Strongly recommended. Please call them a day in advance so that they can understand your needs better
5
I have now enjoyed this restaurant several times, for work for celerations with the family. Every time is is so special for the guests. The owner Gabriel is both charming and an artist. He welcomes all guests with great warmth and flair. He explains the journey you will go in with him. He ensures that every step is a pleasure.For me it is an evening of enjoyemen
5
Well impressed by Fratini's friendly services and the very fresh and tasty seafood especially the salmon and cod appetizers which were tasty and appeared to melt in your mouth. Other ingredients of dishes like crayfish, pawns, crab meat, scallops were fresh, excellent and won't disappoint any seafood lover! The main course of seafood pasta was beautiful too! Chatty Chef Gabriel is brilliant and regarded by me as "Pavarotti" of Italian cuisine, who orchestrates every note and tempo on the plate so well that I could hardly find competitive chef. We'll be back
5
We were recommended to friends to visit this restaurant.
we was impressed with everything here , the food delicious , profressional especially staff
would definitely come back here
5
Probably only few restaurant offer different menu evrytime you go there
Gabriele drives you in a unique food experience to a simply and real food taste
UNBELIEVABLE
3
Went for a dinner there . Some pairing of food are Creative but some are hit and missed . The appetisers are better than the main.
Overall we paid $500 for three of us , with a bottle of wine.
5
Passion, creativity and incredibly very good food ... plus a very welcoming chef/maitre/sommelier like Gabriel Fratini ... a must go in Singapore !
5
the concept is great, the owner very charming, the food is delicious, the service exceptional and made the evening very special. Would def recommend it!
5
This is probably the 12th or 13th time that I have dinner with my friends at Fratini's since my 1st time last Decemebr! My friends have always wondered what makes this place so special for my loyalty and addiction! Honestly, I've been thinking a lot and asking the same question! Finally, I've got the answer last night and it's all about Chef Gabriel's passion and devotion of cooking! He has prepard such an wonderful dinner for us that is way beyond our imagination and expectation! Every dish that he has made was delicious and exquisite that I just don't know how to put my experience into words! All I can said is we were enjoying the masterpiece of 43 years of Italian cooking from Chef Gabriel the whole night! He's just like Michael Jorden in basketball that will always bring the game into a higher level!!! Chef gabriel, my deep thankfulness and gratitude to your love of cooking
5
NYers are known to be hard to please. Try 5 NYers including a first generation American Italian who cans his own tomato sauce every year lol. Chef Gabriel was able to accommodate a plethora of allergies (peanuts, shellfish, dairy etc.) and create a one-of-a-kind dining experience! Relinquish control as there is no menu but be prepared to indulge in a 10 course delectable delight, each one more delicious than the last, from the cod stuffed passion fruit to the delectable mango puree topped pannacotta. An experience not to be missed when you visit Singapore.***and if you are very,very lucky, there may be a magic show in store for you ;
5
Gabriel, his wife and his great staff gave us a wonderful evening last night at Frantini's! It was our first visit and we had no idea what to expect, but we were encouraged with all the great reviews! It did not disappoint .. in fact it was even better than we imagined! The theme of multiple courses enabled us to savour all sorts of different flavours, all cooked to perfection! Nothing quite like it in Singapore, totally original and it really touched the 'sweet' spot! By the way 'sweets' were divine all delivered in an unique way! Go try ... you will have a fun evening, Gabriel is a real master of good food, beautifully presented and with a different style! Thanks for looking after us .. even to being the last to leave! We will be back!
5
This is clearly one of the best Restaurants i have ever visited in Singapore. The food, the staff and the location is excellent. The special thing about this Restaurant is the menu. You don't know what food will await you. No matter what food will await you, it will always taste very good
5
Good Italian restaurant is known about it's capocuoco. It's so relieving just to plunge in and hear that "Trust me. I know what I'm doing". And he really knew. So, no menus here. We were there for lunch and we trusted the capocuoco. And what nice lunch we had. Not just three courses but, well I don't remember how many courses we had. Maybe 5-6. We could concentrate on discussion and taste different servings with nice glass of wine. And what I find typical Italian and very homely is to see other customers to disappear when you just lay back, take your time and follow waiters to clean tables and prepare the restaurant for the evening. Then you think that you in a way belongs to this place, you are part of it.
5
Loved the freshness of the food and traditional Italian cooking with chef's own twist. They don't have a menu and would cook whatever fresh food is available at the market in the morning. Also the wine recommendation was was fantastic. Highly recommended.
4
Went for lunch. No menu, a little expensive but the food worth trying for. Good experience, Go ahead and try!
4
We followed the recommendations and reserved a table for a girl's night out. We were not disappointed. A glass of prosecco followed by several small taster dishes which were deliciously concocted by the chef. Then a plate of pasta arrived and we finished with 3 mini desserts. The food was delicious but I must admit that for the price (270$ for 2 for food, glass of prosecco, glass of wine) I found it rather expensive and have had better food at a more reasonable price elsewhere
5
The concept of the restaurant is to lean back and enjoy... No worries about what to choose as this restaurant doesn't have a menu. You eat what they serve and you have to trust their skills and taste... Frankly it is an experience worth to try and enjoy. A full 4-course menu frame with 3 different starters, 6 different small mains, 1 big pasta dish and 3 different desserts. You need to bring time as nothing goes in a hurry and have a look on the wine list which is great. Enjo
4
went there for a corporate dinner for a group of 7. The Chef came over explaining what he had that day and asked what each of us could not eat due to allergy or something. From there, it was his show. No menu, food just kept coming and all were good. Some were outstanding. He also paired with the wine he selected and they were really good. All had a good time
5
Fratini La Trattoria is a very special establishment with the no menu concept and an open kitchen. The no menu concept takes away the hassle of ordering for yourself and your guests. Chef and owner Gabriel decides on the menu everyday depending on what he buys fresh from the market each morning. Everyone is served a variety of cold and hot starters, a pasta dish and an assortment of desserts. Gabriel personally talks to every table and will cater for individual dietary restrictions. The open kitchen along the side of the restaurant allows you to have a peek to watch your meal being prepared by Gabriel and his team.I have visited this restaurant on various occasions with family, friends and guests. Each time the menu has been tweaked, with new dishes introduced. Gabriel's food is innovative yet strictly traditionally Italian. Me and my dining companions always enjoyed our meals here. At $90-100++ per person for dinner without drinks, it is not inexpensive but you do get great value for the quality, quantity and variety of food.During service, Chef Gabriel and his wife are constantly moving around the restaurant, checking the kitchen, serving, talking and joking with every one of their guests and making sure that they are having a good meal. To me, this speaks volumes about the pride and effort the owners personally put into every service and attention to detail to ensure that their customers and guests have an enjoyable experience at their restaurant.Highly recommended
5
This is my 5th visit to Fratini's and every time it gets better and better . Gabriel is not only an extremely talented chef but also a great character , truly an incredible host .He designed an outstanding meal with selection of various tasting portions , ending with a very large tagliolini with Fresh porcini & Crayfish ! The Tuna tartar and the slow cooked beef Brasato style were to die for :-) We had two bottles of Paolo e Noemia D'Amico Atlante , cabernet franc , very deep and with elaborated tannins & and rich finish, and another bottle of Pecorino from the land of Chef Fratini , great accompany to the food options .Thank you again for a great night , truly one of the best experience I have ever had and I personally work in F&B at a senior level so I have seen many great concepts around the world !Well done for your Passion Grabriel , keep up the good work 
5
This is the place to visit for an unique experience. The chef greets you personally to determine if there any food allergies etc. He then creates a creative, outstanding meal just for you. He also personally selected our bottle of wine which complemented our meal perfectly. The chef and his wife make a great team, and they check on you frequently during the meal to make sure your meal is a memorable one. They succeeded beautifully.
5
No set menu but the chef and owner Gabriel designed the menu around the preferences of the group. What sets this restaurant aside from many others not only is the exceptional quality of the food but the ambience that Gabriel sets. His jolly and jovial attitude makes the dining experience something specia
5
I have visited this restaurant on four occasions. Either for romantic dinner on a special occasion, or as part of a small group. The food and service has never disappointed…it is consistently excellent. There is no menu and the food served has varied on each occasion. Dietary requirements are catered for. It is not inexpensive, however great value for money for an upmarket restaurant. My recommendation is to eat lightly prior, as even big eaters should be satisfied with the serving size. I can’t wait to go back
5
Great evening by Fratini, food was just delicious, perfect dish presentation, taste was heaven. And as extra Chef Fratini explained in details all the dishes he served and he suggested divine wines through the dinner. Great place, i will definately return.
4
This was my second time there and the ambience was cosy but upmarket. There were cases of wine everywhere but no wine list nor menu. They recommend all for you. That is the good and the bad. The chef decided on the menu for the day and everyone went along with the ride. The food was really excellent, and can't be faulted. This is a good idea for those who really don't want to choose, rather than be left with a surprise. However, don't expect this to be a cheap meal, since it cost $110 per head without alcohol. It would be better if the costs were clearer for wine and food since no one tells you until the bill arrives
5
How restaurants should be. There is no menu. Gabriel, the Italian chef, goes to the market everyday, sees what is fresh and cooks up a marvelous concoction of re-visited traditional Italian dishes. As he says "why would I go to a restaurant to eat poorly?" Feels like home, not something easy to say for an Italian in Southeast Asia...
5
I have been to this area but wondered why I miss this wonderful restaurant. Probably due to the closed appearance of the restaurant compared to the other Italian restaurants which are brighter and more open. I was pleasantly surprised with the friendly owner and chef, Grabiel who cook what are on that day and served 'omakase' style. No menu, just eat what the chef sertved. For 5 of us, we paid about SGD 50 for the food which included 5 starterrs, a meat consisting of a lamb chop and a crayfish pasta. The sumptious meal was finsihed off with 3 desserts and nohting beats them so far in Singapore. Thumbs up
5
We just flew in for work and did not have anything planned. Saw this place and decided to swing by . Fortunately there was a place as this place is packed and requires reservation. THERE IS NO MENU. The chef prepared a stater , 3 cold and 3 hot. A pasta and desert. I will definitely comeback and its worth the visit of you want to experience some authentic Italian cooking. It's a cost place and the staff were friendly . They even booked a cab for us :
1
Beware of how they Honour the bookings. I had mine confirmed in writing together with their partner Quandoo.sg only to receive a message later to cancel because they were fully booked?? I Guess I will not try again soon..
5
As the title says, there is no menu. Great concept for a chef to cook whatever tickles his fancy and for a diner who ends up ordering the same thing at every Italian restaurant. The chef pronounces that all food is freshly bought that day, asks if your palate rejects anything and then proceeds to serve up 3-4 starters (can't recall), a main pasta and 3 desserts! Mind you, the portions weren't stingy and were chock full of seafood goodness. With a bottle of wine between six people, it cost about $165 and there was lots of pasta left over.
4
From the moment i walked in, both my wife and I were greeted by very a friendly wait staff and chef. It was our first time there and since it was rated the best my wife and I decided to go there for our date night. The chef is really friendly and you just briefly tell him what you want and he decides the whole menu for you. It isn't my first time dining like this but this is one of the best experiences my wife and I had. I felt the pricing was reasonable for the quality of service and food we have that night. We will go back again when there is a different menu to try the other food from the chef
5
Have been to Frantini on 2 consecutive Saturdays with my family after seen all the fantastic reviews, first occasion was for my dad's birthday, we were so impressed with everything in the restaurant thus went back on the very following Saturday again. My husband and I chose wine pairing. The food, drinks and services are simply amazing and flawless, definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. We'll be back soon
5
Where do I start? This restaurant was recommended by friends who told us about the 'no menu' concept. On arrival we were welcomed in and the experience began. Chef Fratini asked us about our food likes/dislikes and any intolerances before matching some wine. First up was a platter of cold appetizers, each exquisitely prepared and sooo tasty. Hot appetizers came out one by one and were also delicious. The pasta course of beautiful fresh pasta with salmon and seafood was magic, but I had a leave a little room for the delicious dessert that I knew would arrive afterwards. I was not disappointed. Tiramisu, chocolate pudding with mango, and creme brulee. Could not fault the food, it even encouraged me to eat fish that I normally wouldn't pick on a menu. I have not eaten at a 'no menu' restaurant before and reflected that half of the fun is not knowing what will be arriving at the table next. The service was excellent with very friendly wait staff. A great night out
5
My 10 year old daughter, a picky eater loved the food and humorous chef and owner, Mr Frattini. She finished her food in double quick time. Food was very tasty and authentic.
5
Authentic Italian food! I went there for a business lunch and was perfect. Cozy atmosphere. You just mention your preferences and no need to spend more time ordering as they will create for you! One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore!
5
This is a very special Italian restaurant. There is no menu and the main chef asks what you don't like to eat before he starts bringing out wonderful and imaginative Italian food. Really top quality food and service and I highly reccomend.
5
it was recommended by my colleagues, I had a pasta, red wine and potato wedges; fresh, authentic and awesomely tasting food. service staff were courteous and greatly helpful
4
We went for a birthday dinner and were seated in their cosy back room. Super friendly chef and wife team plus their staff make you feel welcome. Good value for money - 4 cold appetizers, 4 hot appetizers, pasta and 3 types of dessert plus wine recommended by the chef fills you to the brim. I liked the cold appetizers and the hot appetizer of squid best. Must try
5
Despite being 12000 miles far away from home going to La trattoria feels in many ways to be at home.No menu freshly cooked food and each day something different and interesting to try.If you like to get served without ordering and feel a little of true Italian food give it a try
5
After reading the reviews on TA I just had to experience this restaurant for myself and I was not disappointed. Being pregnant I couldn't enjoy the matching wines but I was very pleased at how accommodating chef Gabriel was with my dietary requirements and I don't feel like I missed out on anything. Each course was delicious and some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten, I especially loved that there wasn't a menu as it adds to the excitement of what is going to come out next! My husband had a seafood pasta and he rated it as the best that he has had in a very long time, generous servings and generous with the seafood. Service was impeccable and the staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves Italian food and we will definitely be back next time we are in Singapore
5
Deeply impressed by the Chef's passion to food, wine and his customers. Through the chef designed menu, you can feel the great harmony, contrast and surprises the Chef (Fratini) had created in his symphony of gourmet dinner. The environment is homely, staff are very nice and service is superb. Really one of the best dinners I ever had in Singapore
5
Visited Fratini La Trattoria for dinner and the food and company were excellent. Gabriel and all the staff were entertaining and knowledgeable and the combination of ingredients led to a truly delicious meal. The whole ambience and concept at the restaurant makes a refreshing change and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone and indeed would love to return again one day.

Travelling with a family of fussy eaters normally means someone in the family compromises when it comes to restaurant selection . Not here WOW WOW WOW !Gabriel is not only a great, great chef but a master of the universe when it comes to engaging his guests. Rarely will you every experience such a hands on approach. He asked a few choice questions to the children in regards to there likes and dislikes, then asked our dislikes or dietary requirements and no sooner he was instructing his team who shot of in 5 different directions to get things underway. The whole process and selection of courses was tailored to each persons tastes and then explained in detailed to not only us but special attention to the children. The food was magnificent but the experience was one of those that we will take with us forever. The price, no more than I expected for a destination like this ! Simply WOW

The best food and the best cheef.
I love it. If you go once you taste it and you need to come again and again and again....

The food is always an experience. We eat out often and this is without a doubt one our favourites. Even better it's priced affordably. Treat yourself to not only an excellent dinner but an experience

My wife and I were initially seeking a nice quiet Italian restaurant for the evening together. Preferably a small, cozy place away form the hustle and bustle of the City.After doing some simple research I was surprised to find Fratini La Trattoria in a convenient out-of-town location. Furthermore it has been listed in TripAdvisor as Singapore's #1 restaurant. I am afraid it’s not!!!They have a “No Menu” system, whereby the customer arrives and food is served on tray and plates in a set order. I think the idea of having "No Menu" is great, but when you serve customers blindly the dishes need to be interesting, well prepared and tasty. There was nothing in the blind menu that I can honestly say was delightful or inspiring...I'm afraid that maybe I had set my expectations too high after seeing that Fratini occupied the #1 Singapore restaurant position in TripAdvisor. Cold Starters: The cold starters were OK, but only OK.. I cannot think of one of the selection of cold starters that I thought was really good.Warm Starters: The warm starters, well the Chicken meatball was good...Pasta: The Pasta came out, and it was Prawn with large pasta loops. It still had the musty prawn taste.. it was a bit weird..Desert: Lastly, the desert Ice cream was strange too..The coffee was good. And regarding the free Valet parking, well you are encourage to pay for the free valet parking.The waiter’s language ability was poor, and I think the restaurant is pumped up to be more than it really is.I have lived in Singapore for many years and there are plenty of cozy and discreet Italian restaurants that can do better... I personally won't be going back to Fratinis. It is, and no offence to the owners, only Average.

I tried many Italian food in worldwide, no matter in the luxury hotel or street food style restaurants. Fratini La Trattoria is the best, but the location is very far from central district. One of their gimmick is "No menu", it's very good for somebody they are difficult to choose the dishes from menu. The food is very goo
5
The food was out of the world. Chef Gabriel is a culinary magician. Everything served tasted better than the other. Prawns in passionfruit was surprisingly brilliant given I would have never imagined a combination like that. Tiramisu was so delicious that I shameless went and asked for extra servings, even if I had to pay extra. Chef was kind enough to just scoop out some for me for free! Even the two wines we tried from the menu didn't disappoint. Am definitely going to come back. Cant wait to be delighted and surprised again.
5
This is a small and cozy place. No menu here, Gabriel the artist, will create a tasting menu that will surprise you. He will always ask first about the things you like and of course take into account any dietary restriction that you may have.100% recommende

I visited this beautiful place on August 29th, 2015. This is located in a beautiful area called Greenwood Avenue.As soon as you enter, you will see the warm and neat restaurant setup with the Kitchen running on one side.On the walls, you can see hand written stuff on boards that tell you - There is no menu here :) Please don't ask for it :)That is indeed the concept. No Menu.Chef Gabriel Frattini who also owns the restaurant, will come to your table to have a candid chat with you about what would you like to eat and your food preferences (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, allergic to anything, etc).He will take note of that and will inform you about what he has in store for us. He will usually cook one cold appetizer, one hot appetizer, main course and dessert for you :)They have a good collection of wines; if you're into that, you won't be disappointed.Gabriel visited our table again to check on us and if we're enjoying the food or not :)Such a great experience here.Ambiance : Lovely. Warm, Neat and welcoming. Italian Music plays in background.Service : Great. No complaints.Food : Mouth watering, delicious :)Cost : Such greatness does come with a good price (but totally worth it).It might get heavy on your pockets so, plan accordingly.I'll visit here again when I'm back in Singapore. For sure

My husband and I had a enjoyable experience! The "Chef " Gabriel Fratini cooked for us a scrumptious meal. He asked us if we had any allergies or what we like or don’t like eating and then he brought to the table an appetizing, fresh and mouthwatering meal. We were very impressed by the services and yummy food Fratini La Trattoria provides. Gabriel Fratini even helped us to select the wine for our meal. And his selection was Italian wines and it was divine! We recommend Fratini La Trattoria and we’ll definitely return! Thumbs up for Gabriel Fratini and his team

A truly wonderful little gem in Greenwood (off Bkt Timah Rd) - lovely little place run by husband and wife and the rest of their team. It is a food extravaganza and there is NO MENU - however, fear not that Chef Gabrielle will cater for all tastes and preferences even going to the point of cooking special individual portions for those who have food allergies / dietary limitations (medical/religious/or otherwise) or even if you are simply just a picky eater!! Nothing is Impossible at this great Italian - if only there were more places like it on the island!
5
I've always wanted to try some nice omakase style food in Singapore, and I was lucky enough to stumble upon this restaurant. As soon as I went in, I was greeted by Chef Gabriel who introduced the restaurant concept. Basically, it means that there is no menu and Chef Gabriel chooses the dishes that he will be serving for the day. What I type here won't do the food enough justice - the experience was just amazing. Chef Gabriel occasionally comes out to chat with us (and he has a great sense of humour too!), and the waiters are all serving us with a huge smile on their face. I have to warn you though that it won't come cheap (although it is definitely value for money!), so you might want to save up a bit before coming here! All in all, it was a great and unique experience and I would definitely want to come back here again
5
Great service and ambience! We were a big family group celebrating a birthday - the wine is excellent and we had great options for vegetarians as well.
5
Just visited the restaurant for my graduation dinner and we had an awesome time. Food was great and price was reasonable for the overall service and variety of food tasted. Will definitely visit again :)
5
No menu. Which I like surprises. Friendly staff. Excellent food and wine. Reservation is a must. I Can't wait to go back.
5
Service is excellent with the chef dishing out every course to you personally and you can provide your feedback to him. We were served by Lorenzo as Mr. Fratini was overseas. It was our first visit so we couldnt compare the culinary skills but we are happy with the food quality :) Thumbs up to Lorenzo!It is fun to be surprised with good food at every juncture! Our dinner menu of $90/pax consists of 4 cold appetisers, 4 hot appetisers, a main course of seafood pasta and 3 types of dessert. The cold appetiser is fantastic - the highlight of my meal!The deco is unpretentious - not too fanciful - nice, comfy and classy.I am impressed that Mr. Fratini paints and has his paintings on the walls. A multitalented man indeed
5
We really enjoyed the night out, food and atmosphere were great. The menu prepared for us was outstanding, with all fresh products served in original and mouthwatering dishes. Chef Lorenzo took very good care of us and truly transmitted his passion in every dish served. We'll definitely will be back!
5
I had heard a great deal about Fratini, therefore my expectations were high especially as it was my son and wife's birthday ; I am please to say that none of the party of eight were disappointed. Among the eight in the party, there was a mixture or vegetarians, non-fish eaters and meat lovers, the host efficiently established the dietary requirements and a deluge of fantastic dishes arrived over the course of an hour and a half.Superb food great atmosphere and a feeling that you and special.Great venue for a celebration

I wanted to start by stating that this place was overrated, but I really cant justify using the word since it was really disappointing. Although many reviews rate this place highly, after being to so many restaurants globally I struggle to think how this could be the case.First and foremost, here are the upsides:1) portion sizes are good, with the pasta plate being very filling especially.2) variety of dishes from seafood to poultry, with the short ribs in mash being commendable.Now the downsides:1) For the price, the quality of the ingredients was terrible. Most of the dishes' freshness was suspect. As a place that prided itself on seafood and produce straight from the market, the fish, prawns, squid, and even crayfish were not fresh. The scallops we had as well were not fresh. For this price, I think it should be a basic requirement.2) Substandard food. Some of the dishes were unimaginative and tasted pretty basic. This would probably be an indirect result of the quality and selection of ingredients available. Frankly, from this meal, it seemed like the establishment was really stingy with both ingredients and preparation3) Pairing of the ingredients was subpar. Examples include the passionfruit prawns, where the passionfruit simply was too overbearing and spoilt the dish. Most of the dishes were either too bland or two overbearing, with nothing in particular being exceptionally good.For travellers coming from overseas, I suggest not to stop here as there are a multitude of options around SEA that are much better. Sensi in Bangkok is a definite must try. For Singaporeans, I would recommend not coming to this place at all, as much as it pains me to say it. I am so extremely disappointed and think this place definitely does not deserve anywhere the score it has garnered till today

I usually don't rely on TA for my dining choices, especially in Singapore as I'm a local. However, I noticed Fratini when it was "only" no. 8 a few months ago. Based on the rave reviews from Italians, I felt that it was worth trying. And I'm so glad I did! I've put off eating Italian food for the most part since I've come back from a month and half trip to Italy last year. The food at Fratini reminds my wife and I the most of our time in Italy! The tasting menu was absolutely superb! And to top it off, the service was impeccable! I hope I'm wrong but I think it may be hard to find many other Italian restaurants (that charge much higher prices) that serve such authentic Italian food!

been a few times and always been happier when leaving than when i went in. i know that sounds bad but it means the experience made me happier! This is a sound chef with a long background in cooking Italian food and one who has spent many years in Asia ( i think it is over 20years, if i recall a conversation correctly). Also helped to set up the Fratini chain of restaurants in Brunei. Being Asianized, so to speak, he knows how to avoid the usual excesses and mistakes of just-migrated-to-another-country chefs who transfer cooking methods and ingredients en-bloc from home, forgetting that climate and local produce have a strong bearing on success. Forget about heavy creams in 36C ambient temperatures.Plus, the other big big difference between this restaurant and many others is that it is owned and run by a chef who is therefore the entrepreneur. Contrast this with the usual restaurant which is owned by an entrepreneur/corporation with no real background in food other than the desire to maximize profit. We need more such restaurants in Asia.Other pluses for Fratini- good location with a laid back feel although rapidly losing its laid back charm as singapore gets more crowded, good menu, good wine list, good service and very good ambience. Minuses- portion sizes are a bit big so you can forget about watching your calorie intake. Maybe he can start two menus ? a standard and a small ? then we can visit more often.Excellent pasta, cant be bette

~for Sat lunch my wife was asking me to choose between Bather's & Prime Society but I preferred somewhere close and has always been nothing short of great~Greenwood Avenue's valet parking is normally non-existent during lunch so we were luck to find a spot just in front of Fratini~without any prior reservations we walked in and was promptly asked if we'd any reservation but immediately after I said no, Gabriel appeared at the door with a B!G SMILE and said 'come in come in' and told the server to open the private dining room for us :0 !~quickly we were ushered past many tables filled with patrons to the back room near the kitchen, where the amazing VINO filled cellar is just simply breathtaking :)~my wife and I have visited Fratini, so has my family, and twice with colleagues but never had I had the honor of eating in the private dining room, words will be an injustice so photos will do nicely do check them out~Gabriel makes you feel like an old friend and I'd always loved his no menu system, he always cooks what's freshest from the market and we trust him to make a great meal of it every time, it's really heartwarming that's he's returned to Singapore to settle down after his kids are grown :)~Foodwise, 2 small appetizers, 4 small portions (always just a little too much more than I deserved to eat), a pasta dish then dessert. We skipped coffee/tea~Dish after Dish was delicious and other than desserts I'd be surprised if he served the same of anything more than 2 days in a row so just go get surprised, it's never disappointed before and with Gabriel I'd expect he has too much respect for his guests to ever serve anything less than delicious food~I'll definitely be back time and again whenever I want a surprisingly great meal :

Followed advice of friend and tried this place out. Had so much fun trying new food with great wine and a tremendous host/owner/chef. You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.
5
Food so delicious and staff very attentive. worth every penny i spent in this restaurant. i will definitely be back and recommend to my friends, family...
5
I had dinner there last night - 29 Jul 15 - with a good friend T. T held a dept dinner in Feb and was full of praise for the chef owner, Mr Fratini, and his food. The service and food did not disappoint last night. Mr and Mrs Fratini provided very warm and personal service, making me feel very welcome. Mr Fratini prepared the food to meet my requirements - no dairy and no truffles. Every dish was excellent, the prawn succulent and pasta superbly al dente. These were paired with a wonderful bottle of inexpensive red wine. I will definitely be back to the restaurant to enjoy the cosy ambience, wonderful food and lovely service
5
Very nice italian restaurant with a well executed and tasty homemade italian food. There is only one menu with 7 or 8 dishes, which changes depending on what the chief feels to cook on the day.Some dishes are very good, some are absolutely brilliant. I was particularly impressed by some delicious meat starters and by the ravioli pasta that were just legendary. The service is very good and the chief himself is very lively (he will surely come and chat with you to make sure that you enjoyed his food which is great way to get direct feedback from customer).Overall, a very unique in Singapore and tasteful restaurant that I definitely recommend
5
We went there first as a party of four of friends/family. Gabriel, the chef, introduced us to the way things work at his place: Sit back, relax and enjoy the food. And so it went, for a series of appetizers and dishes. I made the mistake of telling him I was hungry. I could barely move when we were done.The second time we went, less than a week later, it was just the two of us and Gabriel was able to sneak us in at the bar. After I related my concern about portion size to him, he said "I will make up in quality what you are not getting in quantity". We again had a fabulous meal, this time just the right amount.It is definitely a top 10 in my eyes, without the pretense
5
I had seen that this was Trip Advisor's no. 1 restaurant in Singapore so was ready to be impressed.... and our ladies table of 3 certainly were. It was surprisingly quiet but then the restaurant setting is in the Greenwood Ave area and it was a Tuesday eve. Gabriel was the perfect host. He proudly began by explaining there was no menu but he would create a meal for us. This was fine as we had far too much chatting to do to be distracted by menu selection. He proceeded to surprise and delight us with every course, from the selection of 4 starters to the yummy desserts. I cannot wait to return! Bravo
5
Just had an explosive flavorful dinner with complex taste in a very relaxing atmosphere. It was the best meal in Singapore so far. The element of surprised menu was definitely intriguing. The wine selection was extensive. The staffs were very knowledge, attentive and friendly but not stuffy. The qualify of the meal exceeded the price. Thank you for an awesome meal. Can't wait to go back.
5
Gabriel makes you feel like you are visiting him at his house. When a friend invites you for dinner usually you don't get to choose what to eat, rather you eat what you are served. That is exactly what it feels like to visit Fratini. But with a huge difference: Gabriel is a bona fide awesome chef. The food is very varied and consists of many small dishes. From the cold appetizers all the way to desert everything was fantastic. And he was able to match every dish with excellent Italian wine. Loved it, really loved it
5
We were met by Gabriel upon our arrival and shown to our table. He introduced us to the concept of his intriguing restaurant - where there is no menu and you simply have a selection of delightful dishes served to you. Your role is just to tuck in and enjoy the food and experience. The dishes range from a selection of appetisers, followed by a selection of meat and fish taste bites - followed by a pasta 'pan' (yes you are literally eating out a pan) and then a selection of desserts. All of which was delicious!The food selection was so tasty - and you go with the flow of the kitchen and service - removing some of the complexities of choosing your dishes. We complimented the dishes with an organic glass of Chianti - which worked very really with the dishes we had.The idea works very well - and it priced about right. We was a thoroughly enjoyable experience - the service was very attentive throughout the evening
5
The place was very homey and comfortable, their service was efficient and accommodating, a nice selection of wine to pair with the foods but there is No menu here however, Gabriel is exceptional! the food was very artistic and appetizing by the way it was plated and ofcourse... the taste was Impeccable! Good Job to the whole team!
5
The chef is clearly there to impress! Menu is not something you should expect. Rather be prepared for a gourmet experience as if you were visiting any of your friends.
Pots and pans will be on your table!

We had dinner with Gabriel last week. It was a great experience. Apart from being an awesome host and superb chef, the team were able to deal with a somewhat painful group (ie us) - one with garlic allergy, one vegetarian, one didn't like seafood....but they managed to create a fabulous dining experience for us all. Whilst keeping the repartee happening for us and the other guests the whole time.Why "only" 4 stars? The venue does not do justice to the rest of the experience. It would have been 4.5 if that was an option. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - we will be back
5
As I looked up 'Italian restaurants off the beaten track', Fratini La Trattoria popped up and the fact that they do not have a menu absolutely stoked our interest. Apparently the chef heads off in the mornings and shops the freshest produce and creates a unique degustation menu everyday. We couldn't resist such a culinary adventure and our taste buds were taken on a tantalising treat.The experience was perfect. The wine recommendations were spot on. We had amazing seafood antipasti, beef cheeks, short ribs, prawn fritters, seafood pasta and the classic tiramisu/panna cotta combo to wrap up. Every dish was well prepared and the flavours were intense and interesting. We had the best seats in the house and very attentive and genuine service by the owner himself, Gabriel Fratini. This has become our new favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore and will be back real soon

Everyone reviewing this restaurant raves about the food and service. They are definitely not lying. Fabulous. You are sharing with your mates a bunch of appetizers and progressing to the main pasta dish that is just out of this world (that is if you could somehow find any space left in your tummy). Then comes the dessert... for which by miracle you find some more space (especially Tiramisu is just heavenly). The host? In 10 minutes you feel like you knew they guy for the past 20 or 30 years and he is instantly an integral part of your dinning experience. Personally opening both bottles of wine and smelling corks also helped to cement that perception in our collective minds.Now let me tell you the drawbacks. Definitely a sauna room that they call Toilet needs to be experienced (heck is spotless but at about 40 deg C, you just want to run out of it quickly). Then there was a small table with two Japanese ladies. They were so loud that I could not hear my guests at our table. Then the miracle had happened - they got the first batch of food and... it shut them up. Guess, Gabriel's cooking transcend the borders and cultures (no serious, why Japanese women speak with such a high pitch tone of voice and ... why so loud?).Anyway, Fratini is now on my radar and I will visit it more often when visiting Singapore.Thanks Gabriel for having us at your table and sharing your vibrant persona with us
5
As a family of four, we went to Fratini's on the basis of other excellent reviews and it exceeded our expectations. Gabriel Fratini was a charming and welcoming host, gave us very attentive service, and dished up an amazing meal. The courses were exquisite but the environment was not pretentious, and our young children were made very welcome (the chef even performed magic tricks for them!). It was a very special evening and the best restaurant and food experience we had in Singapore.
5
I had spend 15 years in Singapore, I love the restaurants there, so when I return I choose past favourites. My business partner suggested Fratini, I immediately said no, hadn't heard of it and the chef choosing my food did not appeal to me. I went. Gabriel could not have been nicer in discerning what you eat or not eat, as an Irish man who does not eat potatoes he was particularly curious. When discussing wine and tastes, he suggested a Puglia wine that was magnificent, when I had said that I like Compania or Sicilian. The food, primarily fish was excellent. The starter family style of tapas like scallop, prawn, crab and lobster was excellent. Second course of beef, and potatoes for others was soft and smooth and the seafood fettuccine served in the pan it was cooked in was generous. I am a convert. I will be back each tri
5
We have been to Fratini many times and each time we have left thoroughly satisfied. Be warned that there is no menu, just tell Gabriel Fratini, the friendly owner-chef what you don't eat and leave the rest to him. The diversity of his tapas style creations will satisfy whatever food cravings you may have. And always leave some stomach space for the main course which comes at the end when you think you have eaten more than your fill
5
I've been to Fratini countless times. If you've a guest in town or someone you wish to have a nice chat with, Fratini is the place to come. Life is made easy with no menu and wine by the glass is always good. Owner Gabriel and wife Hui Ling are always friendly and you feel good when you enter their resto. After having a terrible Omakase at Dstllry, Fratini makes you feel money well spent! Staff are always polite though I've to point out their latest hire young boy seems clueless. When I read the post by Siew Wei L about how she was insulted by Gabriel comment, I feel sad that some people are so uptight. Smile! You're visiting a nice Italian resto, lovely ambiance, great host, and a vibrant place!One suggestion to bring it to a 6 star is having more variety

Heard so much abt this restaurant.. but the ratings fall way below what is being delivered.The chef welcome us after we were seated. He appears friendly in a not so professional way. He made a comment on " you were still a kid when i started cooking "That to me was uncalled for as i m still your customer after all. When ask abt the history or values of his restaurant, he replied in a rather swanky manner " let my food speak for itself"I also agreed with the previous comment on, since everybody is having the same menu, the price should be lowered.Most of his food were already pre-prepared in the day and just being reheated prior to serving.Our pasta dish was ravioli, which was served in a pan on the table, but it was cold. Akin, the ravioli just came out from the fridge and being put into sauce, heated up and serve to us.I m not impressed with the quality of the food. One of the meat dish, the beef cheek in brown sauce was poor, its like the sauce and the meat do not marry together. Its like the beef cheek was cook separately from the sauce rather than slow cook with the sauce to perfection. I will not recommend anyone to dine there. We paid $340 for dinner for 2 pax plus a bottle of prossecco. I have visited better italian restaurants in singapore with great service, professionalism and excellent food. Example, pepenero. Etna ristorante.Senso. Burattini. Bonnissimo.
5
After many visits in various places in the lyon city and being an italian expat I can say yes, Gabriel' Fratini restaurant is the best italian restaurant in the city. No fluffy menu, top quality ingredients used to serve simple but tasty dishes along with excellent wine. Bravo
5
If you want to go number 1 and enjoy best where menu is decided for you, go Fratini's. As we say in Oz - great tucker and you'd be a mug to miss it.
5
Authentic Italian food, I felt like in the north of Italy where food is extraordinary. Chef the best! An extraordinary admosphere. An extraordinary restaurant.
5
Can't wait to go to this restaurant again. Love the surprise food. The chef himself served us. He's really nice person, made us feel really comfortable eating there. The tiramisu also really good
5
Fratini is not just a restaurant, it represents the highest expression of how great Italian food can be. Chef, u simply are the best!
Un vero ristorante Italiano, un grande plauso a Chef Fratini orgoglio dell'Italia nel mondo.

Enter Gabriel Fratini chef-patron of newly opened Fratini La Trattoria at Greenwood Avenue. Set in a ground floor shop house space in the balmy Greenwood residential enclave, Fratini’s new roost is decidedly homey and casual, with an open kitchen lining almost the entire length of the wood-decked 20-seat dining room. Tucked away at the far end of the eatery is a 15-seat private room for family dinners or private functions. It’s a husband and wife team, with the husband of course, as the head chef. Both are sincere and welcoming without being invasive. There is no menu, the chef comes by your table, serves, and pair’s wines and otherwise opens up his restaurant like it's his personal kitchen at home and invites you in to sit down, enjoy and relax. Every dish is correctly portioned. All our dishes came just as we were finishing the last and the waiter introduced each one, which was great pacing. Wine is also reasonably priced. Expect classic Italian culinary finesse, tapas-style plating and a modicum of cool fielded by a spunky chef who confidently dispatches his prized catch from daily trips to the local market. A very enjoyable place, Overall a wonderful dining experience. It was expensive but everything in Singapore is. Highly recommend a visit
5
From booking the restaurant (to be told we had secured the last table) until the last mouthful of food - what a wonderful dining experience. The owners are delightful, run off their feet but still manage to make u feel so welcomed. Is the tiramisu recipe under lock and key!!!Will return definitel
5
Went by for a business lunch and had a very pleasant experience. Husband and wife team, with the husband as the head chef.He personally comes by the table to see if you have any food restrictions, then explains the (lack of a) menu and how it works.Then sit back, and enjoy your meal
5
Just visited Fratini and it's definitely the most-go choice in SG. Very nice ambience .. Traditional italian family restaurant (trattoria) a very cozy atmosphere with excellent food but nothing too extravagant. Love the seafood antipasti, the fatty beef with potato and pasta and tiramisu. And don't forget their wines: from white to red, cocktail with Campari, gin and vermouth is superb, sweet wine and grappa... Had an enjoyable night and will surely be back with friends :
5
I have never been disappointed with the outstanding culinary experience that Chef Gabriel and his team deliver. The food combinations brought 'wows' from our visiting friends. The kids loved the plates of homemade pasta. And the adults loved the wine recommendations. Cannot wait for my next visit.
2
All opinions (and tastes) are subjective and I can only say what I personally thought of this bistro which is: the service is great, the atmosphere is relaxed and the owner makes an effort to engage with his customers which is refreshing. The cold and warm mezze's were quite tasty although I found one of the fish dishes to be dry, the fried baby squid was delicious, the main pasta dish was very un-exciting and I was disappointed the pasta shells were not homemade or fresh, if I can make pasta at home it's expected of somewhere with such praise, furthermore I agree with another comment the main was warm and not hot despite being served in a pan. The tiramisu desert was delicious. As you've probably guessed I found the food overall to be average, however the bill was anything but average, a lunch for x2 came to around $150 (food and coffee only). When you look on the website/enter the bistro you are led to believe each dish is going to be tailored for you as there are no menus and no prices (except for the wine list). I'll be honest the lack of food prices kind of makes you feel awkward about asking or discussing before you eat, looking over at other diners plates it appears everyone is being served the same selection of dishes therefore pricing should be published or mentioned before you're seated (even at time of booking). One of the staff made a comment about it being reasonable to eat here for the quality of food but I disagree, as an example and there are plenty more in SG: we had lunch at Les Amis a few days before, 3 courses with freshly made bread, complimentary coffee & biscuits and a junior bottle of wine came to $170. That's $170 for lunch in a prime location at one of the best restaurants in Asia along with incredible food, service and setting
5
Was there with my girlfriend, lovely food at great prices. Their service was great as well, will definitely pay them another visit.
5
A must go for everyone who appreciates great personal services and loves deliscioys food. Thanks to Gabriel and the whole team for a fabulous experience.
5
We went for my hubby's birthday. They are such an amazing couple...fabulous service, food and concept. I can't recommend it highly enough!
5
Great food, excellent service, sociable host - and the absence of a menu is the defining touch. Nothing better than letting the chef decide what is the best choice in the restaurant.
4
The food was very good and the service excellent. Very pleasant place to eat. Thought overall the bill was a bit high, but maybe I am getting out of touch with prices.
5
We were invited to a Sunday lunch with friends that were regulars. Their description of the food and wine was quite accurate, but inadequate to describe the amazing variety of endless food that continued arriving at our table. The meals were presented in such a fashion that I took many photos, something I rarely do. Words and pictures do not have the sufficiency to describe my dining experience. Possibly the most expensive meal I can remember, but I cannot wait for my next visit to Singapore to enjoy this gastronomic adventure with Chef Gabriel Fratini and his staff.
5
Another wonderful meal! Fresh, creative and above all delicious.Today, I believe is my 5th visit and again he has been consistently presented dish after dish of perfection. I never wrote a review before and I said I should. More people should enjoy Chef Gabriel's creations. Mr and Mrs Fratini is friendly, attentive and I would be back again very soon
5
Then you've found the right place! We enjoyed a great evening after a long hard-working week.The food was very delicious. We enjoyed every creation that was served. There is not much more to say than: Thank you to Gabriel, his wife and the team for a wonderful evening!We'll definitely be back on our next business trip
5
"Don't ask for a menu, we don't have one" the message is clear enough and the idea is brilliant. Once sitted the chef comes to your table and asks what you like/dislike and then cook for you some cold appetizers followed by warm ones then a pasta dish and some dessert. Everything is nicely presented, absolutely delicious and plentiful !!! The staff is so so nice and friendly, chatty and actually you feel very much at home.We had a great night and we make sure to come back for some more surprises :

I brought my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday. I had chosen this place as I wanted us to go somewhere out of the norm of downtown and wanted it to be personal (not so commercial). Success! We arrived at the restaurant and Chef Gabriel immediately walked towards us to greet us personally. He did not even ask for the name of the reservation, he immediately knew who we were. He sat us at our table and told us that this was a no menu restaurant. We should advise him if we have any dietary restrictions and we informed him that we do not eat pork. He subsequently brought the first dishes for the cold appetizers. There were 4 different small dishes (2 of each). This was then followed by hot appetizers, with also 4 different small dishes (2 of each). Each little dish was beautifully presented and well explained by either Chef or his Sous Chef. Both of these sets of appetizers were wonderful! It had a variety of foods including beef and lamb, scallop, pumpkin, peppers etc. So many flavours and all just so good! Then Chef Gabriel brought us our main: Seafood angel hair spaghetti. He brought the food out in its pan! Felt so home like and comfortable. And it tasted just soooooo good! We absolutely loved it. To top it off, Chef Gabriel prepared a tiramisu which was covered with hardened sugar as a sort of 'galaxy'. Hard to describe but beautiful and certainly a surprise. It's not a cheap place but it's not over prices for the quality or service and food. We had a great experience and would certainly go back!
5
We didn't meet Gabriel but the food was still good. We like the ravioli and the dessert selection. The presentation of the food was simple...which is good as they would probably charge more.
4
good collection of wine,if you like sea food with an italian twist this sure is the place to look around.
5
Chef Gabriel definitely delivers authentic Italian food as promised. Fresh produce, friendly and efficient service. The no menu idea lets you enjoy the best of the day and the wines can be matched perfectly. Its a shame to leave coming here for a special occasion!

Had an amazing dinner with an local business partner on my trip. Since i was in singapore only for three days so i didnt wanted to take risk so decided to dine in seeing number 1 rank on tripadvisor.
5
Freshest produce used, creative and delicious!
No menu, the chef surprises and impresses you with his delicacies. Highly recommended!
4
It is indeed a nice restaurant with excellent ambience.
The food sometimes are not very tasty and the quantity is small. The food is also too costly!
5
Celebrated my father's birthday at Fratini La Trattoria in May and loved every moment of the experience! Chef Fratini and his wife are perfect hosts providing attentive service yet giving diners their space and time to enjoy the array of dishes prepared. We had delicious cold apps, hot apps, pasta and dessert. The absence of a menu makes the experience even more fun and allows diners to try dishes and flavors they may not have gone for, if given a menu. Definite repeat and highly recommended
4
No menu - And that's just the clever part. Each course was fresh and thrilling as the next. We started on this engaging culinary experience with 4 cold and 3 warm starters; yellow tail, crab, salmon, cod, beef and lamb. The main dish was a most delicious short trofie pasta with crayfish and prawns cooked in a piquant tomato based sauce, light enough that i want to drink it. The Latunella sauvignon blanc accompanied all our meals delightfully. What also made the ambience so enjoyable was the witty and engaging Chef Gabriel who was present throughout the evening. The service was attentive and simply great. Will be back soon
4
Went to this casual, family restaurant for lunch last Sat. Impressed by the "surprises". Small portions of a variety of tasty food from starters to main courses to desserts. Enjoyed every single one of them. Think their "no menu" idea is pretty cool as long as the surprises are good. Save us the time of making decisions. The price is also reasonable for the variety we can try
5
Visited this restaurant back in March 2015 after doing research in Tripadvisor for a good restaurant to have birthday dinner with a friend. I was not disappointed! This restaurant is well known for its no-menu settings and you wouldn't know what dish would be served next. And woala I was surprised and happy with the dishes. Do not need to worry you may bump into food you do not like as the chef would ask you upfront what food/meat/fruit you do not eat. Dishes would be prepared with any fresh ingredients they could get that day.The chef was very welcoming and humorous so just sit back and relax to enjoy your food! Those food come together like a musical play, one after another to be devoured by you. For people who likes sweet moscato, I would recommend Zagara Moscato D'asti
5
Simply the best lunch I have had in Singapore for the last 2 years. It was great not to have a menu or need to choose but instead have the chef just bring what he felt we would like. Delicious.
5
An incredible eating experience. Each course was beautifully presented and great flavor!
Loved the idea that we could just relax and look forward to the culinary surprises to come.
Expensive but worth treating yourself
5
Food was delicious, from the various starters to the main course, deserts were amazingly good (tiramisu definitely the best in singapore, no doubt).Gabriel, the chef was a wonderful host, the quality of service was impecable.Fratini is definitely the restaurant to eat authentic italian cuisine
5
What an experience! We often visit this little enclave of nice restaurants in a bit of an off the track residential area of Singapore. The whole area has a nice ambience. Anyway, we'd seen Fratini's and decided to give it a try. It is a totally different concept to most restaurants as it has no menu. You are completely in the Chef's hands, although he did ask about our preferences prior to the beginning of the food. I won't spoil the surprise of what you are treated to during dinner, suffice to say that every morsel was delicious and we left feeling absolutely replete. It is a delight for a change not having to make a decision about what to choose! We will definitely be back. I would recommend booking as we we're dining early, and even so the restaurant was fully booked and passing trade was (very pleasantly) turned away
5
Singapore's food is good but most of dishes are cooked with a lot of garlic which I don't like too much so during our quick 4 days staying for business I asked to my husband to find a nice Italian Restaurant, we got casually into Fratini Restaurant, just looking on google...Fratini is an Italian long experienced Chef, He cooked for famous people like Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson... Is is an artist too! So you can try his nicest dishes with Italian Ingredient and Singapore fishes decorated and mixed with his super creativity
4
As we enter the restaurant, you'll see Chef Gabriel welcoming the guests, and eventually coming to your table to ask for dietary restrictions or anything you don't eat as they do not have a menu as you would have read from all the other reviews.According to the boards displayed in the restaurant, the ingredients are sourced from the market freshly everyday, so I guess you can expect some difference in every visit. I guess that's the excitement.The food were absolutely delicious and we like their idea for presentation, simple and intimate. I wouldn't say the service was top notch, apart from Chef Gabriel and the manager, they were very hospitable. Overall, we are very happy with our new Sunday hang outs that we are sourcing and will definitely be back again
5
Lunch at Fratini La Trattoria was nothing short of a Masterpiece created by an Artist.An experience not to be missed by food lovers while in Singapore. The Degustation menu reveal the creativity of Chef Gabriel's dedication to find the freshest ingredients available and creating them into dishes of the highest possible quality. Our meal ended with the best tiramisu and panna cotta we have ever had. To accompany your meal the restaurant have an extensive wine list of great wines from Italy.Unforgettable experience
5
We decided after some consultation to try this nice restaurant which is situated slightly outside the center of Singapore. We were greeted by the Chef ,Mr Gabriel himself, which informed us that there is no need to ask for a menu since there is none available. Instead we were promised 4 cold starters, 2 warm starters, 1 main course and 4 deserts. On top we were recommended to choose a fantastic Merlot from his own village. The food and the wine was extraordinary and we had a very special evening with the friendly team. Gabriel knows his profession and we were enjoying fantastic culinary moments. If you want something special don't hesitate . You will have the reward. Gudrun and Lennar
5
What makes this restaurant special is the combination of great food, attentive service, and personalized attention from the chef to each table, which was especially important given the omakase concept of the restaurant. Chef Gabriel took the time to get to know our preferences, including that of my 8-year-old daughter. He customized the menu as well as the serving size to suit our table. The result was one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a restaurant. The food was delicious and beautifully presented, in portions that were just right. The restaurant's atmosphere was warm and friendly. In short, everything worked well together to make dining here a wonderful experience
5
We saw this place on trip advisor and wanted to try it. And after 3.5 years in Singapore we can absolutely recommend this resturant as a super experience. They have no menu, but prepares a super menu based on your personal preferences. We will definitely come back! Our daughter on 7 years did also enjoy the pasta they recommended.
5
Such amazing service from Gabriel, and such delicious food. Enjoyed every moment of this experience ! The food is so flavorsome and beautiful. Thanks for having us!
4
Very decent portions for the price.
Quick service...staff know what dishes to recommend...good value for money...
5
Fantastic meal, excellent food served tapas style and without a menu. Flavours were excellent and portion sizes spot on given how many different dishes served. Menu was slanted towards seafood which was excellent although a little more red meat would have been welcome. Deserts were also served on a tasting platter, and were great. Wines by the glass were well priced and very complementary to the food.As good as the food was, the service from Gabriel and staff turned a very good meal into a great one. So nice to see such a high level of engagement and enjoyment from those running a restaurant.  We can't wait to go back!
5
I know Gabriel Fratini for more than 30 years but I never had the opportunity to taste his cuisine .I had the chance to repair this mistake recently on a visit to Singapore and I went to his restaurant with a friend .The place is a bit far from the center of Singapore , in a peaceful residential area with several other italian restaurants around .We had the menu degustation which was a gastronomic experience .The assorted starters were delicious offering variety including a very good dish of octopus and another fine preparation of scallops , the fried squids were light and tasty and the parpadelle with sefood sauce very good too and we also enjoyed the desserts and a good Rosso di Montalcino .On top of this good dinner the very fiendly athmosphere and the kindness of Gabriel and of his wife have made the evening very pleasant and an unforgettable experience .Encore Bravo Gabriel and we hope to see you again soon

In the words of Gabriel - its Omakase Italiano style! I made a reservation for my brother's birthday treat in March. Omakase is perfect - being most indecisive when it comes to food as often times I end up ordering too much food! Before we start Gabriel was at our table asking about allergies and religious dietary restrictions. The food were nicely presented and wait wasn't too long - we were prepared its going to be somewhat fine dining. Food were nicely portioned to the number of pax, we were served 4 different types of entrees for a start. Then main course followed by pasta and 3 different types of desserts. We like that there were good variety of seafood, poultry, carbs and sweets. In order not to give the surprise away, I will only state a generic caption in the photos. Service was friendly and attentive.Location - not convenient, accessibility is not an issue if you drive & I see valet parking available. If you're not driving, please take a cab. We chose to walk out after our hearty dinner, the 15 mins walk out to the main road is certainly helpful
5
I was in Singapore in March and was invited for dinner on my last evening. We were going for Italian which is a always good . You can always trust the locals, in this case, my friends,Klaus and Sriya to take you to the best places. It was my first time to Fratini La Trattoria and I was very happy with the atmosphere - it was very cozy and the variety of the foodis well thought out and the service is spot on. Will definitely make a trip there wheneverI am in Singapore next. A word of warning though, do make a booking. I noticed that theplace was fully booked and throughout the evening, there was not a vacant table
5
This is our third visit to the restaurant and this restaurant never cease to excite us. The food quality and standard was always kept at its highest and service was never compromised. Chef Gabriel is very creative in his dishes and is always able to accommodate to the customers needs.Both cold & hot appetizers were well executed in terms of taste and presentation. We had the homemade pork ravioli with pistachio sauce as main this afternoon, OMG! this is simply the BEST ravioli we have ever had in our life! The skin was soft, thin and has a nice elasticity, the filling was well seasoning and cooked perfectly. Oh, the pistachio cream sauce is the most amazing sauce in all the land! It's rich, creamy and the pistacios add a nice crunch.. absolutely perfect balance of flavours!Will definitely return for more surprises. I give it 6 stars
5
I had the chance to visit this restaurant thanks to my cousin.Too many good things to say about this place, I don't even know where to start..Let's say as an Italian I expect extraordinary food quality whenever I visit an Italian restaurant, and Chef Gabriel was able to satisfy every single expectation.He is a nice, friendly and professional man who runs his business with his lovely wife.His cooking skills are simply excellent!The atmosphere is charming , staff friendly and ready to assist you whenever you need.Best thing to keep in mind:They don't have a food menu.It means they only serve fresh products!Amazing wine selection too.Definitely a place you MUST try when you are in Singapore.Can't wait to go back
5
Gabriel (the chef) showed great dedication to all his dishes. Expect a meal of the unexpected. The menu is dependent on what is freshest in the market that day. Gabriel would personally go down to choose his ingredients and creatively come up with dishes that could complement each other, and were worthy enough to be in either the lunch set or the dinner set. I went there twice (both lunch) because of separate celebrations, and they were both an eye opener to the culinary world. From the appetizers, to the sides, to the main (both times were pasta), and to the totally amazing desserts, it left me craving for more. Of course, not knowing what the next dish was also added to the excitement. And the next dish always comes out better than the previous dish. And normally, by the time the pasta is served, I was already quite full, yet the pasta (which if i remember correctly) was homemade and really delicious. Also, don't worry if you have allergies and cannot be in control of the dishes that are coming out for the set. One of my friends could not eat eggs and raw seafood and he totally catered a dish specially for her. I suppose if you state your allergies up front, it would really help avert any unwanted disaster. Gabriel was also very friendly in making sure everything was going well. All in all, it was a really wonderful experience
5
Putting oneself in the hands of a chef ie no menu has its dangers. However, Chef Gabriel and his team surpass expectations with their creative dishes cooked from freshly sourced ingredients. Unexpectedly flavours eg salmon sashimi with wholegrain mustard, porkbelly with a tuna sauce. The wine cellar is extensive and its worth taking the chef's recommendation. This restaurant suits a large corporate group, to friends and an intimate evening a deux. Excellent value for money
5
Im a food lover and experiment all around the world.
This is one of my came back ever i back.
Love it
5
No menu - you get what Gabriel offers and it was excellent and different Italian food. Go there as soon as possible but it will not be cheap!
5
The ingenuity that goes in to the dishes is what really makes this restaurant stand-out. There are no menus, Gabrielle simply asks what types of food the customers likes and then individually prepares these unique and exciting dishes. You are never quite sure how the dishes will be served but they are unique and appear almost exclusively crafted to the diners tastes.This is not traditional Italian fare, it high quality, fresh ingredients that would be used in Italian cooking but presented in a way that surprises.Very well worth a visit and the food and wine prices are extremely reasonable
4
We booked a table at Fratini after reading the good reviews at Tripadvisor. We had a group of 10 and managed to get the private room at the back which is ideal for a small group. There is no menu; instead chef Gabriel takes you on a culinary journey. It is not easy to describe all the food we had because it consisted of many small portions but it certainly was full of nice surprises.Personally I would not have mind to have a slightly larger portion of the main course or a 2nd surprise (probably because I did not have lunch). The service at Fratini is great, not just the staff but also chef Gabriel himself who personally introduces all the dishes. And of course his lovely partner who made sure that our group had a fantastic evening. Surely we will come back

Unlike the experience of others, the restaurant did not meet the high expectations I went in with. That said, still a good choice for quality Italian food if you are not concerned by price.Service: Excellent! The chef and host put considerable effort towards making sure their guests are happy.Food: Very Good. The food was consistently prepared well but the actual dishes ranged from average to very good on taste. Presentation was excellent.Value: Average - at $90+tax+service I would have been happy had I left full, but did not. To be fair, traditional Italian meals often have a lighter dinner, but an hour after eating I felt like I needed to go for a 2nd meal (I'm not a heavy eater either!)Atmosphere: Nice place, but very noisy, to the point where conversation was difficult to impossible at times. My throat was a bit soar after due to all the yelling over dinner...so unfortunately an average rating due to that. Decor is good, feels very authentic!My companion's independent take was that it was a decent place, and estimated the price to be roughly half of what I paid. Unfortunately, we will not likely be returning and the 4* rating is generous
2
From the get go the chef asked what we don't eat and I said shell fish. Pretty much every dish we were offered had shell fish in it. The main was pasta with bugs. I also feel to dish up a pan of pasta for the four of us to share was fairly unexciting when there's such hype around this place. We also drank an Italian red which was not great either. We were dining with a wine importer who described the nose as barnyard. We shall not be back for such big bucks. The decor needs serious attention. There is no atmosphere sorry to say.
5
Tripadvisor ratings set the expectation high but the experience exceeded what we counted on. Initially we were a bit puzzled since they don't have a menu but instead the owner - Gabriel - chat with us about what we would like to eat. Me and my wife went for seafood while our older son got meat menu and younger a delicious pasta. once clear about what we want the feast started. we got set of appetizers, first course, pasta and finished with delicious dessert. everything was like best home made Italian specials. we traveled many times to Italy and dined in some of the best restaurants there and I can testify that Gabriel's kitchen comes among the top of them. great food, great atmosphere! we surely will be back with some friends. thank you Gabriel for hosting us
5
Not just one of the best meals that I can ever remember, but one of the most enjoyable evenings I've had in a restaurant. The food itself is of stunning quality. It's inventive, delicious and memorable. The personal touch and the joy that Gabriel clearly gets in making his customers so happy makes this a very special place to eat
5
When I think of my ideal restaurant I always entertain the fantastical idea of a chef who can read my mind and conjure up dishes that I love to eat !Well Chef Gabriel attempted that here in Fratini Trattoria and I must say succeeded !This place requires you to not just be interested but actually intrigued since they don't have a menu - no not even a degustation menu - it's a prix fixe offering that the Chef conjures up each day - so in effect it's a bit like private dining at the chefs table for every table ! Now that's interesting and intriguing !It's a small place but with very good attention to detail. You will have the chef himself come over to have a chat and understand your preferences and dislikes.Then you sit back order some wine and enjoy the food. It is quite a lot of food and all of very high quality. Now you have to trust the chef and enjoy whatever he cooks as a piece of cooking artistry.I do wish is Gabriel have some more vegetarian options as Italian food had so much to offer there like the beautiful caponnattas and eggplant dishes ! I think the price is extremely reasonable for a full multi course degustation experience and the service is superb. I have dined elsewhere half as good with prices multiples of what Gabriel prices it at - and I do hope Fratini can keep it like this - it makes it a memorable and affordable luxury !The wine list is good and you have a nice selection of Italian wines including some nice ones by the glass.All in all a place that is almost up there when you think special Occassion ! Sometimes I think I would return more often if Chef Gabriel offered an A La Carte option but then would this place be so very special ? As the chef said a menu is meant to confuse , trust the chef !
5
After my 1st visit on last December, I came back to Singapore two weeks ago and have spent my entire 3 dinners there. Chef Gabriel just kept making those excellent and delicious meals that I can't help but be there every night! I've been looking for the right & proper words to express my feeling of the experience that I've in his restaurant. Unfortunately,I just couldn't find one that can match my true feeling of gratitude for the servings that were being prepared by Chef Gabriel!However there's something that I can share here,the "HEAT" is always ON when you're in Fratini La Trattoria!Meaning "Happy Eating,Amazing Taste" !!
5
Absolutely unique in every way. Exquisite dishes prepared by a culinary artist. We are regulars and look forward to every visit to experience chef Gabriel 's mouthwatering creations. Excellent wine selection, charming and relaxed ambiance. Our favorite restaurant in Singapore by far.
4
Went there with my lawyer for a quick lunch. There is no menu in the restaurant and the Chef just played the magic on what is having. It is simply just freshly delicious and also it was very reasonably priced.Would definitely come back again.
5
Chef Gabriel never fails to amaze us with his great food. Who needs a menu when anything they serve is delicious...anyone who loves good food should give it a try. You will leave the restautant with no regrets.
5
There's no menu and chef prepares the meal with ingredients at hand. Was pleasantly surprised by the variety g generous portions.
Set lunch $45 and set dinner $85.
HIghly recommended.

Good service and attention by staff n owner. Lovely couple and their warm hearted characters made the meal all the better. Meal gets better as the next dish comes.
5
As regular visitors for many years to Singapore and having enjoyed the excellent choice of so many great restaurants, we dined for the first time at Fratini's in Hillcrest Park last night. We enjoyed a truly memorable evening, receiving a warm welcome from proprietor and chef Gabriel Fratini and his wife Leng. Every superb dish was a delight. We cannot recommend this exceptional dining experience more highly. We will return next time we are over from the UK
5
This is our 5 or 6th visit and it was "simply outstanding". Food - it's an adventure , each and every dish is a surprise and we have never been disappointed Ambience- how it should be , fun Wine - spoilt for choice . The Barolo we had was very well priced and great quality The hosts - Mr and Mrs Fratini are the second reason we keep coming back. Gracious, engaging and personable . If you want a meal to be an experience then look no further .... Our favorite restaurant in singapor
5
Not a fan of the usual fare served up in "Italian" restaurants, so was intrigued to hear of an Italian restaurant (in Singapore) without a menu....it did not disappoint. The food was beautifully presented, deep in taste and quality. The food is served a little like a tasting menu, with a different surprise at each course. The evening we dined, there was definitely a sea food theme, but I love seafood. Perhaps more vegetarian or meat dishes would appeal to a wider audience, Gabriel? Nevertheless, we were all delighted by the food and the friendly, yet not intrusive, welcome and service of the staff. Not unreasonably priced for Singapore. Definitely recommended. Bravo on delivering an innovative dining experience in Singapore
5
We had a party of 10, 4 adults and 5 teenage boys and 1 teenage girl. It was the best meal of our 10 day holiday to Singapore and Penang. Chef Gabriel was so accommodating of our one fussy eater. The food was just sensational and memorable. We have been home for 2 weeks now and I am still thinking about all the amazing tastes we experienced that night.We will definitely visit again when we are in Singapore next.Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys beautifully prepared & presented food.Holiday Visitor Perth, Western Australi

Wow...I did not expect such an experience. I had heard this place was good, but did not expect how great it was. I expected a typical Italian restaurant like many in Singapore, with a wide range of pasta, antipasti and mains on the menu. There was no menu except the wine list. Instead of a menu, Gabriel the owner told us to trust him. So we did. And he did not let us down.He first asked what each of us could not eat. Then off he went to create. Instead of the usual bread to dampen our hunger, he served chopped roast pork belly as a started while we waited for the main offerings. This was followed by a couple of rounds of different antipasti offerings, the first were cold and the second were hot. They were all delicious. They included shrimp, crab, salmon, mushroom, fish, squid and others prepared with different sauces and toppings. He made sure that for me, who is allergic to seafood, there was a fish or chicken alternative when the shrimp and crap offerings were The wine was an excellent Barolo that fit perfectly with the meal. The evening naturally ended with an excellent dessert of a papaya smoothie in a shot glass, tiramisu on a large spoon and a small dish of spicy chocolate mousse. The latter was intriguingly tasty.I will return
4
The pasta was very good and probably the best I've had in Singapore for a while. The appetizers are not good though and I'll place them in the "fusion but neither here nor there" category.
5
Gabriel greets every single guest and the food dished out is unique and exquistie.
A superb wine list accompanies the food and the attentiveness of gabriel, his wife and the staff makes this place fully worthwhile
5
We previously reported on our great experience at Fratini's and have gone back four times in the last year, two celebrations, a business lunch with Clients and most recently their special Christmas Eve dinner. Gabriel and Leng are great hosts and continue to make the meal an enjoyable and interactive experience that includes ongoing explanations about the food, comments about a wide variety of topics and enquiries to ensure that you are enjoying your meal. It is at the very top of our list of favorite restaurants
5
Eating at Fratini is not just about good fresh food cooked by an excellent chef. It is an awakening of jaded palates and senses as one enjoys course after course of delightful light and lovingly created morsels to a plate of yummy pasta that looks so simple but tastes so heavenly and desserts so light and yet decadent!This must be my 6 or is it 7th visit and each time I am delighted by the friendly and attentive service. The friendly banter as if we are welcome into the home of Mr and Mrs Fratini. Today, I asked for a special lunch to be served as a farewell lunch for a dear friend. It was a celebration of friendship. I have had their delicious regular lunches and dinners and today was special as it was for good friends. Gabriel did not disappoint! White Asparagus wrapped in salmon sashimi and dusted with powdered caviar.......a melt in your mouth roast pork and saving the crackling for the last crunchy bite!succulent crayfish flesh tossed in angel hair pasta with julienned zucchini.......tiramisu! yums!I have not been disappointed each time I decide to make a visit to Fratini
5
Fratini was recommended by some of our Italian friends, so we had high expectations. From the moment you do your booking to the point when you have finished your meal, you know this is a owner operated restaurant. Keen attention to detail, the staff is well trained, and the tasting menu is a delight, and I do not say that often. The 3 small deserts just above average, but my wife loved them, but the rest of the menu was a nice change to the normal Italian food in Singapore, and easily rate 5 stars. Highly Recommended. I will certainly come again! The prices for the tasting menu and the excellent wines by the glass were all very reasonable and very good value
5
I am difficult to please when it comes to food because of my Italian background. Let's say I was spoiled with amazing restaurants in my life and I have to say that Fratini's meals never disappoint me. The fusion of Italian ingredients mixed with unconventional ones makes it unique, delicate and delicious. The thrill of not knowing what's on the menu makes it even more unique. Always looking forward to the next visit.
5
This quirky restaurant does not have a set menu and it changes according to what Gabriel can find in the market. We have been there twice and there were some repeats but generally we got a good share of new dishes too. We love the little serving / tasting portion. Each little set has so much flavor you can tell the food is lovingly and slowly prepared. The combination of sweet, savory, spicy etc all works with each other in the little dishes. It's a amazing burst of flavour in each mouthful. The only disappointment we had was the tiramisu. Both times we had this and on both occasions we felt it was tad dry. Maybe a splash of liquor will address this. This restaurant's pricing is on the high side but we are definitely going back again when we have a reason to celebrate!
5
The minute that we walked in,Gabriel and his lovely wife immediately made us feel like having dinner in a good friend's home! The food was very tasteful and exquisite, very detailed in serving.You could really feel that the food was being well prepared and cooked with love and passion!I've already looking forward to come back and have dinner in this lovely restaurant! If there's a thing that I wanna complain about, it's their price is unreasonably reasonable!!! Simply the best!!
3
We went for a birthday party with 5 adults and chose the tasting menu. We were looking forward to authentic Italian cuisine as we had good experience some one year ago but was surprised that many dishes are not authentic Italian but more Asian style of cooking, except for the main course which was a huge pan of pasta that tasted very normal. Though the foods were tasty and quite nice but we would rather go to a Chinese restaurant for such foods. We went there to taste authentic Italian cuisine and not something else. Was a disappointment in this respect
5
We recently had the good fortune to dine at this remarkable restaurant . We were a bit daunted by the lack of a menu but the TripAdvisor reviews seemed to justify the risk.I also know how having to cater for vegetarians can be a pain in the neck but with a bit of notice Gabriel provided easily the best vegetarian meal we have had in any of the 50+ countries we have visited.Rarely does anyone make the sort of effort to be as creative as Gabriel, and he clearly enjoys it.The result was simply fantastic. It was so good we returned for a second "experience" three nights later in our six day stay. The second occasion proved that the first night was not just a fluke. The white truffle pasta served on night two must go down as a masterpiece.If I could give a six star rating I would
4
Chef presented every course, made provision for the little ones ( though full price was charged) . Food made with much care and pride. Not cheap, but worth the time and expense.
5
The moment the charsmatic chef Gabriel greets you, you can tell this will be an amazing experience. A rare thing to think that you are being catered for as an individual but that's exactly how you will feel from the moment you walk in the door. I rushed here from the airport on the back of some great reviews and was not disappointed. My first experience of eating out in Singapore and I'm afraid nobody will be able to step-up and surpass, I think I've set the bar very high here. The wine was delicate and a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked fare set before me. I lost count of the appetisers and felt each one was a challenge to the next. Forget your expectations, forget yourself and enjoy
4
This spot probably serves the best Italian food in the city. Chef Fratini is a master in creating meticulously prepared dishes and cohesively presenting them in a singular menu. Service is warm, discreet and professional. Considered expensive for a Singaporean restaurant but you could pay a lot more if this was in New York or London
5
Mmmm..I am still feeling warm about the meal I had an hour ago. Gabriele and Leng have it all happening.Gabriele runs a kitchen from scratch. He will tell you what he has and will ask what you cant eat (in my case - muscles, abalone and other filter feeders). He braised my daughters salmon so it wasn't raw also.Leng keeps things moving and recommended an Abbruzi red which was great. She is such a charmer.You can see the love in their faces. Just look at the facebook page - Gabriele loves to cook and make people happy, Leng loves to keep it moving along with great wine and service and they are just gold as a married couple. Bravo to them!!Oh I forgot to talk about the food.....wow....yes... wow...One of the top ten meals I have eaten! The pork was mouth watering.Greenwood is famous for almost good restaurants - FRATINI is a STAND OUT. Not cheap but you can blame the landlords there. My idea of heaven is to live on an Island where these guys run the local.....I am so coming back...

It began well with some great starters... the salmon carpaccio, chicken parmigiana, the aubergine, and the lamb on a bed of mushrooms were particularly memorable. The chef/ proprietor came around to note the dietary restrictions of my group, and cooked accordingly. The food was paired with some fine Marialunga Barolo which worked like a dream. The mains of seafood pasta in a tomato base were much appreciated too. The desserts unfortunately were a tad disappointing. The service was very warm and friendly and the chef came round on a number of occasions to find out how we were doing.All in all, my group of 8 thoroughly enjoyed the lunch and thought that we would return soon. If you go in a big group don't forget to ask for their nice little private room.Congratulations on a fine job Gabriele

As I am the "Set Lunch Man" I have seen the ups and downs of these ideas in SQ.This is a unique experience for lunch and I will try for Dinner sometime soon. No menu, just chalkboards with todays specials. Chef/owner Gabriel asked if I could eat anything, as to make sure I don't die on the table top! Tapas? I've never seen such creations, from Salmon, to Tuna, to Calamari, to Prawns and Pork belly. I ate them al,l such fusion of flavours tremendous.Then quick switch of plates, and then a Seafood Pasta came with salmon, prawns, squid, prawns in rigatoni pasta cream whatever sauce! I'm so stuffed likea da ravioli now, and he brings me fluffy tiramisu in a giant spoon, so you just take it all in, And fresh peach sorbet too. It's a $45 treat for Lunch, but well worth it. Great Job Chef Gabriel, when the Chef serves it to you, enough said about the service

We were apprehensive about dining here, as even though I was excited to try out the "surprise" (no menu, up to the chef to decide on what is good / fresh for the day), I was also worried that I might not enjoy the meal as I do not classify myself as a extremely adventurous foodie. Maybe it was my lucky day, as Chef Fartini served us lots of dishes with mushrooms & seafood - 2 of my fav. ingredients. Absolutely loved the ingenious way of matching unlikely ingredients - salmon sashimi with sweet potato? I enjoyed every single dish that he whipped up (especially the cold dish and I am not even a fan of cold dish). By the time the pasta came, we were so stuffed that we had difficulty finishing it. We even had to ask them to hold off from serving the dessert too quickly, so that we had enough "room" to stuff it in.Absolutely worth every single cent we paid for. Just go for it. You definitely won't regret it. P/S - You should make a reservation before hand, as Chef Fartini told us that he sometimes closes the restaurant when he travels. Reservation is also recommended since this is a very small restaurant, with limited seating capacity

There is no menu n be prepared to be surprised by Chef Gabriel Fratini 6-course set dinner menu at $80++ is quite value for moneyI am still looking for a place which serve seafood rivioli in Spore n Gabriel say he will mk it specially for me if I tell him ahead

I'm guessing on the romantic dinner bit, but the girls and I agree that it would be perfect! The restaurant is small and cosy, and reservations are a must. I went with some girlfriends for a catch up lunch and couldn't have picked a better place. The food is simple, fresh, and delicious. There is no menu so Chef Fratini personally checks on any food allergies/issues, and then disappears into the kitchen, periodically sending out tasting portions of his creations. I love it - no decisions to make on what to dar, I can concentrate on the company and the food.

Multi-talented Chef Fratini who is also a painter cooks up a storm at his eponymous restaurant. The service was excellent and Fratini was an excellent host. The food was delightful - the menu; Italian omakase at the hands of a master chef. And also prices offered very good value

The food here is ALWAYS fresh from the market everyday. The chef and his wife are both FRIENDLY, and you have to admit, anything they serve is the best.

A birthday celebration for my wife after her actual birthday was spent the day before flying between USA and Singapore. The owner Gabriel is a very attentive and charming host and very welcoming of children. He provides a degustation style meal with a main course and dessert at the end, but with no menu. The wines are even his choice but can provide particular styles if requested. The pork belly starter was outstanding and set the tone for the many courses to come. After the typical Singaporian + +'s the total bill for 4 including five glasses of very good wine was just under $500, so don't go there if you are looking for a cheap night out. But I have paid about twice the nominal $85 + + per head (kids eat the same) for a degustation menu with food of lesser quality. My wife's dessert even came in the form of a birthday cake

We stumbled upon Fratini's on my birthday last year, although very busy we were given "the best 2 seats in the house" (at the end of the long work counter). There is no menu, so Gabriel creates and explains a wonderful 4 - 8 course (lunch or dinner - we've had both) array of dishes that are served "tapas" style. Although the food is fantastic Gabriel and Leng (his wife) make it much more than a great meal. No matter how busy it is, they take the time to chat and joke with their guests and add a real personal touch to make it memorable experience

I shouldn't be too positive in my praise because then everyone will want to go and it will make booking a table even more difficult. All I can say is that the whole experience was outstanding and some of the ingredient combinations were inspired. The chef and wife are indeed the stars of the show with their wonderfully welcoming style but take nothing away from the food which is exceptional. My only concern was there was just too much food, but when it is that good, why worry. He best restaurant experience in Singapore. We will be back for sur

We did not know there would be no menu when we first sat down at our table. The chef started by asking if there was anything we did not or could not eat. Once that was ascertained, the courses started coming one after another. No need to think at all; just sit back, eat and enjoy. Food was delicious and the service was wonderful. Highly recommended and reservations are a must

What a place...as outlined by the other reviews already, there is no menu.The chef comes over to the table after you set down and asks if there is anything you don't want to eat. We weren't limited in our choices so just said to go ahead.The food was truly amazing. And there was certainly a lot. The price is very reasonable.I won't go into the details of the dishes that were served as every dish that came out was a little bit of a surprise which just added to the experience.The chef served most of the food himself and was always friendly and up for a chat as was the rest of the staff.We decided that Gin Tonics would be the drink of the night and the chef decided to have one for every drink that we ordered.All in all, an amazing night in a great place with fantastic food and great service.Will definitely go back again

This is one of the most relaxing ways to enjoy a meal with a group. The staff and chef are warm and welcoming to the point that our dinner guests thought we must be regulars by the way we were treated even though the reality is this was our first time! Food was excellent! Atmosphere is intimate. I want to share this restaurant with everyone

We visited this restaurant at the invitation of one of our friends in Singapore last night. What a great discovery. As other reviewers have said there is no menu here and the food on offer is based on the freshest ingredients available each day. The owner Gabriel Fratini and his wife personally manage the whole process. If you are a regular diner at some restaurants the menu can become very repetitive, that will not happen here. The welcome is very warm and it was good to see returning diners greeted as if old friends. To commence the meal we were asked if there was anything that any of us didn't eat. One of our party of 3 doesn't eat meat but is very happy with fish, seafood and vegetarian. This presented no problem for them and the only meat dish we had arrived just for those of us are carnivores. A welcoming Prosecco to start the meal and an excellent bottle of Sicilian red wine,recommended by Signor Fratini, to accompany the food.Each course was really well presented and everyone of them tasted to perfection. I noticed that, in common with a certain famous chef who seems now to do most of his work on American TV, there are no condiments on the table. The philosophy is that the food is specially prepared and seasoned and there is absolutely no need to mess with the fine balances of the taste.There were, I think, 4/5 small dishes for us to enjoy and then a larger pasta dish served straight to the table and freshly prepared in a hot pan. A seafood accompaniment was also served. It was delicious.Desert came in 2 forms. Firstly there was a small chocolate tart that the owner asked us to taste and tell him what was in it. Apparently there are 3 different ingredients. I got the chocolate and the chilli but I didn't get the mango flavour. The tiramisu was served on a large spoon. One of our party is allergic to chocolate and a new one minus the chocolate powder was immediately offered.It was a wonderful evening with excellent food and wine and it was great not to have to take a decision on what to eat but to have that decision made for you. If you insist on browsing through extensive menus this might not be the place for you. My recommendation is that you do visit the restaurant, if you can get a table, as it's fame and popularity increase. Place your self in the tender care of Signor and Signora Fratini and you will have a fabulous evening and leave without that over full, stuffed, feeling you can get in some restaurants. For us, the portion size was exactly right.For us it was exactly right and we had a good night that we shall remember very favourably for a very long time. A big thank you to Signor and SignoraFratini

We finally managed to get a table last night at this excellent local restaurant. It's quite small and very popular, so it is nearly always fully booked. The owner kindly squeezed us in and we were not disappointed. You don't have any choice of food (this may not suit everyone) although the charismatic owner did check with us to see if there was anything we didn't eat. Once it's established that you have no allergies or aversions the food just keeps coming - delicious, small mouthful sized portions of all sorts of tasty and flavoursome Italian dishes, served tapas style on boards and plates. Eventually just when you are getting full, a truly scrumptious pasta dish arrives in the pan it was cooked in, sizzling hot and full of delicious flavours. Finally, when you really have no room left the puddings arrive - again a selection and again all bite sized. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the owner mingles with his diners and then pops into the kitchen to help the chefs. It's a great atmosphere and a thoroughly enjoyable way to eat excellent and different authentic Italian food.
