Been to these joint few times, personally I will choose them over Mac and BK.
Their food is pretty good, not super fantastic, however, it is a good option for a change of fast food.

Variety of burgers and side orders. their mushroom soup as a side order is a good concept. Cheese fries are with additional 20 cent. its a good deal.Burger Up's Relish burger- I am relished.. one of the delicious burgers I had recently. Definitely will visit again. Burgers are big and juicy. Fresh ingredients.. overall a nice fast food chain with DIY burger facility.Their service standard can be improved. if the delivery time exceeds the expectation of the customers, it will affect the business. Hope the management will look in to it. As a start up burger joint, people will always expect the delivery time and service standard by comparing with MC Donald's or BK. Overall, as of now, worth to visit and burgers are value for Money

I dont know but most of the fastfood the food normally taste not bad but is always the service that sucks .i think those that station as the Cashier should really at least has basic coutesy to greet the customer with a smile or say thank you but most dont even have the heart to make customers feel warm.Also worst everytime the customer ordered this indian lady will show black face and make customer feel hurry to pay and go and serve next customers so is that how they feel they care for many customers than making it regular one no wonder so lacking service .Even when my family member take away the meal home i was shocked to find some hair in the chicken ...and the nugget was wet .They didnt even the proper hygiene or attitude to keep the food clean.i was disapointed. Now customers already using the machine to order all they need is to prepare the food and with some "heart" ...what keeping them bus

Came here for Saturday night's chill out, here's what we think (Note we compared them to all other Burger joints that we have been to before):Ambience: 4.5/5Cleanliness: 5/5Customer Service: 4.5/5Quality of Food: 4.5/5Value for Money: 5/5Our Orders:Fish Fillet: 4/5Yuan Yang Burger: 5/5Fried Chicken Wings: 4/5Fried Mushroom: 4.5/5The Good: Singapore's very own burger joint, located in the heartlands where Singaporeans hang out, we like the overall feel, it's like a peaceful and serene version of McD, BK, and also quite high tech. We think the food is healthier, and for the price it fetches, it's very very worth it! The Bad: Overall we thought the portions, while comparable to McD, BK can be a bit bigger, but probably also because we really enjoyed the burgers! Maybe can consider introducing RamLee burger into the selection as well, cos it's a local flavoured burger too! Bottom Line: If you're Singaporean, must come! If you're a tourist, definitely must come if you are hungry for local burgers

Wonderful burgers. I have been going back to this place almost every other month. You have to try the Yuan Yang Burger (1 chicken + 1 beef patty) and the The burgers are massive and really really filling. You could eat it for lunch and might even skip dinner

First time trying this burger joint. The burgers well.. not bad but can be pricey compared to McDonald's and burger king. A meal with a supreme burger, drink and side costs around $11.80The sauce for the herbalicious burger is very nice. It is something familiar but could not put a name to it. overall it's okie. i'm satisfied with my mea

Had checked this new burger outlet in Waterpoint mall Pungol, n trust me its really one of d BEST burgers ever ate... Firstly its HALAL.Secondly, the order system is new n unique.Thirdly order response time is quick.Finally the food... Its yumm..burger patties are juicy n tasty, n their rice combos also not bad at all...So, tagging themselves as "made in Singapore", its a big from me, n mustt try fr all food lovers.
