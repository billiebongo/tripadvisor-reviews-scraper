Passionate and friendly staff make up the cramp small place. Would recommend anyone to try whenever you want Korean in Chinatown

Excellent service from the time you enter the Resturent and till the time you leave. Food was pretty pricy and is meant for sharing. BBQ items will be BBQ for you by the staff handsfree from the Chor of doing so. Only concentrate on eating.

A fusion style of Korean restaurant. Despite of the wide variety of good dishes, i am thrilled with the service renderred by the service crew. There is a crew named 晓莉姐 treated you like you are dining at home making the whole dining experience a delightful one.Highly recommended

The service was very friendly and they accomodated for my every wish, including my severe msg reaction. My one criticism is the manager going outside and consistantly saying a loud 'HELLO' to almost every passer by, this must irritate the punters already eating. She doesn't have to do this as it is a great restaurant. She scares more people away with her 'sales pitch' than getting people in the door. Learn the law of attraction, it really does work

Horrible food, terrible service if it were just that , I would probably not even care about writing down this review. This place is over priced and calling it just underwhelming would do injustice to the word "underwhelming". From down right bad portions to limp banchan, to smelly (I KID YOU NOT- SMELLY) rice this place is a hazard waiting to happen. I ordered Dolsat bibimbap(15$) ,Tteokbokki($20) and citreon tea after making my reservations at eatigo app. the food wasn't just subpar, I think it was left over crap mixed with other food. portions were tiny... for $20 there were 4 pieces of rice cake mushed together with a little bit of synthetic ramyoen. citreon tea that had a weird after taste. Dolsat Bibimbap was the absolute worse. It had a smell. unwashed rice smell. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all

We got to know this place from the app Eatigo. We got a 50% discount so thought no harm giving it a try. The service was quick and the service staff tried to get us to order a lot which is understandable as they may want to make up the difference from the discount. Unfortunately we won't be coming back to this place ever. The beef short ribs we ordered were of Super Low grade, sliced to Super thin and have no feel of a Korean BBQ at all. The ginseng chicken had Chinese herbs instead of ginseng. So not the Korean ginseng chicken one would expected. ordered the seafood pancake and all we see is yellow Color of the egg , spring onions and sliced chilli, hardly any sign of seafood. Worst, no flavor at all. While it was at 50 discount , its hardly worth the price at all and wasted our precious night out. It was clear the shop skimped to make the most profits. It's not ethical and downright cheats!

It's interesting to find a good Korean restaurant which happens to be located in Chinatown. Very good and authentic Korean food. I ordered the Beef Bibimbap which comes with banchan (small side dishes). The prices are decent. I wanted to return, but didn't have enough time during my visit to Singapore. I would definitely recommend to my friends

Visited here late one evening with my girlfriend trying to look for something more affordable than a lot of the nearby restaurants.We were approached by the staff of Gum Gang Won with their set meal offer, 9.80SD l, which including one main dish, 6 sides and rice! We opted for chicken/pork dishes and a side of fried dumplings and it was delicious.Both food and service was great, would highly recommend to anyone in the area

One hungry afternoon, I was looking for a place for late lunch. Being the first day of Chinese New Year, most of the shops in Chinatown were closed. But not this Korean resto in Temple Street; it was business as usual. Even the receptionists didn't seem to lose their passion in hawking their cuisine to passersby. So much energy. They truly work for their patrons.I had a simple meal, by starting off with cold Tiger beer and appetizers (kimchi and fresh broccoli flowers). My main meal was fried rice with beef, and i had a sunny side up placed on top of the rice for complement. I ate everything in less than 15 mins.Food was as expected. Friendly service is a big plus. Price was affordable. Will be back with my family.

Very busy street in Chinatown so we thought we'd eat Chinese. There was a spruiker outside and we went in to find a Korean restaurant with a whole lot of smiling waitresses. We ordered the lunch deal at $9.80. Soup arrived first. Then the meat course - one chicken and one beef. We though that would be it as they sizzled away on the plates. Then no less than six side dishes arrived, broccoli, kim chee, spinach plus plus. We though that would be it when a bowl of rice each arrived. Top that off with green tea and you have to get the best value in Singapore. But - finally - I have to say that was the tastiest meal I've had here!!!!Brilliant!And the staff were so friendly.

Have been here for their set lunch and decided to try their ala carte dinner. We came about 7 pm on friday and only two tables left as place is quite small. Ordered Seafood pancake , spicy korean soup, Saba fish. We were served with 7 types of appetizer and love them all. Best is kim chi and potato salad. Pancake is thin and crispy though not much seafood . Saba fish is big but just ok. Love the tofu soup which has egg and taste and spicy level suit us. The service staff offered toreplenish the appetizer when they run low. Small but cozy for meals. Will return to try their bbq which seems popular with diners.

We chanced in here early in our trip to Singapore, and were treated to a beautiful Korean dinner. It was so good that we returned some days later to try some different dishes. If anything, it was even better. The staff helped us to choose, and were taken by how warm and gentle they were. The food was full of flavour, and the portions very generous. They tried to give us a discount for being returners, but we refused it. The food was already terrific value! Would definitely recommend this place

Went there for an early dinner on a Saturday. The service was so good and personalised that will definitely make me go back again. Even before entering the shop, my friend and I were greeted by a very friendly lady at the door, welcoming us to the restaurant. The lady then started recommending us some of their signature dishes as all the food on the menu looked very tempting to us. Despite my friend being a vegetarian, the lady did not find it troublesome and took the extra mile to find out what kind of ingredients he is able to consume before confirming his orders. But what surprised me most was how attentive and detailed the lady was! As I had ordered “Bibimbap”, and was wearing white that day, the lady gave me a mini apron to wear it in front of my shirt, and asked the other waitress to mix the rice first before serving it to me. This was to ensure that the sizzling sauce will not stained my shirt. Furthermore, as our phones were placed on the table, she also gave us ziplock bags to put our phone in so as to not dirty our phones. That was so sweet of her!Apart from the service, the food and ambience was great too. For those who would like to have a taste of authentic Korean food, you may give it a try at this restaurant. Overall, I was pleased to experience such high level of service standards in a small restaurant. The lady serving us deserve a personal compliment for her warm hospitality

5 stars for 50% discount voucher and friendly staffDrop to4 stars for the food servings, stingy serving! Order bbq set A pork belly is very thin! Garlic slice very thin, sauce very little (1 tsp) but prawn is big. Small Kimchi jjigae only have glass noodle, tofu and kimchi, no meat (normal price $15??!) Drop to 3 stars for food standard. It doesn't give you an impression that will make u come back for the food, it only good enough to fill ur empty stomach. Drop to 2 stars for payment method. Cannot use credit card on the day i visit so please prepare enough cashDrop to1 star. Went home rushed to toilet.First and last visit even with 50% discount. Not worth it. If you do not have any discount voucher, stay away from this restauran

I was there today, food was really good. But what surprised me most, how nice was the lady serving me. She was so nice, if she is owner, than that's how every owner should be, conhrats. If she is just employee - she should get raised

We stumbled across this fantastic little Korean restaurant on our first holiday to Singapore. The owners are so lovely, and friendly and proud of their cuisine. The food was fresh, tasty & aromatic. This was by far the best food we ate during the 4 days we spent in Singapore. Absolutely value for money, We had a lunch menu choice chicken Bulgogi with green tea on both visits. The owners remembered us from our first visit and were so excited we came back. Definitely encourage everyone who visits China town to go there for a meal

I can't rave enough about the service I received here! The lady attending to us was extremely helpful despite the language barrier. Gave us a drink on the house, discount on our meal and even provided us with a free umbrella when it started to rain as we were leaving.While not the best Korean food I've had, it's not bad and the service more than makes up for the whatever the food lacks

I went there with my family and their prices were not worth it for the portions that you are going to get. Everything was small and when we asked for refills, the portions came back even smaller. LOLThis is definitely one of the restaurants I will never patronise ever again because of the exorbitant prices and minuscule portions.If you don't eat much, maybe you won't mind it, but for BIG eaters like myself, this doesn't cut it at all!Hope it helps

I have struggled so much on our travels that I was actually giving up hope! The staff were lovely, the recommended some of their favourites for me to try, we were given little side dishes to nibble on while we waited for our meal, the sweet potato was delicious! Our food was good, the service was great and the buzz of watching the craziness around us added to the atmosphere

we love the service and the fact that they understand that one of us is a vegetarian. exceptional food, great service. very friendly folks

Found this restaurant while walking through Chinatown. Made very welcome by the friendly staff. The food we had was excellent and all other diners seemed to be enjoying theirs very much. Will definitely return to sample other dishes.

We chanced upon this restaurant because we had a sudden craving for Korean food. We wanted to try a different restaurant at first but it was closed. We walked to Temple St and found this little gem.We ordered the BBQ set, kimchi soup and a pork bibimbap. The food was good! The service was even better. The lady was helping us throughout our meal with the grill. She even made sure that our pork was cooked all the way before we ate it.At one point, the young lady seated at the next table dropped food onto her t-shirt. The lady came over immediately with a cloth and some detergent to help her clean the t-shirt. She did her best and she was pretty genuine. We were quite surprised by her actions. We felt like we were at home. First class service in a tiny restaurant. Just for the service alone, we give it a 5* rating. When combined with the food, it was an experience.I read the reviews of this restaurant by other guests. If the reviews were true, then they have outdone themselves when they rectified the various issues

This was the WORST food experience I've ever had. The food was tasteless, bland and extremely overpriced. The side dishes were so lacking, especially the kimchi. You can get much better tasting food at a hawker centre in Singapore. If you are looking for authentic Korean food, please do not step in here because it's a rip-off. One waitress was friendly, while another had a sour face and slammed the dishes on our table when serving. Please please don't waste your money and time eating at this restaurant! I wouldn't even give this restaurant 1 star, but it is the minimum so I've got no choice

I have installed this app just to warn others about how horrible my experience at this restaurant was. The service was bad, the waitress actually made things worst while I was trying to enjoy the bad food. Over priced as the food is worst than food court quality. They even got my order wrong when I was the only customer in the restaurant at the time of ordering. Never ever going back there. They will have to pay me for me to even step in to that place.

we went to this restaurant at 22:30 and the lady who works there was really welcoming and friendly.I ate korean fried chicken and my friend ate fried dumplings they were really delicous.We paid 47SGD for two with 2 coke.Service was little bit slow and no wifi but they served us many different small dishes as a taste and while we wait.We really enjoyed and taste was amazing.If you went to tample street you shoud try that restauran

DON'T waste your money or time eating here. It has the worst tasting Korean dishes I have ever eaten. To call itself a Korean restaurant when it can't even do a proper kimchi, is really a joke. The food was way over priced, and tasted so bad. The service staff were unfriendly and impolite. Ordered fried rice, and the waitress asked if we'd like eggs in our rice. We said yes. Turns out it was an additional top-up of a sunny side up that looked like a plastic egg or really, the most horrible and processed looking egg I have ever eaten. For a restaurant that can't even do sunny side ups well, which is such a basic dish, I really wonder why they are still open. I don't usually give such harsh reviews, but this felt like a scam and and I really regret wasting my dinner and money here

I made my visit today to have my first try at this Chinatown located Korean restaurant and let me tell you that unless you wish to waste money on some non-authentic Korean food, this is the place. The kimchi have no taste, the army stew taste like instant noodle pot with the luncheon meat and sausages. To make matter worse, the restaurant is small and the waitress keep banging onto our table. Lastly it seems to be gathering point for all mainland China chinese and you have to raise your voice to talk to your friends etc. To all local diners, you can find better place than this

2 staff were standing around at the counter and we had to ask twice for us to get our small snacks to arrive. There were only 3 other tables at the time and the group that came after us received their snacks and drinks before we did. The wait for our food was very long as well.

....is not something they do in this restaurant, but it got you reading this, didn't it?Not being short of places to eat in Chinatown, a Korean meal may not be the first thing you think of as you wander the colourful streets, but this actually is worth a try.We've been back three times, so it must have something. For food I would give it a very good, for two people try a beef and a chicken bulgogi, which when eaten with the tasty array of vegetables is delicious. A bottle or two of the Tsing Tao beer with it goes down a treat. The service? Well, not at all bad but could try a bit harder, some of the vegetable dishes would benefit from a top up without you feeling guilty asking - particularly their tasty kimchi, which really makes the meal.Overall an enjoyable experience, and two bowls of kimchi will render you enough garlic to compete with the average Singaporean taxi driver on the way home
