This is an open air coffee shop with 7 food stalls selling noodles, pork rice, Thai food, pork chop, etc.
The place is very simple. A place to have a fast meal for a reasonable price.

the place is clean and tidy
However the stall was just merely 7-8 stalls which is too few to be labelled as food court. it is more resemble to basic coffee shop (kopitiam)

Choices are average, but at least it's clean and it's got everything to fulfil any palate. Most stalls open very late, so good for that late-night hunger.

We had a couple of lunches in the Food Court and were surprised at the cleanliness of the premises, they seemed to be ever cleaning. The food on both occasions was excellent and quite cheap too. We were well catered for.

Only visit for coffee and juices now. The stalls are getting worse and worse. Used to have nice kolo mee but they changed chef now and the noodles tasted so awful! Pity!

The proximity from my workplace is very near. So I always try to come and eat here. My favorite is the Thai shop. No matter what I eat there its delicious! The best so far is their tom yum fried rice ‚òù

This is just a block from the Zhongshan Mall and its Food Fair food court, but this one is stand alone, on the corner, and the prices are even more reasonable. Everyone can choose which kind of food they want, from the many vendors. Their shop space is minimal but the food is very good. The Fish and Chips I ordered at Grill and Pasta had three pieces of delectable moist fish, fries, and slaw. Garlic Toast was extra. Vern had 2 pork chops with mushroom sauce, potato salad, slaw and garlic toast. Drinks are ordered at a separate stall. The place is monitored and each shop has its identifiable silver so it gets back to the correct vendor. Sharing tables is ok, ask 1st. Grab your spot on arrival. The only way to eat in Singapore on a budget

The food is good enough, what i like the most is pork rice. But if you want to try others, the recommended one is thai food (at the corner), and besides the thai food (forget the name). I suggest to bring your own mineral water here as the price is expensive

Best Kolo Mee. Yummy and good price. The roast meat from the same stall is very nice too. The drinks stall offers freshly squeezed juice which is rare in a coffeeshop. And they open till past midnight. A bonus when you want late night supper or drinks.
