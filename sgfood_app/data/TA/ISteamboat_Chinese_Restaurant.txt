Reservations with Chope is easy. My family enjoyed iSteam Chinese buffet Restaurant because the food is nice and service is good.

A 4-tier steamboat - steam, a dipping sauce of ya choice, bbq & steamboat. V interesting concept. Love the well marinated fish! Not 4getting the ice cream!
4
A good trial for the porridge lunch buffet. It's not just porridge alone, there are soups, rice and noodles as well. Food is not really fancy but we are happy with the varieties. We loved the braised pork most, and the curry items too.
3
Had the porridge buffet during lunch time. It came to about $10 per pax. The varieties of the dishes have reduced compared to the previous visits I had. But it is still sufficient for a quick lunch buffet.
3
The food quality standard dropped a lot from the last time I visited months ago. The curry was watery and diluted. Fried fish was soggy and wet. All dishes seemed more salty than before. Only the ice cream selection was acceptable.
3
Not really fantastic. 3 tier take very long to cook as it's using the steam from the soup for 2nd and 3rd. Variety so so. Prawns not fresh.
3
Great for big groups!! Came here with 10 others and we had a great time. The soup base was great, seafood especially the bamboo clams were fresh! BUT the meat wasn’t so good and I didn’t exactly enjoy the marinate that got quite sickening after a while. Also the free 3 buns steaming on top of the steamboat pot was not nice. Hahaha.
3
Had the 4 tier pagoda steamboat buffet with salted egg dip on the top tier. Ordered the tom yum and herbal chicken soup base. The herbal chicken soup base was really tasty. Didnt fancy the salted egg dip though. Quite a wide selection of food but the fish we had wasn't fresh. Overall, is still an ok place to visit given the price is reasonable
3
Booked this buffet for a family of four under SingTel so given the price I paid, I would said it was really worth it. Picked two soups for the steamboat and the sauce (salty egg). The taste of the salty egg sauce was not really strong, diluted I guessed. However, one can mixed other sauces such as vinegar, garlic and chilli, to your own liking. Served two types of fruits but the choice of ice-cream was good (8 different flavours). As for the BBQ items, good spread but that tier seems a bit cramped so it was kind of difficult to do it right. All in all, enjoyed that night of dinner with my family
5
First time trying there and would say the food is fresh and nice affordable for the price of $22.80 on weekdays which i went. Pagoda style of grilling, steaming and soup base was terrific and nice, especially the imperial soup. Buffet spread was not like hotels but 40 over dishes is good enough for me and family. Food was fresh and nice variety. The ambience though was acceptable, just dont expect big hotels ambience
2
The food didn't taste great. Soup base was a disappointment too. I has Mala. Which tasted like chilli soup (now I'm a mala fan). Herbal was plain. $22 for dinner buffet that didn't include ice cream.
3
The food served is as simple as it can be and comparing to many other steamboat buffet places, they don't stand out as awesome. Having an individual steamboat looked cute but to wait for the soup to boil is frustraing.
3
Nothing to talk about the ambience. Service is mechanical, food from the ala carte buffet is short of quality. Price is cheap... can skip unless you are in your teens, limited budget and have a big appetite...
1
Ordered the fish soup and ma la. Fish soup tasted really bland as if it's water and seasalt while the ma la has a very distinct black pepper taste instead of the usual peppercorn taste.
4
Simple porridge with local dishes. Cha Kway Teow and carrot cake is nice.
Will be good if they can include the ice cream in their buffet as $1 for a scoop of ice cream is abit.
Good place for group and family gathering.

Visited on 29/04/2017 with my mother. I'm using fave voucher-$19.80 for 2 but have further discount for 10% so is just $17.64 for 2 n is with ice cream. It is located next to Koufu food court n Omma Spoon. Reached there 12:38pm already full,so been told have to wait for 30mins,i walked around while my mother sit outside waiting. Went back 12:50pm my mother told me,we missed the chance of going in n have to wait till 13:25 then can go in. So i waited outside,a lady approached us n suggested me n another family of 3 to sit together in a round table so we no need to wait for another 30mins. We agreed n we sit together.Food range is normal,braised peanut,omelette,cabbage,braised fried beancurd,tofu,fried rice,fried black carrot cake(saw many ppl take,so i tried but it had a strong burn taste),fried beehoon,fried fish(quite crispy),curry chicken,mini steam bun,soup,orange,watermelon,ice lemon tea. As for ice cream,it have 8 types of flavours-mango,vanilla,chocolate,cookies n cream,matcha,mint chocolate chips,etc...Found out that those that having porridge buffet is unable to have the ice cream. Then i realised that after i settled my redemption with the lady,she passed me 2 ice cream cup. So only those ppl have ice cream cup is allowed to take ice cream.Overall experience is average,service is fast while clearing empty plates
3
I get to know that the company was taken over by another company so I went to try whether the dish had improve? The staffs was friendly and efficient. The variety of food was much more and it replenish quite often. For the price of less than $11 is reasonable for the dish they serve but if they have serve better food like more meat that will be a plus credit. The drinks was mixture of syrup, it taste too much mixture of water. If they could provide soft drink would be better. Average price for an average tast

As new visitors to Singapore we thought we were taking the easy option by going to this restaurant rather than one of the hawker stalls where we were less sure of how it all worked / what to order. We misinterpreted the menu thinking that we were ordering a range of Oriental dishes like we would at home, e.g. we thought the "soup" they were talking about was a starter! Of the waiters then explained the concept and we came to realise that most of what you're choosing are items to go into the broth (we had one plain chicken and one tom yum: the latter is medium spice level for my English palate) and some of the other dishes are "normal" to have as side-dishes to the broth, e.g. chicken teriyaki. We thought the food was basic but pleasant. The only wine on offer was cheap and not-so-cheerful! But we enjoyed the experience as something different and I bet that Steamboat will soon be hitting the UK as a concept, if it hasn't already
3
The Tomyam soup base was good. Slightly disappointed with the choices of meat as they were quite limited. However, lots of choices for the yongtaufoo kind of food.Replenishment of the food was also slow and things ran out quickly. Other than that everything else is ok.
2
My friends and I spent close to 30mins trying to change the fire so that our pot could start boiling. We entered the rest at 9pm but was informed that the buffet had ended by a Philippine staff. However, we were told by another staff that we could have buffet if we want and the rest closes at 1030pm. As we are a group, we ordered a few sets. However, the food took a while to come. We managed to get the fire fixed eventually with the help of a good local aunty and the manager of steamboat.As it was already 1030pm and we were still eating, a female lady staff started coming to our tables and clearing our food. What made me really unhappy was that she did not ask before clearing. I was still drinking my soup and eating the durian ice cream at the same time but she took away my durian ice cream. I had to tell her that i want it before she returned back to me. She showed us a very black face throughout. Please do note that it was just barely 5 mins after 1030pm when all these happened. It would be nice if she could let us know that it's past their closing time and we would def be considerate enough to leave
3
Took a bit of time to find this restaurant as it's in a shopping mall and directions weren't very clear. Food was very good although a wee bit pricey, it's just because it's not a hawker centre. Staff were attentive.
3
The 3-1 concept is quite interesting with porridge, ala carte and steamboat buffet! worth trying for variety!
4
Fulfilling meal! Good!
The steamboat is quite a big plate for me and the sauce is nice.
I love the ice cream. Too bad no more rum and raisin for me.
5
It's super worth it. There are tang-o vegetables available for our selection. It's a premium vege that only house will buy for own consumption.
The beef is nice.
I love their 虾酱鸡。
Good job!
But the staff could have smiled more.. Hehe
4
Not bad. Food is good. Staff is friendly. The price is also decent. Overall quite a good experience there
4
I enjoyed dinning at iSteamboat as it is very value for money and the staff are very friendly. Variety is not fantastic but what is there to complain for such a great price.
4
The irony is that the steamboat was really average. Not sure if it is due to the wrong choice of soup base. Choose the TomYum soup base if you prefer spicy.
5
Good place, we come often. Reasonable priced, good selection. Come with family and friends. Food is fresh and hot.
3
It was interesting that this restaurant opted to provide an individual pot for each diner, so that they could have their own soup bases to cook their ingredients in. The ala carte menu featured both cooked and raw items, but the quality of food was way below standard. It was little wonder that they had to introduce so many promotions to attract more customers. There is nothing fantastic about this place, and I would rather pay more to be provided with a wider variety of food items of better quality or simply go to a coffee shop in future
1
Very bad experience but thanks to Trip Advsior. The map led us to a wrong place. Once we got there we decided to find the place through the address so we got there 40 minutes later around 9:30. In Trip advisor it says that it was open until 11 so we still had time. The problem is that the closing time was at 10 so when we were there the staff clearly was not interested in serving us. The buffet was finished by then and since nothing and nobody was being welcoming to us we decided to leave very frustrated about the whole experience
5
The ambience is good and relax. Food wise there's lots of variety cooked food. I would recommend this place. Price wise reasonable.
5
Went there late afternoon to have beer n light snacks and it was relaxing. Did my shopping and came back with my sister to have dinner steamboat ala carte. We enjoyed the food with a bottle of wine and ice cream in simple nice ambiance.
5
The porridge is well cooked and hot added t bigs pieces of sweet potatoes delicious.
There is lot of variety of dishes and dessert too.
5
We came in late, that was about 30mins before the end of the buffet. Luckily we are still managed to have our fill as the staff are still topping up the tray.
5
Second visit here, the food here never disappoint! Good place with good ambience and good food, will definitely recommend to friends!!
4
Been here the 2nd time, cheap food and taste good! Will definitely be back for more after school and will bring friends along too!
5
Very generous variety of food in this part of Singapore at Marina Square. This buffet also comes with free flow of drinks and ice-cream. Value for money. Highly recommended.
4
Been there twice for their porridge buffet on weekdays. Priced at $8.80, the food variety is quite a lot and is really worthy for that affordable price. Although most are simple dishes without any expensive ingredient, they all tasted good, fresh and most importantly, it has the flavour of home-cooked food and certainly appeals to people like me who miss mothers' cooking. Even the dessert, green bean soup, tastes heavenly and I definitely think is one of the best I ever had. Their ice cream tastes average though but is good enough for us to end the meal with something sweet
5
Value for money, only $8.80++ for all you can eat! Porridge, fried carrot cake, fried rice, noodles plus over 20 other dishes to go with your meal. A well balanced menu with tofu, veggies, braised meat, fish, chai poh eggs, green beans dessert , fruits and many others. Free flow of homemade barley drinks. Definitely will go back again :
2
Not the best quality of food. There is no ambiance at all, the space is simply done up and very dimly lit. It looks like a cheap setup.The porridge buffet is cheap and worth it however the steamboat was very poor. Not the best quality and poor equipment provided for heating.Service on the bright side was not bad. Cheerful guy served u
5
Nice food and good service, steamboat is good, the price is good , everything is perfect. Ice cream nice , variety of food provided
4
I'm a regular customer here and have been here many times. The food and ambience is great and it's a good value for money. Well recommended to all.
4
The food is good but it will be better if serve with ice cream. The place is clean as well.
Specially the mapo tofu, green bean soup, porridge.
4
Had dinner here on our first night here. Food was fantastic, service top notch and the price was very cheap!!! Been back with friends and they were suitably impressed!
1
Food is pretty bland and the service is extremely rude here. Owner is delusional and refuses to accept feedback. Went with a group of friends and they summed up the meal in one sentence: "wasted calories". Would avoid at all cost!
5
This is one of my favourite dining places. The title speaks for itself! The service is excellent! The staffs are friendly. Food is fresh.
5
Great place for families with children of any ages. Affordable price for porridge buffet and steamboat buffet!
An ideal place for tourist who wants to experience the Asian teochew style porridge buffet!
5
This is the most economical buffet porriage in the island. Moderate food and simple set up. The food is not too salty, and perfect when added in to the porridge. The service her is good, the service man here even take an additional effort to help we consumer to scope our ice cream. This is definitely worth buying and I would recommend people to come and try this out
5
My mom was the Chinese restaurant Manager of 01 resort in Vietnam so I did try Chinese food many time. But I have to say that the food here was amazing. I love the taste, the services...even the rate is quite high. I will come back in my next trip 
5
Awesome meal and very affordable, 2 men 3 dishes and two beers $44. Customer service was excellent and the gung bao chicken (not sure on spelling) was delicious!! Im not a spicy person but it's cooked with whole chillis, I picked them out and made a beautiful meal!!
5
Went there for dinner with my close friends. Their widespread buffet was really worth the price we paid for. It is also at a very reasonable rate as compared to other buffet steamboat i went to. Really good range. Enjoyed it alot!
3
Great food and affordable prices. Wide selection and it is more than porridge, there are carrot cakes, bee hoon, dessert and even curry. Will come back again.
5
Great steamboat buffet. Value for money. Lots of variety
A always come back venue. Great to have friendly gathering
4
Don't miss the porridge lunch buffet which is only 8.8 dollars ++. Good variety of food, soft drinks included, a good place to go to address your hangover....
5
If you love steamboat and Chinese food, this place is definitely worth a try. Good food, nice surroundings and cheap prices for foodies who want to come on a reguarly basis. Also good restaurant to bring the whole family
5
The restaurant is much cleaner than the previous time and the furniture was replaced to be neater and cleaner. There were free flow of drinks that included ice lemon tea and barley water :)
4
Cosy ambience, friendly staff! Wide variety at affordable price. Furthermore, their portion are huge and delicious. Spent nearly 3 hours enjoying the food here.
5

Awesome! Great Variety with generous servings! Best thing is it comes at an affordable pricing! Would definitely come again

We had the porridge buffet at iSteamboat. Pleasant restaurant settings. Great variety of dishes that are freshly prepared and replenished at the buffet counter throughout the course. Enjoyed the porridge classics like braised mince meat and curry chicken. A hearty yummy meal with tasty dishes. Fantastic value for money! Will definitely return!
5
Went there after work with friends.the food was value for money and great ambience. The quality of the service was excellent
5
Very tasty food at attractive prices.
If you have not visited you better make it soon.
Am having dinner with Freddie Foo and he is thrilled.

Nice atmosphere, plesant staff. Will visit again! The selection is simple but clean. Price is economical. Very hard to beat value and dining environment. Great for familes too.
5
It is a great place to be here and the food here have many choices to choose from. It worth the money and the staff is very helpful. And they have service us well and the place is well located.
5
We have been visiting iSteamboat for many years and we simply love the variety of food .
But most of all , we have made friends with most of the staff members and they are a wonderful lot of people !
5
I was there with my family for a dinner and I totally enjoyed the dinning experience. The food are value for money. The ambience was nice and cosy. Thumbs up.
5
As the title suggests , nowhere else will you find the numerous variety of teochew porridge ' goodies 'as in here at iSteamboat.The waiters and waitresses are very warm and friendly and that's why we have been coming here for years .And we will continue to do so 
5
Hubby and I have been coming here since it opened 8years ago! We still love the warmth of the staff and the Boss himself. Boss looks like he treats his staff well as we noticed that there are staff who have been working here for a long long time. Once I even suggested that it would be good to include a particular item in the menu and Walah! it was included at my next visit.Although we cannot eat as much as before, the variety of food is still value-for-money. Other than the value-for-money food, we appreciate the great service of the staff
4
I am a born and brought up typical Teochew used to live in Ponggol now called SENGKANG. We used to have our dinner or supper at this "Ah Seng Porridge" in the 5th Miles market beside this LIM TUA TOW ROAD off Upper Serangoon Road. Having my lunch here reminds me of the spread I used to eat at "Ah Seng Porridge".Now all my friends and business partners I brought here for lunches, they are bringing their families during weekends.CheersChu
5
Have been visiting this place for many years now. Great value for money, and the food's good! I like the fact that drinks come together with the meal, and now- they allow you to scoop as much barley or Chin Chow into your own drink!
5
I have been here for many time with my family. We enjoy eating here. Staff here are very friendly and helpful. Keep up with the good service.
5
Being here for the past 8 years and till now still my favorite hangout. The food is good and fresh, staff is friendly here.
5
The food here is nice and delicious and cheap. Therefore, I come to eat at least 3 times a month.😍😍😎
4
Value for money, great place to eat with friends and family.
Lots of variety and frequent top ups for the porridge buffet. There are more than 20++ dishes offered.
4
Food is nice with spacious seatings. Place is clean. Value for money porridge buffet lunch with plenty of food choices. Free flow of drinks too.
5
There is a wide variety of selections and food is decent as well. I like how there is also man tou here which is uncommon in most buffets in Singapore. Price is reasonable as well at $8.80++ in the afternoon. Location is also very accessible at the central of Singapore. Drinks are quite healthy and nice too( home brewed I think). Fruits and snacks like popcorn are available too for casual aftermeal chatting. There is also a wide variety of sauces to choose from which I enjoyed.
5
AMAZING food fast service friendly staff what more can one ask for.

4
Food is good and so is the ambience! Came for the lunch buffet which starts at 11.30am to 4pm. Easy to locate as it is at the heart of the town. Price is reasonable and the service is great. Free flow of drinks to choose from. Wide spread of variety of sides to choose from. Came at 1.15pm and the food were almost wiped out. Had to ask the staff for a refill and they were glad to do so. Friendly and kind staff. Will definitely recommend people to come here to dine at. Great for value especially if you're looking for a good meal but on a tight budget. Will be back again
5
Such a nice place, worth the money. I have been here so many times. Every time I feel so enjoyable here. Very nice food, helpful staff and comfortable environment. I recommend here to my frinends. They all like here also.

5
I steamboat is a good place to eat, whether its for lunch or dinner. Price is reasonable and air con is strong. Food items is alot of variety. The lightings and the ambience for this restaurant is cosy and nice, not glaring, which me , my uncle and my hubby like it alot. We always come here for either lunch or dinner. Location of the restaurant is a good choice. I especially liked the free flow of ice lemon tea, grass jelly drink and barley drink. Not sweet and nice. My uncle say their cooked food like e.g. spring rolls, sweet sour fish, grill pork meat and stir fried vegetables are all very tasty , the cook is very detailed, we requested the cook to cook less salty , they also noted our request. Waiter and waitresses are all very attentive and sincere. Best restaurant i ever went. Thumps up.
5
iSteamboat is the place for steamboat for several reasons. Firstly, it has good value for the diversity of food items (eg. meat, seafood, vegetables) and soup bases. Secondly, if you have a friend that doesn't like to have a common soup steamboat or have a particular dietary preference, then isteamboat is the place to go as it has individual steamboat for each customer and at an affordable price. The setting is cosy and the staff are friendly. Strongly recommended
5
Very good worth the moneyThe foods should have more topping.i will be coming back again. The food is fresh and you can order more. Steamboat is one person one steamboat don't have to share. The staffs are also friendly and will keep refill your soup. Come with free drinks lemon tea grass jelly and ice water but ice cream have to top $1. Will come back for m
5
Went for a porridge buffet on a Saturday afternoon. It is a cosy place and we are sitting beside the glass window overlooking ground floor, nice view while eating. There's adequate walking space within table. 24 dishes are served alongside with porridge. Value for money, relaxing
5
My family enjoyed the vast selection of the buffet spread & also chose our own individual soup stock base. If you have room for dessert go for the nice selection of ice cream...Excellent friendly & attentive staff...Would highly recommend this restaurant for an unhurried & casual dining..
5
Came here for dinner and the mini steamboat was awesome! Fresh ingredients and hearty portions at a great price :) the service was really good too, especially our server Winson who was attentive and helpful throughout. A great place to dine without breaking the bank!
4
Enjoy the dinner here with my family.
Friendly staffs and nice ambience .
Would recommend ppl here to dine , especially enjoying the steamboats .
4
Went last Friday with my family 😄 love the happy vibe there~ They have wide variety of buffet and a la carte :) my parents and I love the Tom yum soup 👍🏻 Their prices are very reasonable too! Definitely worth it :)
5
Chanced upon this place with a group of friends and we were pleasantly surprised by the great price and good quality of the steamboat ! We left feeling well satisfied and would certainly return again.
4
Good food values for moneys. Having a la carte buffet with 60 steamboat items, 50 cooked dishes, free flow of ice cream, drinks and chocolate dip.
5
I have been coming to this restaurant for steamboat since 2012. Recently they have changed their concept towards more healthy choice. I observed they have offer more vegetables and cooking is less oilly.Now I even try to dine there with my family as I know we can eat in a healthier selection
4
Had dinner with my family at this restaurant last weekend. I love their steamboat, as they served the steamboat in individual pots and have a good selection of steamboat items. What's more fantastic is they also offer zhu chao options, at a low add on price. I will definitely be back with my family or friends.
5
The daily lunch teochew style sweet potatoes porridge buffet is filled with Good and comfort food and loving it :D - plenty of side dishes and come with free flow of drinks like homemade barley, ice-lemon tea, etc.Steamboat ala carte is a must try item too.Good place to dine with friends and family
4
We came on a Monday. Ordered the Steamboat buffet which was 18.80 each and comes with free drinks included. Aside from the food displayed at the buffet, there were more items that could be ordered from the menu which was also included.They serve a decent variety of soups and a fairly large selection of items.Thumbs up
5
I had lunch with friends and we all agreed ISteamboat offered the best value for a lunch porridge buffet! Good selection of side dishes like stewed pork, Chinese sausage, spicy minced pork, variety of stir fried vegetables, egg omelette and much more! Definitely, we'll be going back soon
