Great atmosphere here, along with a good food and drinks on an innovative menu. Really nice place for a evening meal

Love their appetizers and salad selection. Wished the grilled sea bass was still available but it wasnt as they change their menu regularly. Other favs include the grilled prawns.
5
Consistently delicious and great service. The cauliflower is great, the music is great, is an all round winner
5
Finding it was tough yet worth it! Cool funky, intimate setting, Amazing food and the owner is a real character!

staff are very attentive and friendly.. place is slightly smaller but cosy as they renovated the place..

Artichoke never disappoints. We have been here at least 4 times and we always leave feeling satisfied.This time we had the crispy kingfish collar and it was yummy-licious! We also had the kale salad, Turkish bread and a couple of other dishes. All was great!What draws us back again and again is the chill out environment. When the weather is cool, it’s really nice sitting outside enjoying the evening. Indeed, if you still have room left after the meal, a proper lollipop is in the order!
5
A place to eat with friends, if possible order many dishes to share. Must make reservation, and its a lunch / brunch place. I love the atmosphere, the service and attitude of the people working there, as well as the yummy food and drinks. It really has it all. Its that comfort food in a way, yet its discovery of tastes and presentation. Its art on the place. Its your place after a big party. Its your place to chill with friends, Its your place to get a nice brunch with mimosas. I've been twice, and a place to return to. Also got the cooking book last time, just to remind me of the place! Keep it up

Invited by a friend for dinner here, my husband and I were delighted at finding this gem of a restaurant! Given that we love middle eastern food and that we are vegetarian, this place was very well chosen for us. Situated in an "off the beaten track" garden several meters off of the street, the outside seating is made up of picnic tables, providing a casual and relaxed feeling. Service was attentive and pleasant, always on the ready to refresh drinks or take more menu orders. And then there was the food. Oh my! We ordered a variety of dishes, and every one was perfection. Special mention go to the muhammara and hummus dipping sauces, and our hands-down favorite, the tabbouleh. All were excellent but don't give the tabbouleh a miss.The only potential "downer" was that we found the portion size of the dips a bit small... not really enough for four people. So, we had to order more.Drinks menu was nice, too, although the quantity of cocktail you get for the price is a little lacking. A nice wine menu made up for it, though.We would go back again, for sure. An excellent choice

Artichoke is definitely an unusual and unique restaurant in Singapore worth visiting.First, it is situated at an interesting part of Singapore: junction of Middle Road and Waterloo Street or heart of, not just one, but three arts schools! It is tucked behind at a courtyard of a former small church and now Objectifs Gallery. If I recall correctly, they don’t even have a signboard such that you may not even know there’s a restaurant there!The venue is very rustic with both indoor and courtyard seating; under trees if you wish. They say they are a funky Middle Eastern restaurant. I don’t recall funky music and surely, they don’t smell funky. In fact, the food smells and tastes very good. Their food plating’s rustic in keeping with their surroundings and hence fashionably funky I deduce.My colleague and I had the smoked salmon dip and caramelized cauliflower to start. Then continued to share mains of fried brussels sprouts (I love it when they do interesting things to vegetables besides raw salads) and grilled chicken skewers. The other meat dishes sound really yummy especially if there’s a larger group to share with. Speaking of which, what caught my eye in the menu was the Lambgasm: a whole lamb shoulder for five to share, 48 hours’ notice needed and costs $220. So next time you are looking for a feast for a large family or office outing … but remember to order the Lambgasm in advance. The service was very friendly and attentive. I do wonder if some of them could be arts school students to add to the funky if not creative atmosphere. What was also eclectic was the waitress serving us was from Taiwan: a Taiwanese working in Singapore serving Middle Eastern food! I must add that the only disappointment I had with Artichoke was the absence of artichokes in their menu
5
Among many restaurant in Singapore. i found this place is so special. I heard a lot of this restaurant from friends but just have a chance to try. Restaurant offer really good food and service. It is a perfect place for brunch. Recommendation for those who want to go on weekend, reservation is needed. Luckily i went there with another friend so still have a good spot for trying an excellent food
5
Every time I visit the team are very welcoming and they are incredibly accommodating to nutritional requirements. Love the space and the food.
4
We ordered roasted lamb shoulder and cod roe dips which were very flavourful. The place has quite a bit of mozzies around, so do take note.
5
Always a good time with great food at Artichoke.
The flavors are not the usual ones, so it's quite a distinctive experience.
5
Great food, good service. Even though it was a bit noisy, it was worth the visit. But there was a bit of a hassle trying to find the place which was tucked away in a cosy corner
4
Hot skillet prawns-- blown away.. that sauce. Make sure you get Pita to dip. Wait staff was friendly and nice
5
Came with family for a birthday celebration and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend the squid, lamb and chicken dishes!
5
The food was really yummy! The brussel sprouts tabbouleh is a MUST ORDER. The beef short ribs was done superbly. My partner didn't agree with the pumpkin chips but I didn't have a problem with it. The mezzes were ok but the flatbread could've been fluffier. Ambience was great too. A pretty place to sit--inside or outside.
4
Artichoke cafe is tucked away nicely on waterloo street. Items on the menu were generally mediterranean themed. i selected the ful medames (spiced bean stew with other yummy stuff added in!), Despite it sounding all plain, it was delightful. The dish was full flavour and the accompanying baguette was crisp yet soft. I truly enjoyed the dish! My friends who ordered the lamb dish seemed to really enjoy themselves too!Overall, it was a good place to have our sunday brunch, there was a good vibe to the cafe and as lunch was approaching the cafe started raking in more guest!We left and was greeted by the service staff to grab a complimentary bag of candies from croatia! Pretty great experience
4
Food is of high quality albeit on the slightly pricier side. Only problem is that if you have a big party with a ravenous appetite the food choices are rather limited; we had to adjourn to another location after our meal at Artichoke because we have already exhausted the menu there. Regardless, my second time dining here and Artichoke can be trusted to serve a consistently good meal. Atmosphere is also warm and welcoming, probably more suitable for bigger groups of friends as opposed to a date / family dinner.Minor point - service staff gave the bill to the male even though it was a female that handed the card over. Name on the card was also gender neutral. Could potentially avoid such assumptions
4
The food here is tasty and delicious with decently sized portions. Came here with my family for dinner and we had a great time. The atmosphere was lively but not overwhelmingly loud so we could have normal conversations without having to shout. Good selection of cider too! I particularly enjoyed the warmed pita bread with the muhammara, so so so good. No wonder they're always booked out so quickly. Absolutely recommend
5
Everything was just perfect. Shared portions were yummy, good selection of beers and wines, lovely hipstery venue and just awesome old school music
4
nice food with nice coffee, prices slightly on the steep side . nice place for a weekend brunch gathering with friends and family
5
I visit this place almost every month. The food has never disappointed.
Service is never bad.
It’s a great place to spend a lazy weekend afternoon.
4
Everything was wonderful: food, service, feel of the place. BUT - the noise!! Shouting is contagious.
5
Started off with the hummus and babaganoush, accompanied by the softest and fluffiest pita bread, which were excellent. Then came the lamb shoulder that felt off the bone and melted in the mouth! Lovely meal.
5
The fried chicken and cauliflower were out of this world. It’s so yummy! Coffee was ok, but food impeccable.
4
I tried this restaurant for brunch and for dinner.
The food is very good. The quantity for brunch is good, but it could be better for dinner.
It was a bit noisy inside when I had dinner with friends.

I want to inform that Mark, the manager of Artichoke should be working as something else, but definitely, if this restaurant was mine, I would never want someone like this. This person was un polite, rude and had very bad manners with four ladies. The policy of this restaurant is that you can only split the bill in two. We were four so two paid and the other two gave cash to their friends. This policy is quite inconvenient and never seen before in other restaurant in singapore. So in order to pay, we asked for change in cash and the refused in very bad manners, to give to us. It was the waitress. So we asked to talk to the manager, since we had no way to pay the bills if they didn't give us some change. All this trouble just because of this non sense payment policy. Mark came to us and from minute one he was very agresive talking, rude and super un polite. Definitly a shame in a great food restaurant, where we will not come back just because they way this persosn, MARK, treated us
5
Different than your usual restaurants in Singapore. It is a refreshing break from the typical brunch food you get from the typical brunch places prevailing in Singapore now. Try the artichoke fried chicken, lamb shakshouka, crab and bacon toast, crab falafel, etc. Best to bring friends along so you can share different items. Warning: their servings are huge.
5
I am a big fan of Artichoke. As a regular customer, I have only good things to say about the place. Food is outstanding. The kitchen delivers the best Middle Eastern food (with a twist) in Singapore. I take outstanding quality any time over half baked attempts at more authentic hummus. I get outstanding service from the senior guys. They all recognise me. The regular staff can be a bit slow, but they try
4
wow wow wow! food was special and service was good. but it will be better if they serve their brunch menu for dinner too
5
I've patronized Artichoke a few times already and this time, i booked a reservation dinner for my company. And all of them sung praises of the food and music.
Their prawns and lamb was perfect.
Thank you for the hospitality.
5
A must for anyone visiting Singapore! Enjoyed A wonderful evening with friends while I was in town on business. Great service, food and wine selection... amazing owner too!! Will be back!
4
I went there many times. Always the same quality. The manager is very nice and warm. I will come back !
4
Consistently good (food and service) and vegetarian friendly. Portions are good for sharing. Brussels sprouts tabbouleh is a must try.
5
Loved the vibe!
Food was amazing.
The large bites was smaller than the small dishes though! Enjoyed the night there and will be coming back!
4
Had dinner here with the family. made a reservation via Chope and we were seated promptly upon arrival. We were seated at a table indoors but at the 'extension area'. airconditioned but quite noisy. Food was great! we had the hummus and babaganoush dip, chicken skewers (a bit on the fatty and oily side), lamb shoulder and hot skillet prawns. would def order all the above again (maybe not the chicken skewers tho).great dinner and service 
3
I had been to Artichoke once before and was more impressed, but this time the food was just average. The portions were very small for the price, and I've had much better hummus, baba ganoush, and roasted cauliflower. The lamb and octopus were good, but the appetizers were less than average
5
Great modern middle eastern food with quality ingredients. Chef changes the menu regularly, one never gets bored of the menu, although I do miss some of their older dishes. But generally the classic ones stay and we always look forward to having them again and again. One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore
5
Food is amazing. The lamb is always a good choice. Great for sharing. It's probably my sixth time dining at artichoke and I've had tables indoors and outdoors. This time round i went for lunch and was seated indoors on the high table. Either the aircon doesn't work well or that day was Super hot. It was incredibly warm indoors. That aside, the food is TOP-notch
3
The food was great and served up really quickly. However, follow up service was slow as the crowd built up. The place sets up a nice chill mood and offers good value wine.
3
I had been excited about my first visit to Artichoke having heard rave reviews. Unfortunately it didnt quite live up to the hype. The service was the biggest let down, the food was ok but not great.
5
Great food. The menu changes often and doesn't fail to deliver a few surprises. Try the squid. The restaurant itself is urban and casual with a nice terrace outside for enjoying a bite to eat over a drink or two.
5
We always come back here for a good lunch and a good time, great place regardless if it's just 2 people or a whole group. Staff were extremely friendly.
4
Was a unique dining experience. Very authentic Moroccan dish. Waiting staff were mostly pleasant. Quaint restaurant.
4
Middle Eastern fare served in a relaxed laid back setting. The food is delicious and service attentive. Provides a welcome break from the usual glass fronted restaurants of Singapore.
5
One of my favorite place in Singapore! The lamb is amazing! Hummus is delicious and the kale salad a surprisingly discover!
5
Good ambience good food had a good time with my friends at the cafe catching up. waiters were attentive and food was unique and good
5
Went early in Oct 2017 at 7pm weekday for dinner. Read reviews of bad service so was ready for rudeness. However it was excellent service all around. Food was prompt, plate clearing was done regularly. And our group of three stayed all the way till closing. No one chased us or hurried us away. Food was good and my two faves were the lamb shoulder and brasila something.
5
FOOD HERE IS TOP NOTCH. Not a single dish disappointed. We love this place and will come back repeatedly for its food The ambience is pretty good too. Came in a group of four, could talk easily. This is one of our favourite places to dine at for good reason. $30 per person after GST
5
Awesome little gem hidden away. Succulent and delectable meal. Tasty and served with a smile. A must when visiting Singapore ❤️👍🏻
1
The food or lack of food (most dishes run out by 9pm on a weekend night) doesn't make up for the rudeness of Artichoke's owner/ manager. Tons of places ain't Telok Ayer that offer more authentic versions of Artichoke's menu.
Visit at your own risk.
1
Staff are rude and not helpful. After hearing so much about this place will not returning again after this experience.
4
Food is delicious and very gourmet presentation. The standard seems consistently good, as my last visit was a year ago. Service staff also friendly. Enjoyable experience for mother-daughter lunch date. I also noticed there's big tables inside, for 8 to 16 pax. Will be back again sooner next time. Reservations highly recommended as lunch time very packed
3
Only because my gf's dish was OK it deserves some stars. My dish was too spicy, obvs it's a matter of taste, but they may have pointed it out prior. Black coffee wasn't tasty either, did not finish both. No questions were asked by staff, only if we wanted to eat more, dessert, no thank you
5
We found Artichoke down a small laneway late one evening and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Interesting posters adorn the walls and the whole place has a casual, bohemian feel. Service was excellent and we followed the advice provided by having Baba Ganoush, Cauliflower mezze followed by chicken seowk and a salad washed down with some Spanish sparkling and a NZ pale ale. Total cost S$105. The music, a mixture of rap, reggae, funk and other stuff was played at the right volume and as good as the food. Highly recommended
3
went for dinner there during the week. good point: the food is rustic and delicious bad point: food came at different times. so i sat there feeling so hungry while he was eating away. mine came 20 mins later!good point: old school Funk music Bad point: expat crowd being all pretentious  nice touch at the end of the meal, we were given a bag of sweets. i appreciated that gesture
5
I had been wanting to try Artichoke for a while and when I finally made it there, it did not disappoint. We shared a bunch of the mezze dishes. I loved the bean thatziki, muhammara and labneh dip. My favorite was the charred cauliflower which I didn't expect to like as I'm not a fan of cauliflower , but it was amazing. We also shared the lamb shoulder and bbq fish as mains. This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. I will be back
4
Touted to be a place of 'funky food, loud music, good times'... nothing funky about the food but fabulous and brilliant. We had the sangria, mezze plates of octopus with hummus, haloumi, charred cauliflower, and a main of prawns in green curry. Charred cauliflower was incredibly flavourful and I was very surprised by how good it was. Not big on the prawns as I had to remove the shell, whilst trying not to get sauce all over me. Not a good look on a first date which thankfully, this wasn't haha! Dessert of date and salted caramel soft serve was undeniably, the crowning glory. Thanks to staff for a complimentary bubbles for my birthday, and we loved the 'party gifts' upon leaving-lollies!
5
Came for dinner a month a ago and couldnt resist the sample platter deal. Couldnt finish it so the left overs came home for lunch. It was fantastic meal in SingaporeWent back for lunch yesterday. Ordered off the menu and over ordered but we wanted try more dishes. Fresh lemonade was great the dishes of choice were the first dish which was the beans, the chicken and the lambWhipped garlic from the chicken is a hit with all of us!Of course we will back. In my top 10 places ill go back to
4
Very nice atmosphere to hang out with friends. Food is delicious, service lovely, price reasonable. If you are looking for good Mediterranean food in Singapore it is the place!
4
Quick service and good food. My boyfriend and I were particularly impressed with the Smoked Salmon Dip and the Sangria. The duck dish had good flavor and was very tender too. Overall a very nice experience at Artichoke.
5
Very pleasantly surprised as I was not expecting such varied and good food. Service was quick and very friendly owner. I will come back.
5
I had heard a lot about Artichoke but had never been. I will be sure to make this a regular place to eat. Great for vegetarians as well as meat / fish eaters
5
As one reviewer put it, you will not be disappointed by anything on this menu. I really was impressed with the Mezzes and main courses. The fried Brussels sprouts are Worth going for alone and I do not like Brussels sprouts.The menu is small and regularly changed, with new flavours and combinations being added.Sit in the courtyard for maximum atmosphere and enjoy this little gem.
5
If you ar looking for a bit of everything you will not be disappointed with Artichoke It's slightly hidden but that gives it , its charm in the city.In between Orchard and City hall, its easy to visit, by MRT and bus or just walk.Choice of indoors and outdoors it has a great mix of red and white meat, the lamb is amazing.Don't forget the tapas styled Eggplant, I'd say all the dishes are excellent .I tend to over eat, so if you are in for a FULL meal, waste your calories a this place! I love it and i keep going back because Im boring when I find a gem
4
Had cravings for haloumi this morning and it seems like this is the only place that serves brunch with haloumi (I couldn't find it on other blogs or review). Everything on the plate goes really well together and I would highly recommend this dish. The price is on the high side $24. In Singapore, it's hard to find good food with decent price.
4
The service was friendly despite being a bit slow for our drinks. The Mediterranean were good even though I had better one near Haji Lane. The location and the atmosphere were great but the main reason why I recommend this place is the Lamb shoulder which was perfect. Just try it if you happen to go there!Most of the dishes are to share, perfect for 3-4 for people
4
I love this place, tucked behind the little yellow church on Middle Road. The outdoor seating has nice ambiance, the menu is good too. The hummus and babaganoush are standouts, as is the halloumi. I'll have to say I was a bit disappointed in the octopus - it was chewier than I remember. Overall a great place to eat with decent service - and a nice little bonus dessert when you leave
4
This is our second time at this restaurant - we were brought by a friend. Both times we had the lamb it and it didn't disappoint! I love that it is a little hidden away and a little quirky. The place was packed from the time it opened and had a queue lining up 15 minutes before opening. We were glad to have a reservation! We have sat both outside and in and inside can be a noisy - especially with big groups around. We sat outside yesterday and while quieter it was more difficult to the wait staff attention. While we ordered out food and the first round of drinks easily enough and the food came out quickly it was difficult to get a refill of drinks or further drink orders without one of us getting up and talking to a staff member at the door - hence the rating of a four. The food is excellent but the staff could be more attentive
4
A nice cozy restaurant tucked away in Middle Road... lovely place to have a quiet meal with your loved ones or even family members....
5
Inventive food, tasty food, great ambience/vibe and great for large groups or a romantic date. They also have some great wines that are not on the menu, so, don't be shy to ask what other wines they have in the cellar.
5
A friend brought me here. It was excellent.... The food was very fresh and tasty. The atmosphere was fun and lively. The staff were excellent and know there wine selections. Great hidden away spot 😀
4
The food here is always great, and any place that can get me enjoying Brussel Sprouts must be doing something right. The boss (owner?) is always very welcoming and sets the tone for decent service. The only real downside is that the acoustics are terrible so if you're in a big group it's impossible to hear each other. By dining outside you eliminate this issue, and can relax whilst enjoying the excellent food. The lamb is an absolute must.

Me and my friend had planned to have brunch at Artichoke. I arrived early and asked one of the staff regarding seating, his reply felt like a brick on my head (one of the rudest, with stern expressions). He said "We have no seats". I asked him if there was a way to get seats "He said perhaps we can sit at the bar". I said I will check with my friend as she was still on her way. In the meanwhile, I saw a table get empty. I asked the guy whether we could have it. He replied "It is reserved". So, I sought clarification from him whether they only provided seating with reservations (if that was the case then he should have told me this in the first place & I wouldn't have wasted time waiting there). He said again we can try seating at the bar. My friend arrived and this time there was another staff around so I asked him if we could sit at the bar. He was equally rude, hostile, and seemed yelling at us. He told us "we had to wait" and asked me to go behind and wait another group. I told him I had arrived before that group so I should not be going after them to wait. I told him that his colleague had told us that we can get seating at the bar. He replied in an angry & loud voice that he will have to check. By that time we were so mad at the hostility and lack of them suggesting any solutions that me and my friend decided to leave. I will not go back to this place. There is a way to speak. We can understand if a place takes only reservations or that there is no seating but here they did not communicate clearly what the case was and upon that the staff was literally yelling at us. By the way, after us was a family of 5 people who clearly had no reservation as they were waiting too, then how is it that had any hopes of getting a seat and not a party of 2. Totally turned off by the hostility. There are plenty of nice cafes in Singapore, wouldn't want to go to a place with snobbish and hostile staff
4
Great tasting mezze dishes. Good presentation and delicious. However way overpriced for what it is. Vegetarians only have options of starters from the mezze dishes and no main course. We were 5 guests on the 1st Of Feb 2017, only had mezze starters and no alcohol, total bill was $240.00 !! Service was rather messy as we had a possibly new staff waiting on us. She was corrected a few times by her supervisor. Music was way too loud to be enjoyed when on a night out with friends around a table.Ambience could be better as it sits in an old building next to the church. Lots of room for improvement but i repeat the mezze was good
4
This is a casual restaurant with a well defined identity. Good selection of wine and beers, delicious food and nice music. The lamb is just mouthwatering, best I've tried in Singapore by far. Not many menu options but all we tried was damn good. It's better quality than quantity, right?Shoutout to the manager Ronny and the whole team. You certainly have a jewel on that hidden spot by Middle Road. I will come back to you
5
As someone who has come here from opening day, the best part about artichoke is the incredible staff. Super chill, knowledgeable and genuinely care about their guests.The food is super comfort and always packed with flavour. No matter if you have brunch or dinner everything is approachable and has something that's a great twist.Love it. Love. It
5
We went to Artichoke with some friends for brunch and we literally couldn't keep our hands off each other's plates - the food was SO good. The owner and staff were all working on the floor and were very friendly despite the cafe being super-crowded - much appreciated! The Shakshouka is definitely not to be missed. <
4
@TheKuoKnowsArtichoke has got to be one of the hardest restaurants to find in Singapore. But many can get there without a hitch, as evidenced by the number of diners at brunchtime.So, clearly I need to brush up on my map-reading skills.It is difficult to tell if Artichoke is Greek, Egyptian, Israeli, Tunisian or Turkish. So let's just leave it as...... Middle Eastern, with a Bohemian twist. The casual, and at times, easy-going Bohemian feel about the restaurant really works like a charm. The Lamb Shakshouka is a crowd-pleaser. Who can resist tender lamb, cheese and egg steeped in a rich tomato sauce?The Cauliflower Sabbich is heaven. I never knew that humus, eggs, cheese and cauliflower would go well together. But Artichoke works the combination beautifully.The cauliflower dish is also a superb complement to the lamb, though both can work as stand-alones.Artichoke gets my nod of approval. I highly recommend booking to avoid waiting. And take a map to avoid getting lost
4
This place is an incredibly popular venue, especially for brunch.
The quality of the food is excellent and well worth a try if you're in the area.
5
I have come here a few times. The prawn is especially delicious. Hummus are great too.
Price is reasonable.
5
This restaurant is so special. Every dish hits the mark and the manager was so fun, helping us to order and provising some laughs. The standout dishes are the brussel sprouts, the feta burrata, the beetroot salad, the prawns in harissa cream sauce, the lamb and the beef, every single dish we ordered. OF course, all the dips are off the charts as well. Then we had the gooseberry ice cream and it was incredible. Some of the best food I have had in Singapore. This is a really special restaurant that always delivers very flavoursome dishes. It has a great atmosphere too. You also get handed lollies at the end, which is a really cute touch (and handy for a taxi ride home!!!) Thanks artichoke and keep up the amazing work
4
This was the first place we ate at during our visit to Singapore. It was highly recommended on Google and was close to our hotel. We arrived close to closing time (about 30min before closing) and were able to get a seat outside - thankfully as the music inside seemed very loud. It took quite a while for our order to be taken, we must have waited 15-20min just for drinks, and even longer for the food. But the food, when it did arrive, was very very tasty. We ordered the lamb shakshouka &the pulled duck 'fesenjan' off the brunch menu, both excellent, just a shame about the slow service
1
I have been to Artichoke a few times. I always enjoy the food and my recent visit this past weekend was no different. The service is always a bit messy with staff being confused and slow to clear dishes etc. This was always excusable as the food made up for the service. However, the manager on duty ruined my entire experience by being absolutely rude to us for no reason. We were there for a boozy brunch celebrating a friends birthday, and the manager refused to let us cut our own cake. While there is no policy against bringing a cake, he still refused and was very rude about the whole situation. I doubt I will be back as I don't need to be spoken to in such a way
4
I came here with friends recently and ordered the boatman stew. The stew itself was excellent however for one of the most expensive main dishes on the menu ($26), my portion size was the smallest compared to the other main meals my friends ordered. However, I'd still recommend this restaurant as the food was delicious and left me wanting more. It is advisable to reserve a table prior to your visit though as it was very crowded when we went and thus was had to queue for around 30-45 minutes
5
Good food and friendly staff. Tried several dishes and each dish had a unique special taste. Had the the Artichoke fried chicken, lamb shakshouka , maple glazed bacon chop and finished off with yoghurt muhallebi desert. Prices reasonable for the food quality. Looking forward to returning to tryout other dishes
5
I usually never give 5 stars to a restaurant, it might be because I am picky and vegetarian and restaurants not perfect. But this one is really close to it, so I have to rate it 10/10. The selection isn't the best, but who needs a lot of options when everything is amazing from the menu. The twist in these foods is beautiful, the flavors are exceptional! They made such a good job creating these wonderful dishes and sweets.Definitely go there when you are around
5
Fantastic hang-out place when the weather was cool and breezy. Hummus with warm pita bread was a lovely start to our dinner. Hummus had a tinge of spice and well-balanced mouthful of flavours. The Brassica Tabbouleh was fantastic! What a unique way of eating Brussel sprouts - frying it and mixing it with the plateful of interesting texture and acidity, truly masked the characteristic bitter 'sulphurous' note of these brassica plants. A must try (even if you are not a fan of Brussel sprouts). Smoked chicken was so tender and just loved the smoky tone, which was well-absorbed into the meat. Wagyu beef was soft and juicy, mild roasted flavour and well-complemented by the condiment. The only down-side is I got a few mozzie bites after the mea
5
This is our favourite restaurant in Singapore. This is the place we go to if we want to eat amazing food,. It is consistently outstanding and mouthwatering. We have lived in Singapore for 4 years and over this time we have enjoyed eating here and brining our visitors to dine with us.
4
Great vibe, perfect for brunches lazy weekend. On busy days the staff is a bit slow, but the amazing food makes up for it.
4
This restaurant has really excellent food,busy and a fun place to be.The staff are quick to order your meal and then chase up on it when it didn't arrive.
4
We went to Artichoke for brunch on a Sunday, and were very lucky to manage to get a table without a booking. We weren't sure what time they opened and by chance, we arrived 10 minutes before they opened for brunch and were able to bag a table for two. The place has a great atmosphere, with really interesting decor and a cozy, airy feel to it. We sat indoors and got to experience the buzz of the place (which filled up really fast!). My friend opted for the fried chicken, and I went for the smoked salmon pancake. When her dish arrived, I admit that I was filled with immense food envy as her plate looked pretty epic - amazingly golden-brown, crispy chicken...and the portion was huge. When I got my smoked salmon pancake, my food-envy tapered down a bit as it was very prettily presented and was extremely tasty. The food has all these interesting twists - it's not your average brunch. We were also really impressed with the coffee. I'd definitely recommend a visit however try and make a reservation if you don't want to get caught queuing for your meal - or go early

We used to really love this place, but won't be back. We have been in Singapore for 4 years and have been a regular customer. The food has always been amazing! We had the Lambgazm and spent SGD 800 between 6 of us. The sad thing is that when the bill came out they wouldn't split the bill. They profusely refused splitting the bill between 6 of us.In this modern day and age, who carry's hundreds of dollars on them when going out for dinner? There are a number of us in the F&B industry that were at dinner and have been quite disappointed. The end of the night takes the gloss away from a great night, and amazing food. A few other points we noticed have changed... I would also like to say that the mezze dip plates that came out early in the night have substantially reduced in size. The taramasalata and hummus is smaller than a saucer. And to ruin the night further, one of our guests saw a rat (or mouse) run across the floor in the main room. Sad to see something that used to be so great, fall so hard.

Went with local expats to this restaurant and was pleased with the fantastic food served. Casual atmosphere with very good attentive service. BYO allowed as well as wine list there. All in all would suggest this is a great food destination for middle eastern style cuisine
4
Walked in for late lunch and had seating at the bar counter. The restaurant was warm without Aircon but we noticed the service was also warm and friendly. The menu was a simple brunch and food was also quite simple. The burratta was good but we found the dishes heavy rather salty. We liked the venue so will be back to try dinner at another time.
5
One of the best meals I have had in a long time. We had the smoked swordfish - WOW. They know how to put flavours together. The Wagu beef and the chicken for share plates. Just so much flavour and every mouthful had the mmmmm factor. I can't wait to go back again. Staff were great and explained the food to us with obvious passion
5
Amazing Middle Eastern in Asia, complete with a brick oven.Ask for the "Lambgasm" if you want the biggest piece of Lamb - I've ever seen! MUST BE ORDERED 48 hours in advance.... The dish comes with pita and all the Middle Eastern trims you could imagine...
5
We had the most delicious meals here for dinner with friends. The babaganoush was creamy and so moreish. The beetroot salad was was fresh and so full of flavour. The burratta was a table favourite. We also had the lamb and the fish. All incredible. We sat inside and it was a bit loud but still a lovely restaurant that delivers very tasty food. Will be back again and again
4
We felt the prices were on the high side for the size of the portions. The hummus was the smallest size we have ever seen anywhere in any country. The babaganoush was tasty but not a recipe we would recognise as middle-eastern or mediterranean. The figs, ONE fig cut inti four wedges, was over a spread of goat cheese. Very tasty, but the size was so small it was disappointing. We ordered the duck and the prawns and extra pita bread. The duck tasted like lamb and had a tzatziki sauce and some onions...absolutely delicious but it was NOT duck.We asked the waitress and a another waiter and both said it WAS duck. Impossible. It was NOT duck...the meat was well done, very tender, and most definitely a lamb or beef meat. We eat at Dian Xiao Er and we know duck! Duck has a distinct taste, as does some lamb, but this was either a mild lamb or a beef. The prawns were superb.The wait staff was very nice. Though this place was filled inside and outside, the staff were all genuinely kind and friendly. Yes, the music is loud, but the atmosphere is convivial and fun.We agreed portions are small but we will go back and hope we get the lamb by mistake again! hah
1
Had high hopes - came highly recommended. Went at 621pm. Was told firmly I can't come in because they open at 630. Had a beef dish. Vomitted in the bathroom afterwards. So disappointed - had heard this was a real treat. Disgusting !

Food 10/10
Ambience 7/10
Value 7/10
Had the Lamb shoulder, roast chicken and the wagyu beef. Every dish is perfectly made, render, juicy and full flavour. Highly recommended.
Not a big fan of the ambience though.
5
The lamb shoulder is one of the best lamb meals I have ever had. Simply not to be missed. The char-grilled broccoli was also pretty darned good.
5
This place could have been in Tel Aviv or in Beirut or anywhere else cool in the middle east. They combine authentic cooking with a more classy tone, to create a wonderful meal. Don't miss it when in Singapore.

Went there for a weeknight dinner with my husband and were hugely disappointed. At first glimpse the arty design, laid back atmosphere of the place and the menu looked promising. However, at a closer look the dinner menu turned out to be a list of starters and snacks with tiny portions. Their recommendations on the number of dishes to order for two/three/etc. would send you to at least a hundred dollars per couple (without a single drink!) for some mediocre assortment of finger food (a tablespoonful of tzatziki, seriously?!). The biggest let down was that there was not a single main course or even an artichoke dish which going by the name of the place should be their special. The lamb dish my husband had was good but again, TINY. We left the place with stomacks as empty as our wallets. Will never go back
5
I was so enchanted by this restaurant last night! I went for dinner with 3 girl friends. We had the following food: -starters: hummus / tzatsiki / babaganoush with pita. Excellent quality -mains:  1. lamb shoulder--> this is incredibly tasty and of great quality. The meat was grilled to perfection, the sauce awesome 2. Prawns --> amazing sauce also! Wow. Big prawns (4 pieces of I remember correctly) and I basically licked the bottom of the bowl  3. Burrata feta --> excellent cheese over nice crisp bread -dessert: shared a chocolate ice cream (home made) Such a good dinner and evening. Thank you !
5
This is one of the most exciting place to eat in Singapore. The food and what you taste from the food will surprise you. I have the hummus and the ebiko spread and it was really really good. I loved the ebiko spread. I also had the pork and the duck kebab. The pork was really really succulent and tasty. The duck kebab was good but the star of the show was the yoghurt sauce and fennel. Really delicious. I would come back here in a heartbeat.
5
Have walked past this place at least 50 times saying "we must try that" and tonight we stopped and tried it! After spending a couple of hours there we kicked ourselves for walking past so often! A great selection of mezze and even more interesting food in both style and taste on the main fare list.Can recommend the beetroot, baba ghanoush and the fresh figs were a treat. We tried the octopus (yummy) and duck (different but yummy) and were too full to take on the deserts which looked soooo good.The staff were great, helpful and understood the menu and it was an overall good experience. The outdoor fans created a cooling breeze and the the background music was well chosen and at a volume that entertained but still allowed conversation at normal levels of speech
5
Loved this little place! Amazing food! I love middle eastern and it's hard to come by really good middle eastern, but this place surpassed my expectations. The pita are fluffy and amazing! We've been in SE Asia for 3 weeks and wanted a little break from that flavor profile. I highly recommend artichoke. The owner was there and waited on us, very cute guy. They also gave us homemade sour gummy candy when we left, silly cute touch.
5
If you have not been to this casual bistro style restaurant, you must come to try! The middle eastern influenced cuisine was delicious and done with lots of heart, service was passionate and it had one of the most lively vibe for restaurant in Singapore. Highly recommended
5
We had brunch here. All food that we ordered was good and fantastic. Will definitely come again. Dont forget to prder and try their thick bacon! Very thick and full of flavor bacon.. Never had bacon since that day...
5
The share plates are unique and fabulous. You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the creation of the dishes. There were four of us and we had such a wonderful meal. The atmosphere is friendly and the service outstanding.
5
We were visiting friends and they took us to their favourite restaurant, Artichoke. It is tucked away so you need to know where it is or you could pass it by.We ordered the baba ganoush, lamb and prawns as well as the fig appetizer. They were served with hot pita bread. The dishes were fantastic and not a crumb was left.The service was very good. And we certainly enjoyed this little restaurant
5
Artichoke is a trendy cafe, located a few steps inside from the middle road. Place was full when we reached and taking reservation was a good idea.We ordered 2 mezzes - muhammara and cured sword fish , with pita bread. For mains we had Duck Tacos and Char Grilled Pork. The food was quite flavorful, and we especially liked the muhammara spread and Duck Tacos.Prices are slightly on a higher side , but the cafe's tucked in the corner location - lively atmosphere and great food is a winner.
4
Best humous in Singapore so far! I love the casual setting - both inside and outside. The wine prices were not as outrageous as in some restaurants. Food was good, although the halibut fish fingers a bit on the greasy side. Biggest downside: it was very difficult to get any lactose-free or gluten free dishes for my food intolerant dining partner
4
Coming to Artichoke for any meal means you will have a lot of fun. Period. From the creativity in the dishes, to the creativity in the writing of the menu, to the assortment of dishes to the incredibly knowledgeable and friendly service Artichoke is a top choice for fun, casual dining.The depth of knowledge that Bjorn has on this type of cuisine is astonishing and he brilliantly navigates the spices of one country to the next in order to create dishes that are a fusion of countries more than they are a fusion of cuisines. ALWAYS making sense.Flavors a bold, unapologetic and you will find yourself having rave parties in your mouth at different bites. The portions are also quite large which means you will not leave the restaurant with spaces to fill.Their home-made cream lollies should not be missed since they make for awesome desserts, good to keep kids quiet around boozy parents or for that nice stroll after such a satisfying meal. Go now now now now
5
So, I went with my parents visiting us in Singapore and pre ordered the lamb. The service was good and the restaurant manager (a fan of Dutch t-shirts) was charming, knowledgeable and made us at ease.The starters were very nice but the lamb was out of this world. This is the sixth time I eat here and I will come for more... Well done you all.An hilarious part of our dining experience came from a beer ordered by my father....see picture... Really yumm

This restaurant is one of the best places to go in Singapore if you are looking for relaxed, sociable and utterly delicious food. Definitely take some good chums with you. It won't be a long, languid meal; service is speedy. It will be unctuous meat, tangy cheese, smooth avocado, dippy eggs, earthy mushroom, pokey chilli and all the pita bread you can handle accompanied by some toe tapping tunes. I had a gorgeous dinner there with my just visiting 70 yr old parents. We were craving home cooked, quality produce, comfort food, it was the perfect tonic to a 13 hour flight. We sat in the heat of the garden (by choice), had cold beers and watched the food flying out of the kitchen, wide-eyed. It all looked and smelled so sensational it was almost impossible to choose (we ordered so much we went home with a doggy bag of pork which was still delicious the next day). We had to do a minor shuffle about when the rain came but that's all part of the experience. When I told @fatheroffoodiebrit about the lamb shakshuka that they did for Sunday brunches he tugged my sleeve like a 6 year old and pleaded with me that we make a return visit. I hate to see a grown man cry so I gave in to his demands. It was wonderful to see his expectations well and truly met as he scraped pita bread round his bowl to leave no trace of a meal. Then he gazed longingly at my mothers not yet finished plate. I swear I could hear tiny whimpers that one would normally associate with small dogs. He was so seduced by his shakshuka that he bought a cookbook for himself, and me, and the next door neighbour, and the cat sitter, and......

My colleagues and I had a team dinner at Artichoke one Wednesday. The location is easy to find yet nicely hidden, so you feel like you're walking into a secret garden. Since it was a Wednesday, the place wasn't full and we were pleasantly surprised to be seated at a round table -- which made conversations so much easier since there were 7 of us.The menu wasn't very extensive but the choices were pretty interesting. I don't actually know how to classify Artichoke's cuisine. It was a bit Middle Eastern / Mediterranean, but then you also have other dishes which seem to me like a fusion of other cuisines. Whatever cuisine you classify Artichoke into, I'd say it was overall yummy!We ordered hummus and babaghanoush, together with pita for starters. Loved them, very flavorful, although I didn't expect the pita would be thick. I was probably imagining naan. Then we ordered a few main dishes (can't remember the exact names) -- lamb shakshouka, roasted chicken, creamy prawns and roasted brocolli. Almost everything was sooo flavorful! The lamb meat was so tender, it was falling off the bone. We couldn't get enough of the prawns (although it was challenging to peel off the shell) because it was swimming in yummy creamy sauce. Even the brocolli had flavor in it! The chicken, sadly, wasn't memorable to me.For drinks, most of us didn't order and made full use of the bottles of water they served on the table. Then on the way out, we were each given a small packet of gummies -- took us by surprise, but it was good to wash away a bit of the rich flavors from dinner.But overall, I'd recommend this place if you're looking for something different and rich in flavor. The food and the ambience make it a good date place or an intimate dinner with friends. It's a type of place where you share food, so if you and your friends are the type to each order a dish for yourself, then this place wouldn't fit you. A good number of people would be good so you can try / share a lot of dishes.In terms of price, it's on the high side so I was sooo grateful that the dinner was company sponsored :

If you like loud music, this restaurant may be ok for you. That was the very first impression I had when I entered the restaurant last Tuesday night. Had a dinner gathering with friends at this restaurant then. I would say it was a tad disappointing experience for me as the menu was so so but pricey. Didn't even bother to take any photos of the food either. Literally drown in loud music and unable to conduct s meaningful conversation. The air conditioner or was it the fan, was blowing strongly and directly which made it a chilly evening. Overall this must be one of the few reviews which I am not impressed.
3
The place looks nice, music between jazz and soul was very pleasant, and the beer selection great... while did they have to spoil all dishes with tons of vinaigrette!?
4
Beautiful food. Primarily for couples or groups but works for solo diners too. Pricey but the food is worth it! Perfect for a treat!
1
Arrived 5 minutes before friend..not allowed to sit down and order coffee. Nobody else waiting. Easy way to put someone off coming back.
5
A chef with nice ideas. Tables in the courtyard as well as inside. Affordable and drinkable wine.
Liked the beetroot dish, and the huge prawns.
5
I will not give the address as its a secret worth keeping. I take the family and clients there and they all love it, the staff are all attentive and friendly. The food is freshly prepared and is amazing. The manager, Ronnie, cannot do enough to please everyone, he has a great wine knowledge and always gives my visiting clients some good tips about Singapore. Theres always a special treat as you leave too. Book or get there early for a table inside, sit back and relax with some of their homemade lemonade or a cold beer. For the quality of food and atmosphere the pricing is fair and you wont leave hungry

This is the first time I have offered a review without tasting the food. Without even sitting down at the restaurant!! We went there this morning without a reservation. The lady who greeted us was nice and asked if we had a reservation. When we said no, she said she could only sit us at one of the tables, which was near the walkway and in about 34 degrees with no fan. We asked if we could sit at another table and were told, "sorry all reserved". Our estimations was that at least 80% of tables were unoccupied! This is either fueled by arrogance or an ineffective booking process. Or of course if they were expecting a coach party any time soon. (Although it didn't look the type of place that accepted coach parties). We passed by about 30 minutes later and about half of the tables that were supposed to be "reserved" were unoccupied. Maybe they meant they were reserved for the evening meal? Needless to say we will not venture back.

This was to be my 5th visit to Artichoke. A place I had enjoyed several times previously. I called ahead and asked if they could accommodate my party of 5 which included 2 vegans and a vegetarian. I realise this is not easy so a call ahead to check was worth doing. I was assured this wouldn't be a problem. Got there for dinner and was seated in a place under the speaker system and we proceeded to shout at each other as conversation. Again, this was my 5th visit and first time we'd struggled to converse. I asked the waiter if he could turn the music down a little (it's actually decent music just not conducive to conversation at that volume) and was met with a strict reply - "management have instructed us not to turn down the music". Okaaaaaaaay. Interesting. Then I asked about the vegan menu for my family members who are not omnivores like me. The waiter couldn't hear me over the music (from less than 2 feet away) and said you can sit outside if you like. Clearly if he can't hear me then there is a problem. Anyway, I repeated my vegan request another 2 times before he heard me. He said there were no vegan options. I said that I had called ahead and asked so in a huff he went to to kitchen and came back with the options of a salad or hummus. Really... a cooked meal was not possible... At which time we'd had enough. The prospect of shouting at each other for conversation and then having my family members eat a limited menu when we'd called ahead to check was not acceptable. So I went to the front desk and said we were leaving and would like to have a chat to management to explain why we were leaving. We were instructed to go to their Facebook page. Anyway, enough of my rant. I'm sure the food is still good, but they're not going to get any more of my business with that sort of ambience and attitude. There are plenty of far better restaurants with better ambience and service. Try Bar Roque in Tanjong Pagar. Far superior
1
I was very disappointed with the food. Good menu however the food was completely deep fried and soaked in oil. We had the lamb and Brussel sprouts tabouleh. The amount of oil in our food was much too much, masking the flavour of what I'm sure was originally good produce. The restaurant is in a lovely spot with good ambience and friendly wait staff. It was also overpriced for the quality of the food.
4
We waited around 30 minutes for a table late Saturday afternoon but used it as an excuse to sink a couple of cold beers outside.Unfortunately they has sold out of the salmon, but my second choice of lamb was spectacularly good.Already making plans to return to demolish the "lambgasm" Will probably try weekday evening and hope it's not so crowde
5
Visited Artichoke Cafe on March 6 2016 with my girlfriends for lunch and the food simply blew me away. The ambience was relaxed and the packet of sour gummys offered to us at the end of our meal was a brilliant touch.Highly recommended for brunch however, it would be best to make a reservation prior your visit as waiting for a seat under the afternoon sun is really no joke.Get the Cauliflower Sabbach, it will change your life!! The fried chicken and lamb shasouka were really good too. My friends throughly enjoyed the lemonade and overall, we had a very nice afternoon.Thank you Artichoke, I will definitely be back
4
Came with a group of friends and feasted on the roast lamb (advance notice required) and assorted mezzes. Restaurant was quiet probably as it was a week night.
5
Love their brunch, I try to go once per month. Coffee is also really nice here.
Make sure you reserve or come in early!
4
Great little restaurant. We always sit outside and then just order as much off the menu as possible. The food is really good. Service is standard Singapore level and friendly but one goes there for the food.
5
The food here is fantastic! We ordered the lambgasm, smoked chicken, cauliflower and mezzos to share. Everything was top notch. I still crave the chicken from time to time. Great place to bring friends and family for birthdays, special occasions or just to treat yourself to a good meal. A bit pricy but worth the dollar. Wait staff are friendly. But be sure to call and reserve a table first
4
Dined here last month with my family for brunch and before I write about the food, let me write about their flawed reservation system. I would have skipped this part but I'm forced to write about it after reading their cocky statement which said they have all the rights to deny a seat for someone who challenges their reservation system. I believe with a flawed system, they're making a joke about themselves. Just as I walked in, there was a barricade with a sign board that says those with reservation should proceed to the counter while the rest join the queue which was a pretty simple and clear instruction. I promptly joined the queue and waited almost twenty minutes and watched a couple walk-in and give their name at the counter and walked away. Feeling confused, I asked the staff at the counter what's going on and he replied that alI the walk-in customers are supposed to give their name, number of pax and wait outside till the staff call their name. Just for the record, this wasn't written anywhere nor conveyed.Guess what? There was one group of 5 members and three couple waiting in the queue behind me without knowing that they were supposed to give their names and all of them were upset about it. Either follow what is written or write what is being followed. It's as simple as that. I did put my point across to the staff at the counter and he agreed and gave me an outdoor table right away. They promptly offered a table indoors once it was available as we had a toddler with us. Brownie points for good service.We ordered cauliflower sabiach, fried chicken, fresh lemonade, a cup of cappuccino and mocha. The cauliflower sabiach came with two pita bread slathered with hummus, topped with crispy florets of subtly spiced fried cauliflower, a smoked egg, a generous serving of salad by the side and two dips for the pita bread. The dish was simply awesome. The fried chicken came along with a crunchy bed of salad with citcrus dressing and crispy bite-sized hash browns. This dish was spot on too! The lemonade was really refreshing and the bits of pomegranate gave a nice twist to the classic drink. The cappuccino and mocha were fantastic as well.Overall, food was excellent and staff were polite, efficient and attentive. The food is reasonably priced too. I would have given five stars if not for the messed up wait-for-a-table system. Keep up the great food and good service guys but please, work on a proper system for those walking-in customers.
4
Really relaxing ambience coupled with outstanding and interesting food options. There is nothing not like about this place.Drinks could have a little more variety though.Overall, a great place to wind down after a hard day's work or to catch with friends over a weekend brunch. We just keep coming back and possibly, so will you !

We chose Artichoke as a venue as recommended by my Daughter in her twenties.A bit hard to find tucked behind the little former chapel on the corner of Waterloo Street but that was soon sorted. We loved the ambience and the round table initially but soon realised that we couldn't hear each other so the round table was no help to conversations. This was due to the fairly loud music and the noise of everyone else trying to talk above the music. As the restaurant got emptier it improved but I was quite surprised when I asked if the volume could be reduced as the music was still quite loud but I was refused. The food was ok but the impression that remains is the frustration of gathering with friends and then not being able to talk. Wrong choice of venue I gues
3
We did not make any reservation but managed to get seat being there before 12p. The place was packed, they have been doing very good job in marketing, I am one that is intrigued by glowing reviews of this place, even after having less than delicious in Bird Bird which is Bjorn's other restaurant.We had huevos rancheros which was good and Artichoke's fried chicken. It was succulent but the coleslaw was tasteless, and hash brown was tad too oily and too filling as companion. Bacon was not a good quality, can't taste the maple glazed either. Orange juice is not freshly squeezed.Nevertheless, glad to have a restaurant that offer different brunch than eggs ben and/or waffle pancake. Other mains, perhaps the more Mediterranean ones look more promising
5
Great little hidden gem in Singapore. When I say hidden, it sort of is. Located on the corner of middle road and waterloo street. Look for the little yellow church and its behind that. Food is middle eastern inspired and to die for. The venue itself is very laid back and almost bohemian. Well priced and well worth the visit
5
I visited artichoke after reading some online reviews. This is a bar/restaurant hidden between two buildings; i missed it the first time round! Place: relaxed atmosphere, tables in and outside. Think upmarket shack in a good way! I sat at the bar. Fairly busy when I went but no prob getting a table. However, am sure gets busier on Fri/sat evenings. Food: I had the lamb shashouk. It was delicious, very comforting on a rainy afternoon. Really cheered me up to! Drinks: I only had lime juice this time, but looks like plenty to offer in terms of alcoholic beverages. Service: with a smile, very efficient. All in all a great find, something a bit different for Singapore, I will definitely be going back!
5
We were able to have a great meal that was vegetarian at Artichoke. The hummus was outstanding, as was the feta/fig appetizer. Additionally, the falafel was very good. Great atmosphere and excellent music - what more could you ask for in Singapore!
5
If you are curious or would like to satisfy your cravings for quality Middle Eastern food in Singapore, look no further! Artichoke will certainly not disappoint! Try the Mezze plates, which are more like appetizers to share. Tried the Hummus, Fresh Figs and they really go well with the warm Pita bread! For the shared plates, must try are the chargrilled pork belly, slow roasted lamb shoulder, smoked chicken and hot skillet prawns. For desserts, do try their ice cream pops! Excellent sweet ending to your meal. Reservations is highly recommended. Service was attentive and prompt
4
The place offers middle eastern fusion brunch. I had the Cauliflower Sabbich which was quite good. The smoked egg served with it was excellent. I loved the relaxed environment. The place itself seems to be in a small house kind with a front yard and has seating outside for good weather. A perfect place for friends to meet over for brunch
5
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times over the past few years, both for weekend brunch and weekday dinner, and it's a gem. They specialise in eastern Mediterranean and middle eastern food. Their house-made hummus is excellent, as is the haloumi, burrata, hot skillet prawns and almost everything on the menu. Some dishes incorporate spices grown in their own spice garden. They are serious about their food, treat their team well and their regular customers like family. The prime brunch tables are those in the open air courtyard, but for dinner the indoor tables are just as cozy. Highly recommended
4
A lot of the dishes seem middle eastern at this place, but they were all quite good. I had the haloumi cheese with mushrooms, which was excellent and tiramisu latte, which had a very nice distinct flavor. There was a signature dish on the menu, fried chicken type of thing, which i found very heavy and too much work for breakfast. Prices are mid-range, quite similar to orchard road places. For bugis area and further away from the city i would expect prices to be slightly lower. Anyway, it is still a good place to try
4
The menu ranges from western comfort (eg. grilled cheese sandwiches, egg & bacon breakfast) to Chinese (chargrilled pork belly) to Mediterranean (falafel, tzatziki, hummus) and there are usually specials. The food is generally tasty and we've never been disappointed. 1/2 of the seating is outdoors with fans for comfort. It comes with loud music but, to be fare, they include "loud" in their self-description. They used to have an outlet selling various and delicious bakalava though this has been replaced with homemade flavourful popsicles. Fun if you don't want to have a serious conversation. Won't bankrupt you, either. Make a reservation if you want to be seated. Oh, they won't substitute or eliminate items for you (dairy, etc), which I applaud, but be forewarned and if you are picky about gluten and other popular food issues just order items that don't naturally come with those
5
I have so many things to say about this place but Ill keep it short. It will make your day. First and most importantly to me, the folks there are nice and attentive, kind and gracious. The location and ambience of this place is perfect - you feel relaxed and comfortable in spite of being in the city centre. And you cannot come to this place and leave without trying these two dishes - Haluomi and Mushrooms & Cauliflower Sabbich. Fresh, tasteful, exciting and indulgent. Bravo
4
Tucked away behind the Center for Photography is this wonderful Middle eastern restaurant. Rustic bare tables and picnic benches filled with great blues, craft beer, wonderful ciders, and amazing dishes to share with friends and family. Everything is delicious. The atmosphere, the food, and the drinks are all wonderful. A "roll up your sleeves and dig in" sort of place - can't wait for our next visit!
4
I've visited a couple of times for Sunday lunch/brunch. Both times ignored by the waitress at the front entrance for a few minutes at least. Yes I can see they are busy but they see us standing there and no greeting or smile at all. Either pretty poor training or a serious lack of common sense, most likely the latter.Food-wise it's good, the lamb the veggie option and salmon sandwich were pretty good. Price-wise it's a bit much, considering 2 small pieces of grilled haloumi will set you back over S$10.Funky interior and a decent busy vibe, even if at times you feel like you have been waiting a bit too long. All in all it's fine once you get in and the food in front of you
5
Went here for brunch on weekend after being recommended by our friend - we waited for almost 30 mins, we looked at the menu and OMG everything looks delicious! After contemplating for what to eat for a bit, I ended up ordering the mushroom & avocado while my boyfriend had the 4 grilled cheese sandwich and our other friend had the lamb something something (couldn't remember the exact menu) and a side of scramble eggs.It looked as good as it tasted. We finished our plates in no time! It was that good that the boys ended up buying the cookbook!Definitely one of the must try places in Singapore
5
Sensational food great wine and excellent service.
Great selection of food and off menu wine. Happening place will go back!
5
outstanding food and service. great selection and the staff is helpful and attentive. recommend ordering several starters and mains and sharing.
5
Being from the Middle East originally, it was nice to see some Middle Eastern dishes with a Singaporean take on the menu. Fun setting, nice branding and great music. Will be back!
5
We live close by and love an evening in artichoke.
Never very impressed at lunch time but the dinner menu is fantastic.
4
Fancy a Middle eastern/Mediterranean meal in Singapore? Well, I did and damn was I impressed! The best of it is that the chef is not from any of these regions but a local Singapore chef named Bjorn. He calls it dude food lol. The place is unpretentious, rustic and feels like how it should be eating this kind of food.I highly recommend their sharing plates which you must try the hummus as well as the seasonal specials which is changed regularly. The pita bread was freshly toasted so it tasted nice. Must try is the grilled burrata cheese and the lamb shoulder which was tender and juicy. Chef mentioned they changed their menu regularly. I love this place and the food! A must try if you visit Singapore
5
Being greedy, I really wish no one else knew of this place. It's the one restaurant I crave over and over. Living in Singapore I try to get here as often as I can. I've been for dinner, which is delicious, but nothing beats brunch. I can't get enough of the lamb shakshuka
2
Unfortunately very disappointing for me (although others in my group enjoyed it). In summary, no fried cauliflower with pomegranate, no lemon chicken, no fried chicken, no dark chocolate and almond baklava. Instead consistently salty meat dishes and few healthy vegetables. Expensive. I won't be back.In summary, no fried cauliflower with pomegranate, no lemon chicken, no fried chicken, no dark chocolate and almond baklava.

First thing I noticed (and really liked) about Artichoke is the hipster vibe it gives off soon as walk around the corner heading towards the entrance. I don't think it looks that memorable at daytime, but at night, it's certainly a good place to have dinner and chill with friends. Food is great and the sharing portion is quite sufficient. They serve some Mediterranean-inspired dishes along with some fusion cuisine. We ordered woodfire BBQ pork ribs, Artichoke fried chicken and hot skillet prawns - all of which, we loved to bits. They don't have good dessert choices though, except for popsicles, so if you are celebrating an occasion (birthday, anniversary, etc), you may bring your own store-bought cake. When we were there the other night, a friend of ours brought homebaked brownies as it was one of our friends' birthday and one of the restaurant staff wasn't exactly very good-natured about it. In any case, we were still allowed to eat the brownies because they weren't very clear about the exception when we called beforehand. So that was a bit of a turn-off. But otherwise, the food and the dining experience were fantastic

Lovely, imaginative food with fresh ingredients and inspired by the levant. This was a recommendation of a colleague as I was in from out of town. The location is handy for the Singapore Art Gallery, Design Centre, and National Library.The owner chatted to me at the bar, was very welcoming, introducing me to his staff of eclectic origin. Lovely relaxed atmosphere. A place to relax with great food

Service level need to be improved. We asked for the bill twice as response is slow. By the 2nd time we asked for the bill, we observed the waiter gave only lip service, but took no action. Ended up bringing the bill to the cashier. Cashier (we think he's the manager) took our bill without a word. Wow.

We had a very nice dinner at Artichoke. Service was good, as was the food. True southern mediterranean flavours. Too bad that two of the main dishes on the menu -which was already quite limited- were not available.
5
Found this place by accident. Was roaming around for a quick eat on my short holiday in Singapore. One of the most amazing dinners i ever had.

Went to Artichoke for dinner with friends. Nestled in a quaint corner in the mist of buzzing Singapore, this place is a real find. Limited menu but each dish is fantastic. Great wine and a loverly feel overall.
4
A fresh change in the restaurant scene with a decent menu for diners in singapore. Small dishes simmilar to tapas but fills you up. The lamb and salads are exceptionally tasty. Generally everything we ordered didn't disappoint. The courtyard is both casual and special at the same time. It can get a little warm.though. The range of desserts can also be a bit wider.

Getting in close to the time the kitchen closes due to road closures in the city, the staff were a bit flustered about whether we would be able to get a table, but then took a good 15 mins to come and take our order. When they did, they tried to rush us saying the kitchen would close soon, but they accepted tables after ours and we were ready to order 5 mins after being seated!Food was great, had 3 dishes to share between the 3 of us. They were very well cooked, and good sized portions, the fried chicken was amongst the best I've had. The place is kind of funky, relaxed and a fun place to be, the music was an interesting choice, kind of funky, adding to the vibe of the place.An enjoyable experience and one that I am happy to recommend, the service just needs to be given a bit more attention to match the standard of the food

We had heard good things from a local Singaporean & wanted to try something different. The menu looked good & we braced ourselves for the service issues. Even tho we had a reservation, the owner/host refused to seat us any where but the deck, but the ambiance seemed ok (curiously, the inside never filled) The menu was enticing & we ordered a small dish to share. That's when we saw the largest rat (I'm from NYC so I know something about sewer rats!) scurry past our table from the planter box perimeter down the alley toward the bathrooms! My friend is bolder than I & went to the edge to look, and saw it go down the drain opening. Again, we appealed to move inside & we debated leaving. But the food was good & maybe the rat was gone - but no! He came back about ten minutes later! And looked around the deck before vanishing under the planter box! This time we were moved inside as we were preparing to leave... The rest of the evening was quiet with great food & the service was better as we were right next to the bar, so we could flag someone when we needed something. The food was really great, and I might even go back but I would only sit inside!! (Interestingly enough, the inside tables never filled up, we think the owner like a crowd on the deck to attract more business?

This was my 1st dinner here, after many weekend brunches, & it didn't disappoint. We shared the Slow Roasted Lamb Shoulder (with Zhong coriander sauce, toum garlic, tomatoes & "dirty" onions) & the Housemade Feta "Burrata" which was awesome. Red wine by the glass had limited choices (well, only 1) but food is why your here. Next time will be with a bigger group, as the "Lambgasm" for 5 at the table beside us looked amazing, & the noises said it tasted as good as it looked. Love this place
3
It's such a shame that the service lets down the experience at this otherwise terrific restaurant. The food is absolutely fantastic - especially the feta burrata and the harissa prawns - and the general ambience is good. We visited on a Friday night and sat outside. Despite the restaurant not being full, we got almost no assistance all night. We had to constantly flag people down to order and despite ordering wine before our food, both mezze and mains had arrived well before the drinks. This was disappointing, especially after asking twice and watching up to 5 people (5!!) standing around behind the bar apparently without anything to do. We asked for one more glass of wine as they were taking last orders, only for it never to arrive. When we asked where it was, they said the bar was closed! I would consider coming back just because of how good the food was, but be prepared with low expectations for the service

If you're up for a place that dishes out robustly flavoured, middle-eastern inspired dishes, you'll definitely want to pay this place a visit. My friends and I have been here for brunch and dinner several times since they've opened their doors and there's not been a single meal where we left disappointed.Their huge, almost 3 kilo slow-roasted lamb shoulder, appropriately named "Lambgasm" - typifies what to expect here. No pretense, just good food in generous portions to share. If you're here for brunch, the Maple-glazed fried chicken, lamb shakshouka and the Haloumi & Mushrooms are firm favourites - make sure you get an order of their thick-cut bacon "chop" alongside - a generous half inch thick slab of pork belly that's pretty much a "steak" on its own.The dinner menu here is far more extensive, and no less satisfying. The incredible Lambgasm is only available for dinner, and if you have a party of 4 or more meat-addicts, this is a MUST-try. Fall-off-the-bone tender and incredibly flavourful, it absolutely deserves its name and pride of place on the list of dinner delights.Overall, a definite place to go for awesome comfort food when you're in the mood for it

A much older review since I didn't get round to doing so in November 2013 but decided to give this cafe a try. Turned out to be a wonderful venue for birthday celebration, cosy and tasty dinner. The appetiser platter was amazing. We shared several mains and each dish was cooked really well. For a Mediterranean food lover, I had no complaints!I would recommend it for romantic dinners/ casual dining with friends
5
I've been to Artichoke more than 5x now, for both brunch and dinner and I've never been disappointed each time. Middle Eastern influenced with fresh produce locally sourced, I will possibly have brunch there every weekend if I live down the block. My fave dish has got to be the Feta Burrata on Turkish Toast - creamy salty cheese topped with a touch of basil and sweet refreshing pomengrante on toasted Turkish bread. Must-try! I've tried most of the other brunch dishes as well and they are also good. Dinner is more communal, I usually pick 2 dips with pita bread to start and will share 1 or 2 mains depending on how hungry me and my friends are. The vibe here is casual and very charming, with a lovely courtyard. The staff are friendly and polite, always pleasant and welcoming. I'm already looking forward to go back for yet another satisfying meal. Two thumbs and toes up

Recommended by a friend to host a small gathering here over the weekend brunch. I made bookings a week in advance after being disappointed at the 40 mins queue the last walk-in try. Delighted we were seated in the well lighted mini courtyard area as I noted the dark areas which would been harder to take pictures. Things we loved were the portions, decent flavours and presentation. Service was brisk even with a constant crowd. We had three Lamb Shakshouka, Artichike Fried Chicken, Smoked Salmon Balik Ekmek and Halloumi & mushrooms to share. We should have ordered one main less as the portions were big and very filling for the lamb. The lamb is definitely something you should order, no worries about it having a strong scent. The fried chicken is crispy goodness with the skin being the highlight though I wish the inner flesh would have gotten some of that marinate. Energetic hip vibe, music is pub-like loud so conversations had to be a few decibels higher resulting is a lively chatter and laughter of sorts. Not for those seeking a quiet unwind though I think the outside seats would fare better in the noise department
5
My 3rd visit in 2 years & I wonder why I don't come here more often (booking essential). As a lover of Shakshouka, Artichoke has the best I've ever had anywhere (sorry Melbourne). The shredded lamb is delicious & sets it apart from all other Shakshouka's.My partner had the Fried Chicken & again loved it. The sauces were brilliant (esp. Garlic aioli) & I stole most of the great coleslaw. Coffee was also great, & ambience as alive / loud as always.
5
In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. We went there twice during our time in Singapore and the food is sooo good, unusual and casual atmosphere, extraordinary flavors and not comparable to any other restaurant. You can tell the cook really does his own thing which is why that place is so special to me. We had the Brussel sprouts and the lamb with out a bread and babaganoush and the prawns and the cheese the second time. Everything is to share and has that special touch to it. I was really happy to find something so different in Singapore...a true gem

Went on a Saturday night with some friends who are mega foodies - we all loved the place and will be back soon- arriving by cab,it is corner middle street/Waterloo street behind yellow church- courtyard is very cosy,quite a few tables outdoor,lovely ambience- food. We shared a few dishes,absolute highlights- lamb- falafel- prawns Delicate spices,good sized portions,friendly staff,lovely ambience and clean toilets and great company - my ingredients for a great night ou

I totally agree with my fellow TripAdvisers regarding the management's poor attitude. From the moment you start queuing to the moment you pay for your bill you just feel like your a massive inconvenience to all the waiters. Service is super slow, menu offers very little choices, beverages are a complete disasters, everything being also overpriced. Walk away from this place, plenty of other better alternatives around

I went to Artichoke for brunch & it was a sweaty experience. If you want to have a meal in cooler surroundings, it's best to make a reservation. Otherwise be prepared to sweat it out in one of the outside tables. Dinner would probably be a better bet.Artichoke serves a middle eastern influenced menu. Some dishes are flavorsome, others not so successful. The cauliflower sabbich was delicious with chargrilled cauliflower on a pita base with hummus and a smoked egg. I'd heard great things about their fried chicken but honestly was not won over. The chicken was moist though but the coating was overwhelmingly crispy, over fried almost. Love the coleslaw & pickled vegetables that accompanied it as well as the paprika fries better.Strangely the restaurant has done away with its desserts during brunch, opting to offer only popsicles. We decided to have coffee & dessert elsewhere. Service was perfunctory but not friendly. I may return for dinner but brunch would not be an option for me

I ordered Artichoke Fried Chicken. The chicken was so raw, I was sad that the staff were allowed raw fried chicken to leave the kitchen. When I explained politely and asked for a solution so nobody left the table with hurt feelings, the waiter replied with a nasty face: "That's the way we cook chicken here. But if you want, I will send it back to the kitchen " For the record, the chicken was pink, fleshy color. When it was sent back, unsurprisingly, it was over cooked.Besides the chicken, all breads ( smoked salmon sandwiches) were over baked and turned black at one side as well. All the black sides were turned up side down on the plate.I am aware of the fact that in Singapore it is not easy to find a waiter/waitress/restaurant/bar with smiling faces or nice attitude pp. Well, being in this industry is not easy for many pp. So, farewell Artichoke, I will never ever spend my time and my money with you again

Went for lunch with my wife and waited for a good 20 minutes before we got an outdoor table for 2 near the entrance. The seats indoor are limited, so reservation is recommended if you prefer to have your meal away from the typical Singapore hot humid weather....The Cauliflower Sabbich is marvelous!!! The cauliflower and onion are fried till it is a little burnt and that brought out the sweetness (& a little bitter taste too). it is topped with slices of cucumber, cherry tomatoes, rockets, avocado, and served on 2 slices of pita bread with humus and some white soury cream spread respectively. The blend of taste is heavenly!!! I have never had vegetarian food that tasted so good!!!The Holoumi n Mushroom is good too. The grilled Holoumi (a Cypriot semi-hard, unripened cheese made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk) is a little salty and goes well with the local mushroom. The bread is nicely toasted and there is a generous serving of avocado hummus too. It is good, but we still prefer the Cauliflower...As the servings were big and we were looking to escape from the afternoon heat, we decided to skip dessert and coffee.... but we will be back for more main course and dessert when we can have indoor seat or dinner.....We spent S$ 52 for 2 main course

My wife and me are visiting all the nominees Rising Chef of the Year from WGS. After Anti:dote, and before going on with Dibs, Morsels and Saha, it was the turn for Artichoke.We decided to go on Sunday morning and try the brunch. That was a very good idea, though I am pretty sure that Artichoke is also a good place for dinner.Food is middle-eastern influenced, but don't expect kebabs and hummus. Chef Bjorn is doing his best to offer a very interesting menu, and he totally succeed. And not only the food is good, also service is much better than usual, being in Singapore. We went with a couple of friends, so, being four people, we could share and try different dishes. Everything was outstanding and satisfied not only our palates but also our bellies. Special mention to the manager of Artichoke, a very nice guy. Ambiance was also interesting, with a very good selection of music and proper decoration.So, our Rising Chef route is going perfectly. Next week we will visit Dibs, in Duxton Road. Modern Asian Tapas by a local chef. After the experiences in Anti:dote and Artichoke, expectations are high. Let's see if Dibs first, and then Morsels and Saha, can satisfy them
5
Middle-Eastern food with a modern twist, in semi-industrial surroundings. Good staff, great food and a bill that doesn't make you wince.
5
A delightful semi outdoor restaurant in the courtyard of Sculpture square, it is breezy and well away from the traffic noises and fumes outside.
Food is Arabic/Turkish influenced without being purist, and the mezze plate and lamb excellent. Service is chirpy and prices reasonable.
5
This is definitely in my Singapore top five. Here's why:* Highly original flavor - They create combinations of flavors in the dishes that I've never experienced elsewhere. The lamb dishes are quite good, but we keep coming back to the burrata, the beet salad, and the sultan's delight. I've eaten here several times, and the food is so unique and so good each time that my wife and I usually end up spending most of the meal just talking about how much we like what we're eating* Ambiance - It's got a really good vibe--from the lighting to the soundtrack to the location tucked away behind an old church building. Sets things up nicely. Even when the restaurant's full, I don't get the feeling like I've got to shout across the table or the wait staff are clinging on for life until the volume of customers subsides* Personality - These guys aren't pretentious in their awesomeness, but they know their stuff when it comes to food and they're excited to share it with you. We picked up their founder's cookbook and it's one of our favorite culinary reads. They hand you gummy candies on the way out. It's fun quirky
4
First of all, this restaurant/cafe is a hidden gem with unusual & ecletic & interesting settingSecondly, love the Vittorio coffee available here. Just like in Australia!Third, food quality is decent and menu is interesting enough Fourth...price wise its a bit steep...eventhough the overall good experience made it more palatable....Overall it is a good place to relax, if you are allright with the prices

We did not make any reservation and the restaurant was fully booked on a Saturday night (21 March 2015) by 6.30pm. Service staff at the door managed to offer us a table for 3 as we agreed to leave before 8.15pm as the table has been reserved for 8.30pm.We really like the Slow Roasted Lamb Shoulder. I feel that the yoghurt and pickled cucumber compliments the lamb really well making the tender lamb really enjoyable.3 of us order a serving of pita bread (2 pcs), hummus and babaganoush as mezze and slow roasted lamb shoulder to share. The young long hair waitress taking our order wasn't very friendly and even came across bossy. She insisted that what we ordered was not enough. I explained that we aren't too hungry so I asked about the serving size. She did not try to explain the size but repeated herself that it is not enough sounding irritated. We insisted that that's all we are ordering as we've been eating the whole day and told her that we'll order more if it is insufficient. Then we asked for iced water without ordering any drinks, she rolled her eyes and walked off to process our order.In the end, we had enough to feed all 3 of us for what we ordered and did not have to order more.The waitress needs to be taught to respect the customer's decision because we know what we need better than her and even though she might not agree with our choices, she doesn't leave a good impression for paying customers by showing her disrespect not matter how subtly she did it through her language or facial expression. This rating is 3 instead of 4 because of my unpleasant experience with the waitress who took our orders.We left by about 7.30pm
4
Our Artichoke experience in truth did not start all that well with a very abrupt reservations person.Having read the reviews we were 50:50 as to whether we cancelled but decided what the hell and went anyway and glad we did.From the moment of our arrival the service was courteous and efficient but also precise-there is to be be no faffing around here.Know what you want to order or wait until you do before calling the wait staff or (understandably) they will go and serve somebody else while you make your mind up.This place is always full and busy remember so fair enough. Drinks came quickly and we ordered the halloumi and mushrooms with Turkish toast and lamb shakshouka. The food is a very innovative mix of various Middle Eastern cooking including Turkish,Lebanese but not as you know it.Portions are big here so two dishes are very adequate for two for brunch.The lamb was generous with a nice spicy tang while the halloumi with mushrooms is a great combination. The place is eclectic sure,even rustic,with good old 1970's R&B playing in the background making for a good chilled out atmosphere and all the better for it-Singapore needs more down to earth rustic places like this serving such good food. Frankly don't know what some of the critical reviewers experienced but for us this place was a success and we will go back,probably for dinner

My family and I went to have brunch on a Sunday as we were around the vicinity. We did not make any reservations and by 1130am there was already a queue forming. We were later informed that reservations should be made around 2 weeks in advance to avoid disappointment. Nonetheless, as we were early we managed to get a table. As we walked into the patio/ garden area, it seems like you were brought into a different world. It reminded me a little of the time we were in Perth... a laid-back ambience where people chatted and dined alfresco. The difference is that in Singapore the weather is a little too hot and humid, there is almost always a queue at good places, and the dining experience seemed a little hurried. Perhaps the alfresco experience would have been better in the cool late evening. I think the most memorable part of our dining experience is the food. The portions are quite large and aesthetically pleasing. Oh yes, and they taste good too. We had a nice thick piece of bacon and shredded lamb. The homemade garlic dip was memorable too. So if you do want to check this place out, do remember to make a reservation (maybe about 2 weeks in advance). It's not a really big place to begin with especially with the crowds coming in
5
As Singapore's most restaurants are in towers, malls and all closed, I really liked this place amidst the gigantic city a place surrounded by arbores with a gentle breeze and a varied and delicious Cardapio. The beer also very rich have proven the Litte Creature and very good. Super recommended to couples seeking a little more privacy or friends who want to have a good time. What I liked most is that the output of the restaurant make you a present ... hahaha a bag of sulces, a nice touch. When I return to Singapore sure I'll be right there

My comment was that this restaurant definitely doesn't have a very good service because when we came down there yesterday (1st Feb) they only had eggs left to offer from the menu although they were happy to keep us waiting for a table for more than 20 minutes. Six of us (3 adults, 2 young adult and sadly 1 toddler) went down for late lunch and were asked to wait 20 minutes to get our table. Once we got the table and waited to be served for almost 10 minutes, we were told that half of the food on the menu (which is a very short menu if you must know) no longer available. Hunger & the promise of good food from the review made us stayed and ordered what were left on the menu only to get the Best News 5 minutes later: What we ordered were also gone and they only had the options of Eggs with Mushroom or Eggs with Bacon. It is shocking that they didn't even have the decency to tell their patiently waiting customers (with a hungry toddler too!) that they basically run out of foods to sell? When we complained the waitress suggested us to go to other cafes near by. I found it very funny - they should have said that at first place & ended the service for the day! I think there are other restaurants with good review that still value customers better so we will not come back

A friend and I were visiting Singapore from the Bahamas and on our last day there decided to have brunch at Artichoke. Since we usually restrict ourselves to local fare when we visit a place, the choice of a Middle Eastern inspired place in Singapore was an unusual for us--but we are very, very glad we went; this was one of our best food and service experiences in Singapore without a doubt, if not the best. We had no reservation, but arrived early enough to be seated for Sunday brunch anyway; the crowds of people coming and waiting suggested the restaurant's popularity and when the food arrived (swiftly considering the crowds) we could see why--it was all excellent--beautifully presented, flavorful, imaginative. We had the smoked salmon pancake, the bacon chop, slushies, mimosas, the coffee date pudding and lemon cake speckled with sumac plus Decor and music hip, bold. We sat outside and so didn't get to experience much of the interior, but that was fine.All of this would have been fine enough, but Ronnie, the manager came over and spent perhaps ten or fifteen minutes talking to us about food, our experiences, the restaurant and its mission and such--and he made quite a few good recommendations. It was a very friendly restaurant, and when we left with our gummi bears and some more overdoughs pastry for the road, we very very pleased. highly recommended. I'd definitely come back and send others there

Have been here a few times, and have always had enjoyable food, the dishes are interesting, and they have great sangria!
5
It is a bit of a walk from the museum area. However, it has a wonderful atmosphere. We went a couple of times for dinner. The atmosphere is so relaxing. Middle Eastern food is for the hummas, the lamb and the fish. Obviously nice meaty, hearty food. Yet it is not expensive. Only compliant is that a lot of the ice had melted into the Sangria so too diluted and little alcohol.
1
Long wait for no reward.They were willing to consider doing anything for vegetarians apart from mushrooms in pita....might want to rethink that guys. There was one option with cauliflower but this was fried with the same oil they cook the chicken in!Nothing for kidsMusic far too loud.
1
This is my local kind of weekend brunch and this is my opinion 1 - food is delicious no doubt2 - super busy over the weekend hence the owner/staff do NOT care about the customers they way they tell you to wait is basically go away we are busy - i walked out twice and the third time i decided that i should write a review about this bad attitude. I hope the management should read the review and do something about their customer service issue because around this areas there are so many good cafes/restaurants with much better servic

I have been to artichoke before. It's a simple and honest restaurant that doesn't pretend to be something they aren't. My personal favourite is the dish with halloumi. Their menu changes. Recently, I tried the Cauliflower Sabbich. The fried cauliflower was delicious and the dish has a unique and sensational taste! The service is great. I had booked a table for 4 but ended up having 6 people. They were very accommodating even though the place was packed as always. Great place
5
A bit disappointed that I hadn't found out about this place before. The appetizer selection was actually brought to the table. We tried most of them and we're glad that we did. The main courses - lamb, pomfret and veggies were all of the same, high standard. We had several desserts between us from a wide selection in a display outside and the sticky date pudding and Turkish style pastries were excellent. Service was faultless and the prices quite reasonable. The only suggestion I would make would be to improve the comfort of the hard seating. A few more cushions would definitely not go amiss, otherwise all good
2
We had heard so much about the cafe we decided to try this on a weekend. The crowd was mostly sub-30's and the place was lively. However, they were playing loud music through a very noisy system and it was a big pain on the ears. On request to turn it down, they said it was their policy to play it that way to attract a certain segment of customers! Apparently they are succeeding given their reviews. The food menu was European fusion with moderate prices for a branch, Scrambled eggs and bacon chop was S$ 20, Thai KFC (?) was S$ 24 and sides between S$4 and S$ 10. We ordered for a ordered for a Thai KFC and bacon chop. While the former was a typical eastern fried chicken, the bacon chop was salted to the core and had to be wasted. Interestingly, the place also sells a cookbook for S$ 44.90 warning you of 'ridiculous recipes' and 'foul language' - no thank you!In summary I would say that the place had potential but perhaps loud noisy music and salted recipes are not for me
5
We stopped by on a Tuesday night around 8pm and had no problem getting a table. The staff were extremely friendly, the menu varied and well- priced (8$ for starters). The sangrias were good- we tried a glass of red and white. There was no fruit or ice like I normally make it with, but they were tasty. We loved the hummous and the beetroot tzaziki with warm pitta bread. We then ate a delicious baked fish, and a beef dish- both full of flavours.I'd love to go back with a froup and order more things to share

We'd been planning to try Artichoke for the longest time and after finally making reservations for a Sunday brunch, we were raring to go. We ordered the Scrambled Eggs & Mushrooms, Cauliflower Sabbich, a beer, and a Brothers Toffee Apple Cider. The Scrambled Eggs were fluffy and delicious, the mushrooms were roasted to just the right texture and were minimally flavoured which brought out the lovely "mushroomy" flavour, the pan fried Halloumi was awesome - just wish there were more of it on the plate, the rocket salad was nicely dressed with a hint of sweet to balance the bite, and the Pita bread was warm and soft.The Cauliflower Sabbich was an experience in itself - deliciously seasoned and fried cauliflower, with a Mixed Israeli salad, topped with yummy hummus and labneh, and tonnes of fresh herbs - this was sheer brilliance!The dishes are definitely priced a tad high, however, the portions are enormous. Order a couple of dishes and share, that way you'll get to taste all the deliciousness. The ambiance is casual and un-fussy, the staff is friendly, and the service is prompt. What I really liked is that we were not rushed at all - neither while ordering nor after we finished our meal. That sort of unhurried atmosphere is quite difficult to find in restaurants here. I definitely will go back, particularly to try the awesome sounding Burrata

I was taken to Artichoke by my wife for a surprise birthday dinner. It has been on my list to try after I discovered the cookbook in a local bookstore. Flicking through the book at the time I thought to myself that this was the kind of food that I like to both cook and eat myself so hence added it to my 'wishlist'. Anyway, arriving in the middle of a typical Singaporean rainstorm it was a little difficult to find as th e restaurant itself was located in an outhouse of what looked like an old unused church. You have to really look around for the sign up on the main road to realize that the restaurant is located within this compound.After locating the restaurant we were quickly seated inside in a very colourful and funky space with lots of colour and artwork inside. It really is a fun place to look around and definitely not a boring space. The menu looked really interesting and although it recommended 2-3 mezze (starters) and 2-3 mains for a group of two diners we stuck to the low end of the guideline and ordered only 2 mezze and 2 mains. For starters we had the smoked anchovies and home-made hummus. Being an anchovy enthusiast I have to order these fishy treats whenever I see them on a menu but unfortunately this dish was a little boring and definitely needed something to pump it up a notch or two. The hummus was great and went very well with the flatbread which had replaced the unavailable signature pita bread.For mains we ordered a pork belly with a coffee-BBQ sauce and a dish of slow cooked lamb. Both were packed full of flavour and expertly cooked. The lamb in particular was supremely tender and fell apart with just a glance of my fork. I would recommend both dishes to other diners if they have a penchant for either pork belly or lamb.For desserts we had a peanut based dessert which I can't remember the name of but we both loved as we cannot refuse anything which has peanut butter in it. One comment which I would add is that the portions at Artichoke really are designed to share so this restaurant would really be ideal for groups of 4 or more diners. Couples can enjoy the food too but are probably advised to make sure they have a big appetite to avoid a food coma later in the evening.Service through the evening was variable. We saw other tables served by other staff being shown samples of the starters/mezze so they could see what the dishes looked like. Unfortunately our waitress did not do this and so I would hope that they can improve the consistency of the service among all staff in future.Overall a great restaurant and definitely one I would return to and recommend to others

The Chef Bjorn is an excellent and innovative cook. He creates attractive and unique dishes. The staff was very friendly and we enjoyed the outdoor seating.
5
Loved the food, the ambiance, the music and the service. This is one of the places that I would go back to every time I visit Singapore.
5
we were lucky to get a table at this popular- for good reasons- place on Middle Street. The portions are not big, but definitely tasty. The tuna is a must!
5
I am not a foodie but the food here left me wanting more. The food is amazing though the portion is pretty small in my opinion. We had the toasts, fried chicken and sticky date pudding. My friends and I love the toast, it is a really nice blend of crispy toast, creamy feta cheese and sweet pomegranate. The fried chicken is well marinated and really delicious. In addition, they really have a great atmosphere, you could just take your time and chill there. However, prices are pretty steep, but it is worth it, I will return to try other dishes

I almost never do this, but for two meals in a row, I went to Artichoke. This Mediterranean restaurant tries to be as local as possible: growing herbs in edible gardens around the restaurant and committing to a minimum amounts of local ingredients. This is especially laudable in a country that imports everything. The ambience, like their tapas style menu, is about people coming together to talk and have food....a place to share an expedience in an outdoor courtyard enclosed only by greenery. My first meal there, dinner was great. I'll admit the mushrooms lacked a coherent taste and texture from its mixed herbs, but the pawns were just perfect: they were succulent and in an amazing sauce. My only regret was not trying more things. At dinner, I took a peak at the brunch menu and proceeded to come back the next day for one of the best soft scrambles I have had. Paired with haloumi, pita that was baked that morning, and mushrooms, this dish was a rock star. I'm not a brunch person, but next time I visit, I'll be back again

My friends and I had brunch at Artichoke's a couple of months ago and I must say we had mixed feelings about the food there. The brunch food was good but the dessert we got was to say the least... strange. A couple of us ordered the sticky date pudding because it was one of our favourite desserts. However, the sticky date pudding at Artichoke's was served cold. And the strange thing was that it didn't taste like a sticky date pudding at all! It had bits of coffee flavoured jelly in it and ground peanuts. We had a couple of spoonfuls and decided we couldn't eat the rest of the dessert as it didn't taste very good at all.A bit sad as the brunch food was actually pretty tasty and the 2 of us who ordered the fried chicken really loved it

My husband, 6 month old baby and I went there for our anniversary. The brilliantly attentive and friendly staff gave us a table with enough room for the pushchair although I think the baby preferred lounging on the cushions on the bench!We chose lots of the mezze dishes and I had THE best taramasalata I'd ever tasted. The different dishes had really interesting flavour combinations and were delicious. The food was also colourful and well-presented. I think the reason the portions are a little small is so you can try other dishes or leave A LOT of room for gorgeous baklava or other desserts.We loved everything about this place - the manager was really friendly and came over to say hello and the staff were so helpful and cheerful, which was a refreshing change. The place has a cosy, quirky, laid back feel to it and we would love to come back for another special occasion some time.There are a lot of bland restaurants in Singapore with staff who don't care and expensive but bland, unoriginal food. This place is definitely not one of them
4
I went there with friends for a farewell. No doubt that the atmosphere is great and the restaurant very cozy and intimate. The food selection is ok but defo strange when you look at the menu. Flavors and ingredients are mixed in a way that looks not so appealing at first but turns out ok in the end. I loved the place but not sure I would go back as I still can't make up my mind about the food. If you eat outside, expect a few mice running around as well!
5
This place is my favourite and most visited place in Singapore over the 4 years I spent living there. The food is absolutely top quality and I never left unimpressed.Two things you must try which are amazing:1. The Shakshuka eggs2. The beetroot with labneh, dukkah and pistachioThis place is an absolute gem
5
The mezze are all delicious! Specially The humus. The gambas and its sauce were just unforgettable... The lamb was also very good! We were on an outside table with friends but we had to move se meters over the bamboo plants in order to smoke a sigarette :-( but everything was perfect anyway!
5
Ive been here 5 times. I'm so impressed with everything from the food to the service. Bjorn and his team do an outstanding job at making people happy through food. Keep it up! For me, hands down, best restaurant in SG
4
A fusion modern twist on Mediterranean dishes. Was surprised at the modern twist but it was delicious.
The best dish was the fish of the day.
Quite expensive but a nice change to the usual dips with pita.
3
Came accros this restaurant from recommendations.Had a very lovely outdoor seating and simple yet homey interior inside.We came pretty late around 2 pm while last order was at 2.45 pm. Expected that they sold out most of the menus, but apparently we only left with one option : Eggs, salad and Mushroom.Food was rather ok (No high expectation for those 3 ingredients!) But overall was dissapointed with everything sold out before the last order.Will probably come a bit earlier next time with expectation to try other menus
4
Heard so much about this place had to try it and was not disappointed at all.The mac and cheese was an absolute reinvention of the dish, grilled meat was fab.The ambience at the restaurant was eclectic to say the least and the interiors were more funk than pop.What I liked :- all the food we ordered was inspired and good.What I didn't like:- the service was alarmingly poor, they had 2 waiters taking care of like 10 tables and the desserts were very ordinary. And yes the total bill for 2 adults and 1 child was high, sgd 160 without any alcohol
5
Singapore can lack variety / creativity for brunch, so Artichoke is a massive breath of fresh air! Laban, dukha, shakshuka, & flat bread will feature extensive through the menu; & as written on the wall, NO eggs benny, burger, ketchup, pizza to be seen. Coffee was perfect, the lamb shakshuka rich & cleaned up quickly, & service attentive ... & my partners salmon pancakes well worth stealing. Recommend booking as walk-ups can sit in the sun for 40 minutes waiting for a table
5
We spent a great Saturday evening with friends at Artichoke - the owner was extremely welcoming, the setting is lovely (both inside and out) and the food was delicious. We ordered mezze, then sharing plates, then dessert and really enjoyed it all - for me, the highlights were the prawns and the cauliflower. Great food in a relaxed casual setting - not easy to find in Singapore but Artichoke get it spot on. Only downside is that they close the kitchen before 10pm. We'll definitely be back
4
Either you wait in line or you make reservation 1-2 weeks in advance! The secret for their success? It's a kool place, lokated in an artsy block (next to arts skool NAFA), serving reasonably-priced, very good Middle-Eastern-inspired dishes. The portions are gigantik. Drinks are also interesting, eg. less-known ciders, Kalimotxo (red wine and koka kola). In spite of the service labour shortage in Singapore, they have lots of staff (both in the kitchen and in the dining areas), so service is kwick and friendly. As expected for such a hip place, klientele is mainly yuppies (often with babies in tow) or gweilo; very few unkles and aunties. The stated rules are a bit quirky (eg. no ketchup/chili, no substitution, no more than 2 kredit kards per bill, etc) On the other hand, the staff is also very liberal - even at peak hours, they let you sit there without eating food, just having koffee and (free) water
5
Went here for Sunday brunch. Although it was really busy I find the setting here very relaxing. The staff are great. In a more casual way than most restaurants I've been to in Singapore. But what makes Artichokes so good for me is the wonderful and really tasty food. The servings are surprisingly large and quite reasonably priced. On most days you may have to queue for little bit to get in but it's worth it.
4
We were in a group of 13 and had a great time. The place was buzzing. The staff were attentive. We ordered basically everything off the menu and it was all delicious. Also enough variety for the vegetarian among us. All washed down with some inexpensive wine. All for less than $80 a head. They won't split a bill on credit cards, so bring cash if you want to share the cost between friends
2
We intended to sit down & have a drink at Artichoke as we find this place interesting. Was staying just at the opposite, Big Hotel. however, the waitress at the reception were so blunt that she just told us off. Though we arrived at 10.40pm and they are closed at 11pm, but they should not have just shut us off like that. The waitress could have just politely inform us that the kitchen is closed but drinks are still available or something like that. We could just use the couple of minutes for a drink or two.
4
They have varieties of cakes and drinks. Even they serve fresh milk for 2$ which is very nice when you eat with cakes.
Good service and they provide us with cold water for free!
Very recommended !
4
A very different type or restaurant for Singapore, great Mezze platter and having lived in the Middle East for 3 years their standard here is top drawer. Staff are very friendly and have a deep knowledge of their food.
5
Delicious modern middle eastern cookery in a relaxed enviroment. We ordered a selection of dishes to share and the flavours and combinations were superb.
3
Had lunch with an ex-colleague on a recent trip to Singapore. It's not exactly next to MRT station but that seems to be the only flaw. The setting is very relaxed with indoor and outdoor options. The food is all homemade with generous portions. In summary, I thought the food was just ok: my friend had the lamb whilst I had the slab of bacon
4
My nephew & niece took me to this lovely spot for brunch for my first visit to Singapore. Having studied the menu already from California I knew I was bound to have the lamb shakshuka with a side of maple bacon or should I say 'slab' of bacon. The portions were more then generous and chock full of tender lamb. The accompanying bread was a good 'vehicle' to sop up the juices. For my tastes it could have been a little spicier but I guess I could have requested some hot sauce which would have done the trick. Overall a really good brunch experience.
4
I love cafes with an attitude / sole & Artichoke has it. The food is brilliant ... we shared the daily Mezze platter & lambs Shashouka & couldn't separate which won the day. Great spot that's has a other world feel in the heart of the city. You must come here once at least !
4
Spent a few hours here having brunch for a friend's birthday last Saturday. The atmosphere was wonderful and the food was amazing. The service staff were really attentive as well. We ordered a few dishes and shared among us which was a great idea so we could taste a lot of the dishes offered. The owner was very friendly and very accommodating. Many sangrias and stuffed bellies later, we were very happy! Would definitely come here again on my next visit to Singapore!
5
I decided to try to make a reservation the day we had dinner by sending the restaurant a private message via Facebook. To my surprise, the chef (Bjorn), messaged me back and set aside a table for me. Whoa. As if that ever happens. But it did. He even came out to say hello and talk to us about food.Artichoke is the kind of place you make your place away from home. And they obviously strive for that. The manager Ronny is friendly, attentive, and helpful. The staff is obviously well-trained. The restaurant is cozy, beautifully lit, and well decorated to create comfort. We ate inside and remarked how it reminded us of some Brooklyn restaurants. The food is Mediterranean. We enjoyed the babaganoush (smoky), curry carrot tzatziki (well-spiced), and mahoumara (good kick). The bread was to DIE FOR! I had to hold myself back from just eating the bread only.We also ordered three shared plates: sauteed brocollini (scrumptuous!), braised short ribs (the star of the show), and grilled haloumi (MY FAVORITE!). The haloumi was salty as always but was dressed with a salad that complimented the saltiness. Thanks Chef Bjorn!As a nice touch, they give you a bag of gummies when you leave. Perfect! I look forward to returning to Singapore and eating at Artichoke again
5
went for a sunday brunch while visiting friends in Singapore. The options were great. We all really enjoyed the meals. The place's modern eastern cuisine provided something quite alternative to the usual brunch spots you'd find. Definitely a place i would go back to and recommend to others
4
Came for late dinner last night and the wine selection was so-so, however the duck was amazing. The vegetable platter was also satisfying. Nothing to write home about overall, but the service wasn't awful - that's saying a lot for Singapore's less than average overall standards
4
Lively restaurant with friendly and warm service. The pre-ordered lamb dish is pricey and tasty, especially the crispy bits of the outside. They serve a good selection of beers (Brewdog) and the wine is reasonable.
We will return
4
We booked ahead for Sunday brunch - it is a lovely little place, tucked away from the main road. Thought the menu selections looked great - I personally love restaurants and cafes that have a few items that are all excellent, rather than pages and pages of jumbled cuisines and dishes. We ordered the Lamb Shakshouka - which was eggs, tomato sauce, roast lamb and other yummies served in a pan (see pic). It was delish! We also ordered a grilled haloumi cheese + mushrooms and scrambled eggs. I love love haloumi so we also ordered haloumi and tomatoes as a side dish as I thought the main may not have enough slices of haloumi. Very glad I did that as I can't get enough! We also ordered a side dish of thick-cut bacon glazed in maple syrup - wow! Definitely over-ate, but it was so delicious. It was quite pricey so this is a "sometime" place rather than a place to visit often. Also, we were really distracted by a man who did not seem happy with his seating arrangements so was walking around the cafe (he would get out of his seat every few minutes) bothering the waiters, staring at every table and all the dishes, which was disconcerting. Obviously not much the staff can do, but thought they could have done more instead of trying their hardest to ignore him and everyone's uncomfortable looks
3
Came here before for dinner a year ago and it was marvellous! Sadly all has changed. The menu is short on choices and more importantly, good food. The grilled halumi and egg plant were both average. The lamb shoulder was slightly below. Service was mostly confused. Which is a pity, cos the place is beautiful and atmosphere is most charming
4
Got there at 11.15am on a Saturday. Queues already forming even though they open at 11.30. Was told I could have a table if I finished by 1pm which dampened the brunch mood. Still, the courtyard ambience was lovely and the bacon chop and scrambled eggs are excellent! I'll be sure to book ahead the next time so I won't have to choke down the first meal of the weekend. :
3
Entered restaurant via path near a church and was cheerfully greeted by the owner, who showed us to our table and explained the various dips available.The designated waiter explained that there wasn't any specials as the head chef was away. The dips and the mains were great, however we needed to prompt the waiter about drinks and a request for sweets. We found a display of sweets outside and they were delightful.Then we had to wait and wait for our bill as the waiter appeared to be distracte
2
the location is fantastic - tucked away from middle road you walk through a little courtyard and the staff is greeting you with a smile. everything looks so very peaceful and inviting. but hey, that's all the good news i have. went there for sunday brunch. i ordered a coke but actually had to order it three times to finally get it after i was done with my oily eggs, oily bread and terrible bacon. was sitting inside and that was a mistake also. - unless you like it dark and loud.will i go there again? maybe to walk through the courtyard, flash a smile at the people there and then i ll go eat somewhere with better food
4
Had breakfast here one morning and really, really enjoyed it. Cant remember exactly what we ordered, mine was a lamb stew dish with eggs and dukkah or something along those lines but the basis was lamb, sauce and eggs, my wifes was like a continental breakfast with eggs, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. On the side we ordered another serving of the mushrooms (I love mushrooms), a serve of the smoked salmon tarama (was really, really nice) and fried Haloumi which was a nice different dish to what we'd been eating in Singapore.Trendy cafe style, staff were friendly bar the manager who looked a bit stuck up this particular morning, but overall a good meal to start the morning on.Would go back if we went back to Singapor
5
My husband is Lebanese and we often seek out Middle Eastern restaurants when we travel. The food at Artichoke is some of the best that we've had. It's not strictly traditional but instead combines dishes and flavours from the Eastern Mediterranean, Gulf, and North Africa. The chef may be from Singapore but he has a deep understanding of these cuisines. It is nearly impossible to find hummus and babaganoush with the correct flavour/textures and both dishes were spot on here. Shish taouk was perfectly cooked with tasty housemade pickles that reminded my husband of home. And the atmosphere is lovely; a casual outdoor setting with a small planter garden. The manager is very friendly and clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the food. We are looking forward to visiting again the next time we are in Singapore
4
My colleagues organized a brunch at artichoke on Saturday. I must say for a hidden place on Waterloo street, there was a good crowd. This place serves moorish food so it had a very Mediterranean feel to it. The menu was limited in its selection, but the bacon chop and scrambled eggs were excellent. The mimosa was also deliciously refreshing and I also enjoyed the gelato. Service was a bit messy- very hard to get a waiter, but overall it was a nice experience
5
My wife and went here for our anniversary dinner and the staff were really nice and made us feel like it was a celebration. The manager came and always checked that everything was perfect. My wife is gluten free so they brought out a menu which the chef had ticked everything which she could select from which was a lot of the menu. The food is exceptional! I had a shared tapas as our starter with my wife, then we had slow roasted lamb shoulder which was melt in your mouth with sides of stewed spiced veggies. Both exceptionally tasty. Our food was preceded by a gifted complimentary glass of champagne each which was nice as we said we were on a budget. Our meal with a bottle of wine, entree, main and deserts cost SGD188. Pretty good considering it was an excellent 3 coursed meal with wine in Singapore.The restaurant is not pretentious and food is great. It is nicely hidden away in the back corner of the Sculpture Square corner. The area is split up into areas and corners so groups could operate well without interfering with couples. The food has a middle eastern focus but is not overwhelming. Thank you to the staff and the chef for a excellent night out. The fact that they were allergy aware made the night particularly good for piece of mind for myself and my wife
4
This place is not easy to find from the street but once here very cosy ad great atmosphere. Lovely setting, lovely food - will be back again.
5
So here is a restaurant with a real passion for food. Unique but familular dishes. Great textures and flavours. Good size portions. Just a really nice dining experience.
4
This is one of those places you wouldn't expect to find tucked away in the city. A quaint courtyard with plants and herbs is the al fresco section. The atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. Tapas were great, particularly the hummus with smoked paprika served with crisp ciabatta. I ordered the scallops paired unexpectedly with cauliflower and pomegranate, which was yummy. Hubby ordered the lamb (signature dish), loved it
5
I was craving for a middle eastern cuisine and thought about trying this resto near Bugis. Its like a hidden gem tucked in a quiet area at Sculpture square. Artichoke has that cozy atmosphere and chillout vibe that's great for a relaxing dinner with friends or partner. I went with a friend and we both enjoyed our food. We ordered hummus & labneh (w/their oh so good bread), organic mushroom, spinach garlic in truffle oil, black angus ribeye steak and date pudding for our dessert. The food are simply plated and presented yet the taste of each food is rich and delicious. Their food is meant for sharing as they promote communal dining. I would recommend this place for other foodie who once in a while want to spend a bit for a great meal. Its quite funny just below the total bill amount states "the damage". A clear indication of the pending damage to your wallet. But its all worth it. The staff service are okay, they're friendly and attentive to our needs
4
Hurray - new chef. Seriously better than 6 months ago. We couldn't get into our most favourite restaurants so with intrepidation we thought we would try again.So pleased we did. Thank god the ridiculous macaroni cheese is off the menu. Best dishes: scallops. Pulled duck. Green salad (very ottalingi) and the usual mezze dips. At our table of 6 we ordered almost all the menu items and were pleased - and let me tell you in this town getting a decent meal where you can say 'that was great and be honest about it' is rare. The only trouble you will be kicked out (nicely) by 11.30.Wine is mid tier $70 bottle. And staff who know what they are talking about and like what they do! Another rare experience.Good work will be back Tuesday night for the chefs choice menu.
5
This is a very warm friendly place with a great vibe..The Chef and staff are super friendly and accommodating. We sat in the courtyard which was very pleasant and you can see all the vegetables and herbs they are growing for use in the restaurant. We tried all the mezze dishes which were excellent and then we ordered some lamb dishes based on the staff's recommendations. I have to say this was some of the best lamb I have ever tried just delicious. And you have to have some pastries they are incredible. The pastry chef is very talented and I had some of the amazing baklava, I would go back just for the pastries !!!! Great place of a date, group of friends, pretty much any scenario..I'll be back !!!
4
Came for dinner on a Tuesday night with friends. The menu was limited compared to the Wed-Sat menu, however the Chef's set menu was really good and very good value. The food is what I call real good honest food. Its a mix of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern with a focus on share plates/dishes. The setting is casual and cool. The staff are very attentive and helpful. They allow BYO for $25/btl which is great if you have a favourite wine you would like to enjoy with friends for dinner. I will definitely come back again. I would recommend Wed-Sat night for dinner because the menu is more extensive
4
Not quite sure what to make of this place. A restaurant that advertises itself as quasi-Middle eastern but the weakest dish I felt was the mezze, which would be a staple of any true Lebanese restaurant, and there is plenty of pork on the menu. A brunch spot with a slightly obnoxious sign telling you not to attempt to order eggs Benedict, and the coffee takes forever to arrive. When making a reservation I was quite arrogantly told they would hold it for only 15 minutes, but it wasn't full when I went. Having said that, that's probably the worst aspects of my review. The positives, the scrambled eggs with maple bacon (yes, the pork) was excellent. They put some crispy stuff in the scramble and the "Mediterranean" (I can't say "middle-eastern" or Lebanese with a straight face) aspect of it was covered by some chickpeas. The baklava were all very fresh and tasty (if you don't like yours too sweet, order the pistachio or cashewnut varieties). The coffee, when it did arrive, was very good. By Singapore standards prices were reasonable. Not a bad option in a rapidly developing part of town, but if hankering for authentic Lebanese, you'll be disappointed
4
Went here with a few friends on a weekend, overall had a good time!The mixed platter was a nice assortment of Mediterranean dishes and came with some bread. Each of the small items were well done, here you are paying for the assortment and not so much the quantity, for $50 (double-size platter), I didn't find it to be very good value.Scrambled Eggs with Maple Glazed Bacon Chop - this was very good and very tasty. A nice blend of flavours and the bacon chop was a great cut of thick bacon (think 1-2cm thick). I recommend ordering this.Lamb Shakshouka - Excellent (and heavy) dish. The lamb, tomatoes, eggs, etc. make this a heavy dish but delicious in every bite. Again, ingredients are all well prepared and of high quality.Date Pudding - Great dessert, highly recommended.Service - Good, nothing amazing, nothing bad. The staff were pleasant and did their jobs well.Overall, the food here was very good, it did taste ‘different’ due to the Mediterranean influence so didn’t feel like typical brunch food, but was good food regardless (just don’t go expecting your usual eggs benedict). Artichoke makes this list for recommended brunch spots in Singapore
4
Artichoke is a real little gem, not easily visible from the street, it is quaintly decorated, clean and comfortable. Their style is to see what is available at the market then adjust/design the menu accordingly. Our food arrived quickly and very well prepared. Fresh pickle garnishes are made on site, desserts are made in their attached bakery. The owner moves from table to table chatting comfortably with his customers, taking orders and ensuring everyone is satisfied. It seems to be a popular place, so isn't quiet, tables were filled with people talking and laughing. A really great place to enjoy brunch, lunch or dinner
4
Interesting concept of serving food tapas-style (but selection is not just the usual tapas fare). Highly recommend the chicken, cheese, pork and beet root. Although the outdoor seating is very charming, can get hot and stuffy given Singapore's climate.
5
We came to Artichoke without a reservation (I would recommend one as we got lucky with a bar spot) and had a lovely experience. Had their set brunch which was an interesting spread of Med/Leb samplings. Bit pricey though.
5
Very nice and rustic place hidden behind a church - away from the busy road and thus a bit quieter. :) The terrace is very nicely decorated, mediterranean food is inventive and tasty - plates are a tiny bit too copious though. Service is attentive and fast. Would definitely bring friends and recommend it to anyone for a week-end brunch!
5
Artichoke was probably my Fave new restaurant of this trip to Singapore; very creative ambience (old church set in the energetic and colorful Bugis area), delicious food and very attentive service (from both the owner and the friendly and attentive servers- i can't say enough about the service since my experience in other restaurants was absolutely disappointing)The owner was so on top of things- spotted my parents with us and knew exactly how to approach the challenge, made awesome recommendations and came back over and over again to check on us. The waitstaff was smart and friendly- very well-trained servers. The food was delicious, from the Meze Platter to the Lamb Shiska (sp) and my sis's Haloumi cheese salad. The date pudding was delicious too. Prices are very reasonable; brunch is only served on the weekends. We'll be back to check out dinner service! Be sure to make reservationsHighly, highly recommen
2
We waited 40 mins until the first dish will be prepared. During that time we ate bread and even lost appetite. The restaurant was not packed, just a usual evening on Sat. when we ordered beer, they forgot to bring it so we had to remind. And I was with guests which I invited. Plus the prices are very expensive for a small portion. Definitely never go there again
4
Myself and my girlfriend recently had dinner at Art-i-choke and I was very impressed with the quality of the tapas dishes. It was my girlfriend's second time eating there and I now know why she brought me. There is both indoor and outdoor seating areas and there was a great buzz and atmosphere in the restaurant. We started with reasonably priced starters and the main courses were very generous. The quality of the food is excellent and I would recommend Art-i-Choke to anyone looking for a relaxed tapas meal. P.S. Go for the Chocolate Cookie Desert!
5
Artichoke is a highly recommended eatery near Bras Basah MRT. The concept is very similar to one that I have been working on for some time and hopefully will materialize in the not too distant future. A compact menu of ‘eastern Mediterranean’ dishes cater for all tastes and offer that all too missing option – vegetarian – and is fantastic...but. 4 meze, a veg dish and a lamb main were shared between my partner and I and were all outstanding. The great food was complimented by a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. The restaurant offers inside and outside seating options. Inside not conducive to a quite romantic dinner, not because of the all to frequent conversation drowning loud music found in so many restaurants, but because of the sounds of laughter and dinner chat shared by happy diners.So a great atmosphere, a selection of fantastic dishes, friendly (and knowledgeable) staff and very reasonable prices make this a must visit (and revisit) eatery, but...Do NOT be tempted by the limited dessert menu. What promised to be a ‘firework’ ending could have ruined the dinner. The two desserts we tried were over complicate and, the flavours did not work together - at all. That said the sauce with my date pudding was (almost) worth going through the disappointment of the rest of the dessert.So, go, Go, GO and have a delicious meal in relaxed surroundings – but avoid the dessert!. It’s well worth making the effort for
5
My friend is a regular at Artichoke and suggested we go there for Sunday brunch. We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed but they found room for us quickly. I ordered the lemon cornbread and my friend ordered the haloumi I &mushrooms. Both dishes were equally delicious. The portions were a good size leaving you pleasantly full. Service was attentive and quick. I had such a great experience at brunch I'm definitely going back for dinner. If you are looking for an innovative brunch with fresh ingredients and exciting flavors, Artichoke is the place for you. It's my new favorite restaurant in Singapore
4
We had dinner here on Friday evening the 8th of September, with a group of six. All in all quite a pleasant experience. The food is of excellent quality, there's a nice selection of wine and beer (try the Pale Ale from Western Australia, really gooed well with the food)... but most of all: the restaurant itself has a rather pleasant, relaxed vibe to it. We had some mezzes to share, as well as some larger dishes such as the tuna one (raw tuna, salad like), chicken and beef. All of excellent quality. We finished with the dade pudding. Definitely a place to come back to
3
We decided we wanted a small brunch and Jodie found Artichoke on the web. The address was clear and we found the place easily. They told us we didn't need a booking but when we arrived they asked if we had one and since we didn't the only places available were in the courtyard outside. This was not an issue but it would have been nice to know we had options if we made a booking.It's a simple brunch menu with few choices accompanied by a wider variety of drink choices. My wife and I both chose the haloumi with mushrooms and we ordered scrambled eggs and bacon for our son. Food and drinks arrived fairly quickly, presentation was adequate and the service was friendly.Artichoke is too expensive for the quality of the food it serves. I would have been very happy had the price been 25-35% lower. I suspect the prices are higher and food quality lower since it's close to a number of tourist spots. I won't be rushing back for bunch. We might try dinner but with the variety of choices available in Singapore there are other places where the quality of food provided is better for the prices that Artichoke charges
4
Excellent selection of foods. Reasonable alcohol selection. Very good ambience.

Our friends told us about this place a few weeks ago, and we've now been twice for dinner and twice for brunch. Having lived in Dubai, I've long been a fan of mezze-style eating, and there are very few places in Singapore that offer semi-authentic Arabic (or in this case 'Moorish') dips and starters. We always choose the '4 for $25' to start, and love these.Main courses have been a bit mixed - the last time we had dinner the Lamb shoulder in couscous broth was a bit mean and gristly, whereas the week before it was awesome (although the menu changed so it was a different dish). The Grilled Chicken shish tawoook has always been fantastic.Brunch can be a bit hit and miss - the Lamb Shakshouka has wonderful flavours, but is essentially an egg dish with very little lamb in it. However, the haloumi and mushrooms, and the scrambled egg and sausage dishes are hearty and delicious.I prefer the inside seating, as the outside is fairly bland plus there's the very real possibility of being savaged by mosquitos. Service, as noted in many reviews here, can be endearing, authentic, and comical at the same time - all the staff are sweet and well intentioned, but some lack basic skills and having to remind waiters to bring things they've forgotten is always a pain. Having said that, Ronnie the manager is a diamond - he loves his place and it's plain to see. Couple that with generally good - and sometimes great - food, and a reasonable $25 for corkage, and you've got a winner
5
Singapore is possibly the best place to be on the planet if you are a foodie and for me this place was a total find. I came here with a friend for brunch and it was lively, cheerful and the food was melt in the mout good. Try the eggs. They're excellent. I would love to come back here for dinner and try their Middle Eastern style menu.
3
Having spent quite a bit of time in the Middle East, I've struggled with finding good authentic Arabic food in Singapore. Most of the food is 'spiced' to the local palate. Artichoke, however, tries to do things differently. Set in a beautiful sculpture garden that somehow shields you from the noise of the bustling Bugis area, the ambience is excellent (although I hope they end their annoying policy of saying 'we're fully booked but ask us' when the place is half empty).The food however is the real reason you come. It's basically fresh, authentic mezze (excellent babaganoush, hummus and muhammra) coupled with some amusing fusion touches - the pork dishes sitting on the menu though makes me think this place isn't halal :-)The only problem is the price. Singapore has a problem with pricing its mid-range restaurants and my only gripe was that for a casual restaurant a few mezze dishes and one main (shared) plus a coke set us back more than S$80 (GBP40).

In the evocatively named "sculpture square" is nestled this little rough-hewn semigem of a restaurant. I went on a weekday night. The design is scrubbed-down industrial chic (mismatched chairs, blackboard wall with du jours scribbled in white chalk, bare floors etc). The food ranged from very good (shish taouk, beetroot) to not-that-special (quail kebab, crab pate) but was never less than fresh.The wait staff, however, knew next-to-nothing about the wines (I attribute this to poor (or no) training on the management's part rather than any particular fault of the waiters themselves), more jarring was the fact that we were served by three different waiters throughout the evening despite a half-empty restaurant. Truly competent wait staff are such a rarity in Singapore, though, that one can hardly hold this against the restaurant.There was also some perplexing switching of menus (we were apparently given the wrong ones initially), and despite a "special" being ominously erased from the blackboard we discovered it in the (new) menu, and were able to place an order. Why erase it then? Or why highlight it in the first place?I guess it was a quiet weekday night - which made for good conversation with my dining partner - but noticeably absent was the "buzz" and enveloping conviviality of a truly good middle eastern restaurant. There were enough things going for it, though (food, location) that I'd probably give it another chance (on a busier weekend night) to work its charm, should that exist.

I have been to Artichoke for drinks several times, but decided to check it out for dinner with some friends recently. Even though I've read bad reviews about their service, I had a pretty good experience. I got there early so I was seated at my table first, and immediately was given the food and drinks menus. I asked for a recommendation and eventually settled on a glass of Prima (Tempranillo blend), which was pretty good. I was served a bottle of water without even asking for it.When my friends arrived, we decided to shift tables and sit outside instead, and the staff were very helpful in helping us move to a table outdoors. Once settled, we decided to order our food. The thing I like about Artichoke is that their food is meant to be shared. So we ordered their dips, comes in a set of three dips with some pita bread. The dips are really good - one was hummus (made from chickpeas), the second was a cheese-yoghurt based dip, and the last was a red peppers based one. The red peppers dip was my favourite and I daresay, the favourite of my friends too.We also ordered the crab pate, which was interesting and tasted quite nice, but I wasn't blown away or anything. The tuna tartare was really nice, I recommend trying it. And we also ordered the beetroot salad, which was really nice, but I hate beetroot and the taste of the beetroot was just too overpowering for my liking. My friends swear by it though. And that's summed up the appetisers.Then we ordered the pork ribs and the shish taouk (7-spiced chicken) for mains, which we shared. I liked them both a lot. The pork, to me, was good, but didn't particularly stand out from the norm. The chicken however, I really liked. It came with a yoghurt based dip, which just added to the subtle flavour of the spices.Quite a lot of food for three people, but it was all so tasty that we devoured it all!Then for dessert, we ordered the date pudding and the dark chocolate brownie. The chocolate brownie was non-descipt, even though it was supposed to be a hazelnut chocolate brownie, it tasted very normal to me. The date pudding on the other hand, was not your conventional date pudding at all. It is cakey in texture, and instead of the standard butterscotch sauce, it comes with smoked milk custard and salted caramel. Yumm!! The only complain I have is that the desserts came out within 3 minutes of us ordering them, which means they obviously weren't made fresh. Which most places don't do, that's understandable. But it wasn't even warm! On hindsight, I should have sent them back and asked for them to be warmed up properly, then they would've tasted even better!When I was leaving Artichoke, the staff passed me a little brown paper bag as a leaving gift, which I thought was a nice gesture. It had a few pieces of gummies in it. Nice thought.On the whole, I'd definitely go back to Artichoke again. The food is excellent and the vibe is really unconventional. I've heard their brunch is pretty good, so I think I'll go back to try that someday

My wife organized a brunch with some friends and she came up with this small bar/restaurant in a small low-ricer. The location is great and it is so fine. You can site outside be embedded into short older buildings and 30 meters way the city shows its calibers of monuments.The cuisine is somewhat fusion with a focus on Mediterranean dishes from North-Africa, Greece and even Spanish. The portions are fine and the prices okay. The breakfast is great with toasted black-bread. Try it!!

We joined friends (8 of us) at artichoke for dinner a couple of weeks ago. A somewhat buzzy restaurant with an informal atmosphere. Tables very rustic, service from being seated was sporadic with meals arriving randomly with little thought for who ordered them or whether they were entrees or main courses. The food was interesting and extremely tasty. Deserts arrived before main dishes were cleared and as they were we were told we had to be out by 11 as they worked the next day. No sooner had the desert spoon hit the plate for the final time and we were asked to leave as they had to set up. Very disappointing and a shame as the food is good - does not bode well for medium term survival in a competitive market

We decided to have a Sunday brunch at Artichoke after hearing a favourable review from a friend. When we arrived, the maitre d seemed unhappy that we had not made a reservation and told us we would have to wait. We decided to wait, and I requested we review a menu in the meantime. He passed us the menus but was unfriendly thru the whole discussion, not cracking a smile once! Even though we had only asked once for the table at the start, the maitre d repeatedly told us we would have to wait until it was cleared, it felt like he thought we had been asking repeatedly for the table. The menu is limited but adequate, but I was surprised that they stated if special requests /substitutions were made an extra $2 surcharge would apply. When my friend asked for tomato sauce to go with her eggs, she was told they would charge an extra 50c. Overall the food was fine, the waitresses were ok, but considering this is a relatively pricey cafe, the extra surcharges etc seem somewhat penny pinching. I am not sure I would be keen to return due to the poor attitude we encountered ther

No doubt you'll find something to like here. For a start, it's a little bit like a "secret restaurant". Not that it's undiscovered, just that it's on a quiet end of Waterloo Street hidden from view behind the lovely old buildings of sculpture square. The alfresco courtyard you walk through to get to the entrance is casual-chic, and so is the staff, who don't seem to carry around any of the pretentiousness of some hip restaurants, cafÃ©s and bars in Singapore.The menu is small, but packed with goodies, and if you're veggie then you'll have a fine time because there's no shortage of choices for you. There's meat too, and as you'd expect from modern middle eastern, the emphasis is on lamb with not much fish in sight.The way to eat here is to share, and 4 dishes and some bread is probably about right for 2 people. For us, not all dishes were winners. The lamb ribs (in a Coca Cola marinade) and the grain salad were both divine and I'd order them both again. The chicken dish was overwhelming and the broccoli dish was underwhelming. All were generously proportioned though, except (strangely) the bread which was a small and unexciting combo of Turkish and crisp.Because the dishes that were good were so very good, and we had something to go on to nearby at the Singapore Art Museum afterwards, we thought it was an excellent dining experience and we totally forgave the dishes we didn't think were so great. It's homey and comfortable and if you wanted to hang out with drinks it'd be a nice spot for it. They have a small but nicely curated drinks list, and while we were there they were setting up for some live music in the courtyard. It has some nice touches of service you find in other cities, like Melbourne, that Singapore restaurants so often don't get right. When you order water they leave you with a bottle, cold and free from the tap, so there's none of that going through the "still or sparkling" rigmarole. With the bill we got little brown paper bags of gummy sweets. The staff seemed genuinely happy to be working there, not like they'd been out back sucking lemons.All up, it's got a great vibe, and I think if you choose your dishes well then also great food. There's certainly love in it.And, it's incredibly reasonably priced, with dishes ranging from around $15 to $30. You'll be in and out of here for less than $50 per head (plus drinks).It seems to exist outside of what's hip and cool this month, and I got the feeling that the kitchen and front-of-house were just trying to run a really great restaurant with good food and service. Probably the type of restaurant that they themselves like to go to. Because it's genuine and from the heart, it succeeds in spades
