Had a nice meal at Goldleaf Restaurant. The interior is a little basic, but the food and service was very good. Only downside was that the beer came in a can.

Tradition Taiwan food. Love it.
Price is reasonable but portion is quite small for family of four.
Parking is not a problem here.

Lovely traditional dishes with Taiwanese porridge. Tasty combinations with helpful & friendly staff. Beautiful historical location of Katong Police station building. Check out those signature dishes in the photos!

A reasonable meal but a little pricey. Very quiet - only one other table of diners when we visited. Meals came out very quickly.

Had dinner there. Hardly 3 tables only and have serious doubt over the freshness of their food.
Service is very good.
Ambience is ok.

Goldleaf restaurant serves a wide variety of chinese cuisine. I was exceptionally impressed with its signature cod fish, crispy skin and soft meat drenched in a special sweet sauce. Even the starter dish, braised beancurd, is delectable by itself or with porridge!

Tried this place one evening near where we live. Great location in the middle of East Coast Road. Ambience a bit disappointing. Very bare inside with very little decoration, just a bunch of tables in a room.Have travelled to Taiwan frequently and found the food to be quite authentic. The stir fried Taiwan lettuce for example was quite good. Quite a lot of choice on the menu.Prices were reasonable, and staff were ok.All in all though, better options along East Coast Road for dinner

Lunch with my classmates with early Loh Hei. The sweet potato porridge and some of the dishes reminded us of old times.Chye Poh omelette, braised pork belly, 3-cup chicken with basil and pork ribs. It was simply delicious. It has good ambient and the staff were courteous. IT was a memorable gathering for us

A wonderful dinner with delectable spread of signature favorites including Taiwanese lettuce, cod fish, fried prawn rolls and uniquely Goldleaf Volcano Beancurd. Choice selection of quality fresh ingredients, truly a warm corner for meals with homemade touch, would definitely return to try the rest of their unique dishes! Better still, they have great service, informative of their offerings and menu, topped off with opening hours till late, perfect for accommodating uninterrupted conversations. Ambience was ideal for a nice catchup with friends - Taiwanese tunes to familiar favourites laced the background music, with great seating capacities and layout. Quaint cosy corner well situated in the midst of the Katong food jungle, Goldleaf is definitely worth the visit
