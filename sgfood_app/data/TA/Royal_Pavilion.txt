Visited today with a friend and simply delighted by the service and food that we received. Special mention to truffle cake: totally worth being there. And staff were polite and responsive. Specially Mr Roger.
Overall thumbs up.

Always enjoy my meal here. Refined Cantonese cuisine without burning a hole in the pocket. Excellent service staff too which is rare nowadays. They have an a la carte buffet this month. Folks obviously don't know about this place coz it's never crowded.

Lovely appointed restaurant with attentive friendly staff located in the Park Regis, Singapore. Very good menu and reasonably priced. I am not an expert on Cantonese cuisine but the meals we had were absolutely delicious and bursting with flavour. Recommend.

Tucked away in a cozy hotel in Merchant Road is a fabulous Dim Sum restaurant in Park Regis. This is the Royal Pavilion which is a must try. I was invited for a business lunch and was pleasantly surprised by this bustling Chinese restaurant in a boutique hotel. The Cheong fun was smooth and silky. The special XO fried carrot cake cannot be missed. Although not a fan of porridge I must say the pai dan choke was excellent. The wait staff asked me to try the chicken pie. My party was mystified. Such a strange dim sum choice. But we rallied around and ordered the truffle chicken pie to try. We ended up ordering a dozen to go. It was simply delicious with fluffy light pastry and incredible truffle filling with the chicken pie. And the dessert menu was really extensive. I am not a red bean fan but I have to say that the pan fried Chinese pancake is a must try. A must try.

We went to this hotel restaurant for dinner and noticed that we were the only customers at 8pm on a Thursday night. Nonetheless we were looking forward to some good food but when we saw a whole page of the menu devoted to shark fin dishes we decided we had to withdraw. I'm sure that most Chinese restaurants in Singapore serve shark's fin but we felt we could not contribute in any way to the horrendous practice of shark mutilation to produce these dishes

I bought the dinner buffet vouchers .The food tasted like left overs from yesterday.Service was poor. cheap ingredients were used .You will be charged if you could not finish the food on your plate. I was questioned by the waiter why I did not eat the lobster's head. By the way, the lobster was tiny. Do I really have to finsh off the lobster's eyes, brains , and gills ? We were also charged for napkins $ 2 eac

This restaurant serves one of the finest Cantonese cuisine in town. They have some very well crafted innovative dishes that provide a refreshing balance to the classic ones. The dim sums were made when order which tasted fresh and flavor was distinct. The more elaborate dishes like abalone were masterfully done to perfection. Dishes were always served steaming or sizzling hot as they were served immediately after cooked. Food presentation was nice and complemented with matching cutlery. I believe the food here can satisfy the most demanding connoisseur.Staff was passionate and knowledgeable about their food. Service was acceptable. Staff were friendly but a little too intrusive. Some training on service etiquette will help.Ambient is classy and comfortable. Suitable for both business and casual dinning. The restaurant is located in the Park Regis Hotel which provide plenty of parking. Despite the very fine food quality, the price point is at mid-range. Highly recommended

In Summary:It is one of the classier Chinese restaurants that I will recommend without hesitation.For the price you pay, you do enjoy good food and service in a lovely environment.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:This is my first visit to the restaurant and I have heard good reviews from those who have dined here before. I will definitely revisit this restaurant in the near future.1. Service – 5 out of 5My family was given the middle covered portion of the restaurant and they made the extra effort to ensure privacy while dining in comfort. The service crew was attentive without being obtrusive and all the dishes were served at a comfortable pace.2. Ambience – 5 out of 5Bright, well-spaced and modern, this is one of the better decorated Chinese restaurants that I have visited. I do like the slight Western twist, as seen from the chandeliers, in the décor, giving the restaurant a trendy vibe.3. Cleanliness – 5 out of 5The table cloth seems really white and the cutlery is sparking clean, if that is your kind of thing.4. Taste – 5 out of 5We each ordered the five course lunch set meal. We did not choose the most expensive set meal as we preferred to order some of their recommended dishes on top of the set lunch. The starters proved to be a tease with the tangy soaked tomatoes and spicy shrimp chilli bursting full of flavours. The dim sum soon arrived and we were greeted by the waitress who explained the sequence of how we should eat the dim sum, with regards to their taste, to ensure the maximum taste of the set’s first dish. Flavours were well balanced and the first dish ended well with the char siew pastry which was my personal favourite with its crisp outside and well marinated pork within. The winter melon soup was served shortly and the flavours were further enhanced by the taste of dried scallop that were used. The meal continued with shark’s fin, which we ordered separately, and the broth was thick and flavourful without being overwhelming. The smoked duck, which we ordered separately as well, came soon after. The meat was well smoked and the skin was crispy without being excessively oily. Cod was served next and while the sauce was refreshing, the dish tasted rather tame compared to the other dishes which were bursting in flavours. We ended off with, strangely, fried prawn noodles which was extremely filling, and most of us did not finish this dish though it was fried well. The desserts came after our tables were cleared and served as both a thirst quencher and a sweet ending for a meal well enjoyed.5. Value for Money - 5 out of 5For a table of five, we spent about $300, which is reasonable, given that we each had a five course set lunch and a few a la carte dishes. What really impresses me most was the elegant yet non-pretentious way the food was done and served at such a price. It is a restaurant that I will crave for till my next visit
