Had their Valentine's Day set menu and it was excellent. Every dish was so interesting and unique. My partner described it as the best dinner she ever had. Ambience was good too as was the service - efficient, attentive yet not intrusive
3
Each course was lovingly plated, visually very appetizing. The weakness was in the experience itself. Macaron was served cold hence it was almost impossible to chew through the frozen caramel, foie gras pate. Taste was a little overwhelming. Main course was the tooth fish or the pork- both creamy and/or fatty hence it was difficult for us to end with the tiramisu. Grilled squid was good, but I found the ‘squid bone’ in mine. Slightly disappointing for such detailed presentation. Lobster pasta was the highlight of the day
5
I booked a Friday evening dinner in the private room for 9 colleagues including our company president. We ordered the Italian/Japanese degustation menu each and opened 3 bottles of wine in total. The private room was very cosy and the view on the 24th floor looking down Orchard Road was fantastic. We had pre-selected our menu selection one week in advance as advised by the restaurant manager so service was prompt. Both the Italian and Japanese menus were excellent. My colleagues commented on the exquisite presentation and unique taste of each course. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience. Highly recommended for corporate dinners. Do note that the private room can comfortably seat 10 people only.
5
Overall excellent, quite place, great for families, nice views, excellent menu choices. On the pricey side. Will definitely visit again.
5
Have booked the restaurant for my Husband birthday celebration. The staff service was good and attentive. The food was delicious and presentable. Worth the trip and we will be back again to try other dishes
4
Food is good size, n taste is ok.Not cold A/C, quite place.I definitely will come back soon.Thank u
5
Food was great artistic way. Ofcourse lobster couldnt go wrong. But in overall unique taste. Oh i loved uni sauc
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday there. Staff was attentive and the food was nice. Was especially impressed by the Sea Urchin Spaghetti and the Yuzu Sphere Lemon Sorbet as dessert. Grateful that the restaurant was able to accommodate us, despite having a 6 month old baby with us
4
Gourmet Japanese-Italian cuisine, in a cosy, small restaurant by the hotel poolside. Very nice views over Orchard Road area, matched by interesting cuisine. We enjoyed the pasta especially the vongole, and all the starters. Choices of main courses were rather limited. As was the wine.. Service was efficient, but rather cursory and not warm or friendly.
5
Went for lunch on my wife recommendation.We had buffalo mozzarella with Parma ham and beef tartar for starters: generous portions well balanced and authentic taste.Being my companion intolerant to garlic, we asked for the linguine aglio & olio with sea urchin without .... garlic (!!!). The waiter and the chef did not beat an eyelid and pronto the pasta came as ordered. It was magnificent and sumptuous ! Compliment to the kitchen ! An experience to be repeated over and over 
3
Overall was ok. The starters was not bad but the main course was not so good and it was quite expensive. Not worth the price. The atmosphere was ok.
5
Visited Il Cielo during a weekday and had the set lunch. Extremely value for money at 2 courses for $25++ and 3 for $35++. I had the Buffalo Mozzarella Salad and Squid Ink Tagliolini al Pesto. Generous servings and the food was nothing short of excellent. The texture of the pasta was delicate and distinctive of fresh handmade pastas, while the de-shelled clams were plum and fresh. Also, interesting use of semi-dried datterini tomatoes to provide a acidic taste in contrast to the earthy pesto sauce. You don't taste the usual sweetness that this variety of tomatoes are known for, yet most of the juiciness is retained and the flavour is a lot less intense than commonly dried ones. The Japanese Chef's take on Italian cuisine is quite unique and certainly worth a try if you are looking for some exciting flavours. Service from the team was extremely prompt and professional. Many thanks to the friendly restaurant manager, Edza, for going the extra mile to interact with me, answer my questions with great patience and for explaining each course in detail. That is excellent service worth returning for!Sad to say, the setting of the restaurant does pale comparison to others I've been to. The dining room is quite small so it's probably more suitable for intimate gatherings or business lunches for smaller groups. And although it is situated next to the pool, there wasn't any view in the afternoon as the shades were down. But ambience aside, my experience at Il Cielo was amazing and I'll already planning my next visit to try other dishes on the menu
5
Set lunch was very good for value. Food was amazing and presention was out of this world. Servers were attentive and friendly
5
Fantastic food and excellent service. Would definitely come back again. Recommend the pasta with fungi and shaved truffl
5
Very good value for weekday lunch set also food is nice. Plus bonus is that the menu is changed every week so I am happy to go there very often. Didnâ€™t try its dessert this time as felt full after having 2 courses. Definitely will try it next time.
5
We love Cielo because it is a combination of great Italian food and a great setting. Because it is the roof pool bar and restaurant of the Orchard Road Hilton, it is one of the few places in Singapore where you can have a bit of a breeze in the evening. The view is stunning, the place is calm and quiet and there are no bugs, all because you are high up on the 33rd floor. Service is great. They have a good selection of wines and a nice set of Italian dishes. You can also just get a pizza and salad. Still, the setting is one of a classy restaurant, ideal for business but also very romantic for couples.
4
A good restaurant that i would definitely visit again. THe food was well prepared delicious and the service was attentive, Well done
5
High culinary standards of Italian flavours infused with Japanese flair.A perfect oasis to chill out by the poolside while taking in the city's magnificent sunset views
4
Being tried two-course set lunch at affordable price. The lunch are excellent and highly recommend to all. Not suitable for romantic dating as it was quite noisy due to the restaurant is quite small and you can hear everyone talking around.
5
Booked this place on a whim after seeing an offer for a complimentary wine flight with 5 course degustation.I love it when expectations are exceeded, and in this case they were! The service was warm and efficient, the rooftop setting by the pool was refreshing, and the decadently presented food was delicious! With only a small number of tables in an intimate setting I'd highly recommend Il Cielo for a romantic dinner date.
4
Had the lunch set (35++ for 3 courses). Great ambience! Dishes were presented well with good service, though the portions was on the smaller side. Still an enjoyable afternoon, and we could also spend some time at the poolside lounge area which was lovely.
5
Ambience and food was good! The waitresses did their best to serve us despite a busy Saturday! Thumbs up!
4
Nice atmosphere at the restaurant beside the pool. Accompanied by music from a singer. Food was decent.
4
This Italian restaurant in the Hilton Hotel has a lunch set menu which is a good value for money. The food here is quite tasty.
5
Celebrated my Girlfriend's Birthday there on a Sunday Night. Romantic ambience, excellent staff and great service.
4
Love the service and food taste great. only thing is that the main portion could be slightly more. view was nice.
2
There were three of us. Two of us picked the fish and the other foie gras. One of the fish was bad but my friend didn't want to complain or raise an issue. It was embarassing as I told them about the good the write ups that I had read before coming. She didn't touch the fish. Got to watch what they are serving
3
My husband and I (along with a friend) came here last month for their Happy Hour (drinks and appetizers) and really enjoyed our time there. We sat at the bar which is just outside this restaurant on the roof of the Hilton (an amazing view at night!). The happy hour menu is very reasonable for Singapore...$7 SGD for drinks, with various tapas plates for $7-12. Their Happy Hour is 6-10pm every day (not really "happy hour time", but it worked out well to watch the sunset from the bar). My friend and I enjoyed the spritz (cocktail made from champagne). Tapas were a little bland (I'm really glad I didn't pay for a full meal at the restaurant). I would highly recommend this place for the view, cheap drinks and the atmosphere (live music on Thurs-Saturdays). I will definitely come here again for drinks when I'm in Singapore
3
There are three reasons that make this Italian restaurant worthy of a visit. First, it is perched on the 24F of the Hilton along ORchard Road, with a view of the gleaming swimming pools and the clear Singapore skies. Second, there was a Citibank card promo 3-for-2 on the lunch sets until 30 April 2016. Third, service is well-trained and attentive without being fussy. Furthermore, we found the interiors tasteful and unpretentious. Unfortunately, I think that the chef can do better and be more creative about the menu selections. IN addition, the wines are a bit pricey.We may return for cocktails on a Thursday evening as beer, peroni and selected wines are offered at 7SGD++ (between 6-10pm), and when there is live music 8-9:15pm..
4
The salad and mains are very well prepared and they have great taste.The deserts are superlative. The restaurant is rather tight on space due to many levels. I think a renovation should be done to bring it to one level, have a long stretch area near the pool and close the entire pool view from the restaurant leaving only a natural light area
4
Great food with some exceptional flavours. A bit on the pricey side but not many places in Singapore aren't. The view of the city is spectaular, and the staff is very helpful and attentive.
4
Restaurant feels a little old but food was good, particulary the Tuscan seafood starter and roasted Calamari
4
This place has 2 great things:
- the quality of the food
- the view (24th floor of Hilton hotel)
The price may be a bit higher than the average but it worth it.
You can also enjoy some great live music during dinner.
5
Roof top at 24th floor . Great Ambience . Yummy food. Efficient and attentive staffs.Edza ,Shine and team will give you a memorable trip to Il Cielo.Set lunch is super great deal. Go try.I enjoyed totally for lunch date and dinner date too
4
We were full and didn't order too much for dinner (2 pastas, 1 veg and 2 drinks with a tiramisu). It was just nice as the pastas weren't a lot. Food quality was there. Unexpectedly there was a Citibank discount which we didn't know until I presented my card. Perhaps the waitress can make it known to customers next time.
5
We often end up in Singapore for business or personal travel and stay most of the time at the Orchard Hilton. We always have at least one dinner at Il Cielo and come up regularly in the evenings for drinks or a late cup of tea on the roof. The name of the restaurant "the sky" in Italian is kind of obvious but well-chosen because this is one of the few open sky restaurants in town. In the evening, the soft breeze is very welcome and temperatures are clement. High up there are no bugs flying around and the noise of Orchard road below is far in the background. The chef has a very nice fine dining menu plus also some simple classics like stone-oven pizza and poolside food. You can sit inside or outside. Kids can even swim till 8pm or so while you dine. Very good for romantic candle light dinner on the covered terrace. Even if it rains, you can stay outside. Really great place.
4
The restaurant was located at level 24 of the hotel by the rooftop swimming pool. The dine in area was small but cosy and cooling. For weekday, the restaurant offered lunch set priced at S$25++ for 2 course and S$35++ for 3 course. I was showed to a table with a view of the swimming pool, plus a wooden stool to put my bag on. Looking the menu, I opted for the 2 course with a starter and a main course.Started the meal with the bread basket, which consisted of a crusty bun, a squid ink bun, a olive bun and a couple of sesame seed crackers. It was served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.Black Angus beef carpaccio with Parmigiano CheeseThe thinly slices of meat looked rather raw but lightly seasoned it tasted quite well with the strong flavoured cheese and greens. Roasted baby chicken, bell peppers & truffle mayonnaise It was nice that the meat was cut into small pieces which made it easier to slice for eating. The chicken was tender and quite flavourful. For a person who did not like bell pepper due to its rather raw taste, there was none here.Ended the meal with a cup of rich coffee and almond biscotti.Service was great with the staff asking about the meal, enquiring if I needed more sauce
4
Came here for a business lunch where the criteria was quiet, classy and uncrowded. Il Ceilo ticked all the boxes. The set lunches are excellent value and highly recommended, especially the desserts! Recommend that you ask for a table by the window and facing the pool (although on a cloudless noon, the glare from the sun can get a bit uncomfortable for the eyes). Otherwise a seat inside is just as good. Ambience of the restaurant is great and makes you forget you are in busy Orchard Road. For larger groups, ask for the private room and get a real treat and more privacy. Would definitely come here again, for either business or pleasure
5
Food : 8/10Service : 10/10 Ambience : 10/10 We went for a late dinner , and they had reserved a table for us. But as we arrived a table close to the pool was just vacated and not yet cleaned. We requested to move to this table , and the restaurant was very forthcoming to prepare the table for us. The staff was very friendly Great selection of Wines and good food.The Menu does not show too many Vegetarian options , but our server offered us various options on request. We had been to the restaurant before and had loved the experience. We enjoyed being there again . Last time we we in the restaurant , we loved the experience even more since they used to prepare the Buratta Cheese balls right there in front of you . This has changed now . The Agile Olio could have been better The Asparagus Risotto was brilliant . Pizza was excellent too . Service was prompt and exemplary The ambience is great at this restaurant , and we love sitting at the edge of the french windows , putting us at the edge of the beautifully lighted pool.
4
The food and the service here are really excellent, but tis not the type of place you want to go to for a quick lunch. We came here for lunch during a workshop in the Hotel and we were constantly asking them to hurry up, which was a shame as the food was really so good
4
Located on the 24th floor of Singapore Hilton, the restaurant also has a nearby rooftop poolside bar - what a view with such a relaxing ambience. The restaurant is semi-open as it opens out to the pool. Look forward to returning.
5
All the staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a great evening bday dinner. Overall 10/10
Will visit again next time for sure.
4
The food is very nice, however there is not a very extensive menu and no options for children. Service was good, and there was a lady singing, which was very nice.
5
The roof top bar is a nice place to have pre-dinner drinks with happy hour from 7-10. Great service and delicious food.
5
The service was great and the atmosphere relaxing, and naturally comes at a price tag. The birthday cake was a pleasant surprise and we appreciated it.
4
Small and cosy place with great service by the staff there! Loved the experience :) it is a good place for couples
4
Great food with a great view. Awesome service too. The lamb shank we had was cooked to perfection. They even brought in our favourite wine upon request.
4
Excellence place for couple looking for place to bring your other half for dining. Food and service is good. Do try some of their recomendation wine paring for food or dessert.
5
Excellent food and venue is great. staff are very friendly. Food is pricey but it's worth it. would definitely drop by again one day!
5
It is in a good location where you can find it easily. The restaurant located inside Hilton Hotel. The live music was good when I was there. Abit too pricey for the beverage on Valentine's Day. I got 2 glasses of champagne and 1 bottle kf sparkling water which cost me about $65
5
Booked the Valentine day 4 course set dinner to go with my love. Starters were awesome. But the Main wasnt that fantastic. We both love the dessert. Still Yummy overall! Worth a visit!! Great ambience and staffs were very friendly and helpful!!
4
Good place to go for a romantic dinner. Nice ambience and music. Food is good but a bit too oily. Nice desserts
5
I had the reservation done one day ahead. It was my Silver Jubilee wedding anniversary. I was very pleased with the food and the servings. This was my first time here and I will come again with my family again.
5
Try this restaurant first time because it is roof top restaurant. The food & view is good. The price is reasonable in a 5 stars+ hotel.
3
Place is decent, with a nice terrace...it serves all kind of western and some asian dishes, especially the salads are good.
5
Food was good but the service great and so was the atmosphere and ambience. The set lunch was good value
2
Food was really disappointing, lacked flavors and turned out cold for some of the dishes. Not worth returning at all
4
Had the festive set meal for dinner. Very affordable pricing. Good ambience. Portion is rather mini but it fills the tummy too :) Even had a complimentary birthday cheesecake for my fiance (plus points)! overall, a rather great experience. will dine again @ il cielo
3
I chose il Cielo for a business lunch to extend hospitality to some colleagues. In part, my decision was based on convenience because I was staying at the hotel. But, in the main, my choice of this venue was based on my previous experience of never having eaten a bad meal at a Hilton Hotel - in fact, up unitl this point I have had many favourable meals at various Hilton restaurants. Unfortunately, il Cielo did not live up to my expectations. The food was very average and the servings very small. In particular, my serving of snapper was so tough it was inedible and I gave up after a couple of mouth fulls. The only saving grace was the great conversation with friends over lunch. The venue is pleasant enough and the service efficient (perhaps too efficient - plates were being pulled away from you the moment you put your knife and fork down). I'll chalk this up to experience but would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience, especially for important or special occasions
5
I' ve been living in Sg since two years and tried almost all the Italian restaurant in Sg. This is definitely my favorite one. The chef Riccardo is an Artist and his food is awesome. He also knows how to interact with the guests and every time I go there he makes me feel at home that s why I m a regular guest. The location is also great and the service quality is excellent
3
Quality of the food very average for this high price, extreme expensive wine, very nice terrace and view
5
Attentiveness of staff was a plus. Was even surprised that they prepared a small birthday cake for my partner. Thumbs up
4
Nice ambience. Service is good. Their truffle sausage pizza St marvelous & will highly recommend their set lunch. Worth to try!
3
It is our very first experience to eat a raw pinkish lamb shank and it is terribly yucks. It is not value for the money that we spent.
5
Both the food and service were excellent. The ambience was also very conducive to hold a business meeting, while being able to enjoy a delicious lunch at the same time. Location is great.
2
Very attractive price for business lunchon but I wish I could say the same for their food... not recommended for lunchon perhaps their dinner is better but I have already lost my appetite..
4
Elegant and intimate venue situated by a lit poolside on the Hilton rooftop. The food is good, though without a wow factor. A singer/guitarist crooned from 8pm - personally preferred the serenity before that.
4
The location is central in Orchard Road. The restaurant's atmosphere is serene and overlooking the pool.The staff are polite and attentive service. The staff is also knowledgeable about what is being served. Not much waiting time when your food is served. The promotion is value for money if you book through Chope. The presentation of the food is not only attractive and palatable as well. Will recommend this place if you want quiet to talk business or bring your friends there for a good chat and also to enjoy your meals
3
I was disappointed. My fanciful seafood pea soup was just green veloute; the flavour of the peas had been killed by a mix of overcooking and, well, veloute. My squid ink risotto was a bit too salty and soupy. Our pizza was flavourful, but the crust was tough. And their bread sucks. The black charcoal roll they gave us was literally flavourless
5
Had a great time lunching at Il Cielo! Staff were really attentive to our needs and service was great! Food was also good and value for $! Appreciate the fact that the staff were very accomodating to our requests and really made our day! Thank you and we will be back! :
4
Excellent and attentive service. No doubt about good food and wine. Reasonable pricing for the set meal However, suggest a slightly wider range of food eg beef or pasta menu
5
By the small but decent pool on top of Hilton hotel, this restaurant provides good location, environment and food
5
Would definitely recommend others to try this restaurant. It is private yet have a cosy ambience. A good place for dates and celebration!
4
We enjoyed the great food. Ambiance was nice for a hotel restaurant, but remains a bit stiff. Service excellent.
5
The food overall was nice. The poolside environment provided a quiet setup for couples intending for a romantic date. The staff were attentive and I Guess due to the small scale, it's better to book in advance.
5
I'm discovering that the restaurants in Singapore with the best understanding of the gluten free diet, are in hotels. From arrival I was assured that the set menu we had booked for Singapore Restaurant Week would be modified to fit my dietary needs. The food didn't disappoint. Every course was delicious and the service was friendly and efficient. The gluten free bread was delicious. We'll be back again
4
The ambience is ok, it is located the top floor of the hotel. It is not a big restaurant and is good probably for couples who like some privacy. (7.5/10)Service is good and the waiter and waitress are quite attentive. (8/10)Food and price : I can only rate it as (7.5/10). Went during restaurant week, so paid about 58++ (about 67.86 after taxes). I have had steak and it is quite good.Overall: I would probably only revisit if there are promotions
5
Who would have guessed that hidden away on the 24th floor of the Hilton Hotel on Orchard Road would be a restaurant of such excellence? Under the watchful, attentive eye of General Manager Laurence Burog, the dining room is beautifully attended by an excellent team of server staff. With views over the pool and skylilne that are especially lovely at night, the setting is just perfect for a quiet conversation or romantic meeting. But the real star of Il Cielo is the cuisine of Chef Riccardo Catarsi. Delicate, imaginative, and clearly the product of an inspired mind, the food at Il Cielo stands out and keeps you coming back. Il Cielo is definitely on my list for future visits to Singapore
5
Good ambience. Excellent service and scrumptious Italian food. I used Chope to reserve the seats so the main course came with a free appetizer/ dessert. There is complimentary parking too. It is a small and cosy restaurant. There is a private room if you have a large group of 10 people
5
As one of the restaurants in Singapore to be awarded the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)’s Chain of Custody certification, Il Cielo prides itself in featuring 100% sustainably sourced seafood. The gigantic shell topped with chunky truffle-scented scallops and freshly shaved black truffles was heavenly.The thin crust pizza with a crispy edge, was loaded with a generous amount of ingredients. Had the half-half, one with truffle mushrooms and the other with lobster and caviar. Love this too.Tried the seafood stew as well, broth was more towards tomato-based.Also had the dessert platter in sampling portions to round off the meal
5
It's a very nice Italian restaurant and yummy food. The vegetarian options were limited but the chef made us whatever we wanted. The rooftop view by the pool is amazing. It was a perfect dinner for a perfect anniversary
4
The food is nice and the credit card promotion (free 1 bottle of wine with minimum $100 spent) was very good!
4
Food is good & the service is also standard. Environment was a little sleepy (may be because we were there on a Sunday evening). The pool side seating was closed so it was a disappointment but Overall it's good place for dinner.
4
I had my wedding anniversary dinner at this restaurant. Although the menu seems a bit overpriced, I have no complaints about the food taste, the attentive service, and the free red wine courtesy of a Citibank promotion.
4
I had the asparagus menu in this restaurant. truly a very good meal, all based on asparagus. great recommendation of wines by the friendly staff
5
We spent two nights at Hilton after our wedding. Service staff was really good, almost perfect. They were attentive, yet not intrusive. Atmosphere was relaxing and peaceful. We had the white asparagus menu, which was tender and delicious.
1
If you are staying here - then you can walk to another restaurant for the same price but better. I ordered the set menu for 2. I received a salad - leaves only and a few thin slices of fennel and the main which was literally 5 pieces of ravioli. The price was $72 SGD. We were HIGHLY disspointed at this place. Expensive, food taste is fine. Bu
5
One of the most discreet Italian restaurants in Singapore with some of the most amazing food! Classy decor with a private room available. Must try the angle hair lobster, truffle and mushroom pizza and deserts. Fantastic service with excellent selection of wine. Perfect spot for a business dinner or a romantic evening with the wife
4
The service was excellent. They were attentive. Despite my family arriving 15 minutes before they open, the waitress allowed us to sit in the restaurant and look at the menu. The food was great too. We had good calamari and scallops. The pasta is recommended as well. The restaurant faces a small pool which is an interesting view. The evening was great.
5
I was very impressed by the service standard at the restaurant. I was nursing a cough that night and one of the waitresses actually made a hot honey lemon drink for me upon my arrival. And that was just the start. Next when another waitress found out I was gluten intolerant she got the chef to prepare a dish of grilled vegetables for me bearing in mind that I would not be able to enjoy the flour coated calamari that my partner had ordered.The chef coming down to chat with us and helping us take photos also added warmth to the whole experience.The food was good and reasonably priced. But the service standard was what blew me away. I felt very well looked after. Great job il cielo guys
3
Thank you for the lovely pasta.
And the christmas choir on christmas eve. It really topped up the meal.
5
Quiet, nice place with pool view, excellent combination of food with professional and fantastic services from the service team..thank u 😄😉
4
Food are satisfied, as specially the scallops, its great. The atmosphere is average to me, although it is pool view, but the pool is not really nice thou.
2
The elevator pictures made this look good. It was kind of by the pool. Food was not great. My wife got hers about 3 minutes before mine. This is fine dinning? Not impressed with service. Oh yes place had a lot of empty tables, that should had been our first clue
3
Quite a so-so experience. We had the burrata which was really tasty and creamy, but it didn't come with any rockets or prosciutto like some other places I've been to. For mains we had the steak, which was a little tough, cold, and a little too drowned in sauce. We also had the ravioli, which tasted nice, but overall not explosive enough. Live music was quite nice but the ambience is not really as romantic as people say
4
I stayed two weeks in the Hilton for a business trip and ate twice in the restaurant. Good decent food with some good red wines by the glass. Italian orientated food. Service is very good but prices a little extraordinary. Romantic place at top deck of the Hilton hotel. Nice for couples
5
My husband and I dined at this restaurant on Saturday night. We had very friendly greeting from the Maitre De, Laurence, and were seated at a very nice table overlooking the pool on the rooftop of the Hilton. There is also a private dining room and a great Bar overlooking the skyline of Singapore.This would be a brilliant venue for either a private or corporate event. The menu is extensive. the Maitre De and Chef went through the menu with us and helped us select our courses. I am not a big eater so Chef did 4 smaller tasting plates for me which was fantastic - it gave me an opportunity to try different dishes. This was exceptional service and made our whole experience very personal. Every course was delicious. I can highly recommend the Artichoke Risotto. It is obvious that Chef spends a lot of time planning and developing the menu. Service was extremely good. I can highly recommend this restaurant for all foodies. It was truly a fantastic dining experience.
5
After a long hiatus, we returned to Il Cielo for what was a fabulous evening. The food was delicious, the service excellent (rare in Singapore) and the setting was lovely. The pasta was some of the best in Singapore and it is truly a gem on Orchard Road. We had a wonderful visit at our table by the charming chef Catarsi, who was warm and welcoming. We were surprised and delighted by this extra attention, which sadly is not common in Singapore. They also had a local musician playing the guitar and singing. A special treat. We will definitely return again and want to spread the word to others
4
Perched at the 24th floor of the Hilton hotel, it is by no means the sky as it's name suggests. While it lacks an awesome view with many of its neighbours towering over her, it made up for its lack of height with good ambience, good food and good service. We had the Valentines set menu which came with a rose. The rose had a dark patch and did not appeared fresh. Food was fantastic and staff was attentive to our needs. Had a pool side view with beautifully decorated tables enhancing the lovey dovey vibe.
4
I made reservation thru CHOPE and left a message that it will be a surprise birthday celebration. The restaurant is on Level 24 of the Hilton hotel. It is very cozy with a nice view of the blue swimming pool. We were seated at the poolside. The ambiance is good for dates, catch ups and business deals. The staff were friendly and attentive. We had the scallops specialty starter. It was interesting due to the cinnamon spice and cooked to perfection. I ordered the raviolli and may I add, it is one of the best raviolli I ever had. I have been to many Italian restaurants around the world. The raviolli with black truffle had a pleasant surprise of goodness in the centre... the bone marrow goodness...After our main, the staff surprised my bf with a slice of cake and we shook hands with the chef. Overall, we had enjoyable dinner. A lil tip I may add is for the staff to explain the dish as it is presented / served to the customers. It gives the customer the 'fine' dining experience. Cheers
4
Nice cosy and quiet ambience.
Food was good. Had Butternut Soup, Hokkaido Scallops, Cacciucco Livornese & Black Angus Beef.
Nice Cheese cake too.
5
Tried it for our dinner during stay and was greatly impressed with food, beverages selection and attentive service, location and atmosphere of restaurant is just perfect for romantic dinners.
5
Everything was nice. The service was simply marvellous. I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and they presented a surprise cheese cake for her. She was totally surprised. The food and atmosphere were great. Would love to go back in the near future.
4
We went to this site in before midnight.
Not so many people in here at that time.
It's so comfortable hiding Orchard busy street.
3
il Cielo's previous chef, Omar, was fantastic. Great interpretation and creative dishes. this visit was average to good. Nothing exceptional. I missed the Tiramisu, which was described as 3 temperatures, 3 textures and 3 flavored. Now, it's just ordinary.
4
Even this place has been renovated. Not sure it's to the better. What once had an amazing view of Orchard is now all closed off. And although the shadows of the pool water beautifully reflect against the tarpon of the walls, I'd rather see out. But alas, you can always get up from your chair and walk to the edge of the roof to see the views, and it is open toward the south and Marina Bay.Besides, you go to a restaurant for the food, right? They were out of the lobster (bad!) which disappointed someone in our party, but the meats were absolutely perfect and the service was prompt and very friendly. They also have a decent wine list.So why choose to dine in heaven? Well, we had arrived after a longish trip and were tired, and we stayed at the hotel. That's a good reason. The food certainly is another. But would I come to this restaurant if I didn't stay at the Hilton? Probably not, but if you're a resident, give it a shot

On October 30 to the 1st of November 2015, I spent 3 nights at the Singapore Hilton. And ate twice Il Cielo. The service was very good the food was good and the place also good. I would not go out of my way to look of this restaurant again, but the experience was ok.The restaurant was small and cold the first time I ate lunch there, and since it was a late lunch there were very few people there. The wine selection was good and the ambiance not very interesting. The second time I ate there, was for dinner and we ate outside over looking the city, the restaurant was totally booked up so we were second row and couldn't see much. The food was ok, the ambiance much improved, it was no longer cold. We ordered pasta and salad. I liked the salad the pasta was not great but ok. I was surprised that this restaurant was recognized as a good Italian restaurant, because it was so so. The first lunch I ate there I ordered risotto and that was quite good. All in all, it was an ok experience but I would not go there again if I did not stay at the Hilton

Il Cielo is located in the pool floor area, however, you will not get a great view of Singapore from the restaurant. The service is good and attentive. The food is good but in my opinion some dishes can be more spectacular than other. If you order the fresh pasta you would be delighted. I was not looking forward to go to an Italian restaurant in Singapore but the fresh pasta here is delicious! other dishes such as the steak or salmon were pretty average.It is a nice place with a nice ambiance

I was invited yesterday for lunch to the Hilton Hotel, il Cielo restaurant on the top floor next to the pool. For S$35 you cant go wrong here. Choice of 2 appetizers a main course, dessert and a coffee. Not many places in Singapore at this price level, even on a set menu. Its very quiet up there, not many people but that for me was an attraction as I had a business meeting and wanted a quiet environment. I found the service exceptionally good, but it was not busy so if you cant get good service when there are not many people then you are really in trouble. But courteous staff and overall a very positive experience

Excellent ambiance in an intimate yet open setting overlooking the rooftop pool. Food quality and presentation excellent with only downside being service which was a little confused and could benefit with a little training to make sure all guests are receiving attention. The wine we choose was also of high quality but unfortunately again could have been better enjoyed if the wine had been sufficiently chilled.However after saying this the Staff received our comments with grace and genuinely looked as if they had heard us and will do better next time.My wife and I enjoyed the experience and we will definitely give it another go when hopefully my next review can change my star rating from a 4 to a 
4
Good food, nice staff, location interesting. During the day you are next to the hotel pool but separate entrance
4
Quiet place, on 24th floor, ideal for a talk. They serve original Italian food in bento box equivalent for a reasonable price.
Good service, discreet and efficient.
Will try one day for dinner.

Thanks to the staff and chef for the great dining experience, it is still one of the best italian restaurant in town

Very nice ambience here. It is not the highest restaurant in Singapore but quite high up, on the 24th floor of the Hilton. The food was not fantastic but it was very good. We had calamari as an appetiser and mahi-mahi for the entrÃ©e with a glass of white wine. The service was excellent. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience on top of Singapore
2
The venue on the 24th Floor was great, but because of an electronic failure the roller blinds could not be raised so we couldn't see it. we chose a more romantic tabel poolside, but no candle was provided (just a very faint battery fed blue night light) so it was difficult to see either the menu or the food. despite a spanish name, the restaurant served basically Italian food. however the cooking style was several decades old with heavy brown and dull sauces smothering the dishes we chose (angel hair pasta and lobster tail pasta). There was no lightness of touch and no attempt at originality. In the event neither of us finished the main course. The bill was $289 for two, and we left feeling that we got poor value.

We hat a wonderful experience "Il Cielo" yesterday. The setting on the 24th floor of the Hilton Hotel is lovely, the food mixed antipasto, fusilli with duck ragout and ravioli plus delicious cacciucco was tasty and visually appealing. Chef Riccardo explained everything and to top it all my daughter whose birthday we were celebrating got a birthday cake as dessert without us asking for it. We'll definitely go again
3
If you are looking for a convenient meal or need to host a business meal, this is a good location (rooftop, open air) with an okay menu. Overpriced, in my opinion. There are other options within walking distance (California Pizza Kitchen virtually next door, shopping mall food courts 2 blocks away) that are more budget friendly if you have the time and prefer something less formal. A good restaurant to make an impression, though
5
The three of us (2 adults and our teenage daughter) had a lovely meal with superb service on Saturday night. The setting is lovely. Our table was at the edge of the restaurant so the temperature was perfect - not hot and not too air-conditioned. The waiter suggested a very nice white wine to start and we then had a lovely French red with our meal. 
1
Booked a table online for 10pm on a very 7th April 2015...I turned up with my other half (on our honeymoon) at 10:04 only to be told that the head chef has gone home, and that the only dish available was pizza, not really what you expect for a top restaurant. We ended up going elsewhere and were very happy, thankful that il cielo was so rubbish in its treatment of a booking. Don't go here, the staff don't understand what service means!
2
Today I tried to make reservation. I am staying in the Hilton Hotel and I phoned early afternoon and was told the restaurant was fully booked.I went to the Sky Bar at 7.15pm, right next the restaurant, before going to dinner else where. I ordered 1 beer. 2 different waiters had talked to me about ordering food.I said I would order when I ordered my next beer. After finishing the beer I sat there for 20 minutes being totally ignored. I left at 8pm. The restaurant had 3 tables with diners, less than half full! Fully booked, I don't think so! I could have been dining from 7pm!I have dined at Il Cielo before, 2 years ago and my impression back then was overpriced pretentious pizza! Margherita pizza with Maine Lobster and caviar! or Italian Sausage with truffles! C'mon! What about a standard margherita pizza with out the fancy smancy toppings!.BTW Sky Bar has a nice view down Orchard Rd but that's about the only thing going for it. No music, no atmosphere and bad service. 1 beer in 45 minutes! Well done guys

This is a special event restaurant as reflected in the substantial price level. However food and service are first class. It is located on top of Hilton Singapore and has views.
5
Our compliments to Ristorante Il Cielo by Hilton Singapore, friendly staff, eccellent food and drinks....all original made in Italy...and being Italian really you feel like eating in Italy..

We came here for our anniversary dinner on a Tuesday evening.Walked in and were stunned by the view! They have a nice lounge area next to the pool to have your pre-drink before dinner. We went with the recommendation of - French 2003 Medoc.Food was simply amazing. We had the assortment of il Cielo starters which came which was beautifully presented and had so many different flavors. Fried calamari and little fish, seafood and vegetables presented in a non traditional manner.We each had a pasta (seafood spaghetti and tagliatella) which were to die for and the portions were just right.The tiramisu as our desert to share just creamed it all off!At the end we got pleasantly surprised by the staff as they brought over a piece of their signature cheesecakes (made 90% from cheese) to congratulate us.My wife being a cheesecake lover, definitely one of the best ones we tried!Add to that relaxed ambiance and truly amazing service and you have a perfect night!Price: approx $150/pax for3 courses and win

Typical Singapore dining experience, expensive cuisine that is filled with disappointment. Have lived In Singapore for years and can honestly say (apart from local street food) that I've never had a food experience that makes me want to go back again. The food at il Celio was no exception, how to put it - bland and lacked any form of creativity or soul. The cheese board was the best part, then how wrong can you get that!. 
4
We visited il Cielo last Friday, 6th Feb 2015. First impressions of that place was that it was a really posh place. il Cielo was situated on the 24th floor of the Hilton Singapore. We were warmly greeted as we were led to our table. il Cielo ambiance was really relaxing, our table faced the pool and straight away you just soaked it the relaxing atmosphere of the place. We arrived around 1840 hrs. Once we had ordered, we were informed by the staff the kitchen would not start till 1900 hrs, so we decided to take a walk around the pool area. From the 24th floor, we were able to catch the sunset, it was amazing. From the pool lookout deck, we were able to view Orchard Road, nothing really spectacular but still the feeling of unwinding after a long work day was really good. Once we got back to the table, we were served with a variety of bread. Shortly after our meal was served. We ordered 2 pastas, 2 sides, 2 teas and 1 dessert. My 2 favourite were the seafood pasta which had a generous serve of seafood and the tiramisu which was paired with the most awesome coffee ice-cream. The quality of the food was really good! You will enjoy every morsel of it. Do check out the pictures that I posted. You can see how much time and effort goes into the preparation of it. Overall I would give this place 2 thumb up for it's fantastic service and food. It's a really nice place if you just wanna unwind/chill out. It's also a fantastic place to celebrate special occasions

Went to il cielo to celebrate my anniversary. The ambience was gd and the food is very nice. Especially the lamb rack. I have inform the restaurant staff when making reservations that it was my dating anniversary. They serve us with a complimentary cheesecakes and the chef gave us another complimentary pastry meaning "sealed with a kiss" in French. The only down side was that There is a family gathering at the same day and the guests have 2 young children who were running around and screaming for the whole night. The parents were unable to calm them down despite the gentle reminder by the restaurant staff. Thereafter, we shifted to the bar. The restaurant staff was very nice and keep apologising to us. And gave us 2 complimentary mock tails as a service recovery which was a nice gestures. Despite the ups and downs in the dinner, overall I still highly recommend the restaurant to everyone. Will sure cm bck agai

We chose Il Cielo for my 60th birthday dinner. The food and wine were some way behind the location in experience and quality. Each of our three pastas was overcooked and had too much sauce: an Italian cooking basic error. The food we cook at home is so much better! The wine was expensive but 'so so' in taste.Not what we expected from Il Cielo.
3
The setting is quite nice, came here to celebrate my husband birthday. When the bread came, it wasn't warmed up and it's so so only. We ordered angel hair lobster, cod fish and seafood pasta. The cod was good but the rest was rather disappointing. The only saving grace was the dessert which cost $17 for a scoop of ice cream and a slice of Tiramisu, the ice cream is really yummy. But for the price you paid for this I expected more better food.
3
Let's start with the service. It is excellent! The wines? Very good. The food? Disappointing. We decided to go with the chef's recommendations and the food, although beautifully presented, was cooked without flair and certainly should not have been served lukewarm bordering on cool. The taste was unimpressive although the service and the excellent wines made up for a lot. The pool was under renovation and there were some workmen working in it with floodlights which made good entertainment as we dined. I have a feeling that the chef is trying too hard to be innovative whereas good Italian food already sells itself. After dinner, we decided to go to the lobby bar for a drink. That too was awful. There was a big screen TV in the bar area showing the news when we arrived. There was the war in Syria, the bombing in Gaza and the student protests in Hong Kong. Although reality, it is not conducive to the enjoying of a digestif after a mediocre dinner and the final nail in the coffin for the Hilton, for us. We will not be going back for some time

I'd been wanting to dine at il Cielo Restaurant & Bar for a while, and hence we made our way there on a Saturday evening. Unfortunately, the pool was undergoing renovations, because dining by the beautiful pool was one of the main reasons I had wanted to come to il Cielo. Non-fazed, The Beau and I were seated in the exquisite, intimate little restaurant with dim lightings, well-spaced tables and emanating quietly elegant vibes.My starter was the 47 Degrees Cooked Salmon, served with yogurt sauce and saffron dust. The tiny cubes of salmon were delicious, no doubt - texture a cross between bouncy raw sashimi and the softness of smoked salmon. The pairing with yogurt sauce was brilliant, enhancing the sweetness of the fish with a savoury-sour overture.For mains, I'd chosen the Roasted Octopus, served with polenta and parsley sauce. The octopus bore a lovely smoky flavor that combined well with its naturally delicate, sweet flavor. It was also grilled to a lovely tenderness that the teeth sliced through very easily. The grilled peppers on the side, and parsley sauce were charming accompaniment, no doubt; it was overally, a very enjoyable dish.For his mains, The Beau had the Porchetta D'Iberico (SGD$44.00) - roasted iberico pork tournedos, served with sweet mashed potatoes and morels. The meat came in rolls form, and flaked off juicily and scrumptiously - there were a little fats on the side that added to the bounciness of the overall texture. The dish was paired brilliantly with plums that added a sweet flavor to the savoury red meat rolls.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/dinner-at-il-cielos-italian-restaurant.htm

Visited Il Cielo to celebrate my birthday. Very pricey, especially drinks. The food was nothing special and the portions were tiny. I had to ask for salt and the waiter showed obvious disapproval.The place lacked atmosphere- lighting and music were just wrong. Disappointing.
5
this was our first time dining here and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Great food fantastic service. Would definitely fine here again
5
Very nice dining atop the wonderful Hilton Singapore with grat views of the city. Had sea bass which was some of the very best I had ever tasted.
3
We had read many reviews about il cielo and were looking forward to dinner.Food excellent, service excellent, ambience poor. Il cielo meaning the sky,normally has stunning views of the Singapore skyline being based by the side of the rooftop swimming pool. On Friday evening the whole swimming pool area was a building site closed for renovation and the restaurant windows were closed with the blinds down.Which made the whole experince rather claustrophobic and disappointing.What was frustrating was that we were not informed of this situation when we bookedThe not inexpensive bill did not reflect the missing view !

Cozy Italian restaurant on the 24th floor of the Hilton Hotel. Only 8 tables so be sure to get a reservation. They have an outstanding wine selection, hand picked by their French Sommelier, Stephanie, who will tell you all about the wine, the grapes,the region, the blends, etc. Many great estate selections here which are pleasant surprises. Besides dining, a great place for an evening cocktail on the outside, candlelit deck.
4
We love the thin crust pizza. It was very crunchy.We also shared the 1.2 kg tomahawk steak. It was terrific. It was served medium rare and you put one slice at the heated grill on the table. The meat was a bit fatty (by definition) and after you heated it, it melts in your mouth
2
Had a 4 course $55 set lunch today. Rating of 2 was given for the atmosphere. Food was really below average. Service was good except the waitress did not clear that 1 piece of cooked vegetable that one of the eating companion had dropped on the table mat. When the dessert was served, the piece of fallen cooked vegetable was pushed to a side with the dessert plate. She should have cleared the piece of vegetable as we are the only table that was occupied throughout the whole 2 hours of lunch there
4
The restaurant opens out on to the pool deck on top of Singapore's Hilton Hotel, with a view down Orchard Road. During the day, this might not be the quietest spot to enjoy a meal but on a quiet midweek night it's a very pleasant spot. The food is excellent and the service knowledgeable. A quail and mushroom risotto in particular was very good
4
We had the goats cheese, walnut, honey salad for a starter and the fresh lobster pasta for the main. Whilst both dishes were tasty, they did not live up to the "fine dining" photos in the elevators (at the Hilton - this place is on the top floor) advertising the restaurant, so over all we were a little disappointed. nevertheless is was quite good for Singapore as most places, no matter what cuisine, have a leaning to the Asian influence
3
Living close to Italy, the prices for the dishes were a shock. But the service is very professional and attentive. The lamb rack with the herb crust was just perfect. Without ordering, the restaurant served an "Amuse Bouche", a tasty mushroom soup with a black truffel and a campari sorbet in between which helps to digest the high price of starter and main dish. I am a wine lover and a good meal comes with a glass of wine. The selection for wine by the glass is poor and the prices for bottled wines set new benchmarks for a frequent traveller like me!I have no complain on food and service but I think you find other alternatives in Singapore below this price range
1
Do yourself a favor please avoid this up market eatery. We have just left this restaurant where pasta with scampi means one lone ranger!!! Lovely view but really many more options at your whim, avoid.
5
Had a great meal at il cielo. The sommelier helped us with a great wine recommendation and the truffle pizza was one of the best i have ever had. Very relaxed up on the roof by the pool at night

I had booked here 2 months ago to ensure the best available seating to an enormous special occasion for myself and my husband. Not once but on 4 occasions ( including today) I have spoken to the restaurant & Hotel to ensure a special seat. Didnt care whether it was in the bar or restaurant, just wanted special spot to ensure we could celebrate to the level as we have always been able to before. Today I was ensured the seating was indeed the best. So on arrival, to be placed directly inside the door was devastating. Then to be not informed; but given fixed menu for our meal, was yet another reason to be utterly dissatisfied with this place. After requesting a traditional menu, we ate our meal and left. What a waste of effort. Not only am I putting this here, as gold Hilton members it will also go to the Hilton site.Big Hilton Fan. Bad Il Cielo Critic
5
This restaurant in the Hilton is undercover by the side of the roof top pool. Open for lunch, it is stunning by night. We were offered a large a la carte menu as well as several fixed menus. We chose a menu that featured truffles after the Chef brought over a container of the fragrant white delicacies.The meal was absolutely delicious, especially the risotto, the veal and the unusual tiramisu. It is great value too. We recommend it highly!! in a city of great restaurants, this is a stand out
5
every time I come to Singapore, I cannot resist... at least one dinner at Il Cielo, it's a must.Once again, top notch quality in a classy place, VIP treatment... yeah, it does not come for free, but it's worth all the S$ you'll spend.Special remark this time goes to the Barbaresco by Chiarlo, one of the best wines ever in my view
4
Cupola di vitello tonnato was a perfect harmony of tastes, at least ours, with a hint of black truffle in potato. The one Pinot Noir on the list we liked very well, too. The rest was ok but nothing extraordinary to mention, ecxept for the tasty complimentary sorbet. Service was was very friendly. Quite a high price for the whole experience was pretty much compendated by the nightly view and the feeling of being on the Singapore rooftop
3
Il Celio commands great vistas of the city skyline so I recommend going for dinner. The chef is Italian and is keen to keep the menu as authentic as he can. The menu offers a good variety of dishes which, whilst not disappointing, won't wow you. The service is generally good albeit a little snooty at times
2
In general the food was ok but I had a major issue with the fish. Maybe they don't get many people that know how a branzino looks like...I ordered the branzino but I got another fish...I know what a branzino looks like and how it is supposed to taste when grilled or baked....I was actually quite shocked when I saw the fish but to be honest I didn't want to open a discussion about it and I felt sorry for the waiters as it was certainly not their fault, but the chef's fault who is Italian and certainly knows what a branzino is! The fish they gave me was ok, but very small and the meat certainly didn't taste like branzino, it was quite lean. The mediterranean branzino's meat is quite fatty.I had mediterranean branzino in a restaurant in New York and it was the real thing, so I thought they could have it in Singapore too and if the menu says so, then that is what I should get!To be honest, to me it felt like a fraud as I paid for a fake.For this reason, I don't advise to eat at this restaurant
3
I was staying at the hotel and there was an offer for hilton points after a meal here so i went for itOn top of the hotel by the poolside, it also has the half AC and half outdoor feel opening up to the pool. There are only about 10 tables but no matter, on a saturday night, only 4 tables were taken. And 3 were single dinersI first ordered the prosecco, which was ok. Decided to jump right into the main and had the risotto with frog legs. The 3 tiny miserable legs were tasty, but probably not enough protein to counter the carbs. I ended with the cheese platter and there were 4 italian cheeses, which they serve with the same bread at the beginning of the meal. Huh? The apparently undertrained server tried to rattle off the names of the 4 cheeses and could only get 2 right the first try. She had to ask a couple of other servers. And most of the cheeses ended up not being very goodNothing fantastic about this place, probably a missed opportunity to do better her
5
The food was amazing! The service was exceptional. They have some great appetizers! The main courses were delicious! The wine selection was amazing! It is a very small restaurant with just a few tables - but worth any wait! The chef even came out to speak to us during the meal to ensure we were satisfied with the food! Overall a great first night in Singapore. Plus, when the sky is clear great rooftop dining! Very impressed
4
Service and food was amazing, great view across the rooftop pool. Would recommend eating here, especially if you need a break from Asian food.
5
Think of a cozy place with just 8 tables, with the highest service standard... Plus, first class real italian food, homemade pasta, fish from tuscany, great wine selection... No, it's not the last trattoria in Siena or Rome or Venice... It's Il Cielo at the 24th floor of the Hilton in Orchard SingaporeA great Master Chef (Omar) who will give you a real experience ... Invluding the sorbetto between pasta and main course (yes!) and the best espresso in tow
4
Beautiful location on top of Hilton. Great panorama view. It was like eating art. 1 tbsp for $50. They make their own buffalo mozzarella which was awesome. I had the steak and was a great amount. Nice place would recommend if u want to impress someone.
5
Il Cielo is an amazing restaurant. Great location, small enough to be intimate and big enough to have a decent size party. The food was amazing and the service A1 bordering on stellar. The bill actually was not too bad at SG$420.00 for two for a four course meal including champagne and wine. My partner and I were certainly full by the time we left the restaurant.No complaints at all about this place. I will certainly be back again!!
4
Not only is this walking distance from home it has an excellent ambiance, views across the pool and skyline and the food was pretty good. It beat last week's mediocre steak hands down. Crab salad and veal chop were very good. Service was a little in attentive but it was busy. Very restful setting. Wine list was mostly Italian but plenty of good Italians were to be found. Sasacaia is at the top end but they had a range of vintages to choose from. That was very good as well
4
Very good and creative italian food, served with top notch service. Though the portions are very very small and prices are sky high. I ate burrata cheese as a starter which was delicious and prepared at the table. All done "comme il faut" with a pleasant show element added to it. My main dish was pasta which as very tasty though it looked more like an appetizer : very small portion, luckily served with delicious tomato bread. Otherwise, I would definitely be hungry. Hilton/Il Cielo : is this such a huge difference to make the portion a little bit bigger ? You don't want to have hungry customers after visiting your restaurant, do you ? Pasta is not that expensive and will not make a lot of difference.... Also the tiramisu with mascarpone icecream was a real delight. All served with a Chianti Classico (very expensive). Quality of the food was great : all fresh ingredients and all very tasty. Too bad the portions are so small, otherwise I would be a regular customer. This all comes at a (very high) pricetag. I might be back as I truly enjoyed the food. Though, might visit first McDonalds next door to kill some of my hunger and then enjoy the great food. We were also surprised that the place was nearly empty. 3 tables only with people
3
This Italian roof-top restaurant at the Hilton has a nice view of the blue-lighted pool at night. When I ate there, only one other table was occupied. That doesn't speak very highly of its popularity. It might be that the portions, while of good quality, are quite small and definitely on the expensive side. Count on a total cost of around S$100 per person by the time you're done, unless you really just stick to an entree and water. While the meal was well prepared with good attention to detail, there are many restaurants within a short walk on Orchard Road that compete with this place. It was nice, but I can't make a compelling case to spend the money to come here as opposed to the other options available
3
My wife and I had dinner here recently and enjoyed the meal and will compliment the service. The restaurant overlooks the pool area of the Hilton and we watched the full moon rising as we dined. The glass doors that open to the pool were open and the atmosphere was quite nice.We had a bottle of forgettable wine. We shared a nice seafood appetizer and I had fish while my wife had a pasta dish. The pasta was good and so to was the fish. The fish was deboned at the table by the waitress and she did a pretty good job of it.They did a lot of things right here and I am torn between average and very good. In the end the although a great deal of potential the meals we had were average
5
The service is fantastic with wonderful attention to detail. Wine list is very solid with always creative suggestions from the staff - definitely ask what new wines they have found. Pizzas are thin and crispy...as they should be! Mains provide a nice variety of meats and pastas that are prepared with surprises. Intimate roof top dining with open air seating that is still air conditioned so you can enjoy the meal at your leisure. While not cheap, I am willing to pay for consistently great food with service to match

During Christmas week, my girlfriends and I had lunch at il Cielo, located at the rooftop of the Singapore Hilton Hotel. It was my fifth or sixth time at il Cielos', but it was the first for my friends. I like that it is a small restaurant with nice and simple decor and pretty good service. The restaurant is glassed up on one side, allowing for a poolside view. I always ask for one of the tables right next to the glass wall. If its too glaring, the blinds can be pulled down.We ordered the pasta set lunch which costs under S$50 nett per person. To begin, we were given a complimentary but generous basket of nice warm bread, which was too delicious to resist. I had the tuna for starters and the angel hair pasta for mains. There is no dessert option but the creme brulee was yummy. What I like about il Cielo is they serve a variety of coffee (decaff included!) and its tea is served in a plunger, unlike other outlets that just mindlessly plonk a tea-bag in a cup!The wait staff is polite, attentive, helpful and patient. I rarely review restaurants but il Cielo is definitely a must-go to restaurant as the cosy atmosphere is pretty conducive for catching up with family and friends and the food quality is good. I will definitely return
5
A quiet, cozy Italian dining at the roof-top of Singapore Hilton property. Menu is simpler but the staff will make it better if you give your specifications. Food is good taste at affordable price. The pool side view tables are recommended for romance!
5
All food was very nice. New chef arrived same day so if they change again it may change.
5
We had "Thanksgiving" lunch there. As Americans, we were the only ones there who knew it was Thanksgiving, of course. Great services. The food was impeccable. We had venison that was good. Good wine list. We liked the view over the pool (on the 24th floor). Nice, quiet place for lunch. They closed at 2:30 and we stayed til 3:30 and I had no idea they closed at 2:30 as they made us feel completely at home
5
Firstly, in my opinion, there are a lot of italian restaurants in Singapore but many of them are not that good because of various reasons such as the noodles not being cooked al dante or lack of generosity etc. But this is one Italian restaurant which I dare say, is probably the best one I've visited so far (in Singapore).I ordered the Home made Burrata Cheese as my appetizer, a lobster linguine as my pasta, and I shared the Tomahawk Steak with my Dad and his banker. The home made Burrata Cheese was beyond excellent, it was rich in flavour and a real a treat to my taste buds. The lobster linguine, if I'm not wrong was made in a sun dried tomato-based sauce, the linguine was cooked al dante and the lobster (small maine lobster) was simply fresh and juicy. The Tomahawk steak was served together with a lava plate to heat up or further cook your steak in case you find it too rare as well as various sauces. In addition, throughout the meal, home-made bread (with great crust!) was also continuously served. Overall, it was a wonderful experience dining at il Cielo. I highly recommend this place for especially dates and client lunches. But, be prepared to pay for this quality food. No doubt everything turned out delicious, but this came with a hefty price
5
We had read and heard a lot about this restaurant and we finally got a chance last night to go there for dinner. From the moment we got there to the time we left everything was perfect. The service was in a class of its own, the staff were well informed on the food and wine. We had six dishes between the two of us not including the sorbets which included seafood, Waghu beef, lamb and vegetables. The deserts were outstanding. The quality of the food was nothing but the best and even the house pours were of great quality. All up $380 for two Will be going again for sure and highly recommended. Congratulations to the tea
4
The location was on 24 flr on top of the Hilton hotel, had view of the pool. The restaurant was done up nicely, modern with dark wood finishing, very classy indeed. My dining group ordered the 4 course set lunch, which included, starters, a choice of pasta, main course and dessert. I would say the bread selection was one of the better selection I have seen in Singapore! Well done. I tried the squid ink pasta, though i had a small starter portion, I actually craved for more. It was Squid ink pasta basked in a light Tomato sauce with seafood. The Salmon was cooked perfectly, not overcooked, succulent and laid on top a bed of very flavorful saffron risotto. The dessert was a nice sweet end to the meal, il Cielo, you will have been coming back for more
5
A top quality Italian restaurant in Singapore. The food was consistently excellent, we had starters, main and dessert and the service was also exceptional. My wife is Italian and it was up to her high standards. Additionally, we had our 12 month boy along(we arrived promptly at 6pm) and they made an effort to prepare a simple pasta for him. No doubt it is a bit pricey, but Singapore isn't cheap. Worth keeping in mind for a special dinner
4
Excellent quality food, great location and service is very, very good. Only slight thing to mention was the portion size of the pasta dishes - they came in a small salad bowl - not really worth the price or an indeed enough to fill a hungry adult!Worthy of note were the pizza starters to share - tast
5
This lovely restaurant atop the Hilton Hotel will not remain a secret for long, so long as the recently arrived Italian chef continues to churn out wonderfully delectable Italian morsels. Great ambience and tasty food; thirteen ladies (all residents of Singapore) recently visited for lunch and EVERYONE(!) enjoyed their dishes. The Chef came out twice to chat with us and the service was attentive...so Thank You Il Cielo Staff for making our luncheon deliciously enjoyable. Worth a return visit

I just ate at Cielo's in the Hilton Singapore and had the most unbelieveable Italian food. I had a chance to tolk to the Chef and he just recently arrived here from Italy. Everthing this was wonderful. The food was the right tempature and the right amount. The taste was the best and I think it equals the food I had in Italy about three weeks ago. I most likely will be going there several more time while I am here in Singapore this week.The venue was wonderful, it overlooked the pool which is on the top floor of the Hilton.Definitely a place to eat if you like Italian food
