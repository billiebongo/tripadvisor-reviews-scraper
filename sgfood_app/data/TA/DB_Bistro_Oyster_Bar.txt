Excellent French cuisine and other dishes. I am French and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food : chocolate moelleux like you would eat in France. Very nice waiters.

We always go to DB Bistro for our comfort food. We love the oysters and quite reasonable price, considering celebrity chef level.
4
We went for late lunch -The seafood platter was delicious and tasty-loved the oysters and the lobster. The sauces served with the platter was good . The waiter was very friendly and courteous.
Will visit again some day

Hunger striked so me and my wife decided to look for a nice restaurant where we could eat and relax for a while so we chose DB Bistro. I ordered burger and my wife tried the Oysters and it was really delicious great recommendation by our server Olivia! Not to mention dining was pretty busy when we arrived and yet she managed to make us feel comfortable and made sure that all our needs are well taken care of. She is for keep and such an asset to the restaurant and when we come back we will definitely look for her. Good food great service what else you would ask for? We left the resto with a full bellies and happy smiles kudos

Ive Been a loyal fan of dB for two years, every time I stumble thinking of where to eat, DB is the answer. Reservations can be made by chope (local booking app), service is up to Singapore standards - waiters able to pick and recommend the best items (and they always do this without fail). Although sometimes they happen to recommend the most expensive thing on the menu, I can look past that because like all restaurants , knowing what to order is crucial . Items that will NEVER fail, and has never failed me are :1. FRENCH ONION SOUP (CHEESE pull is real),2. Oysters , constantly sourced from around the world. Fave thus far are ones from ireland3. Mediterranean sea bass with cauliflower puree. Fish cooked to flaky perfection, crispy baked oven skin and a smooth,creamy cauliflower puree.4. Spaghetti Nero In general the seafood is amazing, the variery of the seafood both raw and cooked is commendable. Just avoid any form of meat and you'll be in for a treat

We shared the suckling pig for 2 @ Sing$ 88 .I admit I didn't read the full description ,after all suckling pig is suckling pig ,at least the many I have sampled .However this was all stuffing with a bare surround of actual meat .We stopped eating when we realised it was all stuffing ,we asked where the meat was but were politely told this was how it was described and this is how they serve it ,we were thanked for our feedback and asked did we want something else which is fair enough but in these situations you really don't want to go to the bother of starting over ,the accompanying veg by the way was a very small offering. The young lady said she would have a word with the chef about the description , may I venture pork sausage without the skin. The offending dish was described on the bill as CNY ( Chinese New Year ) Suckling pig ,yes it was Chinese New Year but any Chinese restaurant would have been ashamed to serve it. Sing$ 10 for still water and $19 for a tiny glass of Sauvignon Blanc ...not cheap but I usually don't mind paying but our last night in Singapore spoiled ,I'll stick with what I know next time

Tried their famous DB burger and it didn't disappoint! Patty was perfectly cooked the way I wanted it to be and the foie gras and short rib stuffed in it blended deliciously. The ambiance was nice and elegant. I would recommend making a reservation though since this place is always packed! My sister and I had to wait for an hour to get a table, so we just strolled around Marina Bay and came back after an hour
5
If you are expecting a posh and elegant experience here, you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. The service was outstanding, genuine and luxurious. And the food ... OMG ... amazing seafood, succulent steak and excellent wine!!! I would have to say that this was one enchanting experience

I was having lunch with my son. We order half dozen of fresh oyster to share, French onion soup, Steak Tartare, Maine Lobster roll and The original DB Burger. Only oysters were good and fresh. The waiter only bring one small fork for the oyster and expect us to share it !The French onion soup was so sweet and impossible to drink and I think they add to much sugar to it. The beef in the DB burger was so bland and I think they forgotten to add any seasoning and the foie gras was over cooked. A lot of cayenne pepper was added to the Maine lobster roll and make it hard to eat. It definitely too expensive to spend $220 on such a poor lunch
3
This restaurant claims to be a French restaurant. This is not true. Despite the fact that the majority of their clients are foreigners, they complacently transform their recipes to please those of their local Singaporean clients who always want something over-spicy. Practically all the items in the menu mention "spicy". And beware of those for which spicy is not mentioned, they are as spicy as the others. Food is well prepared with good ingredients. But believe me, I am French, and this is definitely NOT French cuisine
4
The food and cocktails are very good. The burger with foie gras is delicious. The selection of cocktails is impressive. However food is pricey and a bottle of water is $10
4
2nd visit and didn't disappoint, great fresh oysters, like being able to try the oysters from different region, is the 2nd time they had run out of lobster but plenty of other options. The crab cakes were really good and the wine list is extensive.
3
Had the trout, found it OK. I was expecting to be wowed by it given the great reviews about this restaurant. However, my colleagues that had the chicken thot it was better. Service was great though.
1
I went to DB with my bf who is lactose intolerant. We were told that there are only 5% of the whole menu he can order from and they refused to modify their signature burger for people with diet restrictions. I ordered a steak tartare, for the first time, I saw lettuce leaves in lieu of endives in a steak tartare dish! My bf ordered moules et frites in which most of the mussels escaped their shell and were scuba diving in the bland broth. Service was bad as the waiters just want to turn the table quickly, the gents’ washroom was not very clean. To sum up, we were extremely disappointed
5
Decided to give DB a try while staying at the MBS recently. I am a real fan of Maine Lobsters (THE true lobster ;)), so I was keen to have one while in Singapore (as they are still in this day and age practically non-existent back in AUS as compared to Asia). I started with a prawn cocktail, of which I would say was nice and fresh but the prawns weren't as tasty as we normally get at home. However, I was really pleased with the Lobster though and even despite my preference for steamed, the grilled style was prepared perfectly -not dried out like can sometimes happen under a griller. My wife really enjoyed her surf and turf of steak and lobster tail. The side were also really delicious, the seared brussel sprouts with bacon were great. We also were able to have one of our preferred french Rose's with the meal as well which really capped it off. All in all a great meal, especially for a spur of the moment decision

Sigh. This was the worst experience I had with DB Bistro. Was there for dinner to celebrate my son's birthday and was terribly disappointed with the service. To be absolutely fair, this isn't the first time we have been here but is the first time we have had such bad service. (1) they didn't get our orders right. i.e. they missed items that we ordered; (2) they either forgot or didn't order our drinks order and we had to put in the order a second and third time and even had to chase for the orders to be delivered (these are for drinks - not water. Not to be confused with point 3); (3) they didn't refill our water - we had to ask multiple times to refill the water, and when they did, they refilled one cup and left with other cups un-refilled. The food was good though mired by the experience
4
We spent a lovely hour sat at the bar in db, super friendly staff, great cocktails and a nice relaxed vibe. The bar area is an attractive space with seating all the way around (full food service available), we had a brilliant negroni (with db stamped into a giant distilled ice cube!), delicious godmother and a couple of other cocktails served by the handsome bar guy. Recommended

Went there on New Year's Eve and managed to get a table. Food was excellent, service really attentive and helpful with wine choices to match the dishes.Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the food and wines to compliment the dishes and so enthusiastic about the dishes which was great, so good when the staff have clearly eaten the dishes and tried the wines as it really adds to the experience
4
Choose this place from an impulse Did not regret it. Tried the foie gras with a sweet but smoked marmalade and perfectly toasted brioche. Wide variety of wines, especially French :-)Rib eye for main course, a little more than the ordered medium rare, but tasteful and rich. Not a cheap restaurant, but there is a food court close by if that’s a priority.
5
Over several visits since it opened, we have never been anything less than completely satisfied with any meal at Daniel Boulud's place at Marine Bay Sands. Our most recent lunch was no exception. The Caviar Bun, the pan-fried Foie Gras, and our burgers were all great. The service was immaculate, with for instance, the wait staff sensing correctly that the appetizers would be shared, and providing accordingly. It's not exactly "cheap eats" - but it is good value for money
5
Must try is the burger and steak ! Quality is good. White wine was good too. Abit pricey but portion was quite filling. Enjoyed the luncheon.
5
We simply walked by this place - which is located inside the Marina Bay Mall - and were lucky that they had space for the two of us. They served us with an excellent Châteaubriand with lobster tail. Also the dessert selection pleased us very much. The restaurant manager/sommelier also knows his stuff well and is a very good host. Definitely coming back... :-
4
I went for an event at MBS and it ended at 10pm, and both my husband and I were starving because we did not have our dinner yet. We were worried there was no where else for us to dine at. Thankfully the restaurant was still open and we had dinner there
3
I am not sure why but a few places in Singapore only offer Atalantic ocean oysters and DB is one of them.We had the dozen oysters, which included two species from France and one from New England. While the American oysters were nice and sweet and the French were generally creamy and briny, the overall size and grittiness of them was a little disappointing. The platter was over $90 including tip and tax. We had drinks separately
2
No discrimination intended but service staff was a Filipino whom we can hardly understand her when she speaks mainly because of her accent plus the restaurant was noisy. She also had our orders wrong - we ordered a dozen of oysters but was only served half a dozen. My friend wanted more garlic for her dish but it wasn’t done. Food was just so-so and yet costly. Rather disappointing for the price we pay

I came here with my family on 16 December for dinner to celebrate my father-in-law’s birthday. There were 5 of us plus a baby. I made a reservation through Chope and even called to check that the restaurant would be able to provide a baby chair. The lady who answered the call assured me that a baby chair would be provided.We reached at 7pm and my family was 2nd in line. When it was our turn, the staff at the reception allowed another lady to cut in front of us. This lady proceeded to repeatedly ask questions about whether she could get a seat without a reservation etc. Instead of politely telling the lady to wait for her turn, the staff ignored us. I was standing right in front of staff and I seemed to be invisible. Nevertheless, we waited quietly until we were allowed to speak. The lady at the reception immediately told us that she had reserved a table and already prepared a baby chair for us. Hence, I was willing to forget the earlier incident. However, when we were brought to our table, the waitress who brought us said “Table for 6?” and showed us a table with 6 seats instead. We had to request for a baby chair AGAIN. We all took our seats and waited for the baby chair. When the baby chair arrived, it was very dirty (refer to picture attached). We had to use hand wipes to wipe the chair and the wipes changed colour. There were even crumbs/leftover food on the chair. This is not what we expected of such an establishment. Various more affordable chain restaurants have provided us with baby chairs before and they have always cleaned them. We definitely did not expect to find food on a baby chair and we found this downright disgusting and unhygienic. The waitress then took orders for drinks. One of my family members ordered warm water. The warm water was served in a cup on a plate. As the waitress was trying to serve it, she spilled the water all over the plate (but still serviced it anyway). When we took a closer look at the plate, we realized that the plate was dirty (refer to attached photo). We also requested for a small bowl to feed the baby. The bowl did not come and we had to ask again. After perusing the menu, we decided to order. However, service seemed to be non-existent. Everyone seemed to be rushing around. We finally caught someone’s attention, only told “I’ll get someone for you”. Nobody came. At this point, we almost wanted to walk out of the restaurant. Fortunately, we finally managed to get someone to take our order. We ordered 3 steaks and 2 other main courses. When my husband’s order of a medium rare steak came, it was not medium rare. Once he sliced it open, he noticed it was over-cooked. The only redeeming point here was that a waitress actually came over to ask us how the food was and she brought my husband a new steak after he stated that it had been overlooked. Another family member of mine ordered a fish but the vegetables didn’t taste quite right. Overall, the rest of us were satisfied with our food. I would say that the steak is far better than the average steak I’ve had. Also, during the entire course of dinner, only the warm water was refilled. The rest of us were left with empty cups. We eventually decided to pass on dessert and head elsewhere.Overall, the experience at DB Bistro was a very disappointing one. We came here expecting a far above average dining experience. We weren’t expecting Michelin star treatment but we definitely expected far better service than what we would get at a fast wood chain. We also expected far better in terms of hygiene. Giving your customer a dirty baby chair with leftover food on it is simply unacceptable. While most of us enjoyed our food, the dining experience left much to be desired. We won’t be back again

Typical Boulud with a bistrot atmosphere. The restaurant is situated on level B1 of the marina bay sands shopping mall. Follow the sign for celebrity chefs. Menu is complete with tartare and bavette. The beef tartare is done in front of your table. Of course there is the famous Boulud burger. Service is efficient but to fast, you will have to slow them down. One thing, this place is ridiculously expensive. For exemple : 12 oysters for 75 SGD ou a burger for 45 SGD. There is two bottles of wine below 100 SGD and the list is not that great. Finally, the pièce de résistance, a glass of veuve clicquot for 40 SGD. Dont worry most of the other restaurants are very expensive to. You will get used to it.
3
I can’t believe I paid 45 dollars plus another 17% for taxes/service for a burger but then it was the signature dB Burger stuffed with foie gras, in a swanky celebrity chefs restaurant in the Marina Bay sands complex so what should I expect, you’re probably thinking. It was good though and the service was good. My wife’s duck confit was good. But, 20 dollars plus for a beer? Come on... rip off time. So for 2 mains, a beer, a glass of sav blanc, taxes and service the bill came to 141 dollars! Still can’t believe it, but I’ve had an experience to talk about
5
A friend who has been to this place took me and my wife to this wonderful restaurant.It was situated inside the giant Sands Complex.You may have to ask a bit to go there.But people are helpful.The decor of the restaurant has a relax and yet very French taste. it is also suitable for family , although probably not for very young kids.The kitchen is a semi-see-through. You can vaguely see inside through a sand glass. The bar is to one side.The service is good.We were first served with very good gougere. And if a restaurant is to be judged in anyway, I think it is best judged by the bread they serve you. And DB will get the highest mark.We ordered onion soup and lobster bisque. Although slightly more expensive, the bisque is much better and value for money, in my opinion.The bread basket that comes with our soup is also good.WE also ordered half a dozen of oyster for 40 SGD. It is on the expensive side and I think would be optional , if you are not on a big budget.The escargots , however, is good.The ladies ordered the lobster roll for their main. It is quite good.But my main of grilled sea bass surprised me. It is one of the best sea bass I ever eat. It is grilled to brown and vcsipy on the outside but yet still ery juicy on the inside.And for 40 SGD, I think it is a steal.I will definitely go back. My son will go to Singapore next week and I have already ask him to go there for dinner one night
5
It was super fast. We told them we were going to watch a play. They know exactly the schedule and how tight we were. From the time we were seated to order our food, got our food and made payment; everything was done at "Just in time". We loved our food and the services. We will go back to really enjoy our food here again, but slowly...
5
I enjoyed a delicious three course brunch. The dishes were exceptionally prepared on par with the best meals I’ve had in Singapore. What really set this meal was the service. Obviously a focus in the training and was top notch
4
my wife and i had two meals lunch and dinner the service was great can recomend the burgers and the steak wine list good
5
The lobster bisque here is simply divine! The interior had a very nice French bistro feel to add to the experience.
5
Came in for brunch and we ordered the burger and Brunch set.The burger comes with a generous portion of foie gras inside the patty ... absolutely yummy.The brunch set was very big portion ... starts with the pate then croque madame both were generous portions and very nice. It supposed to end with desert (we chose french toast) but as we were too full by then we asked for takeaway. Had the french toast after dinner, even tough it was already cold but impressively still tasted very nice ... I can only imagine it would have been even better when it's fresh and warm
4
When I ordered the db burger, I found that the meat was very juicy and the portion size was reasonable for its price. At other high end restaurants, customers usually need to have multiple dishes to be satisfied but with this delicious meal, I found it was the only thing needed. There was a variety of complimentary bread and one of the kinds was served right out of the oven. The atmosphere was nice, having dim lights and very little noise. I felt at ease at the restaurant which is something I don't normally feel at a place like this. The waiters responded very quickly when called and asked how I was doing when the food arrived. The one thing I must say is that of the three times I have been there, the waiting time for the food always has been quite long with the shortest time being 20minutes and the longest one as 45minutes. But, despite that, the bread and the conversations with my family members made the time fly by. Other than the burgers, I also tried the lobster salad and the roasted asparagus. All of them were divine

D Bistro sits across from the MasterCard theater at the Marina Bay Sands. Great seafood, wines and selection of champagnes. Great staff as well who know their menu well and are very helpful at whatever budget range you want to dine. If you tell them the concert starts at 8pm, they focus to make sure you have a great experience and leave in time. I liked the foi gras terraine, but also the oysters selection. I will warn though that the waiters have a way of expecting a tip on top of the service charge, maybe because they have become good at procuring tips from unsuspecting Americans who value over-the-top service. In Singapore, you don't have to tip if there is already a service charge on the bill. The DB Bistro bill's tipping section is so big on the paper that you think that they do not have service charge. They do
4
Once again has a great French chef shown that you can do it all! Joanna was our waitress, excellent, fun, knowledgeable and still, with discretion. Lobster bisque, with plenty of huge pieces of lobster, duck pate, perfect, flammenküche and seatrout. We where back in Paris, again. As a chef myself, trained in Paris, this was a treat. We will be back at DB at marina sands, again. The only 2 things, change the music. Change the plate for the soup. Not attractive with a small bowl.
3
My partner and I went to DB as a part of the Show and Dine package for the musical at MBS. First of all there were very limited choices for food. I started with Curried Pumpkin Soup which had a rather odd taste. The staff was very accommodating for our request to change my boyfriend's appetizer to a salad since he's lactose intolerant. For main course, we had Tasmanian Sea Trout and Chicken and both dishes fell short for us
4
I tried for ages to get a table at Daniel's when I was in New York and never managed to, so I was excited to come here. I just walked in with no reservation and got a window table!I had the DB burger, it was delicious (and huge - the portions here are New York sized). Sure it's expensive for a burger, but - since they gave me a free amuse bouche and a free huge bowl of madelines - it was a very reasonable price for a night out at a lovely restaurant
5
We recently went with some friends and Daughter to the Theatre at MBS. On searching the Theatre ticketing web site, they offered several meal deals with several of the local restaurants at very attractive combined prices.We have found out in previous visits that you need to book pre Theatre, so this was a great idea, set meal option, and for Singapore, a bit of a cost saverChoosing DB’s was easy. I have always enjoyed the food here. High quality and I wish that I had one closer to home. I make a mental note each time I visit to go and spend a week in Lyon.So to the review....The front of house has been overhauled and brightened up. Gone is the very formal check in desk and now replaced with an oyster display. Disappointed that the Mushroom risotto was not available, but the replacement pasta option went down well.I opted for the Pumpkin soup and the Chicken Rice French style. Both sounding innocuous, but bursting with flavour and generous portions for modern french The rest of the party all enjoyed their fare. The service, ambience and overall experience will bring me back again (I can’t say that for the Sound of Music though!!
4
I went there with one of my best pals to catch up over brunch and I must say the atmosphere was there was great as usual . The burgers were yummy not forgetting the refreshing mocktails on their menu .
4
The restaurant is based in the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall. The food was excellent as was the service. Had a good ambience and was reasonably priced. Would recommend DB to anyone visiting Singapore.
5
Had a lovely dinner with my family to celebrate a birthday and the food was really good. Service was prompt and friendly too!
2
We finish in this restaurant because was too late
We had just s hamburger and we spent as we have had a lobster
I don't care to pay for a good food, but hamburger is a hamburger
Suormala

I like the seafood here, especially the fresh oysters, on decorated plates beautifully. Staff are enthusiastic, tentative and professional.
5
Last night, we have a good dinner at DB and I think everybody already know about how DB's provide very fresh meals and quality of cuisines. So, I just now would like to highlight for the person who is in charge of our table because he chose a good Red Wine "AZELIA BAROLO" for us and it is really nice to have a perfect dinner. He can suggest right matching red wine with our cuisines. The most important things to have good a dinner depends on how they serve you very well. I really appreciate to Mr. Johnny and recommended DB as one of the best fine dining in Singapore!
5
Our New Favorite Dinning Place, The ambiance and service was nothing short of amazing not only was the wait staff friendly and helpful, but went out of their way to make you feel welcome, it was that personal touch that makes it Fantastic! The best Oysters and sea-food we ever tasted, Great wine, Service was prompt, nothing short of professional. We had a Great time, love this place, we will be going back, when back in Singapor
5
Love the service and ambiance at this fantastic restaurant. The oysters are probably some of the best I have ever tasted! Props to Chef Jonathan on the perfect pasta and their GM, Andrew for taking the time to make things personal. Looking forward to going back again and again
5
I remember first eating here for my 18th birthday years ago and had a most memorable seafood platter with my grandparents and my best friend for a late lunch.Years later, I am happy to note that the seafood lived up to my expectations, given that it has been a long time since I've last visited Singapore. I also had the great tuna tartare! All paired with a Mondavi, another favourite from Napa
4
We arrived for a late lunch, on arrival we had very attentive helpful staff explaining the menu & wines. The signature seafood platter was fantastic as were the oyster choices. Suggestion: being the restaurant was nearly empty & I had ordered the platter that was served on a tower they could of moved us to a bigger table so we didn't have to manuvure our bread plate, wine & water glasses around the table. We had a long lazy lunch and noticed once the staff changed shift the service level dropped. This is not a cheap place but the food is lovely
4
Good wines by the glass.
Appreciate their consistency over the years. Our favourites are raw oysters, onion soup and steak. They have delivered consistently over the years.
5
We went here on a Saturday evening, the place was very busy with couples and families, a very nice atmosphere, staff was very friendly and accommodating, service was good and quick - the seafood selection platter is definitely recommended!
5
we had lunch at db bistro. set menus which cost 45 dollars , not really expensive - huge portions and yummy food! they have their child menu as well. staff is very attentive and quite pleasant!
5
Great food and service. Will recommend this place! The DB burger is a must try. Lobster busque was creamy and one of the best i had.
5
Celebrated my partner's birthday at db bistro. Had pre order a cake prior arriving. They served it right after we were done with our main course which was excellent as I did not have to remind them and they had the initiative to do so. Happy with that. Food and cocktails were great!
4
My husband and I ordered a mushroom crepe and the original DB burger. Both tasted good and made fresh. The fries that was served with the burger was cut thin and fried evenly. It was a good treat. My favourite item on the menu though was not the food but the mocktail Little India - which was a blend of Calamansi, Apple and Cinnamon Syrup with some mint leaves on crushed ice. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a sweet sour drink. The only downside is the drink comes in a tall wine glass which makes the drink heavy on the top making it easy to be knocked over. I recommend the drink be served in a spoutless wine glass, rock glass, whiskey glass - something sort. Staff were friendly and attended to us at a reasonable speed
5
Very nice restaurant. Great food, very good service.Came here on a recommendation from Marina Bay Sands (see separate review) and was not disappointed. The food was fantastic. We went mainly down rare road that night with Steak Tartare, Tuna Tartare and Escargot with a lovely bottle of Pinot Noir from Robert Mondavi Private Selection. All was delicious and very satisfying. They were very generous with the bread and finished off with freshly made MadelinesThe service was first class and very happy with the overall dining experience.The scores:Food - 10 out of 10 (exceptional)Service - 10 out of 10 (excellent attention to detail)Ambience - 10 out of 10 (very well set out. Not too noisy, the right amount of lighting.)Value for Money - 10 out of 10 (high class restaurant with high class prices but you get what you pay for) Overall Score - 10 out of 1

We had booked a table for 2 at DB Bistro while we visiting the Crazy Horse show at the MBS and also to celebrate our wedding anniversary. As we are going to the MBS Theater, we choose our food from the Pre Theater & Market Specials...where we decided to go for 3 courses Menu Bouchon but for the starters we selected from the Market Specials...the famous New England Clam Chowder...The waitress confirmed that there will be a surcharged...on top of the 3 courses price as we are not selecting the starter from the Menu Bouchon. Oh well...it is our wedding anniversary dinner... so we decided to go ahead and ordered our main course: Tasmanian Sea Trout for my wife and Red Wind Braised Chicken "Coq Au Vin" for myself....The Service was fine and quick as we ordered our food from the Pre Theater Menu..where:The Clam Chowder was served in a too small bowl and full with potatoes, salted dried bacon and thus less soup. The taste is good but the soup became very very salty! A New England Clam Chowder should be served in a normal bowl where you can see the potatoes and bacons are swimming under the nice chowder...The Main course was served right afterwards but again it was terrible SALTY!!!and really very disappointing!!!....The Fish was fine but the vegetables were so salty (bacon) that you can't even taste the sweet corn while my dish "Coq Au Vin" was soooo salty that I can only eat the (baked) chicken without the gravy. The braised chicken in Red Wine was completely soak in the gravy, thus too salty to eat.Dessert was ok nothing special (Chestnut Cassis Gateaux and Duo of Artisanal Cheeses)...had better one...while coffee was served a bit too cold....Naturally we gave our feedback immediately to one of the serving staffs.But.... All and all, It is very disappointing night for our expensive wedding anniversary dinner (with a surcharge!!) at DB Bistro and have had much better food in a less established restaurants
5
This restaurant is great , I am sure lots of restaurants in Singapore are great but this one stands out , Mostly western food such as Coq au vin , but why shouldnâ€™t Asia have a mixture of the western food and all of Asian cuisine The service exceed where I have eaten around the world before , well done
4
If you are a burgerophile (am definite it's not a word), then Singapore can be a bit frustrating - not that it doesn't have lots of good burger places, but except for a handful, they all have uniformly missed out on the "wow" factor.DB bistro is of course an up-scale joint, and by nature the ingredients used are more fresher and better. But, here the craft is also at full show.They have quite a good spread of burgers to choose from be that the classic "minimalist" ones to the gaudy foie gras loaded ones - all of them uniformly juicy and tasteful. It's of course, a very rich tasting and high calorific value dish, but once in a while if you want to splurge out on some good burgers and make it an experience (the ambiance of the restaurant definitely helps) - this is the place for you. It's good for casual dates (i wont go so far as to call the place romantic), friends, family and large groups
5
It was highly recommended by concierge at hotel and we booked table through them. Food was nice and so was service, we tried Steak & Fish dishes and they were really of high quality and flavorsome.

DB came highly recommended and we were excited about the experience. We were a group of 3 adults and 2 children.Upon arrival we were sorted in a nice booth and were ready for a great experience. The menu came and the promise of great food in the horizon added to the excitement. Staff was attentive at that point. We opted for the express lunch. The waiter kept asking if we would like to order any alcohol or the signature drinks which we declined and had opted for warm water. That's when the service started going down hill.As promised the food was great. Every dish tasted good.But our experience was marred by 3 big service quality issues :1. The table was not cleared and cleaned after each course2. We asked the waiters to help us take a group photo but they were reluctant and started pushing to each other, but they finally did3. The MAJOR service quality issue was, I asked the waiter for a clean knife to eat my croque madame. The manager came over and asked if he could help and I said yes, I would like another knife, which he then sarcastically points to my used knife that was given for my bread earlier and says but if I want a second knife he would get it.I felt insulted and embarrassed with the treatment that me and my family received. It felt as though we did not deserve to have a decent level of service just because we had ordered the set menu without anything extra. I would only recommend this place to anyone who is willing to spend on both food and drinks; or are able to accept sub standard service to enjoy the good food
5
I've enjoyed the DB Bistro, Singapore a few times now; from business lunches, pre-theater drinks and a romantic night out. Time to let people know. Apart from the friendly, attentive service, the food and drinks are consistently excellent. I don't often use the work "excellent" associated with drinks, but try the Bloody Mary. Rather than spoil the surprise, let's just say it's one-of-a-kind excellent. The oysters are fresh, the fresh fish selection varies all the time and it is beautiful prepared. The burgers have good, unique flavor that comes from using the best meats, which becomes more clear if you try the tartare. When the food, service and atmosphere are consistently good, you know you're on to a good thing

I've been to two restaurants by Daniel Boulud one in London and the other in Las Vegas. DB bistro in Singapore didn't disappoint. It is a quaint spot in MBS for French bistro meal fix. My lobster bique was small but very tasty. Steak tartare was divine, prepared tableside. Next time when I'm in Singapore, I ll definitely go back again.

Step in with a welcoming face by the service staff and give us a warm feeling. The staffs are attentive..and always be there for you when you need them..which is good!The menu wise, as the name of the restaurant, most of them are seafoods..is a great place for seafood lover like me. Yet I'm can't take beef due to my religion. But there's no other choices besides seafood and beef. So if you are not a person that love seafood and beef, this is not a suitable dining restaurant.But definitely, the food was yummy and the seafoods are fresh..especially the oyster. The dessert is special as well. Enjoyed our dinner here.

Travelling with 3 teenagers has its challenges!Singapore thankfully has plenty to offer to keep the Kevin and Perry wannabes entertained enough.We spent two weeks sampling lots of different restaurants and eateries in Singapore, but DB Bistro was the only place we went back to and was the place of choice for our 'last supper' before we headed back to the UK!This left us all with happy memories of an incredible country.The choice of food and wines available was extensive and the staff were extremely helpful and made the overall experience thoroughly enjoyable. As a business owner the kind of venue take important clients to when 'sealing a deal' and as a dad the place I returned to ensuring my entire family were kept happy, whilst I had one of the best meals I've had in a long time
5
We were at the shops/mall at Marina Bay Sands and popped in here for a light lunchtime bite.Choice of three oysters including French variety.Sat at the bar and had great service. Lovely choice of wines and champagnes.Nice ambience. Lovely relaxing oyster lunch (we had two kinds) with a glass of wine and champagne
4
Big and pleasant place with very funny and nice staff. I was absolutely satisfied with the service and the food also. They were also very helpful with takeaway food. The bathroom is flawless. The price is the best, because my colleague paid the bill.:
4
Many places to choose from at Sands Bay Marina but weren't disappointed with our choice. Enjoyed Onion Soup (delicious!) Sea Bass and Chicken Coq Au Vin. Fish was cooked to perfection and great flavors. Nice welcome bread basket on arrival. Staff attentive, couldn't fault anything. Very extensive wine list, impressive being we love our wines.
4
From the shellfish, super fresh oysters and glorious caviar till the signature dishes such as the lobster and saffron pasta, DB bistro modern is a must taste when in MBS.
The Parisian bistrot atmosphere is very pleasant, and the staff usually super attentive and charming.
4
This place serves the freshest oysters! Also the salmon is a must try! Good wine selections and friendly servers, prices are on the high side, but food will compensate for the price.
4
We all enjoyed ourselves. Food was good as was the service. They even gave some complimentary madelines to the b'day boy.
3
the salad was too salty, the signature Burger doesnt worth it, oyster also. average only, can try but only for one
4
Luv the durian souffle. Service is excellent. Staff is well trained. But burger is a tad too salty. Reasonable price
5
I must thank the wine waiter and sommelier for saving my butt. I managed to choose the worst wine I've ever tasted. I ordered what I thought was a Sauvignon blanc, but was actually a Savagnin blanc, an uncommon varietal that tasted very much like formaldehyde. After opening two bottles they decided that it was so bad that they wouldn't charge me for it! Thank you so much!But for the food, it was fantastic. I stayed away from the burger and modern foods and went with a traditional Onion Soup and Bouillabaisse. Now I'm not a huge seafood fan, but the flavor from the bouillabaisse was amazing. I wish I had access to the bistro food like this near my home
5
The missus and I have eaten here a few times, usually before we head to the theatre opposite. It never fails to disappoint. Superb service. We almost always sit at the bar where the team are friendly, professional and entertaining. I'm often slapping venues on TripAdvisor for not delivering value, but while DBBistro is at the thick end of your wallet, its worth every penny. The seafood is standout. If you're able to get here for an oyster happy hour 3-6pm, do it. Great deal on beers and oyster that shouldn't be missed.Bistro classics are given an indulgent twist and I recommend the salads, which are large, and the fish dishes, all I've tried have been great, and they're beautifully served at the table. A great venue in MBS where you can often feel spoilt for choice.

Went there for family meal. Burgers looked reasonable at $32. salad Nicoise at $28....did not realise all the add-ons were coming.Food was ok.Major horror at final bill. $400...5 people...no starters, no dessert, no wineJust had few dinner drinks, 2xgin tonic, apple juice, 2 lager and a $30 cocktail.Elected not to have wine...cheapest bottle $90, so went for plain tap water...free? No, $10 a bottle...Have no problem forking out for a good meal...but this place takes celebrity chef over charging to a new level

We went to celebrate birthday and opted for chef's tasting menu during dinner. DB burger may be its specialty but I have sort of hang for tasting menus. The courses were definitely filling and varied. The entree of oyster, fresh and just opened, were the best. Seldom do I get to taste so smooth oysters. Crab cakes were interesting and so were lobsters and finally the steak which if I recall, was ribeye. Overall for the price it is offered, DB is good. Ambience is nice though it remains crowded mostly. For the special occasion they offered a complimentary dessert which was cherry on the top
5
Right from the beginning, the experience was seamless. From making a last minute reservation online for 5 people, to being attended to straightaway, dinner was exceptional. They were able to cater for our dietary needs of gluten-free options, even bringing out some gluten-free bread at the start. Attention was on point, but not overbearing. Friendly waiter, and food came out quickly. Highly recommended
5
I'm glad that they have the authentic French onion soup that's w cheese on top of the soup. Oysters are really fresh n taste good on its own. Vege burgers are good for sharing! The entire place is great for dining alone to family gathering.
5
Great service, friendly staff, always a good selection of oysters, nice wine list and among the best steaks in Singapore. What more could a boy want?
Maybe a better view
But otherwise outstanding. Everything a bustro should be
4
On Friday night, it was very busy and difficult to get attention from service staff. Once you got the attention, all went well with excellent food standard and menu varieties.Our lady service staff was efficient and friendly however, we noticed that not all of them have this standard though.Overall, delightful experience and we shall return
5
To be honest, my husband and i never stay hours in a restaurant. We intend to eat fast. At times we left much earlier than the diners who came before us. At DB Bistro & Oyster Bar we just enjoyed ourselves there cause the food there was yumilicious. My husband is not a huge fan of oysters so i ordered half dozen for myself but when my oysters came, my hubby tried 1 and he said the oyster he had was nice. We ordered another half dozen:) For the main i had lobster bisque OMG!!! It tasted so delicious! I love it! My husband had burger and he enjoyed it too. The Raspberry lemonade is a must to try, i had 2 round of that refreshing lemonade. I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will be back whenever i'm in Singapore:) Go and dine there:)

DB Bistro by Chef Danial Boulud is located in the Mall (The Shoppes) at the Marina Bay Sands on the Galleria Level amongst the shops. We had none of the issues some other reviewers are reporting - service was good, not overbearing but attentive. Food was excellent as I will detail before and the drinks fine. Would highly recommend dining here.Started with Onion Soup and Chop Salad which were done very well - hot soup, with the right mix of cheese and bread and a great broth. Next, had the Seabass and the Duck Confit which were delicious. The Seabass was cooked perfectly - juicy, flaky, The Duck Confit was wonderful - tender and tasty.Finished with the Baked Alaska which was a nice touch.Overall, a wonderful dinner and experience. Highly recommend it

Our waiter was very attentive, something I really appreciate living in Singapore. He tried to accommodate a simple request to swap out the iceberg lettuce for some spinach in my tuna Niçoise salad. Alas, we compromised with arugula - a healthier choice than iceberg. That was my first surprise of the evening. A $$$$ restaurant should do better. Next up was the Mediterranean Sea Bass; I should have stuck with the steaks and burgers. The puny sliver of a fillet lacked substance, taste, and left me wanting. If value for your money is important, this isn't the place for you.
5
We ate at DB Bistro with the intent of determining if they served the best burger in Singapore. The unanimous verdict amount the ten members of our party was an emphatic "YES". In fact, they might have the best burger in all of Asia. The fries were another grand revelation. Perfect in every way. We can't wait to return
5
We ate here after going to spago and being told it was full . We had drinks at spago lounge but the service was terrible so we left to find somewhere better to eat.The service here was first class from the moment we arrived. The restaurant is nicely built design with booths and large bar in the centre.We were served by several different staff and all were fully charming and helpful.We had Alaska crab and smoked salmon starter and mains of the medium seafood platter. Everything tasted great and fresh and the amount we ate was just about perfect.The cost was slightly expensive for what we had but we didn't mind as the service and food was so good.Very nice place which seems popular and would return anytime
4
Popped in on the off chance of enjoying a late lunch. Found staff very accommodating and knowledgeable. The steak was done to absolute perfection, but the soufflé was wonderful although be prepared to wait as they are made to order. Very nice selection of wine, would return next time in Singapore.
5
It's one of the best burgers I had ever had. Everything is just perfect. From the fries to the pickles and the beef is so so good. Best to also book a table and try to get the booth seats. The restaurant is somewhat not easy to spot. There are some canvas that reads "French Bristro" and the "DB" word is somewhat hard to spot from afar. When you are in the mall go towards the "Mastercard Theater's" direction. It's right across there
5
Fluffy n not overpowering. Staff r really courteous n well trained. Extensive drinks selection. Nice ambience.
1
We were looking for good food but such a deception for the burgers and the pasta.
The service itself is also not good, the waiters are just trying to make you order but barely knows the menu.
I will not come back ever.
5
Definitely best onion soup in my restaurant memories.
Staffs are super kind and nice.
Main dishes also more than expectation.
The nice traditional way of food + adding up a fusion items = Super!!
4
We opted to go hear following a disappointing experience at steakhouse. Excellent steak. Great service. Great cocktails. Ended up visiting twice within a week.
5
Came here for the fresh oysters and lobsters and was very pleased with the quality. And the wait staff were very friendly and efficient. Good place for lunch and dinner.

Been here twice, way over priced, food just mediocre, service not great, not bad but not the kind you expect for prices like this. Pizza and bread street kitchen much better options

I was there last night with my husband to celebrate my birthday, thinking that this would be a good choice after hearing some good review about the burgers.However my first experience there was plain disappointing.Firstly, when i asked the waitress politely if she could recommended a few dishes, her reply was, "Oh madam, actually if you were to ask me, everything is good but it is up to you what your preference is". I was taken aback by her answer especially for such a high standard restaurant, i would expect a better answer. Next i asked her if it was possible not to add cognac to the lobster bisque, before i could explain why, she replied with a very rude NO YOU CANNOT. Mind you, i asked because i am expecting.Secondly, when my husband requested to change his fish to a burger instead for the main course, the waitress asked him if i was still keeping my same order.. she asked this 4 or 5 times despite me replying yes and without looking at me, like i was invisible. I replied with a "YES i am having my spaghetti nero please". After which i was taken aback with her very rude answer. She raised her voice and said WELL I AM JUST CHECKING while glaring at us. First of all, you do not need to check with my husband about my choice, secondly, ask the one who ordered the dish and thirdly, this is not the way to treat a customer. Throughout the night, water was not topped up, she did not attende to my husband when he wanted to order wine, faced her back to us while we politely asked her for help. We were seated next to the counter and i had to reach out several times to top my my own warm water.Worse part was, when the food was served, it was HORRIBLE and very disappointing. Overall, the bad service, bad tasting food and expensive bill was a turn off.We came in as happy people smiling from ear to ear ready to celebrate my birthday and walked out as unhappy and disappointed customers.You really need to consider re training or hiring better staff as some of them, like the lady who served us definitely looked like she was unhappy with her job and too aggressive and rude to be serving in such a restaurant.I would not recommend this place to anyone and definitely will strike this place off my list of to go places to dine in Singapore
4
I've been here quite a few times for lunch (usually pretty quiet at this hour), and it doesn't ever disappoint. The food is always on point and the service attentive. They will always ask about dietary restrictions when you order, so anyone with gluten issues, fear not! I love the steak tartare, bloody mary, patÃ© and of course, their oysters
5
Marina Bay Sands will offer you a lot of options... This is one that you may not want to miss. The shopping centre ambiance could be misleading.... Great seafood platter - order the Grand for two. The wine list is pricey but they are quality wines on the list. Excellent and un-intrusive service, sizing the order to suit your need rather than ramping up the bill, nice background music, comfortable interior design. We have enjoyed it....
4
I stopped in here for lunch during a trade show at the Expo and this place delivered. The kale salad / club sandwich combination was delicious. The service was top notch and the atmosphere was pleasant and quiet - a nice escape from the crazy of the mall and expo
4
Went on a Saturday night, it was crowded. Ordered the foods and :
Fresh oysters, tender fillet mignon, nice trout ;))
5
This was the second time I dined at this fine restaurant. It proved that the quality of food and service was consistently good. My favorite is the seafood platter which beautifully arranged and the seafood was really delicious and fresh.
5
We treated us to a sublime dinner where the manager and chef worked together to provide a superb red snapper dinner. And the matching wine was just right. The price was absulutely reasonable taken the quality in consideration. Will definately do this again.
4
Pleasantly surprised with delicious good sized servings ... best of all, there's umami in the meat of our piggy burger. Service was generally attentive as we were early and the place was not full house yet. Love it! Will definitely go again !
5
Grabbing a relaxing girls' lunch on a weekday and of course we chose DB. Sadly the set lunch offering has gotten very limited and unappealing, so we ordered a la cart to go with cocktails and vino. Overall decent experience~
4
Had dinner at DB Bistro while visiting the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. As it was a weekend I tried their special set menu. First course was a salad nicoise which was decent though not outstanding. Next was the trout which was tasty and well executed. I finished the meal with a rhubarb tart which was a pleasant ending to the meal. What I appreciated though was the warm service of the staff who were attentive despite running a tight ship. My only gripe was the overpriced wine list.
5
This was such a treat for us & so reasonably priced in very expensive Singapore. We'd visited the Skypark Deck at the adjacent Marina Bay Sands Hotel but didn't want to pay hotel prices for dinner, so we wandered into the 'Shoppes' area to find a good restaurant.We had a mooch around looking at menus at the many restaurants here & finally decided we'd go for this charming French bistro. We went for the set price menu from which we didn't struggle at all to find something we liked, even though the choices were fairly limited. Our mushroom soup starter was absolutely delicious - something both my friend & I thoroughly enjoyed. We were given complimentary bread & butter & our waiter was very attentive, refilling our glasses of complimentary water whenever he saw them depleting. The ambience, food, service & price were all excellent - thank you very much!All in all, we would definitely recommend & will revisit when we next find ourselves in lovely Singapore
5
I visited this restaurant as I had fond memories of Daniels in New York last year. I had to have their white Cosmopolitan cocktail again. My husband and son tried two of the burgers and rated them as some of the best they have tried ( and they have tried many
4
Wonderful lunch with my brother Phil, visiting over the Easter weekend for the world rugby 7sAfter weekend at the national stadium eating terrible stadium food we needed a really nice meal, to replenish Singapore's reputation as a culinary centre.We did a gardens by the bay walk in the morning visited the domes and then meandered into the MBS shopping centre.We decided on the set lunch menu and the food was really delicious fresh served hot tin the plate, tasty everything you would expect from a great restaurant.Great service, clean bathrooms and we both look forward to our next visi
5
Been here quite a few times and enjoyed every time I visited. I tried the DB burger every time as that's what I crave before I came. Tried it's roast chicken for 2 as well. Tender and tasteful. Nice mix with vege and mushrooms. The bread selection before the meal is well appreciated. Another cool point: it has its own private washroom, instead of needing to use the public washroom from MBS. Clean and well appointed.Service is apt and warm. Gives good suggestions and always willing to serve. Thanks!
4
Its nice chilling place for foods and drinks. It took us so long to finish the foods as it served in great portion.
Loved their mocktail and you can consider of having raspberry mocktail if you prefer sour drinks but not too over
5
Tried their special DB burger which had Wagyu sirloin and foie gras added to the burger. Heavenly! This place is consistently good.
2
Though the marquee and the celebrity chef say bistro - the size, decor, music, and food are reminiscent of Houlihan's or Bennigan's during their 80s heyday. Our table tried the following hackneyed dishes: shrimp cocktail, burger, ribeye with frites, and a house chop salad. The shrimp cocktail was good. As for the rest of our dinner, we could've saved a couple of hundred dollars and purchased an equine salt lick instead.We ended up at DB Bistro b/c there was no room at CUT. Don't end up at DB's
1
Was here to celebrate an anniversary with my partner. I've been here a few times a couple of years(3-4 years) back and had relatively good experiences. My partner has never been so I thought DB would be a good idea. Boy was I wrong. First, the service. Terrible terrible service. The lady attending to our table seems like she hated her job. Her attitude is horrible and sometimes downright rude. She slams things on our tables, looks at us from the corner of her eyes when we talk to her and when we calls for her attention when she walks past our table, she continues walking and asks us what we want with her back turned WHILE serving the table beside us. Like we don't deserve even a second of her time. Our water was not topped up and the manager who happened to walk past saw it and filled it for us. And when we we're paying the bill, she didn't ask if we were ready before snatching it away from our table with the credit card. The service really left much to be desired and we found ourselves reminiscing the times we dined at CUT, the restaurant opposite DB. The service standards are really worlds apart. DB servers really could take some much needed lessons from Cut. Secondly, the food. We had the DB burger with the foie gras in the patty. I had it years ago and it was memorable. But this time, it was dry as anything and barely tasted the foie gras. I was digging in the patty looking for it and there was only one tiny piece. My partner said this burger made him crave for McDonald's. The only saving grace for this dish is the fries. We also ordered the crab tagliolini which was underwhelming. The crab was not fresh and there was an overpowering sour taste that spoilt the dish. The manager offered to change it to something else and we went for the mussels. I'm not sure if it has to do with the season, but the mussels were small and honestly, there was nothing to shout. I actually thought I have had much better ones in other less established restaurants. At this point of time my partner and I were so disappointed with the meal that we were discussing if we should just skip dessert and have it at somewhere else. However they had durian soufflé on the menu and as a feverish fan of durian, I had to try it. Thank goodness we did. It was the only redeeming point of the whole meal. It was creamy, flavorful and incredibly dreamy and light. We both loved it. We will definitely be back for dessert but sadly we can't say the same about the food.
2
AS this bistro is in the mall, dress code is non-existent. Music was loud and not appropriate for bistro dining. Appetizers were very good (mushroom soup & pate de fois gras) Main course was ok, White pepper used on Salmon skin rather than black pepper. Coq au vin a bit stew-like with no veggies. Extra French fries were disappointing. White wine was fine. Red wine was warm (probably 3 Degrees too warm). Service was quick, almost rushing. It was more enjoyable leaving than arriving. All this for over $250, awful
4
Drinks and oysters at the bar. BTW they have a great happy hour deal is you are around between 3-6. Dinner was a table divided. The guys had burgers and beer and us ladies did the set menu. The burgers and beer were a hit. However, the highlight of the meal was my meal. I started with the kale Ceasar salad. I enjoyed the salad, but I thought there might have been too many nuts. I can not have dairy and the staff and kitchen went out of their way to accommodate me. I had the trout with peas and ham (without the lemon butter sauce) instead I had a grilled lemon and some olive oil with extra FRESH peas. It was fantastic. My friend had the same dish, but as it comes and she enjoyed hers as well. Our service was fantastic from start to end. There are a lot of places in Singapore to eat, but not many I say I will go back to again
4
A great place to have lunch at a bistro owned by Daniel Boulder,a Michelin star chef of " Daniel" in Manhattan.Comfortable seating, prompt and courteous service combined with good, wholesome tasty food.The burger ordered was very tasty and the slow cooked pork belly with lentils and Savoy cabbage very good. A good choice of beers was available, as well as wines and spirits.Although set inside a shopping mall, the atmosphere is upmarket.Worth the money
3
Once you get over eating in a shopping mall this is not a bad place.A fairly standard French bistro menu is quite pricey and the food is reasonably executed.Their idea of Bouillabaisse is risible and they really should take it off their menu.That said the Plateau de Fruits de Mer was ok with superb Cape Cod oysters aplenty but tasteless prawns and lobster rather taking the gloss of a well presented dish.Wines are fairly priced for Singapore and service was attentive and efficient despite a full restaurant.This is a place you feel could raise its game in the kitchen a notch or two to make it quite special.At the moment it is all just a bit disappointing
5
My wife and I enjoyed a beautiful lunch here during March. The French bistro style fit out was a perfect setting for lunch and then menu offered some classic French inspired dishes. First we shared tasting boards of pâté and meats with beautiful warm bread (gluten free bread prepared for my wife) with pickles and radish. We ordered a bottle of rose from Provence which was perfectly light and crisp.My wife then enjoyed a fresh jumbo prawn cocktail and I had a New York strip steak and frittes with bernaise sauce.The whole meal was delicious and we sat for the afternoon enjoying the wine and great atmosphere. The restaurant is inside the shopping mall at Marina Bay Sands
5
DB is an excellent restaurant to go with a bunch of friends who all have different likings. Seafood and oyster platters, excellent burgers, salads (especially the chopped salad), great steaks and the classic french dishes (coq au vin, veal blanquette, steak tartare,...) good affordable wine selection by the glass, great music and excellent desserts (make sure you try the madeleines
3
While the ambience was great, limited menu for vegetarians. Not many chicken dishes either. The vegetarian burger wasn't that good. Oysters were great! Would be great if they include more veg and chicken burgers!
3
Typical bistrot, nothing exceptional from Daniel Boulud. Food was good and service was great !!! It needs more personality and signature menu from DB, all they had was the DB burger, the signature dish is a burger? In a french bistrot??? No..
4
Resterant are good in general good service i had the rib steak mid-will it was really good need to get more portion for starters there was few options but so far i rate it 6/10
5
I tend to view celebrity chef restaurants with cynicism. Many times the food is good, but overpriced thanks to the celebrity named tagged onto it. This chic, exclusive bistro is no different -- but the food was indeed excellent, and the wine equally as good. In this rare instance, the hefty price tag is worth it. I ordered the slow-cooked pork belly with lentils and was completely blown away when my knife barely touched the pork and it slid right through. The pork was tender, perfectly cooked and the fat melted in my mouth. It was slightly on the over-salted side, but the Pinot Noir we had with the meal was incredible with it. Despite the modest portions, the food was rich and surprisingly filling. For dessert, we had a chocolate and salted caramel lava cake (good, but nothing to shout about) and warm madeleines (buttery, warm, not overly sweet, light, fluffy with a hint of citrus -- perfect). Kudos also to the staff, who were attentive, courteous and polite. Overall, I would say that this is the perfect place to impress a date or for a special occasion with a loved one and family
3
We ate here on our first night in town having spent some time lookin at all the shops in the Merina Day Delevopment. This looked like it would be good for a casual evening MealOrdered French Onion soup - brilliant, my partner went for shrimp cocktail - which at best was disappointing with the sauce overpowering the rest of the dish for mains lobster salad for us oth this was good Service was very goodHe bill was higher than expected and I do not think that the food supported the pric
5
Ambiance: Chill, no dress code required (We were just walking around in flip flops and shorts and decided to eat there, luckily, there's no dress code required)Must-try: Rib Eye Steak (Medium), Wild Mushroom, Mushroom SoupOthers: Their Petit Filet Mignon (from the name itself is small but the portion is just right for ladies on a diet hahaha)Value for Money: 5 stars!Service: Fast and all our orders arrived perfectl

We had an evening at DB last Sunday night, ordered a plate of oysters and the mussels.Oysters came very fresh but mussels arrived smelling real strong of ammonia. Both me and my bf were surprised at first but just wanted to be sure so I tried one and so did he. It was positively bad for me and he too spat out the one and only piece he had.We spoke to the barman since we sat at the bar. And after some time a manager came along to offer us other items and perform service recovery.She said to us that because the source of the mussels might differ from what we're used to that sometimes customers can't accept it.Don't know if they actually smelled it or tasted it. If they did then something is very wrong to be so ignorant.But the evening got better, the manager(I assume) who did service recovery tried to offer us other food but the both of us honestly just wanted mussels since we're going from place to place and trying out mussels. In fact we had earlier during the evening had mussels at pizzeria mozza next door. Never the less, she gave us a complimentary snack bowl of mini Madeleines. Which were admittedly good.Then along came a Caucasian man who came over to insist that their mussels were fresh as they receive deliveries 6 times a week and said that maybe their chef likes garlic very much which lead to the foul smell. (I love garlic and garlic does not smell like that at all). In my opinion the way he say it seem like he was hinting that we were lying.I felt very offended as this would mean that we don't know what fresh mussels taste like and left very upset
5
We know the manager, Andrew Burns from CafÃ© Baloud in Palm Beach. He ran that fine dining restaurant beautifully and is doing the same, from what we experienced in Singapore. He recommended the hamburgers which turned out to be wonderful. My wife started with a selection of oysters. I had a perfect shrimp salad. Great lunch experience in an attractive setting
3
The restaurant is good, some staff are very patience and nice, others seems they hate people! The guy that order my food showed me a face of disappoint cause I just wanted a 3 course with soup,salad and a dessert! I order a wine, it was very good. This soup was very strong, it was my first try,maybe that's why I didn't fell better. I would back , choosing other food!
5
I celebrated my friend's birthday there and we were impressed by the food! It was simply heavenly, worth definitely the Michelin stars that its awarded. Our waitress was really attentive and hospitable. They also accommodated my request for a special decoration on my friend's birthday dessert. We will definitely visit this place again. Thanks for making this day a special day for us.
4
A place to host my guest and customers. Nice ambience with good range of food and wine choices. We had a good time there indeed
4
I love this place! Service is excellent, interior decor was very good. Overall would dine here again, value for money.
3
Rib eye saulty and fries cold. Service just so so. Next time I shall remind them to cook w less salt.
4
The food and service here are great. We eat there a couple of times a month and are never disappointed
5
A very nice french bistro. But along with his neighbours, the location was pretty weird to me: inside a mall. However, because of this, this restaurant was packed once the theatre (that time was playing Chicago) finished the 6 pm show. We were one of the crowd finished from the Chicago Musical. Immediately went to this place, without reservation, we couldn't get a seat right away. But 1 gentleman, i think the manager or somelier, was very nice and found us a seat not long after. My husband and I had each 1 starter and 1 main. For me, they had all my fave: foie gras as starter, and black truffle risotto as main. The portion was rather big and filling. I love the liveliness of this place and how all the staff were attentive. And of course the quality and taste of the food. Without this it wont be a successful place as it is now. We will come back to this place :)

We went there for a show menu for Air Supply on Saturday 4 March. There wasn't much to choose from the set menu for a show. I ordered the Apple Cider Braised Organic Chicken. It was dry and the taste made it inedible. I also didn't look appetising, all thrown into a small metal bowl. I ate a portion only when mixed with a piece of bacon and left 3/4 of it. No-one bothered to ask if everything was fine (which the much cheaper restaurants do). The drinks are absolutely expensive (but so is everywhere else in Singapore). $18 for a beer. Don't even bother thinking about wine. When we sat down we were offered sparkling or still water. Being in Singapore, I assumed that the still was what you would drink instead of tap water (we weren't offered tap water so the assumption remained). After dinner we were charged $8 for Fiji Water. They did refund that after I mentioned it. However, the terrible food was enough to give this place a poor rating and a wide birth if I come back to Singapore
3
Was expected good quality and well prepared food, and great service under Daniel Boulud banner. Ordered the fish cake but had to return to kitchen. The side dish slaw was so salty that it is bitter & inedible. Had the signature burger. It was good. Fries was crispy. Dessert not many choice for my taste, too basic even for a bistro. Overall the meal is so-so. It's my wife birthday. At reservation, hostess offered to write the '"Happy Birthday" on the dessert plate. Not happened. Also did not offer free car park coupon until I found out from the mall info desk. All in all average food and below standard service. Need attention for such a restaurant.

Reynaldo and staff have looked after us so well on our three visits in 24hrs to this restaurant. The cheaper oyster option from 3-6pm is unmissable. The oysters are divine. When a place this good has unpretentious staff and good food it's an experience you can't afford to miss. All staff at this hotel have been excellent. Nothing is cheap, but everything is worth it. Now to visit again

We ate there last Saturday for my mother-in-law's birthday. Everything was really good. We especially enjoyed the seafood platter : so fresh and well prepared ! The service is good, helpful and pleasant. The only negative thing that I would mention is the sound level of music (too loud) and the choice of songs : welcome to the 80's ... (Tear for Fears, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran ...). A little bit weir

I've been to this place many times in last few years and every time my impression remains the same - nothing so fancy, but good steaks and excellent service. The steaks are good and much cheaper compare to the celebrity Cuts, which is very nearby. The place is also famous for oysters, but never tried it here, so cannot say much. Good fit for business meetings.
5
Good service, amazing oysters and a very charming manager. The blond bold one. He was so kind and informative. It added so much into our experience in Singapore. All his recommendations were fantastic! Thank you so much.

Loved the seafood platter. Lobster, oysters and mussels were fresh! Desserts were great too, espcially the baked alaska!
4
Great and attentive service. Food was good. Great ambience. Would be nicer if the table for two was a little bigger and not wobbly.
5
excellent burger and slow cook salmon. food is fast and service is good. good ambience for late night drinks
4
Enjoyable lunch of lobster salad, though the lobster wasn't as flavoursome as I'd hoped from a DB restaurant. Service was excellent and friendly, as a solo diner I felt welcome. Had a tasty dessert of molten chocolate cake and was given free warm Madeleines as well, so pleasantly full.
5
This restaurant is located just across the Master Card Theater at MBS. Very convenient place while waiting for the theater to open the door and let you in for the show. I had a good fresh oysters and other food and soup. All very delicious. Price wise this restaurant is not cheap but worth the quality. Service also good

Some Restaurants can be intimating to enter. Not DB Bistro though. With their friendly staff and casual layout , Db Bistro is a good place to go for for good food, drinks and to have a good evening with. From what i can see, they are mostly available for booking (better to call and make reservations though) and is easy to get a table at. Their Oysters were awesome, fresh and the taste not something to be forgotten. I on a personal note, love their freshly baked Madeleine every-time which is a must try. Do have an opportunity to go by. I am sure that you will love it as well

I tried hard to get some attention to order a bottle of champagne for my birthday dinner. By the time the first course arrived they were unable to take my order for a bottle of champagne ! Sigh...I got my bottle of Champagne only after the end of my first course.Next roasted chicken main course arrived it was very salty. When we complained the server thanked us for our feedback and they will relay it back to the chef. As she was talking she told us there was thee chef. He, of course, never even bothered to come to apologise. Anyway as the server says they will make sure this doe snoit happen again. I am glad the other diners will enjoy the fruits of my complaints. But absolutely no recovery of any sort.Ont he way out I noted that half the restaurant was kept closed. So even with half the restaurant open they don't have staff to take a $300 bottle order of champagne.Isugegst others eat the burgers it cannot go wrong. Great ambience though
5
me n the mrs were here on V-Day, the place was packed! but we managed to get our seats in 10mins. they have a Valentine's Day Special menu, 4 course meal..lovely selections but it was too much food for the two of us. so we end up doing the ala-carte. ordered the Petit Fillet Mignon,perfect size (170g). then ordered the escargot,yummy! plus 1/2 dozen oyesters. all of these, served by a petit dude named Bernard. he was super friendly, helpful n really took care of us. if u guys come here n got his as ur server, u will be in good hands!!
3
Food was great but I have a bad experience from the service. Arrogant French waiter with sarcastic jokes. When asked whether I can order he replied "what else am I here for? It's not to say hi". When choosing the wine he tried to pressure us into taking a more expensive one. Upon taking the cheaper one he made sure to highlight to me and my wife that it's lower quality but still Ok to drink. Another more junior waiter eventually took care of us and it was much better.
5
We had burgers and they were great. Plus the attention is very nice. Great ambient as well. Definitely try this one out
5
great service, brilliant cocktails and good value wine list and top food. dollar for dollar the best restaurant in Singapore. don't be put off as its in a shopping centre either.
5
What a great experience staff food drinks all amazing would certainly recommend it. Was a little pricey but would be back in a heartbeat.
4
Great food, value for money. Attentive service from the staff and Good atmosphere as well. Recommended
3
Think the only thing worth mentioning is its mini madeleines. Soft, fluffy and fragrant. Would be back for more.
4
good seafood platters, nice presentation, the products were OK, freshy, and oysters were OK. atmosphere is like "brasserie", it's nice having diner in this restaurant.
4
At last a good "European" restaurant. Service excellent and Anne Marie cava superb.i had a Caesar salad, perfect.
Would definitely recommend. A little pricy but then all, except the excellent stalls are.

Another celebrity restaurant at the MBS, and this is by none other than Daniel Boulud, the French chef thatâ€™s like a rock star. The restaurant has a posh Art Deco style interior and serves a mean sample of seafood dishes, and also the DB Burger. The highlight of course is their oysters and tonnes of seafood but they also have plenty of other offerings too. If you go for lunch, they offer a lunch set that is surprisingly affordable, just SGD32 for a two course which is pretty decent
1
Went in for a family lunch . We have a pregnant women and a fat guy . Asked for a table as it is quite hard to sit in a booth . The service staff actually said no . Throughout the whole meal until we left the table was vacant . Don't understand why would a restaurant at this level and location would decline a customer request which is not u reasonable. Cannot take cheese ask them if i can have the original db burger without the cheese bun the waiter also said no . Until i said that i cannot take it due to dietary issues only then they agreed to change the bun to another bun . The food is okay only . Yes they did check once in awhile but its unless already . Its like they want to be there but not willing to go the extra mile . So be prepared . If u want to dine here don't expect too much as the name bistro says it all . Its just a bistro .

This Singapore version of Daniel Boulud's classic French Bistro on 44th Street in NYC presents an excellent array of his classic dishes, as well as indulgent fruits de mer platters. The service is pleasant and attentive and the quality of the food superb. The wine list and selection of wines by the glass are also great. The only mild disappointment is the epic foie gras and short-ribbed stuffed burger which, while good, did not quite live up to the succulent indulgence of the New York original. Also, the frites were soggy and less satisfying. But overall, this is a fine restaurant that deserves its place in the pantheon of great local dining
5
Food and service was excellent - we loved the extra-cheesy French onion soup and Seafood Bouillabaise served tableside with delicious lobster bisque sauce. Too full to have dessert! Complimentary parking! Will come again.
4
A special occasion place. Ordered a dozen oyster, soup, 2 appetizers and a cocktail and it was $260.
5
Great atmosphere, great food and great staffs. Not the cheapest but certainly one of the most memorable. Attentive staff recommends and explains all the food on the menu.
Fresh seafood platter and a very nicely done burger.
3
Had the lobster roll, and it was really average in comparison to Burger & Lobster in London and another place in SG (which I don't think I should be mentioning in the review for DB).
5
Strongly recommend their db Original Beef Burger. The portion is suitable for sharing and the side dish (fries) tasted superb as well.
1
Definitely not a good option in Singapore where food is really good, one hour waiting after giving our order to the waiter, and received the fries of my burger burned, then ordered some drinks that never arrived and then had to wait again for the bill. in conclusion bad food, bad service and a long wait
3
We had dinner here whilst staying at the Marina Bay Sands.A convenient walk into The Shoppes.The highlight of the meal was the Steak Tartare. The French onion soup,although tasty, had such a thick crust of melted cheese on top it was difficult to access the soup below.Moules were well cooked but the onion in the sauce was undercooked.Two starters and main courses Singapore$150 plus 3 glasses of house red S$72 which was overpriced. Total S$250. (Â£140)Overall very average food and service for the price
5
One of the highlite of our cuisine trip. Another perfect choice in MBS aside from cut. They served fresh seafood and oyster. Happy hours for oyster on 3 to 6 pm. But if you fancy for something more complex for yout palate, try the ala carte menu. Recommendation will be the salmon or the seabass.Perfect
4
We visited DB on the way to watching a show at MBS Theater. When we entered the restaurant at about 11.50 it was empty and to be honest when we left there was only a few patrons. Service was good but not excellent. Considering the number of staff to customer ratio. We had the burger which was great followed up by the molten lava cake which is a must have. The crepes were also good. But if you have the choice . . . the molten lava cake every time! I would go there purely for dessert. Delicious
5
One of the most affordable celebrity chef restaurant in MBS. But it might not lose out on its quality! The burger is really juicy, writing this review alone makes me crave for it.They serve complimentary bread (not plain bread). Quite a few variety. Love one of its flavourful bread. Always requested for more.Nice ambience too. Hey, they even have clean and really beautiful private toilets (oddly impressionable)
4
Very nice restaurant with suberb burgers. Great atmosphere. Above standard food and prices. Staff is very attentive.
3
Just bland food at a high price. I had a lobster roll, but it had very little lobster and they used some spice that distracted from the lobster flavor. Location ambiance and service were good, buts its all about the food.
5
The oysters from Canada were best, the lobster sandwich to die for and the foie gras delicious! No wonder it was busy. I'd go back anytime.
Very good service.
4
Food is as good, service person was friendly & attentive. We would visit the restaurant again for sure..
3
The concept of a french brasserie in singapore is nice. We have been there on our first night. The food is good. Mainly fresh sea food. A bit pricy but good quality food with a kids menu. Only problem is the location... it is inside a shopping mall with no view... it's a shame to be in singapore and not enjoy the views of the city or outdoor dining. I would recommend it for a rainy day or a lunch.
1
They really screwed things up here. Good used to be really good. Looks like they are in cost cutting mode as several of the items, including their signature double fried crispy French fries, have been reduced to worse than McDonalds quality. Sorry but when restaurants where you pay a lot for quality start doing this they lose customers. We pointed out things to the staff and they agreed that the changes have been really unpopular. Sadly won't be going back again
5
DB Bistro has been one of our top fav places in SG ever since we moved here in 2013! Needless to say I decided to Hv my BDay dinner here! The grande seafood tower is perfect for two and well curated cocktails are great pals to wash down the fresh seafood~ consistently great quality food and friendly staff
5
Having been rejected from the Marina bay Sands rooftop bar, Ce La Vie (for wearing sandals), we went back into the mall and found the DB Bistro & Oyster Bar. Having already eaten, we only wanted a drink and were sat at the bar and were served by the bartender. He was fantastic! We ordered some bar snacks too which were average (fries and brussel spouts) but the cocktails were what really shone here. We had 4 different cocktails between two of us, and everyone was made perfectly & tasted wonderful. The bartender was suitably engaged with us when ordering but left us in peace otherwise. Fully recommend this place for drinks (but probably not the food.
4
Had a very satisfying experience that night with my wife. The seafood recommendation was fresh and oysters were delactable. Didn't go for the wine (a waste really) but had their in-house aged cocktail. Drink was good though it would have been better if it's a bubbly with the oysters. Foie gras was overpowered by the apple sauce, but texture of the foie gras was good. Desserts were generally slightly above average but I did enjoy the warm madelines (served complimentary as part of our wedding anniversary). I will definitely come back again
2
My friends and I had high hopes when we went to have lunch there. Unfortunately we all felt that the food was nothing special, some even said it was a strange combination of flavors . We all felt it was definitely not worth the high price they charge for it. Definitely a let down.
4
reliable DB fare: good flamcuche and the burger was as it should be. The wine prices vary: NZ far better value than the old world. One hiccup with service but quickly rectified. Overall a good experience.
4
Visited with our two kids. Food was fresh and arrived quickly. Partner had sea food which he enjoyed thoroughly while the kids and I had burgers. Not the best meal we had while visiting but it was certainly not terrible!
5
We went for lunch and we get surprised of the great food!! We had the pates and foie gras, bernaise and pepper filet mignon, also the scargots and it was all better that eating in Paris. Is it quite expensive but it worth every dollar!!
5
Omg fantastic food, expert bartender, fantastic staff. Pricey but it is marina bay sands. Couldn't recommend high enough.
4
We arrived on a late Friday night, seated promptly, very busy, but service was flawless....attentive, efficient. Food was very good, wine list adequate.
4
Came here for birthday dinner (no free or special dessert tho) before going to the theater with my boyfriend. He had seen online that there was a theater menu, but when he asked about it they said there wasn't one. hmm. Anyway, we had the seafood bouillabaisse for two, with a side order of brussels sprouts. It was served table-side so that was fun. The food itself was very fresh, and very tasty - a little less warm than I would've liked - but we thoroughly enjoyed it. With the 3 kinds of bread they served, the meal was surprisingly very filling. We had a scoop of ice cream (hot chocolate) and a scoop of sorbet (mangosteen) for dessert because we couldn't resist. yum!The service was fantastic. Most of the staff were quite cheerful and very attentive. They came to check on us a couple of times. The ambiance was also very charming, well lit, and quiet - like a fancy bar. Price-wise is Marina Bay Sands price so that was expected. All in all we would definitely recommend and come again (maybe to try the tiered seafood platter we saw many people ordering lol)
5
We had booked dinner at a more expensive restaurant but due to other circumstances had to cancel and ended up at DB bistro and oyster bar and we were glad we did. We had no booking so just walked in, we had fabulous service and when I mentioned in passing that it was my husbands birthday they gave us a complimentary dessert that was DELICIOUS! The organic whole chicken was fabulous and the mushrooms and jus was fabulous along with the vegetables and bread it was a fantastic meal! I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough for their unpretentious service, great food and value for money. Thanks so much

During our visit to the Marina Bay shopping mall with 'top of the bill' stores (you can take that quite literally) we walked past ‘DB Bistro’. After several rice dishes we fancied to eat once again european type food. Well here you can do just that, because it serves a fine traditional French cuisine; in Paris the snails, French fries and charcuterie are not better. Only the bread on the side dish was less; it was cut too early, tough and dry. The (Chilean) wine that we drank was fine too, so with regard to the food and the excellent service it’s a perfect choice if you want to eat French. But then comes the bill, and that is a little shock for a European who, without a business credit card, visits Singapore for the first time. (Should’n have been so stupid to forget that French cheeses cannot travel to another continent for free). Let’s finish this with an “ à la vôtre” as they say in Frenc

I must qualify that we had a pre-determined set meal as part of Restaurant Week. But if restaurants think that just because it is a special promotional set they can offer lacklustre food then it is a mistake. Anyway we are here for the set meal and starters were great. My partner had the Kale Caesar salad and I had a pumpkin soup with cinnamon marshmallows. The soup was awfully salty and I had two sips and pushed it aside. The waitress came by and asked if everything's alright and I told her the soup was too salty. She offered to change it readily. When the soup came back it tasted great. The salt was a bit on the Low side, but we like lightly seasoned food, so the real taste of the pumpkin purée and the crispy melon seeds and contrast with the sweet marshmallow was good!The mains were however so-so. I had a pasta Cavatelli which had a nice texture however the sauce was again a bit too salty for my taste. It was still bearable so I didn't complain. The ever attentive waitress came by to ask how was everything and this time my partner had problems with his salmon. Again, too salty and he felt the chopped tomatoes in the garnish was too sour. I though the tomatoes were ok, but the salty part was true as I could see salt crystals sprinkled on the dish. This time the manager came by and apologised sincerely, and took note of the feedback, and took away the dish. He came back with a fresh salmon dish, served with fresh boiled greens which suited my partner's taste and he was very happy with it.The General Manager(?) also came by and ensured we were doing ok. I must say I am rather impressed by their attentiveness. Desserts were not spectacular but well executed. Chocolate lava cake and French Apple tart were a good close to the meal. All in all, a nice easy place to hang out when you are around MBS.
3
Overpriced and a little overrated. Food was ok. I wouldn't call it an oyster bar, more a restaurant that also serves oysters. It was a nice restaurant with friendly staff but the music they played was strange for the type of place it was supposed to be.
4
The food that twas served was in order and expectaction and the waitress was attentive. She look after guest wel and very accomodative at all time.
5
me and my husband had a nice experience at this restaurant! we had a great pate with seafood! i recomand
3
Average food, slow service... I think those Michelin stars are spread to much around. When you see the name Daniel's name you expect more.
5
Fantastic menu. Oysters and caviar that are out of this world. Stunning lobster. A beautiful evening and fun dinner. Expensive wine list but the norm for that kind of restaurant.
3
I finally made a booking at the most talked about Db Bistro & Oyster Bar, hoping that all the reviews that I read were wrong, but unfortunately, they are true. The food taste flavorless, it lacked condiments such as salt and pepper to make them tastefulness better. The Bouillabaisse was average had better elsewhere, but it was too small as a main course, The Steak Tartare was even worse it did not have all the ingredients, and off course the rye bread were so badly burned, we did not made attempt to try. For the Service it was an embarrassment, unbelievable bad, the staff was not really interested, not on this planet. Is this Daniel Boloud restaurant hope he improves. For the Price its ridiculously expensive honestly said, for these values I think there are better places. A real disappointment
1
Stopped in for a late-ish bite at the bar, 45 minutes before they stopped serving dinner. Our intent was just to have some wine and oysters. The hostess sat us at the bar and while she handed us our menus, she mentioned to the bartender we were there for dinner. I'm not sure if the bartender though he was suddenly invisible, but he rolled his eyes as if annoyed at our intrusion. The hostess laughed as if she found his theatrics amusing. I felt uncomfortable but tried to laugh it off and said "sorry". Then upon further reflection was seriously annoyed that I felt the need to apologize for - gasp - showing up to a restaurant and expecting to eat! Seriously. Keep your oysters and your attitude. I'd rather eat literally anywhere than deal with that nonsense.
4
Love love love the food and service here! The menu bouchon offered from 5.30pm to 9pm Mondays to Thursdays is excellent value at $58 for two courses or $68 for three courses, including a glass of wine! My slow cooked Scottish salmon was done to perfection with super crisp skin. And the dessert, some chocolate and blackberry concoction, was both gorgeous and delicious
5
Went for lunch with my son (as a special treat for him, prob more for me). We had Chope's promotional set lunch. It was really simple but delicious. When you had club sandwich and it was nice.....that is something. I had Tagliatelle lamb ragout and it was divine! My favorite was ￼￼Molten Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel, "Hot Chocolate" ice cream. It was to die for. Well, this is one of the two molten chocolate I LOVE! The burger and oyster bar definitely look great! We are looking forward to going back to try them

I've been to Bolud Sud in NYC for their prixe-fix weekend lunch several times and have always found it wonderful. This dining experience in Singapore, shared with my 23 year-old grandson, was every bit the equal of the NY experience with a decidedly different menu. We took advantage of the S$45 week-end brunch, which is a relative bargain. Service is attentive and very fast - a much more hectic pace than the relaxed NYC experience. (A little slower pace would be worth another 1/2 star if that choice were available, even though I've given 5 stars to each of the categories below.) The menu choices are varied enough to satisfy almost any palate, but weighted toward lighter food. The first course Tuna “a la Niçoise” is outstanding. We chose to add a carafe of an excellent red wine, in effect, doubling the cost of meal. It was worth it. I'd gladly return, perhaps for a full dinne
3
I dined here on a weekday with a friend last month using the Chope set lunch promotion. $28 each got us a main course and a dessert from their set menu. I had the lamb pasta which was very tasty but a little on the salty side, some of the pasta was stuck together which is unforgivable for a high end restaurant. Dessert redeemed the meal, the home made sorbet was nicely flavored and a refreshing end to the meal.They were not busy and we had a good unhurried catch up over our mains and dessert. The portions were large and we left with our bellies full and in a very relaxed mood
4
We were impressed with the menu selection of seafood, food was fresh and staff served fast. Price was acceptable but it was very busy and a bit noisy. We will still be back here
5
First, the restaurant is not cheap. A 3-course menu (offer of the day) came at 68 SGD. However, the quality of the food was excellent, so the restaurant is clearly to recommend.
5
I have visit DB Bistro & Oyster Bar serval times, and every time the food and vine has been perfect with a high quality and a sublime service from the waiter. For me it's a must to eat at this resturent when I'm in Singapore.
3
If you ask a local about any restaurant or dish, be wary with getting the response "it's OK lah..." That is polite code for, "not great, just mediocre". I was lucky enough to have had my meal paid by work as our group lunched here after a meeting. So I'm not going to complain about how much it was...I will say that it is a pricey place (befitting the location really in the Marina Bay Sands mall), and for the price, the food is only just about OK. Nothing stand out, just regular bistro stuff, and not brilliantly executed. It was so forgettable, I can't even remember what I had. So...if you're after something mind blowing, this isn't the place for you
1
Let's be honest for a second: Singapore is aiming at attracting higher income tourists with the recently built hotels like Marina Bay Sand, fair enough when it comes with businesses that will take more money from you because they will give you higher value (see recently awarded restaurants by Michelin for instance). But this comes at times with pretentious shops and restaurants, and DB Bistro is one of them. We ordered crab cakes and the Frenchy burger for lunch. I wished I had spent money at McDonald for possibly higher satisfaction. The burger was crap, the flavors all over the place, the patty over-cooked and flavorless despite asking medium. As soon as I tasted my meal I only wanted to have the check and run. Fries were also a joke given the price they charge. Staff was also rather aggressive in trying to get you ordering more (trying to have you ordering sides without telling you that you meal already include some). Looking forward to seeing this type of pretentious places closing as soon as possible in Singapore
4
We were looking for place for dinner after our business meeting at Marina Bay Sand. We did not have any Reservation. We checked famous beef restaurant there and they don't have a table until 21:00 which is 2 hours waiting. We decided to look around for a nice place to have our dinner. Just opposite, we found this restaurant. Our stomach took control of us so we walked right in. We ordered Kale Ceasar salad, Escargot and Strip loin USDA steak. Although the restaurant was quite busy, the service is very prompted and friendly. Escargot was nice and tender but could be a little tastier. Kale Ceasar salad was fresh with the right taste. The steak was just right with medium pink color as it should be. Above all, the food came in good order and timely. After a long day, this is exactly what we need. No need for long wait in line or long wait for decent food. Recommend
3
This is the 7th Daniel Boulud casual establishments that I have visited and I have to say my least favorite. Having seated next to the open window that connects to the mall the foot traffic can get distracting. It gets very busy and noisy at night inside the restaurant. Both the lobster bisque and onion soup are over-salted, and the lobster salad is over peppered. For those traveling from the US better leave the Boston lobster items back for restaurants at home. The DB signature burger was also a disappointment. I first had the burger when it first came out years ago in New York and it was phenomenon, and since then I have had the opportunity to eat it from time to time. This one is dry, almost flavorless, but tender none the less. Love the gougere at the beginning and the durian souffle for dessert (for those who love durian should find this bursting with flavor). I didn't partake in any raw items, but I wonder if they are all imported rather than loca
4
Been here several times and the experience is always pleasant. It won't rock your world, but if you're looking for good food with superb service you won't go wrong at DB. The oyster bar is quite enjoyable and they do a very nice seafood tower. The burger is quite interesting as well and worth trying at least once
4
Visited here one weekday at 10pm. It was quiet to say the least, but the menu looked good and we were starving. The lobster rolls were excellent - they come with fries and a selection of sauces. Anything that comes with garlic aoli automatically gets 4 stars with me. Major downside was the price of beer - Â£10 a pint. But hey, it's a posh area and the food isn't outrageously expensive. If it was busier, it would've been a better evening, but overall worth a try

I have previously dined at DB Bistro in Vegas (now long since closed) and New York and was looking forward to locking horns with a DB Burger again. We've also dined at Daniel in NY and at Cut (I know not a DB restaurant, just saying for illustration of US run steak type restaurants) in Singapore.I wouldn't at DB is as good as Cut, but it was very good.5 of us dined, the boy went headfirst straight into a Spaghetti Bolognese, and loved it. We had 2 x Prawn Cocktails and 2 x Crab Cocktails, and whilst the crab was lovely, i was extremely jealous of the prawn cocktail! Much better value for money!For mains we had a mixture of burgers and pastas and such like and I got to get my teeth into another DB Burger. I couldn't finish it! Back in the good old days, i could devour the rich burger, and did several times, but this time it was just TOO rich. Sirloin Ground Beef, Foie Gras and Braised Beef Rib meat on a parmesan bun. I had to leave about 1/4 of it. Sadness.We had several (3) bottles of a low (for them) priced wine, and our bill weighed in at almost S$900! Blimey.I think....given what we now know, I'd go to Cut next time. Better food, better service (not that there was anything wrong with DB service, Cut is just 'better') and probably the same, eye popping bill. Don't get me wrong though. DBB & OB is very good
5
Found this restaurant in the shopping mall of the Marina Bay. Great service and burgers. Dessert was to die for.
4
Though we really only had dessert and coffee here, it was excellent and staff were only too happy to have us. Food we saw on other tables looked fantastic. Would definitely go back to try more.
5
Not cheap but it's great for an intimate meal. We had the maine lobster roll, wild mushroom and tagliolini. Perfectly simple as it is. Fresh seafood, aldente, seasoned and plated...I got what I expected and truly satisfied. They've got those interesting cocktails too!
5
Great food before play and fun nightcap after okay. Nice to have staff remember us. Look forward to returning
3
Tried their burger 2 times and still cannot appreciate the hype...
Very average beef.. Foie gras is average... Bun is below average.
Can skip is you want..
4
Set lunch was ok, had the db sandwich. We were very happy with the tartare. Thats a great dish to try. Service was good. Place is very nice.
2
Despite the celebrity chef status, I'm sorry to say we were deeply disappointed...We booked this restaurant for a really special occasion and totally dressed for it but I can't help but be super sad that we had just walked into an American burger joint...Firstly, the ambience. Loud and the music was 80s and loud..Next the food. The bread basket! The first indication of a great restaurant. We tried the focaccia but stopped there, didn't make you want a second for sure, even though we were famished..Next, the wine list. Quite good but the glasses that came with it!? Thick water glasses, nothing to complement the french white we ordered and we had to make a conscious request (??) for a decent wine glass, a first for me in all the restaurants and in All the countries I've been to, though the request was promptly met.The seafood platter is really average, we could have gotten this in any restaurant..nothing to shout about other than the price.The remaining saving grace were the lobster roll and the DB burger, my conclusion is, this is an American joint, nothing savvy or worthy about to put top dollars into..Won't be coming back, I can get my burger fixes in a dozen other places...I suggest you try Naked Finn for a great seafood crave instead

My girlfriend and I visited DB Bistro for a walk-in early dinner. We were immediately impressed with the friendly welcome and the casual chat as we were led to our table. As we were introduced to the menu, the very friendly, accommodating, and menu knowledgeable lady Mira took very good care of us from start to end.As it was our first time in the bistro, we requested for food recommendations which Mira happily advised; and advised well she did! We ordered the Tagliolini and the Mediterranean Seabass, and both were amazing. The bread basket before that with the served herbed butter is great! We also had a few other small things and all were awesome; especially accompanied by the great service from lady Mira.Our experience was that good that we actually came back the next day for their lunch menu :-).Thank you again for the wonderful meal and overall experience

I came here to have the famous db burger. I took it as part of a 3 course menu, which started with a tasty corn soup. The db burger itself was a bit of an anti climax: it did not taste good nor bad...it basically tasted neutral. The wines served by the glass were bad average. I do not mind paying large sums of money for food, but then the quality should be outstanding, which is not how I experienced this place.To end with a more positive note: service staff is helpful and friendly. They do their best to give you a good time. They are not to blame for the fact that this brunch fell short of my expectations

My wife and I were very excited to eat at DB Bistro after enjoying their food at the recent MBS Food and Wine show last weekend.It was a complete disappointment. Food was lacked flavour and was underseasoned, and really didn't justify the incredibly expensive prices.Wine list was very good, and service great too. Just really disappointing food, especially after how much we enjoyed their stand at the Food & Wine show.Definitely won't be going back - sorry DB Bistro

This place offers remarkable French cuisine, high quality and really fresh, few places I even finish kid's pasta dish! Only downside is that background music doesn't fit the place.
5
One of the best places I have ever tried. A bit pricy as almost everything in Singapore.
Very good service. Staff are all well informed about the food and drinks in the place and they are so friendly.
4
Beautiful dinner, we took the seafood platter and Little miss 15 had the steak. The food was cooked to perfection and the service was first class all the way
4
My hubby and friends had an enjoying evening dining here. This is a chic and swanky restaurant that serves modern french fare. Their own signature beef sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs and foie gras parmesan bun is flavourful and juicy. The service is excellent by this lady Joanna

The location of this restaurant makes this the perfect stop for anyone trolling around the mall, starving, looking for a place to eat. If you are trolling with a client, voila! perfect location and good place to impress.The food is very good, the service is great, wine selection is top of the line.A place to reward yourself after a long morning meeting. Meals are well prepared, executed to near perfection. Lunch for 2, 1 glass of wine, one large bottle of fizzy water, one kale salad, one cream of something soup, one pasta dish: $256 SGD! Yes, baby. The kale cesar salad with chicken was a wonderful surprise. But still.... this place is kind of expensive for a little bit of chopped kale and 2 small pieces of chicken.This is my second visit to this restaurant and have not been disappointed with the food but had forgotten the mule kick of the price.Bring money or land the client. You'll feel this lunch [in your wallet] for a while

Me and my husband decided to eat here without preplanning anything on our first proper night in Singapore. We both ordered burgers and they were very nice. Each burger came with fries, I had 2 cokes and my husband had a pint of beer. The bill came to £62.17!!! For me that's a lot of money for a burger. The service was good and the place was lovely inside.
3
had a relaxing weekend lunch at db. Been wanting to visit since they opened but never got around to it. I ordered the Frenchie brunch set which was quite good for value @ $45++. Se comes with burger, dessert (cheese cake sundae) and a drink (I opted for OJ instead of the Kronenburg beer that was part of the set). The burger was quite substantial and I could not finish it. Beef was cooked to medium rare as requested but overall found the burger a bit salty for some reason. The cheesecake dessert was quite blah. My fren had the ceviche and Chilean seabass which he enjoyed. Ala carte prices were a bit high but I guess that is to be expected in a celebrity chef restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back to try the original db burger and also enjoy the ambience which had a bistro décor with American music
5
Nestled within the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant has the appearance of a classic French bistro. The food is refined and delicious, offering classic French food, with a local twist to some dishes (like the excellent durian soufflé with mangosteen sorbet). The menu changes frequently for added variety. The wine menu is very extensive and well thought out. Don't miss the classics like the lobster corn dog and the Frenchie burger.
1
Very disappointed by a pretentious, clearly overpriced and not great food so-called French Bistro. Couldnt switch the fries with simple greens for the burger, very sad and low quality mozzarella salad, cold crêpes, no stroller allowed in (and that's mentioned nowhere), not freshly squeezed orange juice, steak tartare blendNice touch the hot bread and salted butter with the drinks though. And the place looks nice. I guess i would not be so harsh if the prices were not so ridiculously expensive...Will not come back agai
5
From where to begin I don't know.It was our first visit to DB bistro and the experience was awesome. We had 3 course menu my Wife ordered ceaser salad and I ordered soup it was very nice. Mains were also very good especially chicken. Now the service part. Very attentive service and up to the mark. The server was very friendly and had a good knowledge of wine.Dessert were the best part of our meal. Thank you so much to make Our day special...will be back
4
To be honest overpriced for what you get which is unfortunate as the food was sensational in presentation and flavour. Portion sizes for main meals was the real problem as main size serving was no bigger than the starter?
3
Visited this established twice just to be sure that my taste buds weren't lying. I didn't enjoy my food period.
5
A favorite of my son's family and well founded. They loved the raw oysters appetizer and we all enjoyed our dinners very much. The service is excellent and the food well prepared and attractively served. Very busy and crowded - good to see about reservations.
5
Good choice of menu, nice setting, restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex. Waiters very attentive
5
Ate here twice in one week as we were blown away with the food. The seafood platter was so fresh and also had the best roast chicken ever. MUST have the madeleines to end the meal. Great for groups or for date night. And the service was very impressive
5
I dined here for lunch on Saturday, there were eight guys, and all enjoyed the afternoon at DB Bistro.The oysters were amazing, there were three different types, from France, USA and New Zealand. Overpriced at $80 per dozenSeafood platters are about $350steaks are amazing, but at $80-150 you expect it to be perfect. I requested my steak medium and it cameout medium-rare Service was a little slow, but still professional and friendlyI suggest ordering the shrimp cocktail, it's the old school style with horseradish. Fantastic!The bill came to about $2800 for eight peopl
3
We had decided to go here before watching a show at MBS and were particularly looking forward to trying the burger. We tried the lobster roll and tuna tartare for starters, and the burger and the streak tartare for our mains. All in all, the food was good but not spectacular and even a tad overpriced in my opinion. Nothing bad to say about it though.
4
Did not have much time for lunch.... Shame I know in a restaurant like Daniel Boulud's Singapore hot spot. Anyhow, just Go for the signature "DB burger", real quality beef paddies sharing the highlight with some foie gras, both from France > SGD 42 Had a glass of Luberon red > SGD 20 and the signature "chocolate coulant" > SGD 15 with an Expresso > SGD 7 and a Fiji water > SGD 11Sub Total = SGD 95 + 10% SCT + 7 % GST = SGD 111.82 = â‚¬ 75 = US$ 83A treat, but I don't regret Next time, I'll take more time :
4
When you get great service and food then it's fair enough to pay a premium eg steak for $70+. I couldn't fault the service and food was delicious.Only negative was were a little cramped on the table but apart from that we had a great business dinner
4
DB Bistro is one of few restaurant you want to keep coming back from time to time. Friendly staff, good wine selection, and especially "killer" deserts.... Coffee Napoleon. Last visit was lunch time, not too crowded but I can enjoy my lunch, that's the most important thin
5
We had a post ArtScience Museum pre theatre meal here! It was delicious, and the service was excellent. We will definitely be going back here!
5
Great kale and grilled shrimp salad and healthy portion option for my main, chilli crab linguini.
Both were totally delicious very fresh and quality ingredients.
3
We were told Singapore is expensive but not to the point that one beer cost $11 US
The food wasn't that good the fish smelled a little.
Two people one drink each and 2 fish plates we paid $130 US plus $10 us tip.
5
We went there for a light meal.
Had their sea food platter and some oysters with some fine Italian wine.
The food was nice and the service was great too.
Not a bad experience after all.
3
Food tasted slightly above average. For a family of 5, we spent about $500+ for 3 mains, 1 appetiser, 2 trays of oysters and a small bottle of home pour. Seafood was fresh but the oysters were small. Ribeye was not bad. Just that, for the amount of money paid, it wasn't really value for money; moderate fine-dining style and service wasn't personal. We feel that they were not v patient and just wanted us to quickly eat & leave
5
A great food experience with db bistro for a Saturday dinner. My friends and I got the chance to meet Andrew, the restaurant manager, who introduced us to some great cocktails. The staff is very attentive and always prompt to answer any enquiries. I have to mention Keathon(hope I spelled it right) as he entertained and introduced us to a very good dessert. They have some great chefs there, especially the pastry chef...loved the dessert. Really recommend the onion soup and the rib eye steak...the rest of the menu is to be discovered on future visits. I need to mention also the side dishes, which are awesome...we had the asparagus and wild mushrooms.Great chefs, great staff, great food, great wine and a fabulous dining ambience and experience..
4
It was the second visit since many years ago. The DB burger as i remembered remained it's consistency with the really tender sirloin encasing braised short ribs and foie gras. The charcuterie (large) featured homemade pates with the pork terrine being my favorite. The highlight of the meal was the lobster martini which though seemed small, was actually filling enough with refreshing 'salad' beneath cool lobster meat! Prices were on the higher side, especially the escargots, but quality make up for it. On a side note, service could be more consistent as there seemed to be many different staffs serving us and while some food had their ingredients introduced, some were not
4
Nestled inside the Marina Bay Complex, is this stylish restaurant.A wide variety on the menu with regular specials. The food is predominately seafood, however there are some carnivore dishes. Fresh chucked oysters, prawns, fish cooked or uncooked in a variety of different ways.Wine menu is relatively extensive with wines from RSA, AUS, NZ, FRA. Service is reasonably good, however on this occasion, topping up of our wine was done by us. Well worth the visit as the quality of the food is very good. Value for money - on the upper side, but worth it due to the quality of the food.
3
We stopped in for a quick lunch after visiting the gardens. The place was packed, but we managed to get two seats at the bar. We had a burger, lobster roll and wine. They have a great wine list, but you will pay for what you get. The food was average. The burger was ordered medium rare, but came back medium. Ok, that happens on occasion, but it also dried it out. The meat in the lobster roll was good(not too generous), but the roll was dried out. Two for two on the dry factor. To be fair, we did not bring either of these issues to the attention of the restaurant, so I am not sure how they would have been resolved. The fries were excellent. The wine we ordered (Joseph Phelps) was $65 glass and tasted great. The weirdest thing was that it was first poured into a beaker, then into the glass. Yes, a beaker like in chemistry class. Talk about being exact with the pour, I have never seen that before in a high end restaurant.
4
Out in Singapore on business on my own wanting a simple but quality dinner. When your dinner companion is a kindle the restaurant needs to understand your need for good and friendly service.The DB Bistro offers great quality French style food and the service was very friendly and understanding.The wine list and cheese selection was impressive for a restaurant in a shopping mall but then it is in no ordinary shopping mall at the Marina Bay Sands!The bonus was that if you stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel you can charge your dinner to your room
3
You can easily find a better place. If you finished trying many places , you may want to come here. Not additive at all.
4
Wonderful setting with an extensive menu with a good price range. You have have a beer and burger or a $300 seafood platter. Fresh produce and excellent service. Our 2nd visit.
4
Good service. Burgers are of fine quality. my favourite is however the dessert - Durian Soufflé. Love it!!
5
Very good food, the steak tartare was really good, according to my husband.
Nice atmosphere, though a little dark.
I found the prices on the high side, but that's the case with Singapore.
5
We dined here for my birthday and were very pleased with both the food and the outstanding service. The oysters and shrimp cocktail were amazing and the crab cakes were some of the best I have had. We ordered many things off of the menu and everything was great. It's a nice, relaxed atmosphere as well which is great for families
3
Almost empty when I was there. I ordered a carafe of wine, a salad starter and a ribeye. Salad was OK, ribeye was a bit tough, the foie gras was decent. However, I could have had the same meal in Puerto Vallarta for example for 1/10the the cost. Three digits for this?? Still trying to understand Singapore but I see a city of conspicuous consumption....trying to imply and perhaps infer status. Anyhow, I won't be back
5
It was my first visit and it was a pleasant experience. I went there before a show at the Sands Theatre (which is right opposite the restaurant. Before we were brought to our table, the thoughtful staff asked if we were catching a show. We tried the 2-course Pre-Theatre Set Dinner and we had the Salmon and Coq Au Vin Blanc as the mains. They were both superb and the service was great. At the end of the meal, we were just in time for the 7:30pm show.
5
My husband and I were staying at the Marina Bay Sands for our honeymoon in April and visited DB Bistro for brunch. We had a lazy morning and were looking for something close by and DB Bistro was perfect. Being connected to the hotel via the mall it was super easy to get to and a perfect choice.I opted for my favourite brunch menu 'Eggs Benedict' with a Mimosa and my husband had the burger. I have to say that it was probably one of the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had! both of us could not have loved our brunch more
5
Just popped in for a quick snack and a beer at the Bar and had a great time. Whilst the Country Pâté was very nice, maybe less bread/brioche would be appreciated as it was way too much to accompany the dish. The Bar staff was exceptionally friendly and gave me a nice portion of freshly baked Lemon Madeleines (they were fantastic!) as a gift to go. This is the kind of touch that make customers return. Thanks so much
4
We were here in 2015 and everything was very good. A friend in Singapore suggested we meet here for lunch. We arrived a few minutes early were seated and some water delivered to the table.The menu caters both for meat lovers and vegetarians, we all had two courses each. Throughout the meal the staff were attentive, professional and courteous. Nothing too much trouble. It was just as I remembered it.A pleasant way to spend our last day in Singapore
4
While the food was good and service ok. I would suggest more attention be paid to the visitor/tourists. I observed a lot of attention being paid to people being welcomed back and not the same level to us or other customers.
4
I was there with my 9 year old twins. The 3 of us were well take care of by the wait staff. Food was lovely, steak was yummy (a tad pricey). Pasta and desserts were wonderful too
4
We had a good meal with friends. There is a nice selection of sea food, but also beef of various types (burgers, steaks). The food was tasty, the service was responsive, the wine was excellent. It was also a hit on the pocket book.
5
Visited with my husband. i had some sides as wasnt too hungry and he had the burger. food was real and tasty!
3
We came here for a celebratory dinner. The food is generally of high quality but there is really nothing special about it. I had the set dinner menu, available before 7pm. For S$58+++, you get a 2 course meal. I ordered the kale caesar salad which I loved. The anchovy dressing paired well with the crunchy kale. The second course was the slow cooked salmon, which was cooked perfectly but the sauce accompanying it was a little too rich. After a few mouthfuls, I could not continue with the dish. Dessert we ordered a la carte and that was disappointing. I've had my fair share of chocolate lava cake and this one just did not make the grade. It was ordinary, to say the least and I really hated the caramel sauce. There was just too much sweet in one dish.The service was really so-so. The staff are not rude but they were not warm and welcoming. The word that comes to mind is perfunctory. No recommendations were made; there was little attention to detail that one would expect from a restaurant in this location, and they let the cat out of the bag. Let me explain: it was a birthday celebration and we had preordered dessert and were specific with our instructions on who the birthday person was. The waitress went straight to the birthday person and declared that dessert had already been ordered so the surprise was ruined. She did apologise and we are not big on surprises. I am writing this because I know many would be particular about this.Other than the above, we had a pleasant meal and evening
4
We were staying at The Fullerton Bay Hotel and decided to go for a stroll and check out the other side of the Bay. What a surprise another shopping centre ( top notch designers everywhere ) we enjoyed a few drinks and dinner at the DB oyster Bar service was good as were the meals , the casino is in the same complex worth a visit before or after a little flutter .
5
I really enjoyed the nice service/attentive staff, and great food! A bit pricey, but quality is great and location as well :)I chose oysters as a starter (very fresh and tasty - served with onion and vinegar, tabasco) and afterwards a lobster roll. My best lobster roll experience - the brioche bread was perfectly toasted, awesome lobster salad with avocado, chili and celery. Definitely going back there for the roll and oysters
4
The duck confit was crispy and it surprised me. It surely doesn't look as good as it tasted. Also tried the db burger and my partner loves it although it wasn't really to my liking. But I guess, to each its own? The bread starter, though was really delicious especially the cheese ones. It's replenishable too, so....you know what to do :
4
Great place for French food in Singapore in a good authentic setting. Located in the Marina Bay Sands which is very convenient. Although the restaurant closing timing is a bit early the food and service more than make up for it. It is a must do!
5
We dined at this restaurant as it was located on the Marina Bay shoppes and we wanted a french dining experience. All I can say is WOW! We tasted the caviar which was absolutely amazing, escargot, seared foie gras which was a first for us to which we quite enjoyed, and also the steak tartare which was delicious also. Our main dishes were the Duck Confit and Bouillabaisse Royale which were both delicious also but we were still so swept up in the tastes from the starters as mentioned that we could not seem to wnjoy our mains as much as we would have liked to
3
ordered the lobster roll and new england casserole. Roll was average but casserole was good, with lots of mussels and clams. Service was acceptable though could have been a tad more prompt. Enjoyed the complimentary ice cream courtesy of booking via Chope!
5
Very nice food and choice, specially if you want to eat seafood... the brunch menu is extensive at 68$++, seating inside is nice with friendly staff very professional. Music is a bit loud to our taste.
5
Though we went there without a reservation, we were so lucky to have one less than 10 mins.
We ordered the signature seafood platter, some Salads, Steaks and Salmon. The tastes are great and the service is good too.
2
Tried their 'famous' DB Burger with Foie Gras for 42 SGD - average at best. Sides of fries and brussel sprouts very average.While the burger was properly cooked, overall taste was not anything remarkable. Expected more from a burger at this price point.Service was ok ...nothing great . Took my orders and put food on the table. Worst part (and why they get 2 instead of 3 stars) is that it was not a particularly friendly environment (manager took time to greet and check in on the two tables next to my family and I but didnt bother to check in with us...not even a glance..literally skipped us)Not recommended and wont be back. Spend your money elsewhere
3
Overall food was decent. Some dishes actually tasted a lot better than it looked. Presentation could have been better for this price range but overall, everything tasted good and service was alright. A good place to break from an all day shopping spree but not quite to make a special trip for
2
Largely a disappointing experience. We booked DB bistro as we were going to a show at the Marina Bay Sands which is conveniently located opposite..I tried to order the signature DB burger without the tomato, my wife stuck to the set menu which was probably the best option. The waitress hesitantly told me they wouldn’t be able to remove the tomato as this was a signature dish however they could serve it and then I could remove the tomato myself… (I almost laughed in disbelief). As she left the table I decided to ask another member of staff if this was correct as it sounded far fetched and they said they would check. The manager then returned and as he began apologising, and as I was expecting him to say the orders had been placed, he again confirmed the chefs stance that regardless of preference/requirements I wasn’t able to order that dish.I was astounded by the arrogance and had we more time before the show I would have left. I ordered the French burger which was small and disappointing. This was a poor experience and given the competition in the MBS there is no reason to return to this outlet. I should point out that we were given some complementary baked goods as an apology however this doesn’t make up for what was an overpriced meal with embarrassing standards/policies
5
The greatest Oysters I have tasted for a long time! They were Americans, slightly sweet, refine, so fresh! Flamenkuche was as usual, Ribeye was very good. Great wine selection, I tried the Anjou (from Mosse) with Oyster, fantastic! and Cht Trevallon with the red meat, which worked very well! Madeleine at the end were warm and delightful. A very nice evening in a consistent Brand, where I always enjoy going back..
3
Wife and I ate here last week just before watching a show at the MasterCard Theatre. The host did ask if we were catching a show so to ensure our food is served on time. That was very helpful. The servers were polite and their service was generally good. As for the food, the appetizer (jumbo shrimp cocktail) was exceptional, but the rest of the meal, including their seafood casserole and famous db Burger was just so so. Given the price, you may want to consider other restaurants nearby, as there are many to choose from
5
Went on the first night in Singapore, and ended up to be an excellent choice. Many different choices for selection and big portions of food. Service was nice as well and overall experience is fantastic.Situated in Marina Bay Sands mall which was convenient for access. highly recommended.
4
Dined at this restaurant several times and we never fail to order the DB burger. It is that good. Foie gras mixed into beef patty is a great idea and elevates the dish. The seafood here is fantastic and fresh. You must order at least a dish from the seafood selection. Pasta and burger on the kids' menu always take care of my children. Perfect place for families to dine at
1
Food was mediocre, service was acceptable but it was seriously over priced. Overall don't waste your time and money here
5
DB Bistro has been a staple of girlfriends' luncheon place of mine for years! The constantly updated cocktail list always brings us much joy, surprises and satisfaction. The food is great as well although a bit on the salty side in my own opinion.
5
Not the cheapest, but the food was absolutely outstanding quality and very fresh.
We were served by a waiter Reynaldo, who was everything a waiter should be. Polite, explained all the dishes, very attentive. A really nice person and a credit to the restaurant
5
I had been one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. We have been going there for years. It's stylish but telexed, the food choice is great, money for value!
5
Had a Seafood Platter with Oysters, Jumbo Prawns & Lobster Tails as a starter, & the Bouillabaisse Royale. Haven't had any better!
4
Great oysters from USA with East Coast and Pacific Northwest represented. Bit disappointed in the fish with a lot of farmed fish on the menu vs wild, sustainable. You would think DB would be more into sustainable seafood as a star chef.Excellent roast chicken! Fell off the bone and very moist. Ok chooped salad.Well informed service and reasonable priced wine menu made this a perfect place to entertain friends. Would go back for the oysters and chicken anytime.Hopefully they'll get hip with some WILD fish in the future
1
Terrible experience! There's an offer with DB giving a free sundae for every booking made via chope. There is no mention of minimal purchase or term and condition online or when we spoke to the DB staff. We like db's chocolate lava cake and ordered it, together with the 2 free sundaes. A senior staff walked over to our table abruptly and questioned us why we didn't order anything and asked if we just want the free sundaes. We were embarrassed! Other patrons were staring at us. We said we did order - the lava cake. He said the staff didn't hear our order and thought we were there just for the free sundaes. There was absolutely no reason to shame us like that since we checked beforehand and there was no minimal purchase and we did order but the waiter did not hear us. We are writing about this terrible experience in all social media platforms
5
We were there to celebrate my son's birthday with my family...ate the lobster, seared foie gras, seafood casserole and the soups. Superb food with quality. Service was magnificent. Try the pineapple mocktail not forgetting the bayfront cocktail....very refreshing. Desserts tester if I am not wrong was marvellous. Will be back again to try other dishe
5
We dined in this restaurant while on holiday this week. We found the restaurant very inviting with a lovely atmosphere. Our waiter Ray provided us with exceptional customer service throughout our meal.I chose the Alsatioan Tarte Flambee with Escargots.... devine and delicious. All our other choices were just as tasty. Topped off with a very refreshing Champagne Sling.Thanks for a great meal
2
Came here on Sunday night with friends with high expectations because of the famous chef behind the brand, I could not be more disappointed in terms of food or service, I suppose coming from Europe I am use to good French bistro with good standard but here it's fine dining with Michelin star price ouch
5
Good food and great service. Just a little pricey though. Great for girlie outing and celebration of special occasions.
5
This is the place you want to be if you're looking for a great Manhattan and fresh Oysters. You have Chef Jonathan working out at the Oyster bar and never had any bad oysters before.
5
Will come back to this place asap. Great food and great service, a bit pricey but worth it. Fantasic place to go on a date.
4
The food was really good. Steak tartare was super flavorful, and although I thought the duck confit was a little overcooked, it was still tasty. I was expecting a bit more with the service, though. Our initial server was a very pleasant man. We ordered from him and then he basically disappeared. Passed our table over to a different guy who came back to do refills, clear plates, etc. We had ordered a decently expensive bottle of wine, which he kept spilling ever time he refilled our glasses. It was a perfectly fine dinner, but I was expecting more polish from the staff
5
Been here last week with a friend. Excellent ambiance, good food quality, and services. Great venue for Lunch/dinner. Also have private dining area if you intend to do business lunch/dinner or farewell event in the restaurant.Must try their signature DB burger, and dessert. Good food and experience so far. Service staff very attentive and great smile. For dinner, would recommend to try the oysters combo. A bit pricey but reallyworth it
3
Unless mistaken, could not find a French wine below 125 Sing, most of them were above 200 Sing. The burger was 42 Bucks , and came over cooked with a strange black brown paste atop of It .. I think purÃ©ed mushroom ? Signature Burger ?!! The steaks were also very expensive like 75 sing dollars a head . Oysters were good but minuscule .service was good , friendly
5
THE ORIGINAL db BURGER I have to say is quite surprising by its combination and the ingredients usedSmall in size, don't expect a massive burger, but BIG in flavorSirloin burger, illed with braised short ribs & foie gras, served on a Parmegiano bunI had it with a glass of earthy French red from the south, sorry, I forgot its namePerfect combination tooA bottle of Fidji water to rinse the palate before an expresso, and voila, an excellent lunchFriendly staff Bill at the level of the establishment, but hey, sometimes worth spending the penny, and this was worth i
5
We ate at quite a few of the celebrity restaurants at Marina Bay Sands but found this the best. In fact we went back twice.We stayed MBS and were keen to try the offerings of restaurants but this was a stand out. Our waitress Olive was outstanding. The food was nothing short of sensational
5
Been going her over the years more than 7 times, visited here for lunch and dinners. Never been let down. Service is fantastic! Simply wonderful. Steaks are amazing, love their burgers, and their molten chocolate cake is mindblowing. I've gone to dinner elsewhere and came back here just for their desserts. Never been let down once. Throughout the years ishes have changed and been updated. Their molten chocolate cake is now with added slated caramel, but the changes are for the better. If you are not sure what to eat in MBS please do not give this a miss
5
Came here to celebrate my birthday with my wife. It was my first visit and the quality of the food did not disappoint. We ordered the grilled lobster and the seafood royale. Both main courses were excellent! Worthy of the hype generated for this restaurant. We ordered the fresh oysters for appetizers and they were some of the best we had. I dare say the oysters were better than some I had tried in European oyster bars!Would definitely come back for another gastronomical gratification :
5
I've now been here twice and loved it each time. Best seafood platter! One time I had prawns in a garlic sauce- still dreaming about it. Service was good. I highly recommend.
5
DB bistrot, didn't disapoint as usual. Very attentive but no overbearing service staff, great food and pleasantly surprised with the birthday gift for my wife.
Congrats and we'll be back agin soon
3
A casual dinner affair with great food although it did feel that the bread basket got smaller. Drinks are great too.
5
It was our second time to dine at DB last Saturday. The first time was 2 or 3 years ago, when it wasn't an oyster bar yet. We heard from a friend that they have this delicious seafood platter and we thought we'd give it a shot. We ordered the Grand sized platter which was around 175sgd. It's a three-tiered serving with the lobster on the uppermost tier. in the middle you will find an assortment of prawns, mussels, tuna tartare, etc. At the bottom, are a dozen of oysters from Brittany. There is also an assortment of dips/sauces to mix and match with the fresh seafood variants. Had a glass of rosÃ© and the flavours and textures just came together perfectly. The restaurant was full that night but we thought we were attended to promptly and the staff was very nice and accommodating. I'd say DB is one of the better French bistros in Singapore
4
Visited here for dinner, service was good and starter of Potato Soup was good followed by a lovely Seabass,Menu a bit pricey with Seabass at 40 dollars and wine the cheapest at 95 dollars.A very nice cheese soufflet was served as a chefs offering which was superb, well worth the visi

We ordered the Grand size signature seafood platter with Champagne. They gave us a three tier displayed plates (sauces at the bottom, then oysters and some cocktail salmon/tuna/prawn on the first tier, prawns and mussels on the second tier and top tier with lobster) and it was higher than our heads, kind of had the fear of the highest tier with lobster might fall on my head anytime. We had to raise our hands very high or stand up to get the upper tiers (mussels, prawns and lobster etc), it was not as convenient for a lady with dress to raise arms or stand up all the time searching for food in a french bistro. To compare the rating with other French Bistros that I have visited or the fresh seafood platters that I have tried before: Food quality wise, it was a good average. Service wise, it was good. Value wise, it was average

I had an early dinner with my husband. We first had the petite seafood platter which came with half a lobster, 4 oysters, 3 kinds of ceviche, 3 giant prawns and 3 mussels. It came with 4 kinds of sauces. Everything was very good although my husband thought the claw from the lobster had a "funny" texture. I tried it muself and it was okay. For our main course, I had the french onion soup - i always order this when i see it on the menu, and it did not dissapoint. I wanted more soup though because the bread soaked up all the wonderful broth so fast. We shared their scampi appetizer which had mint, rosemary, thyme, parsley, croutons and shrimps. When the server put it down on the table, the smell of that thing was SPECTACULAR!!

A return visit warmly remembered from not long after it first opened proves this outpost of a celebrity chef is still good-- but not very. Service up til the ridiculous botched paying of thr account was indeed friendly & speedy-- but flawed attitudes meant we were kept waiting nearly 15mins for the settlement which was further marred by the waitperson wrongly insisting on a signature --which he didn't even check! It spoiled a nice dinner... As could gave the absurdly loud music which lent a frenetic mood to a pricey meal making 'value' hard to prove-- the burger $39 was one thing, but with one 150ml glass of red wine @ $24!!! That was another

Just had valentine's dinner at DB. Was looking forward to it for some time. But food was rather disappointing for such a big name and certainly not worth the price or return visit. For starters, we had the jumbo shrimp cocktail. The shrimp was large enough. But felt that it had been frozen some time and too firm. not as fresh or succulent as it should be. The sauce was literally full of horse radish and was super spicy. Both of us nearly choked on the sauce as it was too strong. The menu said that the sauce was "home made cocktail sauce and lemon" . Nowhere does it say strong horse radish sauce.The bread basket was cold. This was a particular no no for me as I consider this a 5 star restauarnt and expect them to serve freshly baked bread. CUT and MOZZA next door had no such problem.For mains, we had the signature DB Burger and Coq Au Vin. I only finished half of the burger as it was really bland and tasteless. The patty was supposed to be made with sirloin and foie gras. But it is rather dry and tasteless. The irony is that the burger bun and fries tasted better than the patty. Big Mac probably had more taste. The chicken was very tender indeed but it was literally tasteless as well. Similarly we had the Burgundy Escargot. It too was very bland and I just could not taste the Escargot, nor the garlic or pesto.Overall, service was ok and quick. But the dishes were a big let down. It was just an average meal that was very bland and tasteless. Not worth the money at all

My wife & I ended up having dinner here after looking around the Marina Bay Sands Mall - they were extremely courteous, made sure her vegetarian needs were satisfied and were friendly and prompt with their service.Everything we had - salad, entrees and desert were terrific - so singling out any would be unfair. Thanks for a memorable evening

We had dinner here to welcome a friend to Singapore. We can say she's had a great welcome with the delicious duck confit, and alright service (they were understandably too busy though).
Oysters were pretty good
3
The food wasn't as we expected in the class like DB. The Cesar salad was too salty, the prawn on the plater a bit over cooked but the steak was perfectly cooked. Nothing special.
1
I'm from Thailand and I've try that burger it's not close to good
Thailand street food even better and just 1% price

I will not talk about Daniel Boulud which is a famous French Chef who made is name in NYC and opened DB Bistro in MBS in 2011... but about my last dinner there.Since they revamp the place, they now offer oysters and seafood platter with a french feel... And the menus relatively simple, few appetizers, small selection of main courses but to my taste, too many burgers.... Yes that's the trend of wanted to be "American Style" and because USA is where he made his name, I can understand.First of all the service was good, quick to take your order and kind of attentive, no complain about that, except the fact that the waitress will remove your bread plate (you know, the side plate on your left) while still eating our main course, but this is, maybe to give us space, but the overall food wasn't so good, really average for something which I will qualify as not cheap (3 main courses "A la Carte" and nothing fancy) for a total bill of almost S$200...Average rib eye ($78++) with way to much pepper, served with Bearnaise sauce which by the way, had to much vinegar which doesn't make it good, and a too sweet Peppercorn sauce. A Duck Confit (S$40++), mostly from a can or frozen... Well I will not say anything as I never saw a fresh and homemade Duck Confit in Singapore, and a Tagliolini with Crab (S$42++) and I am still looking for the Crab....Overall, I will call this place expensive for an average food...

Ate here while at the casino. The food wasn't bad, but it certainly was not exceptional. Having been to most of the restaurants there, it seems Puck's is the best of the celebrity chefs. Marios is not bad and like all Ramsay restaurants, give yourself an upgrade and find a McDonald's.
5
Without question on of my favorite spots in Singapore. The food is consistently top notch and the service is fantastic. To be honest, I can't think of another restaurant in Singapore that offers this level of service The sommelier provided some great insights into our wine selection and a great touch when the General Manager thanked us for our patronage as we left. Wifey had the French Boullibase.The proteins were cooked perfectly and the broth was absolutely delicious. I had the 300 G NY Strip along with Cauliflower Gratton. The steak was cooked perfectly and the Cauliflower Gratton hit the mark. The seasonal Oyster appetizers ( French and Washington State) were great and the Jumbo Prawn were tasty and the wonderful cocktail sauce added a real zap of spice to the dish Finally, the bartender makes a very delicious Manhatten
5
The set menu offered from 5.30pm to 7pm is excellent value and the six of us ate the two and three course set with a glass of wine each, for a group total of $465. I thought this was very good value for the location and the meal we enjoyed. The coq au vin was one of the loveliest I have ever tasted; really succulent chicken with a rich, tasty deep brown sauce with hunks of pork and zesty pearl onions. The others in the group had very generous slabs of grilled salmon.For the starters, the set menu offered a chestnut soup or a delicious goat's cheese salad with pickled beetroot. Again the portion was generous, the food was fresh and full flavoured. The wine pairings were good. I closed with the duo of cheeses, served on a wooden board with fig jam and toasted raisin bread. The duo were what seemed to be a large triangle of stilton with a creamier white cheese not dissimilar to taleggio. My colleagues closed with chocolate and raspberry tart or ice cream and seemed satisfied with them. The efficient, shaven headed European maitre d was on hand when we needed him, and the Filipina who served us was patient and kind to an older member of the group who had problems reading the menu in the low light ambiance. All in all a very pleasant evening - but get there before 7pm to enjoy the set
5
I had the lobster cocktail to start and my husband had the prawn cocktail which were delicious and beautifully presented. I then had the burger and my husband the steak. The burger was probably the best burger i have ever had - unfortunately my husband can't share that opinion with me as i wasn't in a sharing mood! The service was brilliant. In all it was a great meal and not overly expensive compared to some restaurants in the Marina Bay Sands. My sister lives in Sing so would definitely go back there next time ;-
4
My wife and i called in on a very busy day for lunch to be met with attentive and friendly staff. We were shown to our table and immediately made to feel very relaxed, so many lovely choices from the menu, our starters and mains were delightful.Great well run establishment by people who seem to really care
2
Had quite a disappointing dinner here after work on Friday. The atmosphere is nothing special - perhaps I shouldn't be surprised for a restaurant in a shopping center, but I expected more from a big name chef. The food was very expensive for Singapore and of middling quality. The New England Casserole I had was over-salted to the extent the sauce was inedible, and my partner's medium rare burger was very under-cooked.The wine list was good, and accordingly expensive in line with expectations for any restaurant in SG. The service was fine if completely impersonal.Its hard to work out who the target market is for this restaurant; for locals its comparatively expensive to the rest of SG and the food very mediocre. For tourists, you pay the Marina Bay Sands premium but are dining in the bowels of a generic shopping center and could frankly be anywhere in the world (eating mediocre overpriced food).Would not recommend and won't be going back
5
Visited with my wife. Famous for its DB Burger but we both decided to have the steak, which was excellent. Very good and attentive (but not overbearing) service. Highly recommended, and we plan to try again someday.
4
such a good place for food indulgence. quite expensive compared to others but worth coming back because of quality food and perfect ambience!
4
The burger is great. Can't get enough of it. The triple fries are so addictive. If you want quality burger, this is worth every penny.
3
Staff service and ambience are good but I felt the food are overpriced.. We ordered the platter (very overpriced), salmon, steak and burger and total bill was S$350 for 3pax.
4
We had private room and I must say the oysters, shrimps and lobster were to die for. The set menu was sumptuous and we'll balanced. And the pairing of wines with the food courses was well done..service and courtesy were good.. I did not pay so presume this was an expensive meal...worth going to again for oysters and champagne. 
5
Imagine, spending the day enjoying Singapore, we passed by Marina Bay Sands Mall. We decided it was lunchtime and entered the mall and checked out the directory, which by the way, is AWESOME. If you go, you will see the advanced mall directory technology. Anyway, we enjoy Daniel Boulud's restaurant at the Brazilian Court in Palm Beach, Florida.. Much to our surprise, Daniel Boulud had recently opened a restaurant in Singapore in the Marina Sands Mall. The food was excellent, service perfect and the restaurant manager, Andrew greated us with a familiar smile. A plus, the hot chocolate ice cream, is the best
4
Great menu, short but well put together. Had some trouble with choosing what to order. I had the New England Casserole followed by Molten Chocolate. My friend had the the duck and a side of sprouts and bacon followed by Kougelhopf French Toast with Apricot and Fromage Blanc. Delicious all of it. I have to go back and try some of the other dishes.We had a bit of a misunderstanding at the beginning. Nothing big they seated us separately without us knowing the other was there already. Things happen all the time and the measure of a restaurant is how they handled it. DB excelled in their response, we were not too fussed they apologised and that was it as far as we were concerned apart from feeling a little dumb and not having noticed each other. When dessert and coffee was served it was all on the house plus some delicious fresh Madelines Well done DB staff
4
Had a nice early dinner at the bistro. The concierge at our hotel recommended this as a place to eat. We had two adults and one teenager. The cuisine is French based. Nice place for the teenager to be a little adventurous in her eating. The food was good. Price was on the high side but not unexpected since it is by Daniel Boulud. The location is in the Shoppes at the Marina Bay Sands.
5
I was in Singapore solo and staying at the Marina Sands Hotel, so DB Bistro was very easy to get to as the mall is attached to the hotel. I sat at the bar and really didn't need a menu. I wanted the DB Burger and a glass of Champagne. Service at the bar was impeccable and the burger, with its incredible mix of beef and fois gras was top notch. Perfect fries made this a quick but elegant meal.I didn't want dessert, but the server asked if I had a few minutes to spare, please don't leave yet. 10 minutes later, a basket of fresh mini Madelines came out and I was in heaven. Really nice finish to a very good meal
4
Didn't have a reservation but we were able to get wonderful seats and had a great server. Her name was Elmira and she was gracious and helpful in guiding us through our menu choices. We really enjoyed the passion fruit lemonade drink and my wife really enjoyed the fresh seafood
5
An excellent dining experience. That was Daniel Boulud's signature burger and man was it crazy delicious. A restaurant not to be missed.
5
I just wanted to have some steak, but it was just more than a steak. Me and my wife really enjoyed the steak and the smoked salmon was awesome too. One of my best meal in Singapore
3
Seafood platter, with wild mushroom, grilled asparagus. Food is just so so, nothing fantastic, ambience is alright. Quiet
5
The waitress was very polite and patient in explaining the dishes to us. She was also very attentive and quick. The manager also came by to talk to us. The food was good.
3
I know nothing about "celebrity chefs/cafes" - but found out that DB Bistro was one after my meal - as I saw sign indicating it was one. So I went in because the food court was crowded, I was tired and wanted a meal fast - and this place had seating. Not really being used to more expensive restaurants, I was a bit surprised that the cheapest burger (well, they did indicate this place being a burger place from the outside, so I had to try a burger), was about S$30 (Frenchie Burger?) - and so I ordered it. I did like that this place served table water (yes, I'm cheap), and the food came fairly fast. I did like the burger, it was done medium rare as I had ordered (most places either over or under cook burgers), and they kindly agreed to give me salad instead of fries. It was a good burger on the whole, no real complains. It's probably not a place I would come all the way for, but if I was walking around MBS, I may step in to try the DB signature burger. Till next time
5
Being from Australia we have an abundance of fresh seafood available and we have had our fair share of seafood platters, would have to say the one we had at DB Bistro is the best we have ever had, it was all peeled and made easy to ear, along with additions such as sashimi, ceviche and cappacicio.
5
My family and I were on our way to Gardens by the Bay to watch the light show. We decided to have dinner around Marina Bay Sands and came across db Bistro & Oyster Bar. This is located at the dining atrium of the Marina Bay Sands Resort & Casino. Having heard of Daniel Boulud and watched "After Hours with Daniel" on TV, I was tempted to try this. We ordered the French Onion Soup which was basically onion & beef consommé along with Gruyère cheese and croûtons. Not the typical plain onion soup as this one came with Gruyère cheese. If this is the only soup I had for the day, I definitely will be happy.For main meals, we had the Tuna “a la NIÇOISE” salad and Slow Cooked Scottish Salmon. The Tuna Nicoise salad was made up of Tuna Confit, Tomatoes, Boiled Egg, Potatoes, Olives, Fine Beans and Tonnato Dressing. Light and not too heavy but enough to make it delicious yet healthy.The slow cooked salmon came with smoked bacon, brussels sprouts, marmalade, yellow potatoes and mustard velouté. Nicely cooked and tender without making the salmon too dry for consumption. I could peel off the meat layer by layer.If there is a comment that had to be made, the salad and the salmon were a bit on the salty side. Then again, this is French food...
2
I ordered their food for takeaway and my experience with them - from the first phone call to the pick up was less than impressive.From the start, I tried to call a week in advance to preorder their organic chicken and some sides - Jessica picked upMy call and told me they don't accept advance orders, I did ask a few more questions and she after awhile relented and told me that the best they can do is have me call back on the day itself to check if there's a chicken for me to order, and IF there is then I can submit my credit card details and they will potentially hold one off for me. As I was in a noisy cafe at the time trying to figure this out, and Jessica didn't quite put this eloquently considering she said "No" most of the time , I did have to ask her to repeat herself at certain times because we didn't seem to understand each other. She got a little snooty at this point, which made me decide to try to check out any other restaurant but them. A week passes, I can't find another restaurant near my house that has what I want for my dinner so out of lack of options (rather than Jessica's WARM personality) I begrudgingly called them back. Jessica answers again, she is a little more accommodating this time, does her usual spiel of "we will not prepare the chicken for you until you arrive in person and that will take 30 mins". Fair enough, so I plan my entire dinner party preparation around this. She then sends me a form to fill up for my credit card details and gives me a 1 hour deadline to fill it up and send it back. I made the deadline but didn't appreciate that she never mentioned this over the phone as I could have missed it easily. Also, when I asked her for recommendations for other dishes, she couldn't give me any and whatever I requested she had to go and check with someone else before answering me (ie ordering the foie gras terrine starter and if I could pay for extra fingerling potatoes etc).After the Jessica ordeal, I get to Db Bistro to pick up my order. Turns out they cooked it for the time I said I'd arrive. Lovely that I didn't have to wait 30 mins (as I had originally hoped) but because Jessica had insisted that I would have to, I rearranged my schedule to work around this and Ensure my chicken would stay fresh and hot for the dinner party. So I asked them for suggestions to reheat the chicken since it was now 30 mins early, and they just said "oh just heat it up" no further instructions for how to re-heat it to Ensure it stays moist.... Just another example that they don't know their own product.Poor service aside - the food was only subpar. Chicken was passably tender and moist and flavourful, fingerling potatoes were dry, mushrooms were average, foie gras wasn't fresh, their blue cheese salad was enjoyable though. All in all - don't bother with this place. Their service (if one could even call it that) is not worth the hassle for average, overpriced food.

Went to db bistro for very late lunch. Menu was ok. Had the French Onion soup, it is one of the best but was not impressed with the burger. For the price that you pay, the burger was ok and the fries was nothing spectacular. Is it overrated? To me, yes.. Will I come back again? Probably not.. If I want to have a burger, I would go a a typical all-American joint. However, if you are a fan of Foie Gras, this is the place!
1
I gave this place a one rated because of their service which was good. Other than that, the burger tasted worse than any fast food joints and they charge SGD 42 for it.BK mushroom swiss taste even better!!! I asked for the beef to be medium cook but it was medium rare and the burger is TOTALLY TASTELESS. I have not read other reviews about this restaurant but from my personal experience, I will definitely not return nor recommend despite they took my feedback and didn't charge me for it eventually.
5
The food was satisfyingly great and the staff were ever so attentive to all our needs. From the moment we stepped inside until we left the place, the experience was flawless.
4
Had some amazing Steak Tattare here and some amazing burgers. Loved the service and the food. Very understated vibe which is an ideal dinner setting.
5
Excellent food and service as always. We finished off our dinner with Irish coffee & Madeleines - Perfect!
5
great service and food. 3 of us went for lunch. we each ordered the 3 course set lunch and shared. we were there at around noon so there were just a few tables full. the staff who waited on us is really good. she is friendly, attentive, knows her stuff, superb. we had the butternut squash soup, tuna a la nicoise, and pate. i like the soup best for its favour - simply delicious. for the main, we shared the scottish salmon, house made cavatelli pasta and the db burger. the salmon is really amazing. and to round up we had the artisanal cheese, chocolate and hazel cake and apple tarte fine. all were simply yummy. the music is really good, although i must say when the restaurant fills up, it gets pretty noisy. on the whole a very enjoyable meal
5
I sat at the bar by myself to drink and dine here, and the bartenders take the time out to have a chat and make sure I was looked after!I tried the signature burger, and along with the breads and fries, as well as a cute little choux pastry and cheese, could hardly finish everything. I was staying for my birthday, and they even baked me a delicious batch of Madeleines. The GM was circling and mingling with the regulars, which is nice to see. But my highlight staff would be Ernie (I actually don't know how to spell his name!) but he was a fun bartender =)Thanks for having me and all the delicious food and cocktails!
5
Our second time at db Bistro and again, we were extremely impressed by the food; great layering of flavors, appetizing plating, and not too expensive for the quality of food served.Bouillabaisse was to die for. We will be back for more next time we are in Singapore
5
Incredible place with incredible food. A little bit expensive but the food is spectacular. You have to order the lobster roll its a must!! The oysters are really good and the deserts also. Oyster a little bit expensive ($9 SGD each) but everything is great taste
5
Another great experience at DB, this time we had far more time to spend and really enjoyed the time. The food was once again exceptional from starters to mains lets just say the palette was exceptionally happy with our choices. The wine as always was exceptional and went well with our meal. The highlight of our evening was our exceptional waitress Katie who in her own way made the evening from her exceptional service, to her great knowledge of the menu and her recommendations were spot on, even to ensuring we got our discount when paying the bill and then ensuring we new of there other specials and when best to visit. This is one you cant go wrong at, ensure you book to avoid disappointment. We will keep coming back
4
French onion soup some genuine French provincial fare served in a Staub cocotte, whilst the Alsace tart with escargot was delicious, light yet crisp base.Main of scampi provencale and chop salad with king crab both superb. Brussel sprouts with speck also delish.Service attentive and efficient. Noisy, engaging atmosphere with good tunes
5
If you are looking for a lite dinner in a relaxed but classy-looking atmosphere, this is a wonderful place to spend an evening sharing a bottle of good wine and platter of pate and cheeses. They also have creative desserts that look and taste decadent, but don't leave you feeling 'heavy'. The service is always friendly, welcoming and prompt. This is what keeps us coming back
5
Food was amazing, service was brilliant. Waiter made us feel very special by organising a special message written in chocolate on our dessert plate for our 15th wedding anniversary
4
In the Highend Shopping Mall Marina Bay Sands we just droped in to the DB Bistro. We had a warm welcome. Food is served quiet fast. The Burger I got was delicious. Service Staff is friendly and professional.
4
Food excellent, great wine list, bourbons, attentive servers. Overall positive experience. Lovely quality of ingredients in dishes noticeable.
4
to be honest, this place is a 3 stars. the service saved it. i think the quality of the food has gone down over the years. the burger and the sauce is still good otherwise everything else was average at best.
3
Friends and i had the oyster platter. It was amazing! Nicely chilled and fresh.
Pan seared foie gras was well executed topped with apple marmalade. Classic.
5
We have been here most times after a show and it delivers consistency which is the thing most outlets lack
3
So our second evening in Singapore and we thought we'd get a little dressed up and take in one of the celebrity restaurants. We'd checked out the menu here earlier the day before and it looked good so decided to give it a go.The front of house team were a little impersonal (ok so we hadn't booked but the restaurant was only two thirds full) but offered us a nice table.I ordered the duck pate and my wife the giant scampi for starter. The service was efficient and we waited no more than 10 minutes for the food to arrive.To be fair, the service was very good. Our waitress was courteous and attentive but not intrusive. The problem was the food....The scampi was so over seasoned and over spiced and the croutons so chewy as opposed to crisp that my wife left half of it.My duck pâté lacked taste and seasoning and was so cold that I had to wait for it to reach a reasonable temperature to get any taste from it at all.Our mains were disappointing too. I had Coq au Vin. The chicken was blackened to the point of burnt and the lardons were definitely burnt (no not caramelised....burnt). The reduction was oily and synthetic and potatoes over cooked.My wife chose the tartare which was good but again, lacked seasoning.There were a lot of large parties in and maybe this was just a bad night but nonetheless, it was disappointing that the food didn't live up to the service.Sorry!
5
DB Bistro is a fantastic restaurant. I have lost count of the number of times I have visited but (no matter how long the gap is between visits) the personalised, warm service is there supported with fantastic food and drink. The menu provides several Western-flavoured dishes done with a DB twist and each one always tastes great. Prices are very reasonable compared to other restaurants in Marina Bay Sands. As someone who lives in Singapore I would recommend this place any day of the week
3
A Monday night dinner in this bistro was pretty quiet, so the service was attentive. The food was competent without being great, and as we left, we noticed that Mozza next door, an Italian restaurant, was pumping, and 80% full. Made us a bit wistful about maybe having chosen the wrong place
5
Very friendly, cheerful and knowledgeable service staff. Plenty to compliment. In particular, we broke a glass of xxx Sling in the beginning of our lunch. Before we noticed the broken glass can be a harm to our plates of food, everything has been replaced and our Sling (a Singaporean drink) is reordered too. The place was a mess, but the organisation and contingent management of the restaurant staff were wonderful. We had a wonderful lunch in Singapore. By the way, the burger was wonderful too, juicy an the portion was just ok
4
Although pricey, the food and service was great.
My only complaint is the location. Since it's in the shopping center, you can sit in this beautiful restaurant but face shops and shoppers which I found strange.
4
Went there for the lobster roll, while my Wife ordered the Boston lobster salad. The roll comes with chips and dip. Very good serving and very yummy lobster with avocado .
Good place for lunch .
4
We had the famous hamburger and it was very good. Also the French fries, crisp and delicious.
The ambience is fancy and confortable.
4
Was there for brunch, three of us shared 2 brunch set and a seafood main. The service crew has good attitude and take time to explain the dishes and the serving portion is good for sharing especially for small eaters. Will return for sure.
4
The location is inside the MBS building just opposite to the Grand Theater. So good place after show or shopping. The service was Ok. But the food was really nice. We had Roesti with salmon good plate. The lobster was really nice. Perfectly cook, good sauce in herbs and big portion. I would go back just for this plate
2
Visited this place with a group of office colleagues. My experience is based on Mushroom Soup & Veggie Burger (which may not be the best things at this place, therefore, I am mentioning it upfront). Both the items were pretty average and the burger was a bit oily. Not sure if I will visit this place again
5
I wrote "seafood" but they serve more than that. If everything tastes as good as it looks than it must be heaven. We had oysters, and trio of raw fish - ceviche, tuna with avocado - all absolutely perfect. Portions are just perfect, quality of good and wine superb. Half price of wines over 150$ every Monday is also worth keeping in mind. Relaxed bistro atmosphere and excellent service. Highly recommende
5
We had the chance to try the food at Daniel Boloud's Singapore restaurant. Couldn't have been a better choice. As we weren't very hungry, we opted to have a main course and dessert only.My guest tried the salmon and I had the duck as I am always impartial to duck in a menu. Both great choices. The duck was just great. I had the chance to try the durian souffle. Not known to be the best fruit out there but the souffle was awesome. Worth a try.The service was very attentive and on point
5
Lives to her name. Ambience sleek and contemporary. We ordered fresh oysters from the bar - thumbs up! We ordered scallops - two thumbs up!! Seared to the right extent. Succulent and tender, best scallops I had ever devoured. Tasted like foie gras to my palate. Ordered some bailey's coffee and gelato to complete our dinner - Thumbs up again
5
DB Bistro offers 50% off for all bottled wine above $150! There a wide range of selection that you can make, which goes really well with the cheese and food choices on the menu. For the quality or food, atmosphere, service, the price you pay is definitely value for money. The place is classy and not too noisy, good for cosy business talks over dinner accompanied by a glass of wine. DB Bistro is definitely a great place to pamper your delicate tastebuds with affordable wine and delicious food
5
We ate dinner here and the food was excellent. I had tuna salad, salmon and pear tart. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted divine.
3
when you are charged 9 singapore dolars for One raw oyster, you can see what prices we are talking about. The small tartare steak is really small but tasty. It is overpriced.
5
Great burger and oysters. Probably best Burger in Singapore. Good drinks.. Menu a bit limited though with only really fish, oysters, burgers and steaks.
4
An excellent lunch. Food was great, the staff were attentive.
Definitely would go back again everything was perfect.
2
I ate the "chefs signature burger" and all I can say is: he should change his name writing! The meet was good, but the rest of the burger was not. the bread was dry, the sauce ok, and you did not taste much of the fois gras. Can't recommend that one
5
What a mighty burger they serve!! This is the item to try for first timers. One should follow through, on a weekend, with their crepe. Magnifique!! For those of you who likes French Onion Soup, and/or Wild Mushroom Soup, they serve one of the best in Singapor
4
We were going to the theatre and just needed a quick meal. The staff were very accommodating once they new we would be in and out, they even had a menu for the quick turnaround which was absolutely brilliant. The staff were exceptional with great service and a manger or two always on hand. The food was exceptional with a wine list that will make sure you come back. We will be back the next time to take our time and work through the menu and the wine list. Make sure you have time to enjoy this wonderful restaurant. Perfect
3
We visited as a group of 4 who dine out regularly in excellent places. This was one of the much acclaimed signature venues at Marina Bay Sands. The location in the shopping centre was unimpressive.The service was good without being brilliant. The fare is marketed as French but fusion is moe the go here. I ordered (poorly) the signature burger at $50! It was a complete disappointment. The other meals were far better and cheaper. The wine list is extensive and very very expensive. We are into wine all over the world and happy to pay but these prices make a reasonable wine experience with your meal a challenge
4
Went for a very early dinner. we were unable to have the dinner menu so selected from the brunch menu. Service was very good, the food although simple was flavoursome and presented as one would expect. Nice place, not over the top but a good choice within the many amongst the MBS shoppiing mall
5
This is not my first visit to DB Bistro at Marina Bay Sands. As usual, the food was great and the service excellent. My friend and I shared the signature DB burger, French Onion Soup and Saffron Tagliolini as the burger, whilst delicious, can be quite big if you eat it on your own.
4
Had that steak tartar which was excellent, pate with foie and pork again nice and burgers with foie gras. A good burger but not worth 40 sgd. Good service.
5
DB Bistro never disappoints. Good venue for entertaining visitors. Seafood tops the list and they have an extensive wine list. Staff are excellent always!
5
I visit once a year and am never disappointed. The wonderfully light Gruyere profiteroles are complimentary and the Onion Soup , ah, perfection! The service is as close to perfect as you can get.
5
This restaurant and bar provides a good respite from shopping along the Marina Bay. The place is well designed, staffed by very courteous and knowledgeable personnel. I was impressed by the seared foie gras and the Original db burger.
4
This is a very good restaurant in a very chic shopping mall. Yes it's also a expensive. Luckily the wines were half price so we could choose a very expensive Chablis without suffering the price! Excellent desserts and very good service
5
My colleagues took me to this Restaurant last time I was in Singapore... it was fantastic! The food, wine list and service did not disappoint - will return!
5
Been here many times before and this place never disappoints. The service is very attentive, and the waitresses are very polite. Ambience is fantastic, just like the food served here. This time, we went for the original db burger, herb roasted organic chicken, french onion soup and ice cream for dessert. The soup was slightly salty for me so it's better to share. Chicken cooked perfectly, db burger delicious. Ice cream superb! Will definitely be back
5
We had the Brunch Meal Set which comprises an appetizer, main course and dessert. The food were tasty and up to expectations. Service from the waitress (I forgot to ask for her name) was excellent as she constantly checked on how we are enjoying our food, and if we needed anything else. The only pity was that the food portion was too large and we couldn't finish our main course. Highly recommended restaurant
2
See the photos to get an idea of how bad the standard has dropped. The medium Burger was almost raw - tasted like gung. The French fries weren't bad but not worth the price of a 'gourmet burger'. The asparagus starter is a rip-off - scrawny and dry. Will avoid it and go elsewhere. They took the pork chop (which used to be good) off the menu and have loaded more expensive items on the menu - oysters and lobsters. Given the quality of cooking - it is a money trap! I'd avoid i
4
I chanced upon this bistro at the mbs and was impressed by the service. I was immediately seated served a great wine and they were attentive despite the crowd. The food itself was very good. I ordered the lobster sandwich and the thin crust pizza. They were tasty and fresh. Unfortunately I didn't get to try their famous burger. I will definitely be coming back.
5
Fine food, great wine choices & attentive staff - a great combination for a pleasant dining experience. The seafood was sumptuously fresh & attractively presented. Baked Alaska for dessert was delicious...
5
The food was excellent, staff were attentive & the wine (a Bordeaux) a great choice. Baked Alaska for dessert was blissfully sinful.
3
This one had a lot of hype. Although the burgers were really nice, it was certainly not worth its cost. Service was average and not sophisticated at all for such an establishment.
5
Atmosphere was excellent given the fine service staff pays much attention to details. Seared foie gras, DB Burger and crepes worked out to be better than expected. Will be back for fresh oysters, they look yummy!
5
What to do when you're 6,000 miles from home and you're hankering for a burger and fries? Chef Daniel Boulud has it covered with impeccable service, expansive wine list, tasty pom frites and the best burgers in Singapore.
4
So i have been here a few times and it has its highs and lows. The food has been good but not over the top memorable. I have had the kale cesear salad which is very good. The meats have been a little bit too much for me which I could imagine being very good for my other male companions. Service has its good times and also its less memorable times. Overall its this mix bag. Having said that its a great location and directly across from the Theatre so if you need to go to the theatre, this is still the preferred eating spot. It also has a good set business lunch so could be suitable for place for a business lunch
3
Decent wine list, food is good and service was OK. Definitely worth a visit whilst in Singapore. Gets a lot of the theatre crowd so this restaurant gets busy. Needs more work to get to the London outposts standards tho. Better to go to St Pierre in Sentosa for that sort of quality
5
When we are in Singapore we always put db Bistro on our menu, pardon the pun, for dinner.We were recently in Singapore and again dined at db Bistro, simply put, Staff are very friendly and efficient, even remembering us.The food is consistently superb!! Would definitely recommend putting them on your dinning list
4
We went for dinner, no reservation but they found us a table straight away. The service is amazing, very attentive. The food was amazing! The snails for entree and the burger for main. Cooked to perfection. The wine list was very exhaustive, but we were offered the services of the in house smellier, this was a great offer. Over all a great experience. The surroundings were well designed. Then came the bill...wow a little expensive. Worth it all the way, just something one could not do everyday.
3
A bit disappointing this time around as the Burger was overdone and rather tasteless. I ordered Medium Rare and it came Well Done which is a major faux pas at this level of restaurant. On the other hand, my wife's slow cooked salmon was perfectly executed. Onion and Mushroom soup was good but standard far
5
Very good food: fois gras, hamburger and chocolate cake. Worth the money. I do recommend this restaurant.
5
This is my third visit in my third trip and just as good each time. Had the kids this time and they enjoyed it also. The staff are so friendly and helpful .
4
Awesome oysters and seafood platter...lobster salad was good..main course food portions were rather fulfilling
Table seatings were close to each other..not ideal for private dining experience as if u encountered another large crowd beside urs...it's kind of noisy too
Service staffs were friendly and attentive
3
Food, drinks and service is always good. The location is nice and convenient. Prices are on the high end.
5
My wife and I had a late Sunday lunch at the restaurant. We did not have a reservation but were offered a seat at the bar and then showed to a table within 20 minutes which was in line with what we were told as a waiting time.The food was 1st class and the seafood casserole was the best food I have had in Singapore so far. The service was excellent on top of that. What you would expect from a good restaurant anywhere.Definitely a place to return to again and again
4
They were polite enough to take some of our special requests, also they have good wine list and the place is big enough to have tables apart so you can feel some privacy. Also we big group of people at the other table, but it didn't affect our serving tim
5
~we wanted a special place to celebrate our colleague's Siew Hoon's birthday lunch and decided on Yu at MBS but their kitchen was closed for lunch in April so we took a walk down and stumbled on db Bistro & Oyster Bar by Daniel Boulud~without a reservation, we'd asked at the hostess if they could seat a table of 7, even with a half empty restaurant, they took 15mins (in Singapore that's long) to seat us at a round table at the end of the bistro just facing the walkway~the menu is well arranged with the best they knew how to prepare well and it was a well prepared meal~while others had good sized dishes from the 2 course set lunch menu, I selected the Yankee burger instead of the more intuitive Original db Burger (I don't take foie gras)... it was a normal a burger it could get so no big points there... it was the fish that caught my eye and the delicious coq au vin~good wait staff and supervisors were on hand attentively anticipating our needs, can't fault service :) we had a good time together 
2
A couple of my friends were in town and were keen to sample the food at either the newly opened Breadstreet Kitchen or DB Bistro & Oyster Bar. As the former was fully booked, we ended up at DB Bistro, which was sad to say, a mistake.The highly rated DB Burger was definitely NOT worth $42, I doubt I'd even pay $4 for it as it was dry and frankly, rather tasteless!The equally highly touted Coq Au Vin was over-cooked and the fairly tasty vin sauce couldn't mask the dry and over-cooked chicken.Maine lobster salad was so-so and again, not worth the price tag. Only highlight of our dinner were the onion soup and calamari fritters.Service was attentive and efficient but not exactly exuding warmth - perhaps they are taught to emulate snooty waiters at high-end restaurants in Paris
5
Having eaten across at Cut just a few days before (also for my Birthday), I wasn't planning on having steak when I came to DB Bistro. I was encouraged to have it however and did not regret it. I started with the Calamari which was the biggest starter i've ever had and more than enough, I ended up sharing it with the others. Then the steak came, perfectly cooked and with a lovely Bernaise sauce. Wine was well recommended to us by the sommelier and complimented the meal well.The steak was not as good as Cut but for the cost, the cost to quality ratio was much higher and I would definitely go back here again
5
Had seafood mix platter for dinner .. Fresh oysters, crabs, prawns etc! .. Shared it with my husband .. It was rather small compared to seafood platters we found in New Zealand or Aussie But the chef gave so many compliments like bread and a bucket of medeleines to fill us up .. It was helpful .. Thanks chef. Next time we'll try your signature burgers
5
All the food I have tried here is good, particularly the burgers. The ambiance is nice, the service great, the noise level is just right to make it a lively place.
4
Me and my wife had a great exeprience at DB. Food was great and worth the price. Staffs were very accomodatng and responded to our needs quickly. Will recommend this!
5
Wow. Technically I ate a burger in a mall here but it was one of the greatest meals of my life. DB has elevated the humble burger to a transcendental experience. And the Chateauneuf du Pape was great.
4
I was surprised to find a DB Bistro inside a mall....but this is Singapore !! High-priced but great service and a gopod option if you fancy Western cuisine after several days of [by the way : great] local flavours :-)
5
I had a great experience at DB Bistro and Oyster Bar on Fathers' Day. Upon reaching the restaurant, we were quickly led to our table by very friendly and helpful service staff. I ordered the Signature DB Burger and it was literally the best burger I ever had in my entire life! I could feel the foie gras melting in my mouth, and the concoction of flavours with the sauce and meat was simply heavenly! My mother had a "Today's Special" which was a Seafood Scampi, and every single component of the dish was done to perfection. Most importantly, my dad was extremely satisfied with his Frenchie Burger and the whole family really had an amazing dinner there. Thank you DB Mistro and Oyster Bar for the wonderful food and amazing service
5
We were greeted by 4 waiters. Immediately made us feel at home. They brought us appetizers, menus and drinks from every direction. We wanted a burger and the burgers were amazing! Really good service and food. Would suggest it if you are in the Marina Bay area.
1
The food is overly cooked with spices and over burnt, highly unpleasant. Accompanied with rude and terrible service from staff. Can't even give proper comfort and assurance to their diners. There was this highly rude and unhygienic waitress who served us, totally uncalled for. Singapore branch staff are highly incompetent, for an exorbitant price they are charging they can't even appease dissatisfied customers. In summary highly disgusting, DO NOT VISIT
4
I've been here a few times and each time the food has been a hit, especially the whole chicken. In comparison to a few of the other fine dining restaurants in MBS, DB Bistro is well priced and the portions are also decent. The service is professional as well
3
db Bistro Moderne was a really decent place for dinner that evening. But was it as good as most people suggest it to be? Perhaps not. Even my dining companion JH who is usually proud of this db Bistro Moderne joint felt poorly about the Duck Confit that night which lacked attention to detail with the poorly finished bean cassoulet and bitter wilted greens. The price tag in addition was not the cheapest too. Without desserts, the price tag came close to a hefty $140. Full review on: http://wenywonderswhy.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/singapore-db-bistro-moderne-marina-bay.htm
1
aside from paying $42 for a "db burger" that sickened both my father and I, what I remember most about this place is not the over-priced garbage it served me, it is the disgusting mannered-waitress. Over and over again she was beyond rude to my party and I. She had an attitude like we were inconveniencing her by being there. My father is an executive with a fortune 100 hotel company with many hotels here in Singapore. BOY did she make a big mistake tonight!!! He's going to let everybody he knows not to eat here. I can forgive a bad meal, but I can not forgive the dreadful waitress
5
I ate in db bistro and oyster bar and it was fantastic. Seafood was amazing and every wine pairing was phenomenal. Enjoyed everything i ate and will be back very very soon.
5
We went to the restaurant after seeing a concert at the venue. Food at this restaurant was really good - fine dining at its best! Service was extremely good as well.
4
The DB burger is good but not great..you can taste all the flavor of all the meat, foie gras and ribs at the same time... Thought it was overpriced for simple dinner but it was actually pretty good
3
Well that's s I can about the place. We had the signature burger and for that price I can get four burgers at burger fuel delivered from Dubai that are bigger and tastier. The wine is overpriced and the place is extremely noisy.If it wasn't for the great helpful staff I wouldn't rTe it al
5
DB Bistro is managed by one of the world's top chefs - Daniel Boulod and you can sense the qulaity in every dish you eat. They have a DB Bistro branch in NY City which is excellent but the one in Singapore had many different and unique dishes and i was pleasantly surprised by the different options. All in all, not cheap but also not as expensive as such a good meal could be
2
Is this really the same DB bistro from NY? No, no way!!! - The beef filled with Braised Short Ribs and Foie Gras doesn't taste near the one served in NY, it is not the same burger, I repeat: not the same! - French fries are not prepared by them but they have their supplier of frozen fries. - The place looks very very casual, people in shorts, t-shirts and flip flops.- Service goes with the place, average.We left the place with such a bitterness that next day we went to have a real juicy, tasty burger at Carl's Jr for a fraction of the price
2
i have been twice to Daniel and also at DB in New York. My experience at both restaurants was incredibly superb and have a very good impression of Daniel Bulud as a chef and restauranteur. For this reason i was really excited when discovered the DB Bistro at Marina Sands in Singapore. We made a reservation in advance and were very excited to have the opportunity to taste again the delicious signature burger. Let me tell you, what a disappointment. In first place the salad was far from looking fresh, the burger was greasy and a waste of foie grass, and, as confirmed by the staff, the fries were frozen and supplied by a local provider, nothing wrong with contributing with the local economy. The staff, even when attentive, were not professional. No change of cutlery in between first and main courses. In summary we end up paying almost S$100 for two burgers when the next day we went to Carl's Jr and paid S$12 for the most juicy, tasty mushroom burger.I think Mr Bulud should be mindful of his name and brand and carefully maintaining the highest levels of quality in all of his restaurants around the world. Despite the above I am still a fan!
5
DB Bistro underwent a major refurbishment. Not only did the restaurant get a face lift, but it has turned its focus to an amped up seafood menu which is excellent. I'm very partial to the new tiki drinks that have been added to the cocktail menu. Its incredibly hard to find a well done Polynesian inspired cocktail in Singapore. Not only does DB Bistro craft the cocktail right, but they serve it in a proper tiki mug
4
The kale caesar salad was simply wonderful. We ordered two plates of it. We also like the seafood platter which has oyster, lobster, large prawns, clams, mussels and king crabs. They were so fresh and sweet. The ribeye steak was tender and juicy. Though the restaurant was busy and packed, service was very good. I would definitely come back
3
Disappointing. The menu is classic American (Burgers etc.) but the cooking was below par, even simple things like French fries. Given the prices and the founding Chefs reputation, something might have been amiss! Unless there is change in the kitchen, I would just avoid this restaurant
5
I couldn't find anything to complain about. And I was kinda picky that night.
Good service
Excellent food
Great ambiance
4
Called for lunch here yesterday and ordered the bacon cheese burger. It was really good and cooked to perfection.
The place is very attractive and the staff efficient. I don't really enjoy the shopping mall eating experience but this was fine.
4
friendly staff and fluent english
superb menu and nice surroundings
quite pricey but worth trying
will be back to taste other menu
4
the restaurant does not give us the expensive feeling of being aloof. it was a casual looking restaurant with nice ambiance.
3
The restaurant is nice but there is no view because you are in a shopping mall. Food is good but not great S$ 110 ++ for a plate of seafood. A beer costs S$16++. Top restaurant prices for bistro food. Service is average.
5
The burger was lovely, cut into half already so easy to share. But the seafood casserole was a real Gem! So tasty! A must try. We have also tried the dessert- Durian Royale soufflÃ© with mangosteen sorbet -- sounded so Singaporean but yet so unique that it's the first time I have heard these two being served together in a Singapore restaurant! So nicely fit into the atmosphere. Lastly, a glass of French Coffee-- speciality coffee with cognac! So yummy!
5
My first visit there was to try a lunch set which came with a friendly price tag (I was a student at that time). The experience was a good one. The meal was meticulously set and the flavours intricate. On subsequent visits, I ordered from a la carte menu which somehow was no longer as expensive as it seemed to be, and was delighted to find that the quality of the food and presentation was still as good as ever
4
When in Singapore I like to come here for a gourmet burger. They unfortunately snuck pickles (which I detest) into my burger though it was no listed and no other condiments were added. That being said, they have a good beer offering. There's almost always a line, but they decide to always leave half the restaurant happy (presumably because coverage or to create apparent demand?). So, end of the day, The Frenchie Burger I believe it is called is actually quite good and the DB burger is also quite nice. It's a well put together restaurant in the posh Marina Bay Sands mall at the end of the day after all! Value just is not that fanatic all things considered though the overall offering is very good. Not worth a 5/5, but not terribly far off. So, used the 4/5 as it's not quite 5 worthy.
5
I've been there with my wife on January 2015 during our 1st anniversary trip inSingapore after sight seeing in the afternoon we desired to come here for lunch and..it was outstanding they can serve us the best drinks and appetiser(Salad with some mediterranean seafood and french onion soup) came with appropriate quantity not too much or too less for the main course I've ordered pasta with lobster and my wife order new york strip steak which both of dishes were fabulous! One word that in could describe for this restaurant is...come
3
Came here with my family for lunch as I was craving for a juicy and tasty burger but I was greatly disappointed. It was so ordinary and nothing special about their db burger. It was dry and beef patty was a bit hard despite having it medium well, ended up bringing back home half of it as my hubby thought it would taste better with fresh lettuce and cheese. Mushroom soup was bland my son didn't ate his, Iceberg salad was boring my husband only ate a small portion, slow cook Salmon was so so. There was no wow factor I can't wait to have this food again. Maybe it was only our tastebuds that does not agree. But, the seafood casserole was EXCELLENT and deliciously good. I would say db has the freshest seafood selection and a good list of wine. Service was good and efficient but somehow it lacks warmth. We didn't get the vibe that say come and visit us again. Usually, at the end of our food adventure around Singapore we would say when will we come back again? Yes, for the fresh Oyster!!
4
we went as a family. Really enjoyed the seafood sampler. the choices were all high quality and nicely presented with tasty sauces. Service was good, too!
4
great restaurant with very professional and attentive service. My only criticism was that the strip steak was rather more medium than the blue I ordered.
5
I am here almost every week for dinner. I love the db burger. My daughter loves the minute steak and the grill fish. The restaurant is nicely furnished and very cosy and comfortable to dine in. Services is excellent and very attentive. Highly recommended
5
Went to have a New Year's Eve Dinner with the family and wasn't disappointed at all. Everything was cooked perfectly, the wine was great, and the ambiance was very enjoyable. Service was great and very prompt, too. We had a great time.
2
I came here hungry and expected to be blown away by their very expensive signature hamburger but was very disappointed to find out that it was nothing special and in fact not even that good.Save your money and go eat somewhere else.Service was the only thing that was actually very good
4
We ate dinner there by chance on May 1st which was a public holiday. Although very busy, we were in no way hurried or rushed to get through our meal. We had plenty for time to choose from the menu and enjoyed a decent Singapore Sling whilst doing so.The French onion soup was one of the best we have tasted in avery long time and is to be recommended . The rest of the dinner was just as nice , with good sized portions.We would definitely go there again
3
We had eaten here before a year or so ago and while it was OK I felt it didn't have a wow factor and hadn't been inclined to return. Then Friday being a public holiday here we wandered over to MBS and feeling esurient looked at the menus on display outside the various eateries.We liked the look of the 3 course brunch and opted to try it.The decor is not really bistro, it's too cold and chic but it's OK, and we found the service pretty decent.Brunch includes a real drink so I had a Screwdriver and told the missus to order a Bellini as I knew I would end up drinking it as well...Pate and mushroom soup starters, both good, then pasta and Eggs Benedict. My eggs were very good, great quality ham and well-cooked eggs and a decent Hollandaise. The muffins were a touch stodgy though and too much salad on the plate.Great molten chocolate cake for me and average crepes with chocolate sauce to finish. Overall good but we spent $170 for brunch which even here is not a bargain: what capped it for me was an $11++ bottle of water. Pity that the food is pretty reasonable, the quality of the ingredients is clear, but I am just not convinced that it's worth it
4
Came here for a fairly early lunch on a weekend. Service was pleasant and efficient. They kept the glasses of drinks well refilled and took the initiative to manage the entry of the plates. But felt a certain warmth of service was just a tad missing. We enjoyed most of the dishes we ordered including the brunch set menu, a rib eye steak and the burger. Though not mind blowing, they were of good quality? The steak was done perfectly the way I wanted though I thought less salt could be used. Nevertheless, it was very good. I will revisit the place
1
Was having lunch there today & my friends happened to be at the Sands so they dropped by to say hello. The moment they came by & sat down, the waitress rushed over & said that they do not allow 'this'. I told them that it's gonna take 5 mins for us to do a quick catch up. They're leaving for the airport anyway. Less than a minute later, another came by & said the table we're seated is too small; only for 2 persons. In that 5 minutes, 3 waitresses dropped by every minute and asked if we are done. It's like they are trying to shoo my friends away & I felt so embarrassed & guilty cos I asked to meet them in the first place. The last straw was when one of the waitress came & said that they need the table next to us so my friends need to go immediately. So my friends left, and for the rest of our meal, no one was seated next to us. This restaurant has the worst service ever, being a 3 Michelin Star restaurant and the food was just so-so. It's not worth the money paid & was overall a lousy experience. The people there do not have a heart & are just 'doing their jobs'. If you're planning to have a good meal with friendly & helpful people, avoid this restaurant
4
I'm afraid the food is not up to expectations, unlike Mario Batali's Osteria Mozza, which is just beside this restaurant. Surprisingly the cavatelli pasta served on the sunday brunch menu is way better than any pasta I've eaten at the Osteria. Weird. Or maybe the chef at DB Bistro uses better wine for the pasta sauce?The ambience is very cool and calm, not really a bistro and sadly it affects the cuisine. The food is by no means bad, it tastes clean which means it lacks the soul of many bistro favorites. I have never eaten the burger here, hey Daniel Boulud has to adapt to American tastes but I have faith in a Frenchman's patriotism when it comes to food. So when you eat here, order the pate, the duck confit, the pork belly, the seafood stew and the poor reviews may just turn into good ones. Good, not great.The wine selection is ok but the sommelier can be a tad more helpful.I eat brunch here because they serve it till 5pm on Sundays--very much my schedule. However, I've yet to know how they choose patrons to whom they give the madeleines at the end of the meal. The madeleines are great, but sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. The food here is expensive and can be explained by the quality of ingredients but having the madeleines not only satisfies my sweeth tooth but also makes the meal a great value. And it makes me feel bad seeing some tables where they left the treat, wasting perfectly good food (how can people do this, wasteful consumption is not a part of french culinary culture).I think they made some compromises in this restaurant, especially in budget conscious Singapore. As with most higher end restaurants, ambience is often prioritized over quality of the cuisine and it's understandable: when you pay at a certain price point you value the pristine over the gritty. I just wish people could appreciate what good food is, in Paris we pay euros for tightly packed restaurants and we couldn't care less because the food served is simply the best
5
Fantastic French food, the pate was to die for, the lamb was fabulous & the poached pear was outstanding - yum.
Wish there was something like this in Brisbane
4
We've eaten here several times now, this restaurant is great value with the option of a set price three course lunch menu. Wonderful food, good selection of wines. Be sure to reserve as it's busy at lunch time.
5
Had a dinner there on the last day of our Malay-SG trip in late Jan/early Feb with my wife and 5-year-old son. Very classy but relaxed atmosphere with very friendly waitresses. Food was excellent and the highlight must went to the desserts. The durian soufflé with mangosteen sorbet (king and queen of fruits) was to die for
4
First, don't be put off by the fact it is in a shopping mall. OK - so it's not the same atmosphere as the NYC one, but it's a lot better than it could be. I have now been quite a few times and am rarely disappointed with the food. However, I was quite disappointed with the fries. If you' re making your name on your burgers, you would expect pretty special fries to go with them. Hand cut and freshly made at least. Last night, they were clearly of the mass produced, tasteless, frozen version (and the restaurant didn't deny when I pointed it out). This just seemed a bit bizarre considering the rest of the menu. Service is generally very good though and it's pretty good value for money
4
Arrived earlier than booked time. Got 2 phone calls while I was eating from the restaurant as they were checking on my reservations! Food was great. Had black truffle fois gras terrine, Louisane Gumbo, which were 2 specials for the day. Had no room for dessert. However, the waitress put down a plate of hot mini Madelines. That was a nice gesture. I couldn't finish. So they packed in a tiny handbag box. Cute. If I need to fault anything, I would prefer a smaller bottle of still or sparkling water. They only have 750 ml or a little. Food was rather on the pricey side but worth it.
4
The restaurant is taken place in the Marina Bay Sands and we found it by accident as we just walked around and wanted to have a nice dinner not far from our hotel (Marina Bay Sands).The price is okay and the food too, but for the money you sepnd, you are better off somewhere else in the city
3
We had the fixed price three course menu including a glass of wine and complimentary bread. The food was good, not great and I don't think worth the price. However, the atmosphere and setting was like being in a Parisian bistro which was nice. I wouldn't pay those prices again though.My pasta bolognese was overly salted, and void of all the taste of a good bolognese, whilst the veal breast was very dry and really quite average
5
Every time I go to DB I wonder if it will be as amazing as the last time and every time I go they delight and surprise me with and an even better experience. It simply is the best all round restaurant in Singapore.It helps that it has the best staff in any restaurant not just in Singapore but the world (and I've eaten at thousands of restaurants in dozens of countries). Led by GM Chris Williams and ably helped by Sommelier Alvin who knows everything about wine, front of house manager Stacie who is forever looking glamorous and smiling and master-chef Jonathan who creates and designs the most amazingly delicious meals based on the DB brand.DB is always the place we go when we need great food, great drinks, great service, smiling and accommodating staff and when we need that certainty of a perfect night. It never lets us down. I recommend it as highly as I can
5
My sister and I managed to get a table without making prior reservations. We decided to give db a try since we always frequent Mozza on our trips to Marina Bay Sands. We had the "wild mushroom soup" and "Boston lobster salad" for appetizers. Both were really good. We shared the "original db burger" which was excellent. Service was prompt and attentive. I will definitely visit again
4
Although having made a reservation our party of three was shown to a small table which quite frankly was far too small! We ordered three dishes, namely the house burger, the seafood casserole and country pate. We informed the attentive staff that we would be sharing the dishes. However, they were all served at the same time and due to the size of the table we had to eat the pate as our last dish. This in my view was not very clever on the part of the serving staff.The food, however, was of good quality and the portions are reasonable in size. The prices are reasonable.We will return as other dishes on the menu appear tempting
4
Went for a business lunch and had a great 2 course meal. The DB Burger was excellent, and the restaurant setting is good, with attentive service
4
Went for burger night with friends and we might have been a little raucous for the posh-ish setting but they had prompt service and good food and value for money, totally stuffed after one burger order!
5
The food was very tasty, good selection of wine and a perfect intimate ambiance. Poor value for money, good location and good service. Can be crowded during the evening, you may need a reservation. I will visit again when in Singapore.
2
Usually one of my favorite leisure hang-outs. Nice atmosphere, nice decor, convivial bar tenders and an excellent Maître D' to run the show. Furthermore this Friday evening, Chef Boulud himself was in the premises. We hot a bit excited but surprisingly enough he didn't bother stopping at tables for a chat or introduction. Worse, while he was cruising between the kitchen and "la salle" we've been served the worst ever meal. Salmon way over cooked. Foie gras au torchon barely the consistency of an army pâté. The Tenderloin not so tender. A poor experience indeed. Chef Boulud, review your ingredients selection and pay a closer attention to food preparation. This is what I would have appreciated telling you in person.A faithful client
5
We stopped here for just a quick drink at the bar. But looking at the menu we decided to share their 'Yankee Burger' with beef patty, iceberg lettuce tomato, onion and served on a sesame bun. This was one of the best burgers we have ever eaten. It was made from fresh produce and tasted wonderful. The beer and wine were both excellent. The modern décor and very clean toilets make this restaurant a pleasure to recommend. The staff were all very attentive without being in your face. A good location in the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall

Any DB restaurant is going to be good and this one is no exception. Excellent, interesting and superbly prepared and plated cuisine. The service was very attentive. If I was being really picky, my preference would be that the staff don't clean up the table so fast. It feels like you're being rushed (just a little) when you'd prefer to stay a little longer - perhaps for another cocktail. That's a very minor point though. I highly recommend this restaurant for a great dining experience

We went to the Bistro after my partner had a win at the nearby Casino and prior to seeing a performance of Cats at the theatre located across from the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant was very impressive and despite not having a reservation we were quickly seated. We both ordered the Frenchy burger and it was delicious: definitely the most expensive burger we have ever ordered but also the most tasty! Prior to receiving the burgers we were offered a range of freshly baked breads and some wonderful house baked cheese puffs which were fantastic. The burgers were served with salad and fries and a little tray containing aioli, ketchup and chilli sauce. The staff were very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. This is an expensive restaurant but we could see this before we entered and as the Casino winnings paid for it, we didn't mind! I would like to return to visit and taste some of their more upmarket menu selections as the meals we saw on other tables looked wonderful

Wife and I decided to try out DB at Marina Bay Sands for brunch. A 3 course for SGD60 per pax including a drink. Grapefruit drink was alright - nothing special. My wife's onion soup was excellent. Not too creamy and rich in flavour. The olive bread to dip the soup was just great. My starter pate was tasty too. We had croque madame and db burger for mains. Both were excellent and came in huge portions. We were stuffed already at this stage but we marched on for dessert. The crepe was well done - light and fluffy. The Molton chocolate cake was just perfect. Rich chocolate oozed out as I cut it opened. A great brunch on any Sunday!

We were 3 adults and 2 children. They have a great, though expensive, kids menu and a reasonably priced adults menu. The duck pate did not meet expectations but the burgers were terrific. Mine came out medium rare as ordered. The complimentary bread and cheese puffs were well received. A surprisingly good location for adults wanting a nice meal along with kids

Ok,so it's in a very upmarket mall,and that's a downside if you allow it to be.Service was exceptional.All the food was excellent,with the exception of the salmon which was somewhat dry.We had,between us,snails: onion soup:pate en croute:veal:duck confit and the salmonSauvignon Blanc from NZ and Merlot from Napa.Sure,it's not cheap but,come on,you know where you are before you book and its a detailed and clear website.We will go there agai

Quite liked the seafood platter and the burger. Can give it a try when you are at the Marina Bay Sands area. But it's not too cheap.
5
Great ambience in this restaurant , where people arrive in all forms of attire and are greeted equally. Food was first class and service similar. Another "must" in restaurant dining in Singapore.
5
likes the ambience n design...the crowd...
price on the above average side.
tried their seafood platter which was really impressive!
very good service staff

This was my first restaurant in Singapore since about 5-6 years. We were here with colleagues. Meals were really good, service perfect. They have a nice bar where you can just wait, relax and enjoy a drink when you wait for your party to arrive.
5
As a Chef I really recommend this place.
The Waitress was fantastic so the Sommelier.
Food, we had the Foie Gras, nicely cooked. The Specials nicely presented.
Overall a great experience. Kudos to All of you

The ambiance was elegant and enticing. The service was exceptional (someone stopped by our table every few minutes to check on how we were doing); however, the food wasn't very memorable. We got the prix fixe menu and the butternut squash soup was decadent, but the salmon was dry and bland. My friend was really excited about the sirloin burger with spare ribs, but that also wasn't as good as anticipated. I have had plenty of $100 meals at other restaurants that were more worth the money.
4
Went there with the family on a Friday evening and just as well we made a reservation. The place was packed.My family ordered their Frenchie Burger and Yankee Burger and they enjoyed it.I had their db Burger. This is a Sirloin Burger which is filled with Braised Short Ribs & Foie Gras and served on a Parmesan Bun. Requested for a medium and was cooked to perfection. The meaty taste of the sirloin burger paired perfectly with the buttery, mild liver tasting melt in your mouth foie gras was just perfect.All burgers come with a side of fries.Service was top notch. Our server was ever attentive and explained each menu option in detail. Would definitely go back there again to sample their other menu option

We have eaten twice in this restaurant within one week. One lunch and one dinner. Excellent service and good food. However the prices are very expensive, on some courses outrageous. Being from Norway - the country competing with Switzerland every year to be the worlds most expensive - we are used to high prices. However this is even much more expensive than in Norway. In addition the food is not super great - so value for money is poor.Atmosphere is also great. They did offer a good kids menu and seemed flexible to accommodate the kids. Our feeling is, as with everything in Marina Bay, you are paying a lot money for very mediocre stuff. They charge extreme prices just because it is part of the Marina Bay complex. That would have been fine if things were exceptional, but they are not.Despite great service and atmosphere we will not go back if we can avoid it. We hate having a nice meal and then feeling screwed when you see the bill..

This is one of the "celebrity" restaurants in the extravagent Marina Bay Sands development so i was a bit unsure on quality v price. I should not have worried, this is a restauant based on french traditions if good ingredients, excellent presentation and interesting combinations. The seafood casserole was excellent and the protiteroles really well presented and delicious. There was about a twenty minute wait when i arrived, which i was able to jump by eating at the bar.Really good for a lunch, i would expect a delight for a long dinner

First time I went there was valentines this year. Heard lots of hype about the place but it was somehow disappointing. This round due to overbooking of restaurants over the festive season and my mom in law was in town I had sort of no choice and to book this place again. I took 20 mins to look at the menu. Asked for help from staff and they spoke with heavily accented Filipino english which I was struggling to understand. Food turned out good this time though the staff should learn to communicate with each other better and speak better english
2
The food is pretty normal and not as tasty as I thought it will be.
I had been to many fine dining restaurants before and this place is probably not up to standard.
Tried once and I won't be going back.
5
Unknown to me but what a happy experience. Great choice for lunch - set menu, brunch or a la carte. Excellent food, good wine AND staff whose smiles actually reach their eyes. Who can ask for more when resting between visits.
4
The wine here is outrageously expensive, but look past the wine list to the dinner menu and you will find fantastically crafted burgers that were very delicious.
1
This was the worst meal I had in a long time. After eating a DB Bistro Moderne I was sick with the stomach flu for 3 days. Not a nice vacation in Singapore. The salmon was not cooked. The waiter said that it was normal, no it is not. You need to cook salmon. They returned it to kitchen and cooked the salmon this time but it was tasteless. My recipe is much better. Bad experience, loud people, bread not good. Would never go back. And was so upset to be sick. And this restaurant is very expensive, too much when it taste nothing and you are sick
4
We ate here twice, the waiters don't write down your order which resulted in first visit forgotten side order, not a problem as food was very good and we weren't charged for it. The second time the food was equally as good and the side order remembered, maybe because it was not as busy as first time. Just a minor complaint was that we had ordered a bottle of wine, we didn't finish it and it wasn't offered us to take away. Didn't detract from the evening though as the service was very good
3
The food is really good but definitely not up to a 3 or 2 star michelin chef. I understand it is a bistrot and not the chef eponym restaurant but the fact that Daniel Boulud is an ex 3 stars michelin chef is well advertised so you expect he will delivered ;) I had the famous DB burger with foie gras and extra truffle and yes it was really yummy !!! other dishes are just good but nothing special, chips are not even home made.The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated, staff was nice but prices of wine are far too expensive.
4
DB's celebrity chef, Daniel Boulud, lost his 3rd Michelin Star this year, as the Michelin Guide cited the inconsistency of his namesake restaurant. Similarly this Singapore outpost can give you great flavors or average food (which then makes it an expensive place to dine). Came for dinner. Had the crispy pork belly for appetizer. It was pretty good, but nothing exceptional, meaning I could have had it somewhere else for a lower price. Then had the signature burger with foie gras. I actually liked this one, particularly how they were able to put the foie gras in the middle of the burger without it falling apart. The burger is a bit salty hence you can easily miss the taste of the foie gras. However I do have to give plus points for how they integrated the foie gras into the patty. I also had some of their chef specials for that night. I had seared scallops which were very fresh and tasted really good. For dessert I had the Black Forest which was very interesting, but again, nothing exceptionally special. Which again makes it relatively expensive. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Nice ambience, good wait staff. Just a bit overpriced. I prefer the DB Bistro outlet in Las Vegas than this one as the Vegas one is more consistent with their food.

Came here to have pre-movie dinner. Was extremely packed. Ordered their signature db burger S$40+ add S$10 for a glass of red wine. The burger came with fries and 3 dips. Was very disappointed with the burger. It was rather dry and not very flavourful but the red wine was very drinkable. Service was swift. Dinner party of 4 felt thirsty after but not sure was food related
3
Had a desperate burger craving and ended up at DB as seemed to have a 'high end' burger on the menu and wanted something better than Mc Donalds. 2x Freuchie bruger was ordered. While waiting had some nice fresh pretzel bread and ended up being the highlight of the food experience.. Burger came and was served with fries, but no mayo available and sauces nothing to get thrilled about. Lower part of the bun soaked in some tomato relish and didn't work at all, meat Ok tasty but else nothing that will make me come back for the burger. Place is nice and service good, and they probably do have something good on the menu, just not burgers.

This my third time here (Oct, 15 2014), always get good welcome and good service except this time, we(me n husband)'ve got this quite mean waiter, he offered us a wine list (which i don't know that a drink list also) and i said no, since we are a tourist, we don't want get drunk and we not really know how to choose a wine, and suddenly this waiter making a not respect face in front of us...i'm a bit confused since he not offered us a drink list (twice there and they firstly offered a drink list before we choose the food) until we finish choosing menu this waiter not giving us any drink list, finally he gave it after i ask for it, of course with that "need a punch" face...I ordered a striploin and that's horrible !!! It's like charcoal !!! Not like what i get when the second time i was there (same menu, same medium well). For a S$ 78 steak that's really a big disappointment, at least i got save by their apple strudel and pork belly but that's it i think i'll not go back again when i visit Singapore, just because i'm not wearing a fine expensive clothes and not buying their wine i've got no respect at all even though i pay for their (expensive) food not just begging...
2
Food is so so, service is good but manager is mean. Booking for 12, 11 presents but charge 85 dollars for missing person even after many wine bottles and extra charge for foie gras. Noisy room.
Black listed now.

love the food there..the ambiance..very profesionnal staff..
Like hanging out there on sunday lunch when I m not in a brunch mood !
4
people usually go here for their DB burger, but for me i like it just the normal cheese burger.
and the cocktails are also very good, services never disappoint.
what else you can ask for.
4
Nice atmosphere, very good service and food came beautifully presented. Had the db burger and while it was ok, it probably wasn't worth the 42sgd I paid for it. We also had the set lunch which was good value.
4
Pros
(1) good service
(2) good kids' menu
(3) duck hash was good
Cons
(1) wine was expensive and not very good
(2) burger was so so
5
I have always enjoyed the food and ambience here. This is exactly what you imagine a Daniel Boulud restaurant is and how you imagine the food looks and tastes.

DB Bistro s in Marina Sands Shoppes along w other restaurants o various cuisine. It s set up by Michelin chef, Tony Boulud n it's menu s varied t suit each individual taste.We ordered a starter that was presented w froi gras, sausage, parmasan ham w djion mustard, vinigered mustard n other sauces that u can request. T platter s ard S$40 n a generous spread o various fresh flavor o breads r served. T wine s on t high side so we had beer instead n water for my teenager son. We usually celebrate our family birthdays in one o t renowned restaurants locally o worldwide. Our main course was Ribeye sirloin steak medium rare, grilled crispy on t outside, juicy soft in t inside n melt in yr mouth when u savior it slowly w yr diff flavored mustard. It s so moist n succulent u jst don't want yr meat b reduced ha ha! Value for money ard S$68 n o cuz u can choose a bigger cut n t px goes up! Bt for a single pax S$68 was more than enuf to satisfy yr carnivorous craving. My son ordered lamb w mint n it s done abit Arabic w different mix o spices. A gd flavor.Being a seafood connoisseur I spoilt myself w t seafd mix o lobster, big prawn, squid n fresh fish - value for money o ard S$46 cuz it was firm n fresh tho O my cholesterol oops! T waiters r courteous n full o service always enquire how u r enjoyg yr morsels. T finale came - t Taiwanese LA Asst.

Tq all n esp Tony Boulud who s enjoyg hs new born child bk Hme. Merci once agn n it s money well spent ! Trie Bien. Any more new menu .... I m coming bk again

Visited DB for lunch with a friend which was quite busy so we had to sit at the bar instead of the tables. Staff were very pleasant. Our orders came quite fast considering how packed it was. My friend enjoyed their famous burger with foie gras inside and the beef wrapped around it was juicy and tender.
5
We really enjoyed our dinner at DB, the dÃ©cor is luxurious and comfortable. All our wait staff were friendly and professional, making sure we were looked after. The menu was well balanced, with something for everyone to choose from. The food was delicious, well cooked with fresh ingredients. Would love to return again
4
Nice classy but relaxed environment. Kids friendly and totally comfortable without the stuffiness of restaurants serving the same standards of food. There's also kids menu but these are really for toddlers in terms of serving portion, older kids with bigger appetites need to order from the normal menu. Had the Saturday brunch set which is well executed and unpretentious - food cooked simply but definitely with high standards. Desserts were also awesome. The macaroons were quite on par with the best in Singapore. I must go back again soon
1
I had a burger there with a friend on a Sunday. We were charged 150 SDG for 2 burgers + 2 soft drinks. The French fries were frozen, not good. Avoid this place until they change their ratio price/quality.
5
my favorite restaurant in Singapore.
the food and the cervices are great.
the best hamburger in singapore
4
Ambience was great. Service was exceptional. Made us feel very welcome. If we were not rushing to catch a show, we would have loved to stay on.
5
No surprises Great Food , Great wine list and superb service. Went in for burger but settled on the NY strip with frits and my wife had the house made pasta with Shrimp Cocktail appetizers. Thoroughly enjoyed will return next month.
5
5 Yankee burgers,1 Croque Monsieur, and a bottle of rose. What a perfect lunch. However, as good as the burgers were, the Croque Monsieur won hands down! Luke's still makes a better burger, but nobody does Croque Monsieur like DB Bistro.
4
Four for dinner in this modern bistro, and three courses - I went for the classics - Onion soup, coq au vin, and warm madeleines for dessert. The soup was small but tasty, the coq au vin tender but too salty, but the tiny madeleines were perfect.
4
Its hard to say much when you have totally impeccable service. I think the food could have been average and we still would have enjoyed it. But the food wasn't it was good and the recommended cheese we had was absolutely perfectly served.The black spot is the coffee was nigh on undrinkable, in fact we didn't drink it. The staff kindly offered us another one but if the first one was so bad why try again.But aside form that a great place to be treated like you are in a private de

Decided to indulge while on holiday in singapore. Glad I chose here to do it. Had the lunch time 3 course meal. The soup was very smooth and flavorsome the steak for main tasty and chocolate molten lava cake for dessert heavenly! Only gripe is the $10 bottle of sparkling water. I didn't realise I would be charged that price when I said yes. Oh well.Great friendly staff who were very attentative. Super polite.
5
The Hamburgers are amazing. A great lunch time meal. I loved it so much I booked for dinner a couple of nights after. The Duck was incredible. The Lamb not quite as good but still good. We had a French Chenin red to accompany the meal which was amazing. It was also good to get out of the hustle and bustle of the main hotel area. It is not cheap, but none of the high class restaurants are in the Marina Bay Sands, but you pay for Quality
5
Group of five, celebrated one of our mates birthday. Great service by the crew, almost have a personal wait staff attending to us. Food is sumptious, we had the tiered cold seafood platter, with fresh seafood served before us, fresh like the fish market except served in a restaurant. Wine pairing is not the best combination but the great company made up for it. Duck confit, lobster pasta and the roast chicken is definitely a must-try! Love the heated plates and changing of new plates with each course. We ended off with chocolate souffle it is a great night and do hastag them #dbbistro on Instagram, social media works for them :
3
A very attentive staff was serving us, great service. The food we ordered were on the salty side, the special line-reel tuna which cost SGD40 and the salmon dish with corn which cost about SGD32(?). Atmosphere as expected of a fancy restaurant.
4
Nothing to complain about, perfect service, perfect food and lovely atmosphere just such a shame its in a shopping centre.
5
Really nice ambiance with excellent service.. The food was fantastic as well.. The duck confit has so much texture with it's crispy skin, succulent meat and soft fats as well..

After living for 7 years in Singapore, we’ve gotten a bit hesitant to try new fine dining restaurants. So many get glowing reviews but the food is mediocre, the service awkward, and prices sky high. We don’t mind high prices if we have a great experience, and, we’re happy to say, DB Bistro was a great experience.Hubby and I walked in at 10 PM with no reservations on a Friday night after a show. The place was hopping. We thought we might have to wait but were seated immediately. The service staff was professional and attentive. Our drink orders were taken immediately and brought to the table in a trice: a dirty martini for Sir and champagne for me. Sir was very happy with his drink. Looking at the menu, we were sorry we didn’t have more of an appetite: charcuterie plate, foie gras, and terrine; two different deluxe burgers; slow roasted salmon – but we ended up ordering coq au vin and roast lamb. Sir had a glass of full bodied Shiraz with his lamb and I had the more restrained Sangiovese, both highly potable. The dinners came with perfect timing, not too fast, not too slow and hot (but not from sitting under the lights for too long). Both dishes were perfectly cooked. The lamb was treated tenderly and the ratatouille on the side was the best I’ve ever tasted. The sauce on the chicken was rich and complex and the pearl onion still had some crunch. We finished with a cheese plate, more bubbles for me, and Rittenhouse rye on the rocks for Sir. Throughout our meal the staff stopped at our table to chat a little which made us feel at home. The bill came to $340 and we felt we got what we paid for. Rarely have we enjoyed a meal so much in Singapore. DB Bistro will become a regular haunt of ours

Have always been a fan of Daniel Boulud when I was living in NYC and his outlet in Singapore didn't disappoint me. We went for brunch and the simple croque Monsieur was to die for!! My friend had the 3 course lunch and everything was good too
4
We had a light lunch here and it was quite pleasant.The staff were attentive and service efficient. We shared a entree and had a salad with walnuts and blue cheeses dressing as our main course.The food was good but the blue cheese dressing was quite strong. Enjoyed a NZ wine with the meal. I was on the pricey side but that is Expected in Si gap ore.We did enjoy the experience so we would recommend
2
Popped in here for a quick lunch... chose the burgers and were very specific with what we wanted. (one with only cheese and one with only onion)The one with onions was delivered to the table dripping in some sort of relish so was sent back.A few minutes later the plate came out again... they had simply replaced the bun and scraped the burger... it still had traces of the relish on it.There was little interest in customer service and it was incredibly pricy for what it was. I would not recommend
3
Stumbled across this restaurant having just arrived in Singapore.My family and I were dressed quite casually. I felt that we were given funny looks from some staff members.Having said that the food was good possibly a little overpriced. I wouldn't return to the restaurant if I went back.
3
Knowing the DB restaurants in NYC my expectations were high. Compared to the Bistro Moderne in NYC, this one has better seatings and more light. Staff is friendly,not pushy. Good wine list at reasonable prices (NYC prices are lower). Steak tasted good, but the DB burger was a bit disappointing. Total bill for 5 persons, incl. 1 bottle of wine, no coffee amounts up till S$ 500+
2
Love his restaurants in NY. I think Mr. Boulud would be very angry to see the food here bearing his name. The "tagliatelle" was ramen "pasta" stuck together in clumps with salt as a primary flavor. Something not parmesan was called parmesan cheese. Maybe he thinks the clientele here in Singapore will not know the difference, and doesn't care if merely using his name makes money, but it was embarrassing
5
The shrimp appetizer and onion soup were delicious! The service was great!! The ambience was fun with great music playing softly in the background.
4
Great restaurant in a mall . Bravo !!
The salmon was nicely crispy , the Niçoise salad and the blue cheese salad was great . Just one question why Lyon food because no pork on the menu .
5
WOW!!!! I don't think there is much more we can say. The New York burger was incredible, I was sad when the burger was gone and we even considered going back the next day. Make sure you eat here when you visit Singapore!
4
Great place for French cuisine in Singapore. The dishes were on point with their NY counterparts. However the snapper I had was a little over cooked. All the other dishes were very good.
5
I dropped in to the DB Bistro for Sunday lunch on spec and I was very impressed. It's a nice setting with a French bistro feel, but lots of space. The staff were a delight: friendly, attentive and helpful. The menu looks pretty comprehensive with lots of dishes I'd like to try, but it was their signature DB Burger which caught my eye. I tend not to order burgers in restaurants unless they're a speciality and this one is undoubtedly a speciality, being stuffed with foie gras and confit rib and served on a parmesan bun. I have to say it was probably the best burger I've had in years. Even if you're not a burger fan this one is worth trying because it's truly delicious. I shall undoubtedly be back
5
Normally I would not eat a hamburger, but as it wAs the chefs special, we ordered, wow it is amazing the amount of taste they got into a hamburger, but it is truly an amazing experience. My husband had the large one $42 and I had the smaller one @ $27. I looked around the restaurant and noticed that virtually everyone had ordered one of their burgers. Total cost includes 1 glass wine, beer and 1 serve garlic snails, 2 burgers $150 approx. expensive, but worth it!. Would we come back, YES, we came here some time ago and had the chefs special burger with truffles approx $58, amazing
5
Walked in with no reservations & yet the staff were very friendly & very helpful.Provided table in 45mins & there is a lot to do in MBS Mall while waiting for 45mins.Waiters/Waitress were out of this world…best service in Singapore.Extensive Wine selection & the Food is just awesome…best steak in SingaporeMust tryBOSTON LOBSTER SALADESCARGOTS PERSILLADESEARED FOIE GRASNEW YORK STRIPI will be back soon…just one area to work on, tables were a little smal
3
This was our 4th visit and will be the last. it's just not special anymore. Tables are tiny, menu is pretty boring and the food is just mediocre (even the signature burger) and no way is worth the high prices they charge. I really think its slipped over the years and we had much experiences in previously. I would much rather go to Garibaldi's etc pay similar money and feel its worth every penny
4
We went there for dinner on a Friday by 8.30. The restaurant was busy and we felt it as the service was a bit slow, But the team is friendly which is becoming rare in Singapore.We started with the foie gras and the escargot: the foie gras is excellent, the escargot were good.Then, we tried the steak tartare: very good and the coq au vin was a bit too dry. We drank some sparkling Loire which was good and refreshing.The ambiance is nice and you quickly gorget you are in a big mall in S'pore.Prices are good. It's a a good address for lunch and dinner
5
A busy few days of work gave me a quiet break on lunchtime.I hopped onto the MRT to Marina Bay Sands and knowing the complex, headed up to level 2 and my favourite Lyonnaise bistro outside France.Daniel Buloud's wonderful bistro, set aside the glamour of a large airy Asian mall with expensive designer shops, is somewhat a contrast in styles and cultures.Yet his cuisine cooked under executive chef Jonathan Kinsella, is a fabulous mix of classic French cooking with fresh and vibrant Asian flavours.My solo lunch, with no booking was simply delicious.The pork terrine was luscious in porkiness with fresh cornichons and a dressing sharp and tangy.My crispy skin salmon with rich, almost hot tomato sauce with baby potatoes and olives was simply to die for.The homemade madeleines with coffee were exquisite.Overall, for a fixed price menu of SG$42 for 2 courses plus the one glass of Macon Villages Chardonnay and coffee was great value for the service and the highest level of cooking - tres bon
4
Their burger with foie gras is amazing. My partner had the lamb chops which were also very good. A bit expensive but a good meal
5
Great service but menu was a bit thin. The burgers seems popular although I tried other items on the menu that were wonderful. Lots of seating and a good wine list.
5
I loved their bouillabaisse! I came back a second time to try their famous foie gras burger. Too heavy didn't particularly enjoy it but I have to admit it was well made for those who are fans of foie gras.

Just underneath the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a huge shopping mall. I hate shopping malls. But I was attracted by a long walk and hot weather and air conditioning and no other food joints. The mall from the outside is nothing. But inside it is huge. The restaurants is "faux Parisien". Get over that and it is quite nice. Nice service. Good enough food. Good wine list and nice little beer list as well. Very nice and kind staff. Not the usual Singapore.

Came here alone for lunch on Sunday afternoon around 1pm. The restaurant was quite empty, only less than 10 tables were seated. The reception insisted I should sit at the bar because I was alone. They refused to seat me at a table. I told her it would be better as the restaurant looked more occupied and I actually had a back ach recently, hence I prefer to sit at a table. They refused. I ended up in the restaurant next door, Mario Bataly, which was almost full. After lunch at 230pm, I walked pass db bistro and noticed the restaurant was still quite empty and not fully seated. I just can't understand the logic. I hope the restaurant can reply this review and give a good explanation for their decision to reject a guest for insisting to sit at a table when the restaurant is not full

Just across from the mastercard theatre of MBS, we wanted a really quick pre-theatre meal and we only had 30mins. Settled on the 2 course since that appeared to be the fastest. It even came with a house white or red! My friend ordered a nicoise salad and salmon main. I ordered a lamb main and cheese. I know they wanted to coordinate the mains, but it caused a little bit of time stress when i watched my friend had his salad, and i had to rush through my cheese. Apart from the coordination issue, all our portions are large for a pre-theatre set, which was impressive. And they were good too - my lamb and cheese (especially the bread that came with it). Service was coorperative , knowing that we were rushing to get to the theatre. Not bad at all, and good value at $58 for 2 courses and a wine
4
Love the DB and French burger, including the dips that comes with it! Great service, lovely location (especially good for pre-theatre quick dinner fix and post-theatre dessert cravings)!Other dishes on the menu were more misses than hits, with overly salty french onion soup and chocolate dessert that can definitely tone down on the intensity.But overall an enjoyable place for a meal, and is comparably more value for money than the other restaurants that decorate the entire MBS
4
We only ended up here because the restaurant we wanted to go to was full. I was disappointed but I sure am glad we ended up here. The staff were friendly and helpful with both food menu and the wine list. The dishes we had were delicious and the wine list is extremely impressive. For foodies this is a good place to stop when at Marina Bay Sands
3
We had a dinner event in April 2014 for my valued customers. We blocked half of the restaurant. The staff were very attentive and well informed about each of the customer's menu selection.Before we selected this restaurant, they are not very flexible in our needs and we have to oblige to spend a certain committed amount. It can be quite taxing for us too.Hope they can improve this area to be more flexible to hear our needs.Food, atmosphere, attentive staff were there. Afterall, my customers were happy
5
The food was great. I chose a dish I would never normally have and I loved it! The service was also excellent - I have had too many experiences of terrible service in Singapore especially in higher end establishments that has put me off but at DB the staff were very attentive, well informed, friendly and help to make a very good meal even better. My son loved the kids menu and had a very good burger. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and go again
5
great place and seafood platter a must, as well as some traditional dishes with a good glass of wine.
4
Food nice and fresh, we order organic chicken nice but little bit salty and Rib eye very nich and salmon also fresh and pork burger normal.
5
This place is excellent!
I went twice, first time on my own seated at the bar.
Attentive service, yummy frenchie burger and cocktail.
The second time went with a friend and had the set menu. Great selection, yummy food, good value. Highly recommend
4
Despite the shopping mall surrounds, had an excellent meal here. 3 courses of Niçoise salad, snapper and then a terrific chocolate soufflé. Not cheap but prices are very similar to mainland Australia and food and service are high quality

We spoiled our selves and went for a romantic dinner.The meal was ok nothing special.The first waitress was really lovely half way through our meal her shift ended and we got a young man who was not as nice.The meal was not out of this world - I was expecting food that was to die for.The presentation was excellent but the rest was average.Disappointing considering the cost.We were thinking it would have been more romantic
3
Been here three times. Love the foie gras terrine. It's absolutely delightful. Like most of the appetizers, but the mains are not to my liking. Coq-Au-Vin is certainly not the way it should be. They should just describe it has Braised chicken with red wine sauce. Twice, the dessert of our choice (tart) was not available. Service is just average. Pernod is SGD28 ! The most expensive we've ever paid in our lives. Perhaps will return--next year

If you are shopping like crazy or attending a conference at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore this is a good place to take stock, relax and have lunch. Located amongst the "shoppes" in the Marina Bay Sands complex, db is apparently an offshoot of a NYC restaurant of the same name (I am not familiar with the original). Welcomed by a very smooth Matre 'd, I was offered a choice of bar or table dining and opted for the latter. Time poor, I ordered a single course, glass of wine and coffee. The salmon main was very tasty and an ideal portion size (not too big or too small) - a touch oily however but that is very often the case. A limited but good selection of quality wines by the glass. Matre 'd is very professional - just the right amount of contact to make you feel welcome without the forced conversation that is often involved. The restaurant was busy and deservedly so and service was efficient

Recommended restaurant from Marina Bay Sands Hotel, this French/ American restaurant was heavily booked, so we didn't get in till late.The "American" tag worried me a bit, but the food was excellent; as good as most meals I have eaten in Paris and better than many. It was a bistro-style place, so romance was not the main focus.Service was great. An entree which was too heavily salted was immediately returned to the kitchen and replaced with a far better tasting dish within minutes. Dessert was superfluous but still enjoyed greatly. Then we were given a plate of freshly made (still warm) Madelines which were packed into a takeaway container to take home. They were still delicious with coffee 24 hours later
2
Overpriced food and wine, mediocre service - no wonder the place seems always empty... even on really busy days when nearby places are packed, DB Bistro remains more than three quarters empty... clearly people are voting with their feet. It's an easy miss and a huge disappointment when compared to Daniel Boulud's other ventures
4
we were stranded in MBS with nowhere to eat. we wanted to go to the place next door but it was a 45 minutes wait. so we came here and was surprised by the friendliness of the service and some of the best pastas ever. dessert was also mouthwatering. not so keen on the hamburger though. i expected a bit more from the legendary new yorker burger. anyway, it was easy, convenient and good. would want to go back and try some other stuffs on the menu
5
Great service and a great menu - food is well presented and cooked to perfection. The Steaks were exceptional and I mean exceptional. Great selection of wine - and excellent service. Highly recommend it.
5
Tried the DB burger this time, best ever! Menu is very good so it is a hard choice. My wife had the salmon, also good. Will be back to try more on the menu.
2
Terrible food massivley overpriced. French cuisine, what a joke. Ordered the escargo, tiny & not even in shells & the foie gras was greasy & overcooked.
5
We had a very nice time, we felt we were VIPs, the people were all incredibly great (thanks to dennis, et al) and the food was exceptionally delicious. It is, IMHO, the best dining option in the marina bay sands complex.
3
We came to DB Bistro after arriving late from very long flights and not having reservations anywhere. Given its location, appearance and price for what could/should be a great meal, we were a little disappointed. Food was good but not great and service was less than perfect. If the prices were slightly less, it would be well worth it. All that being said, they were very friendly with my family and we had a good time. Would probably not return given the quality of other restaurants near by for the same cost
5
This was our second time and we had (again) a great dinner. The place is well managed, service was impeccable, very pro yet friendly. Food was perfect. We had oysters and then the bouillabaisse with I highly recommend (with a glass a rosÃ© wine from Provence).
4
Crazy hard to find location in a hotel/casino/mall that lacks any character and charm of Singapore...could be in Vegas or Dubai... But the burger albeit crazy expensive was worth it as I was hungry as heck after 30 minute search for the place! Other items mere so-so
2
We had a reservation for a party of 6 prior to seeing a show at the theatre at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes. The restaurant was not crowded it was 3:30 p.m. and we could select from the "brunch" set menu or from the regular menu. I had dined here previously had a good experience. I selected from the brunch "Set Menu", appetiser, main dish, dessert & drink. Orders were taken, drinks served and appetisers. While I was still eating my appetiser a waiter brought over my dessert! We of course sent him away. Several minutes later the chap that took our order came over to me & said he was very sorry they were out of the main course I had selected. I would have to choose something else. I only chose the set menu because of that 1 items so I was upset that it took 30 minutes for them to tell me this. In the end I was able to select something off the menu and substitute. I ordered a burger medium-well. It came rare and was pink all over. No one could explain why my dessert was brought after the appetiser or why I was informed about my main course being unavailable for 30 minutes after ordering. In keeping with Singapore customer service standards I was not offered anything free, nor was my meal comped. In the end what I ordered was less expensive then the original main course, it was not cook properly and I was charged full price! Never did we see the manager or get an apology from him/her. All 6 adults came away from that meal with absolute shock and disbelief at how little the customer means to this establishment. The restaurant was not crowded and there was no excuse for the lack of customer service. The food is good, but doubt we will go again as it is not worth the price and the terrible lack of service and attention to the customer
5
Came to DB after an afternoon of shopping at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes as I was craving for the DB burger which i had here previously ! Was good we made a reservation earlier as the restaurant was quite full when we arrived from the guests who are going to the theatres later. We were greeted by the friendly reception and were quickly shown to our table which is at the bankette facing the walkway. We do like and often request for this seat as its great for people watching but still have a sense of privacy. Love the modern yet charming european decor and the lively ambience. We had the house favourite which is the DB burger. It is good everytime I have it ! We also shared the beef tartare and the fish which were very tasy and fresh. The service was attentive but discreet with a good team of knowledgeable staff. We have a positive experience everytime we are here. of course we will be back again 
3
My wife and I had a lunch here. The whole experience was very positive. The ingredients are all high quality and the staff are very courteous. The whole place has a Las Vegas feeling to it, fancy place but less than formal attire are tolerated. The whole ambiance is actually very relaxing. The food is not actually the best I ever had. But we found no problems at all whatsoever. The beef entrees are all good, comparable to Las Vegas. If you are looking for relaxing lunch with good food, this place is quite adequate
4
Went to Db for a late Valentine celebration, just a casual dining with my fiance, have a satisfying service and meal despite the busy place...
Recommend the Coq Au Vin and Beef Tartare...good
4
The food was amazing. Went with a few friends so we could order different dishes and share. The db burger is great value for money. we had to have the desserts and ordered a few so that we could try (almost) everything on the menu! had to roll out of the restaurant as my legs could not hold my weight
4
This is a perfect place for burger lovers! 3 course set lunch featuring the original fantastic db burger is S$67++ Great value for sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs and foie gras on freshly baked parmesan bun, plus starters and dessert, so yummy and indulgent. For small eater, you can opt for two-course S$42++ The Penne Albufera - fresh penne pasta with foie gras, and truffle chicken sauce is memorable and done to perfection, which you will ask for more. The service is attentive, location is central - at a premium shopping mall and decoration is tastefully luxurious. There's also a stylish bar and relaxing lounge, very NYC old world feel, using traditional french cooking to make contemporary America menu. Love it. Calling all burger lovers, it is a must- try, worth it! And they serve great beer too

If you are traveling alone, there will most likely only space at the Bar for you. If you get bread...you are lucky. I was not so lucky....Downside of the evening was the most expensive open red wine in a 5-finger high glass...I felt sorry for the E.Guigal.The portions were relatively small compared to the price.Upside was I got some Madeleines on the house. They were delicious.All in all the ladies at the entrance were very nice and friendly.So if you are not very hungry and want your food coming quick and don't care about the wine glass, then this is your place to go.If you want to be treated special as a single female traveller, keep searching....I am still searching for the place where you don't get underestimated, get a proper seat and table, get your bread, get it filled if empty, get the right wine glass proper for the wine and simple able to lean back and enjoy the evening....when will restaurants start to react...
4
Went here for second time. Service as usual was just superb. Food this time was not quite there. Can not put finger on why but it just did not taste as good as 6 months ago.Also noticed not as full as 6 months ago so it may not be just me noticing
5
Went for dinner when the place was nearly full and with out a doubt, the service is notably exceptional. This is a sharp contrast to the restaurants in Singapore that generally have disgruntled waitstaff with no positive energy to add to the dining experience. The hostesses were beautiful and hospitable, the servers were very knowledgeable and attentive, and even the managers were positive and sincere as they made the rounds to check on tables. Fallen table napkins were proactively picked up, water was actively refilled, and the servers quickly acknowledged patrons when flagged for any request. I have never experienced such phenomenal service in Singapore. As for the food, everything was delicious but as a star chef restaurant - the price is reflective of its stature. The burgers were reasonably priced compared to other places in Singapore (S$23 for the entry level burger), but the seafood was a bit pricier than other places. The appetizers were very pricey and not a good value. What was surprisingly a great value were the desserts - as they were both innovative and tasty. In short, this is great place for a business meeting or if you're on a tight schedule. It is a great place to impress a date or a business associate with options that don't necessarily burn a hole in your wallet

A quaint little French restaurant at MBS, serving excellent French food in romantic ambience and efficient service. I went back twice, and still would return for its affordable and delectable food.The duck confit is a must-try always. Duck Confit, complete with brussels sprouts marmalade, roasted potatoes, grilled sweet onions and Natural Jus. It was divine the last time I tasted it, and it was still superb now. Very crispy skin to whet one's appetite, and when one gets under the skin, the tenderness of the duck meat was almost a surprise. Taste-wise, hints of saltiness coupled with the well-blended flavors of the Jus that danced on the tongues. This dish is a keeper for sure.For more detailed information and photos, do visithttp://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-db-moderne-bistro-again.htm

Came for noon lunch.Seafood platter- as starter- with oyster,cod,jumbo prawns,mussels what to say it's refreshing,good work,:-). I chose slow cooked salmon as a main course cooked with olive oil with oregano foam and lentil puree. My opinion is that the lentil puree doesn't go well with the salmon,but the fish is well cooked :-[. The next one I went for is a classic seared foie gras with roasted apples cranberries pooled with duck juice- as the name says it's classic:-). So it's the end waiting for the desserts.here comes lychee and blueberry vacherin no comments ,will b a surprise for everyone with it's presentation and taste variations, and the next dessert is a chestnut and mandarin verrine- chestnut variations in the form of biscuits bread with mandarin variations like sorbet and segments it's also fantastic:-):-DWill come back again for dinner.recommended star chef restaurant
1
We ordered one set of Crispy pork belly, one set of New England casserole and one set of pork 'schnitzel'. All the foods only can describe in two words: very salty. The service is excellent especially when they know keeping add water for us but the foods are really unacceptable by us. I won't come back anymore when I go visit Singapore because I need protect my hair, I feel like I will losing all my hair after one meal here. Or maybe the cooker are in the bad mood on that night. So just good luck if you wish to having meal there. And the price for me is very expensive because I can't get satisfaction with the meal
5
My wife and I travel to Singapore regularly and sometimes our 2 teenagers come with us.Since discovering DB Bistro, we go there as as a couple and a family and whilst we expect the bill to be a little higher than most bistros, the quality of the food and service fully justifies it every time.We particularly took note on our 1st ever visit there, the number of diners who appeared very smart casually attired and urbanised, which is always a good sign of a quality venue.It may not suit everyone, as recent posts suggest, with places more fitting what they seek, but overall, the high praise that the majority of posts on here give, speaks for itself.Special praise to the friendly, very attentive staff that add to our experience
5
Very good atmosph! People are very friendly, service is on high proper level. Food is amazing quality as well ! I recommend everyone to try it ! Special thx to Hermes ! Awesome guy :)
4
A bit salty for my taste but otherwise excellent. Booked our table before hand to get your guaranteed table. Service was excellent!
4
Food was delicious and the service top notch - prices reasonable and the location in marina bay sands is really good
1
What a joke of a restaurant. Overpriced, very ordinary food. All hype, no substance. The french onion soup was very disappointing. Ordered a medium done DB Burger and it came out raw, can't believe they think that is worth S$42 ++. The Line-Caught Tuna a La Nicoise was ordinary and looked like my mum made it at home. There are much better restaurants in Singapore
3
i had a pre-theatre-dinner before my show, so I admit this meal was kinda rush :(to be honest, this place was not as expensive as i expected it to be, phew!but I felt sad that the portions were tiny...if i was prepared to pay top dollar for a meal at a celebrity chef restaurant...surely the portion size could have been more generous...
2
DB is a renowned chef and I have always admired his cooking style. I was so excited when we were having lunch at his cafe. We ordered a bottle of puligny Montrachet and I ordered the escargot. We shared a seafood and cold cut platters. The seafood was fresh and awesome. The cold cuts, well can't go wrong with cold cuts but my escargot was shockingly disappointing. It tasted like rubber and it was tasteless. It was not acceptable because I am eating at a famous French cafe. Perhaps is not DB's fault but his crews. My friends kept telling me is a cafe hence you can't expect much... Hello.. My answer was simply.. If you're opening an eatery..do it well otherwise don't open one! I do hope they will consider to change and make it better.
5
My wife and I had our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner here. We knew nothing about the restaurant and were lucky enough to get a table on what appeared to be a busy night.Long story short, the food was delicious and came in good portion sizes (I was well and truly full!). We had the French onion soup, the duck and the lamb, all of them were perfectly cooked and tasted fantastic with our bottle of red.It ambience is nice inside, I really like the dÃ©cor, comfortable seating and it was easy to have chat as well.We had a great time and the service was really good. We always had our water and wine topped up, the food arrived in good time and the staff were happy to have a chat to us as the place was dying down... We were having such a good night we didn't even realise we were the last 2 left in the restaurant
3
This particular restraunt has both a very eye popping interior and exterior designs great decor to compliment the theme of the restraunt. The menu has a large variety of different dishes that sound very tempting. The dish that sounds the most tempting is the Original DB burger, which is a burger with it's patty stuffed with ribs foie gras. However it does not taste as good as it sounds, unfortunately. The burgers are cooked to perfection, but.... the ribs are just too dry and the foie gras does not show either.The service is also disappointing. The waiters and waitresses are slow to respond and always show signs that thay don't give a damn, or otherwise ignore you
4
I went for an early dinner with my 2 teenage sons, promising them great burgers.We weren't disappointed.The service was attentive and swift. We had water in our glasses in minutes and my beer followed shortly after. They asked us if we were attending a show. A nice touch as I assume an affirmative response would have meant they rushed the food to us.We started off with the Tarte Flambe, a sort of mini, crispy pizza with fromage blanc cheese and bacon. Very nice indeed, with great flavours and textures!One of my sons had the Frenchie burger and my other son and I had the DB Burger. All burgers went down very well. The buns were fresh yet crunchy on the outside. The DB Burger is sirloin mince, filled with ribs and foie gras. They were coked to medium rare perfection, juicy and tasty.The french fries provided were tasty but nothing special. We focused on the burgers !My third visit to DB and the best yet combination of service and food
5
We went to Marina Bay looking to go to a top class restaurant during the Xmas period and decided on DB Bistro and we were not disappointed. We ordered the French onion soup which was delicious but with a touch too much cheese. For the mains we had the pork schnitzel and the New England casserole with both of these meals coming with sides and were decent sized portions. Overall we enjoyed our meal in a nice environment, prompt and efficient service, and a good quality meal and overall felt we received good value for money with the only exception being the price of a glass of wine which was a bit excessive.A recommended place to go and eat if you are visiting Marina Bay Sands
3
If you ever though a burger order right of the menu could be easier, well although very tasty we had to send it back twice as they kept brining me the wrong burger, and yes they still charged us for it.
5
My husband who has been to this restaurant before brought me and my kids there and he said they have the most amazing burgers - and they did!
4
We hadn't planned to eat French in Singapore - the taxi queues at the MBS Mall were long, we were tired, so we decided to stay and eat. We didn't make a mistake!I had the Coq au Vin and my partner had the Confit Duck. Both were GREAT! The service was spot on, and I appreciated the fact you could order wine by the glass, carafe, or bottle. Yes, it may be a tad pricey for some, but this was a quality meal that hit the spot.
3
We went on Wednesday for dinner. It was a birthday dinner. Onion soup was good but I did understand how they serve the rillettes. The main course: bouillabaisse was good and the tartare (MC) was too spicy and the portion ridiculous(stingy). If you want French fries or veg around your plate you have to pay. Lucky the dessert was good with a pear tart and an apple tart. They have no birthday cake ...just a small candle(stingy).The service was excellent with a smiling and efficient Korean girl
2
I really wanted to like the food here.. Mostly because I had watched a Nat Geo Special on Daniel Boulud when he was in Singapore sometime ago and did a Special Dinner at The Fullerton Hotel... Everything about him, on tv, was, to me, very impressive, and coupled with his fame and accolades up the bayou for his numerous restaurants all over, to say that I was excited about my burger meal when DB Bistro opened at MBS, would've been an understatement... Excitement, unfortunately was to become disappointment and that was not too long after they first opened, and sad to say, when I was three again just late Oct, to give the burger another shot, I walked away thinking/feeling if I should buy another one just to FedEx to Chef Boulud in NY, and ask for his honest opinion on his famed Original DB Burger because, to me, if again presented in front of me, and placed next to a BK Bacon Cheeseburger, there would be no contest and in fact, as I pen this 'review' I can actually recall the yummiest of the latter, even though I actually have not had one in probably at least a year...Price notwithstanding, a tasteless/bland burger that falls VERY far off any decent mark.. But the fact that it is far from being 'resonantly priced', just makes things worse
3
We went for a birthday dinner, some of us ordered from the prix fixe menu and others ordered a la carte. The grilled salmon was excellent, however the "pumpkin pie" was quite bizarre, it was not a pie at all but more like a dense cakey pumpkin-less torte of some sort. Not sure if the recipe was followed. The waitstaff was not as attentive as they should be at a restaurant of this caliber. Overall an unexpectedly average experience. Was hoping to be wowed
5
Service was excellent. Food was delicious. We shared the tart (bacon and onion) and then had the Duck and the Braised Beef. Both mains we stand-out dishes. We were out celebrating my daughter's graduation, and the staff went above and beyond to make it special. What a perfect night
2
Went here for the set lunch recently. Cost is $52++ for 3 courses plus an extra $15++ if you go for the DB Burger (which allows you to get a glass of wine for $10). Total cost ended up being about $90 per person all in.Food was pretty mediocre. The tuna salad looked like it had been made with canned tuna (I was expecting something more along the lines of sliced tuna, lightly seared). The burger was nothing special. The dessert was acceptable enough.The service was a little disappointing: instead of waiting until everyone had finished their starters, the table was cleared and then the sauces for the burgers served whilst some people were still eating.I won't be going back: simply not good value for money
3
We have been here twice and while the first visit was just average, we had a much better experience the second time around.Food is a little inconsistent across the menu, so your level of enjoyment in this restaurant may be dependent on what you ordered. Top notch stuff - french onion soup and the duck confit. The warm madeleines were also really good and so were the profiteroles. Unfortunately, the very much talked about DB burger was a little over-rated. It was actually a tad dry which was a bit of a let down. The Boston Lobster Salad was fresh, but a little too simplistic, especially for the price you pay for it. The reason however why the first visit was just average was mostly because of service. It was a very busy night for them and the service staff were rather stretched. As a result, service was a little slow and the service staff felt hurried, not exactly warm - mostly working towards being efficient. However on our second visit, we had an early pre-theater dinner and at this time, it was a little less crowded. And that is when the service was brilliant. Warm, attentive without being overbearing, friendly and with lots of smiles. They took care to make sure our food was out on time for our show, and clearly this was communicated to the other servers as they brought out the dishes. All in all, the ambience is lovely - a nice mix of classy without being too uppity. Gets a little noisy when its busy especially with the theatre crowd walking around outside of the restaurant but not to a negative extent
3
The Duck Salad and Pork Belly Salad for appetizers were the highlight!Scallops for main were pretty tasty and well cooked, but with only 4... I was left wanting more.Partner had the Seafood and Vegetable Aioli, which was to me, poorly presented and lacked any substance. The Aioli itself was nothing great.Service though lifted this place up! Very professional
3
Ae brunch here and ordered the burgers.
They were quite awful to be honest, i probably
Sould have ordered something else but they had a burger
Lunch promo so ordered it.
Not coming back for the burgers.
5
Top restaurant with a rather short menu but more than sufficient. All dishes are shareable for two persons, advisable. Share and bye an other dish too. Every thing goes. There are good wines and drinks. Not cheP but well worth a visit.
4
We really enjoyed our dinner here. We had the French onion soup (superb), pork belly (very good), frenchie burger was pretty tasty, and slow cooked salmon. It is rich French food, so butter and salt are prominent and it was too much food for two of us, so would order differently next time.The service staff (Katie) was exceptional - friendly, helpful and knowledgable. Worth another visit just for the French onion soup
5
French brasseries are part of the food landscape in France and everywhere in the world. I went 3 times to Daniel Boulud Singapore outlet in the last 16 months. And these are probably my 3 best dinners in Singapore over the same period. The DB Burger (a mix of beef and braised pork is unique. As to the duck confit (Confit de Canard) is by best ever (yes I repeat MY BEST EVER), crispy, tender, juicy, tasty everything is there.The profiterole with Dolce de latte ice cream gets only a 8/10 because the chocolate covers the i taste of the ice cream.I keep the best for the end: The staff. Those guys are just perfect, the attention, the timing for the dishes. We could imagine the hours of training behind. But they are perfect because they do it with heart, with smile. A lot of attention but no pressure felt.The chef came to the room to visit a table of guests from France which was next to mine. I could feel the passion in what he was saying.Congratulations to DB and thumbs up to the staff - Michel aka Travelstar Spor

Singapore can be very expensive. There are either the restaurants or the cheap street eats. Both are worth a try. Shopping seems to run along the same lines. This was a lovely restaurant and the food we ordered was excellent. I had the Scottish salmon with veges and my husband had the Frenchie burger with the salad and serve of fries in a metal cup. Both meals were delicious. Wine, always very expensive in Singapore, can be ordered by the glass or in a smaller taster glass. The service was also excellent. It was one of our more enjoyable nights where you pay extra to have a sit down meal with great service
5
This is one of the highly publicised celebrity restaurants within the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes.It's a modern bistro style restaurant, offering excellent friendly and attentive service.I went there for lunch- it appears to be a popular business restaurant.They offer a Prix Fixe lunch: SGD 42 for 2 courses; SGD 52 for 3 courses. If you want their signature burger (apparently one of their most popular dishes) it's another SGD 15. By the way, the signature burger includes foie gras- accounting for the price!I enjoyed my lunch- it was not inexpensive, but the overall combination of food, beverage, service and ambience was excellent.They have an excellent- if expensive- wine list.Highly recommende

Not typical for a fancy fine dining establishment but hey they prominently promote themselves as a gourmet burger destination.I had the Frenchie burger while my friend had the Yankee burger ( think that's what it was called) the issue with their burger was which my friend echoed too was that they seemed to have high quality ingredients but they didn't come together well. The Frenchie for example had a slice of pork belly which particularly did not blend with the rest of the concoction or enhance it any way. Also never have I had a great burger in a place where they ask you how would you like your patty done, a burger patty is not a steak and since the chef has put together the offering the house should go with what they think goes best, they can have different burgers for those who like it rare v/s those who like it well done or since its a fine dining establishment have the option of accommodating the guest's request if the guest has a very particular way they want their burger...A meal with one of their basic burger with fries ( tad overdone) and a soda ( we had a mint lemonade, quite average) sets you back by $45 all inclusive not bad for a fine dining place with pretty good if a little over-whelming service...
4
I loved this place! Especially as you can eat dinner from 5.30 which is great for families. My daughter had the kids steak, chips & vegetables - she devoured it! I had the pork belly salad and an entree crab pasta - delicious! Will definitely be back

For more pics and in depth review, please visit my blog at: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/db-bistro-moderneI had incredibly high hopes for db Bistro Moderne, especially after witnessing all the delectable photos online of their burgers exquisitely cut down the middle! It's too bad the restaurant didn't live up to the photos! For starters, we ordered the steak tartare. It was delicately plated with a perfectly poached egg on top and some greens and bread on the side. Disappointingly, the taste didn't match the presentation at all. It was in fact, quite tasteless. For mains we got the New England Casserole with seafood and fennel sausage. I feel like it's my duty to forewarn you all that the New England Casserole does not come with carbs. I clearly am not atas enough to know that casseroles come in different variations and was flabbergasted when we were presented with a huge bowl of seafood in only broth! Once I got over that surprise, I really started enjoying the dish and it ended up being my favourite of the night! The seafood was fresh whilst the soup was incredibly flavourful and light. To top it all off, we got the Frenchie Burger (beef patty with pork belly) but was wrongly given the Yankee burger which consisted of only a beef patty. It was pretty dull, but we were too ravenous to bother and ask them to change it. Sadly, the beef was undercooked and under seasoned and overall, the burger was a bit dry
3
Last night in Singapore thought we would have a treat - If you are looking for overpriced ordinary meals come here and waste your money like we did -definitely not fine dining - lamb was like a stew, pork loin was non existent - just a skinny price of pork covered in crumbs like a snitzel. Wines start22 glass for average wine. ( but the free breads were great) Go elsewhere but here
4
A nice setting for a not too expensive french dinner. Typical bistro dishes like foie gras and steak tartare are there and they taste wonderful.

Had my birthday celebration at this restaurant. Foods served was really superb from the salad to desserts. Services were good, the crew always really to help whenever we put our hands up. The atmosphere is good which you can really feel relax.
4
I walk into this restaurant for lunch with my mom, nephew and niece. The front hostess and the wait staff greet us and welcome us to the restaurant. The restaurant somewhat is modern and upscale enough for a bistro standard. I did order a seared salmon for myself which is great not over cooked fish which I will hate and my mom is not a good eater and I did order heirlooms tomato salad for her and surprisingly she loved it and my niece have a grilled jumbo prawn main course portion which is the prawn was cooked perfect and still can taste the freshness from the prawn head and my nephew had a tagliolini pasta with crab meat it was only ok for me but at least is a fresh pasta. Overall I'm very pleased with the service there was fast and all meal consider great

This is celebrity chef Daniel Boulud's take on a bistro. The decor was very good but looked more like an up-scale brasserie rather than a bistro.There were two of us and we ordered a pot of Spanish style mussels and Italian saltimbocca. The mussels were wonderfully tangy and savoury while the saltimbocca was decent although pork was used instead of veal. To wash it down, we had 3 Asahi beers.Both were nice however, it is what one could find on any corner café in Europe. What struck me was that there was nothing really French except for the name of the place.For the price (S$140), it was rather hefty and I bet they are just selling DB's name and status and therefore, I very much doubt I would step foot in that "bistro" again
4
Celebrated my bf's birthday. Food was great, I had the duck confit and it was the best I had in sg. Service was impeccable. Atmosphere was good. The only fault I had was that I had pre-ordered a small chocolate mousse for my bf's birthday and it wasn't up to expectations. At $38, it was too small and tasted ordinary. Will be back to try the rest of the desserts though

Been at Daniel in NYC and do NOT expect that coming here.We had the set menu which was very reasonably priced and really had a good selection.I had the snails which were just outstanding and I thought I could be in Paris.The braised short rib was as melt in your mouth as you would ever ask for. Very tasty.We did not have the burgers but the table beside us had them and we heard the raves from our table.My wife had the fish and it was extremely good as well. The service was very good but the server was so busy had no time for interaction. Something I really like.Good place

Made reservation in afternoon. Told them flying out that evening so the receptionist said we could come at 8.15 instead of 8.30. We arrived and then waited while they set up the whole section before we were seated while obviously VIPs were walked immediately to their table on other side. Then we waited and waited to be served. The staff were attentive and excellent when they finally got there. So we ordered the San Daniele prosciutto and as there was a small and large we asked if it was adequate entree for 3 the waiter assured me it was plenty. It did say 20 grams but was tired and not thinking. When it arrived I was so completely gobsmacked I forgot to take a photo. There was 4x 2 square inch pieces on a cutting board over half of it was fat, half a handful of rocket and 2 1 inch square pieces of shaved Parmesan on top of that at only a cost of S$35 ++, I have eaten at fine dining establishments all over the world but I truly thought this was a joke! I regularly buy this prosciutto at my local deli in Adelaide so I know it is not cheap but for that price they could have spared 3 whole shaved slices of the prosciutto not just the fat! Next I had Salmon, my daughter and friend had the chicken. My salmon was cooked medium and it was fine but no better than a good cafe in Adelaide, both my friend and daughter hated their chicken dish, it was bland and after tasting it I'm not sure what what would have made it French cuisine modern or otherwise. At over $200 I would have probably enjoyed a burger from McDonalds better and I normally wouldn't even eat them! We were then held up waiting for the bill and the cc processing as they did not seem happy that we skipped dessert by this time we were running late for airport, our luggage got delayed until the following evening and we nearly missed our flight and had to run down the travellators to catch it. Overall a bad experience to an otherwise good holiday. If you want French food in Asia go to Pearl in Seminyak. The chef is French, the maitre'd his equally gorgeous brother, the food superb, the service exceptional and the chef even came to each table to say hi and hoped we enjoyed his food. Sorry DB you do not have the right kitchen staff and they obviously don't like or nor do they taste the food they cook!!

Whilst the meal was ok I wold expect. A little more of the class touch you should expect of such an establishment. Food was pretty old but we only ate the burgers...still they were pretty good. The restaurant was not busy but the service could have been a little more intimate. I suspect people go their for the convenience close to the theatre, competing with Mozza.....
3
If your after something that's okay, than this will suit - service is what you would expect, ambience is very "chillaxed" without it being a local takeout joint and the food is ok, BUT in my view not memorable.We ordered the boubillanise and the frenchie burger. The soup was very good, broth intense, fish cooked very well, potatoes were a touch firm. The frenchie burger, for me, was a let down. The pulled pork was MiA, the rest was okay, but the pork was not making an impact for me as it appeared to be more of a tasteless fillet, than the expected stringy flavoursome pulled pork I was savouring when ordering
5
A conveniently located outlet just opposite the Marina Bay Sands theatre makes it an easy option for an evening out. Kitchen closes at 23:00 so we made our way in a hurry to ensure we were catered for.We had a usual Tarte Flambée (we are now ordering one each because they are so good I usually ended up frustrated having to share mine). This evening however so a little lapse in the quality of the Tarte, it was slightly soggy and not has crispy as it used to be. I guess it was taken out of the oven possibly a minute too early. This was the only fault in the entire meal. The duck confit was a new recipe and excellent as usual with a lovely crispy skin. Deserts, we opted for Durian Soufflé which was really excellent and a selection of ice-cream. The ice-cream were nothing remarkable but the Soufflé was fantastic (if you love Durian that is).Service was as usual very friendly and hospitable. A carafe of Priorat was a very nice addition to the meal. Certainly not the meal of the year but very enjoyable with excellent quality.Total bill was $200 SGD for 2

Great evening. Loved the crispy salmon dish and the special desserts we had: hot chocolate with ice cream and lemon squares. Awesome service, so hospitable servers! ;-)
4
We had dinner at Cut before Phantom of the Opera and desert at Db after the show. Amazing deserts and they have a special drink called "Phantom of the Orient". Quick and attentive service too.
5
This French and American fusion restaurant was everything that I thought it would be. The Manager Chris WIlliams right down to the waiter was polished in their presentation. The meal was reasonably priced and the atmosphere was very condusive. Would def recommend to others.
3
Impeccable service! My favorite - lemonade with lime & ginger, super refreshing!Quality and portion of food was solid, but seemed to be missing a kick to it, e.g. their steak was cooked the right way but you could tell the meat wasn't quite what you'd expect at a db restaurant... especially a db in Singapore. This was a slight disappointment after having been to their Maison Boulud in Beijing a few times and thinking Singapore's db would be equally amazing

Visit: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/07/db-bistro-moderne-back-for-desserts.html for full post and picAfter lunch at Pita Pan, I hopped over to DB Bistro, where I had visited three times previously, for their revamped menu. This place has always been one of my favourite dessert spots in Singapore and it still is :)If you are thinking that the desserts here are over-priced or belong to the atas petite sized kinds that are gone in less than 3 big mouthfuls, then you might be interested to pop by here to have a look.Out from the menu is the old Apricot Vanilla Souffle. The new angmoh pastry chef Benjamin Siwek has gone local to come up with this "Royale" Durian Soufflé ($15). This is by far, a soufflé with the most character. The fluffy mixture seems insubstantial as one digs a spoon in but the flavour fills up the mouth just like HD surround sound system echoing in every space. The queen fruit, mangosteen, was turned into a sorbet to accompany the durian but I was too busy with the soufflé.The peculiar thing is that the chocolate dessert here did not make a show. The Milk Chocolate Mousse with Peanut Brittle and Banana Ice Cream($15)did not have multiple textures even though it sounds crunchy. The base sat a rather dry brownie-like cake layer which did not help to score points.Another Southeast Asian inspired dessert was the Jackfruit Verrine ($15) which caused everyone's face to cringe with an extremely sour Lime Sherbet. But once you mixed it with the Coconut Tapioca and Palm Sugar, it all went down sweetly.This was another satisfying experience and I am looking forward to the new items for the next season! And last but not least, I am grateful for the complimentary treat of db's (or aka da Bomb!!) Madeleines, which are still as light as those on my previous visit. They might be rustic bakes but once you try these, it will be difficult to find a better one!Visit: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/07/db-bistro-moderne-back-for-desserts.html for full post and pi

So disappointed by the food that I don't even want to comment all the dishes we had but I have to say that it is far overpriced for that quality !How can you dare to serve what you consider as your signature burger with "Mc Cain"-type frozen french fries along with ketchup and mustard you can find in your home fridge ??? Although the meat patty was cooked as requested it was dry and you got to look twice to find the Foie Gras....We also ordered Chicken Tajine.... Well, throwing two slices of dried apricot in a dish has never made a Tajine. Veggies were insipid, so was the sauce and the entire dish. Chicken was dry and flavors were just not there...Desserts were acceptable although I'm still looking for the Chocolate Mousse as the name suggested it !Hopefully the wine we picked up was perfect but this is nothing to do with the Chef's skills !$220 for the wine that much worth it and $200 for the food is just a robbery !If you have $200 for two to spend on food find yourself another place at MBS 
3
We went there just before a show at MBS. We took set menus which were a good option as we were limited with time. A lot of tasty food with unusual flavors mixed together. Dishes however were "hit or miss" : while my starter tuna tartare was delightful, my main mussel dish was really not up to standard! Portions were a bit small as well. Convenient restaurant to go to a show but a bit disappointing considering it is a celebrity chef
5
With so many 'up market' restaurants that Singapore has to offer, I picked db as the venue for our 27th wedding anniversary dinner and a huge thanks to Chris Williams and his staff it was an amazing experience. Chris is a def asset to the restaurant as he looks after every single guest with a quick word and glance over to ensure the evening is run smoothly. I amaze at his attentiveness to every single aspect of the service delivery, there is nothing I can fault about the whole evening. Congratulations to Williams & Team.M AnthonyPert

This is one of those times when you hover between giving a restaurant an average or good score. Truth is, our Bistro Moderne experience in Singapore's "Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands" ranged from poor to excellent; four diners, four different experiences - well, for the food at least.The French onion soup was very good ... possibly a touch too much bread, but otherwise a great example of this French classic. There's not much you can do to make steak tartare look appetizing and you can'd do much to alter its flavor ... it is what it is. However, the member of our party who chose this as a main course enjoyed it. I chose the pork saltimbocca, which I would describe as great comfort food - crispy, hot, tender. My only criticism was that the ratio of "crispy potatoes" to pork was a little mean and the bitter greens were better as a splash of color on the plate rather than something you would actually enjoy eating.The main complaint from one of our party was the ribeye steak which, although ordered and delivered medium rare, still managed to be dry. Possibly just an unlucky cut of meat, but this diner also wasn't too enthusiastic about the flavor. Considering that the ribeye was our most expensive plate at S$80 (approx US$63) it was disappointing - although not bad enough to send it back.Considering we didn't order wine and only one of our party had any alcohol, we thought the price was very high for what we experienced. It was mostly good, but by no means exceptional.As for service: the welcome was warm, but the subsequent service was patchy; some of the staff knew how to smile, others were quite cold and robotic.Not a bad choice for pre and post theater dining, but not worthy heading out to Marina Bay Sands to experience DB if you are based elsewhere in the city
5
I have been coming back to DB Modern for as long as I have live din Singapore, 4 years and am always amazed by the quality and consistency of the service, good and wine.The front of his is led by the the amazing Chris who always look after guests whether they are here for the first time or a regular. he ensures that you are well taken care of.The food is fantastic, great ingredients and wines to match. I recommend the lobster salad, tuna nicoise, seafood platter and of course the best burgers in Singapore!Go with the house champagne and you will leave happy!Oh and don't forget the madeleines - just mouthwatering and you can always find room for them!A must to go to in Singapore!

Very impressed with DB. We dined on a Monday night and took advantage of the NYC Degustation. Great sized served and wonderful value for money. Staff were lovely also.
5
Lovely restaurant, great service, not pretentious and excellent food. The frenchie burger is a must.
4
Food was lovely. Service was unintrusive and attentive. Expensive burger but worth it. Order patty at least medium with a side of dirty dancing (musical post dinner!) fabulous.
4
The DB burger is amazing...you can taste all the flavor of all the meat, foie gras and ribs at the same time... The mushroom crepe was good and the blue cheese iceberg was very good. Thought it was overpriced for simple lunch but it was actually pretty good
4
June 2013: Looking for lunch at Marina Bay Sands but not wanting "takeaway", found this excellent restaurant. Had a terrific "Pate Grand-Mere" followed by grilled (large) prawns with "Singapore" spiced vegetables. Good wine list but I was thirsty, solved by 2 Tigers. Lovely staff, interesting menu, what more could you want. Steve V, Gold Coast, Australi
5
We only needed to overcome the rather unfriendly reception, after that it was a fantastic experience in every respect. We were hosted by Sitha, an incredibly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable lady which made this evening even more memorable. The food was fantastic - fresh ingredients, French-style food with Asian influence and a very comprehensive wine-list. The portions are - unlike sometimes in France - big and the service is very attentive. One of the best French restaurants here in Singapore with prices still in an acceptable range
5
Delicious french bistro food. Very attentive service. Prix-fixe menu is good value. The braised short-ribs were to-die-for, and the strawberry tart was a work-of-art. The DB Burger (with foie gras) is highly recommended too. Excellent wine list. Complementary amuse-bouche & freshly baked after-dinner madeleines were a surprising treat
4
I had high expectations going into Daniel Boulud's first restaurant in Singapore, and my expectations were met by friendly attentive staff as well as excellent food.Apparently I hear its difficult to get a booking, especially during weekends. I just walked in and immediately got a seat at the bar. It is easier to get a place without booking if you don't mind sitting at the bar.For the appetizer I ordered the Tarte FlambÃ©e, its was ok - rather pricey for a thin piece of pizza with cheese, bacon and onions. For main course I decided to have the Frenchie Burger, which I considered tiny for a burger. Despite the size the burger, it was grilled beautifully and the condiments which accompanied the burger really brought out the freshness of the beef.After I finished my meal I was serve a complimentary basket of french petite madelines, one of the best medelines I've ever had - so much so that I ate the entire basket.Would I go back again, yes definitely! Both the service and the food was excellent and I am curious to try other options in the menu
4
Advertised as one of the celebrity restaurants at Marina Bay Sands, the service lets it down a bit, especially after dining at one of the other ones. After arriving and debating with the reception about our booking, which they seem to suggest we didn't have one, we were seated and a heavy traffic area near the front door. So I went back to recheck our booking and they finally agreed we had one, and put us in a quieter spot at the rear. The service continued to be a bit hit and miss all night, constantly trying to get staff attention for ordering and drinks, and even the bill at the end. The restaurant itself was very nice with great decor and some really good features internally. The food is what makes it good and saves the night and forgives the service sins. Being genuine French cuisine the food was first rate and couldn't complain about a thing, opting for the duck as a main was a good choice and it was as good as you can get anywhere. All courses were delicious, and would go back for the food, sad to see wait staff let the chefs down by average service, especially compared to one of its nearby rival celebrity restaurants

We tried DB this week, while shopping.Good news was they had a walk-in table for us and immediately took us to the table, by the window.A good start.The waitress was with us immediately and we had a great welcome, drinking water and bread on our table within 3 minutes.A good follow-up.Then we waited for someone to take our order ... and waited. At one point, we had three staff serving a corner close to us and no-one with us. We felt lonely.Finally, the waitress returned to us and took our order.Things returned to great.We ordered our food and drinks and they were both served to us very fast indeed. I had the Frenchie burger and my wife had the casserole. Both dishes were fresh, well seasoned, delicious and very filling. The garlic sauce served with the burger was VERY garlicky. Be warned, if you plan on any kissing afterwards.Overall a pleasant experience and we will return
1
Very much a location based prices on the menu. So don't expect any thing that is avalue for money. I found it to be very overrated, with the food nothing to rave about. Quite a shame.
5
Love the food and the atmosphere. Made for a great memorable meal and birthday celebration. Also great for before or after theatre. Service was good too.
4
While attending a conference in the adjacent convention centre I visited db with some friends for an evening meal. Any time restaurant has good foie gras and a bottle of Muga they are likely to get my vote. As well as the foie gras I had a superb burger with a Lyonnaise style twist. The service was very good and the attention of the excellent assistant general manager, Cedric helped to ensure a very enjoyable evening
4
We popped into db restaurant yesterday after visiting the art and science museum. Figured it was Mother's Day, so might as well have something lovely to eat. The wait staff were wonderful and attentive. I enjoyed my mushroom and spinach crepe and my husbands burger looked lovely. My margarita was delicious. Thoroughly recommend a burger at this lovely restaurant. I still think it is odd to have these lovely restaurants in a mall, no views and people walking past with their shopping... But they seem to work
4
We have dined at db Bistro at Marina Bay more than ten times and every time has been a quality experience. We have had dinner and brunch on numerous occasions and have yet to be disappointed with a single starter, main or dessert. Service has been quite good overall - especially for those dining with children. Indeed, the management has gone out of its way to make us welcome. We have dined in Boulud's restaurants around the world and actually find this one to be amongst the best and most likely our favorite. Certainly compared to db Bistro in NYC the service and atmosphere here is superior. While by no means inexpensive, on each occasion the combination of setting, service and cuisine has certainly been well worth the price
3
Had a large group with a pre-ordered menu, two choices for entree and main course, which was fine and should have allowed the kitchen to get the meals out while they were still hot, but this was not the case. Had tuna steak, it was cold and tasteless and it seemed to have some other meat which I think was shredded chicken mixed in with it, couldnt quite work out what it was and there was no discernable taste but it looked like chicken. The service was generally slow. Didnt eat anything here that would encourage me to return
3
Last year my husband and I had a fantastic meal (fix price) and were happy to recommend the restaurant. We returned on our visit to Singapore prepared for another great dinner - we had just one night at the end of a 6 week trip and thought this would be the right ending. Sadly, we were mistaken. The French onion soup was superb however my husband's pork belly entrée was very meagre with mostly salad and no crackling. For main course I ordered Coq au Vin and my husband ordered pork saltimbocca which was fine but accompanied by very peppery greens. The Coq had a blackened exterior and little flavour plus some of the chicken was undercooked. When we mentioned our issues to the staff we had no real response. Neither an offer to replace or to check the meal met the standards. My disappointment was severe. Obviously the restaurant now divides tourists into the "don't really count" group for service or good food. And all this cost us S$160 for a very average to poor meal. We will not be returning on our next Singapore visit
4
Went thrice with friends and relatives, and all visits were equally good. What to expect: French cuisine (bistro) with a New York twistI skipped the Foie Gras burger to focus on classic dishes, such as 'steack frites' while Coq-au-vin and other flamenkuch were brought to the table. Nothing mind blowing, but rather very good bistro food.The service is excellent - which is a rare enough in Singapore to be highlighted; choice of wine interesting and the mini madeleines are to die for. What about the atmosphere:the crowd is a decent mix of tourists and locals (including expats), in a decor you could find in any other western big cities Is it cheap:I would say it's good value for money, considering the standards (food and service) and the location Would I go back:For sure, whenever I would be craving for good meat or just to enjoy a nice dinner without having to burn all my credit cards

The food overall was quite good for simple French bistro fare. BUT in all fairness, this is a celebrity chef restaurant where Daniel Boulud has a deservedly stellar reputation in NYC. So any restaurant that bears his name/associate relies on that reputation. The Singapore branch does not live up to Boulud's high reputation. I directly attribute this to the service. It is of an inconsistent standard. We were welcomed warmly at the front counter. Great. Our waiters was not overly warm however. Disappointing. No butter knives were provided. Strange. We used our table knives to butter our bread - ok no problem. Our waiter does not replace our knives when our food comes out until we asked...he then goes to the next vacant table and grabs a handful of knives. What the?!? There was a lack of attention to detail and discretion.The service was also quite intrusive where the wait staff leaned in to take plates away and also came in from both sides to do so (it should be food comes from one side and plates cleared from the other so it is seamless and easy for the diner). Mains came out and the another waiter said "enjoy your meal" when one of our party clearly still did not have their food. Her food did come out shortly. But this is just another example of a lack of attention to detail which I do not expect from a Boulud restaurant.Also one more thing...what was a 2002 Riesling doing on the wine menu??? Well past its used by date. Not good
4
A group of us from the office came to DB Bistro since most of the party are from NY, where Daniel Boulud has a number of restaurants and a stellare reputation. It was not hard to get in, and we had a reservation for that same evening.What caught my eye on the menu was the Boullabaise. First thing the waitress tells us is they are out of Boullabaise. At 7pm!Anyway....there are plenty of other things on the menu so I went for the Casserole, with fish and sausage meat. Whilst the food was good, I think the expectation when heading to a celebrity chef restaurant is so high that you are very likely going go be disappointed.It wasn't a bad meal, it wasn't even that pricey for such a chef, and even though we all ate well it lacked that extra oomph to make it spectacular
5
Very friendly staff, very knowledgeable, veal was amazing!!
They have a great selection of imported Italian house wine which the sommelier from Finland was very good with his recommendation. A little pricy but you are in Singapore, worth the stop!
4
Db burger is so nice. Price is not that cheap but i recommend you go and taste on it. Walk in is difficult to get the table always
4
Food is average + or even better but definitely not a WOW, but staff are very helpful and will give you a personal care. Menu is limited as well.
5
Had a great meal, great atmosphere, great drinks ( could,t finish it, would never of been able to concentrate on roulette) guess where I went after my cocktail. Food was great. Another great night on a great holiday.
4
Had a rib eye at this famous restaurant and was pleasantly impressed. I asked for a medium well done rib eye and felt it was over cooked but it was still tender and came with an excellent sauce.Service staff are excellent and a bonus to the franchise.Charges are, in all fairness, quite reasonable in my opinion given this restaurant belongs to one of the world's most renowned chef's and his team of well trained chefs.No complaints. Will be back again
3
The place is ok and reasonably respectful of mostly french cuisine, but I think the price is excessive. £125 (approx. $220 SGD) when we both had a couple of starters (no main) and a couple of glasses of wine is far too much. I know Singapore is expensive, but I really don't see how these prices can be justified in what I would call a fairly "normal" restaurant. We had a plate of cold meats, 6 escargots, a risotto and a steak tartare (both in appetizer portions). They were fine but not for that price. The place is typical of mall restaurants: impeccable but with little personality
5
We had a table of 12 so booking Easter brunch was a bit of a headache. Fortunately, DB had a table for us ... As usual, the food was wonderful and service friendly and prompt. We had oysters, the seafood platter and assorted pate and cold cuts to start, all very satisfying. Next main courses ... ordered almost everything on the menu - mushroom crepe, seafood bouillabaisse, DB burger, duck confit - all uniformly yummy! Of course, the DB burger stole the show for its taste and density, the guys were full after having one each. Which left the girls to polish off desserts! The durian soufflé and molten chocolate disappeared in no time, but the crowd favourite was still the madaleines which came complimentary
4
We had just braved huge winds and rain to see the view from the top of Marina Bay Sands and couldn't wait to have a warm hearty dinner. DBs was perfect. I had the mushroom soup as the entree and the duck confit for the main. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. My partner had the French onion soup, which was also very tasty. The service was great and the ambience of the venue was also good. We will definitely come back to DBs to try other food on the menu when we next visit Singapore
4
Dont get us wrong, the service was excellent. The food was very good but in an ultra competitive market is was just that, very good not great. I guess that is what bistro food is all about though.The setting located within the shopping complex dulls the overall experience considerably and possibly contributes to a feeling that this is more expensive than it should be.
3
Ever since it opened in the 'celebrity chef' promenade at Marina Bay Sands, I was keen to try the burger with foie gras - fast food meets decadence. It was a very disappointing experience. You'd think a slice of foie gras inside a beautiful hot meat patty would be nice and oozy and soft - it wasn't. Rather, it was like biting into a slab of cold butter. The staff were, in typical Singaporean fashion, very efficient but we felt we were squatters in a valuable piece of real estate, to be moved on as quickly as possible with a minimum of fuss. The restaurant had a weird vibe - more cafeteria than what befits the New York City HQ where we've dined and enjoyed a wonderful experience. Our other food was OK but not a wonderful experience
5
Whilst this is in a shopping mall it is most definitely not your average shopping mall eatery. The food was beautiful, service slick and efficient. Would definitely eat here again if back in Singapore.
5
Just had to eat here. Been meaning to for awhile now. So on my 4th stay at Marina Bay Sands I finally buckled under and went for the signature burger.Now I wasn't expecting too much from the meal. I mean, how much better can a burger be? But I took the cue from the fries. The second my meal arrived -- which was rather fast -- i made for the fries, served in a paper cone. I'm not big on fries. (I don't even bother to order them at McD's.) but the first bite just melted in my mouth! Yes, best fries ever! Needless to say, I ate every strip! Back to the burger. Whoa, sink your teeth in it and your feel the tender ribs just rolling on your tongue chased by the muddy flavor of the foie gras -- beef patty stuffed with tender, tender ribs and fine foie gras. Nice! And it wasn't a massive sandwich either. Just nice.Was told the madeleines were to-die-for. But before I could order it, the staff placed a whole basket of the delights in front of us -- compliments of the outlet. (It helps when you're dining with Marina Bay Sands's finest managers.) Yes, this is their piece de resistance. They just melt, melt in your mouth. Needless to say, they were so yummy, I began eating them like peanuts. Once piece after another. Don't just take my word for it. While you be the judge, I'll definitely be back!
5
If you need quality creative food go there. Fine restaurant with exellent service located in the big shopping mall. Designed as a typical parigian bistrot they serve some typical french dishes made in modern style. They have good wine list and incredible deserts. Here I feel very comfortable. Next visit in Singapore I will come back there 2 or 3 times
3
The best thing the DB Bistro Moderne has going for it is it's location -- directly across from the MBS Theatre. I ordered one of their specialty New York burgers. It was good, but not great. The service is friendly and attentive. I especially liked how our server kept an eye on the time so we wouldn't be late for our show. In short, it's a very reliable and convenient place to have a nice dinner before a show, but don't expect to be wow'ed
4
Went there with 2 ladies. For starters, we ordered the Seafood platter, which is quite expensive at S$145, and a seared foie gras. Platter supposed to be for 2, but managed to squeeze out for 3 since I was the only guy. Service staff was good in that they told us it was a cold platter. Had 6 tiny oysters and 4 very tiny mussels, a small lobster which was quite nice, a few very fresh prawns, and a yabbi-like thingy. Foie gras was excellent, one of the best I've had. For mains we shared the ribeye medium, the asparagus risotto with fried egg, and bouillabaisse.. The ribeye was good, even medium was tender and juicy (but La Barca's is nicer). The fried egg sounded strange for the risotto but since I like eggs, I tried that and it turned out quite well (but those who don't like cheese, this might be a bit strong). And the bouillabaisse had a bit of everything (ie not a large portion) but it was done well. We finished off with the mille-feuille and a selection of 3 cheeses. Mille-feuille portion was again not big and had a cinnamonny taste (i'm not a big fan of cinnamon) but the cheeses were nice (I love cheese). One of the ladies doesn't really like cheeses, so I asked for the milder ones, and they were still quite strong (and I loved them).Overall, food was good but portions were a bit small. Service was attentive but at times a bit distracted. Water was not filled up constantly (which I expect in a fine dining restaurant)
4
I had the gourmet burger that they are famous for and paid $47 dollars for a burger, but is was delicious and probably one of the best I have ever eaten, so I would say it was worth it, but the prices are above average. Service and food was very good
4
Most people would head here for the signature burgers but I would recommend the ribeye steak instead. At $80, not cheap but it comes with fries and some lettuce so you don't need to order sides. Beautifully seasoned, the sauces are to really necessary but the peppercorn sauce (the other option is bearnaise) went well with the meat. The best steak I have had in a long time. For appetizers, my party had the mushroom soup and the pan-seared foie gras. The FG is not cheap at $39 but you get a size able piece. However, the mushroom soup was the standout, amazing flavours and textures, do be warned the bowl is quite large so come hungry! For dessert we were so stuffed so we just had sorbets, the mangosteen was nice, the rhubarb less so. Also, be sure to order one of the interesting cocktails!
4
I was taken here by a business partner. The ambience of the place is very pleasant and the food was pretty good too. I know it was expensive. The overall experience was just a little overpriced for my liking. I am guessing its Marina Bay Sands syndrome !The pre-starter was the Assiette Lyonnaise, some interesting items on there like the duck prosciutto but the portions were truly miniscule. I know it’s not supposed to be overwhelming but we are talking minute here.The soups were very good and the staff were quite happy to split one portion between two persons.The Mushroom soup was excellent although the French Onion was a little on the rich side.For the main course two of us shared a Beef Wellington, this was spoiled a little bit as the waiting staff neglected to tell us it would take 40 minutes plus the get out to us. The waiter did eventually bring a cheese flat bread to “tide us over”. In fairness the chef came out and apologised and insisted that the waiting staff were under instructions to inform diners ordering this dish. The other two diners had the Australian Dorper Lamb Duo, they said it was good and it certainly appeared to be so.I passed on dessert but the profiteroles eaten by a colleague seemed to be lovely. The Opera Moderne looked to be a little on the dry side.Overall good service apart from the information lapse on the main course and it was unusual to have a sommelier on hand. The food was good, not outstanding but those prices

Really good food with affordable price. I really like the food, doneness of the fish (parner) and the meat (me) was excellent. The only thing I will not order the next time is the desserts, wasn't so good as I expect after the good dinner I had. For the rest, five stars. I will back for sure

I had dinner in the NY midtown version of this Daniel Boulud institution back in November and that was a similar experience. Competent dishes, competent service and high prices. Yesterday (Sunday) me and my companion were early enough to choose the menu option (2 course $58, 3 courses $68) and opted for the first one. That includes a glass of wine which makes DB good/better value. The starter we both chose, Seared Tuna Nicoise ($26 as a standalone dish) was great, actually better then our mains. Good portion, yummy tuna and with the requisite potato that a lot of times chefs leave out of this classic. Mains were Salmon (not a fan) and a daily special chicken (good but not exciting). We didn't try desert, it didn't look good enough on paper to justify the calories. Service is professional but a bit sterile. Better than next door Mozza in my opinio

The manu are well define and the waiters/waitresses are always on your side to explain and recommend...
3
Had dinner.
Difficult to get a table. A reservation is needed.
The DB burger was average. I do not see the hype.
The other dishes were competent. Nothing fantastic.
Service was good.
Prices were high.

Having a meal here supports the difference between dining and eating. Took advantage of the Mondays special of Bourgogne set menu with the wine tasting option. You get to choose one of 3 options for entree and manic and one ofmtwomfro dessert. Chose the snails, sea bass and the gingerbread with chocolate. Simply delightful. Well presented and very well cooked. The wines served was a white for entree and a Pinot noir for main which were both very drinkable.All in all a great experience and well worth it
4
Sure you are in a large Singapore mega-complex (so don't expect the traditional 'soul' you will find in a regular French bistrot) but it does say 'moderne' on the door.The ambiance is casual and bustling. The menu is full of tasty starters and mains. The staff is also willing to help advise you should you want to discover something new.A nice balance between the more classic French fare with a modern twist (not too heavy) ;-)Warmly recommended and look forward to returning on my next visit

DB Bistro was the perfect choice for dinner for the last night of our holiday. The menu was full of great options and the food was exceptional! I had the duck and the meat was cooked beautifully and it's side of cabbage complimented it perfectly! I would highly recommend it although my partners green casserole seafood curry was equally as great! The atmosphere was lovely and it was quite reasonably priced. The only negative I can say is that I wasn't thrilled with the $170 bottle of wine the waiter recommended, it really wasn't that great. Definitely come here for a great night out
4
We've been there for twice. For both times, I really love the bread basket. On our first visit, we ordered what we felt like eating. I had the DB burger, which was really good. There was foie gras stuffed in the beef pate. While my husband ordered some stew seafood, which he's totally in love with.On our second visit, we let the waiter recommended to us. It was Christmas eve, so there are some special dishes on the menu. We had escargot, scallop black tie (scallop with black truffles), new orleans casserole and chocolate fondant. I liked them all, except the chocolate fondant wasn't as nice as the one I have had in Gedre
3
I went there for an afternoon snack after shopping with mum, and we shared the signature db burger with a side of sauteed vegetables. The burger deserves every adjective associated with excess, it's rich, decadent, and utterly scrumptious. The cooked-as-ordered medium rare beef patty is studded with braised, pulled short rib, and further stuffed with a large piece of foie gras. Talk about overindulgence! The bun was nice and chewy, almost brioche-like, and stood up well when bit into. The burger is also big enough to share with mum, as small meal. The fries that came with the burger was probably the best fries I've had in Singapore. Perfectly seasoned and fried, crisp on the outside but fluffy on the inside.The sauteed vegetable we ordered on the side was a huge letdown, I'm sad to say. The baby French beans and brussels sprouts were soft and mushy, the baby carrots limp and sad, and the mushrooms cooked to death. I suspected the veggies were frozen before cooking (sure tasted like it was), but our server told us they were fresh. Maybe they sauteed the veggies earlier in the week and kept it refrigerated? Anyway, I wouldn't recommend it. This is the reason I'm rating this place "average".The jug of Endless Summer punch we ordered was delicious, and just the right size for sharing.Service was faultless, and gracious. More restaurants should be like this.The place is also very cozy, and I loved that they had their own restrooms. I would have been peeved to pay those prices if I had to queue in the mall's public bathrooms
5
Wandered in for lunch on a Monday and the place wasn't busy. Got a table without reservation. Service was attentive. We had shared a side salad. I had a homemade lemonade which was delicious my husband had a beer. I tried the DB burger which was just the best burger I have ever eaten, perfectly cooked, didn't fall apart, extremely tasty. My husband had a different burger (can't remember the name) but he said it was excellent.I wish we found this place earlier on during our stay in Singapore. We must of walked past it a few times too. Decor is nice, the toilets are very clean
5
Having eaten there, several times, for a variety of reasons, it has always been a great experience. Though may be on the high side, not necessarily overpriced.Service staff has always been efficient, courteous and attentive. (Have read that some diners had different experience when it comes to service).They will accommodate to requests

It is very unusual for us to eat French food in Asia but this time we decide to indulge ourselves in this Bistro and went for the Frenchie and the DB burger. Being in the Marina Bay Sands means that prices are higher than expected but the place is well run thanks to Romain who knows his wine and is very happy to assist. Service is impeccable. Food is good. The wine list is very impressive especially in a shopping centre. We went for 1 dessert for 2 and with a bottle of sparkling water, 1 espresso coffee and wine (half a bottle) the total bill was SGD 225.95. It is indeed very expensive for 2 burgers and a half bottle of vin du pays d'oc by all standards but it is a bit of luxury. PS: My espresso was not good (SGD 7). Not creamy, it looked like a tasteless soup. An effort needs to be done on this
3
Away for Christmas and this up-market restaurant looked OK. Very limited menu and nothing special about the food - being French we expected a certain flare. The Gnocci was indeed very good but the rest was only average.
3
Had the set lunch which was excellent value for money and the mussels were delicious.
But why is it that staff in a restaurant cannot remember who ordered which dish, there were only 4 of us, a simple sketch on their notepad would work.
4
True to Chef Daniel's standards, the place has a nice menu spread not too extensive. We ordered the house favorite db burger which was heavenly... sirlion meat filled with braised short ribs and foie gras between a parmesan bun... Grilled foie gras with poached pear resting on a ginger bread was a great starter. The braised pork belly was so-so for us being it was a very Asian dish. Table service was great. Nice to have knowledgeable staffs recommending what food to try, which wine to go with what, etc... Didn't have room for desert. Will definitely go back again

DB Bistro Moderne is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. We have been there several times and left always with bright smiles on our face. The quality of the food is great, the service is consistently very good, the chef and restaurant manager are always present and ensure highest standards. Granted, it's not the cheapest place to eat put you get what you pay for.What to recommend? Everything. The menu changes regularly. You should try the tarte flambee. Also the deserts are always amazing.We have not been disappointed by a single dish, although I am personally not a big fan of the burgers. I just feel I want to eat something more elaborated when I am at DBB. But they are good, just a bit raw for my taste
3
We went here for NYE and were expecting great things. The menu is classic French bistro and there are really not too many surprises. (They put a $198 set menu in front of us but luckily I had checked beforehand and we asked for the usual menu to order a la carte and this has much more reasonable prices!) We had the cheaper steak - it was tasty but chewy. Fries were fantastic. We had the chocolate fondant for dessert and can't fault it. Service was interesting. We deliberately asked for plenty of space between courses and reiterated it after our entree was cleared....only to have mains delivered within about one minute. Our desserts were at our table in record time too! Not quite sure why as they were not doing sittings as everyone started clearing out for fireworks after 11.30pm. They gave us masks and whistles for NYE - nice touch. All in all a nice night but the service just doesn't hit the mark. It wouldn't take much to improve...some mystery diners giving management some feedback which they then act on

This is a Daniel Boulud restaurant - hence DB Bistro Moderne Singapore. Expectations were high for a super dinner experience esp we had to book by email and had 2 reconfirmation call and email.I can say the food is fairly average for the price range. Dessert was nice, a saving grace. Apart from that, the ambiance was nice and pleasant for dinner.Another visit? Maybe not.It was a bad dining experience which earned me no points with my clients for my restaurant choice.db bistro Singapore - go if you wish to spend a considerable amount of money on average food, experience below par service, be given baseless wine recommendations and be not wished anything on your way out.Otherwise stay away. Try CUT, Catalunya - similar (not the same) price point - much better experience
3
DB certainly fell below my expectations, but still provided a great meal.Our waitstaff was not nearly as personable or helpful as the table across from us with no children. Although the larger gentleman with the booming voice was a ray of sunlight.The food:The $42 burger was interesting to say the least, whilst I appreciated the complexity of flavours, it didnt scream the best damn burger you have ever tasted, which it should at that price point. Merry well and rockpool offer equally as good options for less dollars on Perth. The pomme frittes were cooked very well and went down a treat, the recommended Californian red was matched very well and guzzled appropriately. My wife chose mushroom soup and chilled crayfish, which both were seasoned well, cooked well and ticked all the right boxes.All in all a decent experience but probably would not pull me back inFood 6.5/10 service 7/10 decor 7.5/1
3
visiting this restaraunt had high expectations, did not live up to them. the soup was lovely... but $42 for a burger that was basic. i genuinely would pick a big mac, found the burger bland and held no value.. service good, atmosphere strange being in mall

I don't really know where to start.I came back to this place with clients expecting to have a great experience as always.I was to a certain extent expecting to be recognised given that was the case for the last two times. But to my sheer disappointment not only were they not able to recognise that I was a repeat guest but the experience in general was not good.The familiar faces are gone. The ones who have replaced them don't unfortunately have the flair or flamboyance to fill the void.Let me say that there was nothing wrong with the service - it has just lost the "Daniel Boulud" element. Pity. A great restaurant has lost its spark.Food was average at best this time around. Salmon for me was very overcooked .The mains for the rest also didn't have a wow factor. This was my guest's first time at db in Singapore, having been to the one in NY a considerable number of times - this experience was disappointing.The nail in coffin for me was when the gentleman I ordered wine with tried to explain to me how the wine I had ordered would benefit from decanting. Being no expert in the field I reluctantly agreed. It was a mistake. The wine lost its structure. That was an expensive mistake.It was a bad dining experience which earned me no points with my clients for my restaurant choice.db bistro Singapore - go if you wish to spend a considerable amount of money on average food, experience below par service, be given baseless wine recommendations and be not wished anything on your way out.Otherwise stay away. Try CUT, Catalunya - similar (not the same) price point - much better experience

As in other Singaporean newly opened restaurants the service has room for improvement. DB Bistro has very nice food, I think the service needs improvement. It is not that people are not nice or friendly, it is the lack of service knowledge and how to deal with customers.Nevertheless I can recommend the restaurant - specially the steaks
1
Awful food, over $200 for what was a fancy toasted cheese sandwich, a dry salmon fillet and a pasta. 4 Soft drinks.
Most god awful place. I won't cry if it closes.
5
I came here last time I holidayed in singapore and didn't hesitate to come back this time around. The service was great as was the food. We ordered the duck terrine, pork rillette (amazing) for entre and had confit duck and the original db burger for mains. If you go to DB you must go the DB burger, it was succulent and flavorsome and worth going back for on its own. Our waiter was also very helpful and informative when we were choosing our cocktails. Looking forward to another great meal here next time I holiday in singapore

I decided to dine in DB Bistro Moderne over its neighbour osteria mozza given that the reviews were pretty good but I was slightly dissapointed that it did not quite match up to my expectations.Reservation was efficient. In fact special mention to Jessica of the Hostess team that replied me in 5 minutes. Also because I was celebrating a birthday with my dining companion, she was able to arrange a surprise dessert with the birthday wishes written on the plate to my dining companion.All the arrangement done via e mail correspondence. This was great as I flew in to SG the day before and did not have any time to make any arrangement any earlier.However the slight dissapointment was the bread that was provided to us. It was a tad bit salty. I had the duck confit where it was cook to almost perfection, crispy duck skin but it was a tad bit salty as well. Crying shame as I thought the saltiness ruin the dish. My dining companion's pork belly was average as well.Chocolate Fondant was lovely though. I think that was the best dish for the night which probably salvage the night.Service was good but I doubt there will be a return visit and may give Osteria Mozza a go instead

With the arrival of Marina Bay Sands and RWS Sentosa, it's great to see so many celebrity chefs opening outposts a little closer to the southern hemisphere. DB Bistro Moderne is one example, and a recent visit confirmed why celebrity chefs get such a title. The food - I had a steak bernaise, with pomme frites - was excellent, the staff accommodating, and a pleasant, professional atmosphere where everyone from mothers and (well-behaved) children and business people were dining. It is great to be able to do some luxury shopping at MBS then come down to the restaurants for an equally luxurious lunch. This does, however, come at a cost - lunch for one, including a glass of wine, came out at over S$100.A nice touch illustrating that the staff are willing to go the extra mile - after I pointed out one item had been left off the bill, I was provided with a complimentary basket of Madeleines - I was too full to eat them all but it was a very kind touch
5
For appetizers, try any of the fresh oysters and the foie gras terrine. For the main courses, of course you should try the signature burger with foie gras and pork. The New Orleans Casserole with mussels and sausages is also a treat. The duck dish prepared in three different ways is a pleasant surprise. Both the mussels and the duck are dishes good for two. And for the dessert, my favorite is the profiteroles with a chocolate disk that melts when they pour the extra chocolate sauce. Oh and before I forget, have a dirty vodka martini before you begin your dining experience -- the best way to relax to enjoy your dinner
5
We feel slightly bad about the fact we had burgers in Singapore where there are so many great things to eat but it has to be said that these were superior burgers washed down by some very good champagne. Highly recommended if you feel like french bistro food.

I patronized this restaurant for lunch on a weekday. The ambiance was actually very pleasant and the staff were really friendly. I ordered the pan-seared foie gras, a seafood platter as well as their signature DB burger. The foie gras was excellent. For the price I paid for this dish, the portion was substantial (compared to other places) and it was cooked to perfection. The seafood platter was very well presented and it included a maine lobster (small), scampi, prawns, oysters, sea snails and small bamboo clams (if I'm not wrong). It was served with 4 different sauces which they were pretty generous with (depending on what you define as "generous"), so overall it was pretty good. However, the DB burger was not up to my expectations. It was not as big as I imagined it to be, and no doubt it was delicious, but a little bit on the tough side. The fries that came with it were excellent though. Overall, I would say it was a satisfying lunch, not great though because I've eaten better seafood platters and also, this was the first time I ate a burger of that type (a combination of not just beef) which turned out not so much to my liking. Still I would recommend this place for dates or client lunches but not for family occasions unless you're willing to "pay a little bit more"
5
We were very impressed by the food quality. Although extremely crowded the staff were very attentive, friendly and couldn't do more for us to enjoy our dinner. A great option for dinner in Singapore with a convenient location after a long day of shopping in MBS
5
I had the New Orleans Casserole. It was surprisingly. The broth at the bottom of the dish was so good that I made sure I had all of it. Even the fries that were served with it were crisp and delicious. One friend was happy with her beef carpaccio. The oysters were also fresh.It was a lovely dinner and not really expensive. I spent 50 Singapore Dollars for my casserole, including the tip. The food servers were very nice about splitting the bill and gave each one of us our own so that we could pay separately
5
We picked this restaurant while transiting in Singapore for a few hours. It did not dissappoint us. The restaurant receptionists were courteous; we made a reservation and when I mentioned our name, they acknowledged the reservation (by heart) and right away escorted us to our table. The waitress attended our table was courteous, friendly and professional, too. She eagerly explained the menu and answered our questions. She paid a very good attention to our table.The food was simply great. The soups, Tomato Soup and French Onion Soup were amazingly delicious! The aromas were wonderful, too; so when they reached our table, we were so excited and couldn't wait to taste them. The soups really tasted as good as the aromas.The Grilled Chicken Breast was delicious. It was juicy and also tender. The French Tart was greay, too. It was crispy enough but not too dry. The fromage blanc was tasty and blended well with the mushrooms.The dessert, pannacotta with tropical fruits was just ok, overall. The pannacotta pudding itself was good; but I personally prefer it with berries. The cookie was a terrific complement to the pudding; it was crispy, crunchy and the flavour balanced with the milky pannacota.It was a great lunch. We will definitely come back there again when we are back in Singapore
5
Foie gra burger was great, not as packed as the other celebrity chef restaurants, service was always good.
3
Hard to live up to the hype of all these celebrity restaurants. I had dinner and it was fine but nothing great. A bit on the salty side which is unfortunate as that's the one thing I remember about the dish.
3
Good lunch and very crowded during lunch time. Average quality and a bit tastless. Food Ok. Service very mediocre. The staff was not up to the task.
4
Service was very good. Very attentive and pro-active staffs who are constantly on the lookout for patrons seeking their attention.
Though food was a little on the pricey side but the selection was extensive and tasted good.
Will return for more.
5
We are usual customers to this restaurant and the food is always fantastic. Their service and care exceeds our expectations every time
3
Had lunch at DB Bistro and ordered the 'famous' DB Burger for an amazing $40+. I, unfortunately, have had MUCH better burgers for MUCH less. The foie gras was not really that noticeable and the burger had very little flavor. Save your money and choose another dish. The onion soup was good though.
5
Must have - DB Burger. Best burger I've eaten. Juicy! The accompanying fries are to die for! Casual dining, friendly service. As it is located opposite the Marina Bay Sands theatre, many will crowded the restaurant for a quick dinner before the performance starts at around 8pm
4
Sometimes i wish tripadvisor has a rating between average and very good, as DB falls into such a category. We decided to try their famous DB burger during lunch, and ordered their lunch set. The regular set if you order all other stuff is $40 but add $15 if you want the burger, so that just increases my expectations if you want to charge more. Some of us had the frisee salad, others had the duck terrine. The salad was ok/average same old same old, my friends liked the duck terrine. We all had the DB burger, and the patty was more like a ball rather than a flattish patty. The beef ball had to accommodate some bacon bits and foie gras. Because of the super tall/odd/round shape of the burger, one probably has to deconstruct it and eat it in portions rather than like a normal burger. The taste was ok, not as juicy as i would like it, and am unsure it's worth the price. Dessert was either a chocolate mousse or apple crumble, the latter looking more delicious than my average mousse. Service was average, they certainly weren't keen to engage you or exceed your expectations at this celebrity restaurant, though they did fill our glasses regularl
5
i had dinner in this bistro during the f1 weekend and i am happy to say that my dinner here made the weekend even more delightful! we had the pre-dinner cocktails --- so good! definitely set the expectation of a modern gastronomic must-do. do not fail to order the special burger with foie gras. i am so happy with the service, truly world-class. very attentive staff and helpful with the menu selection. i can honestly say, it's made my visit to the marina bay sands more memorable. will visit again next year
3
not worth the high dollars. The chicken potpie contained chicken bone! Average food for a lot of money
5
We were finished with work and had some time on our hands so we walked over to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to look at the shops and the casino. As one would have it, we started to get a little peckish and decided to stop in at the DB Bistro Moderne to see if there was something we could nibble on. When we sat down, little did we know we were in for a culinary delight. We were only looking for a light snack and started with the Heirloom Tomato Salad and some nice wine. The salad was exceptional and was served with some excellent homemade backed bread that was just absolutely wonderful. We could not stop there, so we went on to order one Tart Flambée & one Tart Grantinée. They both were fantastic and the wine choice was superb. To end it all off, we order the Chocolat Fondant with ice cream, which as was expected exceptional. When we were asked about our experience by our waiter, we could not say enough about the meal and made a specific comment about the bread. To our delight, we were given an extra added treat and were able to try the freshly backed baguette. As you probably can imagine by now, it was out of this world. The excellent food was only topped but the extremely tentative service. The prices were a value based on the quality of the food. If and when we are in Singapore again, we will make this one of our stops

I have eaten many burgers in my life, I grew up in the US Midwest and went to college in Texas. But the db original burger was by far the best burger I have ever eaten. My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Hotel and decided to go to db Bistro Moderne for lunch. I had read bad reviews about the size of burger, but I ordered the 3-course lunch and walked away stuffed. My wife ordered the Frenchie burger that came with french fries and it was very good as well.We did not have reservations, but were able to get a table for lunch. We went around noon and not many people, but it filled up and was nearly full by the time we left.The staff was excellent, with the right balance of being attentive and also giving space. My only complaint is that we were offered two types of water, sparkling or still, when we sat down and didn't realize until they brought the Fiji bottle out that we'd be charged an extra $11. But that wasn't enough to ruin our experience.I was looking on the menu and I wanted to get the original burger, so the best value was to order the 3-course meal and get an appetizer and dessert as well. For the appetizer, I choose the country duck terrine and it was very, very good. Right balance of ingredients and it was a good choice. The burger came exactly as ordered. The combination of the braised short rib meat inside the sirloin burger was the perfect combination. The foie gras was just that extra that made the burger a top dining experience. The fries were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the three sauces that came for dipping. My dessert was the apple crumble (can't remember the name) and it was great with the side of vanilla bean ice cream. Our server mentioned it was new and asked for feedback. No complaints from me! And in casual conversation, we were talking with our server about how my wife and I had just gotten married six weeks ago, and during my dinner course, she brought out a batch of mini-muffins that were so good. My wife didn't order any dessert, so she appreciated them.Our experience at db Bistro Moderne was extremely positive. It is on the expensive side, but worth the splurge
5
This is an awesome restaurant serving up Lyonnaise fair with a New-York feel to the ambiance. Had lunch here yesterday with my girlfriend. It's definitely a place to impress a date. We sat by the bar so we could be closer to eachother. She had a perfectly crafted Bloody Mary and I had crisp & clean Swiss mountain ale. We both had the lobster salad to start and the DB burger for the main. We paired the food with a carafe of the house white & red respectively. The DB burger is one of the best burgers in S'pore and stuffed with foie-gras. The staff (particularly the bar-tenders) are some of the friendliest I have come across. Nu-jazz / Bossa Nova playing in the background. Very cool. Very chic. We'll be back
3
I visited this restaurant with a group of 10 business colleagues. I know restaurants struggle with large groups like ours.We had a set menu and I enjoyed the tomato soup and the mushroom pasta.I have to admit I was disappointed and many of my colleagues felt similar.The soup was ok and it was nice and thick. It seemed to be fresh. However, the taste was nothing special, not especially 'tomatoey' or spicy or anything, just ... tomato soup.The pasta was also ... ok but nothing special. No explosions of flavours and I found the pasta itself a little heavy and unsubtle. Don't get me wrong, perfectly cooked, just nothing special in the flavour department.Some of my colleagues had beef and they seemed to enjoy that a lot.The wine was great!I also found the service a little intrusive. Admittedly we had pushed 5 tables together, so they probably did not have the space they are used to. However, for a celebrity chef restaurant, I expect attentive and unobtrusive, almost invisible service. That did not happen and conversations were regularly interrupted and I frequently had to lean one way or the other to help the staff serve, move cutlery, replenish drinks etc.I'll go back and try it out with my wife and see how A La Carte goes
5
Even in spotless Singapore, this restaurant was spectacularly clean and thoroughly slick in every regard. From the flawless waiting staff (Raynaldo was memorably impressive) who were ever attentive, friendly and clearly committed to creating a great dining experience; to the superb parisienne style breads with unsalted butter when you arrive; to the Fiji drinking water that the celebrities seem to favour (this week), to the main game - the burgers, it was all a first-class dining experience. The desserts were fantastic too - two of us tried them as the rest of the group were already bursting - see photos. They even provided freshly baked complimentary madeleine cakes which are one of their signature dishes to go with our coffee. The fit-out too was made to last and won't date as they've used expensive, timeless materials in creative ways. The dining chairs would weigh 15+ kg each so won't be falling apart quickly, marble topped tables for even groups of 8-10 like our group, to glimmering glass and tiles which respect the Parisian heritage of the founder but interpreted for an international restaurant that could happily be plonked anywhere around the globe. One of the hallmarks of better restaurants is the standard of their bathrooms and here, DB bistro doesn't disappoint from wall hung toilets to stunning and subtle lighting to the towels you use to dry your hands, it is a welcome respite after travelling around Asia where toilets are not always memorable for the right reasons. So, yeah, we were impressed mightily with our unplanned visit to DB bistro which only added to our exceptional but all too short time at Marina Bay Sands with all that it has to offer
5
They change their menu often so you may not see the same dishes twice. I went back for the pulled pork burger this trip, but it wasn't available. We had an avocado and lobster salad and some duck...both were excellent. You can't go wrong with this place.
5
I just went to db Bistro and got a Original db Burguer. It was amazing! Very good the mixture of beef, ribs and foie gras. I was thinking that it would very expensive, but the price was ok if you consider where you are. It was a good experience
4
Basically, DB's concept seems to be to offer customers traditional French brasserie fare with top-quality ingredients and it works. The food is consistently good and the service and attention to detail beyond reproach. There is a good and varied wine list and the sommelier is both knowledgeable and willing to allow one to sample different wines before one has to make a choice. This led to the discovery of a surprisingly delicious shiraz wine from Morocco. Prices are high as always in the MBS complex, but compared to Cut opposite, one does not feel fleeced. The overall ambiance is bright and friendly; as the French would say, it is "sympa"
5
My husband and I had not made any reservations for dinner and dropped into db late one evening in case they were still serving. Best move! The food was outstanding, the choice of starters was excellent, the burgers, although there were only a few to choose from, were so delicious and the choices were superb!The service was also brilliant, everyone was so friendly they made the whole meal a pleasure. Definitely recommend it
5
Drop in after check in to MBS without booking for dinner- managed to get a table for 2 of us.The food were good especially the duck confit - good house wine to pair - and the price was reasonable tooWill definitely dine again if in Singapor
5
Would definitely come back to this impeccable restaurant. The food and atmosphere are excellent but most impressive was the service! The attentive waiters did not miss a thing and the food was delivered promptly. A special request for strawberries and icecrem was gladly catered to.
4
Food was great. Service superb. Not the cheapest but one of the more casual yum y places in MB sands!
5
Chose this place randomly and was pleasantly surprised by the exquisite taste of the food. The foie gras and duck confit were heavenly. Best french cuisine i have ever tasted in pr out of France.
4
Located inside the Marina Sands mall but the food is certainly superior than that of HY California which has a fantastic Bay view. We had oysters and they are fresh and tasty. Scampi has a natural sweet taste of seafood and goes well with the avocado dressing. I enjoyed the New Orleans casserole with abundance of mussels and clams. Duck duo was a bit bland though
4
Firstly, you need to be aware that this is a Celebrity Chef restaurant so do not expect the food to be cheap. We have been to this place twice and on both occasions we have had a great experience. The burgers and chips are excellent. You can see the quality of the meat when you bite into the burger. The chips are crisp, leaving you wanting more. They have a kids selection menu (you need to request for it) which has a good range of items. The atmosphere is very relaxed and you don't get a sense of rushing to finish your food so the next round of tables can start. The service at this place is great too, the staff are very attentive

Have been a few times now and invariably enjoy a burger at the bar for lunch. I'm still grappling with the concept of eating whilst staring out at a shopping mall but there you go. The food is invariably good and the burgers are excellent but the restaurant lacks a little atmosphere and the service is patchy at best for a restaurant with such a huge reputation.A great spot for a gourmet burger but the restaurant is lacking a certain 'something' for sure

I've now been to DBBM about three times in the past three months, and each time has turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Compared to the noisy, busy Mozza next door, this civilized place is a welcome relief. The prix fixe menu is a particularly good deal, while the main a la carte menu is quite reasonable too, given the quality you're getting. The service was the most pleasant surprise: it is great and not the stuffy, arrogant service you get in some French restaurants. It has a very extensive wine list, with some particularly good selection of Rhones. The only minor crib: the daily specials often run out by 8pm.

It was our last night in the 6 days family holiday in Singapore, and we arrive at the Marina Bay Sands at around 8pm. We were tired and hungry but wanting to enjoy a quality restaurant on our last night. We were happy we could get a table without reservation on Friday night. The restaurant was buzzing with excitement and very much alive. The service was excellent and they were full of smiles. I ordered the Boston Scallops with Risotto, and it was perfect. It was very fresh, my scallops were perfectly cooked and the risotto is so rich and tasty. My husband ordered the DB Burger with Foie Gras but he said it was a bit overrated. We had a wonderful evenin
5
this is definitely a place i'd return to. the ambience was nice, refined but not too snooty. the staff was so polite and accommodating. service was quick and impeccable. we were there just for coffee and dessert. we ordered a plate of macarons and bonbons, but the star of the show was the profiteroles. the presentation alone was inspired! the pastries came with a slab of dark chocolate balanced on top, and the server poured hot chocolate on it -- melting the slab and transforming everything into a gooey pool of YUM. would order it again in a heartbeat :)coffee and dessert for three people cost around S$70
5
In a city where service standards are wildly inconsistent and menus can require explanations DBBM is the no-brainer. Three adults and three teens enjoyed a 3 course pre-theatre dinner. Service, presentation and food were all flawless. The prices generally reflect that although there is a set menu option
5
Top cocktails, delicious food, amazing service
Could of offered a little more cheese in the cheese platter but it was delicious.
3
tried the burger which was OK. profiteroles that day was exquisite... but not great on the next visit.
5
Made reservations which was easy, our waiter was friendly and informative, though we only had water, he made sure our glasses were never half full, very atenttive, the burger and seafood caserole was cooked to perfection! The prices are also very reasonable. Will I come back.....in a heart beat...

This restaurant is part of the Daniel Bouloud group. Those who follow these things will know him as one of the celebrity chefs who is very disarming and not full of himself. I have tried his restaurants in New York and they have been universally good. This is billed as a mix of Lyonnaise and American cuisine, which makes for a pretty interesting set of dining choices. My partner and I opted for a couple of classic Lyon dishes and were not disappointed. We tend to be a bit critical of a lot of attempts at dishes like Coq au Vin, which can be hot or miss. This was perfect. We started with a pork rillette which also was correct down to the layer of pork fat on top. Cholesterol issues forgotten here! The wine list is what I call courageous having a few eines that are quirky. I tried the Priorat rose which went perfectly with everything. Now the real buzz here are the staff, especially a few of the female Philippine staff who seem to be well trained and can actually remember the soup of the day, know the menu well and can even discuss the wines. Amazing. it is a bit pricey but I guess that is the price for a rental in the Marina Bay Sands. Make it part of a general trip[ to see this Sands casino, which is OTT!
4
Spacious and pleasant restaurant. The service was attentive but at times chaotic. The APPETIZERS arrived before the drinks and wine which were only brought to the table upon demand!The Mesclun Salad with smoked duck breast was fresh and well dressed. The Assiette Lyonnaise was well presented and ideal for sharing.We ordered two of the RIBEYE steaks one was ordered rare the other blue both were delivered rare. The manager explained that it was difficult to serve it blue since the cut was too thin; having said that, the meat was of good and very well grilled. The accompanying Pommes Frites were fine also.The manager and his staff were charming and attentive
4
The tomato soup I had was very very good but the duck confit was just well, like any duck confit. My friend had the salad appetizer which was exactly the same as the one they serve with the mains. Desserts were very good...love the molten lava cake. No doubt overall, the food was good...quality ingredients, well put together. Nevertheless, I'm feeling that it somehow lacks the oomph factor. Service was just average, the servers need to smile more. Overall, I'm a little disappointed
5
As a chef, I was amazed by the presentation of their food and the variation that they offer. They gave me foodgasms! :) The place is very intimate and at the same time you can see the silhouette of the people in the kitchen. A must try is the DB Burger and the Hanger ( I might get this wrong. Sorry for the wrong spelling. ) and their Potato Duphonoise ! A MUST

For full review, you may refer to the blog here.http://rainfooddiary.blogspot.sg/2012/07/db-bistro-moderne.htmlI am quite satisfied with the food and services here. The complimentary bread basket served before the main course was fresh and very delicious. I dun know what butter that use but I love it.I love the wagyu steak and the side dishes. I got the lava chocolate which it could be better. But the Warm Madeleines are great
5
Friendly staffs and consistently good bistro meals. We have been there a few times and always happy with the experience. Fruit de mare has always been fresh and its hard to find similar qualities in Singapore. Hanger steak is back recently, another hard to find. My wife like the rissotto there and she doesn't usually order that. You can end your meal with some delicious soft magdelenes. We have tried lunch and afternoon tea (ala carte) too and they are as good. If you are looking for a meal slot in Marina Bay Sands, this is the one.

A 4 night stay in Singapore before we joined a cruise ship back to Perth via some great stops throughout Asia saw us visit this delightful French restaurant that I had reviewed on Trip Advisor earlier in the year.The food certainly did not disappoint my expectations-it was exquisite but make sure you take your cheque book to pay for the wine!!The service staff were very attentive, I even received a birthday cake for a birthday I was celebrating later in the weekThe only disappointment I had was with the location-in the middle of a huge shopping mall so no view except for the hundreds of people window shoppingAll in all I'm glad to have experienced Singapore in all it's glor
5
1st visit waited about 40 minutes, but they apologised and gave us a free dessert which was amazing
5
we ordered the signature burger, a yankee burger, and a steak. the signature burger was so good!!!!! and the yankee was just ok. I loved the steak served with bearnaise sauce.
4
Great food, awesome service, value, feels like you are not in a mall once you walk in the door.
5
Need I say more? Rib eye, median rare... Melts in your mouth... Bernaise sauce... Pommes frites... Great meal. Good service. Wines by the carafe were good...
4
I enjoyed this visit and had the pork chop which was fine, however the one a few days later nearby in pasta restaurant was better. It's funny I can't really remember what the others had, perhaps that says something?It's really a 3.5 not a 4 but it's a nice evening ou ith attentive service and Sinagapor prices
3
French cuisine with the possibility to choose also something light. There is a huge choice of wine (not only French ones) at different prices (not really cheap). It is located in a very huge mall (so no view, no garden), close to the casino and close the very tall hotel Marina Bay. The food and wine were good, as well as the service. I liked also the bread, some of which is served warm. The atmosphere is nice
4
family friendly... we arrived around 6pm so it was still fairly empty. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Serving size ok and was cooked the way we asked for it. Meat platter was filling, lamb was spicy and my son loved his steak.pricing ok, 9 out of 10 for the service on the night...can imagine it will get very busy as the night gets later
2
4 of us on a Saturday night. The place was packed. For starters we had the tomato soup which was good, foie gras - mediocre and heirloom tomato salad - average. For mains, 2 rib-eye steaks which were average (we have had better), an original db burger - was interesting with the short ribs but not mind blowingly good and duo of organic chicken - the chicken was very tender, this may have been the best dish. Souffle and ice cream for dessert - was okay as far as souffle and ice cream goes. Overall we were quite disappointed as our expectations of a DB restaurant was high
2
First impression when I saw the menu outside, this is a good french restaurant by DB that does not overcharged and it is always packed with people. This is the first DB restaurant that I've been to, so I'm very excited.We start with foie gras which is not so good, the crab salad is very ordinary. The main does not look that appealing, then when we tasted the food it is very bland and the souces combination just does not taste good. I asked for the best dessert they have, they suggested the pecan pie which according to the waiter is one on the favourite dish, but the fact is it just as ordinary as one served in street cafes.Definetely not worth the price and not coming back
2
Friends who had been to db Bistro Moderne twice before were very excited to take us to this place so perhaps we expected too much. I found the menu somehow very confusing and if you are allergic to fish as I am, the choice for a main meal is very narrow. Finally I chose the Frenchie hamburger on the grounds that if it was as good as people said, it should really knock my socks off. Sorry, but it did far from that. I couldn't finish it and was concerned that the meat was slightly 'off' from the taste. It wasn't, of course, but I found it bland, dry and poorly assembled. Compare this impression with the description in the menu: "The Frenchie Burger: Beef Patty Topped with Confit Pork Belly, Caramelized Onions, Morbier Cheese,Arugula, Cornichons,Served on a Black Pepper Bun". Who were they trying to kid? The accompanying fine cut chips were as you would expect and the ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise presented with it were as you would buy from the supermarket. So I had to ask myself: Where was the gourmet in this and why does it cost $26?The French onion soup I had to begin with had lashing of cheese and bread in it, but again the taste was very ordinary - my husband who also had the soup thought our homemade version much tastier. Perhaps the duck and seafood dishes are different, but I expect entire menus to sustain quality throughout, whether it be a hamburger or foie gras. It was an embarrassing evening in a way because our hosts were so delighted to take us yet the food was difficult to rave about in any way. The seats were not easy to get in or out of either. I would never return as I think it is extremely poor value for money and I would prefer to buy the ingredients and make it at home or go to McDonald's. Just think hard before visiting
5
Business as usuall at this Daniel Boulud's Singapore outpost.
Excellent as always.
4
I had DB burger but not impressed ... The meat was crumbling out. The oysters were fresh though.
5
I liked the Hanger Steak and the efficient and professional service. The rhubarb sorbet was a great palate cleanser.
5
Love it that they make an effort at presenting the food in style. The menu is also creative and innovative without being overboard. Freshness of the ingredients is another noteworthy point.
5
No better way to end a busy work day by biting into a mouth watering steak burger. The burgers in this place are out of this world! No kidding!
4
We went to DB with some friends. We had very good service and the food was really nice. I like the diner kind of atmosphere very much and therefore the prices are not overwhelmingly high. Really enjoyed it and will definetely go back!
4
From the "beginning" at the Marina Bay Sands, DB Bistro Moderne has been a hit with both locals and visitors. Excellent french bistro food with a twist served by experienced and well trained staff. From Oysters and Foie Gras, charcuterie and flan's to burgers and green salad's. Excellent open wine is served by the caraffe instead of by the glass. Probably the best Maitre'D's in Singapore..
5
To say the burger here is amazing is not doing it justice. The ingredients are top-notch, the cooking is perfection and the presentation is superb. But above all - the taste is fabulous.My husband and I were on a tight schedule as we had a flight to catch, and we were concerned about the time required as we knew this was a "name" restaurant. We chose to share two burgers - and were so glad we did. The staff were absolutely wonderful - they were very attentive and helpful, giving us advice on the menu and looking after us. Service level was high, as you'd expect, but extremely friendly and not snobby at all. We will certainly go back - for both a quick bite and a longer leisurely experience
4
We had lunch there this week and immediately had a feeling of being taken care off extremely well by our waiter. Very attentive, pro-active, communicative, in short: perfect! Food was very good, Tomato soup, the db Burger and Seafood Risotto, all to be recommended. I liked that fact that wine by the glass was also available in a 500ml carafe, a nice solution for not having a whole bottle. Not cheap, but worth the money
5
Amazing food! Try the burgers! Service was a little shaky. I think it is a fairly new place and not enough well trained staff. The general manager, was a oung girl called amy. And she dosnt seem like she is experienced enough to run a place like this. Pi, butthe food was nevertheless outstandin
5
one of the best dessert we have ever ate here , profiterolls with melted belgian chocolate is to die for. and a surprise greeting from Daniel Bouldoud tops the experience. The staffs are genuinely warm which is rare sometimes
4
For $40 I was expecting to be blown away but it was just good not great. Give me a Five Guys burger any day
5
My husband and I enjoyed a very pleasant 3 course meal. The food and wine were superb. the service was excellent without being too attentive. Would definitely recommend this place.
4
Try the famous burgers! Rest pf the menu was actually pretty ordinary.
5
I was traveling alone and sat at the bar. The staff was so lovely and waited on me hand and foot. My steak was cooked perfectly!

Please read full story here: www.epinosh.comI decided to try out db Bistro Moderne after hearing many good things about the restaurant. Arriving at 4 in the afternoon, the restaurant was only 15% filled with diners, probably due to brunch hours. The bistro looks elegant, dressed up in stylish hanging globes across the ceiling. Since it was brunch hours, the selection comes from the specific menu handed to us. (I tried to ask for dishes that's available in other meal times but was not successful, guess the kitchen was busy preparing for Sat's dinner) Had Fried Eggs Lyonnaise & Coq Au Vin for mains but special request for a side; Garlic Pommes Frites. To polish off the brunch, I ordered for Madeleines and assorted ice-creams; Cherry Blossom & Honey-Buttermilk sorbet. I opted out from the famous db burger as I read quite mixed reviews from many sources and thought I would skip this for my 1st attempt. Coq Au Vin arrived first and alongside with a bowl of  späetzle. The gravy was the highlight of the dish and you definitely need to drizzle those thickened sauce on the egg noodles to finish up wholly. However, I find the chicken a bit tough that day. It didn't cooked to real tender, a pity.Fried eggs lyonnaise, on the other hand, fared better than the renowned coq au vin! The duck confit was so well done that it was so soft and delicate (the fact that the duck meat was even tender than coq au vin's chicken drumsticks, makes me felt worst over it) and the caramelized onions add an extra sweetness to the meat. It was not gamey at all! The cubed potatoes embedded underneath the layer of cheese were equally delicious.   The garlic pommes frites were ordinary and not garlicky. They were unevenly salted as well. Not to be missed, you must try db's desserts! Warm Madeleines were to die-for! The 20 petit cakes wrapped in linen for warmth, appeared ballooning and lip-smacking....You may read the rest from: www.epinosh.co

My partner and I were going to just eat the burgers, but couldn't pass up the SGD48 3 course prix fixe menu at lunch, which allowed you to get their famous DB burger as a main for an extra SGD15.The entrees (I had the duck terrine and he had the salad) were delicious, the burger lived up to expectations and the desserts were simply divine. I can still remember the taste of the peanut butter pannacotta.The service was also good - our waiter was very attentive and filled up our wine glasses at the right moment. I suggest going for lunch when it's less crowded and you have the choice of having the prix fixe menu
4
Went there to entertain clients after a long day and it was really a fantastic choice. The environment is casual and not stuffy at all. The service is very attentive; refilling the bread basket several times and folding your napkin when you leave the table. The portions are generous and even though the food was ordinary, the sauce was "magic" . We went during a Thursday night and it wasn't crowded at all, the atmosphere was great.The food is pricey and don't think it's a place to bring kids really..
4
This place does classic bistro dishes in a modern setting. The prices are above average but not unreasonable. The decor itself is very nice but to be honest, eating inside a shopping mall doesn't exactly scream elegance or class but then again its Singapore where the shopping mall is kind of a natural environment to be eating in as would a bistro in an open Parisian plaza somewhere. The food was technically very good, everything was cooked to perfection. The Salmon tasted fresh, I could taste the sea (in a good way). The steak was cooked fine but I would criticise the quality of the meat - maybe I'm spoiled being from Australia where we get quality beef for reasonable prices but the meat could have been more tender - it certainly wasn't anything a chef could save, just the produce. I've had sirloin steak before which was far easier to chew and cut with a knife - it wasn't a nightmare but less than expected. The escargot was very nice also. I can't fault DB Bistro because everything was done right except for the average steak quality - I'd definitely give it another shot and try something else on the menu

From the six culinary masters, we chose to dine at the more casual bistro of Daniel Boulud, DB Bistro Moderne. DB Bistro Moderne is a contemporary French-American restaurant where traditional French cuisine meets the flavors of the American market. Chef Boulud is also said to have elevated the simple burger into an art form.Burger as a work of art? I'm sold!Before the burgers, we ordered a few dishes (Roasted John Dory, Casserole Espagnole) and all were well-received.It was just too bad that the burgers didn't live up to its hype. Art is definitely was not! The Yankee Burger was a dry boring mess, and the only good thing I can say about the Frenchie burger is that it's juicy. I also wanted to love the signature burger of db (the original db burger) but simply couldn't. I hardly tasted the foie and the flavors were nothing special. I could get this kind of burger at any decent burger joint in any city. While I don't believe in regrets, a better option would probably have been Mario Batali's Pizzeria Mozza. The place was always packed and reviews have been outstanding. Price wise, it's reasonable too.For more on my DB experience, do vist: http://gluttonanonymous.blogspot.com/2011/10/burgers-of-daniel-boulud.htm

It is difficult to resist going to this restaurant when visiting mbs even if bistro moderne is expensive. Staff is nice, smilling. Burger are very good. There is a nice 65++ set lunch.
3
The burger was fine. The rest of the food so, so. I would have probably enjoyed dining at the food court more.
4
Have been here for lunch a few times now (not for dinner yet), the service has always been very good, the choice of meals outside of the famous burgers is quite wide. They were willing to take into account dietary requirements. The wine selection is good enough for the food presented. Definitely recommen
5
Went there with a party of 7 on Friday night and the place was packed. Thanks goodness we had a reservation.We went absolutely starving and after our meal, I needed a wheelbarrow to wheel me out of the establishment. "I'm stuffed" was a comment common amongst all of us.Excellent ambiance. Although the place was buzzing, we could have decent conversations without having to shout. For starters, we had a fantastic Seafood platter. One of the members in the party is a regular and he made this comment, "It is Christmas all over again" and having sampled the various offering in the platter, I could not agree with him more.For the main, we had the Brittany Turbo and organic beef. Both were cooked to perfection. For the sides, we had Potatoes Au Gratin and Brussels sprouts. Although I am not a fan of Brussels sprout, on this occasion, I even had a second helping. Weird how food cooked well has this strange effect on people.By the time desserts came we were all struggling to put away any more but the Coffee Profiterole were just too good to pass up.The service was excellent and the recommendations from the service staff were spot on.Will definitely go back there soon, this time perhaps we will be a bit more judicious with what we order. I want to be able to walk out of that place rather than roll away......

We liked Maison Boulud in Beijing and finally found time to visit db Bistro Moderne in Singapore. We called for reservation. The reservation was handled very professionally. As we entered the hotel, we were showed to our table without any wait. It was already 1:30 pm which probably help.We had oysters to start and ordered the steak, the seafood casserole and the NY burger. The food was served promptly and were all very tasty and delicious. Oyster was fresh and very juicy. With the vinagerette, it was just perfect. My son enjoyed his steak. It was cooked medium. The Seafood casserole was the hit dish. My wife and son partook in the casserole. The spanish chorizo provided a great flavor to the clams, mussels and shrimp. The burger was also cooked just as we liked it. The lunch was capped by the madeline courtesy of the restaurant. We asked about it was this was the surprise we always looked forward to in Maison Boulud in Beijing. The madelines were delicious - just right crispiness on the outside and softness on the inside. the tinge of lemon helped the freshness of the dessert
4
Having eaten at Daniel's in NYC we happened upon db bistro by accident but knew we had to get a burger. I had the db burger and my wife had the Yankee burger. Service was great and the food was excellent. Met the Manager and Assistant Manager. Very nice
4
Located in the new Marina Bay Sands, db bistro moderne is a bit high class to be called bistro in the Parisian sense. Prices are also a couple of steps above its French namesake. That being said, the food is excellent, with fancy presentation (unlike Paris).There are clear signs of adaptation to local expectations though - the 0.5l beer glass, characteristic of a German Hefeweizen seemed unusually small. No wonder, there was no room for the traditional crown of foam. Asians/Americans think that foam is a waste of beer and would rather have the glass filled to the brim
5
DB has really good foie gras - both kinds on the menu are excellent choices. pastas are really filling and pretty good. the burgers are a good choice too, the portion looks small but it's really filling with the fries. excellent service from all the staff at DB too

A couple of us who have visited Singapore, from Melbourne, have decided to try out fine dining in Singapore.At the start, we were all amazed by the service. Waiters were friendly and helpful. And the Pinot that I ordered was great! The Appetizer were all amazing and I was especially enjoying the egg salad. However, nightmare started as the Mains were served to us. The CASSEROLE ESPAGNOLE was like a typical Singaporean dish. Maybe the food is tailored for the Singaporean, therefore it is reasonable why it was spicy and impressionably flavoured. Both the Pike and Salmon dishes were overcooked and salty. The risotto that was served with the Pike was not even fully cooked! Lastly, the texture Duo Of Organic Yellow Chicken was good. It was soft but not dry for a chicken breast. However, the sauce was too salty.Wild Mushroom Coulis and Turnips were overcooked and was cooked with too much salt and butter. It was so bad that I could not even finish my food! The mashed potatoe tasted like it was only made with butter! We were very unimpressed with the Mains and decided to let the waiter know. The young man who served us was very appreciative and even thank us for our feedbacks. However, we also did see him informing his manager about it and all the manager did was gave him a shrug on the shoulder! There was no apologies and nothing at all! We were all very upset with the meal we had. Especially the way we were treated! At the start of our meal, we had noticed that there were a couple of tables that were given extra attention to. And every time the tables were served with anything at all, there will always be a manager with them. So maybe walk-in customers are not as important as the "VIPs"?! This was a bad experience of fine dining in Singapore. So much for 3 Michelin stars
5
I did visit DB Bistro before and always had a very good experience .This time , on a Monday , i was extremely pleased when the manager told us that that the chef had decided to us on a culinary journey to his homeland (Alsace ).We had a excellent snail and chicken oyster fricasse , and as main course the best choucroute i ever ate !!!!! a superb Kirsch souffle as dessert . I understand it s every monday for a few month..so do not miss it !
4
One of the best burgers I've tasted - the db burger plus the prices are very reasonable. plus, a great location for a restaurant, being the marina bay sands. Definitely worth a visit
3
Clearing plates too quickly, topping up wine too quickly: being rushed (out?) while dining.... What a shame for the otherwise nicely decorated restaurant and excellent food.
5
I believe a great dining experience must include good food, ambience and the spirit in which it was served. DB Singapore has exactly all that which was missing from the Singapore food scene since La Brasserie bistro closed when marco polo hotel ceased operations. Feeling somewhat hungry we had the lobster salad and NY burgers ; the Frenchie burger and the original which were both equally succulent and delicious (they have 3 on the menu) accompanied by true french fries. We polished the barley creme brulee, presentation of which was like zen architecture tasting just right to complete my meal. Try also their decadent profiteroles in rich dark choc sauce - generously served and enough for two. Rave point to take away: My coffee was asked to be served with my dessert. The waitress on noticing that i have not touched my coffee since, proceeded to change a fresh piping hot coffee for me. Now how is that for invaluable thoughtful service without being asked in Singapore! Definitely coming back this weekend

Located in the prestigious Marina Bay Sand, Daniel Boulu's restaurant is classy in the French bistro way; the table's disposition offers a certain intimacy to the customers who can seat down on red leather banquettes. The decoration is polished in the baroque style and the dishes proposed are simple and refined. I had the Tarte Fine Provencale at $20 as starter and it has a real taste of France. The Provence is an area in France where we can find special aromatic herbs simply called "Provencal herbs". These herbs go well with tomatoes and meat; it is largely put on pizzas and this Tarte Fine Provencale offered exactly what we expect. Concerning the main course, I had the Homemade Potato Gnochi at $34 at first when I went there. Well, if you want to try honest Italian food, don't go to a French restaurant! My Gnochi were huge and unshaped what was not appetizing. Anyway, to be sure to not make any mistakes, I had the db burger on my second visit and it was completely satisfying. I really had the feeling to eat an authentic freshly made burger and it was a heavy meal.As a dessert, we shared the Warm Madeleines with our coffee. It was really soft and tasty with a hint of vanilla. Madeleines are small cakes with a shell shape. A woman named Madeleine would have distributed those cakes to pilgrims on their way to St Jacques de Compostelle. She baked these cakes in a scallop, what is the pilgrim's emblem and gave this special shape to the Madeleines. The service was faultless, the staff refills your basket of bread as many time as you wish, what is really appreciated in a French restaurant!To conclude, The Bistro Moderne offers an ambiance that is representative of the traditional French bistro in a refined way.

If you're in the Marina Bay Sands and are looking for a meal before the theatre which is literally just across the way, you couldn't do better than this charming bistro. Having enjoyed Danial Boulod's excellent restaurant in Beijing I wondered how a Singapore setting in an ultra modern complex might fare. Why did I worry? It was a delightful experience and echoed the attention to detail of Beijing while creating a very relaxed atmosphere where pre-theatre goers mingled with families and tourists. Singapore has an informal way of life in general and this bistro has captured that essence but with the highest standards possible.Our two course set dinner (well OK we couldn't help adding a shared dessert afterwards!) was imaginative, beautifully presented and served with good wine. For me the hallmark of Daniel Boulode's restaurants is the superb service. By this I mean that the serving staff are always aware of what the customers need. It's never obtrusive but rather like being in the home of an excellent host or hostess.Don't miss this if you're in the area

I love it more and more every time.Consistency is what most restaurants lack these days. Not this place. Service just keeps getting better and more personal.This time around it was a dinner with the missus. She loved it as well.We ordered the Munster Flambee & Asiette Lyonaise to start with followed by the Organic Pork Loin for two. It was amazing. The Sauerkraut is to die for.We had a bottle of Huellas from priorat - it was recommended by the restaurant's sommelier Arant (he told us how it is a wine made by two sommeliers and that one of them came to visit the restaurant) . He kept it within our price range and didn't try and up sell a more expensive option like the neighbours have over a few dinners. Great choice of wine by the way - thanks arant.Special thanks goes out to Rajin for looking after us so well. True Pro.Also Loic is brilliant at the door. I think it was him recognising us at the door that led to us getting the madelines in the end. We weren't feeling like dessert that day but how can one say no to those nasty little things.Finally I must thank the chef. Amazing food as always.see you all soon
5
I went here with my friends before going for the wicked show. the service was great for me. no racism, the old female waitress was totally great, beside the young man waitress act like he own the world, and only pay attention to the Caucasian guests. food was great, the foie gras cook perfectly well and its not small for the price. the burger also nice. they have great selection of wine as well. no byob here.overall, this is one of my fav restaurant for catching up with friends, sitting there for one or two hour with friends. its a nice decent place. where you can have a nice food, and you dont need to dress up well. and oh save a space for the dessert, they have a wonderful dessert as well
5
Experience was great not too dressy but the food and service were first class. Can't fault any of the 3 courses we had. The wines were a bit pricey starting at $55 for a carafe! Would help if they had several lower priceAussie wines . Overall a meal for a cost S$200 incl wine so very good value for this level of food
5
We visited late on a Saturday evening and after being given a rude brush off by another restaurant a few doors along the reception we experienced here was first class. Every person we dealt with was polite, approachable and showed how good service can be when done correctly. The menu may not have been as extensive as some, but all the meals we had were well cooked and beautifully presented. Given this experience we can't recommend it highly enough

It' was the third time we back at DB Bistro Modern, but for sure the last one.On our previous visit we never tried the DB burger before; then after a visit at the art and science museum we went to DB to try the famous burger, we were two so we tried the Classic French one also.Unfortunately for us both were tasteless and the meat was not so good (patty was huge and foie gras minuscule and for one of them the meat was dry) The french fries were not home made and the sauces were very classical (mustard, ketchup and "chemical"mayo)The positif of DB was our salad appetizer a nice and light mache, arugula (maybe too much) and endive salad topped with vinaigrette and sliced black truffle, simple, tasty and fresh like we us to eat in France. For the dessert we share a "Malt" as they said on the menu: it was supposed to be a crème brulée with a Bailey's ice cream, and chocolate ganache...we never found the taste of the Bailey's and the ganache was so poor...tasteless and grainy...bweurk!The smiling lady who serve us was good and helpful, we really appreciate her service.Very disappointed about the food this time, so we don't feel like going back again..

Whilst there was nothing which we could particularly complain about - the experience was just average. Food was OK, but did not 'wow' us and the service was solid, but not spectacular.
5
We often go to Sin , and always try to go to the Bistro, the food is always good as the services. thanks.

I have been to the resturant a few times, the food is good I should say, but the service is not that pleasant. The staff are a bit "hostile", not keen on service.... I actually enjoy the food there, even their dessert, the crepe is nice with berry sauce. The food is fresh, but a bit pricy, i.e., lunch for 2 including drinks, meal and dessert is well over S$150. Too many buts..... so up to individual to decide if it is worth i

It was a last minute decision to dine at db Bistro. We walked in without reservations but because we managed to get a table immediately. We would have preferred that the host behaved more professionally but we have since had this feedback addressed by the management of db Bistro.The food was alright, nothing to shout about. We did not try the burger which had great reviews because we do not take beef. We decided to have our drinks at Fuse Bar @ MBS Hotel instead as we were not too pleased with the service.Will we be back? Probably not

DB Bistro Moderne has 5 star service but some of the menu descriptions are misleading. The restaurant is located in the Marina Bay sands hotel. This is an often busy hotel & shopping mall, and is large enough to demand its own zip code (post code). Three of us went for dinner, 2 adults & 1 child. We ate light, yet the total bill was SGD133 (incl taxes & servcie charge). One glass of very nice sparkling white SDG27, small shrimp & crab meat salad SDG30 (average taste), one Yankee burger - good for kids SGD26, veal & mash potato with salad SGD49. The veal was actually veal sausages which had an unusual taste. This was misleading as the menu made no mention of sausages. It's a nice but busy atmosphere (on Saturday nights), the food was a BIG let down. I think chef has gotten ahead of himself & some of his dishes are not explained in enough detail on the menu. Won't be going backto this eatery

The was our third visit to db bistro. First two times the food was amazing and the service completely on par with western expectations. This time....it's was if the cleaning staff was cooking the meal. Every single selection and course (can you believe it)?? Tasted terrible. The fois gois was over cooked, the steak had no flavor it might have been yesterday's meat, and the Madeline's were burned. I am appalled and would be even more critical if it was wasn't for our Server and the Floor Manager. Bless them they did the best they could to recover from a bad meal. Db Bistro..keep your servers and floor managers and FIRE your chef!

Dined here on January 12. We have eaten in many restaurants in Europe, USA, Asia and Australia and this ranks with best of them. We were given great service with our waiter knowing when to approach us. The warm variety of rolls with a delicious seafood pate brought to us before ordering was most welcome. The food throughout was very well presented and cooked and all very tasty. The Tarte Flambee and The Tarte Fine Provencale for starters were both excellent. For main course my wife had a veal dish and I had steak frites. Both were cooked exactly to our order and well presented and again delicious.A shared dessert, Pomme, finished off what was an excellent meal. As I said earlier our waiter Jeffrey was very good and made our night even better

Visiting Marina Bay Sands shopping centre is a must when you are in Singapore. And part of the experience is that when shopping you will get hungry and need to eat. This is not your Mc Donald's experience. They are gourmet, quite small, but amazing taste and well worth it
5
My wife and I came here for a second time on New Years Eve and had the taster menu. It was excellent quality, our waiter was great and the whole night was a an excellent way to see 2012 in.The prices are on the high side, but not removed from it's neighbouring restaurants in the Sands and all said and done, I think it is worth it!We will definitely be returning
3
Actually liked it a lot. If you go shopping to the Marina Bay Sand and you're not sure where to eat, this is the place.I had an amazing original cheeseburger with foie gras inside the burger (really inside the meat). Good french fries. Good bread. Daniel Boulud's has a good thing going on there, he managed to fuse American-French Style really well.
1
Terrible service left a really bad taste in our mouths. We spoke briefly to the manager - a young American woman who had no idea how to manage the restaurant!! Not ever coming back!
4
You have to pay a big attention to the menu before ordering!
The best, but the most expensive beef i had in my entire life.
6 oz for 180 SD...
5
Anazing food, great service. Have to try the burgers!
3
my friend was having birthday as he is a big fan of French cuisine and so he decided to celebrated in DB. well, the atmosphere is nice typical brasserie where the table is near to each other.the food was good but then comparing to my previous dining experience in Rostang, Paris of course it's different. overall, everything were ok. hopefully it could be better in the next visit
5
I have been to DB Bistro numerous times. DB Bistro is a wonderful restaurant serving the most consistent and amazing dishes - but you have got to visit it more than once as the DB Burger is a must try on your first visit. Amazing duck confit, steak frites, and their seafood dishes are very well prepared. Of course, their desserts are something not to be missed - Profiteroles (I still haven had better yet), and their freshly made madelines are excellent with the after dinner cuppa! Service is excellent and the staff is amazing! The only downside - the pricing is a tad on the high side as it caters to casino patrons. But well worth it
2
Had dinner at DB the other night and expected quite a feast after having been to the one in New York, but this place is not great at all. Service was extremely slow: we were seated and so was another party at the table next to us, who received their appetizers while we had not even seen the menu - we had to ask for it a few times and after receiving lunch menus eventually got the dinner menus. The appetizers of charcuterie and foie gras were good, but the main courses (most of us went for the db Burger) were disappointing. The burgers were ok, but not as tasty as in NY, and the fries were just awful! They were of the kind that are served at any average restaurant (or tasted just like that), soft and bland. This is not what I expect to get for 38 SGD...Overall a disappointment for a lot of money. I wonÂ´t be back..

Dined here on a friday night, wasnt full but some places love telling you they have to check the books and take time flicking through an empty list when the place is half empty. Once it was established that there wouldnt be a last minute influx of fatcats with non-existent bookings we were led to our table. The decor was very nice, and service was largely good. The food however, was average, a starter of Tuna belly had five or six tiny slivers of fish the thickness of carpaccio, which was ludicrously overpriced at $40; yes I know tuna belly is expensive but that was just ridiculous, fine dining or not, and this aint fine dining. The db burger was quite good and the highlight of the night but nowhere near the one in NY. The duck confit wasnt bad, and neither was the casserole espagnole but they werent great either. With a bottle of water and tip the bill came to S$95 a head. For two courses and without "drinks" it was laughable, especially for a bistro. To be fair the rent is expensive, the ingredients are imported and there are plenty of punters with fat wallets happy to pay, but the food didnt quite live up to the price

Having heard of Chef Daniel Boulud's reputation,it was an honour to be invited to dine there after watching a Musical. Location,at the heart of the MBS Shoppe where passerbys could actually look through but this is forgiven,as i realised that it's a Bistro joint after all. But is being Bistro the reason why nobody SMILED? Or was it because we were the last guests to arrive thus everyone looked angry? Door Host esp was rather snobbish and so was the wait staff whom walked past setting the other tables looking pretty angry probably as we were "culprits" to end his shift even later. With the exception of this lady server,who was kind enough to ask if we'd like some desserts after we finished the mains. That was already 11pm and I believed that was why she looked jaded and a little unkempt. We ordered the madelaines and a couple of the simpler ones. Food on the other hand,was def above average. The only complaint will be that the generous-portion of a FOIE GRAS lacked richness and flavour and felt like it was of a low quality grade. The Duck Terrine was rather well cooked and tender,and my partner's Shaved White Truffle Risotto (it was that evenig's specials) was nothing short of magnificent.Other than that,DB at MBS was really a BISTRO after all,so please lower your expectations and you might enjoy the (BISTRO) experience....

It's d place to be ! Kudos to all d db staff and ESP to the bartender ( I dunno what his name , he's a skinny lookin like a Korean ? With a long hair ) he recommend good food and the best wine pairing.

DB Bistro Moderne does offer high quality and truly modern French bistro cuisine - all within a very 'hip' yet relaxed ambience. The portion sizes are good, and the staff is attentive, effective and friendly. Even though the restaurant is in the middle of the MBS Shoppes complex, the place does offer a cozy atmosphere - and with respect to the food offerings available the 'real French deal'. We had a superb 'coq au vin' and a great soup for starters - as well as a perfect sorbet for dessert. Nevertheless, all this comes at a price. So, if you do want to indulge in a truly "noveau francais" style dinner experience - you cannot go wrong with DB Bistro Moderne. Just make sure to bring daddy's/mommy's credit card along

did i mention it was expensive? drinks insanely priced but it's all about location.
5
This place never failed to impress. Food and service are good. And nice atmosphere. Waiters are attentive and helpful but not intrusive.
5
My second time at the restaurant.walked in - got acknowledged that i was a repeat customer in a very warm and welcoming manner by the sharply dressed host.i was entertaining clients this time around therefore had requested for a more private table. the table assigned to us was the very last in the restaurant and was perfect.from the moment we sat down we were taken on a dining experience. we were first brought a flambee compliment of the chef. i would imagine this was because i was a repeat customer. Thanks chef.then we were recommended by our server (Risa - Very profesional and efficient by the way) to enjoy some of the specials that the restaurant had on. We ordered the Kagoshima Carpaccio, Nantucket Bay Scallops (a Daniel classic apparently), Cervelle de canut salad (another daniel speciality according to our server), Pate en corute (my choice - yummy) and a grilled foie gras. Now those were just the appetisers.for mains we had a turbot from britanny (awesome), kagoshima ribeye, a coq au vin and risotto with white truffles. these were all served family style to share. Sublime.....desserts kind of fell flat as compared to the rest of the meal. I mean they were awesome bu the rest of the meal was just better. it could also be that were were a bit full and couldn;t really appreciate them appropriately. will be back to try just desserts one of these days.we started with a bottle of white recommended by the host who greeted us at the door - a 100% chenin blanc from loire valley - Clos du pappilon - was surprised by the wine a little bit. it was better than i expected it to be and went very well with our appetisers. Then we moved on to a very peculiar wine something i had never tried before - a grape varietal called blaufrankisch which was blended with pinot noir. This wine from italy was a winner with all on the table.All in all not a great meal rather an outstanding one.one regret though - i wish we had tried the seafood platter. it looked amazing when it was served to the table next to us.will be back.To db team,Thank you very much
5
I thought DB Bistro Moderne was delish! The DB Burger (I think that's what it was called) was the most expensive burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating, but well worth it! Stuffed with short ribs and foie gras, served in a French-bistro atmosphere...how could that be anything but great? Highly recommended
4
If you had enough from Asian food, you may want to come here for a nice and cozy bistro style diner. The Foie Gras on brioche was excellent, the pumpkin soup perfect, the fresh mussels were nicely done and a very speedy and hospitable service. On top you have a good choice of wonderful wines. I would go again
2
What I hoped was a romantic evening out turned into a mess!First off the dining area was messy and felt like a diner rather than an upscale restaurant. The server brought us the wrong soup and I had to ask for bread 3 times.I have to say my venison was good but my wife's lobster cam out undercooked and came up much later than my main course. For 80 dollars, you would think they could cook a lobster right. Not once the manager come by to apologize or offer any type of compensation for the fiasco.Don't waste your time and money as there are much better options at Marina bay Sand
4
The place appears fancy and snooty but it's not. This is a nice place to have lunch or dinner and talk with your friends. It's not crowded, and not noisy. You feel relaxed here. If you sit by the window, you can watch shoppers as they go by while sipping wine and having an appetizer. I had the scallops, which is a bit salty and the sauce heavy for me. But no worries. The squash soup was plentiful. The frisee salad was delicious. My dad had the confit, which he said was addictive (and tasted better than the confit of Leal's in NY). My wife had the seafood casserole, which was a lot too. The seafood melted in your mouth. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake, which tasted like souffle and was sinfully good. The vanilla ice cream was homemade i think and was delicious. It was great also that the receptionist offered to store our shopping bags before entering so we weren't hassled with our bags. It was nice also that they serve wine in carafe, so it is not as large as a bottle, but just right for 3 people. I will certainly come back to try the Frenchie Burger
5
My really best "Sea-Food Platter" prepared by Executive Chef Stephane, so beautifull that I had to take a picture of it, so fresh and tasty, without to mention the great TAVEL rose (my favorite!) which I decided to pair with ! Great service with smily and sincere staff... Magnifique, a must in Daniel Boulud's great list of restaurants
5
The Foie Gras on Brioche. Orgasmic.The Beef was done just nice and pink. The Charcuterie platter divine. Coupled with a bottle of Gevrey-Chambertin 2006 and good friends, I was transported back to France, if only for that evening.Amazing service. Thanks Loic and Stephane and the crew

This 'famous" chef labeled restaurant seems like the landlord gave away the space for a "name" and the "name" pays little to no attention to the details because the 'name' has little to no investment in the success - which one expects at this price point from this chef. I'm generally easy to please - the food has to come out hot, be interesting to look at and have some taste. Our table of 7 ordered a wide range of dishes - only to have most meals fail on several of the basics. The only thing worse was the service - which would rather hide then deal with a meal that wasn't hot or cooked right. There are many choices in Singapore - go here only if you want to be underwhelmed and pay a small fortune
3
Beautiful atmosphere. Service spotty. Food incredibly rich, but a welcome change if you've been eating nothing but southeast asian food...
4
Although we didnt actually attend the show, the Pre Show Menu did the trick. Included was a reasonable glass of wine plus 3 courses.
Quality was excellent and was great value, i would recommend this to others.
5
Not a cheap option but truly delicious.
We all chose diifferent things, but there was not a poor plate.
The prawn salad and the profiterols were particularly good.
Highly, highly recommneded.
4
This is a little touch of France in Marina Bay. Excellent bistro food and wine list to match. Well priced for the location. The service was not perhaps in line with the rest. Nothing terrible but not brilliant. We would however go back and give it another try.
4
Great value set lunch menu offered on weekdays. Food was modern French and good. However hostess at the door was horribly unfriendly and showed us to a small table tightly squeezed in between other guests. When we asked if we could have one of the many empty tables by the window, she gave us that `look', and asked us to wait at the reception area again. After about 5 minutes, she showed us to one of the nicer window tables and walked away without uttering a word. This was already 1.30 pm and hardly anyone else came in for lunch after us. Luckily our server was friendly and knowledgable.We would recommend this restaurant for their good value weekday lunch deals

After having Sunday brunch at the original DB Bistro Moderne in New York City (which was out of the world!), we were looking forward to dinner at the newly opened Singapore branch while visiting the city. Of course we wanted to try the Original dB burger this time and 3 of us had that and one of my friends decided to go for the Frenchie Burger. After all the hype, I was frankly a bit disappointed. Both burgers were good but nothing wow and nothing I would really want to try again. The fries were however to die for! Overall a good experience since the service was excellent and the decor and ambience was perfect. Location itself was not great since you find it in the Shopping Mall itself and so misses out on the glamour factor. Try it out once and then look for another new place to try
5
We lucked upon this restaurant today and it was sensational! The food and service was amazing. Its definitely not one of the cheapest restaurants but in saying that it wasn't as expensive as we thought it would be for the quality of food, can't wait to go back! It was my favourite restaurant in Singapore and we did try quite a few
5
Highly recommend the famous house burger. Juicy, tasty with great fries. Bloody Mary had a great tobasco kick! Rounded up with the warm Madelines which was a great ending. They have a very interesting dinner menu too, worth a repeat visit.Wait staff serving us was totally indifferent. Didn't even bother telling us about the daily specials which we had to overhear from another table. When he first came to our table to take our order, he was half munching some food!! Other than that, highly recommended
5
My husband had a conference at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and while I was fortunate enough to make the trip, I was alone quite a lot. One evening in particular, I took my book and went for a solo dinner at DB. I was extremely impressed with this mostly French cuisine with a slight American twist - in every aspect from the knowledge of the staff, to the service, and to the food and food presentation. So impressed that my husband and I went back together our last night in Singapore. Both meals were excellent and we were treated wonderfully. Yes, it's a "celebrity chef" restaurant at the Marina Bay, so not a cheap meal, but I found it to be reasonably priced when compared to the other celebrity chef restaurants. Chris and his team are doing a phenomenal job. Keep up the good work
5
Had lunch here today and had a great time! Sat at the bar and enjoyed a wicked cloudy Swiss larger beer in frosted glasses; some very decent Bloody Marys, and then a good value Argentian Malbec which complimented the excellent DB Burger (a Must try!!). Really lovely decor & ambiance!Bravo!!(We'll be back for dinner soon!
4
Had dinner prior to the Lion King show at the Sands Theatre. Great food and wonderful service. The grilled foie gras is excellent.
3
Food was very average, burgers are like mini burgers at a buffet. Dont go here if your hungry. Not cheap either.
5
We looked for a good restaurant over by the Marinia Bay Sands complex and came across DB Bistro Moderne. From the time we entered to the time we left it was an outsanding experience. We were fortunate enough to arrive when they had a 3 course special for $68 Sing that ran from 4:30 pm until 7:00 pm. The meal included a glass of wine, caesar salad, steak au poivre with scalloped potatoes and asparagas, and a dessert. First let me say that the red wine they served with the meal was just unreal. It was a Chateau Mas Nuef Costieres De Nimes Compostelle 2005 and it was surpurb. I hope I can find it in the states. The steak au poivre was delicious. The service and atmosphere were top notch. There is nothing I can say that is bad about our entire experience that evening. If you are in Singapore, this restaurant is a must
3
Went there just before watching the Lion King performance. They were kind of slow with food although the place is overly busy. In sense service was kind of inefficient..food wise ..decent to good .way over priced though, especially the wines. Most celeb restaurants at MBS are way overpriced, this one is no differen
5
Came here with my wife for a valentine's day brunch in February 2011. Food was great for brunch and the atmosphere was ideal as well. Ordered their famous db burger, which is kinda small for my standards, but tasty nonetheless. Definitely something to worth trying (seem to be made with more attention as to compared to other burgers that I have tried and trust me, I have tried a lot!). Wife had a minute steak and she loves the small potatoes (sides) that comes with the dish. Also ordered an appetizer, which I don't really remember what it is called (a platter with all meat slices), which both of us thoroughly enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch for anyone
4
I had the The Frenchie Burger and hubby had the Heirloom Tomato Salad.My burger was delish! Loved the touch of the pork confit on my beef pattie! Although I think it was on the small side (which was the perfect size for me cuz I don't eat too much. I was even able to share a bit with hubby). But I'd like to think someone with a healthier appetite would not be as satisfied.Hubby loved his salad. It was quite fresh and seasoned wonderfully. Very tasty.Service was efficient, and quick. Our orders were promptly taken and delivered (although we did have to follow up our Coke). The only negative experience we had was they charged us for bottled water which we didn't have (although the waitress first insisted we did, I was adamant we didn't)
4
My wife and I spent a relaxing afternoon at DB bistro moderne. Despite we arrive slightly earlier, the font of house staff manage to get us a decent table by the window. We decided to order A la carte Original DB burger and a set lunch which I think well worthy for it price. The freshness of the food and the tenderness of the meat amazes us. We truly enjoy ourself and I believe we will come back to try the rest of the food in the menu
5
My friends who are Australian wine merchants wanted to visit db Bistro Moderne because they had such a good experience at Daniel Boulud’s db Bistro Moderne on West 44th Street in New York City. We arrived for dinner at about the same time as the theatre crowd who were going to see the Lion King. The bistro had a special theatre menu, but we ordered from the main menu. The atmosphere was clean, friendly, and neat with a red candle on each table and large open windows along the mall walkway. We found that they had a superb wine list with some very fine (and more expensive) wines for connoisseurs. I ordered their famous hamburger which was unusually tasty. My friends started with mesclun salads and duck pate with glasses of 2009 Anjou Loire Valley Chenin Blanc. With their steak frites they had glasses of 2009 Bordeaux Cru Bourgeois. They found the sommelier delightfully knowledgeable and helpful. The meal was so delicious that we had to linger for ice cream and sherbet with tea. We could not help observing the professionalism of the staff and the quality of output from the kitchen. As my friend said, “You’ll rarely have a bad meal if you choose a restaurant that has a name to protect.” Considering that every bite was a taste treat, the meal was well worth the price. You can't go wrong at db Bistro Moderne
4
One of the many great restaurants in the Marina Bay Sands complex. We went for a quick meal after arriving in Singapore. I'm not sure if it was just my taste buds recovering from the plane food, but the steak frites here was an exceptional piece of meat beautifully cooked. A showcase for great produce cooked well. My wife had a fish dish that was also wonderfully executed
5
This is one of the better places in Singapore.From the moment we approached the reception till the moment we left it was just the right amount of service. Not too indulgent and yet everything was where it needed to be at the right time. I mean wine was poured in the right amount at the right time. When the napkin fell down it was replaced before we even knew it. This is very rare in Singapore. That's me being modest.These kind of things matter a lot to my wife and me.We were having a relaxing evening dinner and they assessed that very well and we were not rushed at all at any point.That was the Synopses.I don't want to bore any one with details but there were a few things that are worth mentioning.The overall experience was amazing but we thought the following things could improve:- the music (strange selection)- the lighting (could be dimmer)- the tables were a bit shaky (perhaps need maintenance work)Besides that there wasn't anything that we didn't like. The Wagyu when served was beautifully presented (family style).We will go back again for sure.And ya I had this cocktail "a nick in thyme" if i remember it correctly. It was interestingly good. Not something i would have expected from a tequila drink.That's all I got
5
I was very pleased with restaurant ,
Food is good , nice service , not very noisy and the price is quite ok for what you get in your plate.
4
Everything is way, way overpriced - but that's Singapore. Would go again though.
3
Food here is very true and as good as the other db outlets around the world.
The prices and limited menu is why this gets an average rating for me
4
...even the service is not bad. Prices, like everything else in Marina Bay are outrageous. You can find some good values on the wine list if you know where to look (unlike others in the complex). Daniel did well here.
5
Highly recommend this restaurant... I had the tuna salad nicoise (tuna cooked 2ways w quail egg and white anchovies). It was light and v tasty. I then had the escargot and chicken oyster fricassee with spatzle. It was unusual but tasty w great variety of textures. raspberry lemonade was great. I highly recommend the chocolate souffle. It was a true revelation of bitter choc, not too sweet. Amazing.....Service was warm, attentive, caring, unobtrusive... Extremely good. SG 90, including tax and service. All in all I can highly recommend this restaurant
5
Go for the DB Burger. At the Marina Bay Sands, this burger will set you back about $50US including a Coke. The braised rib and different textures makes it very tasty, though I don't think I'd spend $50 on a burger again. Comes with ries. They brought out a complimentary dessert of fresh, hot Madeleines afterward which was a great touch
4
made reservations for a party of 8 but had 1 additional guest last minute and the staff were very nice to change us to a bigger table.I had the steak and it was very nicely seasoned with fabulous bernaise sauce, fries was only ok tho but my guest who had the burger said it's one of the best he's had and he's australian, so that must count for something.at less than $50 for a steak in such a nice restaurant with such great service, I must say I am pleasantly impressed. We spent a little over $600 for a party of 9, including a few beers, no wines
5
A welcome addition to the dining scene of Singapore. This is my first visit and I am amazed at the warm service from the waiting staff. My wife ordered the famous DB original burger and I went for the Frenchie burger. We were not disappointed. We usually skip dessert after such heavy main course, but we were so pleased that we ordered dessert with our coffee. Well done! Will definitely go back for more
4
The #1 thing I read to order from db Bistro was the foie gras burger. So that's what we did. we ordered a burger and a steak. The burger was good, but the steak was better. They did the right amount of done-ness, something which I only expect from Mortons and other steakhouses.The frites were good too. However, out of the 2 desserts we had (madelaines and profiteroles), I was slightly disappointed. I prefer Au Petit Salut's profiteroles to db Bistro's.On a side note, I had made the reservation for a special occasion and had requested for a nice/quiet table for two. When I arrived, they gave me a table in the middle of a row of 5. Not exactly my idea of nice. However, when I raised this with the receptionist, she offered to move me to the corner table of the same row, giving us some privacy. Although the sprinkling of empty tables (for 2) during my entire time there did distract from her efforts to be nice
5
Went to this restaurant for my dinner without reservation during the weekend, and it was very crowded. Were prepare to leave for another restaurant if they were to said no table available. But was surprise to hear that they were get a table for me.Waiters/waitresses were very attentive once you seated down. Menu were limited in choice, but then it is a celebrity restaurant, so maybe it wanted to make the dishes perfect.Wine per glass were pricy, but it is very good.Had a veal tenderloin and it was done perfect, and melt in your mouth, but the condiments used were on a salty side. Told the waiter on this when he asked how was the food, and were surprised that the chief put dessert + coffee on the house, free.Next trip to the restaurant, maybe will try the steak or the burger. But believe they will deliver good outcome.Good place for meat lover, and good place to dine if you expect good service
4
This DB bistro has an excellent service. I was ordering wagyu beef, original DB burger, salmon. I was expecting wowness on my foods but those were just some ordinary delicious foods. Dont expect too much because of the name
5
Excellent restaurant with good menu selection. We had the special salt crusted fish baked on the bone. Excellent meal
4
Went to DB with some family friends and really enjoyed the experience. The restaurant is located above the Casino in the shopping centre at the Marina Bay Sands. There are various celebrity restaurants and they were all full the night I visited so I would highly recommend making reservations.Very expansive menus catered equally well to both meat eaters and vegetarians. Service was smooth and not fussy with the waiters making an effort to make guests comfortable with the menu choices. There were 6 of us but the waiter suggested ordering 3 entree's to share among us as most of us went for larger main courses. Wine selection was good although none of us ordered any.The service staff were attentive and we never had to call to get our water glasses topped up. I found the prices very reasonable and apart from one hiccup where the waiter got the two steaks mixed up, it was a great night out
5
Daniel has created a number of great approaches to dining - and I am a big fan. So, when I found out that Stephane Istel - formerly of the Vancouver BC Bistro DB was running the kitchen, it was exciting - and I was sure we were in for a great meal. http://thechefsconnection.com/2010/06/10/stephane-istel/ - Chef is a delightful person with a light touch - the food starts great and gets better with enhancement - but never a heavy hand. My wife and I spent our 24th anniversary dinner with Chef Stephan and friends - and he truly produced a once-in-a-lifetime meal. It is now where I take business parties - as the early theatre meal - 5:30-7pm - Tue-Saturday is only 55+ or 65+ for three courses - a steal in hyper-expensive Singapore. Thanks folks for making a little bit of France in a perfect bistro style in Singapore. Merc

Wanted so much a positive experience but nothing to shout about would sum it up for me but the afternoon was pleasant enough. Except for the rather forgetful wait staff who needed reminding from water to menus to sugar.The food was good bistro fare. Portions not big but seemed just enough till an hour later you find yourself hungry againThe atmosphere was nice and bustling. Go again if I am in the area, not as a destination

well my wife and myself we are big fans of Daniel Boulud's restaurant since our stay in the US - he has done it right again - the quality in DB moderne at Marina Bay Sands is the same as everywhere - solid french bistro food in a nice french upscale bistro atmosphere. The dishes are classical but presented in a very nice way... Service is good - although it is as everywhere as in Singapore - sometimes a bit rushed, and it is difficult to find really good service personne

If you think that you can order a rustic, simple typical bistro meal at DB Bistro Moderne, well then -- you can't.This outpost of Daniel Boulud's restaurant empire brings more upscale offerings -- as befits where it's located, the very luxurious and premium mall at the Marina Bay Sands.However, the food was quite good -- we had the salmon and the tuna. We also enjoyed the cheese puffs that came as a complimentary appetizer. Warm bread was not as good as I would have wanted -- perhaps they don't make their own?I would have loved to try Boulud's famous foie gras enhanced burger but I have stopped eating meat so I can probably just try to imagine what it would taste.DB Bistro Moderne is set in a nice upmarket atmosphere -- softly lit, elegant furnishings and surroundings, well trained and efficient waitstaff.The prices are not unreasonable -- we enjoyed wine and beer with our meal and it did not amount to a lot. These are not bistro prices but can be classified in the moderate range

This is no bistro, of course... It's a French restaurant with a "bistro decor", which at first we thought might be a little too "stuck up" for our taste.What we experienced was quite the contrary. The staff were extremely friendly and were eager to make us feel at ease. The food was excellent, top cuisine quality. As a family, we had some quite diverse choices: one of my daughters had a hamburguer with fries, both excellent; my wife and I shared foie gras as a starter, among the best we've ever had in Paris; our main courses were also excellent, even the side salad was great. We had a "plain" 2005 bordeuax (overpriced, but excellent).Would love to go back several times and try everything on the menu: it's one of those places where you can't go wrong, whatever your choice

Here's the deal, we are English and live in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. For us an expensive meal out probably comes in at USD ($25). Of course while good, it is not comparable with the experience of eating at db Bistro Moderne.For one the surroundings, yes it's in what is effectively a Mall, sure a very nice Mall, in fact a stunning Mall, but nevertheless a Mall.But step in side and the ambiance and decor soon make you forget and the effect is of a cosy place.We had just been to see the Lion King and had not booked a table anywhere, We were celebrating our 22nd Anniversary and therefore wanted something special. But in the end we literally headed for one of the first places we found and asked if they were still serving, they were, they seated us and the experience began.The barely veiled window that shows the kitchen in action is a nice touch, it's not too intrusive but let's you see the calm and professional approach in the kitchen. There we plenty of other people eating around us and all seemed happy and were in no way being rushed.The staff were superb, very attentive and professional, We both had starters. I had the Assiete Lyonaisse and the Terrines were delightful, oh my sooo good.My wife had theTarte Fine' de Provincial which she enjoyed.She also had to drink Earl Gray Martini's a first for her and she was very impressed, she loves Earl Gray tea so she was very happy to discover this.For the main course I went for the Wagyu Bef Loin Strips which was absobloodylutely perfect, I mean perfectly cooked (I asked for and got medium rare) and not too much, more is not necessarily better, enough is sufficient. And meat of this quality so well cooked and presented was a real treat.My Wife had the Lamb Cous Cous and again was very pleased with her choice.For sweet, I made a bit of a mistake, I picked the Profiteroles Au Cafe', there was nothing wrong with them, beautifully presented but for my tastes just too bitter and overwhelmingly coffee.I was going to choose the Clafoutis Tout Chocolat, I don't know why I zigged instead of zagging.My wife choose the Ile Flottante, which she described as interesting and delightful.Oh and for those that care the toilets were also sparkling.This was a wonderful experience.The price excluding drinks per head was around USD $80 and frankly totally absolutely worth it

After seeing a review on my flight to Singapore I decided that I would love to try the DB gourmet burger. $38 later, I walked out hungry and disappointed at the terrible value for money offered by this restaurant. Luckily there is a food court nearby that serves great noodles as they were certainly a necessity after what amounted to be a good starter served by DB
