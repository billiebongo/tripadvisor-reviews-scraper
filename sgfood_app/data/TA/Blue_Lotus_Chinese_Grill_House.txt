Really good service- waiter got our order wrong but was rectified very quickly! He felt really bad about it and kept apologising. The food was amazing. A tad expensive but worth it.

Went during lunch hour and it was fully packed. Servicing of food is too slow though food is pretty good and service is fine.

Every dish was excellent.
Will definitely be back with more friends to try more great dishes!

Overall - the food is pretty good!
Great service! The Durian Cream brûlée is a must for dessert for Durian lovers!

Was expecting to be surprised by the description on the menu but was disappointed with the actual taste of the food. The presentation is fine but taste is nothing special or worth praising.

Not many places serve food cooked the traditionally way, with authentic traditional ingredients - pork lard! Food just taste different and more fragrant

This is a very new outlet from Blue Lotus Group. Claimed to be a Chinese Grill House but I find it was quite misleading as the food was not only Chinese but mixture of others as well. Food quality is average and the only one that I considered outstanding was Durian Burlee, which really had authentic and strong durian flavor. Service is considerably good

Great location near the Tanjong Pagar mrt. Enjoyed the outdoor seating. The food was a tad expensive for the portion size although delicious. Recommend the tapas for light eats and snacks. Very cool to have the stone pot mixed rice with truffle - fancy fried ric

Having dined at Blue Lotus at Quayside Isle, we arrived with great expectations. Housed on the ground floor of a mixed development block at Tanjong Pagar, parking on a Saturday afternoon was a breeze. We ordered the honey glazed kurobuta pork belly which was Blue Lotusâ€™s rendition of char siew for starters. It was amazingly good. Smoky, sweet and tender. For mains, we chose the Mapo Tofu and Stuffed Chilli Crab Claw. Both were excellent. Tofu was smooth and the sauce was just right. Not too numbing nor too spicy. The pomelo pulp adds a twist to the Chilli Crab Sauce. Overall a fantastic meal and we look forward to go back again.

After-work crowd was rowdy with drinking rounds. Food was average and expensive. Not child friendly (no baby chairs).

Good and service is excellent, must try will be their chicken skin, KL big noodles, fried bee hoon and not forgetting to try their crab meat balls.

Food was superlicious! You have to try it to know what I mean. Service was great - staff was friendly and always quick to attend to your needs

Love the food and people there. They also have nice offers and happy hours concept. Food is bit expensive for the quantity served.

Food tastes good and the presentation was fabulous. I especially liked the thinly-fried chicken skin as the sides, as well as the salted duck leg :).

Finally managed to find the time to visit with my wife and when we paid the bill and left, we had nothing but superlatives to say. The food is unique but tasty and the ambience, while a tad noisy, is comfortable. We had the Crab Balls in the signature Chilli Pomelo Sauce, Lobster Bisque with Hua Tiao Jiu and BBQ Prawns in Assam Butter Sauce. For dessert, we had the Durian Creme Brûlée which was to die for! One of the best desserts we have ever had, anywhere! In the words of the Terminator: I’ll Be Back!

Went for dinner with group of friends, decided to order a variety of dishes to share. Portion size was very small but the food was good. Modern-take on Chinese grill: char siew, steak. Good for a casual mid-week meal, but personally nothing to rave about. The air-con was also dripping directly onto me which was unpleasant.

I like what Blue Lotus Chinese Grill House is trying to do. In most dishes they've moved only tiny steps away from traditional recipes, but the kitchen is adding small flourishes and twists that are interesting. I wouldn't go as far as calling any of it "fusion"... it's more like "contemporary Chinese" or "modern Chinese".With experimentation comes some success and failure. The chicken skin with chilli yogurt dipper tapas didn't work for me, but the crab balls with chilli pomelo sauce was a clever play on traditional chilli crab tastes. In the main dishes, the pickled chilli Atlantic octopus with fermented tofu barley risotto was outstanding, but the 48-hour slow cooked Dong Po pork belly with mantou was disappointingly bland.I just like that they are trying things, and I would go back to try other items on the menu.On the plus side... if you're there in the evening, their all-night happy hour has a beer and house red and white wines at $8. On the minus side... they're a restaurant with the ugly "we don't serve free water" rule. There's a full bar, and on the night we were there the bartender was competent and keen to flex his skills.Service was friendly, and the staff introduced dishes where necessary. Effort has gone into the ambience, which (like the food) is contemporary Chinese

@TheKuoKnowsThe restaurant was packed to the rafters at lunch time. No surprises there. It’s in the Central Business District. But thank goodness for one or two spare tables outside.The set lunch at $18 was good value for money. A starter of Steamed Egg White with Shiitake Mushrooms was a great way to begin the meal. Silky smooth and lots of flavour.The Pork Chop and Rice on a hot plate was a sight for sore eyes. Beautifully presented. The chillie sauce on the side was quite superb. Plenty of kick.The cooling jelly was the perfect ending to a sumptious hassle-free meal. The a la carte menu looks a little on the pricey side. But could be worth trying, if the set lunch is anything to go by
