Real gd value lunch items there. Had the burger which was filling and probably better than what ud get at most other places at the same price

Best Sunday roast I’ve had in Singapore. Everything was spot on. Service, drinks, starters, mains. Good price too. Pork belly was to die for!
5
The service is excellent. From the starter to the main was nice. It is a pity they run out of their famous pudding the night we visit.

Only popped in for a lateish drink,but nice place,staff could have been Chirpier,but probably wanted to go home. 10.30 pm on a Tuesday night? Menu looked good. Will go at a busier time

Good food & Hendrick's gin !
Love the style and excellent services from the waitress and waiters ...

Pros: Nice location Kerb appealQuirky and cool venueAmazing gin selectionPretty friendly, smiley staffFun artwork/decor Quite speedy service Selection of food on menu Open kitchen style restaurant Many floors, each offering something different Clean and unique toilets Cons: Pricey for what you getVery salty meatCheap quality bacon/lardons with the burnt Brussel sprouts Limited selection of veggies
5
Very well executed dishes from its starters/sides to its mains and even desserts. Was pleasantly surprised at how each dish are done so perfectly! A place where they would make simple dishes into something unique. will definitely go back to try the other dishes! Has a very British vibe to it and really love their ambiance too

I went before Christmas and booked their set roast meal. It was poor experience.Firstly despite the booking they seemed surprised that we were there. The service (apart from one young lady on level 2) was slow and the staff were inept and had no knowledge.The waiter had to be hand held to take a simple order from a set menu. Their wine list is tiny but even then someselections were unavailable.The kitchen is open, as I have said before - open kitchens if you are good showcase your skills this merely aired their inadequacies in public.The starter was way too much and seemed like a meal in itself. I watched with growing dismay as I saw two Yorkshire puddings sit for 15 minutes on the service counter. During that time the kitchen staff behaved like the 3 Stooges constantly passing the same plates from one to another. The constant pinging of the microwave (sorry Combi oven) was intrusive.Then Yorkshire puddings were plated and were stone cold. I pointed this out and they took one away - not the other. I objected and a guy in outside clothes and wearing some Hawaiian style shirt got most upset. I was astounded to find out that this person was allegedly a manager. He seemed to take it as a personal affront that I pointed out they were cold and I didn't want them microwaving. He kept saying they use a Combi oven - microwave with a grill?The sprouts had at some point been very fresh, they were oily and cremated. The parsnips cooked (presumably in the Combi oven) were black and oily and and rubbery again a waste of good food. The roast potatoes were virtually uncooked. Recipe, par boil potatoes drain and dry off shake and then roast, not really a difficult recipe.To her credit the young lady on level 2 waived off the food costs. The Hawaiian shirted Combi oven aficionado disappeared without trace.All in all pretty poor. the rustic decoration by the way is badly done and just looks tatty. If this were a gastropub in the UK it would have gone out of business long ago

In a city with hundreds perhaps thousands of good to great restaurants and bars this one is right at the top for a big night out from the best gins in town on the roof to the elite dining spaces in between and the great ground level bar, every need covere

It's OK. Different vibes on different floors. Downstairs bar isn't very cosy or comfortable, with mostly stools and harsh decor. Upper floors better. Definitely doesn't have any British vibes to it. Beer tasted slightly watered down as well. Better places in the neighborhood to go to. On the plus side, the staff were friendly and accommodating
4
Very cosy and chill restaurant ! The food was good and for the price is really damn worth it ! Will visit again !
5
Epic gastro pub in central singapore, great beers on tap, stunning pub food, the roast is the best I've had in yrs
4
The service is good. Staff are attentive. Food is not bad but a little pricey.
Overall a good experience for people who wants a place to have dinner and chill out.
5
Good place for after work drinks with colleagues, especially on a friday. Pina colada on tap is to die for!
3
Have been several times, and really enjoyed it, so took mum who was visiting a few weeks ago. The food was cold, the parsnips we had to reject as they were old and stringy and the gravy was instant packet in flavour at best. The meat was good as always but also cold. On the plus side, the environment is great, the vibe is relaxed and the beer is good. Maybe a one-off as we have had a good experience on previous visits, though the most recent experience puts me off any future daliance. PS ....... cold Yorkshire puddings is just lazy :
4
Have just come back from having a lovely Sunday roast dinner here, we had the roast beef and the turkey for the main course, it really is very good food and the service was excellent.The only down side was it was my wives birthday and I had requested a birthday cake / dessert ... I had called to see if this was possible and was told that they don’t have a birthday cake but would sort out a birthday dessert, this never came.But we still had an enjoyable lunch
5
We went to Oxwell to celebrate father and son's birthday. I read of some complaints of the service level but we really have nothing but good things to say about the service. We first sat in one corner but my daughter had wanted to sit on the cushioned bench so we ask to shift and they gladly let us. After we switched place, we realized the new place is drafty, as it is right under the air-conditioning. But we decided to stay. But the waiter must have heard our whispers about being cold and the next thing we know, he took the initiative to turn the air-conditioning up for us. It was very nice and observant of him. The food is great. The squid and the wings were great! We all enjoyed our mains as well; the beef steak, the fish and the burger. All thumbs up. Finally, the restaurant kindly provided complimentary desserts for us to celebrate the birthdays with. It was a great night at Oxwell & Co.
5
Went during lunch and had the whole place to ourselves! Without a doubt, the service wasn't great as the servers were very attentive and were smiling each time they attended to us which really brightens up customers' day! We ordered the liver pate which was served in a little glass jar and it was so good! The bread was well toasted and it's so yummy we ordered a second serving. Loved the pickled veg as well! For mains, we ordered the herb roasted sea bass and it's very fresh! The salad at e side consists of freshly sliced asparagus and seasoning. The reason why we knew it's freshly sliced was because I sat facing the chef at work and watched them work on our dishes. Afte our meal, the chirpy waitress again brightened our day by wishing us a great day! Really love the food and service and we will definitely return
4
Was in the neighbourhood for dinner, but the place wasn't open yet, so we decided to pop in and have a few drinks. Happy hour pina coladas were just $10, and came with a interesting twist of coconut meringue. Can not evaluate the food as we did not eat here, but would go again for the booz
5
We stumbled on this bar/restaurant whilst out in the area and decided that it was a great, if cliched, place for an English couple to celebrate a year of living in Singapore. The roast beef lunch was delicious, with all if the trimmings. The staff were friendly and the house Malbec was good enough. So a thumbs up for Oxwell &Co
2
High prices for drinks and average food. We drank Apferol Spritz, but it was a small glass of ice and probably only small amounts of Apferol and Prosecco at a price of 20 dollars. You will find better place in the same area.
4
We didn't try the food but it's a good watering hole for those who want a little bit of an English atmosphere, good service and drinks to end the day.
4
Great vibes, no wonder this place is always packed to the brim on a Friday night! Highly recommend the cocktails they have on tap, esp the pina colada and gin tonic :)
2
The place itself is nice and tucked in a nice little street with some other bars and restaurants. The issue for me was the price of the drinks, namely the beer. I had 8 beers which came to $141.25 including tax and service charge. Bearing in mind the beers aren't even pints, I seen my 8 beers as 4 pints which cost nearly Â£90.The night before I went to a really cool roof top bar with an amazing view over the city. They make their own craft beers and you can buy a pint there, with an incredible view, for $17. Therefore I can't help but feel Oxwell & Co is incredibly expensive
4
There were 7 of us for lunch and we were the only ones there for the most part which was good - for us! The menu is smaller for lunch but there were enough items to satisfy all diners. The fried calamari had just the perfect crunch with the spicy squid ink dip and was AWESOME. The chicken liver pate was also very good and a generous portion. Most of us had the burgers which lacked the beefy flavour but was juicy and came with a load of fries. The Fish (seabass) & Chips and Leek & Potato soup went down well with the others. We order one of each of the two desserts - a toffee cake with salted-caramel sauce and a lemon mousse with shortbread. Both were great though the lemon mousse was really very satisfying.Service was good and must add that the young girl server who was looking after our table, took the initiative to serve the toffee cake with a "Happy Birthday" - in sauce :-) - when she overheard that the get together was a birthday celebration. Impressive!We will be back - for dinner this time
5
Once again, I have lucked on a place that serves gin, my favourite tipple. And this was gin in abundance. We enjoyed the rooftop bar late in the evening, tucking by the ladleful into a bathtub of gin - a small claws foot bathtub of gin and tonic with rosemary. For four to share this was Sg70. The bar was not crowded on a Monday night. Well worth the trek up three flights of stairs
5
Highly recommend this place for anyone who's looking to satisfy their fish & chips cravings! Their roast pork mains were also a highlight. As for sides, Pork scratchings are a must try. parents with young children who's looking for a toddler or child friendly place to go - keep this in your list because they have kids menu and colouring materials!
4
Though only dropped in here for a cold frothie(beer), I thought the overall presence of the bar was great, decor and furniture were very good!! The service was a bit underwhelming, but this may have been because of the time of day, middle of the afternoon.Though not my cup of tea, they had a great list of Gin, which would know doubt keep most people happy. I would definitely visit again, to have a look at the balcony bar
2
We actually went there in the evening after passing by while strolling in the afternoon. Amazing place from the outside: with the cock fightings posters on the walls and the copper tubings, seems like it'only missing a cowboy pacing outside. However... Chef Sargeant is supposed to be a pupil of Ramsay, but the food is completely not adequate. I expected at least to be asked how I want my burger cooked. Or found in the menu all the ingredienti of a salad, not get the surprise of finding blue cheese. The cocktails are overpriced and...good... Nothing memorabile
2
I was here only for a late-hour cocktail, so I cannot judge the food quality.The place is nice, and the rooftop is small (and not very high) but nice.The cocktail was very-average... given the area (full of top-quality bars) this is not one of my favourites 
4
Roast beef was excellent. Needs a veg other than spud on dish otherwise very good. Not cheap tho. Starter main and 2 drinks 110 sgd
4
A warm welcome and a proper British roast beef lunch with all the trimmings and it didn't disappoint, it was delicious, the beef just melting in the mouth. We shall return.
4
Heading back to my hotel so stopped in for a beer. Booked a table for Sunday Lunch! Looks like a great spot for excellent ales. Friendly staff helps
4
$180 for 800g of beef could be share for four to five adult. Not bad compare to each order a beef roast
5
The rooftop bar here, after dark is a Singapore gem. The food is excellent and creative. Some very creative drinks oin the various bars too.
2
Usually I like the food at Oxwell. However, recently when I went for Sunday lunch with some friends, there were a few issues: 1. the food was not hot when served, 2. the roast potatoes tasted like they had been cooked hours before 3. my friend had rare meat when she asked for medium. We had to send the food back a couple of times and we'd been in the restaurant close to an hour by the time we could actually eat. I sent a complaint to the restaurant afterwards and no-one bothered to respond
3
A warm greeting met us upon arrival. Service was a bit slow and we had to prompt for our orders to be taken. We ordered Sunday roast. The chicken was mostly bone and little meat, the beef was tough (and certainly didn't resemble a traditional roast) although there was plenty of meat. The roast potatoes were horrid, warmed up roasties so had gone soggy and nasty. The side dishes to accompany the roast were odd, the only normal option were carrots or brussel sprouts (which most people hate) so that left us with a choice of carrots, tomato salad and, I think, one other option.Very disappointed and wouldn't come back for Sunday lunch, We have eaten here for other meals too and had a far better experience. Definitely the advice is eat here except at lunchtimes on Sunday
5
I been there with two friends we decided to grab some drinks in rooftop bar in oxwell and co. It was a sunday and not all bars open in that time we were greeted with a very friendly bartender (Cyrene) and had a chat with her. she recommended thyme for breakfast cocktail which was really superb Sure we will come back.
5
We went past here on our Chinatown walking tour and thought we’d be back for a few well-earned drinks once we finished up and we did go back.It’s got a really quirky feel to it and absolutely loved the taps on the wall, especially the Gin and Chronic.There is inside, upstairs and outside which we chose so that we could watch the world go by.When we go to Singapore well have to check it out again and try the food as well
5
Came here for my birthday recently for a late lunch on a Saturday and it was quiet upstairs in the restaurant. Food was excellent - we had the steak frites (chef willingly changed the fries for a salad) and their burger - with both done very nicely. Drinks were equally good - various drinks on tap and I don't just mean beer. They definitely stay out from the crowd in terms of their drinks. Thumbs up
5
Wouls definitely come back again, esp for that pork belly main course that is at a low price too!!!!
5
Nice and relax place for a drink. The decoration is wonderful. I had a Pina Colada, it coated with a coconut mixed with marshmallow on top. They used a fire gun to roast it. It's very nice and the drink tasted very good.
4
Excellent and friendly service staffs with great food quality especially the onion rings. Will be back again.
2
Turned up for Sunday lunch on a friend's recommendation, but the long wait for drinks to appear did not auger well. Food quality, when it arrived, was OK, but portions were small. We'd asked for separate bills, but this was a serious challenge for our waitress, who, nevertheless persevered and, eventually succeeded. The prices, even for Singapore, were high, with 10% service charge plus HST on top of that. Not my worst experience by far, but there are many more cheaper, better places out there to eat which are more deserving of punters' business.
2
Went here to try out their sunday roast.Food wasnt out of this world..it wasnt great. Beef was all right.. above averageThe half chicken was more like a quarter chicken.. and kinda burnt.The yorkies were good though!Had a toffee beer which was good.Overall ambience was nice , service was good but frankly there are better places out there with better foo
5
Desperate for a good Sunday roast, Oxwell and Co were recommended. They didn't disappoint. Wagyu beef was cooked perfectly. Seeing as it was Mother's Day, the potatoes and Yorkshires were made in abundance and in advance. They were still nice, but the potatoes did lose a bit of their crunchiness. The Yorkshires didn't though. The potatoes are such a small criticism and shouldn't deter from the reader going there. I for sure will be going back again to try the pork belly! I really appreciated the complimentary glass of bubbles and pudding. Eat there, you won't regret it
5
Went for Sunday Roast with my wife, son and his friend on the recommendation of another friend. The Wagyu roast beef was excellent as were the vegetables and Yorkshire puddings that went with it. The meal was not "heavy" as some roasts can be. Service and friendliness of the staff was excellen
5
I took my husband and two very good friends to Oxwell & Co for his birthday today. The surprise was how amazing the service and food was and how welcome we were made to feel. The boys both had the roast and I had a burger and our other friend had the salad. All food was amazing but the yorkies were the best I have ever had. Thank you all so much for the best end to our day we could have imagined. Everyone get yourselves down there and see how you should be spending your Sundays!
1
I went to this place to see its rooftop bar... well is a micro terrasse and i noticed it was full only after climbing the 3 floors of stairs, nobody at the entrance to regulate the access.Anyhow I decided to take a cocktail at the ground floor... it was basically a small glass full of ice with a very small no-taste liquid inside; for 24 dollars i would have expected more. The other bars just beside are not cheaper but much much better for quality, quantity and service..

Went for Sunday Roast with friends from out of town. Oxwell & Co is spread over 3 floors. Bar/Lounge on 1st Floor (Ground); Dining Room on 2nd Floor and Rooftop bar and is located in the busy Club Street area.We booked Sunday Roast in the Dining Room. I immediately loved the decor, reminding me of a high end British Gastropub.As soon as you walk into the dining room, you can see the mountain of large, crispy yorkshire puddings, hence you know you are in for a treat.We all ordered the roast beef. The beef was succulent, roasties were very tasty, you are given an abundance of gravy to poor yourself. The only thing missing was another vegetable of some sort (carrots, beans or broccoli would have been great), but for extra, you can order their veg of the day.The Gin menu is fantastic and the garnishes and tonics that are matched with each Gin, make the experience very special.The staff were very attentive and any additional asks and recommendations needed were met with swift service. The table ordered a lot of extra roasties and yorkshire puddings, so we kept the staff busy
4
Very nice Roast dinner, The Yorkshire puddings we delicious as were the roast potatoes.
Starts were easy and tasty but the main event of the roast dinners was what I had been missing from the UK the most.
5
Had our D&D at this restaurant recently. Well decorated place with nice paintings. The decor was nice. Service was attentive. As for the food, presentation was pretty but most dish are salty.
4
Great service with a Stella atmosphere. I didn't visit the roof garden but even street level was nice. Definitely recommend the gin and chronic.
5
The food was really delicious, well presented, portions generous, service staff friendly and helpful- we all enjoyed ourselves.
4
Great to visit again - we came for the Xmas Dinner as advertised. I was a little disappointed that the dishes didn't match up to what was shared in the advertisement otherwise happy with all.
1
Had organic turkey. Food was disappointing. Doesn't taste like english weekend roast at all. Wanted to order beef but the meat they used was beef fillet. overall not recommended
4
if you are looking for a great place for lunch on a Sunday look no further than Oxwell and Co. Great food and some exceptional cocktails - sit outside and enjoy your afternoon. The service is friendly and its a great spot for a meal. I will be back. Enjoy
5
Went here in a party of six a couple of Sundays ago. We began with delicious bloody marys as we studied the menu, accompanied by yummy battered and deep fried corn! You can order your own individual meal, on this occasion the choices were turkey, pork belly, fish and roast beef. We opted for sharing platters which contained all of the meats and these were just perfect. We had sides of sprouts with bacon, honeyed parsnips and carrots. Everyone was served a portion of crunchy roast potatoes and enormous Yorkshire puddings. The sticky toffee pudding, however, was a little dry and not great. The mains? Superb. Warning......it gets hot upstairs but then again it was a particularly hot day
4
Had the Mixed Meat platter and then each of the side veg. Sprouts, Carrots and Parsnips, everything was good, the beef was lovely and the pork a bit fatty for my liking but nice Salty Crackling. My only complaint would be the price we had 6 beers but $280 for 2 without starters or deserts I would say a touch expensive.Saying that if you need a Roast it ticks the boxes
4
There are times as a European expat when the delights of Chilli crab and hainese chicken rice fade and all you crave is heavy carbs awash with gravy and all the roast meat you can handle - in moments like these, Oxwell & Co holds your hand and guides you through the tough times! Cosy set up, nice decor, great food and friendly staff - happy dayz
1
Everything is said in the headline. Waitress simply didn't talk or answered the questions (nodding for them), wine is overpriced, beer is extremely overpriced.
Never ever
But thanks for free wifi........ it gives "0,5" of the "1" star
4
Great atmosphere and good food. veggies cooked to perfection but could do with more meat on the sharing platter.
4
Dined for lunch with colleagues
Small but good menu
Service polite and efficient
Excellent pulled pork roll with superb triple fried chips.
Very quiet but in a great area of Singapore
Burger not as good as Club Street Social
3
dropped by for drinks recently. it's a nice location, just by the corner of club street and ann siang. lovely to just have a drink or two and people watch. good service as well. will come back and try the roof top bar / restaurant.
5
Perfect dinner, great atmosphere, perfect service. Nothing more to say. We had a great evening and will come back soon
5
Sunday Roast was excellent. By far the best Sunday Roast we have had in Singapore. Highly recommend.
4
This is certainly a lively bar in a very pleasant area which is shut off to traffic at the weekend, they have a great assortment of beers and food but I would agree that it's a bit pricy but a good alternative to the chaos of Clark quay with the mix of bars with their rooftop bars
4
On the 3rd floor you can squeeze onto the roof top bar and drink the best spiced rum mojito I have ever had. Maybe it's because in this heat they hit the spot I am unsure but they were good and went down well! The bar is I believe in all floors and was very busy but worth the walk to the top to enjoy the evening.Very quirky, funky place to go
3
Just had my birthday dinner here with some friends (about 10 of us). I booked for dinner in the dining room on the second floor. I was slightly disappointed to find out then that they had changed to the holiday menu (Starting Nov 1st which in itself is insanely early imho) and did not offer the menu advertised on their website.You would think they would tell me this when I made the reservation (online and later had called again to ask for additional seats) The menu was more traditional holiday items, but an average of $10 more for everything. The food turned out to be pretty good, and more filling than it looked (I had smoked salmon salad for appetizers, the steak and brussels sprouts for main). I, and the majority of my friends were pleased (would have been more pleased with a slightly lower price tag). It only struck me as odd that all the main courses didn't arrive at the same time and there was some awkward waiting at one end of the table. Being a table of 10, we will close an eye for this ;)Ambiance wise was great. The table set up, bright, cheery interior, plenty of space. The service was fantastic (Especially the male manager - sorry I forgot his name). He was so attentive, gracious, and polite, seeing to our every need. After dinner, we went to the rooftop bar, which was slightly disappointing. They had their own menu so we weren't able to order beers from downstairs. It was also terribly warm, noisy, and crowded. I actually think they should look into a max capacity up there. I think if you're looking for after dinner drinks, I would suggest downstairs or down the street. All in all it was a good evening and i would recommend eating and drinking here on a splurgy occasion
1
I visited Oxwell about a month ago with my wife and another couple in our once-a-month search to discover a good Sunday roast (which is surprisingly difficult to find in Singapore). Having booked this 2 weeks in advance by phone and discussing with the person how we were looking forward to Sunday roast as Oxwell came highly recommended, I asked what would be the best time to come as a foursome and promptly booked. On arrival, we were seated at a nice table and then told that only the large prime rib was left (not a good start) which was quoted to me in cost per grams. On quickly doing the maths that meant over 140 dollars for the meat alone (no wonder they quote in cost per grams!)Expressing my disappointment they then discussed in the kitchen did offer to cut me a smaller one - but it's grilled anyway so it's hardly a roast!Ordering a steak (*sigh*) I then ordered house wine only to discover the vintage was an inferior one to that advertised on the menu (I checked this, they didn't offer this information freely) - and then the same thing with the next bottle of wine we ordered! Inferior vintages are fine but don't advertise (and charge more) for better vintages - Very Cheeky!My wife's steak was then brought rare not blue after we explained several times she wanted blue. Basically this was a disaster as agreed by all four of us - and this meal was far from cheap.Pros - nice carrots, extra gravy when requested, pleasant decorCons - Staff rather inattentive/untrained, cheeky misleading menus (both for food, and for drink), not a real roast as the meat was cooked on the grill, VERY pricey for very mediocre food.In summary, avoid the Sunday lunch at all costs (in fact, I would highly recommend the Saturday lunch and free flow at Club Meatballs instead). If you do go, go early so they don't run out and try to charge over 100 bucks for a grilled prime rib.Don't say you weren't warned..
3
Short menu but great value for the ladies dining society on a Wednesday (ladies night) with three courses plus champagne on arrival and a cocktail with dessert for $50. Main courses were the weaker link and nothing special but starters and desserts were decent.
4
Really enjoyed the street view patio of Oxwell & Co. They have great design. I loved the NZ white wine they had. Hated the bill!
3
I have been there for happy hour drinks in the past, which has been relatively ok. Recently I attended a friend's birthday dinner there. We had an entire room on the top floor booked out for the event. Ambiance was nice. Cosy and nicely decorated. We had two staff waiting exclusively for us, and service was good. Food was slow to come out though. For entree I had the tiger prawns - they were amazing. Good portion and big prawns. Had smocked bacon in it too. Really nice. For main I had the braised shoulder of lamb. Was a little disappointed by it though. Portion was small for a main, taste was average, and I didn't think it was worth the $38. One of my friends had the onglet steak which looked good. Overall it was a good evening with relatively good service, however I felt the food was a bit overpriced
1
We came here for a late lunch on National Day. We picked a table in the sun on a really beautiful day. The waiter asked us if we wanted the blind closed - we said we didn't as we wanted to be in the sun.We ordered drinks and food. 5 minutes later some others arrived and occupied the table next to ours. The waiter lowered the blind at their request blocking the sun for us. We complained and claimed "squatters rights" in that being there first the blind should remain open - there were also other tables inside and out the others could have sat at out of the sun. The waiter did nothing except tried to make us agree to have the blind down.In an attempt to enjoy our lunch and avoid further confrontation we moved - however the new table was unsatisfactory as too narrow and there was a wobbly stool.So we left - the manager did offer us gratis drinks which was decent. He did try and we recognise that. However we went elsewhere as they clearly viewed us as being second class customers. We felt really unwelcome in that place. This is a shame as it's been a regular venue for me and my wife and friends - indeed they hosted my 49th birthday. And being close to the CBD I've had plenty of business meetings there too.The Oxwell attitude is suboptimal on various levels:1. The saw us as 2nd class - perhaps they should publish a preferred customer type as we would have known and not wasted our time.2. They don't care about loyalty - I estimate I've been there 15 - 20 times with one big event. Perhaps they can publish the number of visits you need to make to be considered loyal as my loyalty is clearly insufficient.So - I can no longer recommend the place. I suggest you do some due diligence before you go to ensure you are the type of people they want as customers otherwise you may be very disappointed

We so happen come accross this sign saying something like "singapore best roof top bar and worth the 4 flight of stairs..." so we were curious and we head straight up. The rooftop looks like a herb garden and it doesn't really look like a bar but it was cozy and windy. We arrived early as when we reached nobody was there not even the bar tender. When he came we were impressed as he served 2 glasses of water without asking (maybe he knew we were gasping for air after climbing the 4 flight of stairs) but to our horror the mason jar was filthy we kept our mouth shut didn't drink the water and just proceed to order our drinks instead but after 1 bottle each we decided to leave. On the bright side the 1 person manning the bar was nice. After all this isn't the best roof top bar
5
Had immediate seating outside. Service was speedy and attentive. It's a great location to people watch as well as to spend quality time with your friends. The Gin and Chronics are great and was our drink of choice for the night. Definitely will hit up this location whenever we're in town
3
Went here a few times while in Singapore.Great location at the top of Club St, was really busy on our first visit and had great atmosphere. Unfortunately one of our drinks got overlooked and we had to ask the waiter to chase it up after everybody else had received their drinks. Second round included a couple of beers and they weren't great, tasted like lines needed to be cleaned or just slightly off.Went back to try the roof bar and this was a good spot if you can grab a table (very small), drink selection is limited upstairs but a good spot
5
We had a brilliant night here with awesome food, drinks and service. Loved the building architecture and its quirky interior, and the rooftop bar with its herb-filled planter boxes was perfect for after dinner drinks. The chicken with peppercorn sauce was the highlight along with the roasted sprouts with lardons but we all loved our dishes (quail, slow cooked lamb, grouper...). Even the roasted carrots got rave reviews! They use the herbs from the rooftop in their cooking and even to garnish their drinks.Definitely worth a visit. Would love to go again..
4
Great ladies night package. Food was beautifully presented and tasty, and the complete package of appetizer, mains, desserts and drinks meant a fuss-free, relaxing night out. The food plating was especially commendable given the fact its a ladies night promotion and not ala carte. Also, the mains and desserts were of great quality
4
We booked our seats in advance and I had made a note that we would have a toddler and a baby in a pram. Upon arrival we were told that we were upstairs on the 3rd floor which meant a lot of steps with a pram! Our son wasn't given a high chair but he is big enough to go on a normal chair so this wasn't a huge problem but something to take note of if you are bringing little ones. We were seated in The Study which is one large table that seats 12+ (Usually used for parties/events but it was Father's Day so they opened it up) and another 2 families were also seated there too. The room is not pleasant acoustically with small screaming / crying children! Both myself and my husband had quite a headache by the time we left but this was unfortunate as obviously you can't plan who else is going to be there! The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the beef and the roast chicken with a side of carrots. The portions were generous and we both commented on how much meat they serve! Yorkshire pudding was delicious and nice big crispy roast potatoes. Sadly we had to wait quite long (50+ mins) as the kitchen was busy being Father's Day. Our waitress was extremely attentive and apologised for the delay. If not for the sound and the delay this would have been 10/10! We will definitely be going back and asking for a table on the 2nd floor!

Great venue for a drink, I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat.
The beer was good, cocktails looked great and the décor was much different to norm in Singapore.
Club Street itself is old school and well worth a visit.
4
Just here for a few drinks, very pleasant sitting on the veranda. Didn't eat but menu of snacks looks tempting. Great decoration and a bit of calm beyond Chinatown

- Byritish-style gastropub consisting of a bar, restaurant seating upstars and a private dining area.
- serves G&T on tap
- homegrown greens at its roof garden
- average service
- has ongoing weekly promotions for G&T, fish and chips, and Sunday roast
2
We took 1 hour waiting for our food. They never apologizes with us. Food also not that good. Environment still ok.
5
We enjoyed an exceptional lunch here. I really enjoyed the Pimms and my husband had a great gin and tonic. The smoked haddock was brilliant and I know it's strange to rave about Brussel sprouts but the sprouts with lardons were to fab, I would go back just for them
5
We had a very enjoyable roast lunch. I had the beef and my husband had the lamb, The roast came with Yorkshire pudding, duck fat potatoes and Gravy. We also got a side of the brussels sprouts as well as the the pear and stilton salad. Everything was very yummy and filling. The gravy was plentiful and had a slight asian slant / taste.I particularly enjoyed the alcoholic drinks. I highly recommend the "Gin & Chronic" which they have on tap, and the Pina Colada
5
Did not eat at Oxwell but did enjoy a few sharpeners at this quirky bar. Beer was cold and arrived swiftly and the immediate pour pre mix cocktails were a nice touch and the pina colada went down pretty well too. Club street as a general destination has a great atmosphere and gives you an idea of the sort of buildings usual to Singapore before the erection of giant sky scrapers. It also has a preservation order on the street so its good to know that Club Street will remain as it is
4
Very quirky interior when you get to the upper levels. Rooftop is nice as not very many in the area (more chilled than Screening Rooms) The 'bath' of Hendricks G&T was nice for sharing, not huge selection of drinks or cocktails as some places and service was very slow. We ordered some food was slightly above average, the fish burger and prawns was nice, also pork scratchings interesting. I will come back here mainly for the view, and decent choice in indie/retro music and quirkiness of decor and the frersh herbs used in the cocktails
5
The bottom level is like a bar which looks nice for drinks but the second & third floor is for dinner - the music be it from the bar opposite or downstairs is so loud and we can hear it during the dinner. This was the only downside. Food was excellent though. starters like watercress soup and smoked haddock for starters was great. Venus clams was light and different with shaved celery. Tiger prawns and lentils again was different. Ribeye was a bit salty but good beef. All in all we really enjoyed the food. Service was excellent! On the ball and receptive to our needs. Tis place is highly recommended - but probably not suitable for a romantic evening
4
Found my favourite bar on the hill had morphed and was looking for a replacement and stumbled on Oxwell & Co. Was there on a weekday evening so not too crowded (can get a bit manic at the weekend and would tend to avoid then). Tried the "on tap" pina colada cocktail and ended up having several. The gin & chronic, negroni and old fashioned were also quite good according to friends. Some nice bar snacks and if you are pining for some non-Asian gastropub-style food then the dining room menu looks just the ticket. Friendly staff and good service. Will go back when next passing through
4
All-in-one venue. Casual drinks and bar bites at L1, dining at L2, Private dining room at L3, Rooftop bar for drinks. Service is excellent and portions are quite big so you might consider ordering to share, especially the mains.
4
The infused Gin and Tonics are something to be revered, and the setting could not be better. Choose an outdoor table to get the full experience!
4
Came here for brunch. One of the few places open around the hood/ street. Good service, good food. Nice outdoor sitting place.
3
had dinner with some friends, some dishes were great (squid) but others (Burger) were extremely over salted/spiced. Ify experience given you're paying 25+ for dishes.
4
Great spot. Very atmospheric with exposed pipes, vices, steel and wood. Very industrial. Mood lit with dozens of Edison globes hanging from the ceiling. Worth a visit, if not for a meal, for a drink stop
5
Excellent food! I have heard many great reviews about this place and decided to check it out for myself, taking one of my team for a Christmas Lunch. The food was plentiful, presented professionally and tasted absolutely gorgeous! Excellent service and friendly staff. A definite recommendation and I will be going back
4
Prime location on the corner on the corner of Ann Siang Hill and Club St makes this a great spot for people watching and a convenient meeting point for pre-dinner drinks. Beer selection is good although limited. Oxwell has the unique concept of keeping three cocktails on tap if you really want to throw caution to the wind. Bar snacks range in quality but the fried calamari was excellent and we ordered two rounds when there. Happy hour 4pm to 8pm
3
I've visited many times ... for lunch when most of the food on the menu isn't available to Friday night where it's super lively and fun to get drunk on their Pina Colada or other cocktails.So yes it is hit and miss. The first ever lunch the food was all there and it was great, tasty scotch eggs and meat but then most of the menu isn't there ... seems ridiculous but then again it is Singapore.It's pricey too considering the portions and more recently the quality has been slacked
4
Had lunch here, had a great time. The food is excellent (try the ceviche) decent sized portions, the fish & chips was huge. I had the pork belly which was delicious. Charming staff, prompt service though I no way pushy. Very relaxing and pleasant environment. Highly recommend
5
This place is excellent. The food and drinks are of a real high quality. We had a business lunch in the private dining room. It was a superb space with really great deco. I highly recommend this place. Also, Serena the manager was so helpful and accommodating
2
Nice ambience but limited selection of food.
Everything seems over-priced.
Expect better food quality and service for the price we paid (S$150+ for 2).
Will not be back again.
4
Popped in for a nice and fresh beer in a steamy hot early afternoon of January. Place was quiet and we has a chance to fully enjoy the good vibe. Staff very friendly and the ambience has a very cool industrial fit out.
Very pleasant.
2
Food was pretty decent but was expecting higher quality and taste. Good ambience and vibe. Service is poor, can't get much of their attention or maybe they are just overwhelmed.
2
We booked a table with friends on a Friday night. The building looks amazing inside and out. The service was good but the food was a real let down. Very small portions and for the price that you pay for a main course we had far higher expectations about the food. The tables next to us ordered burgers which looked a lot better than the beef cheek that I had.
3
Was there for a second time for dinner and drinks with some friends. The first time I went was for drinks at the first floor. This time was for dinner. The menu is very limited and service was kind of fake and with service staff trying to "push" us to buying more wines. Food was average. Nothing to rant about. Will take a while before I will want to visit them again
3
Oxwell is one of the best restaurants. There was a guy who worked there who was great. Remembered my name and knew the menu. Rare to find good service like that in Singapore. But service is slipping. We ordered oysters then steak and after almost an hour they both came at once. And they forgot a side order. And the cutlery. The downstairs servers didn't seem to get what to do and weren't aware of the small things like clear the plates when they are done. It's the small things that matter and they are easy. Pay attention guys you used to be great at this.
2
Not a very good restaurant. Limited menu, far too expensive for what it is and average service. The olives are worth a special mention for being the most unpleasant tasting things i have ever tried. We were asked to leave at 10pm because they wanted to shut, not before having to sit through half an hour of watching the kitchen staff shut up and clean. Wont be going back and wouldn't recommend this place
5
We enjoyed a delicious roast dinner upstairs at Oxwell & Co. I had the beef striploin, while my partner enjoyed the pork belly. Both came with perfectly done roast potatoes, yorkshire puddings, gravy and veg. The decor is stylish in a gastropub style, staff were friendly and we left well fed and very happy
5
This was our 5th visit to the "Dining Room" restaurant upstairs (we have been many more times to the bar downstairs). Every time that we have eaten here over the last 6 months it has been an enjoyable experience.Easy to book online via the website means that there is no confusion as to when you will be eating and you can choose your time. Your reservation is then confirmed on the day and they double check any dietary requirements (not many restaurants do this in Singapore). Tip: Arrive slightly early and enjoy the atmosphere on the ground floor bar and the home made G&T on tap!After your pre dinner drinks, proceed upstairs to the small dinning room which can seat approximately 40 people. Once again, this is decorated in an eclectic style. The restaurant manager (Irene?) is very good and very helpful. The other staff are very pleasant however could do with a little more training to be at a restaurant of this caliber.Food menu is small with about 5 or so items in each course. The wine menu is full of more boutique wines from around the world, once again, a small selection (maybe 15 or so in each category).Food is excellent and the chef does take into account/make recommendations for any dietary requirement. It is simple uncomplicated food with great flavours cooked well. Because of this we keep coming back. Highly recommend coming and eating in the Dining Room
4
Was here last night for a small Pre-Christmas dinner. The bar below was a great buzz with the restaurant upstairs, much quieter. It was quite small, but spacious without having to hear other conversations at other tables. Service was great, attentive but not obtrusive. The meal started with the fresh bread which was served warm. We ordered the Christmas feast menu and the turkey was perfectly cooked. We all agreed it was the first time we all really enjoyed our brussel sprouts which were cooked really nicely with lardons which kept us going for more. The starters I had the steak tartare which I thought came as a fairly generous portion, flavors were very well balanced and came with very nice toasted bread although a bit burnt. The desserts were a great treat to end of the meal, but didn't leave a lasting impression for me. I see they do Sunday Roasts which I'm very keen to return to try soon.
5
I dined here during the week. They have a new manager and chef in place and it shows!
Had a great experience with service and food
Will be back soon
4
I have been here for a few quiet, low key business lunches. It's pretty quiet so you can hear each other. The setting is well styled but not pretentious and the food is very good and reasonably priced.

Oxwell is located close to the intersection of Ann Siang Hill and Club Street.The kitchen is now helmed by two young chefs, Nicholas and Rishi, who have both done stints at different avant garde restaurants, such as Tetsuya in Australia.We came by to try their Christmas menu, which has some specially-created ala carte items for the season: Starters:- Blue Swimmer Crab with Watercress and shaved Jamon ham: Fresh de-shelled crab meat mixed with finely cut apple, onions with a dressing of watercress and topped with Jamon ham shavings. I liked the freshness of the crab with the watercress dressing.- Steak Tartare with Oyster Cream, Sorrel and Fresh Horseradish: This was my favorite dish of the meal. You must put away your usual notion of steak tartare. At first glance, the meat looks like cut tuna, and when we tasted it, we thought it tasted like tuna, because of the horseradish (alike wasabi). However this was clarified that it was beef! Instead of finely chopped beef, you get beef cut into 0.5 cm by 0.5cm, together with cut oysters. The oyster cream was da bomb. It was freshly made inhouse, with cooked oyster and squid ink! I couldn’t get enough of the sauce. If it can be bottled, I will bring it home. Must try!- Blue Foot Mushroom, with Crème Fraiche, Cep, Mushroom Broth and Thyme: The dish had crème fraiche as the base, then topped with 2 types of brown and white mushrooms and cep (looks like brown earth, which has a nutty earthy flavour). The mushroom broth was then added on the side and topped with thyme. The chef also included popped unpolished rice (ala pop corn) in the dish. Overall an interesting dish!- Beef Rossini - Tenderloin, with Foie Gras cream and Madeira: With a base of smooth textured mashed potatoes, the beef was done medium well, and topped with foie gras cream and home-made mustard seeds. Highly recommended!- Brusell Sprouts - Cooked with sliced bacon. Yummy!- The Banana - You get banana ice-cream, banana cream, cake, salted caramel and caramelised banana. What I loved about this dish is the chef sprinkled cut lime pieces onto the dessert. The ‘Wow’ moment came when I ate the dessert with the lime together. Amazing flavour! Post meal, we had two special Christmas cocktails, created by the team at Operation Dagger. - - Chocolate Liquer: The experimental people at Operation dagger created this with Pinot Noir and Cacao and Sous Vide it to infuse the flavours together and bottled it. This reminds me of the liquer-filled chocolates. Try it!- - Chilled Fig Leaf Egg Nog: This was egg-less, and usually served warm. Topped it with nutmeg shavings and served it chilled. One word… Yummy!I enjoyed my meal and I hope the two chefs (who now helm the kitchen) keep going at their craft and keep up the surprising elements that they incorporate into the dishes they prepare.Definitely a meal to remember and I will be back here again soon

Since they opened, I've been there a couple of time, mostly to catch up with friends for a drink.Of course at the opening they got a great publicity due to the fact that Chef Mark Sargeant Chef consultant (one of the protege of the famous Chef Gordon Ramsey) was involve in the food and in collaboration with the General Manager and Head Bartender Luke Whearty, created a nice place to eat and drink in Club Street area...Well, do not get me wrong, there is a lot of places in Club St., and the competition is rude... As I say more competition will give better choice for the customer...read more:http://drinkeattrip.wordpress.com/2014/10/02/oxwell-co

I'd heard mixed review about this place, complains even on the opening night, had been putting me off. We gave the food a try at Savour this year and really enjoyed it so I was encourage to go. We went for drinks a couple of weeks ago with a colleague visiting from the UK. We were given the drinks menu on a photo copied piece of paper, the waitress didn't know what the beers were when we asked, there are only 20 drinks on the menu, you think she would be able to learn them ! 2 of the beers we ordered they didn't have. We also had a G&T and a V&T both tasted odd, when we asked she said the Gin had cinnamon in it, they should state that on the menu. The V&T was flat and tasteless she said that was because it was house pour would I like Grey Goose, this arrived again with flat tonic, when I asked for another she said it will be the same "we use cheap tonic" I had to laugh at her honesty, what a waste of good Vodka. I wont spend my money on the food now after this.As Brit I feel I can say this Mark Sargeant you need to step up your service and stop letting the British restaurant side down in Singapore. . It would go along way if you could be bothered to reply to peoples posts as well
5
Arrived early to the restaurant and got seated. The service personnel taking care of is for the night introduced herself and explained the menu. Her attentiveness to your every needs shows that you're in good hands. No point of time you felt like a customer just having a dinner but a valued guest that is being tend to every moment. Food wise was awesome. Steak tartare and the bread was spot on. The Pan Fried Sea Bass was delicious and the Apple pie was definitely the deal closing matter. Also, they'll surprise you with small mini starters which are different from time to time. It's like little surprises everytime you visit the restaurant. With such and food and service, it'll definitely be worthwhile coming back.
5
I found Oxwell and Co quite by chance after exploring the streets of China Town. It's located in a little enclave of renovated Victorian buildings all with wonderful little restaurants and bars in them. Oxwell has a cool vibe, a very classic, industrial fit out and the staff were 100% helpful especially in pouring ice-cold beer on sweltering humid days... Next time I am back this will be my HQ. Perfect 10 out of 10
2
Yet another Singapore restaurant with a well known executive chef that doesn't deliver - Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Vivo being another example.Before we booked we looked at the website menu, which looked great, some fab Mark Sargeant signature dishes. When we arrived the actual menu was 2 starters, 3 or 4 main courses and 2 desserts. Apparently there was a new chef and he had changed the menu. The choice was extremely limited. We considered leaving but decided to stay and try only a main course as we did not like any of the starters or desserts.My husband had steak and chips which he said was well cooked. I had fish but it was bland.The maître d' was good but the bar staff downstairs seemed disorganised and apparently didn't communicate - our drinks order arrived twice, the original server brought our drinks order about 30 minutes after we had originally ordered them - luckily another server had already brought them (but obviously not told the original server). We were extremely disappointed and won't be going back
2
We went for Sunday lunch with a group of 8 people after hearing good things about their roasts. Upon entry the restaurant is quirky and trying it's best to look like a decent London pub, which was a good sign we thought. Unfortunately it went downhill from here for a number of reasons: 1. Menu - They have basically taken an English Sunday roast and de-constructed it into starters and main course elements with a twist. The Yorkshire pudding is a starter and comes with gravy where the beef is a main and comes with an entirely different black pepper sauce. We had to order pretty much the entire menu in order to put one dish together which was a real shame as they all have different twists and just didn't go together. The chip butty starter is meant to be the original British butty, but they then smother it with burger sauce and ruin it completely - request them not to put it on if you order this! The mains come with nothing, so you have to order all veg separately as well, which is just annoying and a way for the restaurant to make more money. Our mains arrived, but no sides, not for a further 5 minutes meaning the meat went cold under the air con. 2. Service - literally non existent! Some of us waited almost 30 minutes for our drinks despite complaining on several occasions, the food came out slowly and completely randomly, meaning some of us finished even before others had started eating. Throughout the process there was almost no communication from the staff as to what was going on, why the delays occured or anything much of an apology either. It is a real shame as this place could be excellent and the meat was cooked well. However, the poor service and lack of thought put into the menu mean it will be a long time before I return
3
I dropped in for a late lunch on a Saturday. Place was not too busy and I was immediately seated. Had the burger and iced tea. The burger was ok but didn't blow me away. Service was a bit particular. Young crowd enjoying to work in a cool venue. Should be more professional in serving and not hanging out and cracking jokes
3
Nice place to chill in ang saint hill. Only we had to wait a tad long for our drinks. Otherwise all is great.
3
Nice space, ok snacks but the drinks from the tap are a bit weak, better to get the hand mixed drinks. Service is variable, some great staff, some have an attitude. Very hit and miss.
4
Place located in a nice street plenty of bars and restaurants very close to Chinatown.
Nice lager and friendly environment
I enjoyed while waiting to head to the airport
Average singaporean prices (means expensive)
2
A group of 4 friends went for dinner. The food was excellent; exactly the sort of modern British style we were looking for. A superb T-bone with great pork scratching and Yorkshire puds.The maitre d was also very friendly, helpful, chatty and clearly knew her stuff. The rest of the service, however, was that sort of pure comically bad that you only find in Singapore restaurants. It took us 3 attempts and a 45 min wait for a plate of cheese and when the table of 4 ordered a half bottle of desert wine, it was emptied out into 3 glasses and the waitress left the table with that rabbit in the headlights look and we were left to redistribute the wine amongst the 4 of us.Would I go back? I'd like to as the food was good, but with the service standards and at the prices they charge - no way. This needs a serious service wake up call
5
Judging by our experience last Saturday there's quite a few restaurants in Singapore that could learn from Oxwell & Co when it comes to service. After a few disappointing experiences recently it was great to go somewhere that both knew how to prepare their food and serve it.Oxwell & Co menu is modern British with a French influence. The dining room is retro' chic (as is the private dining room) with an open plan kitchen. We started by sharing a Yorkshire Pudding accompanied by mashed oven roast garlic, delicious with the red wine I'd chosen. O&C has an eclectic wine list, most of which you can buy by the glass, so I spent the night indulging in one of my favourite hobbies; experimenting with different wines.We both chose the sirloin steak with fries and onion rings for our main course. Both steaks were cooked just as we asked and the fries and rings were as good as we've ever had, particularly the onion rings. In fact friends who have also eaten here said to us "make sure you order the rings." Must have been good if I'm getting excited about onion rings!For dessert my wife had the lemon posset and I had the chocolate with honeycomb. Mine was good, but my wife decided her dessert was one of the best she'd ever had and that's from someone who normally doesn't go for that type of dessert.As I mentioned at the beginning, service was attentive throughout. We had a good chat with the manager, who is clearly working hard to build the business, and from last Saturday's showing, clearly deserves our support
2
Let's start with the positive, great menu and near perfect cooking with the exception of temperature control, on a table of 6, 3 main courses came lukewarm. The real negatives are, the wine list, whilst attempting to be different I would suggest it is eccentric and gives no real choice, we could not find one white wine that suited the table! Staff upstairs in the restaurant are friendly and attentive which is the converse to the rude, surly team downstairs who are more preoccupied with their mobile phones and social life than wanting to assist customers. A real shame and I hope some one gets hold of these issues before the venture may fail.
5
I had no knowledge of this type of dish and was delighted with the superb taste, then I decided to learn more about Welsh Salt lamb seeing that many of my relations live in South Wales . My research revealed the following - Lambs that graze on salt marshes produce a quality meat that has a unique flavour
5
Found this gem by chance on a self directed walk around the Chinatown district. The lattes were as good (even better) as my regular coffee spot in Brisbane, Australia. The service was excellent and the atmosphere and view from our sidewalk table was charming. Situated on a hill in the Ann Siang Hill, precinct there was a gentle breeze to cool us off in Singapore's heat.
4
Had lunch here during a quick visit to Singapore. The food was very good, and the service friendly and attentive. The upstairs room was a pleasant venue – though it was a bit confusing at first - you could eat downstairs, yes, but if you wanted lunch, you had to eat upstairs. We figured out it was a “full lunch menu” question, but it wasn’t explained very well. That said, our starters and mains were all very good, as was the selection of craft beers. Can’t speak about dinner, but we enjoyed our lunch and would recommend
3
Ann Siang Hill is now closed to traffic on Friday and Saturday nights - which is very cool and makes it into a really fabulous area to stroll and drink and dine. There is nearby parking so don't let the road closure turn you off. Oxwell has a bar downstairs, a restaurant upstairs and another level which is the loos and possibly a private dining area (The Study). Our welcome was not great, but once shown to our table it is a very sweet little dining area. I loved the table settings (the steak knives are serious!) and our waitress was very helpful. The food was lovely, but the prices were high. There was no Cab Sav or Sav Blanc on the menu at all - not by the glass or even by the bottle - which we thought was a bit strange. The unwelcoming lady who didn't really greet us told us it was available downstairs, but not upstairs .........? Pardon? The good news is they have Proseco (which is on tap apparently, as are G & T's, & I am sure the man brought it up from downstairs ........... so .........?). So the prices are about as steep as the stairs. I am glad we went - but probably more because I discovered how much fun we can have elsewhere on Ann Siang Hill : 
5
Very cool London gastro pub in Singapore. I'm quite a foodie from London and was craving good unfussy European food and this place delivers. Very cool interiors too. Must visit.
2
I have tried this place twice now on a Friday night and both times left exasperated after only one drink. I appreciate Club St/Ann Siang Hill is the new "in-place" and will be for the next six months until the next "in-place", and all the bars and restaurants are busy, but please employ some bar staff.Last night we waited for 20 minutes to get 4 on-tap G&Ts then another 10 minutes to pay.The drinks were fine, but if you have 4 thirsty blokes who wander off in search of better service after only one drink, you need to look at how you are operating
5
We had dinner down the street at Noti and had horrible service. We decided to leave after dinner and happened upon this new place. We had amazing service! Our server gave us samples, attended to us very quickly and went the extra mile to make sure everything was great. By the way...the place was packed and we were so surprised and super happy. We'll come back to try out dinner and definitely to have drinks again
2
I don t often write reviews about restaurant but this one really deserves to be written.This place is a huge disappointment. Food was average, menu is not really interesting, quantities are very small, quality is not really there... And the price are ridiculously high...Bad experienc
2
Great concept. Relaxed cosy sophisticated decor. Quality of food - ok - but attention to detail meant some dishes not cooked well. however management have not trained and supported the front line waiters and service staff. As a result loss revenue and dissapointed customers . Won't go again. Another great idea restaurant that will fail in its 1 year.
5
There is no dirth of good establishments in Singapore. Yet Oxwell stands out. I started off with great cocktails (heavenly cuba libres) and g&t on the tap...served with fresh nutmeg leaves. Quality. Proceeded upstairs to the dining leverl. Charming decor, and once again greeted by pleasant staff. Admitedly i was dining with one of the owners, but i can guarantee everyone sitting around me was feeling special. The welsh lamb is to die for. Fed on seawweed it is naturally salty, and the green chutney was a perfect compliment.For deserts, they are among the chosen few that serve eton mess, and other glorious british delights. Took me back to my uni days!!Excellent coffee to top it all off, and i was a happy bunny.Did i mention the great service :)Can't wait for my next visit.
4
Went there for mid week drinks and some bar food (this is not a review of the restaurant). Very nice place to hang around for a couple of drinks. They serve their home made Gin and Tonic and Cuba Libre - both are very good and well worth trying and make a difference to the standard drinks you would order elsewhere. Bar food is a little pricey but very good quality and again a little different that the globe standards served elsewhere. Service is above standard, friendly and prompt
4
Done up as a Victorian bar (think tiling, taps and a stripped back bar), a great venue for a drink with a selection of its own house beverages - beers and G&Ts were particularly impressive - on tap. The dining room upstairs is small and we didn't manage to land a table, but certainly recommended for a few drinks of an evening
4
We recently tried to book this restaurant and called five days in a row, but there was no answer. We had a friend in from Hong Kong, so we decided to go past the restaurant, have a drink downstairs and see if we could get into the restaurant. The bar has a good atmosphere and decor and love the Gin and Tonic. My husband then asked a bar person who had the booking sheet whether he could fit us in as we had tried to call and couldn't get through. He informed us that they were fully booked. Later on my husband asked again whether we could be put on a waitlist and the same bar member was rude and said "we have a very long waitlist". So we gave up and had another drink. Another waitress walked past and had a chat with us (lovely) and asked whether we were enjoying ourselves. We said we were and we had hoped to get into the restaurant, but it was full. She said she would check again and pronto, 2 minutes later we had a table. The restaurant was not full and also if for some reason they had later bookings, we would have been more than happy to be told we had to leave by a certain time if we wanted a last minute table. Well we all know that you staff can make or break your business - thank goodness for the friendly woman who made it happen. The food was good - especially the 1kg steak and the desserts were to die for. Wine is very expensive, but the food was worthwhile. Hopefully they answer the phone next time

Visited the downstairs bar for midweek drinks. First impressions were good... bustling atmosphere and interesting semi-industrial cantina decor, which I thought was a tad strange since my friend had told me it was a "gastropub". We ordered beers and bar food, and spent a good couple of hours in there.The Good:Service was friendly and prompt, and the house brew was pretty tasty. The bar has a nice "lived-in' feel that makes it conducive for catching up with friends.The Bad:Some items on the bar menu are very overpriced. $15 is way too much for a scotch egg, no matter how good it is. Similarly, both the salt and pepper squid and the fries were pretty meagre portions given the price. Quality was decent but unspectacular. The seats are uncomfortable, and the music selection is bizarre. For some reason they had about six or seven instrumentals of well-known hip hop tracks playing on repeat for the entire night. Oh and they serve gin and tonic on tap, which strikes me as pretty gimmicky, although I confess I didn't try it.Overall:I didn't dislike the place, I just feel that they're an example of this whole "small plates" hip dining culture that legitimizes charging a lot of money for very little food. I'll go back for the beer or to try the restaurant, but won't be spending on the bar food again
