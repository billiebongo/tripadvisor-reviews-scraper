Love the place at little Italian Restaurant at Ang Mo Kio.. love the pasta and the service!!! Love to ask my Friend and family to enjoy the foods at PocoLoco
4
Food is tasty and nice but price not cheap though. 2 of us had dinner and we spend $70. I wish they will provide complementary ice water though.
5
Love love love the food at pocoloco!!!! We licked up everything including every shred of cheese! This is a must go place!!!!
5
Good Quality food. It's my 3rd time here. I brought Italians twice and this restaurant passed his Italian tastebuds !!!
4
reservation allowed on friday evening. nice warmly environment in the neighbourhood. affordable good food!
4
Its such a joy having them in AMK. Now its my partner and my fav italian hangout :)
Great food at decent prices. Authentic too.
5
Food is really really good. I would recommend the Tiramisu for dessert to go along with cuppocinno. Its so good. Atmosphere and dining is really comfy and cozy. Plus its feels like you do wanna feel leave.
4
Pet friendly place with out door sitting. Food was very good. I was surprised by the taste of the food as this was located in the heartland. To me it was extraordinary. Would visit again.
4
A no frills kinda italian restaurant suited for the neighbourhood. Food is good and service is also good for the kind of price. Serves a variety of italian food to suit your taste bud. Aircon is strong enough
4
Food are quite pricey for the location and rental they are paying. The price is comparable to those restaurants found in Tanjong Pagar etc. Bought $11 worth of Mussels and one could only had 4 of it. Portion was not generous. Food however, tasted good. Atmsophere was dull and soundproof was bad. Noisy even when there were 7 groups of customers.
5
Couldn't decide on where to eat on New Year, so we decided to have a meal near our home in AMK which wasn't too fanciful yet mundane.
Staff were friendly and food was, as always, a delight.
4
This is a surprise find in neighborhood of Ang Mo Kio. Pasta was done well and soup was tasty. We had a good time.
4
Reservation was easy made through Chope. Location was great with ample of Carpark, Food was good at a affordable price.
4
Pocoloco is a gem at Ang Mo Kio. Why pay an exhorbitant amount for Italian food when you get such good value here!
4
Ambience and interior is good. Offers good and quality Italian dishes at a reasonable price. Calamari was a little chewy though.
3
I ordered two pasta dishes.. it was a very small portion and not satisfying. Had to go elsewhere for another meal (hawker stall chicken rice) after that. The staff also looked very rushed/annoyed when I was making payment. Not even a smile.. Two of us spent around $35. Did not feel like I got my money's worth
3
We have been here twice, the first time was 3 months ago, the pasta, deep fried calamari, the mozarella was not bad. For Ang Mo Kio area, this can be a good find for Italian cuisine. Today I expected a nice dinner with my teen sons but was sorely let down by the deep fried calamari and the scallops. The deep fried calamari was tough, tasted bland, I wouldn't be surprised if it had been tossed back & re-fried.The scallops are 2 small miserable pieces dried and tasteless for $13.50The carbonara was ok declared by my sons.The foie gras is good, but there isn't much that can go wrong with this.I believe standard drops when the place is busy
4
My third time there. Had the day's special of veal. Very tender, well cooked, flavor in the meat. The squid ink pasta was good too. The sauce blended well with the squid rings and pasta. My only complaint would be the soda served are not chilled and it melts the ice too fast. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are good value for yr money.
4
Ordered carbaccio and foie gras appetisers, both very good. Cream of mushroom was good but could be creamier. Lasagne and crabmeat pasta were very good. Personally didn't quite like the seafood creamy pasta but my husband finished it for me! Chocolate lava cake and tiranisu both very good. Esp the tiramisu, they didn't stinge on the liquor
3
Special main course: Beef ribs was tender and I love the sauceWas expecting them to use cheddar cheese in Chicken cordon bleu.. cheese did not ooze out when cut, abit let downMatcha lava cake was good, will try the chocolate lava cake next time
4
We’ve been regular customers at PocoLoco for quite some time already. Each time, every dish we’ve ordered is consistent and tasty. Just a small pity that they removed the appetiser-sized lasagne now. Would be happy to have it back!
5
Food was good. and staff were very attentive and polite. before i could even ask for a refill of hot water for my tea, they came forward and did it without me asking. thumbs up for their service.
5
The Italian food was simply amazing and awesome! Love the pork collar! Their Creme Brûlée is really good, i always here for it! Highly recommend to those who on budget!
4
Ordered their special homemade pasta with lobster ,squid ink pasta, risotto with foie gras and cordon bleu. All dishes are nice except maybe the squid ink pasta with a slightly subtle weird taste
4
Good Italian food at reasonable prices. Atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. Parking was fine even though we went on a Saturday night
5
Had the Boston lobster with handmade tagliatelle neri which reminded me so much of Italy. Love the fegato and melone con parma. Super friendly staff who helped us celebrate a birthday! Definitely recommend this place!!
4
Had the manzo and crabmeat pastas, both were creamy and lovely. All round great pastas in a casual and convenient setting. Staff was nice but forgot one of our appetizers.
4
Had a lovely tenderloin steak, medium rare, really smooth and tender, could be the best steak i've ever had. Ended with a sweet tiramisu. Just hope for more a larger selection of wines by glass and to introduce some beers on tap which wasn't available.
4
Enjoyable family lunch on a hot Saturday and very pleased at the consistently good food served here. Evenings are extremely crowded so I decided to try lunchtime instead. Easier to find a table.
5
The food was simply awesome! It was easy to make reservations too. Will definitely be back for more.
4
Cosy ambience to chat with friends.
Delicious pork collar was tender and served with caramelised onions- value for money. Lava cake oozed with molten chocolate and served with vanilla ice cream.
4
We had dinner here a few times with my friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. Food was very good for the value of money you’re paying. Must try!
4
I ordered Manzo and Granchio. The Manzo was fantastic. Granchio was pretty normal. The place does not serve water, and the wines are pretty pricey too ($50 and above). The place only accepts cash and nets.
4
The pasta never fail to deliver. Love the squid ink pasta. The foie gras is good too! Dessert wise they are not that good but the rest are above expectation. A hidden gem.
5
we had a dinner for 4 adults and 1 toddler here, and we were really very satisfied. not only was the quality of food here great, one of the best italian food we had, but the prices were really very affordable as well. we had 2 starters to share (the cheese platter and the mussels) which were a great opener, and 4 pastas and a mushroom soup as our mains, paired with a bottle of their house white wine. each pasta dish had a distinct taste, each was delicious and hit the spot. the service was prompt and friendly as well. all in all the bill came up to under S$140. would definitely come back again
5
Came here to celebrate a birthday in the family. Food was authentic and delicious, staff were very attentive and the prices were reasonable... spent about $300 for 9 people. My father's only qualm was that for an Italian restaurant, they served a double espresso in a large cup (instead of a proper espresso cup), coffee was only 1/3 the volume of the large cup! But this was the only small issue that we had. All in all, would definitely recommend this restaurant to others
4
I was introduced to this little gem of a restaurant by a friend, and have found it delightful. Food quality is good, prices reasonable and ambience pleasant. Would recommend it as a place to go to for good food without having to pay through oneâ€™s nose. Keep up the good work
3
First time here after many times at the Jurong outlet. Generally food was well cook, flavorsome. Things wrong:1) Don't serve water. Why is it a big deal providing water when staff is free and we don't like mineral water ?2) Bottled beer is over-priced.3) Barramundi has a strange bitter taste.4) Staff not attentive: did not top-up serviettes, forks, spoons, did not help in moving chair
5
We weren't able to get our indoor seat. But the food is just so nice and I have no problem with that. Their Creme Brulee is really good. and the pasta is well-cooked. However I'd prefer to have a slightly harder Risotto. All in all, it was a nice experience
4
This place is the true meaning of hidden gem. The unassuming location, first impression is like, "okay, lower your expectations guys"... boy were we wrong! The food was spectacular. The mushroom soup was filling and not your heat from can soup. The granchio (crab) pasta was SO DELICIOUS! Definitely coming back
5
visit poco loco for some laid back but delicious italian food. highly recommended to those on a budget
5
We ordered different dishes and everyone enjoyed their meals. I like the appetiser and the pork chop.
4
I revisited this place for a date night and it did not disappoint. The squid ink pasta is especially good. However, the matcha lava cake dessert was too watery for my liking.
5
The food at Pocoloco was excellent and it's really value for money. Service staff was attentive and pleasant.
4
Chillax place, comfortable with nice music, food were delicious, staff were okay, hope they can smile more.
4
Pocoloco offers a great mix of Italian food at a great and reasonable price point. Plenty of choices from seafood to pastas and risottos. I'll definitely be back for more.
5
The food is good & value for money. Italian food which is pocket friendly and worth a visit in the heartland of Singapore.
5
Every dish we ordered, it blew me away. I kept telling my friend whom else would really love this.....so we organized another visit this coming weekend to the Microbrewary outlet in Jurong!Ordered foei gras appetizer....super duper good. We also had scallop, crab meat pink pasta, pork collar, tiramisu and matcha lava cake.
1
I visited the restaurant 2 times in total . My first visit was for lunch, food was value for money, service was passable which is why I decided to visit for the second time for dinner.My second visit was "memorable". We went in at 8 plus 9 . Their service time was till 10pm. We ordered 1 appetiser , 1 main course each for the 2 of us and a dessert . Our drinks were late, our main course order wrong , which they re did the order (which is still ok for me). Best part is -- as I noticed that the closing time was near I asked for my dessert to be served AND for my bill. I was prepared to quickly finish my dessert and leave the restaurant. The dessert came -- all packed for in ready to go containers. I was bewildered .. my dessert was lava cake with ICE CREAM and they packed it for me to take away as they r closing . They did not asked me if I wld like to take away the dessert as they r closing , mind you-- I asked for the dessert to b served. Then they just handed me the bill. I felt it was v rude and uncalled for. I wld b hv obliged to take away if they asked but they made me feel like they r chasing me away.So , if u r planning to visit the restaurant -- for food I wld say value for money BUT I will not b goin to the restaurant in a long time to come
4
Pocoloco manages to serve better than average Italian fare at very affordable prices .Some dishes better than others obviously - definitely try the beef carpaccio and the puttanesca. But the best part in my view is the way they serve their beer in an ice holder, which keeps the beer cold throughout the meal.
4
Prices are reasonable compared to other restaurants of similar setup. Foie gras was good!
Location is not the most convenient though.
5
One of the most affordable and good italian food in the heartlands of Singapore. Highly recommended!
5
good services & yummy Italian food , quiet place , good to have a slow dining relaxing meal and its value for $$
4
Good Pasta at reasonable price. Nice creamy Pasta at affordable price, in the neighbourhood! Ordered the Seafood Pasta and the beef pasta (but very little beef).
5
Unexpectedly great food for its price. Especially recommend getting the squid ink pasta! The toilet could be better though.
3
Pasta was great for the affordable pricing however, service was slightly compromised when our order was mixed up by the waiter.
2
Food is on the expensive end considering that it is located at heartland area, and the portion is small and the taste is really plain. especially the Porcini which is a tad bit salty. But the choco lava cake damn good. The service is commendable though
4
Pocket friendly due to the location. Very small indoor seating area and hence was seated outside so not really nice environment to dine due to hot weather (esp for lunch). Furthermore, every passer-by look out of curiosity while eating so make reservation in advance for indoor table unless one prefers to be watched. Food wise nothing to complain for the price but pasta and risotto were quite oily as you could see the oil on the plate. Calamari very hard and chewy (overcooked!). Will visit again if craving for casual Italian food
3
Was impressed by their media review so we gave it a try. Staff were friendly and helpful. But I find the menu not so friendly like the staff. A menu full of words does not help me understand what are they. Guess photos will be great! So..i have ended up ordered food we don't like. Sad experience
5
Very well priced food & great quality overall. We enjoyed the beef carpaccio, burrata, a couple of the pastas. The seafood risotto wasn't great but otherwise everything else we had were excellent! Desserts were great too.Only gripe is it can get a bit warm inside on a hot day, but overall definitely recommended
5
Food is delicious and affordable price.Good place for chill with friends..Unique dish with good taste..Convenience place
4
Food was great, & offers fantastic value for $!! 3 adults & 1 kid. Staff were attentive, efficient & friendly.. the mushroom soup & the Filleto de Manzo were Yumz!!
4
Was a little hesitant but was eventually persuaded to try this place out. Portions slightly small but of decent quality. Air conditioning could be better!
5
A small homely Italian restaurant. Some of their signature dishes's taste surpass expensive famous Italian restaurants. Overall, it's good value for the quality of the food. Quantity & presentation of food lack slightly.
4
Tried New Zealand oysters, funghi, iberico pork collar with salsa verde, pollo ala Milanese, crab in pink sauce pasta and end with Creme brûlée , fantastic meal, will be back again .
2
2 scallops for the price of $12++ is ridiculous. They dont taste spectacular either. The crabmeat pasta in pink sauce &carbonara were both very jelat. Tiramisu had too much mascarpone cream. Death by cream meal.
3
We ordered the spaghetti vongole. There was a generous amount of clams which is good but I felt the wine sauce was too little to coat my pasta to get the taste. We also had the risotto porcini which had a tinge of truffle oil and that added flavor to the dish but there weren't much of the porcini. I had the caesar salad as a side which was not good because the lettuce was soggy and the dressing was so-so. But on the whole, for the dishes we ordered, it was good value for money
4
Saw the review on a blog and wanted to try the burrata salad and crab meat pasta. For slightly over 10$, I thought it was pretty value for money! Delicious and al dente, the way i like it:) But my bf's vongole was a tad too tough and not as savoury as he'd like it. Lava cake was runny, but too sweet. Overall a good experience
4
Definitely worth going when craving a pasta fix. No fancy atmosphere (altho still very decent, like a casual diner), but that is reflected in its very reasonable pricing. We had the Manzo (Truffle, mushroom and beef) and Pink Sauce Crab pastas, and a White Wine Clam starter. All good and perfectly al dente. Basket of bread is chargeable at $3 or so, which makes sense to me. :
4
It is good to make a reservation, they gave us a table where we could see the chef decorating the dishes, esp the desserts and steak, gave my good appetite another booster.I recommended the Tiramisuthough the presentation of the mascarpone cheese could have been better. Its brandy layer had to be eaten together with the mascarpone cheese to enjoy the super taste. Have not tried a Tiramisu so close in taste to those tasted in Italy. Bravo
1
Do not go to this place it's full of bugs and the management knew the wooden chairs and tables outdoor is in bad conditions and did not warn us about this!
For cheap food yes but for the pain and scars left behind is unbearable!
5
Food was delicious and the prices do not break the bank. This place is definitely worth a visit. No regrets!
5
The location is accessible but hard to find. The pasta was good just that the chicken is a bit tough seems like it just came out of the freezer.
5
I came back for the food and the friendlinest of the staff. Not sure whats her name but she is polite friendly and cheerful...and honestly i really came back more for the tea stick! Haha.
4
We visited this restaurant with my family to celebrate Father's Day. The pastas are value for money.
4
As the title says, and this restaurant had good Italian cuisine that isn't situated in the city areas or shopping mall, worth a trip down there to taste it yourself!
4
The daily special was recommended and it was pretty good. The quail was cooked perfectly. The chicken liver pate is a little strong in flavour and aftertaste but not so overpowering. Beef lasagne was good.
5
Food is good and decent...
Staff are really attentive and prompt(:
Will definiately return for more!

Ordered Bolognese and my friend ordered the Pasta delle Langhe aka dry egg pasta. We also had calamari for sides and lava cake ($10) for dessert. The total bill came up to $41 for 2. The place is an open cafe concept under a HDB block, and there was a sharp piercing sound seemingly coming from the kitchen whenever something is switched on. It goes off after awhile. My bolognese order was good. It was decent. However, my friend's dry egg pasta was terrible! It was super bland, as though the chef forgot the salt? It appeared like wanton mee noodles only, plain without any ingredients. That dish was disappointing. The calamari was very averagely done, extremely chewy and semi-hard, it could have been better. The dessert could be warmed, so that it gives the molten lava cake experience, that would have justified the price for the dessert.Overall, I felt that it was disappointing as the food did not justify the price, it should be more affordable given the quality and environment. However, the service staff was friendly. I would return to have the bolognese but not the others that we've ordered.
4
Small Italian restaurant within the heartlands that can seat 32 indoors and another 24 outdoors. Space is tight but they managed to get a decent seating layout. Indoor seats near entrance don't really get the coolness of the aircon though they do have an aircurtain at the entrance.We started with had the cold melon soup with Parma ham. Unique taste of sweet and salty in one dish. It was not tagged as dessert but one of the 3 soups in the menu. Thre catch of the day was Pan seared Red Snapper in Porcini Cream sauce. We felt it was creamy but a tad salty.Manzo is a creamy beef pasta. Tasty but could be deemed overwhelming if one is not into creamy food.Tagliata Manzo is supposed to be thinly sliced beef tenderloin with rucola salad. The slices were more like chunks. Taste of the beef was good. Special of the day was the Roasted Sirloin Angus Beef served w/garlic & shallot confit. I asked for medium rear and it was done just right. Good balance of tenderness of the beef and flavour from the garlic n shallot sauce.We added the calamari to our order. It was a tad salty for this family.For dessert we had their Tiramisu which was extremely good. Not too sweet but flavorful.Interestingly the straws they serve with their drink glasses have been trimmed. Not too sure if it's to match the glass or cost saving measure. Fyi they don't serve complimentary water here.Overall its a nice place with pleasant staff and above average food quality. They do accept reservations which is a big plus for such a small restaurant.For the food above and drinks we paid S$26 per person.
3
Food wasn't bad, but not that great. could be better. we made reservations and was on time. However due to overwhelming crowd, we had to sit outside which was quite warm due to the hot weather recently.
4
The restaurant really blew our minds away. Situated in a nice AMK neighbourhood, good food, good prices. All prepared from scratch!
5
I enjoyed my beef truffle pasta, it was good. The beef could have been more tender though. The escargots were alright.
5
Have been here several times for Pocoloco's excellent food at very affordable prices, with good service too! Worth coming for a meal.
5
Staff were friendly, food tasted great, had their crab meat pasta in pink sauce, mushroom aglio olio and seafood zaffereno all were nice. Baked scallops were delish but only 2 pieces.
4
The place is nicely decorated and cosy. Staff are friendly and service is prompt. Food is as good as restaurant but prices are lower.
An interesting choice if you happen to drop by amk ave 10.
4
Worth the price for the food. Cozy place for family who likes Italian foods. The Lava cakes with ice cream is a must try dessert.
5
Nice food with good ambience. Good for families and friends. It will be better if rst provide wifi:)
5
Food was good, price was affordable and the service was excellent. Will definitely visit again, worth it
5
Pocoloco (Ang Mo Kio) is a 5-star restaurant in the midst of the HDB home ground. Service was impeccable and friendly. Soups and pasta were fantastic. Price is very reasonable. 7 of us dined and everyone sang praises of the food and service. Will definitely come again and recommend to others.
3
Affordable Italian fare but quality of food is only normal. Location could be quite inconvenient without a car.
3
Small portions, heavy on flavours.
Mushroom soup - too watery but flavourful due to truffle oil.
Granchio - cheese and tomato overpower taste of crab meat. Crab meat is too little.
Tiramisu - pack a punch of sweeetness + cheese.
Friendly service stuff.
4
The food was extremely delicious. I ordered the Bologise spaghetti and the restaurant used another form of pasta. When I asked if I could change to the normal spaghetti, they gladly changed it. For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake. It was awesome too. On the whole, I had a lovely experience at Pocoloco
5
Came here twice, once with my wife and once with a friend and both times the food was equally good. To have an aglio olio or vongole pasta at abt $10 each, u cant really ask for more. Their vongole isnt the usual white clams u have at the local supermarket in Spore and is alot juicier and has a tinge of sea-ish taste, which was lovely. Their sauteed mushroomsm just equally good and of course their beers! Initially we thought that their beers were really expensive as we ordered a jug, only to realise that jug is probably double the size of the normal 1.2-1.3l ones anywhere else. We had the green beer and their owner (Winston) gave us free samplers of the rest too, which we really appreciate. Overall, great place, nice music, tasty food and ice cold beers. What else can we ask for? My rating: 8.5/1
5
My second time here and the food didn't disappoint! I had the mushroom risotto while my partner had the vogole Bianca. Their appetizers, the baked scallops was really yummy and nicely done. The staff was warm and meticulous. And the best thing, is the affordable pricing:) Totally enjoyed this experience!
5
My husband and I had our dinner at this cafe with our dog. The staffs were very friendly and got us a corner outdoor table, which is a very nice arrangement because our dog is fearful of crowd and with a corner table, there wont be unnecessary fear for other patrons. The pastas were good and reasonably priced too
5
This is my 4th time to Poco Loco at AMK. I chose the restaurant because my brother loves Italian food and this restaurant serves a good and affordable meal. We had the 2 mushroom soups, the calamari appetizer, a rucola and a caesar salad, mushroom risotto, pork chop, crab meat pasta, seafood aglio olio (a special request by my brother), a tiramisu and 2 lava cakes. All of it was good and when my younger gal spilled her water, the server promptly came with a cloth and cleaned it up with a smile. The staff also humoured my elder gal when she specifically asked for purple children's cutlery. We will definitely be back again. Thank you for your warm service :
4
Quality Italian food at a reasonable price tag. Service is prompt, servers are friendly and helpful. They have everyday special written on the board which you might like to look out. If you like anything truffle, the menu has quite a spread of truffle infused dishes.
4
Guess the headline covers it..had dinner with a friend. Friendly staff known to my friend. First time for me. We had BYO wine + ordered a bottle there. Choice is limited but given the location and the price, nothing to complain about. Food was also in the average category. If I recall we had Burata, Risotto and Creme brulee..all of them quite decent in terms of taste and portion size..Worth a visit
3
Food is good, price is fair however credit card is not accepted.Table reserved for us is in front of the serving counter , where it's not that ideal because , the servor will walk around again and again to pick up food to serve the table
