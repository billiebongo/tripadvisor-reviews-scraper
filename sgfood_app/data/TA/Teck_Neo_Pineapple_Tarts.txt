Don't be fooled by their modest setup. This family run eatery whips up a wonderful array of authentically flavoured Peranakan and local dishes. Ordered their Dry Mee Siam, Assam Fish, Chicken Rendang and Kueh Pie Tee. One of the best I've ever had.

Have visited this eatery many times. The one-person portion is good for sharing. Always order the Yeh sense old dishes because of the same old tastiness. Dry Nee siam, tahu goreng, laksa, ngo-hiang, nasi lemak, kueh pie tee are our all time favourites.

We returned this morning for an early linch and they were gearing up formthe Lunar New Year, with cookies galore on sale.The kueh dada was good, though the ang ku kueh was slightly thick. The peanut filling was nice, if a tad sweet. The nyonya bak chang was tasty. Thy did not have their signature large chang. The fried chicken in the nasi lemak dish was delicious, with a nice taste of ginger. The egg with onion was also good, but the chilli was on the sweet side. The dry mee siam was not as good as previously, however

Our HK guest wanted something different than the usual restaurants in Vivocity. Hence we brought him to this Nonya restaurant that is near our office. We spend some time explaining the term of nonya. :) The shop owner is very kind, recommended dishes to us. There are total 5 of us. Chicken rendang, curry fish, fried mee siam, Nyonya Kuih Pie Tee, ngor ngiang. All are very good indeed. My personal preference is the Chicken Rendang and Kuih Pie Tee

The Peranakan food here is, in my humble opinion, out of this world. Sure the servings are a little small but the taste is ohhhhhh.... My favorite? The humble bagadil. Light on flour and heavy on potato and other ingredients, this is the real deal! Absolutely delicious!

Visited for Sunday lunch with the in-laws and the small eatery was packed, even around 2 pm. And little wonder, as the food is still as good and prices are still reasonable. We ordered two dishes of 'Dry' mee siam, and they were delicious, as were the Kueh Pie Tee. I also ordered a rempah Ayam Goreng, together with an order of Chicken rice with pineapple, and they were mouthwatering. In fact, my fellow diners kept picking from my plate.We also enjoyed the various kueh kueh, such as Kueh dadah (pandan-infused pancake filled with gula melaka and coconut mix) and the Rempah udang. The three rice dumplings were not too bad, though a tad pricey. The nonya ngoh hiang was also okay, but not outstanding.Service was good, as always, and very fast. They open from 730 most days, though they are closed on Mondays

We were there for lunch and had one of the best Gado Gado dishes in a long time. It was a huge portion with a bowl of dipping sauce. We sampled the Tauhu Goreng and Ngoh Hiang and found it to be really good too, not too spicy and full of flavour. The desserts were next and we tried the Burbur Cha Cha and it was not fantastic, but pass-able. Will be back for more next week, especially the Kueh Pai Tee and lumpur. Makko was at hand to tell us of her challenges in producing this wonderful spread

Teck Neo might be known for its pineapple tarts esp around CNY but it's their simple Nyonya fares that really deliver culinary nirvana experiences.In this sleepy part of Singapore, Teck Neo produces probably the best dried Mee Siam and outstanding Kweh Pie Ti, curries and Nasi Lemak. The menu is simple and limited but everything is superbly executed.In fact, I find that it's their pineapple tarts that still has ample rooms to improve

This was our second trip back here, on our return to Singapore. Tucked away in a corner shop in a low rise building, they serve cheap yet delicious Peranakan food.Their signature dishes include dry mee siam, which we like as it is flavourful and tangy, and the laksa, which we found was ordinary though. But their other dishes such as ngoh hiang (sliced fried meat roll), kweh pie tee (crispy shells with bamboo, shrimp and turnip) and fried chicken with basmati rice were very tasty.Do also try their nonya bak chang, which is filled with diced pork. The pineapple tarts come in various sizes and are quite nice, though I find the filling to be on the sweet side.Prices are very reasonable, with the mee siam and laksa starting from $5.50. Service is friendly and easy. Do note that they do get crowded, but do not take reservations
