We celebrate our special occasion at St Regis Hotel LaBrezza for the past years and it has always impressed us with great food and service. Looking forward to dine at LaBrezza again. Thanks Gary, Jason and Koai for their excellent service.

It was our wedding anniversary & this was made excellent by Paul, who is a very helpful and knowledgeable. He helped us with his recommendations and was very patient throughout despite us being slightly demanding. He was always smiling and sincere in his offerings.Great job Paul and thanks for the amazing evening

I booked Sunday Brunch as a birthday present several weeks in advance. I called the day before to confirm as it was an important occasion. I was told that the Sunday Brunch had been cancelled. No reason, they did apologise, they had my reservation but clearly did not find it important enough to call me when they made this decision a few weeks ago
5
Good food good service.Paul who served us was great. He is friendly, detailed and most importantly i love his smile.. good jon Paul. Is nice to know such great people like you. Happy Valentine to you to
5
Amazing service and the knowledgeable staff , Anand , was on hand with a smile and excellent information about the food . Ordered the cod , which was very fresh and the chicken was delicious too. Will return because of the staff who was attentive . Thk you LaBrezza , it was indeed a love evening
5
Came here with my friend for the Italian weekend seafood buffet lunch and found it to be very worth it. Service was great and there was a wide variety of seafood. We were just hoping there would have been pizza and pasta included as well as gelato for desert
5
Chef Jaden prepared a seafood agli olio with squid ink pasta - delicious. Perfect balance of everything. The dessert with raspberry sorbet and gianduja cremeaux was so good, too. Service staff were very accommodating and friendly, thanks to Paul, Jeff, and Jessa. Great new menu also. Got the chance to speak with Chef Armando who informed me that there will be a new brunch concept soon. Will be back and cant wait to try it
5
We were flying early in the morning and wanted a lite dinner. We went to LaBreeza and had an great Italian pizza with a glass of wine. The menu is limited and everyone was complementing the chef on his creations. Next time we are going for the full meal.
5
Celebrated my husband's birthday on Friday's BBQ night together with family. Very courteous and lovely service staff. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience; food quality and choices were excellent. Definitely highly recommended
5
the chef was not just incredible but went out of his way to introduce himself and really excelled at making the most delicious Italian food. You don't often expect authentic Italian food in Asia but this chef was certainly incredible and comes from Italy himself after being in the Middle East.
4
My wife and I wanted to have a quiet evening with some great food and this turned out to be a really nice experience. Lovely service from the staff - particularly, Anand who was incredibly attentive but left us to dine in peace too. The food was really interesting - we both really enjoyed the deconstructed desserts in particular. Nice early evening meal
5
Had an absolutely amazing time with my family when I had dinner at La Brezza the other night.The chef’s signature dish “Astice Burrata” truly lived up to its name, the perfectly seasoned cubed vegetables along with creamy burrata cheese and fresh lobster was a perfect combination of flavours melding in my mouth. The main course I had ,”Merluzzo Patata” was also to die for. Perfectly seasoned cod brought out the freshness and sweetness which was paired with beautiful purple potato and a unique lemon anchovy sauce. Finally for my dessert I had their “Gianduia with Raspberry sorbet”.The delicious creaminess and nuttiness of the gianduia mousse melted in my mouth and the sweetness and slight acidity of the raspberry sorbet just cut through the heaviness of the mousse which made it simply incredible. The cherry on the cake was when a simplistic yet beautiful plate with a smooth and decadent chocolate cake was brought to me when the service staff found out it was my birthday. Much thanks to Chef Armando , Simone and Jaden for the amazing dinner and I will definitely be back for more
3
The standard of food has dropped a lot probably due to the new Chef. Too much salt in the squid ink pasta and their recommended cod fish taste and felt like our local fishball. Sad to say that the only decent dish was the complimentary bread basket...However one staff stood out amidst all these - Mr. Jefferson. Jefferson was most apologetic that our food did not go well. He gave us a complimentary dessert and also honoured my SPG 10% discount even though I did not have my SPG card with me. In the end I was given a 25% discount off the bill.Although we did not have a fantastic food experience here this time compared to our previous visits, Jefferson's little actions and genuine service warmed us. Hope they can relook at their poor execution of Italian cuisine but still I give a two thumbs up for the wonderful service by Jefferson (and his team)
4
No lunch and was hungry at 4+pm. Called and told them “will arrive shortly, get your chef ready”. Ordered cod and scallops, 2 different mains and both were good. Portions were small but yummy and delicious
5
Our first visit in lebrezza it was very good the food is very fresh staff is very good specialy the jefferson is very good and cheff armando cook very excellent food
5
My 2nd time visited in this spectacular italian restaurant,chef armando, jessa, anand, and paul always deliver a bespoke service, from starter to dessert food was really really awesome..best address in singapor
5
Our second visit to Labrezza and once again an excellent evening. Friday night is a bbq night, so as well as a good selection of antipasti and fresh seafood there was a good selection of bbq food on offer too.Free flow alcohol options also available and good dessert selection.It was my birthday and so they kindly brought out a cake for the family to sing along too, plus the chef came out and we made tiramisu with him at the table which was fun
4
Seafood was very fresh. Besides the usual cold seafood, there were barbecued lobsters and prawns. Lamb was cooked to perfection. Not a wide variety of food selection though.
4
Had lunch with a business associate recently. The set lunch was pretty good value. It’s a little far away from the CBD so not many business types. Nice and quiet and service was quick and efficient. Enjoyed the bean soup and the fish. The sorbet was nothing extraordinary
5
Had a great fine dining experience at La Brezza St. Regis Hotel last night. It was our second time actually, as me and my husband love not just the food but the great service their staffs provide as well. Shoutout to the server named Paul, he was awesome. And to the staffs Jessa and Alvin, great service you guys gave us. To the chefs Simone and Jadon, the food was awesome. I reckon these guys does their job with passion and are one of the best chefs in town. Thanks for making our Anniversary dinner a memorable one. Thumbs up! I highly recommend this restaurant. Looking forward to our next visit.
5
Like all restaurants in the St Regis, LaBrezza is great for a quick casual bite, try the Beef Burger
3
Whats with Singaporeans these days! Anything expensive is delicious is it? Nothing spectacular. Yeah Lobsters all you can eat, but the beef is bland the lamb was the saving grace for me. No mint for the lamb? No gravy for their steak?Salmon was ok and Seabass also. As Gordon Ramsey would say "season season season".The hype was just because this guy from youtube make it feel that everything he tasted was super delicious, well there are other buffets with lower price point than this and taste better than delicious.The staff was great with their service, sad to say the food didnt do as much
5
Elegant and charming environment managed by top professional staff caring each customer need with a friendly and dedicated approach. In addition to the menu a la carte, The evening was proposing a Barbeque buffet able to meet all possible different tastes (fish, meat, vegetables....) and the chef Simone Montanaro offered us a special attention supporting our 7 years old daughter requests. We had a great dinner turning our evening in something special and unforgettable. Congratulation and thanks guys for the great experience you gave us! Paol
5
Highly recommended. We ordered truffle pasta, pizza, dessert. Chef gave us a white pizza to match the pasta. dessert recommended matches the truffles tasting from the start... wonderful. This chef knows what he is doing. Superb! Truly enjoyed the experience.
5
The restaurant staff and overall environment was wonderful. Food and service was excellent too, choice of BBQ items was just enough to keep you full throughout the whole 3 hours of buffet.
3
Nothing special for us celebrating, we couldnâ€™t enjoy using the HSBC promotion. Food was lack of spices e.g. risotto , service was superb.
5
Food was good and value for money. Besides the lobsters and the BBQ offerings, the antipasti and desserts on offer were also excellent. Service and attitude of the staff at the restaurant were also fantastic
3
For the price paid, I was expecting better customer service. Approached Alvin to ask if coffee and tea are included, his attitude was rather nonchalant, to think he is one of the senior supervisor. Food wise, good quality but not much variety. seems like they do not really replenish the food, especially the barbecue counter.
5
This Italian restaurant on the 2nd floor of the St Regis Hotel overlooks the swimming pool and has inside and outside seating. The food and service are of the highest standard. If you order lobster you choose it from the tank. Our sea bass was delicious
5
The service team and the food here is amazing! I came here to celebrate dad's birthday and my parents loved the atmosphere and the food. Recommend this place to those who wants a great dinning experienc
5
I would like to commend laBrezza for their excellent service and good food. The ambiance is great, the staffs are very good, friendly, & accommodating especially Jessah & Alvin , Chef Simone for the wonderful dishes. All the best
5
A youtube video made us curious so we tried it out and it didn't disappoint. It was totally worth it with all the unlimited lobster (chilled and grilled)! The appetizer selection was also good - especially the one with the eggplants.Service was great! Jessa was just awesome - very generous, helpful and courteous.Only regret was I stuffed myself with too much chilled lobster and shrimp, should have made more room for the grilled items
5
My friend and I went there for a lunch. Upon our artival, at the entrance of restaurant we were greeted by Jefferson.He showed us to our table. Throughout our lunch he and his other colleagues came by to enquire if all was well with our orders
5
Labrezza has a nice and relaxing ambiance. Im very thankful to the very welcoming and accomodating staff there named jessah,alvin and chef simone who made our very delicious food.Bacause of them i feel so comfortable in this place and im pretty sure that ill be coming back again and again. Thanks again to jessah who always approached us to make sure that we are serving well. Keep up the good job.
5
Had my short vacation in Singapore and one night i just decided that i want to eat some good food.. my hotel that i stayed in was kinda near St. Regis Singapore, so i went there i found this italian restaurant inside called Labrezza.. the ambiance was so nice and relaxing.. when i entered the resto i was welcomed by the staff there named Paul, Jessa and Jefferson with big smiles and warm hospitality and then they seated me next to the pool area view.. Paul intriduced me to their executive Chef, Chef Armando.. fast forward to the food.. My god all i can say that their food is superb! And the champagne gosh haha thank you labrezza staff.. (will post some pics for proof ) aside from their amazing food what really struck me is that how the people working there are taking care of each guest.. i feel like i am a vip guest that night.. kuddos to them.. to all people who will read my message i recommend this place in Singapore.. all is perfect and awesome ❤️
5
Wonderful hospitality. Friendly environment. Authentic Italian. Would like to try their weekend brunch.
2
For a restaurant located in such a wonderful hotel, unfortunately LaBrezza fell far short of expectations. - Asked a few times for a wine menu, however we were never asked for an order- Hair in our daughters meal- Tables nearby were not cleared for our entire meal (hour and a half)- No olive oil with the bread (although we asked)- Sea bass main looked promising but the broth lacked any flavour- An open kitchen is great to see a restaurant chef's at work. However it doesn't work that well when the chef is arguing with the front of houseIn hindsight, our family should have visited some nearby restaurants instead
5
We ate here as a part of the travel deal that we had and were very pleasantly surprised.There was a set course menu and all of the courses were simple dishes that were bursting with flavour. From the carparcio, through to the tiramisu, nothing disappointed.The service was subtle and not intrusive, but you felt like you were the centre of attention. A very enjoyable evenin
5
Had breakfast while staying at the hotel. Selections were limited but the setting is comfortable with open air and swimming pool
5
Wow, wow, wow...what a wonderful, delectable dinner we had at LaBrezza last night.My husband ordered Chef Armando's 6 course degustation. My son had the pasta with Lobster and I pasta with clams. Oh, me oh, my. He definitely did not disappoint. The Risotto/scallop topped with caviar was for me the best combination. It was truly a delight. My son's lobster was tender, sweet and succulent paired with just the right freshness from the tomato base sauce. The clams on my pasta was not rubbery, just right and the pasta was al dente, just the way I like it. My husband's degustation ended with a presentation on their take on Tiramisu which was soooooo yummy. Wait staff was super attentive, kind and on hand. Specially Paul.We are new Expats in Singapore. Originally from NYC and lived in the D.C. area for a few years. We have traveled all over Italy a few times. But...by far, this was one of our best Italian meals. Thank you Chef Armando for bringing your Napoli roots to Singapore and sharing it with us at LaBrazza this evening with my family. We will be back ;0
5
It's been a few months since our last visit to LaBrezza, so we decided to drop in and try the food again to see if they could maintain the high standard that they set at the beginning of the year. Chef Armando was very friendly and came over to greet us when we were just seated. And the main thing was the food, and Chef Armando did not disappoint..... almost every course was like a work of art, nice to look at, and tasted even better when you eat it.The Lobster Tagliolini was superb with generous and large servings of fresh lobster pieces. And the Angus Beef Striploin was perfectly done too. And my wife also liked the Lamb Loin with Jerusalem Artichoke.Armando told us that he would be revamping the entire menu in October, so we are looking forward to it
5
Bring your swim wear. Sit outside. Wonderful pool. Amazing seafood buffet. Service a bit slow - so it's the sort of place you come to when you want to rest and have a lazy time

La Brezza located at Tanglin rd. The St. Regis Singapore Set amidst tranquil surroundings, itâ€™s a treasured gem that promises diners a delectable experience of an Italian cuisine. We decided to go to this restaurant based on other reviews and we were very happy with our decision. The staff were very pleasant and the food was outstanding. Fantastic food we tried several things on the menu and all where very good. We had no favourite because they were all excellent. . Anyhow the Food is very well presented and nice portions too, but the true highlight of the night was definitely the food, it was absolute perfect. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
5
Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at La Brezza. Food was excellent. Well prepared. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Jason in particular was very helpful with suggestions and recommendations
5
I have had the best service and food at Labrezza @st Regis Singapore for very long time- I was with a friend and wanted to have a nice evening and excellent food, that what we got and even beyond! Matt the Manager understand exactly what we were after, the head chef sorry forgot his name prepared a tasting menu on the spot! Nothing was too much and we felt very special! Thank you and Bravo to all the team there. We will remember our evening for very long time!
5
LaBrezza's Friday BBQ should be on the list of must-visits for travellers and locals alike. The wide selection of finely prepared antipasti, seafood and cooked-to-order BBQ delights, coupled with attentive and welcoming service, make for a great evening with family or friends. The regular menu prepared by Chef Armando and his team is equally exceptional, with a level of creativity and presentation that sets the cuisine apart from Singapore's crowded profusion of fine Italian eateries. The atmosphere by the poolside is both relaxed and elegant, with a reasonable price tag given the caliber of the food
5
I have visited this restaurant for the second time since I wanted to try the brunch Family Style...and again I have to say...chef Armando very well done!!!I had the feeling to be in Italy and the real authenticity of the dishes served was impressive.If you are in Orchard area you have to try La Brezza Restaurant in this Beautiful Hotel by CHEF ARMANDO
5
We loved it. Jason, Matt and abhishek ran a tight ship and kept us plied with Prosecco over a birthday celebration. The bbq was fresh, delicious and made as we liked it. Will be back soon, with friend
5
Was looking for a restaurant to have a good dinner and I made the right decision to try this restaurant! The dishes and wine recommended by Janine was excellent, service provided by Jishen(?) was very attentive, and Chef Simone going to my table and asked how everything is and even explained the story behind the dishes - all highly commendable! Their "deconstructed" Tiramisu is a MUST try. Thanks for the lovely evening labrezza team! Cant wait to try more...
5
Had a really enjoyable dinner. Both Chef Armando and the manager Mateusz are really nice. Came by a few times to check on us and make sure that things were alright. The tiramisu was unique and outstanding. Chef Armando's own creation. He even came to our table and showed us how to put it together. The pork ragout pasta was delicious. The burrata pizza, an off menu item, was also great. Ambience was good too. We sat in indoor comfort with Aircon and had a nice view of the pool. We will be back to try the degustation menu which contains many of Chef Armando's signature dishes.
5
Great food prepared by Chef Armando he is very creative in all the dishes. Tiramisu is a must eat dessert! Excellent service team led by Restaurant Manager Matt.
5
Visited LaBrezza for dinner and the food was excellent. Tiramisu was extra special as the chef came out and demonstrated his way of having it. Special shoutout to the Sommelier Viknes, who recommended an excellent wine to complement our food! Will be back here again
4
My Wife and I had a very enjoyable lunch . It was our first time there. The service staff Matt , from Poland was very passionate in his introduction and recommendations. His excellent service and our conversation with him made our visit even more memorable! Thank you Matt. Will definitely come by again
5
My first experience at LaBrezza (St Regis) with my fiancee and we couldn't fault it if we tried. We opted for the set menu with the prosecco included. Exceptional service from Matt, Jason and Janine. It always makes an impression when the chef comes to your table to chat about your meal and take an interest in his restaurant guests.... thank you Armando and kitchen team for a 5 star Italian lunch over the weekend! We look forward to returning in the future
5
I had a wonderful experience at LaBrezza! The food prepared by Chef Armando and Chef Simone were simply impressive. The black truffle tagliolini was prepared with perfection- a mouthful of flavours! Matt the restaurant manager was extremely knowledgeable, professional and welcoming. Although I was a single diner, the staff and the ambiance of the restaurant made me feel cozy throughout the experience. I will most definitely come visit again for Chef Armando's cuisine
4
Having BBQ buffet, the seafood and beef are great, chicken wing and sausage is disappointed. Dessert is good too. The place is a bit small but the service is very good
5
Enjoyable experience and good food and ambience but stay away from the oysters they are killers!The remainder of the food was very well prepared and tasty. The deserts were amazing. Next time will have only desert!!Our waiter, Jason, gace very good friendly service
5
My family and I have visited LaBrezza several times for dinner. However, we have never tried their BBQ dinner buffet on Friday nights and last week, on 23 June, we decided to give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised by what we experienced. Though the spread may not be as wide as some other restaurants, the quality of food, from the chilled sea food to salad, cold cuts/cheese board, main and desert, were good. In addition, the seafood were really fresh and the grills were very well done by Chef Armando. We opted for dinner with free flow of wine and really had a great time. In addition, the service was great especially from a staff by the name of Jason, who was very attentive, professional and has good knowledge of their products. Look forward to going back again soon
5
Amazing food..super super delicious..special thanks to Matt for the excellent service and kindness.....Highly recommended for people who fancy italian foo
5
It has always been a pleasure dining @ LaBrezza as the food is consistently good. But since Chef Almando who came to helm the kitchen since January 2017 has certainly brought it to higher standard and better in presentation. Chef Almando's "reconstructed" tiramisu is one of its kind in Singapore which I would highly recommend.The new LaBrezza Restaurant Manager (Matt) who started a week ago, is perfect for the job as he has an approachable and friendly/smiling demeanor and he is pro-active and knowledgeable.PS : Attached photo of the Chianina Beef (= Bistecca alla Fiorentina) which was excellent as it was succulent, very well seasoned & done to our perfection (medium rare). Also attach photo of Deconstructed Tiramis
5
I had a dinner in this beautiful restaurant and I'm happy that I did. The food is beyond amazing especially the spaghetti vongole (must try!). The service is impeccable, thanks to Janine and Matt for looking after me. I want to try their bbq night on fridays too so I will definitely come back soon

My wife and I visited LaBrezza for a dinner on a Saturday evening to see if we could experience à la carte gastronomic delights as said on the restaurant's web page. With exceptional food on our mind and LaBrezza being part of the 5 star hotel St Regis our expectations, have to be said, were very high.The first impression stepping out from the elevator on the 2nd floor and walking the few steps to the restaurant felt more like going to a gym or spa than a 5 star restaurant. The entrance is not the most exciting leading out to the pool area. LaBrezza is a small restauarant with a nice decor and atmosphere. We got a table close to the door and next to the window. My wife had a good view looking in towards the restaurant and out at the pool but I was looking out the door into he hallway. By facing that way I saw all the hotel guests pass by in bathrobes and slippers and also looking at the towel stack. Maybe not always a 5 star view.For starters we ordered the "Duck Breast, Apple Compote, Rosemary Gastrique" and the "Tuna Tartare, Potato, French Bean, Quail Egg". The Duck was really a gastronomic delight but the Tuna was not. The Tuna was fresh but really nothing else, just fresh Tuna with some vegetables, egg and lemon juice squeezed on top. This you could get anywhere, just buy the ingredients. For the Tuna to be gastronomic or even more than just fresh some more inventions must be done to bring it to another level. The bread basket that was served was really good, as was the white wine we ordered. For the main course we both ordered the "Angus Beef Striploin, Pizzaiola Sauce, Green Peppers". The beef was tender, tasty and prepared very well, mine medium rare and my wife's medium, and this showed some good skills. I am not so sure about the sauce and the peppers (green chilies or peppers could not tell) if these really added something to be bring the dish to a gastronomic level. The sauce and peppers were okay but somewhat blend and dull in flavor. The presentation with sauce and peppers dollops spread out on the plate around the stake was not the most delightful to look at. With the main course we ordered a red wine - year 2012 on the wine list and recommended by the waitress. However, after the tasting we both felt that this wine is not what we like. We changed to another wine but happened to notice from the label that the year 2012 bottle we were offered was actually from 2013 and not from year 2012. I don't know if 2013 was not as a good year as 2012 or if there was a printing error on the wine list but in a 5 star restaurant this should not happen. The other red wine we ordered was good.For dessert we ordered "Caramelised Apple, Almond Crumble,Vanilla Ice Cream, Cinnamon Powder" and "Mascarpone Mousse, Lady Finger Biscuit,Coffee-Bailey’s Syrup". The Apple dessert was really good but then again the Mascarpone Mousse was not. The Mascarpone mousse was actually a de-constructed Tiramisu cake. I don't think this was the right dish to de-construct and at least not in the way t was done. The Tiramisu should be moist, fluffy mascarpone from the incorporated egg whites with some sweetness, coffee and liquor impregnated ladyfingers. This I think would be best achieved by letting the whole "cake" infuse overnight. Now the de-constructed "Tiramisu" was very dry, somewhat bitter and with a very compact Mascarpone mousse. There was nothing to bring the dessert together.The service and staff was really pleasant and 5 star.Overall an okay experience and evening, but not living up to the gastronomic delights of what would be expected in a real 5 star hotel.
5
I visited La Brezza for a quick lunch because I was dying for pizza. I was ready to have an average one as any other pizzas in Singapore (Lucky me, I am used to Neapolitan DOP Pizza made in Naples...) but it end up to be The Pizza! Lovely taste and texture, served by a DOP Neapolitan chef! Chef Armando was so nice to give me a complimentary small taste of his Parmigiana di Melanzane, which was delicious! Very attentive service provided by the new Restaurant Manager Matt and his team, and nice atmosphere. I look forward to come back again for a proper dinner to taste Chef Armando creations.
5
My husband and I had our dinner at LaBrezza and we tried the degustation menu by Chef Armando. The food was impeccable and every dish was thoughtfully crafted. The restaurant manager, Matt, was attentive and friendly. We had a great experience and would come back again
5
I stayed at the St. Regis and went to the labrezza for desserts and wine, the manager Matt was very nice and treated me very well. He made me feel like he really cared and made sure all my needs were met. The staff at the hotel were all very courteous. I will definitely be coming back again.
5
food was amazing. we went for 5-7pm happy hour. we are vegetarian so no options. staff, however, makes amazing items for us and we had a wonderful time. matt p and colleagues really were the best
4
We really enjoyed our Fathers Day brunch here yesterday. Having been in Singapore for 19 years we have done many of the brunches but LaBrezza was different as quiet and intimate.Good food selection, especially the seafood station. Plenty of antipasta and then the chance to choose mains, after some excellent gnocchi and risotto. Good desserts and cheese options.We were well looked after by Matt, the new restaurant manager, and his team.Reasonably priced as brunches go. Would have preferred an Italian wine selection to Chilean
5
Had a pleasant poolside dinner of the strip steak. Service was wonderful as I was tended to by Matt the new manager. Very friendly! Being used to US steakhouses, the strip steak was a bit small but saved room for the Tiramisu aka Savolardi Marscapone e Caffe.
5
I made a ton of pictures for Instagram and Tumblr and Facebook. And the Manager Matt is so nice. If you wanted to celebrate anything come here. And Matt told us that on Friday they have a BBQ Night. So you should come (and it only happened once a week) And they have a pool and the experience was awesome. Celin
5
Had dinner with friends and straight away not waste time to order for the barbeque its really mouth watering, the sea food display makes you keep coming back and back again!!we really enjoyed it!! cant wait to come back again!!!
5
Had a really awesome meal here. The new chief is from Italy and cooked up a really authentic lobster dish. I didn't have any wine but the menu and choices are great. I hope to come back again next time I stay here.
4
Had dinner mid-week for 3. We all took the degustation menu. Nice varied choice of dishes across lobster, smoked duck, risotto with scallop, pasta, and beef all crafted beautifully- plus a bit of theatre thrown in when serving the deconstructed tiramisu for good measure. Concise wine list, but the quality was very good. Not an overly busy evening, but that was nice. Waiters relaxed but attentive, formal but engaging
5
Celebrated on Mother's Day with my wife and daughter at this restaurant and was greeted with a thoughtful menu by Chef Armando Aristarco. They have a wide spread of fresh seafood and dessert counters too for Sunday brunch. We enjoyed the food very much and definitely we will be back again soon. Highly recommended if you are looking for a quiet cosy restaurant with great food and service
5
A taste of Italiano delice that caters to the taste of the finest!The desserts range have room for expansion and that will be perfect
5
Celebrated a good friend's birthday at Le Breeza. The food was absolutely amazing. Great recommendation from Chef Armando. Definitely will go back again.
5
thank you Chef Armando for the great evening, me and my guest enjoy very much on the food and the service provided. the environment was relaxing and all the food comes accordingly
4
The 3-course business lunch is perfect for meeting friends or clients. The setting is quiet enough for conversation despite being reasonably full at lunch. Although the new chef is from Napoli, they have kept the trofie pasta from Genoa. It's the only place I know of in Singapore where you can get this pasta served with pesto sauce. For those who do not like pesto sauce, you probably have not taken good Genoan pesto. That's where pesto came from. Lamb shank was well made. Dessert was predictable well presented and formulated - I had the Casseta. Service was excellent. My only complaint (and that applies to many high-end restaurants in Singapore) is that the coffee is not up to standard - they should get the chef to taste the coffee and tell them why it's not the same as what you get in Italy. Yes, most Italian restaurants in Singapore do not pay enough attention to the coffee they serve, unlike in Italy
4
My family and I went back to the restaurant last Saturday, 8 April 2017. Our first time at the restaurant was sometime last year and we did not have a very good experience both in terms of the service and the food quality. However, we decided to give it another try and to our surprise, we had a much better experience this time round. Much of the improvement came from the change in chef. New Chef Armando's menu is not only tastier but also a lot more pleasing to the eyes. We also like the fact that Chef Armando went round to engage all the guests. We could feel his passion and sincerity in coming up with the menu. Another imrpovement is that, the sliding glass door is now fully opened up and it provides a much better ambience for pool side dinning. Finally, we also find a much improved service level from the service crew. Will definitely make a return visit to LaBreeza
4
A good set lunch deal, esp if you have the American express platinum card, which has a 1-for-1 offer. The selection available was also not bad, with choices like seafood and lamb. The seafood is fresh, however, it was a bit too simple and nothing exciting. Still a good choice given the good service, atmosphere and price
5
I had the chance to enjoy a dinner at La Brezza. Real Italian tradition in an elegant international setting. Bravo to the CHEF! A must try in Singapore
5
I came to Labrezza on a spontaneous visit with my husband on our first evening in Singapore. It was love at the first sight! Very relaxing atmosphere with an extended to outside dining area, cozy furniture and soft music at the background. We ordered burrata with lobster, pekin duck, cod fish, which tasted divine, and the most Wow dish was risotto with sea lettuce, scallop and caviar, no salt, no butter, no cream! Highly recommended to all food lovers and visitors in Singapore! Thank you chef and team for absolutely amazing experience, we will be back
5
You will just keep eating and eating and eating, and forget about your diet/weight plans.Chef Armando is definitely cooking up a storm in this nice cosy restaurant. We took the degustation menu during lunch and had a feast far exceeding our expectations (not to mention far exceeding my controlled calorie intake for that day). The first course was Boston Lobster salad with generous pieces of Boston lobster. The smoked duck breast was so flavourful and tender. The risotto was nicely done which blended well with the slides of scallops and caviar. The tender pieces of pork ragout on paccheri was unique and memorable (it was my first time eating paccheri... which seemed to be similar to stracci but in a tube shape). The beef striploin was done just right and the portion was substantial even for a large size person like me. The tiramisu was prepared right in front of you and the taste was out of world.... (am hungry again as I am writing this review).Chef Armando told us that he have only been here for 3 months and his hometown was Napoli. Armando offered us some nice Nipoli pastries too.. The only thing I knew about Napoli was Diego Maradona... :) then I realised that I have always been ONLY to north of Rome (Milano, Firenze, Pisa, Venice etc) and never ventured anywhere south of Rome. Maybe next time I will make time for the other half of Italy.If Chef Armando continues to maintain this high standard of cooking... it may even knock some of those less worthy Michelin starred restaurants off the list in the up-coming editions of the Michelin Guide.One side note however was that I did a reservation online and got a confirmation email, but when I arrived, my reservation could not be found....this is not acceptable for a nice fine-dining establishment... some backoffice improvement is needed over here

It was my first visit at Labrezza. Everything was awesome! Ambience,service and food was amazing! Special thanks for Pramila's great service.

Fine dining for two. Indoor seating has nicer ambience than the outdoor tables. Large, comfortable chairs indoors to dine with. Suitable for romantic couple dining

My husband and I had a most wonderful dining experience recently at LaBrezza. It was our first visit there but certainly it would not be the last. That evening, we ordered the 'Degustation Experience' priced at $128 ++ per pax. It was a wonderful choice as we enjoyed every dish on the menu. The starter 'Astice Burrata E Panzanella' was a delectable serving of boston lobster with burrata cheese. The deep sea flavour of the lobster was evident without being overpowering and it tasted so good compared to some of the bland lobster appetisers we have tried at other fine restaurants. Next, was 'Anatra Mela E Rosmarino' - sliced duck breast that was very tender and went so well with the apple compote. To me, the highlight was the next dish 'Risotto Lattuga Di Mare' as the risotto was cooked with the extract of deep sea lettuce and topped with a slice of Hokkaido scallop. I generally do not like risotto but the taste of this risotto was really divine with a lot of flavour from the sea lettuce and no salt needed to be added according to Chief Chef Armando. The first main dish was the pork collar ragout and Chef Armando offerred us 2 choices of pacheri and home made pasta so that we can try both types of pasta. I much prefer the home made pasta as the pacheri was a tad too al dente (Armando said the Italians like their pasta al dente). The second main was a beef dish 'Manzo Pomodoro Capperie Olive'. I personally found it tough even though I wanted it medium - think it could be due to the fact it's a striploin and not ribeye. Anyway, I have never been a beef person so that dish did not appeal to me. Finally, it was dessert and it was tiramisu and a really wonderfully well done tiramisu. I have only enjoyed this dessert at another restaurant 'Porta Porta'. The tiramisu at LaBrezza was not overly sweet and a perfect blend of the coffee syrup, mousse and biscuit. Coffee or tea is also part of the menu and the choices are not limited to fresh brew. My husband tried the capuchinno and he loved it. The menu changes monthly (I think) but this menu has just been launched and should be around for a while. The service at the restaurant is top notch. We wanted to get some pastries from the cafe and the restaurant manager accompanied us all the way to the cafe and told us to continue with our dinner and she delivered our purchase of pastries to us personally. Very attentive service and the chef Armando enjoys mingling with the diners - we certainly enjoyed talking to Armando. The restaurant ambience is great for private dinners as it's spacious. We spent almost 3 hours at the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.We promised Armando we will be back and we certainly will

After attending an event at the St Regis we were looking for a place to eat in the afternoon. We were not disappointed.Friendly service, authentic Italian cuisine. We tried the chef's take on the Melanzana which was fantastic - fun, incredibly tasty. Pizza which was available on request was delicious. I guess the restaurant is often overlooked as he hotel's all day dining venue, however the food is definitely worth a detour.

My girlfriend and i were invited to a 5-course dinner in LaBrezza, St. Regis hotel. So we came by on the 27th February. As mentioned on the title, the expectation for a casual fine dining was not as pleasant as we thought.(When we were at the reception, they couldn't find our reservation. They explained that they had technical malfunction regarding the date with Chope. Being understanding, we were fine with it. However, the bad experience continues.(Environment) As we stepped in, reserved tables were poorly set up. Some without folded napkin, a table without proper cutleries setting.(Service) I will say the service team does not pay good attention on guests. For instance, it took the service team about 20mins to refill our iced water. Food is not explained to us at all. (Food) The food came very late, an appetizer with the portion of a fine dining took them 30mins to be served. From starters to main course is cold and tasteless. Nothing impressive.(Value) By comparing with the quality of food and beverage menus against the price which they set, i find it overpriced.(Overall) I would not say the experience is so terrible, but i would probably say that LaBrezza have to work on their overall service and food. Make improvement for the better
4
New menu next month. Can't wait. So far la brezza has not disappoint. A little pricey though. But still worth it
5
I was there with my wife and a couple of friends.It was a nice experience. The Italian chef Armando was very friendly and talented, preparing for us a delicious dinning menu. Also Karine Colesse prepared delicious entry options and deserts.Thanks Armando and Karine for being so kind. Your hospitality testify a true focus on customers.We are planning to return in March to try the upcoming new menu
3
Our minestrone soup was not the traditional one and lacked salt. Our pasta was over salted and they made us wait too long for the bread. We were starving. Staff was friendly and tried hard to help but they were slow. Overall average
2
The setting as well as the food is a disappointment, overlooks the pool and extremely expensive, if staying at st regis and just landed and tired? Then try it
1
When I called up to reserve a table, being a SPG member, I was told that I would enjoy the SPG discount. But when asked for the payment, I was told that because it is festive period, there is no discount. Why was I told I could enjoy the discount when I called to book the table? And I was also not told that the menu will be different from the usual one. Would not go back again and not recommend this place
2
We were the only table there before 2pm and waited until about 3pm for food to arrive. Steak we ordered was rare to medium rare while we ordered medium. Cooks were unprofessional as I could hear and see 4 cooks talking rowdily and having a grand old time while cooking and not caring about cooking at all while I went to the washroom. Won't not recommend nor come back.
1
Pizza base was slightly raw, could have done more time in the oven. There was more dough than toppings. Orecchiette was missing the brown anchovies that was meant to be one of the highlights. Service was good but food was disappointing indeed
1
We originally booked for Brasserie Les Saveurs at St. Regis for lunch for a special occasion. However, we were mistakenly confirmed that the seats were available by their staff. Later we were told that was actually fully committed for a private event until we double confirmed with another staff one day before our booking. We tried to find an alternative nearby in last min, but most of the hotel restaurants had been fully booked. So we decided to give LaBrezza a try. At last, we were very disappointed. We ordered two set lunch - lamb rack and sea bass. The restaurant was not packed but the service was quite slow. We were starving but still had to wait for almost 20-25 mins for the breads/bakery. The soup was too salty and appetizers were average. We waited for another 15-20mins for our main courses after finishing the soup and appetizers. To our disappointment, both lamb racks and sea bass were over-cooked. Lamb racks were tough. Sea bass looked stale and only half size of a mist. Side dish potatoes were all soggy. No dressing on salad. Lamb and fish looked like recooked from other people left over. The presentation was bad. My wife only finished half of her dish. When we gave feedback to one of the staff, he offered us an exchange for spaghetti, but we didn't take it as it could be another long wait for poor quality of food...Would not recommend
2
This is my second time dining at La Brezza.My friend and I went for lunch. We ordered the Business Lunch set. The starter which was calamari, prawn with asparagus was fresh. Mussel soup was ok despite it being a bit saltish. Our main course was lamb rack and we're looking forward to it. Unfortunately, it came overcooked and stale. Like it was some leftover food. My friend took one slice and left the rest untouched. I asked for a new plate for myself. The new plate of lamb rack tasted fresh and succulent. My point here is are we taken for a ride? We used the Amex card promotion. Is the restaurant trying to pass on this stale food to some unaware customers? To make matters worst, the Maitre D did not even come by to enquire.
2
Ambience was decent. 7/10Service level 9/10 awesome serviceQuality of food 2/10 The best thing about this place is the ambience and the service! If it's for coffee and tea it's ok. If lunch or dinner, not recommended. Food rating Pasta : 2/10. Disappointing because it doesn't taste good and I think it's a poor combination of everything on the plate. Hawaiian Pizza : 2/10. Pizza Hut is better than this. The crust is hard to cut, the pineapple is little, the whole dish is not good. Cod fish ($36) 5/10. The cod fish is fresh, the yellow mash up thing at the side is tasteless (like Cous Cous) but it's not Cous Cous. The veg is roasted and not flavoured so you can guess how it taste. The mash up cod fish at the side is not bad though.

We went to LaBrezza for Christmas Lunch because it is a St Regis restaurant (so it should have good standards) and we live across the road.We had a reservation so we were shown to our table. The staff said "enjoy your buffet" and left. So we went to check out the spread. There were three main sections: 1) Lobsters and oysters2) Salad bar3) Dessert and cheese tableTried a few lobsters and they were definitely not fresh, in fact, they reeked of a stench. So table 1'a off our list.The second table had greens, it was ok, it was vege, and we had a lot of it because that was all that was available. Then, seeing that we could not be consuming the lobsters, we had dessert from table 3.After we were full, a staff approached us and said "are you ready to order your main course?" We were not pleased but proceeded to order. Main courses for the two of us were ok. Not great, not bad, but not St Regis.Then I asked for the bill, at which point a female staff told us that we should order our dessert. And so we did.Then, a guy in suit came and told us the desserts were all on the dessert table. Fantastic right?The crew clearly did not get briefed on what was the menu of the day. They did not inform us what to expect, because, who could blame them, only one guy actually knew.Service was ok if this was not St Regis but unfortunately, this was. Staff was very inattentive and needless to say, this whole thing was a waste of money.We left a little hungry and very disappointed. Although it is across the road from our place, we are definitely not going back.Avoid if you can

I am vegetarian and my mum like steak. Despite we are small eater (as we only order 2 main course), their service is still very good. My vegetarian pasta is very good, rib eye steak just nice for my mem. Good ambience, good food, good service.
4
We ordered the three course business set lunch. I had the for starter, buratta salad, for main, grilled seabass prawn and calamari and dessert, cassata siciliana. We were served a basket of warm bread. My friend had the Prawn, octopus and mussel salad. The portion was large and tasted fresh. All the seafood was cooked very well. The pistachio ice cream in dessert was delicious. Tea or coffee was included in the set. We used the Amex platinum card and got 50% off. Except for being a bit slow on serving the main, the staff was friendly and attentive
5
We ate dinner at LaBrezza after a disappointing experience in another restaurant at St. Regis Hotel. Service was attentive and food was delicious. We ate indoors as the poolside area seemed too humid and hot. Food is definitely upscale Italian, no spaghetti bolognese, but authentic and well prepared
4
My first time here and it was an enjoyable experience. The meal started off excellently with the cold cuts and selection of Italian cheeses. My better half had the minestrone thereafter and it was also very good. The mains came with their signature pasta and a bone marrow risotto. They were good but didn't scale the heights of what went on before. Desserts weren't a big deal either. Overall though it was a good night and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again
2
Not sure what to say other than disappointed. We waited over 30 mins for a cold cuts starter.... and none of the staff bothered to explain. The maitradee offered us a bottle of sparking water to compensate only for the main course to also take 30 mins to arrive. Food was OK, but the serviced ruined the experience.... wasn't even busy. Won't be back.
4
They really want you to take your time, the food was worth the wait but don't come here if you are on a tight schedul
3
Ok food with excellent service in beautiful setting. Surprisingly good value especially considering locatio
5
We tried LaBrezza for Restaurant Week. It was a great choice for a 4 course dinner. Every dish was immaculately prepared, like works of art in fine dining portions. The antipasti of salmon, scallop and Sicilian red prawn looked like fine Japanese sashimi. The pasta with seared lobster/tiger prawn wrapped in pork Gunciale was deliciousKudos to Jason, the ever-attentive and thoughtful wait staff who suggested the wonderful tirasmisu for dessert. St Regis Singapore is very fortunate to have such excellent staff
4
This was a nice relaxed area by the pool or a cosy room inside. The food was wonderful as you would expect

LeBrezza definitely had the best restaurant service we ever experienced! Service Review The service staff who received us was very patient and did an excellent job translating the various dishes on the degustation menu in Mandarin for my mandarin speaking guest.Another staff also noticed that we had difficulty finishing a dish and was quick to ask us if there was an issue with the dish. What was impressive was that we weren't even complaining about it. He just read our body language and probe us about it. The kitchen then promptly replaced the dish with another. The was also another staff that read the body language of my guest and approached her before she could ask him to request for tea. We were indeed impressed with the professionalism of the staff in this restaurant. We have yet to encounter such level of service in Singapore. Food ReviewHad a 7 course degustation menu with a stuzzichino (appetizer). You can visit their website for the menu. Servings were really huge and we were full half way! e.g. expected the ravioli dish to be a tasting portion of about 4-5 pieces, but there were easily 8-10 pieces. Would recommend to go for 5 course instead. Choose between the ravioli or the tagiatelle. Totally skip the grilled octopus with white beans. We didn't really get the dish. Maybe it was just not suited for us. Grilled octopus was really tough and was just presented on a plate of whole white beans. It seemed a bit out of place compared with the rest of the beautifully presented dishes. This was the dish that was replaced with a pan-seared tuna dish that was really really really beautiful and yummy!Overall, most of the dishes were really delicious. But would really recommend just taking the 5-course
5
La Brezza is a great fine dining restaurant with a very skilled Italian chef. I tried the tasting menu and was served 6 different Italian dishes by Paul and his team. Great service and delicious food. The open kitchen concept is great and you can see how passionate the chefs are preparing your food. Lobsters come fresh from a aquarium. The restaurant is small and always packed so a reservation is a must I guess. Also a great place for lunch and always full as I was around. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining. The outdoor dining next around the pool and green bushes is very nice

We are currently staying at this amazing hotel St Regis on our honeymoon, after a fun packed day we headed to the pool to chill and decided to have a bite to eat, wow it was truly delicious whilst sat in the sun relaxing and the staff are so nice and attentiv
1
The food in this restaurant is not on par with any 5 star hotel in Singapore. The pasta tasted soggy and as though i was eating noodle with soup. Paid $10 to add a chicken breast into the pesto and they added 10 rock solid cube sized pieces of chicken. We had ordered a pizza as well and the crust was so hard you could break a jaw.Asked for normal water and restaurant brought a bottle of mineral still water and poured it into the glasses. Good thing they wavied it. Came as part of an amex promo and still at that price it was not worth it. I felt that i was eating food from a local coffee shop.We were the only ones dinning at 7.30 pm on a Monday night and i finally know the reason why. Sorry La Brezza you need to improve much to be part of the St Regi

We came to lunch for celebrating our wedding anniversary and we ordered several dishes. We 'd never came but believed in the brand of St. Regis - that's how the nightmare started.The staff asked for the feedback on the lobster pasta ordered and we commented the sauce was too salty and the pasta wad overcooked. The staff offered to redo the pasta and we accepted.Few minutes later, the staff brought the pasta which was the same pasta, and completely overlooked this time, with same sauce. The chef was reluctant to prepare the pasta again and left the kitchen afterwards. We were forced to leave the restaurant without finishing our lunch, and not having any dessert and obviously the kitchen was very unfriendly to serve any more food.The restaurant manager only made verbal apologies and hope we can come again. We felt disgusting on how this restaurant treated their guests
2
We have been at la Brezza this evening for a BBQ Dinner, The waiter was very helpful and we have been very nicely greeted and welcomed.The spread of starter were very tasty and fresh.There comes the down side of the evening, bread was brought to our table and found some random seeds inside that almost broke my teeth , happens!!While we had feedback the Maitre D, he told us that it musts be a nuts.... with no apologies or anything else.Then the BBQ was brought to our table " nicely touch from the waiter" unfortunately all the meet was overcook and taste less, followed by the seafood and fish from the BBQ too,we hoped that this will be better, but we fall under again dry and cold!!Dessert were nice but not amazing enough for us to forgive the rest of the night.Overall the place is great the service team is very attentive and service orientated, cold food is great, BBQ which should be the hit of the night lacking of skills.I would suggest that the management should have more training and empathy to handle such situation.Hope this review will help the place to improve as they really have a great location
4
I was on my own and the scale of this place seemed right for solo dining as it is small. It overlooks the pool and has efficient welcoming staff and the food is excellent. The wine list is very large with a good selection of Italian wines. I just had wine by the glass. One word of warning though the small serves of pasta are very generous if I tried to finish my starter I would not have had room for my main course
3
It is sad that in a good quality hotel you can only get average Italian like this. The room and atmosphere is very plain and all up a waste of money. If it was cheap youd feel ok, but not at these prices
4
Situated by the pool at the St Regis so ambience is great. I had the cold celeriac soup with crab quenelle which was absolutely delicious. Husband had the mussels which he felt could have done with some chilli. However for the main we ordered the regular size signature dish of lobster pasta to share and I'm so glad we did. The dish included a whole lobster as well as the tomato based bisque type sauce for the pasta. The meal was very very tasty but a half share was even more than I could eat. Service was good and the staff very pleasant to deal with. All in all a great meal
3
âˆšWithout a doubt, ambience and service are definitely one of the best I've experienced in Singapore. Food however was quite disappointing. We had a great start; the appetiser was good! Sadly it went downhill from there. The squid ink pasta was rather bland and the salmon was overcooked. Desserts wise, my significant other enjoyed it very much while I didn't find the dry flaky texture of the cheesecake palatable. I suppose I still prefer the old fashioned smooth and creamy cheesecake haha. Overall, my experience was pleasant, mostly thanks to the service provided
3
It's in a nice location overlooking the St Regis Hotel pool. However the food and service were at best, average. Spaghetti with red prawns was tasty, as was the grilled prime rib. But the turbot fillet was somewhat dry.
5
Lovely to eat poolside, altho could eat inside. Wide variety of buffet for breakfast, but I enjoyed the chef made omelett
4
We dined here with friends for dinner on a week night. The food we ate was very good. One of our party knew the chefs well so we were well provided for. The mushroom soup was very good and served, as seems to be fashionable these days, in a screw top jar. The spaghetti with lobster was very tasty indeed. For our main course we enjoyed a dish of tenderloin steak and beef cheek, it was delicious and cooked to perfection. A chocolate desert with mango was very good but we were all getting full by then. The restaurant is a level 2 next to the swimming pool. It can't quite decide if it is fine dining or a more family location. The night we were there it was not enormously busy. It was a wet night so it was not possible to open it up to the swimming pool patio. There would be a higher number of diners if they removed the crisp white table cloths and specialised on pizza, pasta, fish and meat. In its current format it just misses a lot of potential business
4
What a lovely atmosphere right next to the hotel pool (although I wonder what it might had been like had some noisy guests occupied the pool).Now about the food... The starter octopi were tough. When we commented to the waiter about it, he reported it and very kindly the chef came out to explain that it was the octopi that were being sourced and not the cooking (so I'm not quite sure why it was served if he was unhappy with it). They agreed to take it off the bill.My friend's Linguine with clams was a little too al dente for my tastes, but my friend loved it. My Trofie with pesto was perfectly cooked and lovely, but hardly blew me away.Overall a lovely evening with great service, but sadly the food was not the highlight
1
As mentioned above, this is only about the restaurant and should perhaps not overly reflect on the overall quality of the hotel (I have not stayed there). The restaurant was possibly the worst dining experience I have had in 5 years in Singapore. Staff were friendly but mostly came across as unchanged. Main problem was the time it took for food to arrive. 35 mins for a cold platter to share between 4 (we had to chase on numerous occasions) and then a further 30 mins after that was finished with for two cold salads, a pizza and a plate of ravioli. All this in a restaurant that had only 4 tables needing to be served. It all tasted distinctly average by the time it did arrive. They did at the end acknowledge the service was unacceptable and knocked something off the bill so we can thank them for that at least but I suggest people avoid at all costs

Had our NYE dinner celebration at LaBrezza last night, what a big MISTAKE. We should have known better when the even employees at St. Regis warned us the restaurant isn't good. Unfortunately all the restaurants they recommended were already fully booked.The waiter kept on rushing us to order. No explanation about the menu, no specials, no anything but... "What do you want to order"... So we placed an appetizer order first, and he kept on insisting on the dinner order.... We asked to wait until our appetizers came. His wait time is 5 minutes, and back to our table "What do you want to order". The restaurant was not busy at all, 4 tables at the most. Appetizers were so so. Nothing to Yelp, nothing to boast about on TripAdvisor or post on Facebook or Instagram. Dinner on the other hand was not so so.... It was actually TERRIBLE. The table ordered the Chef's Special - Papadelli Pasta w/ Lobster and the Foie Gras dish. The pasta had a strange marinara sauce, and the Foie Gras was over cooked and tasted awful. We're big foodies, have dined at French Laundry, Gary Danko's, and various James Beard, Relais & Chateau, Michelin Star restaurants... So we know pasta and we definately know Foie Gras. When we communicated our disappointed, the staff rushed us out. Wow we left in disbelief. Our NYE dinner ruined

Thank you for a wonderful time, the food was superb! Me and my sister had a beautiful deserts. We enjoy every moment with great services, thanks Yogga!
5
The food is excellent, on the pricey side, but excellent. The Italian chef is wonderful and the food has a lot of northern italian influences.
4
Had an excellent Sunday Brunch. The food and drinks variety were great. Portions and taste were just nice, Service by the staffs was excellent, always had a smile
2
First of all, apologies for the poor quality photos....lightning wasn't exactly in my favor. I am a pasta lover, it's part of meal at least 4-5 times a week...that's why when we planned this visit, I was super excited...trying different kinds of pastas with different flavors..that's like a dream come true to me. You'd be served in 2 courses, choose 4 pasta out of 6 per person, u'd be served 2 pasta each time. It's true that the more you expect, the harder you fall. I was utterly disappointed with the pasta....they were not cooked al dente, definitely towards the hard side. The clam pasta was very fishy...I was taken aback. I've eaten my share of pasta and this is not what I expect from a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. We gave our feedback the first round before the staff serve us the second course. The pastas arrived and it's the one I was looking forward to-the one with the lobster (yes always the one with the lobster). Pasta was still not al dente but slightly softer than before, but the fishy taste was even stronger for this one! I am not sure if it was the stock or the seafood (the lobster actually taste fine), but this is one I can't put in my mouth, unfortunately. The best I had in this meal was the duck ragout and pan seared duck foie gras pasta...ignoring the hardness of the penne, the flavor is not bad. Such an impressive menu, but what a disappointmen
5
It was a lousy day for me but getting out of my room roaming to the second floor getting to the property at the second floor, what it has to offer. I met your wonderful team, took me to visit the spa / sauna and then, the evening cocktail facing the pool. I can tell you the wonderful service from Saket and Raymond (I think), gave me the wonderful experience to be home. Being an Elite member, from the check in which was not well recognised did turn me off a bit as I don't question! Reason being an Elite member is least I care when I stay in a home away from home. But I felt great here at the second floor. Cheers!!!

I am a big fan of the St. Regis Hotel and enjoy the Yan Ting and the breakfast in the Brasserie. I am very disappointed that they continue with LaBrezza as one of the major restaurants. The food is adequate at best but by no means could be considered an "Italian" restaurant. Tonight, I had the parma/mozzarella pizza, 2 glasses of wine and bottled water for $120 without tip. I would have gladly shelled out the money if the food had been "more than" adequate, but it wasn't. The pizza had no real taste. I watched two businessmen at an adjacent table send back their entrees (pasta) and when offered a new choice decline. It's truly pathetic. The St. Regis needs to rethink what they want to offer their business travelers looking for a good dinner option. Otherwise, they will all be trotting over to the Regent Basilico or La Forketta across the street
5
We enjoyed breakfast at LaBrezza for seven mornings, and the food and service were impeccable. Darmen, Jasmeen, and Soket along with the chefs gave us a perfect start every day for exploring Singapore. Thank you
5
The Restaurant is at the second floor of the St Regis hotel just in front of the swimming pool.Besides a great location and excellent service the food we had was really spectacular both the scallops and crab appetizer and the tagliolini with lobster
5
I had the lobster pasta and it was yummy. The ambiance was wonderful with lovely service. We enjoyed a delicious Chianti Classico and finished with a splendid pizza that was a big hit with my colleagues. Highly recommend
5
 I dined at labrezza last few days. The food was very good. The staff is friendly and nice i think her name is Zarina. She's very adorable and sweet . She gave what we need. She entertained us by asking how was our day , how was the food? Shes very excellent . I would recommend labrezza to my friends. What I paid is all worth it. Thanks for good experience. Will come back soon and look for Zarina to assist us. More power!
5
tonight we had a wonderful dinner at La Brezza. Zarina was wonderful and made us feel right at home. she was kind and helpful and added to the great food we enjoyed.we highly recommend this restaurant and her service
4
Visited for a business lunch - the set menu was reasonably priced for this category of restaurant -but lacked a chicken or poultry option.The salads were good but not great - the steak as the main was not bad but I would not call it a great cut - however the porcini rub and sauce reduction was superb.The dessert was just ok.Overall the food was good but not inspiring ! I would depend on LaBrezza for a good business lunch anyday but unless I see a real spark in the kitchen I may not return for Dinner
2
Unfortunately the service has been one of the worst in Singapore, mainly because staff was very young and unprepared: had asked at least 5 times to repeat the order, came back with the wrong drink, and another time to inform that the plate I ordered was no longer offered. If it was not for the nice ambience I would have left.Quality of food averag
3
Is best choice in st. Regis but overall dont recommend+salads are ok but boring. Dressing and even the oil are not spectacular -- why not? Hire a great cheff please and have high end ingredients+cod small portion and falling apart, comes with a big piece of like mashed potato on bottom -- not refined, poor finish+champagne not at the right temperature -- hotter than it shouldSt. regis -- hire an excellent chef pleas
5
Fabulous lunch at LaBrezza. A bit expensive, but what can one expect when ordering off the seasonal Black Truffles menu?! Delicious food, lovely presentation and very friendly staff. Truly one of the somewhat undiscovered jewels of the Singapore dining scene
5
We celebrated our son's 18th Birthday here, kids love Italian food and so we tried out LaBrezza and it has exceeded our expectation. We opt for the brunch menu and it was a great choice for us all as we love varieties. We enjoyed the great brunch selections and the delicious freshly prepared meal by the chef. The staff are all very friendly, attentive and professional. They really made us feel very special and we received a complimentary birthday cake with candle for out birthday boy. It was an excellent meal with intimate cozy ambience and very attentive professional staff! Well done and we will definitely be back soon

It is so sad when a restaurant makes a great play of using flashy ingredients but then the meal you are served is ruined by the absolute and complete basics. Walking into La Brezza (my first time since the change of chef), I was hoping for a nice relaxing evening of good Italian food so that I could concentrate on enjoying a final meal with a friend who was leaving Singapore later that night for home and Christmas holidays with family.The menu is keen to promote that it uses white truffles on page 1, black truffles on page 2 and no less than live lobster (sitting behind me in a tank) on page 3. But when I looked at the substance of the menu what became startingly obvious was that the menu really lacked a balance of choices for an evening meal. For example, both starters and main courses (even taking into account the pasta main dishes) are incredibly limited in choice. If you do not like red meat of fish, not a single main course would suit you unless you closed your eyes and ate the veal and imagined it was chicken. The wine list was probably one of the most limited and unexciting wine lists I have ever seen in my entire life. For a hotel of this calibre not to be able to offer an impressive array of Italian wines from a country whose wine heritage is amazingly rich and diverse, is absolutely missing the mark!So to the meal....oh dear!So I decided to have the angel hair pasta with scallop and black truffle. Not because I like black truffle or because I like scallops particularly but because I wanted to see how good the pasta was and also to see whether this combination could be made to work. A lone scallop (perfectly cooked if I am being totally fair) came wrapped in bacon sat on top of a nice little pile of angel hair spaghetti with a generous amount of black truffle. There also appeared to be spherical balls of olive oil...nice little touch. But the whole plate was stone cold. I paused thinking that maybe this was how it was supposed to be served but to be honest, if that was the case, then the level of seasoning was wowfully inadequate and the only thing that I really enjoyed at all was the lone scallop.For my second course I asked for the ravioli of kurobuta pork in truffle sauce. Again not because I like truffles but because I love ravioli done well and because the description of the dish was enticing enough to have me interested in trying it. Hmmm...how can one describe this dish when it came out and was presented. Lacklustre, disappointing, downright awful, rubbish...I could go on. Again stone cold (I was tempted to send it back but could not be bothered as it would have created a scene that could so easily have ruined a nice evening with a friend), wowfully underseasoned, tasteless pork, far too much sauce, three little pieces of ravioli (S$10+ each if I remember my maths). Substance over form....oh good God!Now for a last little piece of positive news. Well a negative first. The dessert menu is, to say the least, limited and limited just to headline Italian desserts like Tiramisu, etc. I chose the affogato hoping for something a little light. A proper affogato should be a great way to end a meal. This was a passable and pleasant half way house. Passable quality vanilla gelato (frankly I've had better as this gelato had some crystal chunks of ice in it) and good quality coffee. But why...why...why...did you have to go and dollop loads of horrible whipped cream on top. Frankly I was hungry so ate it.My first and definitely my last visit to this disappointing tourist trap..

had the ocean beach canadian oysters - SO FRESH!!! loved the soy sauce that came with it. seafood in the seafood linguine was very fresh too - linguine on other hand was abit short of al dente. tiramisu was good - not too sweet! i rate it very good for the freshness of the produce. service staff lacked product knowledge and it was clear our waiter must either be quite new at the job or a little scatterbrained. but he seemed nice and tried. i'll give him points for effort. :) tried their famous bloody mary (my first) and it's clear i don't like spicy cocktails. IMO the bora bora mary was too peppery and the girls agreed that the chilli padi mary tasted like chinese herbal tea. but this is subjective so...

At the St. Regis Singapore, the Italian restaurant LaBrezza on the 2nd floor was out of this world. Friendly staff, fabulous service, truly unbelievable food. I've never experienced such marvelous service or such esoteric flavors. This is a hidden gem. Needle in a haystack. OMG!My personal thanks to SD, Stefano, Maharshi and the entire LaBrezza team for the 5 Star gourmet service and personal touch. LaBrezza is beyond 5 Stars!!!If you are in Singapore, EAT AT LA BREZZA. You will never forget the magic they deliver to the senses. Of course, you cannot do better than St. Regis rooms and service overall

The food was very good. The taste is very authentic. Brought back much memories of our time in Italy. The live lobster catch from the aquarium is fantastic cooked with thin pasta and fresh tomato!!!!! The service staff is very attentive. Definitely we will come back soon!!!!

Me and my husband have dined in La Brezza because some friend recommended this restaurant. We have immediately notice the white truffle and we decided to try the set menu.Our favorite was the lasagna perfectly cook and the flavor was amazing with the white truffle.Follow from the beef beautiful presented and very testy for my husband and for me the lobster served with the barley.Thank you to all the staff for the beautiful dinner and for sure we will come back!!!

my point of reference for this Saturday brunch is the Saturday brunch at 190 @ Four Seasons, Singapore - the offering here initially appears to offer better value/be more interesting, but the actual experience is very different - essentially, it is quite a stretch to classify this as authentic Italian cuisineThere is a cold seafood buffet, as well as an antipasti bar - one then order from a menuI ordered a porcini cream soup, a fillet steak and then proceeded to help myself to the antipasti barat the Four Seasons, when I enquired as to whether there was any pork-free cured meats, they promptly prepared a generous serving of bresaola in the kitchen and brought it out for mea similar query from me here just elicited a reply stating that there wasn't - there was no attempt to check with the kitchen whether there was any bresaolathe antipasti presented were not particularly authentic - but the shocker was how the burrata was displayedthere was a large bowl with several pieces of burrata inside which had just been smashed open and put in the bowl - thus, it resembled a bowl of cream with pieces of mozzarella floating around - a great pity as the burrata itself was good qualitywhat was very disappointing was that when I sat down with my antipasti (mixed green salad, burrata, olives and semi dried tomatoes), the soup was immediately placed in front of me, to be followed by the small medallion of beefwhen I commented to the manager that surely the food should have been served to be in the correct order - antipasti, soup, prima piatti etc etc - his reply was "the kitchen is very free now, so the food is ready early"I indicated that this was not how I wanted to have my meal - and he removed the steak, but left the soupSoup - cream of porcini - very creamy, under-seasoned and under-flavouredscrambled eggs with white truffle - appalling: the eggs were very solid, and had obviously been prepared earlier (they had set into a solid mass), and the eggs had been doused very heavily with white truffle oil - there was no subtlety to the dish/flavour at all, and the eggs were like boarding school scrambled eggs - it was very telling that clear liquid had seeped out of the eggs, which indicated that the eggs had been prepared earlier and kept warmmedallion of fillet with béarnaise sauce - two major strikes: 1) the manager hadn't asked me how I liked my steak cooked 2) béarnaise sauce in an Italian restaurant...really?! (steak was medium/well)I then went up to inspect the cheese trolley: none of the waiters knew what the cheese was - one of the them even told me that the Scamorza was "parmesan"!the Italian chef was called out and he identified the cheeses correctly - although I had to qualify the Scamorza by telling him that it was smoked, which he confirmedhe kindly asked me whether I would like some parmaggiano, which I accepted - I also asked him to cook me a dish of linguine al pomodoro, very al dente, which he readily agreed to dothe pasta was indeed very al dente, in fact, perfectly so but the pomodoro sauce lacked any "kick", and I felt that the pasta had been tossed in the sauce off heat, rather than in the pan as the texture wasn't quite rightI had an issue with the "parmaggiano" - it tasted more like grana padano: the rind was very thin, the brininess of aged parmaggiano was totally missing - perhaps it was just a very young parmaggiano?the dolci : good, crispy cannoli, but the pistachio gelato tasted more like standard ice cream - just not gelatothe service was attentive throughou

We had dinner in the La Brezza Italian restaurant. The food was perfect and the ambience, with the full length windows and views out over the pool was terrific – and the dessert bar, a sight to behold with glorious confections and a chocolate fountain
5
Visited La Brezza for a special date. The staff were very attentive and accommodative in attending to us. Enjoyed the overall atmosphere and service. Will visit again.

Food was excellent. Ambiance was nice by the pool. Service rendered was warm and welcoming. Would come back again

My husband and I were introduced to LaBrezza by one of our friends who often tells us about how good their prosecco brunch on the weekends are; hence we decided to make a trip down, albeit the prosecco brunch was full that weekend, we decided to try the ala carte menu for dinner. It wasn't any special occasion at all but everything that evening turned out to be so special for us. There was a warm welcome from a young lady standing at the front of the restaurant, and the service staff who served us was very polite and attention to detail! He even realised that I was feeling cold and offered warm water without us asking, and offered me a shawl. Guess what, the good things didn't stop, after ordering our food (my husband and I decided to share), we were recommended by the manager to try the lobster tagliolini and I was feeling "fish". The two dishes turned out to be really fantastic! The cod especially was very special and I would definitely want to return back again! Maybe try the prosecco brunch the next time; i guess we just have to book earlier in advance

We were there for a special occasion over lunch last Tuesday, Sept-23rd and opted for the 4-course set lunch option. I selected the Salmon as my main and my partner requested for Linguine with clams but requested for it to be swapped with a prawn linguine aglio olio style as she could no do clams. We were surprised needless to state could not imagine that what was being served was from an establishment claiming to be "A gastronomic tour of Italy". It wasn't even close! The salad was withered and tasteless. The soup was a poor attempt of a jazzed up minestrone soup form a box. My Salmon did appear presentable and that was the only consolation. For my partner's linguine, you could tell all that was done was clams were removed and 4-sickly looking prawns were thrown in. (We had conveyed to make a prawn Aligo Olio when requesting the change...you get the drift). For dessert they only had the Tiramisu, which was bitter and inedible. We could not believe we were dining at the St. Regis as just the weekend before we dined at the Chinese Restaurant - Yan Ting, and were in full praise of the service and quality of food that was served! It was a special occasion for us and therefore I did not wish to make a big ruckus. However I did sound it off to our server who paused and then retorted "But the salad was good, right". He went away only to come back 2-mins later and apologise and conveyed that I share my feedback on TripAdvisor! Shocking!! We decided to order some coffee and immediately were told it was chargeable. Ok can we still order coffee?? Even our request for a decaf low-fat cappuccino and a low-fat latte could not be served without mistakes and being sent back. So much for the service! For the amount paid, this was a criminal attempt and a regrettable mistake on our part for dining at LaBrezza on such a special occasion! Truly disappointing especially on such a special occasion

Went there twice so far. Service was nice. Very busy on weekend, must make reservation first. Very laid back on regular business days. You can even have a chit chat and do a special request dish with the nice Chef when the guests are very minimal on regular days. Fresh delicious oyster, lobster and other seafood on weekend. They also have weekend barbeque but I have never tried it yet. Don't forget to try their pizza. The only negative review I'd say is the Aglio Olio is a bit bland to my taste, though the carbonara is fantastic

Being a restaurant located in a 5 stars hotel guarantees you nothing. I had lunch with my family at La Brezza in St Regis on 24 Aug 2014. We all had the Weekend Prosecco Brunch. We started late on our lunch and we noticed that food were not replenished fast. We tried almost everything on the menu.I loved cheese but the cheese served at Antipasti selection were in such a sad state that it turns off my appetite for cheese.For pasta, I tried Aglio Olio and my sister had Vongole. Aglio Olio is the most basic of pasta yet what I had was the worst Aglio Olio. The pasta was swimming in a bowl of oil and it was a total failure. We also had Pizza Vesuvio. The pizza base was far too thin and our pizza came partially burnt.We also had steaks but the waiters who took the orders failed to ask us how we would like our steaks to be done. My brother in law ordered a serving of Controfiletto al Ferri (striploin steak) and Calamari and Prawn Alla Griglia. He requested the Calamari and Prawn Alla Griglia to be served later but both orders came at the same time. It was a good thing that the waiter who served the dishes offered to place another order for Calamari and Prawn Alla Griglia. The prawn was not very fresh and there was only 1 prawn in the serving. The chef should have split the back of the prawn before cooking to make it easier to consume the prawn. We also ordered a serving of Scottadito (grilled lamb chop). It was hard and dry. All the servings from the grill were very small.There were some saving grace. Spigola al Limone (seabass with lemon butter sauce) and Polletto alla Diavola (Spicy Spring Chicken) were not bad (in comparison to other dishes).All in all, it was a disappointing experience. To summarize our experience, we felt that the chefs who prepared the food do not understand or know what is Italian food. We felt that the food was not worth the value of what we have paid. We could have much better and satisfying food for the same value at other restaurants. I paid about $84 per pax

I liked the pasta I ordered. The wine was okay. My high-maintenance parents weren't impressed. I think it has room for improvement.

Despite its name and advertisement, there is nothing Italian about this joint. The whole restaurant is staffed by Indians, including some chefs. There are a few pasta and pizza items on the menu, but that's about as "Italian" as it gets! I ordered a steak to be cooked rare. But it came well-done. I had to return it. By the time the replacement was served, my lunch partner had finished his main course. On top of this mishap, the restaurant did not have record of my reservation, which I did a day earlier online. What an embarrassment! Not a place I will re-visit, nor will I recommend it to anyone who wants genuine Italian cuisine, and good service

This intimate restaurant on the 2nd floor of The St Regis Singapore is a gem. It has less than 15 tables indoors coupled with a few outdoors by the pool. What you pay is what you get. Quality is what you would expect and this was delivered quite outstandingly. The food portions are understandably large. My partner and I shared a Calzone (folded pizza filled with smoked cheese and black olives). It was huge and definitely sufficient for two, particularly if the both of you are small eaters. The Branzino (Tuscan sea bass) was oven-baked to perfection, albeit a little tiny. For dessert, we had the ever-popular Tiramisu Veneziano (with bitter dark chocolate flakes) and the Cannolo Alle Mandorle E Pere (almond and ricotta cannoli). Both desserts were perfection and a fitting close to the evening.

The brunch buffet in St Regis is trully define, beautiful set up, and the food all taste amazing. Devan is really good with customer service. All the staff are really friendly and helpfull. Very recomended if you ever come to Singapore.

“I’m heading to St Regis for a lunch buffet.”As if part of an enchantment spell, those words elicited a couple of wows and envious coos from my friends. Such reactions are bound to ensue, given the stalwart’s five-star rating and stately grandeur. By association, all its food operations should be equally stellar, right?Not quite, and LaBrezza at St Regis refutes my (now mistaken) notion that lavish hotels are the go-to addresses for a splendid meal. My friend Phebe —yes, spelt without the ‘o’— and I were there on a Saturday, eager to relish a lovely Italian brunch. So excited we were, thinking about the number of times we would drive our index fingers into our cheeks: the hand gesture for ‘molto buono’ or ‘delicious’!Read more: http://aldenboon.com/bon-vivant-on-the-lamb/2014/3/1/before-you-head-to-labrezza-don

I've been in LaBrezza on 27 January. I eat very well, the best italian food in Singapore.I'm very happy to find here Chef Stefano, I found him again here, after i met him to Ochre. He advise me and my wife for the food and for the wine, lobster risotto & truffle was fantastic, i think i've never eat something like this. It's not easy to find a Chef that speak with the customers, he is very kind an gentle.The restaurant is very nice and clean, I'll come back again to meet Stefano and his risotto!

My friends and I would like to have a small gathering and celebrate Chinese New Year at the same time. Instead of keep eating "Yu Shen", we would like to try something different so we decided to dine in at Labrezza. This restaurant is in St Regis Hotel. We noticed there is a oyster counter when entering the restaurant. The counter filled up with different type of oysters and we were quite excited coz WE LOVE TO EAT OYSTERS!!!!! While we were drooling when we saw the oysters. A chef approached us and introduced himself as Chef Stefano. He is quite friendly and patiently explained to us the type of oysters that they have. Also, he shared with us that they have a new brunch with seafood counters serve oysters and lobsters. It sounds interesting for us. We were famishing and ordered the oysters and tagliolini lobsters. It tastes so delicious. After that, we ordered those little desserts from all carte. There is a waiter called Raj and his service is really good. Overall, we are happy to dine in this restaurant with great food and wonderful service. We would recommend our friends to dine in this restaurant especially friends who love to eat oysters. :

It was a small dinner affair to catch up with old friends. The restaurant is tucked away in a quiet corner by the pool, which makes it an intimate and cosy for a lovely dinner spot. Devan and his team provided us with exceptionally good service that made us feel welcomed and enjoyable. Devan was very patient to recommend us our main courses as I was definitely spoilt for choice. Chef Prabu also got out to check on his guests and to gather feedback, which was good. This showed that he cared about his guests and ready to improve on his craft.Thank you LaBrezza team for making it a wonderful evening for us :

Had a wonderful brunch at LaBrezza, the food was great and the service was impeccable, from the manager and the staff, compliments to the Chef, the blueberry risotto was quite good. interiors can be improved. Ambiance was very relaxing with the view overlooking the pool

we had our dinner there last night and everything was nice. from the reception to the waitresses and especially the food. the pool view was nice and the manager was very accommodating. would certainly recommend for anniversaries and close gatherings or dates. :))) thanks for the great night guys! kudos

Celebrated my aunt's birthday at LaBrezza and it was a memorable night. Some of the dishes are quite authentic and we especially enjoyed the pizza. Very attentive service from staffs, with special commendation for Raj who had been so patient with our questions about the food and wine. Raj had even gone all the way to meet my uncle's request and located the wine which my uncle had drunk at Labrezza a year back but forgot the name. With Raj's help, finally they came to conclusion which one it was. Fortunately there were still stock and my uncle was so happy, he bought 3 bottles. A big thank you to Raj for making our night!

My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful meal at LaBrezza when we visited the St Regis in Singapore last month. Even though we arrived at the restaurant rather late we were warmly welcomed by the restaurant manager Devan. We sat outside overlooking the pool which was lovely. Chef Stefano introduced himself personally and gave us his recommendations, many of which we ordered and were not disappointed. This was Italian food like we had never tried before. Every dish was excellent, in particular the Cavatelli with Lobster and the Burrata which was delightful. Paired with an excellent Malbec it was an unforgetable meal. We can highly recommend the food, service and atmosphere of LaBrezza and will definitely visit again on our next trip to Singapore

One of the best italian food. Food was great. The sunday brunch for italian food was something different alacate cum mini buffet. Staff service was excellent n personal. 2 staff name to be mentioned are Mr Yogga and Mr Devan. Thank you for the wobderful lunch

We went there twice in the same month. The food was excellent and the service impeccable. On our second visit we were early welcomed by "kau...." which was impressive. We loved the personal touch in the service by "Chef Stefano" and would definitely want to go there again!!

My husband and I enjoyed a romantic poolside dinner at LaBrezza. Chef Stefano personally introduced his favourite menu items to us and delivered them along with his team of professional wait staff. The Ciopinno with braised lobster was the most delicious dish I have ever experienced
4
I am return customer. The food is still as great as before. I noticed there are some aquariums fill with live lobsters and crabs in the restaurant. Surprisingly, the chef Stefano still remembers me and recommended me to try his live lobster specialities dishes. The lobster risotto tastes really good. My friends and I really love it! The service also very good, We had a wonderful evening at Labrezza! Cool~~

Food was terrible. Service was slow. They messed up our orders (undercooked lamb, wrong items served, long wait). When we complained about the wait and order mix-up, the Chef came out and scolded us!?!
5
Saturday Brunch was fantastic by the pool. Friendly staff with all smiles around, food was served at its best (MUST try the BBQ station) and service was impeccable. Kudos to Mohamed, chef and crew! Again, a great great way to start a weekend!

Me & my boyfriend was looking for a good restaurant to have one special dinner. As we are both food lovers we tried so many restaurants in Singapore & we are one of those people who's very kin of what we are taking in...So we decided to go on our way to one of the restaurant in St. Regis which they called La Brezza, an italian cuisine with a relaxing view. We became the first guest to try their new specialty which is the fresh Lobster from the tank. Which is so amazingly tasty good which they cooked a la minute but indeed reach beyond my expectations.. Credit to their Italian Chef Stefano who came straight to our table to make our menu with us. We also tried their specialty home made burrata which is really good. I guess theres too much improvement compared from our last years visit. I definitely recommend!!!For these I commend all their staff who gave us an amazing experience and we decided to try their brunch soon
4
We had a great meal at La Brezza where we went to celebrate our birthday (my fiancé and I share the same birthday!) and we were treated to a fantastically flavorful meal, great service and to top it off a tiramisu birthday slice with a candle in!The food was amazing, the home made mozzarella for starters was divine, my pappardelle with venison ragout was light, but tender and mouth wateringly tasty, Rachel's Sea Bass with vegetables was cooked to perfection and looked fantastic.What made the meal even better was the service - always on hand to help but without standing around waiting so we had plenty of privacy, their knowledge of the menu was first class and help with the wine choice was equally good. The chef - Stefano Arrigoni - came out to make sure we had enjoyed our meal and ask for feedback, a really nice touch and then when the whole team came out and sung Happy Birthday it was a great end to a perfect night. I would highly recommend La Brezza, food is 5/5, service is 5/5 and for a special occasion it was the ideal place. It is expensive for a regular meal but I would happily recommend to anyone and we will certainly be back their again. Top work Stefano and his team. Paul & Rache

Truly amazing dining experience! The food was absolutely delicious and divine. Chef made the best pasta and pizza ever! The service was superb and staff were very attentive. In general, a good vibe! I would come again and recommend to other people
5
I would highly recommend this restaurant. This is my second time dined in this restaurant. My friends and i love the food. The food taste really good and full-flavoured. We never expected the chef would approached us to get our feedback on the food. He introduced himself and told us that his name is called Stefano and he is the new chef of this restaurant. Also, he informed us there is a brunch on Saturday and Sunday and we should try it. The chef is quite friendly. We ordered the lobster cappellini, veal chop and truffle pizza for sharing. The food tastes so good :) Overall, food is delicious and nice ambience but the price is a bit on the high side. We think is worth paying this amount of money to enjoy good food

This is a fake in all views : to start with the cuisine is NOT authentic italian, but a poor attempt to copy some "italo-fusion" without any refinement. The service is not what you expect in Singapore, let alone a such fine Hotel as the St Regis. And to finish, the bill is the only "great thing" about this travelers-trap. Avoid

- We waited for 30 min for coffee. After two reminders, only 3 of four coffees were served- The staff didn't know what the Risotto special was (which was the only special on the menu)- We ordered pine apple juice, which never came- We ordered flan, that never came- We asked for a second serving of tiramisu, which never came- Coffee wasn't hot- We never received plates, cuttlery and food at the same time and always had to ask for plates or forks- Table wasn't cleared. For example, the first coffee cup we finished stood on the table till we left. Pizza plate wasn't removed until we repeatedly asked for it- The music became so loud at some stage, that we couldn't talk at normal voice volume anymore- And to round it all up, we were overcharged with the bil

We had been to the restaurant some time ago, but rated the brunch we had on Sunday 23 Feb to be outstanding and will return for more.Ambience is 5 stars for a perfect Sunday brunch - glorious sunshine without compromising airconditioned comfort, teasing scent of grilled food whet the appetite and the lively pool view completes the relaxing atmosphere.Menu - the guests opted for non alcohol and skipped the Prosecco. Starters were impressive spread of greens, salads, salmon... cheeses. The variety of tomatoes and grilled asparagus wowed us. Our lamb chops were perfectly pink and the prawns were done just right. If anything to fault on, we thought the pasta Aglio could be better. Desserts were irresistable. Staff Attention - Benchmarking against experiences in town, La Brezza's standard is one up. Generally courteous and friendly, and certainly accommodating. Ridhuan, Jonathan and Sarah were few that we interacted with that ensure our meals were served warm and timely.Overall, it was a delightful afternoon and we could have stayed all afternoon if not for our other commitments
