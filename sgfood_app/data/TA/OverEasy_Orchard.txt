Ambience and food were good. Service staffs were polite and friendly, but the service wasn’t quick due to the crowd on Valentine Day.
5
Nice dining atmoshpere. Amazing quality food esp reccommend the mac n cheese. Truffle burger was full of truffle taste. However the patty could be improved as I ordered medium well and it tasted abit tough and could be seasoned better.
4
Had an enjoyable dinner at Overeasy at Liat towers. The to-die-for burger patty was thick, juicy and had nice medium doneness. Loved the lobster tatter tots too. Nice ambience when the candles were placed on every table! Service staff were quite attentive as well.
4
Food was a little pricey but good (had the fried chicken burger and spicy buffalo wings), ambience was dim but with good music.
4
Love the beer can chicken, hearty American fare that leaves you feeling satisfied. $5 whisky pairing with beer is good value but do remember to order them together
3
Dined here on a Saturday for brunch. Ordered chicken burger, mac n cheese, waffles with ice cream and flat white. The chicken burger was average but the Mac n cheese was extraordinary. Waffles and coffee were good too. Service was good but the food is over priced. I guess it's because of the location
3
Not too impressed with this place. Have been to the other Overeasy some years back but this time round when I was around for lunch, there lacked a similar charm to the first. food was ok at best, and service is also very fickle, sometimes good, sometimes bad. The only redeeming factor was that the staff were really nice to shelter me out to the next building during the heavy rain at the end of my meal
5
We chanced upon this place a couple of months ago, and it has been our regular hangout since then. Service was great (a place where cold beer was served quickly), and the beer can roast chicken was amazing (not to mention that there are not many places in SG where one can find beer can chicken). I especially love the $5 whiskey after a beer promotion which was very value for money. One thing to note is that the beer can chicken takes ~40 mins to roast, so it is good to call in advance and let them know when you want the chicken to be ready (to prevent long waiting time)
4
Had dinner on Sunday evening and place was quite empty. Service was great, can see staff are better trained than most other restaurants.Food did not disappoint- waffles were delicious and fluffy, Mac & Cheese was one of the best around, baby back ribs were “ fall-off-the-bone” tender!Milkshake were thick and creamy, not too sweet.The famous Chicken Beer Can unfortunately was just mediocre.The burgers were good too
5
I love everything about Overeasy at Liat Towers Outlet. From the ambience, to the food, drinks and services. Everything is great! They even have a birthday shot and a mini birthday cake for me at the end of the dinner. I would definitely recommend Overeasy even is just for a casual catch up session with friends.
3
Menu is quite limited. Portions are American sized, prices reflect the same too. Service was okay as it was rather quiet.
4
The food that we ordered were up to our expectations, nice! Would go back for the ambiance and drinks with friends :)
4
It was indeed a good Sunday afternoon to have a brunch with my friends. We chose this restaurant due to a birthday celebration. In addition, the food was fabulous. We expect a bigger portion of the Beer Can chicken. The portion too small.
4
The food was great with large portions of items on the plate. Milkshakes were to die for (creamy and thick) and the burgers were awesome.
4
The service is good.. But the food is not as good as previously.. The atmosphere was good oso.. But Abit too noisy..
3
We had the ribeye steak with eggs ($42) and the truffled lobster mac and cheese ($48). The steak was very well done - tender and juicy, but the lobster mac and cheese was not particularly good. In fact there was a bit of a smell (the truffle?); certainly for $48 one would expect something more.The lobster tater tots ($14) were ok with the dip; and the broccoli and avocado salad ($16) was average (dressing somewhat sour). Service from the friendly server was great. It was warm and attentive, such a rare thing these days
3
The dining very American style, but the variety not so many. The pricing are abit steep. Not for budget dining option
3
Was here two times because friends recommended it. Personally i find the food tasteless, its just american burgers and breakfasts. Too expensive for what you get. Would rather go on mcdonalds. But the overeasy restaurant near fullerton is much nices because of the view. While the one in orchard is not that cosy and the service is so-and-so. Its ok if you need some fast food or cheaper happy hour drinks in the area but would not recommend for a birthday meal or nice family time
4
Food was not bad, but not the cocktails and wines. Great for gathering with friends and colleagues. Convenient location
3
This was my First visit at Overeasy! I love spicy food so I came here to try the spicy wings. We tried Level 3 CRAZY MOFO, & I have to say it was not too bad. Other dishes I would recommend are the Lobster tater tots and Chicken & waffles were not too bad as well.One thing to feedback was the temperature in restaurant was a bit hot and stuffy. Even though we were seated inside, we couldnâ€™t feel any cool air. Most probably because the restaurant is a open concept with the main doors wide open
4
Atmosphere was full of activities. People cheering and celebrating with good music. Not forgetting good tasty food.
4
Easily located, just beside Wheelock. Must order the beer can chicken & 1 for 1 drinks during happy hour!!
4
Food is nice but slightly on the pricey end. Atmosphere is not bad, depending on where you seat, music can be slightly too loud, making it difficult to chit chat
3
The food was average - burger patties were on the drier side, and the waffles we ordered were slightly charred. The service was great though, the crew was extremely attentive and accommodating.Place is extremely dark, and Needs decent indoor lighting.
2
the foods are so so , not a big portion, enough for girls but not boystaste wide is reasonable but i think TGIF or Morganfields these similar kind of American restaurants have better food varieties and taste. we were there for our bff xmas gathering restaurant deco is american style, but light is too dim. services were great, water was refilled when request
2
Having been a patron of this particular OE outlet for a few years; I was somewhat dismayed by the poor service. The member of staff who was working the bar was not in the slightest bit interested in the responsibilities of being in charge of that area. Upon entering I handed the menu that had fallen from the outside display;on the main orchard road footpath; no thanks offered. I personally prefer to sit at the bar as opposed to a table for four as more often than not I am alone. After ordering my preferred drink (beer) and a snack; i tried to engage the bar-person in light conversation which was greeted with a "cannot be bothered" look, attitude; who then proceeded to finish their personal drink; in full view of customers; wash the glass under a running tap and then place back on the rack where the other (supposedly clean) glasses were stored. No detergent used in the cleaning; I feel for the next customer or staff who was issued that glass afterwards. Normally when seated at a bar; you are the closest to the person serving there and as such would expect the bar-person to notice when your drink is finished and inquire if you would like another; thus increasing sales for the business. I ended up having to order a second drink form the floor staff as the bar-person was not available. I do hope that the senior management of the Lo & Behold Group review posts from customers and look into areas of concern. This particular post in now way reflects the many enjoyable times I have had on previous visits and always recommend this outlet to friends. My personal favourite item on the menu is the Pastrami Sandwich - a definite must-try
5
Great place for gathering! Quality of the food is totally valued for the money. Servers were friendly and quick on their feet
4
Service and food is good but the lighting are pretty dim. I will definitely go back again to patronise
5
Wonderful relaxed atmosphere. Service staff are always hovering around and alert to when you need them but they succeed in not being intrusive at all. Love the gin and tonic there.
3
Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant at noon of October 15th, it was very difficult to get the attention of the staff. The service is below average and they ended up charging my card twice for the same bill
5
I had the chicken burger, mac & cheese and the corn dog and my personal favourite is definitely mac & cheese and corn dog! I would recommend any cheese lovers to go for these 2 snacks as it is great!
5
Great atmosphere, music, food and company. Comfortable and ideal place for catching up with friends. Nothing to complain about!
4
Portion was a little small, but the service was good! It was raining and they texted to offer umbrella if we did not have any
5
My first time at Overeasy, got a voucher and decided to check it out. The restaurant has a nice American burger joint feel, I didn’t find what I wanted for what the voucher includes and the staff was gracious to offer to check if I could still use it instead of flatly reject. The truffle burger and fried chicken burger were delish! Serving is generous. Very nice outdoor seating as well. Good for gatherings. I’ll be back
4
Why is the lighting inside so dim? It was the deal breaker. The truffle burger was pretty good! Milkshakes are so-so
4
Truffle mushroom burger and sweet potato fries are great. Small serving and pretty pricey. Good selection of Happy hour 1 for 1 beers
5
Came here for dinner with a couple of friends. Service was on point. You could see the manager being quite on the ball. We were about to ask for ice water refills and he already directed a staff over to replenish.Food was amazing, especially the beer can chicken. It was a nice touch that the service staff offered to carve the chicken for us. One of the most tender and juiciest i had in a while. The wings were really good too.Overall, a very nice experience but a little on the pricey side. Would come back once in a while to indulge for sure
4
Came here for lunch ordered the half slab bbq back ribs and waygu burger which cost SGD65/-. The food was nice and services are good. Can sit either inside or outside
4
This restaurant serves delicious food albeit items are on the pricey side. Not a venue for quiet moments as they play loud rock music
5
Overeasy Orchard, amazing food and amazing service. What i like about overeasy Orchard particularly is the service as they are very attentive to my friends and i during their peak period.Staff are very friendly as well. Gives me their best recommendation on food. Which is their burgers. Absolutely, love it.
4
The experience of beer pong with my friends was really fun.
The waffles and chicken was great! Beer is good too.
5
Love the vintage vibe, food, service. Great place for catching up and taking photos. Overall very nice experience.
4
Attentive staff, good service. The burgers were pretty good but what we liked most about this restaurant was the atmosphere! Really nice and chill
3
Whilst super convenient and easy-to-find as dining venues go for the tourist, am less generous with my feelings towards its food. OverEasy has been touted to be one of the better burger joints on the island, and admittedly it is pretty decent (don’t waste your time at Hard Rock Cafe down the road), the more adventurous person with a deep hankering for a real awesome is better off finding one at at Potato Head, Keong Siak St/ Chinatown area. Service at OverEasy was very good but is that enough for a second visit? I’ll take a rain check
4
The beer can Chicken is one of the best roasted chicken I’ve ever eaten! Would definitely go back again! However, it is quite pricey, hopefully they can lower the price!
5
Had the chiken and waffles which was delicious and worth it, Philly steak sliders was not too bad but not worth the price, Burgers were awesome and the best of the lot.... the sweet potato fries!It's a must order! Will definite return for the food and drinks :
4
Place to go if you have burger cravings.. I had the hangover burger, and I'm glad they allow me to change the bacon to sautéed mushroom. Didn't like the "shredded" fries though - tasted dry
3
Burgers and Cheese Steak was really nothing to write home about. I guess this is a situation where my expectations outpaced reality. The chicken wings were good.
4
Great food, nice atmosphere and good service. The temperature of the beef patty was just right. Will visit again.
5
My friends and I were there for dinner and throwing a secret birthday celebration for one of our friend. The crew at Overeasy were accommodating and allow us to keep our pre-bought cake in their refridgerator. They even surprised our friends and I with their ice-cream cake (on the house), and a complimentary polaroid. :) Thank you for the wonderful service
5
Had a birthday dinner at OverEasy and the crew was so nice to bring the surprise cakes to both our birthday boys. Food was great and everyone's happy. Kudos!
4
the food at overeasy was good. love their malt milkshake. but it's really expensive like $12 for a milkshake. atmosphere wise the seats were comfy and the layout of the restaurant was interesting, but i personally did not like the dark environmen
5
Pricey but quality and customer service makes up for it. Truffle burger with sweet potato fries are the best.
1
The restaurant had a promotion under the inaugural TLBGFEST for 1 beer can chicken and 10 bottles of Pure Blonde Ultra Low Carb Lager for the first 50 to reserve a table with the promotion code. I succeeded in securing a reservation on 20.6.17 at 12 noon. I initially ordered only the chicken and 1 bottle of lager. Towards the end of my meal, I requested another bottle of lager. The waiter with the mini ponytail near the crown of his head rejected my request, claiming that since I did not have to pay for my meal, he was not obliged to serve me. He added that I should have requested all 10 bottles at one go. I replied that I was unable to drink so much at one sitting, and diners are not allowed to takeaway the leftovers under this promotion. He told me to just throw away the balance, but I was reluctant to waste the beverage. He repeated himself, and I reiterated my refusal to discard any opened but unconsumed bottles. Seeing his obstinacy, I deliberately challenged him to serve me the remaining 9 bottles immediately. He was taken aback, as he did not expect my response, and finally asked a waitress to give me a second bottle.This waiter's poor service will repel any potential future diners. A person who has a negative complimentary meal will definitely not return to patronize this restaurant. In addition, as the food and beverage industry is so competitive, those who learn about this incident via word of mouth and online reviews will think twice about dining here
3
Overeasy is the modern Billy Bomber but decked out in blue instead of red. The ambience was way too noisy for a decent conversation amongst the 7 of us. Food wise, the finger food was exorbidantly expensive for the amount and tasted average. The non-alcoholic drinks are equally expensive and average in general. My $14 root beer float came in a pathetic 400ml mug and it was a costly mistake I will advise you not to commit
5
I like the environment, its nice! i celebrate my friend birthday, all waiter/ress were so helpful :
5
Awesome food and drinks. All time favourite Pop Corn Chicken, Waffle Wings, and Chocolate milkshake. Great place for girls night-out.
3
Prompt service.. Extensive menu... but food is pretty average.Good for quick weekday dinner but the place is too dim..
4
Had a quick lunch at overeasyVery good burgersBuffalo wings were well done but the serving was smallAverage servic
4
They serve a good selection of menu items. The food is generally on the pricey side. Service was fine
3
Decent burger at Orchard road prices. Pretty quiet on the weekends so my friends and I decided to hang here
4
The food was good and the interior was quite nice! Service staff were attentive and it was overall a pleasant experience :
2
$80 for 2 burgers and fries, a chocolate milkshake and a coke. The burgers and shake were nice but nothing special and certainly not worth the ridiculous cost.The waitress proceeded to stand in front of us with an iPad displaying this ridiculous receipt rather than give us the paper copy. She then waited for us to pay rather than letting us do it in our own time (which every other customer was given?)We had accepted the meal would be fairly pricey but a service charge of 10% and tax was then added. Service? Bringing over a burger and fries hardly constitutes an extra 10% charge!We had the intention of getting a half decent burger and ended up getting a very average meal with a substantial bill. Would not recommend to anyone.
5
Above and beyond expectations of service! Didnt know what to order, got excellent recommendations from the staff with the octopus tattoo. Beer can chicken was excellent and so was the starter platter. The Melbac wine was a bit off, but your crew gladly helped replaced with a Shiraz. Happy hour Blanc were great! We loved it sooo much that after our third set it was after happy hour. But your bar manager was kind to offer us one for the road at happy hour price all thanks to Father's day, really Appreciate the kind gesture. The icing on the cake was the Very appropriate gift of a whisky glass for Father's Day. We had a wonderful time thanks to your amazing staff. Great job guys
4
Cool and fun ambience for drinks and catching up. The portion for food to share is a little small. For example, 4 buffalo wings for $10! And pretty expensive. Beef cheeks mac and cheese were good but somewhat pricey too. Cocktails are good.
5
Amazing service, friendly staff and good ambience. We even got complimentary dessert since we're celebrating our graduation. Would come back again to try the food
4
Staff respond is quick and service is good. Selection of foods coverage is good. As two of my colleagues are vegetarian, staff is conscientious in handling their requested orders
4
Though a little pricy, the food was great. The happy hour (5-8pm) gets you drinks 1-for-1.Service is a little slow, though
4
We return to OverEasy for the great tasting burgers. The servers are always friendly. They have good happy hour deals during the week though this visit was special for Mothers Day.
4
We went for a leisurely brunch to overeasy. Ambiance was very relaxed and luckily the place was not very noisy, though it caters to families largely. Food ranged from average to good, depending on the order. Burgers were good, while the breakfast platter was ok and truffle fries we did not care for much. Service was slow. Decent place to spend a relaxed weekend brunch.
5
Dined at Overeasy on Mother's Day. Not only was the staff very accommodating, friendly and polite, they even brought out a little dessert for my mom at the end of our meal.We had a very pleasant experience :
5
Had a great and awesome dining experience there! A great shoutout to Kisha, Tish, Elsie, Deva and the great team who were ever so warm and generous with their smiles! Was there for a very belated birthday dinner I owed a good friend of mine, was taken aback (for all the good reasons) by the surprise birthday amenity extended at the end of our dinner! This dining experience will be something I probably won't stop talking about for a Long time to come! Thank you guys
4
Anyone could easily miss this place if not paying attention! Ambience? Check. Bites? Check. Drinks? Check. Friendly staff? Check. Caught up with friends over drinks (great 1-1 promos!) and killer chili cheese fries! Staff were very accommodating and friendly. Ideal for after work drinks and maybe a secret date! Perhaps need to check on the air-conditioning despite being indoors :
3
Good: Very tasty food - good location - and we had a really excellent waiter.to improve: very loud; some of the portions were really small; their "clean eating" menu section includes bacon, hash brown potatoes (?!); prices end up being kind of high.With improvement could be a regular
5
Nice environment, good place to chill and relax with friends. Staff are very helpful to give suggestions when we place order.
4
Beer Can Chicken was really GOOD!! (Don't really understand why, but this dish was off the menu.) The dish is made to order, slight wait for it to be served, but was well worth it! Chicken was REALLY tender & juicy, the corn, carrots & onions that came along with it were good too. The way the dish is presented.. It's definitely worth a few camera snaps, before dissecting the chick! Staff offered to help cut & serve the chick, which was fantastic!Was there late morning, on a public holiday. Restaurant was still quiet, crew was tad bit slow to warm up too, but service was still ok overall. Crowd starts to build up towards late noon
4
The Mac & Cheeks was a must order! Sliders were good and loved the fries. Waffles and fried chicken was average though thus will focus on the rest on my next visit
5
The diner has booths around the outside of the floor however i found that the few times i was in here that they were normally pre-booked. The rest of the tables however were comfortable and there was plenty of space. There is also the option of eating outside if that's what you chose.The service was excellent however the only negative thing i would say is that it took a while for us to get our bill, but not any longer than anywhere else in Singapore i guess!The food itself was excellent, i had a "To Die For" burger which was one of the best i have ever tasted, the sides and desserts etc were also to the same high standard
5
The burger was awesome at OverEasy. Environment was good but don't miss the happy hour (6-8pm)! Goes well with burgers
4
2nd time back at overeasy. Great service as usual and decent brunch food! Only issue is that it's abit pricey for the type of food served.
4
Was there on the 26th April to celebrate a friend's birthday! Service was impeccable, ambience was great, food was good but not the best! Good place to catch up over a few cups of liquor (happy hour 1-for-1 does not apply for all but there's also $8 offer for cups of liquor like Moscato!)! Ambience was nice with soft music and (a bit too) soft lighting! All in all a great place, would definitely recommend and would definitely come back again
4
I've always been a fan of the burgers at overeasy and the cosy setting at the slightly below ground level of Liat Towers. Service wasn't that great this time when I went though, but thankfully the burger never disappoint
5
Excellent atmosphere, amazing burgers, great value - especially with the lenghty happy hour, which ensures a fun and reasonably priced afternoon/evening if you wish to partake in a few beers/wines/spirits with your meal.Highly recommended
4
The waffles with chicken wings & the MAC n cheese with wild mushroom was good ! Great place to chill :
4
While the food is of a decent quality, the price that we paid for is slightly too high. The dips for the vegetable platter was too thin as wel
4
Good but pricey. Burgers are small. One for one beers during happy hour is great. Go for the truffle burger and sweet potato frie
4
Great place for a fun night out with friends. Food was pretty good, mains were very generous with the waffle and fried chicken winning the dish of the night hands down.
3
Premium Spirit / wine and beer is 1 for 1 from 5pm-8pmSome finger food to recommend: OE fries (parmesan / truffle), sweet potato fries and Cheese stickTheir vegetarian burger (Veggie & Portobello mushroom) is very nice and juicy, it comes with fries"To Die For" burger (beef) and Reuben Pastrami Sandwich is delicious too.Advice to make reservation in advance for Friday & Saturday night.The ambience is average, the sound proofing is bad especially the whole restaurant if fully pack.
5
My wife and I were on a tour to Singapore, exploring Orchard Road. As we take a break from our long walk, in we went to OverEasy along Orchard Road. It was past lunch time and we ordered light meals. The food is good and surprisingly, our attendants named Samson and Camille were so hospitable and accommodating. The big surprised was when after excusing myself for the use of the restroom. out came a birthday cake complete with sparkler and a wish card followed by the singing of happy birthday and, to top it off, a chorus from all the guests in the restaurant. Honestly, quite embarrassing since I really got surprised and a first for me. Thank you very much Camille and Sam for the memorable visit! Hope to see you both again
4
Had a very nice burger with added egg on and chilli fries. Had only the burger with normal fries once before which was a little bit disappointing in size. But this time I was very happy with the meal :) Really satisfied my cravings after a night out drinking .
4
food is good, ordered the truffle burger, mac & cheese & the smokey the bear milkshake. will go back to try out other things on the menu.
5
Great flavours! Sure, there are better versions of OverEasy's dishes in the United States, but the American-style dishes of OverEasy are filling, satisfying and very tasty.
3
Nicely themed restaurant, pretty good food but portions could be bigger, especially the appetisers. I ordered a 1-1 drink during happy hour, and as my friends and i wanted different drinks, we ended up having all drinks served as they couldn't hold the 1-1. Perhaps this is something the management can look into.
5
The staff is world class. They will remember your drink on your 2nd visit. The Bar Tenders are "top shelf".The menu is simple but good at a fair price. I have been twice and am going back
4
I usually go to the outlet at Fullerton and this is the first time i was at Liat Towers. The food and the atmosphere were good. The staff were very attentive as well. Though Fullerton has the beautiful view of MBS, Liat Towers was cleaner. The one at Fullerton has their broken sofas taped together and it was sticky when i sat on them 2 weeks ago
5
Had a great time at Overeasy Orchard! Was given the booth seats which were really comfortable for a group of 7 of us! Food wise, we ordered quite a number of mains and sides to share, but would have loved if the sides were of a bigger portion (truffle fries & Mac & Cheeks).
3
Relaxed ambience with an old diner feel. They were able to accommodate our large party of 14 people and 1 baby. Great for brunch!
4
Enjoyed the 1 for 1 drinks with friends. Thought the ambience at Overeasy Orchard could have been livelier considering it was a Friday night
4
It was my first visit to OverEasy and I'm glad I chose that place to celebrate a birthday. The food was amazing and staff was very friendly. The only downside was the portions were way too small. If you're a big eater, you will probably be not impressed with that
5
The food was so good, we actually ended up ordering the same dish twice! And also, there are quite a few options for vegetarians, so all of us could eat stuff apart from just salads. The presentation of the food was good too and the waiters were nice and sweet.
4
If you're down for an American diner, this is definitely a must go in Singapore! Right in the centre of town, with good vibes
4
The place was way beyond my initial expectations. It's real romantic and any fun kind of girl would surely appreciate this place. Food+ staff+ ambience
3
Tried to celebrate a friend's dinner on Fri night (20 Jan 17). No issues with the food was the music was loud to the point of deafening. I understand that it was a Fri nite and music is supposed to get one in the weekend vibe. Not sure that having to go deaf in the process helps achieve that. We could not hear ourselves across the table and had to shout. Finally went to a diferent place to cut the birthday cake as everyone was hoarse by the end of the dinner
5
Close to my office and great place to chill out with friends after work.Will always recommend and go back for the their happy hour special Staffs also gave good food recommendation
5
Awesome service! Staffs were very friendly and also good was excellent! We enjoyed the meal and also our beers!
4
The only thing i can said is this restaurant provide the best cocktails in the town eventhought its pricey but i loved the singapore slin
5
We ordered a burger, mac and cheese and drinks to share. Bill came up to about 130. Service and food were excellent! Would go back agai
4
As a foreigner resident of Singapore, it can be challenging to find unpretentious western food. Overeasy serves generously portioned, good quality, American diner style food in a pleasant ambiance. The burgers are amongst the best in Singapore and a great treat on a lazy (hungover) day. Alternately, it is just a few steps away from the madness of Orchard Rd shopping thereby offering a convenient sanity break in a relaxed environment.
5
Nice cosy ambience with good tapas and happy hour drinks promo! Perfect for a chillout night with colleagues and friends
1
Food was below average and buffalo wings was cold when served. I thought I was the only one who finds the food terribly awful, even my friends find it awful. Sorry to say that, it's not worth the money
3
We enjoyed our burgers and starters but the music was too loud for our liking, the service at the beginning was non existing until some tables were filled.
4
Food is nice. Service is average. Didn't manage to get indoor seat due to some private event going on.
4
Must try breaded wings with waffles...crispy breaded wings...waffles fluffy and outside crispy, go with maple syrup is fantastic
4
We had burgers for lunch. It was very good value for money as it was a 1 for 1 promotion. Serving was generous and service was good.
5
Nice and comfortable. Food are tasty. Staffs are friendly and helpful ! FOC sparkling birthday candle 
4
Beer can chicken worth waiting 45min for! The Festive menu was value for money, enough for 4 and has variety of chicken, ham, fries, oniions, tarts... The food was fresh, set lunch of seabass and linguine very tasty. Only downside was there was extra charges which was not clearly evident on the memu
5
Service was great.Nice ambienceGreat food especially their special dish; Beer Can Chicken.Ordered the wine as there is promo.Overall the service, food and experience is top-notch
3
I would rate my overall experience at this restaurant as average. The standard of food are good and staff are attentive but the place lightings are too dim which makes it hard to tell if your food is cook well or not. The music is too loud and your friends have to speak louder that usual. The outdoor and indoor concept also does not work as the humidity from outside can be felt specially if you are seated near the entrance
3
I was anticipating having a meal here after much hype in social media. However, the food we got was just average. Specifically, we ordered the chicken BALT, kale pancakes and chicken with waffle. To be fair, they served good tasting coffee (flat white and cappuccino), but we didn't come for the coffee. The area is a bit dark as well, could do more light indoors
4
We reached there before 8pm and ordered a few drinks on their Happy Hour menu! Love their OverEasy Mojito! Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Sliders, 2 thumbs up! It's mini burgers so 1 can easily eat all 3! Had their Spicy Buffalo Wings and we asked for Hot Stuff (level 2), if you are not a person who can take spicy stuff, please select level 1. Level 2 is indeed hot! We also had Chicken Caesar Salad and Popcorn Chicken with Salted Caramel Popcorn - Thumbs up!Do make a table reservation before turning up, it can get filled up pretty fast during dinner period
4
Great service with a smile from all staff and I love the Mac and cheeks. The Broccoli salad with quinoa had a really nice bite because of the the nuts and raisins mixed inside. Heart! I love the revamped OverEasy.
4
The Ruben sandwich was outstanding. The mac and cheese was good too. My wife like the portobello sandwich. However, it is definitely the most expensive diner I've ever eaten at. Prices are more like a Michelin star restaurant than the diner. Despite how good the food is, the price/value is out of line and I probably won't return.
5
The service was good even though we had multiple changes to timing, food was great, an enjoyable evening we had
4
Good but pricey for what it is. A simple chicken burger and small beer for forty bucks. I shan't return; it's nothing special
5
Great concept, delicious food, reasonably priced and good atmosphere. One thing that will help is a service buzzer at the tables because we had a hard time to get their attention to place our orders
4
i had dinner and we shared Mac and cheese, popcorn chicken with salted caramel popcorn, Grilled Chicken B.L.A.T and Bourbon doughnut for dessert. I love the Mac and Cheese and the doughnut. They were delicious. The other 2 were rather fine though i find the combination of popcorn chicken and salted caramel popcorn to be rather odd.Overeasy had a not bad atmosphere for friends to hang out after work or on the weekends. I use to visit the Fullerton branch and have some drinks with friends. One could always take advantage of the happy hours they have for some drinks after work
5
First of all the ambience was amaIng and it really felt like an American diner. To add on to that, happy hour deals were real good and the buffalo wings were to die for
5
Ate here for the first time.Quality burgers. Attentive staff.Great hip-hop tunes but not overwhelmingly loud.Happy hour drink special was good value too. Would definitely retur

The brunch menu is good. Highly recommend their Mac n Cheese. Drinks were great too. Especially worth it during the happy hour. The service staff were attentive and friendly. Namely YueLing and Azwan. They even offered us board games to play. We enjoyed outselves and would definitely return

I had lunch with my family to celebrate my wife's birthday. The atmosphere of this restaurant was really American. The buger, steaks, buffalo wings and fries with chilli concarne was top notch. As well as their shakes. I'm planning to go back for to have a drink and dinner
5
What can I say about this place? It always delivers!!!As always we got the Buffalo Wings with spice level 2. It comes with a beautifully done blue cheese sauce and some celery and carrots. Portion is a tad small in my opinion.Also got the Philly Cheesesteak Sliders which were absolutely delightful. Polished them off in no time.Wash down with the Lemonade.Top service levels with smiling friendly staff. Will return
5
Easy, chill place. Always a go-to choice for a simple night out. Branding, interior on point! Good service, helpful staff.
3
The food was good. However, the environment was a little too loud that we needed to shout at each other to get our points across
5
Staff was helpful and we were surprised by the 3rd anniversary cake on Overeasy at the end of our dinner. Great food great time!
5
Love this place. Highly recommend the avocado on toast (get a poached egg on top too!).Staff always looking around to see who needs to be served, or to fill up your water glass etc. Seems like a small thing but just shows great service.Was here a few months ago and son became ill while we were waiting for our food, and we had to leave in a hurry without eating/paying anything. The staff were very understanding and kind. Another reason I'll keep coming back here. I didn't get a chance to say "thank you" at the time, so - thank you!Good tunes too :-
3
The burgers were good but I much preferred the 'Cheese on crack' sandwich which was yummy. Service started well but ground to a slow crawl as the lunch crowd grew and our orders for coffee took quite a while to arrive.
5
Had a great time! Mac and cheeks are amazing, and we were lucky enough to have Azwan help us out - best server ever
3
Truffle mac and cheese with wild mushroom was really good, great amount of melted cheese with flavored mushrooms. Waffles and breaded chicken was alright. Love the breaded wings, well seasoned, but waffles are Plain Jane and slightly burnt. They could have done a cheddar bacon waffles served with herb butter instead of regular butter
5
It's a great place to celebrate special occasions. Had my 2nd anniversary dinner here. The staff are friendly and hosted us really well. We felt at home. The food is awesome especially the cheese sliders. We ended the evening well with a complimentary dessert and balloon. Thanks for making this evening so special. Will definitely be back :)Blessings, Shaun and Ad

Fans of American food will love this new joint at Liat Tower, taking over the former Burger King restaurant. The food is truly awesome, I like the beer butt chicken with the nice spice marinade. Not to miss are the OE Truffle fries, buffalo wings and the "To Die for" burger. Service was great and the staff were patient and friendly to explain some of the items to you if you are not familiar. Great place for a chill out or gathering with friends

Best Mac n cheese and waffles in town. Gone here a few times and food is first class. Also try their milk shake with spike - it's a very interesting innovation !
4
We live in Singapore and had a craving for American-style burgers. This place hit the spot. Burgers were not huge, but enough for an average person. 2 for 1 beers (Asahi black on draft!) and the beer pong tables made for a nice family outing. Service was good as well; they brought out balloons for our kids. Price was S$130 for 2 adults +2 kids which is a bit much, but the location drives up the price
4
A 50's style decor bar/restaurant which has great music and a good choice menu (unless you have fussy kids like me). Service was warm and friendly and our waitress was willing to take a part order for the kids while we made up our mind. She also checked if my son's choice of drink was available. Food was freshly cooked at the open kitchen and was very tasty - a choice of style of fries including sweet potato which made a nice change. "Proper" thick milk shakes made with ice-cream were a great hit with my son & husband. My husband had the classic burger which he really enjoyed while I opted for a caesar salad with chicken which was very tasty. Our sons had the popcorn chicken with mashed potatoes - they liked the chicken but were not sure about the style of mash.All in all we enjoyed our visit and will be back
5
We had the best food here. Burgers were amazing chips were nice a crisp. Pretty fast service. Average prices. Good location
1
Small serving, expensive, definitely not worth it ! Won't be coming back, the vibe was cool but that's the only thing they can offer. Total rip-off
1
Went there during happy hour (1 for 1) and wanted to order the white wine. Only to be told that both glasses would come out at the same time, as their bar was rather haphazard and they couldn't keep their orders straight! Since they had so many complaints, they had decided that bringing both drinks at the same time was the only solution. No ice bucket was offered, to keep the 2nd glass of white cool. And when we asked for an ice bucket, the wait staff looked so bewildered like it was preposterous, and just blurted no. And all this in hot and humid Singapore... All the enjoyment of happy hour went out the window
4
Been here twice in about six weeks. Identical experience both times. Burgers are perfect - juicy, tasty, good size...... For some reason the servers are not. Both times were Saturday so maybe that's when the young inexperienced staff work. But they struggle to get the order right, they are slow to appear and they seem to have their minds elsewhere rather than on what they're doing. Or am I just getting too old. But more importantly the burgers ARE perfect
4
The breakfast sandwich was needed and enjoyed. Dropped in on a few occasions to sample the weekdays happy hour. Prices are reasonable for Singapore and the service and people are friendly and welcoming
3
Went for dinner and drinks with friends. Truffle Mac & Cheese is a must-try! Chocolate milk shake was good too
5
Third visit in a week~ Been hooked since the first. Food is wow. Beer Can Chix ftw! Avocado salad.. yumz for the tumz! Truffled mac n cheese.. heavenly! Ambience is great tho DJ's music choices could have been better at times. Cocktails-wise, go for the raisin or hot dates if you're an alcoholic! The rest kinda lightweight. Wines are good and safe choices too. Go during their happy hour promo(till 8pm); it's a steal!Last of all, service cannot be any better! Special thanks to Arthur for being exceptionally helpful!!! An asset to the service industry~ Looking forward to the next visit and trying the rest of the menu~~
5
This dinner was recommended by my friend and I'm so glad she did.It's located next to Zara, Starbucks and HSBC.They do a set lunch menu and a happy hour from 5-8pm.The food was really good and so was the service.I look forward to returning
4
The location was a bit of a surprise since not that many people would tend to look directly into Liat Towers since the assumption is there are only boutiques and coffee joints on that level. Still, it's nice to have eats on a street joint that's more known for ice-cream, juice and coffee. The food is decent, had the wings and waffles plus the donut dessert. The waffle was quite good, crisp without losing some of the fluff. If one had to pick bones, the cinnamon was a tad strong on the donut, a little overwhelming. Overall decent, saved by the price point in view of the location (in a less central location, the price point may need adjusting
4
At first this place was not as relax as the other outlet Fullerton. Coincidence they some events which turns the place around. Foreign DJ to perform to bring in crowd. Anyway, kudos to all the staffs at Overeasy Orchard.
4
Fun atmosphere. The Ruben sandwich was good as were the truffle fries. Outstanding broccoli and avocado salad. Some of the best service in Singapore.
3
Came here just try there all day breakfast expecting something special due to the name of the restaurant.All day breakfast 4 out of 10Seabass 5 out of 10Bloody Mary 9 out of 10Smokey Bear milkshake 10 out of 10Seabass was too small a portion for $34the All day breakfast too simple for my liking. No salt and pepper at the tables, no jam or spreads for the bread only butter and very dry bacon. Eggs, fish, milkshake and bloody Mary excellent
5
We happened upon this place on a Saturday and it was surprisingly empty for a lunchtime. We took advantage of this and had a great lunch. My daughter loved the mac and cheese and berry bonanza shake, while my husband said the Rueben sandwich was the best he'd ever had. My broccoli and avocado salad was also very nice - much tastier than the name implies! It's a little pricey but roughly the same as similar places selling western food. We'll be back sometime soon
5
The restaurant is spacious and airy. The service was swift and the food was good. The best Reuben I've had in seven years in Asia
5
The venue was spacious, though a little dim. But no big deal since we had candles on the table. Food was great - I'd recommend the Beer can chicken, truffle fries and Buffalo wings to share. Service was good too. Do go for their 1-for-1 happy hour drinks! It's very worthwhile
4
Service is good. Waiters were friendly, quick and efficient. However, the restaurant gets pretty dim at night. My beer glass was actually chipped and broken right at the rim when it was served to me. I guess it was quite difficult for the staff members to spot it cz it was pretty dark. But they were apologetic and were nice enough to replace my glass. I had their truffled mac and cheese, which was good. Food wise, good but nothing exciting. If you are looking to come and have fun drinking and playing beer pong, this is the place for you!! :
5
Over easy is my favourite place in Singapore the cocktail choice is incredible the hospitality second to none and the food is amazing. The staff are friendly and quick to tend you and Matteo the manager is always a smiling first point of call when you walk in and so personable we found him so attentive and his cocktails better than anywhere we've been in Singapore I massively recommend his Negroni. Do not come to Singapore and not visit Overeasy on Orchard Rd. You won't be disappointed.
4
Next to the wheelock place on orchard, you can find Overeasy very easily. Nice cool place for drinks and food after work. After a long tiring day at work, I prefer to sit outside in fresh air as opposed to air conditioning, this place has both. Overeasy is just the right place to unwind. Perfect for drinks and snacks, not many options for a complete dinner. Non alcoholic drinks can have more options. Great buffalo wings!!
5
Stopped in on a Friday night and were immediately greeted and seated at the bustling bar, which is a great seat for "dinner & a show"! Fantastic cocktails hand crafted by Matteo and staff, good food, friendly & attentive service, reasonably priced and conveniently located. Creative drinks with fresh, homemade ingredients...and if you don't see your fave on the menu, just ask. I asked if they could make a margarita and was pleasantly surprised with a strawberry jalapeÃ±o version served up! As for food, pastrami sandwich with sweet potato fries and crispy brussel sprouts won't disappoint
4
Love the ambiance, food was great & service was really really good! Will definitely visit again. :D

So during 2 weeks of Asia I do reach the point where I want some western food in between. Walking along Orchard Road I find this place, a bit hidden. Menu looks good, prices decent so I decide to give it a try. You can sit both inside and outside. Service is very good, fast and friendly, there is nice music, a good crowd of people. Food comes fast and taste is good (burger), next day I try the ribeye steak and again no disappointment! Nice cocktails available as well. Staff is friendly and they even find the time in between for a short chat. So if you are in Singapore and look for an alternative to the amazing asian food.....this is the place to go! There is a second restaurant in Fullerton road - but have not been there

Went at the restaurant with my family and seated outside. We are seated outside since only few tables are occupied. The chinese lady who went to our table to take our order is very rude, no smile, she's talking over walkie when we are talking to her, as if she's very busy when only 3 tables are occupied outside. We are trying to ask her about the menu but she gave us the impression as if she don't want to be bothered with us. Worst part is she was abviosly very happy serving other table with a caucasian guy customer and taking photos with them while we are waiting to be served. Seriously?? We are suppose to have our dinner there but i told my husband to just order drinks since we are alreasy seated and have a dinner somewhere else. I will seriously never ever come back to OverEasy at orchard anymore. It's a waste of money and waste of time. Staff needs to be trained and obviously management should look into this!!
5
Whether you're going with friends or solo, this place is a 'must visit'. The staff are really friendly, the drinks are great and the food is amazing. Keep a lookout for Elsie's infectious smile and addictive personality.

We went to have a late dinner at Overeasy before our midnight movie on Saturday. It's our second time to Overeasy but a different location - we went to the one at Fullerton previously.We had the crispy tortilla for starters, tasty double trouble burger and fresh seabass for the mains. For desserts, we tried the warm lava cake, which was very good. Not to forget, the service by the waiters was great, they were attentive and always smiling. Will definitely come back
5
Make a booking for tonight and at 5pm got a call back on confirmation which are personalised. Upon arrival, order all my food for our group of 11 persons. With the pace just right! Order their roasted chicken with beer! Is succulent and tender ( to die for). Pasta and salad was great and love their smoked salmon salad which was refreshing! Deep fried Brussels sprout is a dish was nice done. What was surprising was I remark that I am celebrating my daughter's birthday. They really did prepared some balloon and also a surprise dessert for her and took a photo for her! Service was efficient and friendly! Bravo to the team!! I will be back for the roast chicken ! Love their outdoor!! Comfortable and cosy!!
4
I got a call from the staff close to our reservation time. Thinking that it might be to ask if we are on our way. To my surprise, it was to inform me that it was pouring outside and they could shelter us from Wheelock Place or the taxi stand. The staff were attentive and polite when serving us too. We had drinks and small bites that night, will go back to try out the mains too
4
Placed a reservation to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday surprise dinner, for a total of 15 people. Arrived there with all my mates seated and waiting for us. We were seated indoors, but we requested to be shifted outdoors. Everyone started off with drinks before dinner, and when we were ready to order, the service crew were pretty efficient in taking our orders. Being a large group, was pleased that we didn't have to wait very long for our food. Most of us ordered burgers off the menu, burgers were on point, but kinda felt that for the price we were paying for the meal, the portioning for fries were a tad under-portioned. Couple of my mates ordered the all day breakfast set, which turned out to be pretty decent. Was very surprised myself and very pleased that the service crew came out with a birthday brownie, and an added surprise for the birthday boy. It was a very nice touch to the whole affair. We ended the night with more drinking and beer pong. The whole vibe was lovely, it was a chill night with friends, enjoyable ambiance, good food and drinks. Couldn't get enough of that night. Thank you Overeasy Team for making that night extra special for us

Was at the Liat Towers outlet on a Friday. Service was attentive but food was a hit and miss. Meat from the beer can chicken was tender but one of my friends complained that the grilled chicken from her burger was very tough (I didn't try it myself). Portions were very big and satisfying. The music was really loud though. With the loud music and the chatter of other patrons, my friends and I had to shout over the noise to hear each other. Probably not a very ideal place to hang out if you are looking for a place to catch up with friends
4
We enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much. Perhaps it was a busy night, it was not easy to get the attention of the service crew, but when you do, they are quite friendly and helpful
4
The burgers were alright - decent enough thanks to it being juicy with a well-toasted bun. I think it could have used a pinch more seasoning as I personally love very savory food, but I would definitely go back. Each burger comes with a side of fries which stayed amazingly crisp throughout my meal. The waitress was kind enough to suggest that we could change the default side order of a coleslaw to fries for the Rueben sandwich too. The mac & cheese was done very nicely in a small skillet pan, and topped with fine panko breadcrumbs. Cheesy, not too creamy or swimming in liquid, and just nice for sharing. The milkshakes were very creamy and delicious, but a little on the expensive side
5
As I do not take beef, upon hearing that, the staffs were able to change the the beef in the menu to chicken for me & my friends. They were also keen to recommend what food that can be shared by the few of us
3
Was there on a Friday night at the newer outlet at Liat Towers. Of course, it didn't have the vibe compared to the Fullerton one but it still stayed true to the American diner vibe. The only thing missing was maybe the wait staff should be on skates?? JUST KIDDING. I ordered a fruit mojito because on a humid day, it just seemed really apt but the sizing of the mojito was SO tiny, definitely not worth the $17 price tag. It was mostly ice and I didn't fully enjoy my drink because it was over before I know it. My friend ordered the bacon bourbon milkshake (delish!!!) which was served in a standard milkshake glass which was only $18! Serious portion issues here, Overeasy... Moving onto food, we ordered The Truffle burger and Mac & Cheese. The first was moist and tasty. I liked that they allow you to change your fries to their famous chilli beef fries so you get the best of the best. The Mac & Cheese tasted decent and good portion for sharing. We didn't get any desserts because they just werent really appealing. Overall, it was a decent experience with a few things that could be done better. Staffs were attentive and made sure we had water throughout the night which was always, always nice. Oh and I asked for some pickles (I wanted to pay for it!!) and one of the managers gave them to me for free. Thanks for that, I enjoyed the pickles ALOT! For the ambience & vibe, I would suggest the fullerton outlet. For convenience, the Liat Towers one would do the job
4
We got booth seats near the open kitchen which were really comfortable and the staff were friendly and attentive. Food portions were big (for all girls group) so they are good for sharing, buffalo wings recommended if you like spicy food. The atmosphere is relaxed with 80s/90s pop music playing in the background when we were there. Prices are not cheap though, we spent about S$170 for 3 people (no alcohol, just food & juices).

We went to this place tonight at 9.30 p.m. It was not busy and lots of staffs. But service was quite bad. After we ordered drinks and snack. Nobody serve us a glass of water. I have to asked for 2 glass of water. After we both finish our glass of water no one came over to refill. There's a young lady which I guessing that she take care of our zone. She walked back and forth and see our glass was empty and never refill. I getting tired to ask for service. After we finished our foods. We saw one of waitress pouring ketchup to make it look full. But each bottle have an expiry date on it. How customer can trust those date if you mixed it all over like that? Very bad practice. This should NOT happens at all. She should using her time to care for the customer not for mess around with Heinz ketchup bottles and made a fault expired date for all of those bottle. We orders;- buffalo wings which was nice and dipping sauce was quite good. - Rosemary and pamasan Cheese fries which really nice. -a glass of red wine (Shiraz Cabernet) was good. -two Asahi draft beer was good. - two shot of Jameson Irish Whisky was good. Total price including 7% GSt and 10% service charge was 97 S$. Those 8.20$ for service charge not really well spent at all. No extra tip this time. The Ambience was always nice here. My score downed from 5* To 3 stars coz of very bad service quality and what I saw with Heinz Ketchup tonight. If you wanna try their food, Recommended to sit by the bar to get a better service. Not sure we will return
3
Let me start by saying this place isn't too bad (service was actually very good- maybe a bit overdone), but it's overpriced for American diner food. We started off with a clam chowder which was way too salty, and with very little clams. The broccoli salad was very ordinary, something I could have made at home (read: bland). The pastrami sandwich saved the day- thick, toasted (fried?) and tasty. Donut rings in cinnamon with chocolate dip was also very good. How much did we pay for lunch? About $70 for 2. It'll take me some time to come back.
5
We stepped in casually after work to have a beer but we were very well surprised by what we found. A barman proposed us few special cocktails and we were truly delighted ... something you will not expect. So we just sat at the bar counter letting him guide us and enjoying the service. I tried a "White Negroni", apparently a variation of a famous Italian cocktail, and it was very good. We have not tried the food, but the dishes coming out from the kitchen looked like good american comfort food. Within the expectations here. Only minor downfall is you must know about the cocktails or be lucky to be served by the barmen: the menu is not very clear on it and the kind of place does not really suggest to be a cocktail bar
5
A really nice surprise in the hustle and bustle of Orchard.This brand new place sibling of the one in Fullerton, just opened 5 months ago really deserve to be visited. We were welcomed by a really nice hostess that propose to us to sat at the bar counter, as soon as we approach the bar we were greeted and acknowledged by the Italian bar manager and Waiong we gave them carte blanche on cocktails and we were delighted and impressed by bespoke cocktails created for us with an amazing flair touch.Exceptional food was served as well,especially the famous steak sliders(4 are not enough! ) and the mouth watering pastrami sandwich the best so far in Singapore!This place wins hands down on quality and service
