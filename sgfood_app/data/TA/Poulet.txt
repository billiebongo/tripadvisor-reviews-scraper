Hungry after a day of adventure cove at sentosa we found our appetite at Poulet. It's fast and delicious, and but they didn't offer tap water not sure if it's because they forgot to ask or it's extra $for water.

Very good restaurant, well located inside the mall of Vevo city, nice decoration and excellent food. Perfect service

We had a family lunch, we all took chicken dish. Well prepared and tasty.
Very few tables occupied, service was ok.
5
We ordered the saut√©ed mushroom, lamb shank, mashed potato and butter rice. They were great combinations and the lamb shank was great. I will visit the next time to try other dishes.

The portions are medium sized and the taste is quite good. We had a half of chicken without any sauce (which we both shared), a salad, mashed potatoes, ratatouille, a black coffee and a green tea. The total was 56 dollars (including the service tax). Conclusion: a good choice, recommend

I‚Äôve just had lunch there, and it‚Äôs disappointingly below average. I had a pulled chicken sandwich, a special on limited offer, which looked nothing like the picture. It had only a very thin layer of chicken, and the french fries that came with it were almost stone cold. When I asked for some cold table water, was told they only had mineral water. Generally, I refuse to buy bottled water for environmental reasons (except in places where I can‚Äôt drink from the tap). The tap water in Singapore is perfectly fine for drinking. I can understand that they want to make money from selling mineral water, but they should give customers a choice.

Roasted chicken in lemon sauce was ok. Garlic bread would be one of the worst you will have in your life! Carbonara pasta was ok. Dessert was good. But overall nothing was good to the extend that make us want to come back. Not impressed and definitely won't recommend to anyone. (Visited vivocity outlet

the waiting time was ok. But the food was horrid. We ordered half a chicken and it was SO SALTY. It was as if the chicken was soaked in concentrated salt water over night. It was fortunate that we ordered only half and not one whole chicken. Ordered a bowl of onion soup too, it wasn't too bad but quite salty too. Poulet used used to be quite a popular restaurant with long queues initially. But it's not now. Their management should really look into their menu/recipes and taste the food themselves

Food was not good at all, the chicken was old, the sauce with the chicken very weird, I could only finish my fries while I was starving. Such a shame to call this restaurant French! I am French and never tasted something that bad! Will never be back

I always like Poulet for its food and service. It has been consistent across different outlets - Vivocity, Changi Aiport and Chinatown. Always nice to take the roasted chicken and French onion soup.What spoiled my dining experience today was the scratchy upholstery for booth sitting in Vivocity. Pardon my French, but the management should fix it quickly. This shows poor hospitality and no amount of good service and food can compensate the flaw. Minimally, seat your customers at other tables while the upholstery is being fixed. [This review was meant to post in Sep but somewhat, the draft was stuck in TripAdvisor app and my photo of the ugly and worn upholstery cannot be viewed.

Came with family. You can only buy bottled water and no tap water option. Menu looked good. Soup arrived within 2 mins and wasn't hot; the mushroom was very creamy. Speciality chicken decent. Carbona very garlicky.
Many better options at Vivo so won't be back.

No free tap water? So petty. Food is just plain ok but there are plenty of places like that. Food feels like a Tinder date - doesn't look like in the pictures by a long stretch. Won't come back

Succulent roasted chicken with creamy wine sauce and choices for other sauces and dont forget the dessert Tirimasu in a big jug or creme bulee. Other meat dishes like the oxtail stew is good too and salads n soup.Dont miss it in Singaporeüëç‚òùüíù

We had lunch here on a public holiday and the restaurant looked quite empty. We ordered and the food came out not too long after we ordered. Food was good and service was good! The staff were also nice to get a group photo for us. Turns out they had their own instax to take out photo for their Mothers Day promo wall

After one not so pleasant visit sometime ago i thought i would give this outlet another go. Fail. The ledge next to our table was filthy...thick layer of dust. Food was average. The root beer was at best flat! Like still water.I wont be back for quite a while
4
We were shopping and passes by Poulet. The chicken looked good, so we decided to have lunch there. It was delicious. The chicken was moist and tender. There were several choices for "gravy". I had the creamy mushroom, and it was superb! We had free wifi, which was a plus. We ordered some side dishes, which also were very good
3
Poulet seems to reduce their main dishes. Now I only see roast chicken and pork belly on their menu. Good roast chicken unfortunately only three options of sauce that you can choose. Nowadays they charge for tap water :(I will go again for their tiramis

Brought my 2 kids to Poulet on a Sunday. Usually we'd choose cheaper options such as food court but as it's crowed and Poulet has a promotion set meal,we decided to try that instead. No regrets and the simple meal was delicious and the service very good. my daughter accidentally dropped a fork, even before i called for service, 1 of the waitress (shoulder length dyed red hair girl wearing glasses) came by to replace it

I asked for escargot and a tiramisuThroughout the entire lunch, no one offered or asked me if I need water . When I paid at the counter , the cashier had zero smile . It is worst than paying at a fast foodThe tiramisu is average - big portion but don't feel the flavor . Hope Managment will buck u

Poulet is great at, naturally, chicken dishes. The roast chicken is tender and juicy which I enjoy every time. I am always veering towards the one served with white wine mushroom sauce, delicious in my opinion. Service at this outlet is friendly. I do feel that quality slightly differs outlet to outlet.
4
Going there often as it's nearby my office, this restaurant propose a very good roasted chiken, with a very good sauce... pricing is ok, and service is good ( depending on the shifts), nice for a lunch or a quick dinner
4
We don't go anywhere else if we crave for roast chicken, their speciality never fail to please. Our favorite comes with the classic sauce, which is the best if you like cream base sauce. Staff is friendly and prices reasonable.
5
This restaurant offers French Classics at reasonable prices. As the name suggest they specialize in roast chicken in various forms with various accompaniments and sauces. The chicken was tender and delicious, great friendly service and well worth a visit.

We had an amazing dinner here in poulet in july 2014. We took the escargots which was very nice and the chicken with chardonnay sauce which was heavenly good ! Definitely worth the money
4
We tried many items from the menu. You must try the chicken with mushroom sauce which is their main dish.mthe souce is amazing. Suggested also: french fries (big and tasetfull), desserts and pan bagnat. Personnell very efficient and location in BUGIS + is definitely worth having a dinner. 3 of us shared quite a bunch of stuff and the price was around 30S$ per person with soft drinks. Definitely good for us. We'll go again

My first time tried French cuisine. I had the famous roast chicken in mushroom cream sauce. The sauce is rich, nice aroma of mushroom and the chicken is tendered, well-marinated, perfect baked color. But I find the chicken is a little salty and wish there is more mushroom in the sauce :) There was no queue when I went there, I got a table immediately. Staff is attentive, ambience is fine. It was not bad experience but the price, I find, is quite expensive ~ $20 for a dish, water cost separately

Located in a shopping mall for your dining experience. I had the french onion soup to start, it came within 90 seconds, a speed to even put a fast food joint like McDonalds to shame. Clearly the soup was from a catering packet mix, no melted cheese on a slice of toasted french bread, just a handful of croutons thrown in the bowl like you'd get in a caesar salad.The main course was a whole chicken with mash as a side. The mash was more like potato puree. It was far too creamy and buttery for my liking and too smooth. the chicken was tender and moist, but then it should be as they stick it in a bucket of salt water for 24 hours before, so its gonna take some drying out after that anyway. It was flavourless. They go on about the cooking of the chicken, but no mention of where the chickens are from, free range or not? Organic? Country of origin? Grain fed, or cereal fed?....I guess they are cheap nasty chickens from mass produced farms in Thailand is my bet. Overall a poor experience, but its a food court in a shopping mall, so dont expect any bette

Tucked at the corner of Changi airport Terminal 3 cage-like open air restaurant serve French poule. .... It is more Asian to me.The confit was not deep fried enough and it didn't meet up to my expectation, the one I ate at Monmartre, Paris was crispy on the outside and soft succulent and flavorful inside. There is a tomatoe base at the bottom of the escago ?? And no garlic and olive oil. Service was alright

We had dinner at Poulet after our Sentosa adventure. We found the food very tasty. The roast chicken was nice and moist and the cream sauce was delicious. The snails were also well prepared as well as the ox tail dish. The crime br√ªl√©e finished off a beautiful dinner. We found the service was good from one particular staff member but the rest of the staff seemed to just just walk past and did not seem to pay us any attention. We would eat there again.

We went to the Chinatown Point outlet. The whipped potato was good, the rotisserie chicken is the signature dish here. I thought it taste quite good. Was not sure why there were so many bad reviews mentioned earlier. For the prices, I would not fault this restauran
3
The food was good timing of entree appetizer and side dish not good and wait staff poor lacks atmosphere because of the openness of the restaurant to the mall no wine disappointing for a French restauraunt
4
It had a great selection of roast chicken and gravy but order the original one with chardonay mushroom sauce, yum! Deserts are great too - like the banana warm bread pudding :-)

My first dining experience at Poulet was at the Great World city outlet. It was a disappointment. The Poulet Roti was dried up and looks stale. The soup I ordered was lukewarm and I have to return. It came back piping hot after going to the microwave. I was invited to lunch this week at the new Poulet at the Kallang Wave and was hoping that my dining experience will be a better one. It wasn't. The restaurant was quiet at lunch time and service was good coz we have all the attention of the staff. We ordered the Poulet Roti which was better than what I had at Great World City outlet, the Halibut Goujonette, Ratatouille and Pissaladiere were served cold like it was prepared way in advance. We ordered the French onion and cream of mushroom soup and I make it very clear that the soup must be piping hot or I will reject it. The French onion soup came out hot but the cream of mushroom soup was not even lukewarm but in room temperate. So, it was sent to back to the microwave for heat up. The duck salad was the only dish that was good. It was another disappointing meal at Poulet

After the Sentosa island trip we tried to grab some lunch at Vivo City and saw this Poulet restaurant we had not tried before. It turned out to be one of our most favourite restaurant. Good food, extremely friendly waiters and waitresses. Not sure if the ambiance is the same at other Poulet's outlets

Tried the new Poulet outlet at the stadium mall called "wave." The chicken was decent and the sides were ok; however, they refused to serve water. Instead they forced us to buy bottled water. I believe bottled water is environmentally absurd and do not patronize restaurants that make patrons pay for water. I will never go back.

Dinner at Poulet with the family. I love the atmosphere in Poulet; very helpful and friendly waiting staff who were so kind as to get a chair for us to place our belongings when I requested for one. Been here a couple of times; the family who tried the signature chicken were delighted. I decided to give the lamb a try -- it was quite decent. We were too full for desserts, but THE TIRAMISU IS REALLY GOOD HERE. I'd come back anytime for their tiramisu! :

Chanced upon this upcoming French restaurant chain, firstly in the heartlands Bedok Mall and then again in Vivocity.Smallish menu, but superb signature chicken. Fab, consistent creamy sauce with succulent whole chicken. We usually order with the green Salad a Paris, sauteed wild mushrooms and marainated cheery tomatoes served in mason jar. Very more-ish, great value, highl recommended for a casual dinner or family lunch. It's certainly doesn't try to be a snobby or high end restaurant so expect limited, but cheerful service

So i wanted to try something french and went to poulet. The atmosphere is nice,abit crowded but ok. The mashed potato ws very good..highly recomended and da the roasted chicken was great. Thr sauce was a little too rich for me but all in all it was okay. Do try the ice moccha as it is amazin

Poulet at vivocity is not a complete covered restaurant,tucked away at one end of the corner it is an open type of resto with complete visibility for the people in the mall - so wouldn't rate the ambience as that great.Coming to the food,the place serves french cuisine and went for the signature half chicken dish that they had with white mushroom sauce, though the chicken was well done and the mushrooms good - the white sauce did not gell well with the chicken - just my opinion.Menu has limited options on the chicken and they have tried to put in different meat options.Price is on the higher side and wouldn't say a must try place!!

Ordered the signature chicken(half) and the mushroom soup. also the escargot.Mushroom soup was very nice and tasty. Chicken was also juicy and very good tasting. Went on a Friday evening. There was too much people. Table are so close by, no privacy. Would appreciate if the restaurant can space the tables further apart to give people more privacy for dinning and a better experience. In terms of food, perfect. Price, reasonable. The service can improve. Not enough waiter and waitress to serve such large number of people
