Nice cafe set up in a library ! Doing research is always a daunting task for me, get sleepy just after few pages of reading. So this cafe just have the perk I needed, just at the entrance of the library. The staff are always friendly and helpful

Unknown to many, Cafe Galilee makes it's presence known in several national libraries and also, catering services in many government events. I was at a public service event whereby I noticed the food was catering from this company.Most of the snacks were very light, not gerlat. Even the brownie was very light, I usually fear brownies from caterers, as they're usually the commercially produced, super hard and dense/frozen for a long time, brownies. The cheesecake was a cube of cream cheese, over a light cake sponge, no biscuit, graham cracker based. I actually liked the cake base, another modification which helps make these snacks "lighter". The chicken pastry, which is the halal version of the char siew soh/seremban siew pau-style, tasted a bit strange. The pastry smelt and tasted very buttery and the chicken was cooked to taste like char siew.Still, reasonably okay food caterer, for tea snacks for any occasion
