My favourite place for a drink at Orchard. Love their green monsters and take note happy hour is till 7pm.
4
Reddot is one of my favorites, especially when they have IPA on tap. They alternate IPA with English Ale so pick the right months to go when the IPA is on tap! The food from the grill is also very enjoyable
5
And maybe some of the best anywhere. Many award-winners. Even in beer genres I don't like much, their examples are balanced and delicious. Nice setting, too.

Nice restaurant on Dempsey Hill, outdoor space and easy food... good for kids
Burger is ok
The Green Lager is amazing and good
Friendly service and price ok

Came here for company gathering - once for lunch and once for dinner. Ample parking lots available. Breezy and surrounded by nature, it's a short escape from the hustling city life. Lunch menu came in sets and limited ala carte selection. But it's particularly quiet in the noon and less smoky (due to the BBQ) too. Highly recommended for lunch. Had the steak (yummy mash potato), caesar salad, chocolate lava cake (amazing).  Dinner selection was extensive. Ordered the signature pork knuckles, satay, squid and sausage platters and our usual side dishes. Our must order sides include the truffle fries, onion rings, silverfish. But the silverfish was more chewy when we came for dinner, crunchy for lunch. I'd prefer the chewier one. All is good except for their questionable serving speed during lunch which left us somewhat frustrated because it took sooooooooo long when there was only another 2 pairs of customers other than us.

Our first visit to this Dempsey Road bistro which has ample parking in front if you get there before 7 pm, the happy hour also ends at the same time. We sat outside and even at 6 pm there were several corporate groups chewing the fat and chugging beer. We had some finger food and I tried two craft beers on tap, the Czech Pilsner and Kolsch , a Cologne brew. I preferred the latter but must admit that I am not a great fan of craft beers. However, the setting was excellent and the service extremely good, both the ladies who served us had "trainee" badges on

Stumbled onto Red Dot as we were waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant. Had a beer, then came back after dinner. We were a larger group so we got two towers of beer. Both were excellent. The most unusual was the green tower as it is natural, not dyed. Supposedly it's seaweed base makes it green. Who knows for sure. Our non beer drinkers actually liked that one. We had a great time taking pictures at Red Dot with the tower of green beer, and sending it to friends and relatives around the world!

Well, it was wifey’s birthday so we thought of trying another new eatery. Asked to be seated away from the smoking area so we could enjoy the food. Started off with a couple of pints of different brews and I would say that the beer is definitely worth the visit. Here’s where it started to go downhill, fast. The food was decently priced but seriously sorely in need of help. Let’s start with the pork knuckle. Super crispy skin, tried dipping the sauce but it was watery and basically salt and vinegar. The pork knuckle was bland and when we got to the actual meat, it was dry and tough from over cooking. The sauerkraut was sweet and not really appetising too. So..unsalted meat with salted sauce and overcooked. Squid tubes was slathered with also very salty sauce. Doneness was just right for most part but the BBQ wasn’t consistent so there were burnt parts which was just bitter. So the only flavours we got was salty and bitter.Hazelnut crusted cod was another matter. Now the fish was crusted with salt and the mashed potato reeks of truffle. So it was a dish with no other flavours but salty truffles to the point where you couldn’t taste either potato or cod.We had aglio olio pasta and crab fettuccine. Pasta was barely al dente and both dishes tasted the same. Bland chilli. The clams and prawns as well as the crab all got lost in bland chilli. If you can’t take spicy, this is your dish from hell. Just chilli. Not enough salt this time round.The snapper was the only decent dish where we could taste the fish but it wasn’t really interesting since all the other dishes were either too salty or too bland.If you’re planning to go here for drinks in a group, the service is refreshingly good and the beer is to die for. The food however, I would strongly advise you to avoid. I’m not sure what’s going on in the kitchen but the dishes are either way too salty or way too bland. Dishes with chilli are just flavoured with dried flat tasting chilli. Not the full bodied fresh chilli but just flat chilli heat. Quite a let down and I hope it’s just this one visit where the kitchen was sorely lacking. Would really want to give it a higher rating for the service and the beer but the food really saddens me. And another thing, the smoking area is too close to other diners. We ended up rushing off although we wanted a couple more pints but the smoke from the smoking area was blowing into the whole eatery.

Hard to get excited about microbrewery products that fall short of expectations so it's a question of whether you go for the food, the beer or just settle back and enjoy the good company that attended the venue with you. It was a management review meeting and unwinding after the first full day of discussions. Dempsey Hill appears to be the standard haunt of lots of expats. The food is honest without ever challenging the palate but the beer proved to be a point of discussion. Many of the styles were sampled but the biggest disappointment was to be found in the IPA, it seemed to be completely devoid of any hops flavour but it was partially redeemed by the citrus infused product that suited the Singapore environment. Of course, you cannot keep drinking the same beer.....as for that spirulina inspired product.....the less said the bette
5
Didn’t know about Dempsey Hill, what a great place. Had dinner at the bar because it was so full on a Friday night. Food was very good and the beer was different. Some rather interesting flavours. Didn’t try the Green beer, maybe next time I will. I know I will come back and explore the beer menu and Dempsey Hill. Only down side was getting a taxi home, yeah it was Friday night in Singapore just have to expect that
5
Nice food and good ambience. The parking is just outside, they have outdoor seating which is very nice with trees around. The food go for Chicken Fagra, super spicy, also try the green Spirulina beer!
4
Held an outing with colleagues from work. The outdoor area was a great place for socializing with a few drinks and appetizers. Nice relaxed atmosphere as well.
4
Loved the beer, great food and service. I would stay away from lunch time over the weekend when the restaurant was full of families and kids. Nothing wrong with that, by the way it's a great setup for kids parties, but somehow running kids and beer don't mix. I would suggest Friday night , for example, as a much better time to visitLots of parking available right in front. Will definitely return
3
The place is convenient for get-togethers with friends as it is quite central and has ample free parking lots. The ambiance is quite relaxing, the staff generally attentive and polite, and the menu has a decent selection of beer to choose from. The price is quite reasonable as well. For a group of 8 people on a Friday night, we averaged about S$42/pax for food and drinks.
3
Their special brew is a green beer with spirulina as ingredient. It is a light beer taste more like lemonade than beer. The Vegetarian Burger was good, not too soggy or dry, but came with fried rice noodles which is strange but taste good. We came here during mid week & in the early evening, so it wasnt crowded, but as it get later, the place filled up quickly. It was a relaxing ambience surrounded by music and lots of greenery in Dempsey

Brought my friends from australia here to have dinner and drinks. We loved it! Food was fantastic, chargrilled with lovely flavor. Also a tower of that green beer was very good, smooth and did not make you feel bloated even after a few pints.Recommend the sausage platter, squid tubes, wagyu beef grill, satay, lamb...All fantastic. Desserts the flaming creme brulee and choc mousse was great. Live band was very good too! Just a great night out with friends, would come back again and again. Highly recommend.
4
Great beer and chicken wings! Tried the Summer Ale beer and taste was very smooth! The outdoor seating is quite dark. Be careful if you are driving, police road blocks seems to be common at Demsey even on weekday nights, preferably not to drive if you plan to drink. They serve steak, burgers, pasta, etc. Green beer seems to be popular. Free parking right outside the restaurant. Service staff are friendly

I used to come here all the time, mainly for the beer. I stopped drinking in 2013 and so had no reason to go to a microbrewery. Took the family here for Easter brunch after church and we took a hightop table. Water was self service from the 'brunch table' but there were no glasses, no fruits as in the past and no cups for coffee and tea. I asked for some and in about 10 minutes they came with cups, glasses and refilled the coffee and ice tea. I asked for more bread and the waitress took the breadbasket... and did not return. We ordered 2 breakfasts and 2 burgers and fries. I asked again for bread as our kids were famished. Asked again and the bread came 10 minutes later. Almost 45 minutes and just 2 burgers show up. My bride and son split their burgers which was more than each would normally eat and we waited, and waited for the breakfasts. Having finished off the burgers, I told a waitress to cancel my breakfast as I didn't NEED it now and was a bit upset. Our daughter still wanted hers and so we waited. So many waiters taking one-dish-at-a time from the kitchen. Then when you want their attention, they pay NO attention. Almost an hour later, the TWO breakfasts come. I told the waiter I cancelled mine and he put our daughter's breakfast in front of her. Her egg was almost raw! It was their version of eggs benedict. She couldn't eat it so we sent it back. 5 minutes later she had an eatable egg dish. Maybe it was more of a fun place to eat when I was drinking beer? Not now. One other problem, they had a family folk band playing kids songs which was a nice touch for parents with small kids.., except the speaker next to us was just TOO LOUD. We were so happy when they STOPPED. The place was only half filled so it wasn't like a major crush they were fighting. Just poor staff management. Not going back

I was in Singapore for business and one of my vendors suggested we go to RedDot. It is located in the former British military base on Dempsey - it is a converted colonial style small one story building (many restaurants have moved into these buildings). I has a great atmosphere being mostly outside, and is surrounded by good foliage to provide some privacy. They offer a tasting flight of beer which is a great way to try all of their local brews. I settled on their "green" beer - not a St. Patricks day dye job but real green beer - very refreshing and unique. The surprise came with the food. The hot wings use szechuan peppercorns making for a very different flavour. The real treat is the chili crab pizza - never would have thought this would work but is does. All in all a great place for casual dining and eating - I will definitely go back again
3
Make the atmosphere great again! ;) The outdoor seating is nice BUT using Ikea foldable and uncomfy plastic chairs isn't what we liked. The terrible chinese live singer neither. Some beers were sold, service slow. Steaks were ok and fairly priced. There are nicer and more welcoming places.
3
Very good in house band. I didn't care too much for the local brew but the ambience was quite nice. Friendly staff so I will be back but not going to rush.......
4
Although the food is just typical menu, i always order the Honey beer. If you are bold enough, you can even go for the green beer !
5
Not your usual hangout, this brew house at Dempsey Road has some loyal clientele, probably due to its unique points. For one, it is set up in a colonial house built in the last century.The brick stairway leading to the restaurant adds so much flavor to the ambience. Soft lighting and ample table layout is truly relaxing. If not for the crowd noise coming from drinking friends, this can be a romantic setting for a nice dinner date.On another note, RedDot provides a really good list of beer and food that customers can enjoy while listening to a live band. What's unique is that RedDot provides different types of beer brewed right inside their facility. Fresh, cold beer on tap! And served on table top 3-litre dispensers. Flavours aplenty, I was able to sense a hint of peach on our second order. For food, I can recommend what I've tried so far - truffle fries, spicy chicken wings, crispy fish skin (nice crisp and spicy flavor), satay combination (pork, chicken and beef barbecue), margherita pizza and crispy pork belly. The spicy baby squid wasn't bad too. You may want to reserve in advance, as it can get packed especially on Friday nights. Will be back for sure. Perhaps to try their green beer

The RedDot BrewHouse @Dempsey is an old colonial house converted as restaurant. It has indoor and outdoor seating area. Landscaping and the garden arrangements are mind blowing.We visited the place for the department dinner (business dinner). We started with pre- ordered fingerfoods and the tower beers. (We pre-ordered the fingerfoods due to the large size of our group of 25 pax)The food quality and quantity are pretty good. Selection of beers and liquors will make everyone happy. The different coloured- flavoured beers are really nice. Must taste and try the beer varieties. The main courses: there are beef steak varieties, lamb steak, salmon and other seafood varieties for order. Burgers, pork chop, chicken chop etc are also available.Charcoal grill counter is near to the outside seating area and we can see the grilling of beef, lamb etc.Overall an excellent restaurant to visit for the beer lovers and charcoal grilled food lovers.

I went on a Friday as a group. Food wise it's pretty good, nothing overcooked, but portion is pretty big - which is ideal for sharing. Drinks wise, they're ok, I prefer the green one as it is less malty. But that's just me, I'm not a heavy beer drinker. Music is great, the band helped tie the setting and ambiance together well. Would recommend for group outings
1
I took a friend who was visiting from Australia and the entire experience was embarrassing and disappointing. It took three attempts to receive an order of one coffee and an iced tea. Three different juices came before the right one was servers, the coffee took 20 minutes after asking three times! The burger smelt off so my friend didn't eat it (although it was included in the final bill they removed it once we complained) which reminded me the previous time I went one of our party got food poisoning from the fish. A table of 6 had been there before we arrived and although there was no one else in the restaurant (now I know why) it took 45 minute for the staff to clear/clean the table (there were 4 staff at that point doing nothing). It's a beautiful environment but they need new staff and a new chef!Very disappointing...
5
Red Dot is a popular pick for office group outings. There is a ton of seating space in a nicely decorated outdoor area. They have live music on the weekends and the bands are usually quite good. We normally order towers for the table which are the best value for your money. In addition to beer, Red Dot also has a lot of good food options. Only minus is that it can be challenging to get a taxi from this location.
3
We had the rib eye steak! Disgusting.!!!!!!! We like the place but such a long standing establishment should be taking pride in the level of quality of food! You can only take people for fools for so long before they go elsewhere. $33.00 ++......for gristle, I hope you feel ashamed reading this review! My husband and I left saying next time we will come for happy hour, some truffle fries and elsewhere for dinner.
4
Recommended by a friend as they brew their own beer plus the famous green coloured beer which has spirulina. Didnt give that a go due to the colour. Had the Oktoberfest special instead which was a bit too bitter for my liking. But the truffle fries was a great compliment to any drinks.
2
While the food and services are satisfactory, the sound system for the live band was quite a disappointment. While the bands played well and sang well how the lady controlling the sound system was sadly, disappointing.The lead singers sang well by the sound system did them great unjust.The lady controlling the sound should give the lead singers more volume to her vocal (mic)......I and surprised and disappointed that a good night was spoilt by a person that could have done better in balancing the sound system
4
Great place to chill out alfresco and have nice BBQ steak and sausages. Live band on Fri night. Microbrewery with "green" beer. This month special is dragon fruit beer. Nice pizzas as well.
4
The beers are good but not spectacular. Service is probably the best in Singapore. Ambiance is very fresh and greeny. Defintely reccomend this place.
5
Finest micro brewery craft beers in Singapore! Choice out of up to seven home made beers. All tasted very well, but especially liked the IPA and Stout.
Service was polite and fast.
4
Lovely bar in a restored colonial building. you will walk pass a herb garden, before entering a open air seating area. It is a romantic place to go grab a drink, away from the city crowd.Live band available most of the week
3
Went there with work in a rather large group. Great atmosphere with dimmed lights in a green outdoor environment. Food was average and meat was quite hard and fatty, whilst the service easy neither fast nor very reactive. Not the best place food wise but the nice and relaxing atmosphere is a definite plus.
3
RedDot is nicely located on Dempsey Hill in an old military building. The food portions are generous and taste is good overall. Prices are high like for almost everything in Singapore. But what is lacking is the attention to details. The overall impression of the restaurant is a bit old and dusty and there is no one whom seem to take responsibility. The staff that worked there are great and very kind. I kind of felt sorry for them as this place has much more potential if just the owner would take it more to his/her hear. They offer various selection of mainly western food and RedDot is know for brewing it's own beer (which we didn't try though). We went there for Brunch with the family on a Sunday as many activities for kids were supposed to be offered. There were not many guests and again, the RedDot would need a make-over to become a land-Mark again. Certainly on my "Food-Map"
1
Six friends and myself decided to go for a nice dinner before getting messy at ladies night (oi oi) The evening was pleasent until it came to paying the bill and the staff attempted to make us pay for a pint and a pizza that our group did not order. We continuously sent our bill back for revision and the staff repeatedly sent the same bill back, therefore taking us for mugs. Not happy, hence the terrible rating for this not so fine establishment
4
Felt like VIP as we had this clear non obstructive view from the left side of the stage. On the opposite of us was two parties going on. Happening place and it is big enough to hold several gatherings. Prompt service. Romantically drinking under a tree, pretty private drinking place for couples as well.Good band, certainly can improve better
5
I've been coming here for a few years now and absolutely love it, never disappointed! The beer is cool and there's a great atmosphere, even the lighting is great (lanterns hanging from the trees etc). Definitely advise visiting if you enjoy beer towers and beer in general, awesome with a bunch of mates! Friday's are especially fun, with live music and the drinking competition adding that little bit more to a memorable evening - and the fans keep you nice and cool so you can still enjoy the outside vibes I'm Singapore's humidity. Go, drink, enjoy
4
Went here to try the Wagyu steak. It was okay . I was not blown away although my partner enjoyed the beers brewed inside this place/ The place is set inside a restored building. It is so green and open so you feel really comforted with the plants and trees around. They also have grilled food if you opt for that option
3
Nice set up for family. Service a bit slow. Nice activities for kids during the brunch, such as face painting.
Menu is not very attractive, I would recommend a revisit to the chef....
5
awesome place to chill out and have a nice home brew beer. tucked away in dempsey and casual hang out. love the beers here.
4
In the land of Pilsner, RedDot has some decent ale, stout and seasonal brews. We sat out in the garden which is very comfortable . We only drank a couple of beers. Would come back, not too busy lots of couples.
5
We had a wonderful time with our friends at RedDot, Dempsey hill. This place offers amazing ambiance, good service, nice food.
4
Large, attractive and spacious outdoor area including fans. Good beers and yummy food in the lovely area of Dempsey Hill.

There is much to like about this venue. Firstly, even the indoors area feels al fresco. Second, the food options are simple yet effective. Third is the beer. If you are into micro brewing- and one with variety that even offers seasonal beers (without any discernible Seasons) then this could be the place for you. Set in a hilly, fashionable dining area not far from the Botanic Gardens - Dempsey hill is magnet for most food tastes and mid to high price ranges. Red dot is at the lower price range on that spectrum and even offers a happy hour before 7pm. Some of the other features can be viewed as either positive or negative depending on your mood. There is an open air bbq area (smoke gets in your eyes if you are a wee bit close outdoors)There is often a live band. A lady singer on the night we went. She was fine but the music was so loud it was hard to have a conversation amongst the four of us (and we were 'indoors')Service is friendly but a wee bit chaotic. Front of house leadership is not evident. Service (to place orders for food or drinks) is a chore. There is no guarantee that orders are taken correctly- we had two errors on the night and a coffee that failed to show up. Lastly, if you are not into beer, but prefer the fruit of the vines then you may well be disappointed as the wine list is limited, low end sold at high margins.
5
we visited the place on july 30 and we were amazed by the selection of beers not to mention that the place is a brewery itself. we are a bit disappointed by the girl singer on the first set though because we never saw in her the talent in singing but the second set after 10pm rocked the place. special mention to crew Julie for giving us the best service that even if she is very busy she always manage to smile to everybody giving the customers an impression that this bar will always do their best to attend to our needs. she is very fast and delivered our orders hot and fresh. employees like her are worth keeping! overall the visit was a thumbs up! way to go julie!
4
It's a microbrewery with an interesting selection of craft beers. Located at Dempsey Hill. The place has a rather nice ambience. You can either dine in or under the stars and trees, and is accompanied by live bands on various days. The menu - European cuisine with a touch of Asian influence, comes with pretty amazing. I enjoy the pork knuckles and silverfish, and Summer Ale beer. The service is good though a bit slow at times. However it is a great place to chill and catch-up with family and friends. It's a great place away from the usual crowd
5
Just arrived for a late lunch and a few pints! Sat next to the water out front. Served right away. Oatmeal stout is awesome! Ordered the ribs which was great as well. Only a few of us out on the water front. Definitely recommend if you like crafted beer and want to relax and enjoy the boats going by on the Boat Quay
1
I was there on 7th March with my colleagues for lunch. Ordered 3 sets of the 3-course set lunch, and was served by a really pleasant waitress at the start. Then it all went downhill from there.The food took a really long time to be served, and I had to wave frantically to get the attention of the waiters lackadisically fiddling with their phones or engaging in idle talk. When our dishes were served, the plates were covered IN A LAYER OF DUST. When I brought this to the attention of another waiter, his knee-jerk reaction before even looking at the plate was "oh this is the garnish". And when i told him very politely while wiping my finger on the plate that this wasn't garnishing, but DUST, he very aggressively & sarcastically told me, "you want to examine our other plates? I show you" before stomping off! We paid for our bill, and nobody got back to us until we approached the counter, and were then issued with ANOTHER bill all over again.When we were paying for the bill, the rude waiter didn't want to let us have a copy of the receipt either (probably because his name was on it). I didn't pursue the matter as by that time I just wanted to leave the place.Visited for lunch because it was near, never going back again.tl:dr - DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU LIKE EATING DUST
4
Went here for lunch with some friends, easy place, pub food, they have their own beer. Pretty quiet during lunch on a weekday so lots of space to hang out on the patio.
4
Good place for family / corporate and social gathering. Microbrewery with the special green beers. Nice ambience and good BBQ! Must try the BBQ. Have the spicy chicken wings. Warning very spicy spicy! Thursday Jazz band. Fri and Sat is live music.
4
OK plase. Will come bak.Good food. Justin biber has been here to. Øl er godt og det grønne øllet smakte godt og ga helsebot
5
The place is a little dreamland. The service is amazing. Food quality is great. They have a beer tester which is amazing too.... But the best part is the way it is designed...

I have always been very welcomed at Reddot Brewery at Dempsey. The manager, Jan, has always been the most friendly and understanding staff in Reddot.Today, 19 of Feb 2016, me and my boyfriend, we were frequenting Reddot like any other ordinary Friday night. Except that it was raining cats and dogs. I was seated at the outdoors area and the rain was pouring in. But the staff and Jan were really proactive and were really prompt in keeping the rain away from the patrons.The scaffolding at the outdoor area was not the best built. However, the crew was responsive and united to make sure that the customers were not wet under the heavy rain. They braved the rain with smiles to improvise and made sure that the rainy weather didn't affect the dining experience at Reddot. Amidst the rainy weather, they have made my experience at Reddot a phenomenal one, the one with the most smiles.I am sure that I will patronise Reddot even more from here. Top notched service and dedication from the Reddot team at Dempsey
1
Pls do NOT go to this place. The waiters (particularly guy named Jeff) are rude and to top it all one of my friends ordered a mojito and they got virgin mojito. We asked them to change it but they said that they couldnt. To cover their mistake they claimed that it wasnt virgin. What a pathetic experience?!
3
In short, if you want a peaceful or chilled out dining experience I wouldn't recommend it. If you've got kids, go for it, this place seems to double up as a kindergarden anyway.... So I have mixed feeling about this place. I think its beers are some of the best microbrews in Singapore, the food is pretty good too and its pretty good value for money by Singapore standards...But both times I've been here the ambiance has just sucked. The service is also lackluster. On my last visit the place was full of kids, I know its a family friendly restaurant but surely there should be some kinda of cut off, after 7 pm for instance? If not, they should be more upfront about it on their website etc. First time I went here was a Friday night, it was all fine until the Filipino cover/cabaret band started up. The music was so loud we couldn't even hear ourselves think, never mind speak. So we quickly finished up and went to a bar nearby instead. I like live music but come on guys...turn the volume down a bit. Disclaimer: hey y'all I love kids you know but just not in restaurants after 7 pm....I also like Filipino cover bands, just in the right place at the right time at the right volume level :
5
Good, cheap beer at a great location. Sounds good, doesn't it? Thank me once you visit :) I like RedDot a lot. Their beers taste awesome and feel like the result of some elaborate nutty professor experiments - they come in red, green and whatever other colors you can imagine. Try the lime wheat - love it

RedDot Brewhouse is located in the beautiful Dempsey Hill area, not far from Orchard Road. It is situated amongst tall tropical trees & dense foliage which provides a spectacular setting, especially at night when combined with clever lighting and the chorus of cicadas. There is an indoor dinning area and a large alfresco area, perfect for enjoying a drink and/or meal on a warm tropical evening. I have never been in the indoor area but the alfresco area is very pleasant, well laid out with a water feature and taking full advantage of the surrounding vegetation. We went for dinner on a Tuesday evening without making a booking and were seated in the alfresco area & left to peruse the menu. As we were seated outside on a very warm, balmy evening, it would have been perfect to start with some nice, cold beverages so I expected the waitress to return shortly to take drinks orders. Although there were only a few other dinners, we waited for approximately 20 minutes before I eventually called the waitress over to ask if we could order drinks.Our waitress was quite young, seemed inexperienced & appeared not to be fully conversant in English. As such, we ensured we spoke clearly & also pointed to the meals on the menu when placing our orders. Despite this, my wife received Chicken Frago (or something) rather than the Salmon Steak she ordered. This was easily & promptly rectified following discussion with another waiter. All staff were polite & friendly and I believe the minor issues we experienced were due solely to inexperience.The food was good but nothing special
5
Knowing this place mostly for the beer brewed on site from previous visits, I was positively surprised when visiting with my family here on a Sunday around noon. Located close to the botanical gardens (but slightly too far to walk in the midday heat - though it might be fine in the evening), this place has a nice lunch menu & provided kids entertainment (pool/toys for the small ones, "cooking lesson" for the bigger ones). All staff were friendly and attentive & the beer was good as always :
5
Excellent service.
Pleasant outdoor area. Good range of beers and other beverages.
Nice place for a meal.
3
Great atmosphere but lousy service and average food, nothing unexpected for this type of place.
Maybe still succesful after so many years but used to be better taste and managed
4
Taken there by a friend - in a gardenlike neighbourhood - very quiet and relaxing upon a busy day in town.Enjoyed several of the house brewed beers - incl a very "ugly" looking all green beer.Tasted quite nice - actually if you close your eyes you cant taste the "green" :)Enjoyed a few days later also the menu card - very nice (german) sausage platter.Go there and you will not be disappointed .......

I found Reddot Brewhouse a great place to catch up with friends. I went here with a bunch of friends who brought their two young daughters. The girls had a great time as well.Food, loved their salads and their sausages! Beer, the Green Monster was awesome! 3 of us grown ups shared a whole tower of it! Band. When we were there, we chanced upon the performance of a Filipina singer. She is so talented and she definitely knew how to entertain.Overall, we had a really great time! I won't mind going back on my next visit to Singapore
5
Ever since I found this place 6 or 7 years ago, I have become a regular there.What's good? Too many. Perhaps easier to point out the not-so-good, which is ..... smoking section. At times when the place gets too crowded (usually Friday evening), I got to sit close to smoking section.Coming back to the good bits. Excellent bit, indeed. The beer. My favourite is Summer Ale and English Ale. But a few others are very good too. Since all these are freshly brewed in house, you just can't beat that freshness in the beer. I don't bother to go to other microbreweries anymore.The food here are good too. Snacks such as spicy wings, pork belly. Yup. And the grilled food. You must try the lamb rack, squid, and satay
5
We were lucky to get a table quickly even we didn't make any reservation.Every section of the restaurant was full and its pretty obvious that it was a Friday night, people were dancing near the band and rushing for to order their booze.We were advise that food may take a while so the waiter recommended that we order our drinks and food together so that it will not be delayed as they were really crowded.Band was entertaining and they also have fastest drinking game. we were invited to join for free but decided just to watch the show. to our surprise we were given special pricing for our beers during the game, watch out for their night specials.Overall we enjoyed our experience and thank you to Jenny and Jan who took care of us last night

Super slow service - no a/c so your drinks are warm within minutes of hitting the table - very poor quality food - no matter how simple the dish. Undercooked potato wedges, 'home made' tartare sauce super sweet, lacking in texture - looks and tastes like it is straight from a bottle. Salmon full of bones. Avoid the fish and chips - which is watery and undercooked on the inside and caked in a pasty semi-cooked batter on the outside - damp and floury near the fish itself. Staff are completely disinterested - wandering about with the look of someone who just fell out of bed after a rough night. It wasn't just us - the whole dining room is a sea of hands waving in the air trying to get a waiter to serve them. My main course arrived 15 minutes before anyone else's - but with no explanation or warning. A completely hideous experience

Visited RedDot on a recent business trip, both at Dempsey (where we ate) and at Boat Quay (just for beers). The beers are interesting and uniformly tasty. I particularly enjoyed the Oat Stout. The food though struggled to rise above the level of pub grub when we ate at Dempsey so on our subsequent visit in Boat Quay, we just stuck to the beers. Service was good in both locations

First to visit this place last July after attending my best friend's wedding, didn't know that a brewery exists in this hill.With my second visit , decided to seat at the Outdoor area with the whole family. Without asking for it, one of the staff quickly set up a baby chair for my son and later gave him a balloon that made him busy through out the night.Food was good, though it wasnt pricey at all. i suggest that you try their Massive Pork Knuckle, Chili Crab Pizza and the Sausage Platter and few baskets of starters, enough for 5 people to share. The monster green lager is really a big hit, most of the tables were drinking this beer. cant blame them this beer is really refreshing and appears to be healthy.will definitely be back for the Pork Knuckle, Monster Green and friendly service.Cheer

This restaurant is worth the drive out to Dempsey Hill Lovely old world charm and very helpful staff. Food was cooked to perfection and very tasty - seemed to be predominantly western cuisine with some local bites for variety. Amazed by the Live Grill Station that they have at the garden area I decided to get a Rib Eye Steak for my dinner and i can tell you that they have a good portion for a big eater like me.They have good lagers, but my personal favorite was the Summer Ale, sure to quench your thirst after a long day of work.i highly recommend that you book your table in advance, they have a good crowd everyday and might be difficult for your to get a table if you'll just walk in.sure will visit this place again for friendly staff, great food and amazing beer

Nice brewery with al fresco sittings. Food is soso, but they have very good draft homemade beer. Service is quick. Quite pricey.
4
Great setting for a beer and a quiet family dinner. Beers great for something different to a Tiger. Good food to but too much paprika on the fries. Only the service lets it down which is disappointing.
5
I love this microbrewery at dempsey.
There is a good variety to choose from. The jug works out well. The satays are pretty good made here. Love the live band on fridays and Saturdays.

This place one had fresh rolled pizza bases, now they are mass produced frozen things you could get from the supermarket
4
Great place in Dempsey for a drink after work. They are a microbrewery and the place is relaxing and great for outdoor dining.
I enjoyed their Summer Ale. Very light and refreshing.
The pizza, satay, pork knuckle and grilled pork are also very delicious.
4
This place is the right one to have a great beer with friends, The beer is served at right temp and it is different then tiger or heineken..... The brewery offers a good variety of beers and is nice to see from the bar. enjoyed it and so did my best friend as well

How can a place that has so much going for it drop the ball right at the finish line? This has to be one of the best restaurants in Singapore... the location and setting is perfect.. sadly- the entire staff is entirely clueless about how to serve customers. Four of us sat at a table- the waiter came right over.. took a beer order from one guy and walked away..leaving the rest of us sitting there shocked...then- he came back later.. took a beer order from one more person and walked away.. he literally served us in sequence rather than asking all four of us at the same time. The service went downhill from there. Living in Singapore you just come to expect horrible service but this place was over the top. One of our party had his food for at least 30 minutes before the next person received food.. Truly pathetic. The beers were great although insanely overpriced... My advice.. go for happy hour beer and have some food at the bar.. stay as far away as possible from the wait staff

My partner look up Dempsey Hill before we arrived in Singapore so we were interested to see what it was like. There are so many bars and restaurants to choose from. We decided on the RedDot Brewhouse. The food was typical bar style food but of a high quality and they had some very nice beers. I'm not a beer drinker and the young lady recommended a lime beer which was very refreshing as it was very humid. The guy enjoyed all the beers they tried so its worth a visit. The only problem would be getting back as there is not a lot of taxis in this area. Would be advisable if you could book one to pick you up before you go
1
The food was just OK. Music too loud for my sleeping baby. They did turn it down lower upon hearing from us. The poster outside the restaurant says that there are activities for the kids. Turns out that the face painting is an extra cost and other activities too are at extra costs. The self service table has no glasses and I couldn't serve myself drinks. The bite size desserts had also turned soft under the heat. Imagine tiramisu and brownies left outside and not in a chiller. Food took time to be served. Though the restaurant was not full at all. There were other kid stuffs that's free, like balloon twisting. And a waddling pool with balls. But there was only one net for the kids to share.
4
One of the best places to enjoy a chilled beer on a lazy weekend afternoon or weeknight after work. The brewery offers a good variety of beers while the food is only so-so but the all-so relaxing surroundings of the Dempsey area makes up for it. One need not worry about driving or getting back to the town area after a drinking session as the pub can help get you a cab to send you back
5
Great experience! RedDot on Dempsey Road Singapore. Shallum was our waiter and was excellent. The Monster Green Lager Beer was tasty. Food was good. Try the Chicken Farga (crazy spicy) and the Mini Crabs. Would return in a heartbeat.

Good place to hang out with Colleagues after work. Ample space available and not noisy. Green beer is light and refreshing. Food is okay, not outstanding.
4
a friend brought us here and i can say that the place is really awesome. Though i dont really drink, i still enjoyed the night because of the delectable foods they also serve. I dont mind going back here for a good time again.
5
Go-- very nice chill open environment, live music, nice people, great service-- order the wheatgrass green lager.

This gem of a bar and restaurant has its main access up a grand brick set of steps from the carpark, flanked by aromatic plants. It has a covered smarter area and totally open more basic area. The main room is in a converted British Army barracks room, with low ceilings, period features and lots of fans. There is a fish pond where fish laze sleepily and little frogs hide. I have eaten here many times and find the food quality excellent. The steaks and burgers are cooked to order on an outside barbecue. The wagyu rump is particularly good. The ambience, staff and food are all great but of course the number one reason for visiting the RedDot is for the beer. It is brewed on site and is superb. The Summer Ale in my opinion is sublime
4
Right next to Samy's this interesting microbrewery offering open air entertainment, food & interesting beers. We tried the green beer said to have health benefits from the spinula that gives it its color, but our favorite was the summer beer. We didn't try the food as we had a booking elsewhere but it smelt & looked delicious. Definitely a place we'd visit again.
4
Their IPA did not suck and the bartender was super friendly. He was Filipino, and wanted to ask us a lot of questions about the united states. We did not eat--just had one beer and snagged some free wifi. A good place to rest for a moment when touring the town

I have been to this place a few times but this is my first review. We were there with a group of friends on Friday to celebrate. In all my visits there I have found the staff to be helpful and with great service. Of course it gets busy sometimes but they will always come and attend to you. The beers are good and I try all the variety every time I am there. The food is OK, we always seems to order the Pork Belly (nice!). I think it a bit on the expensive side. The band is great and entertains well. She is also accommodating. Last time we were there she let my 3.5 year old sing the Frozen song with her and he loved it. This time around they let 2 of my friends sing 2 songs on the mic. They also have a speed beer drinking competition on Friday. Luckily I was thirsty last week and won the competition. They give you a crown, a trophy glass and a jug of your favorite beer on the house. I was tipsy at the end of the night. Overall a great fuss free place to hang out with your friends, chit chat and listen to some good tunes. Of course you can request the songs that you want to hear. I will recommend this to anyone for a good evening

taken here by my brother who lives nearby when I was staying with him. He was greeted like an old friend by the staff who were very attentive. I loved the green beer - apparently it cures all ills!! There were 5 of us and we drank lots of beer and wine, had a very acceptable meal each (I had the sausage platter which was a very generous portion) and the bill came to less than we thought! The best bit was the music - they had a request singer who was really good, very entertaining and this was one of the best nights of the holiday. A beautiful setting outside and luckily there was a breeze . A perfect evening with famil

Came here for a high school reunion and there were about 20 of us. The beers were mostly ok. The finger food were ok too -pizzas , sausages and chicken wings etc. Not hard to cook these things. But one thing i noticed was how stressed, harried and unfriendly the staff were. When i was at the entrance, i saw staff stressed out and running from place to place. They didn't bother to receive any guests and i had to grab one mid-flight. Then later, another staff thumped our beers on the table and literally ran off without waiting 1 second to check if we needed to order something else or food. How odd. And the place wasn't even half ful

Great lunch venue set in an open door lush atmosphere! The beer is delicious with quite a few varieties on tap all locally brewed. The green beer is unique and two wheat varieties were very refreshing. The food was good and service was fantastic.
4
RedDot has some very good beers on draft. I have not eaten at this establishment so I can not attest to their food, but their beer selection and quality is decent at decent prices with a nice atmosphere.
3
Beer is the main feature here, and you get happy hour discount before 6pm. Food is ok, and you have to wait till 7pm to get something from the grill. The attention from the staff has gone from bad to worse. It was still good when the serving staff were locals. Now they are more keen to check their smartphones.For a non aircon location, hardly a happy hour deal, and less attentive staff, the only good point is the close proximity to the bus stop.
4
Often visit this place to chillax, and my fav beer would be their beer with Spirulina, which is green in color. Over the weekend they have a live band down there, and their food is very nice. It is also a great and relaxing place to countdown for Christmas and new year.

A close friend of mine had his daughter turning 10. We met at Reddot Dempsey to plan this. Wanting a venue that would be sprightly and endearing to the kids, we thought the fantastic setting, ambience and space offered by Reddot Dempsey would be perfect for a saturday afternoon with a plethora of kids party excitement.A huge THANKYOU to Marco (reddot's event manager) for his meticulous planning and fantastic inputs for the day.We were assured all would go well but what transpired on the actual day was overwhelmingly spectacular (& exciting to say the least) !Upon arrving on the venue on the said day, we were way too pleased with the decor, birthday banners, face painting arrangements, baloons and accesory decors. Thanks Jan, as we were told you were instrumental in ensuring that the place looked the way it did. A battalion of 30 excited kids needed no further invitation ! And special thanks to Shalom for being the super clown he was with his magic tricks and bartending artistry. The mocktail session he conducted for the kids was the highlight of the afternoon. With games and quizzes amidst the birthday celebrations, the lively squeals of happy kids, outstanding food arrangements and great craft beer for the few of us adults around, the setting was just perfect for the event and the kids loved it. As did the adults too, who were inspired and very involved in the events of the afternoon.My thanks to the entire Reddot team out there for the fabulous arrangements and warm conduct. I recommend Reddot Dempsey as a choice place for a variety of events and wish each one of you the very best.Along with the kids, you allowed us the priceless gift of feeling one with the kids (even if for just one glorious afternoon)!Cheers, V

The atmosphere was very nice with a live band on Saturday night. The servers are excellent handling the very large crowd. We made the mistake of ordering some starters and then a main. I know that this is a strange comment, but they give you much too much food in the starters and then no one could finish the mains. One of our friends ordered the pasta with bacon, but there was so much grease it was not pleasant. One thing is that the food is very reasonable.They do have their own beers. This brings up something that I found disturbing. They have a green beer that is mixed with Spirolina. They advertise that it is good for the immune system, but that it also cures HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately there is no cure for HIV/AIDS. I think that this sends a wrong and dangerous message
4
Nice ambiance for a lazy afternoon for coffee and beer. There is the outdoor area and the covered area. The only thing is if the afternoon is hot then it is not so pleasant.The night is a very nice place... we go there for beers, not so much of the food. They have their own drafts which is quite a treat for beer lovers.I would go there again
5
Upon walking into this place around at 8pm (friday) in the evening, the atmosphere i felt was great. they are already on festive mood as the restaurant is warmly decorated for Christmas.I was given a copy of the Christmas menu and ordered few dishes for my wife and my kids... My wife was so happy to eat the Turkey Breast served with cranberry sauce which she paired with the fruity Weizen beer. As for me i enjoyed the sumptuous Lamb Rack served with Dijon mustard. though they have few types of beer, i stick with my personal favorite the Summer Ale.We stayed until they started to do the Speed Drinking game which was fun. We called for the bill after the game and the price was cheap, but for what we were getting, the atmoshpere, the beer, the food and the service, it was a very reasonable price to pay and I would definitely go back
4
Went here on a Thursday night. It's good that they accept walk-in customers even though this place is always packed. The place was beautiful and the ambiance was very relaxing. I visited Reddot because my friend recommended the beers. While waiting for my friend, i started the night with a pint of their Summer Ale, smooth and with nice hoppiness beer to quench my thirstThe food, on the other hand, was beautifully prepared and the service was impeccable!It was drizzling that time so a staff assisted me on my way down with an umbrella,  Highly recommended
5
Tried lime flavoured beer with tonnes of food with friends. Good ambience, there were few corporate tables booked and employees were having great times.Crispy Pork belly and Truffle fries were very good. Also tried spicy italian sausage and pork knuckle, very tasty. Good prompt service.Recommended place to have a good time there
5
have to visit this place and try out the green beer - its a must for amy beer lover. I have spent many evening with friends drinking beer and enjoying the river side view.
4
Dempsey Hill area has a great choice of food and the RedDot is an ideal place as a meeting place for a pure dinner drink. It's open air style is great as their seems to be a decent breeze up on the hill.
4
Dropped in for a beer after dinner last night. Great range of micro-beers served in lush tropical surroundings. Good crowd of what appeared to be 'locals' (i.e. not tourist's) and a covers band was playing. A good find for my frequent trips to Singapore.
4
The location is a bit out of the way in the Dempsey Hill area but well worth the trip. The main purpose of our visit was to check out the microbrew but the food turned out to be a really pleasant surprise. Avocado Salad, Baby Spinach Salad, Grilled Squid - all excellent. There were 6 beers on offer and I can speak for three of them. The signature "green" beer is an unusual concoction that includes spirulina, hence the green colour, and claims to have all kinds of interesting health benefits. Worth a try, but the lime wheat was better tasting, especially on a hot day. The English Ale is a nicely balanced brew with toasty malt and nice hops and was my favourite. A sampler is available to taste all the beers on offer. Definitely worth a visit

It's tough to find good beer at most places in singapore. I will happily drink a tiger beer but can only take so much. Red dot has a decent selection of good beers although my only complaint is their IPA is considered seasonal so it's not available throughout most of the year. If you're here on an extended stay invest in a growler. Each refill is about 20 dollars which is not much more than a 6 of the above mentioned tiger. Beyond the beer, the food is consistently good and I've yet to try something that was not good or even great. The pork belly really stands out. The open air atmosphere is excellent on a weekend night (typically live music) or during a family brunch. The service can vary a bit but the bartenders are knowledgable and enjoy talking beer
3
Drinks after work turned into dinner as it was a long day on the job. We ordered many sharing plates and enjoyed all of it. The beer list held great variety and was ample in volume. The food tasted great and the staff were accommodating, friendly and assisted when we needed to put tables together to fit in our group. A local haunt I'll definitely go back with friends & family
4
Called in for a beer with the family and was amazed how good the IPA was. After 10 days in Borneo with only Tiger style beers or stouts this was a great was very welcome indeed. In fact we returned later to eat (not bad) and quoff another IPA
4
So first time here. Rakes a but if you are coming by public transportation. Simplest get off at Orchard Station. Grab a cab. It's $5.  Great old spot. I gave 1 fit food because I didn't eat. Service was good but they kept forgetting me tucked away in a corner but always pleasant.  On to the important stuff. I came for the beer and I am a beer snob and geek. I had 3 pints. Monster of course, lime wheat and the pilsner. I had no complaints about any most are on the lighter side not so much in alcohol but taste. It is a warm climate. I will put my money on the pilsner. Ok so if you are a fan of beer and not Bud and etal give this place a go. We'll worth the trek

we had lunch among the fundonate partners & decided on reddot brewhouse at dempsey. it is convenient, has ample free parking & great ambience & of course has the best value set lunch (S$18pax for 2-course & S$22pax for 3-course, and including drink or coffee as well). i had lunch here several times and did an earlier post great lunch with old friend @ reddot brewhouse dempsey on 19nov2013, so this would be just a quick update.we all took the 2-course set. i had the portobello salad. 2 friends had the bruchetta & the reddot salad. another friend had a melt (lava) cake in place of appetizer. i guess 3 of us were all watching our carbo intake.for the mains, 2 friends had the sirloin steak (which looked pretty good), 1 had the chicken breast. i was deciding between my usual halibut (very good here), the steak (which i do rather well at home) and decided on the chef’s special, the beef stroganoff linguine in the above photo. it was excellent. linguine was al dente, very good, and the sauce was excellent. the beef cut was not an expensive one, so just slightly tough, but overall it was an excellent dish, of good restaurant standard, and with nice alfafa & grape tomato garnish. this was a dish i tried at home once previously (pretty ok), so i wanted to try & get some inspiration.the melt cake was a beauty to behold. i had this the last time. the texture (lava) was excellent. the flavour was good too but probably no better than my lava cake. 1 of my friend was saying he could even come here for lunch if he was dining alone – everything was quite perfect for him. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/03/13/s18pax-set-lunch-reddot-brewhouse-dempsey-on-12mar2014
3
The brewhouse has a collection of different beers, including a green beer. Germans like coming here so the beer worth drinking.The food is usually good, but the service was quite poor. This was the normal Asia experience of one meal being delivered and the waiting 15-20 minutes for the other people to get their food.The restaurant is in an area with many others. It is within walking distance of the Trader's Hotel
4
Located on top of a hill in a cluster of British colonial buildings. It has good atmosphere and good food. It has a brewery. Must try their signature green beer!
4
Everything is good. An excelent place in Dempsey Hill, very nice to dine outside; very good beer and quality dishes.
4
i stayed in this place in december and i order spaghetti my first time in singapore and i say very good , very surprise the place it s nice .
very good
5
Always bring my overseas friends for a try out of the Monster Green Beer. This beer is awesome and do not give hang over the next day. Atmosphere is good n so is the food. BBQ is nice.This a must try place when in Singapore
4
On one of our discover Singapore bike drives we discovered dempsey hill was nostalgic of some places we visited back in 2004 and trying to get to a restaurant which was open late to have dinner found reddot to save us it was a random visit but loved the place and love music was just so required. . Awesome place will visit again 
5
Reddot Brewhouse is our "go to" place to bring our guests who visit Singapore. Relaxed, fun environment with plenty to look at while you wait for your food - which is consistently good! .. Oops not to mention you don't need to wait for the beers as it is served in a snap! Great place if you have little ones, too. Try to get a seat near the pond as it will keep the kids entertained. Love the green beer and the weizen. i suggest that you call them on weekends as this place is always jam-packed.Service is also commendable , with friendly staff taking your order with a smile (not like other place that you need to key in your orders using iPad), you won't go wrong choosing this hidden beer gardenif you are looking for Good Tasting Beers, Good food and Good Service this could be your go to place too !

Went to this bar for the first time at the weekend with a very large party. We left our credit card behind the bar and asked for a tab to be initiated. The live music was great and the food was ok. It was pretty crazy and hectic and was difficult to get served sometimes. We ordered food and drink on our tab for a group of 4 whilst the majority of our group had a separate tab. At the end of the evening we asked for our bill and after checking it we paid up at the desk. The other table settled up and left afterwards. Our taxi arrived and as we were leaving one of the waiters came up and said there was a mistake and we had not been charged for 6 drinks. We felt this was unfair as we had already paid and were sure that our bill of over $200 was correct and no way had we had that many drinks. The manager was called and he was very adamant that we had ordered all the drinks on the extra bill. One of our group said that we had to get our cab but gave the manager his contact details so the matter could be sorted. Suffice to say that the manager was very belligerent and refused our offer to pay half the bill, we felt it was a genuine mistake on behalf of the waiter. We ended up paying the extra $120 but have been left feeling very ripped off and disappointed. Just double check your bill people !!! We will certainly NEVER go back
4
Third visit already. By now, tried most of the beers. Wife loved the Monster Green for the novelty effect. It really is green beer!We love the Truffle Lasagna too. Portion seemed to have reduced in size recently, though.For finger food, we tried the 1st on the menu - which turned out to be spicy chicken wing.Wow. Really not for the faint hearted. Our lips were tingling after that. Spicy hot!But then, never a better reason to down more beers, ya
4
If you have had enough of drinking Tiger beer then this is the place to come. We caught the bus from YMCA ( no.s 7,123 or 174 $1.30) to Dempsey Hill a couple of stops after the Botanic Gardens. We visited on a weekday lunchtime so it was fairly quiet. We had the sample set of 6 beers to start. Our favourites were the Summer ale and the English ale. We also had a sandwich which was very tasty and filling and helped to soak up the beer!. All the beers were excellent and anyone who likes "real ale" should make the effort to visit
5
Red Dot Brewhouse actually a brew their own range of beers, lagers and all sorts of crazy other stuff. When we visited late on Friday night it was absolutely rammed and getting a table for 4 for just a beer was a struggle.Their selection of house brews were tempting and my friend and I settled on a golden number though I cant for the life of me remember the name (!). The girls were still able to get cocktails and other branded beers were available.The atmosphere was carnival like with large groups of friends and work colleagues blowing of steam. You can order massive “pitchers” which have their own tap. Red Dot do have a green beer made with all sorts of organic stuff but it was so busy in here we chose to pay up and leave
5
Lets face it, the claim to fame of this place is its green beer called 'The Green Monster'. That said the beer is fantastic (and brewed on site), and the food and atmosphere are also top notch to boot. Must stop location if visiting Singapore.
5
You must try the Monster Green Beer - amazing. And their other varieties are good too.
Excellent venue.
5
A great place to get out of the busy city and have a perfect beer and some finger food in a nice green and open area. One time there and I will definitely go back there.
4
After two attempts, we finally found Red Dot in the old barracks at Dempsey at the end of our stay and wished we'd been more persistent initially because it was great. The pilsner and English beer was the best we'd come across in Singapore and we tried a lot! Service was ok and the food filled a gap but they came into their own when we got caught in a storm leaving and, no questions asked, we were handed a dry t-shirt and a proper brolly (as there was no hope of finding a taxi). Things like that make an impression. We will be back for more when we return to Singapore
3
Perfect place to come for beer. Green beer, pink beer, whatever flavor beer you want. Service mostly missing, but the garden atmosphere is nice and not too in your face loud so one can actually chat with friends while downing large amounts of brew. Forget the food, just come for the beer
3
Honestly, if this restaurant wasn't so good in terms of food and setting I am not sure they would survive. The service, even by lousy Singapore standards, is virtually no existent. Instead of having a waiter or waitress take care of a table they have a half dozen people running around in total confusion taking orders, delivering food, drink in total disarray. The folks delivering drink don't take the orders so they have no idea who ordered it, the person taking the order is not involved in delivery so they have not idea if it was ever delivered or not... Our entire table had people sitting there with no drink while wait staff wandered around aimlessly. Take some advice managers- have your waiters or waitresses "own" a table, have one person greet the guests, take the orders, deliver to drink, deliver the food.... kind of like a real restaurant..! You will be amazed at how much better things flow
4
After many visits to Boat Quay, I had a new and very enjoyable experience last night at Red Dot Boat Quay. Obviously a very popular place because it was almost full, and it is easy to understand why. Some excellent beer from their own brewery and some very tasty food. Service was fine and a good bar/pub atmosphere plus of course the unique atmosphere and views along Boat Quay.Definitely worth a visit. - for a proper beer or a casual but tasty food experienc

Red Dot Dempsey is one of my fave watering holes. It's tucked away in the greenery along Dempsey/ Holland Road. Love the ambience (they serve set lunches!!) and service. the beer is brewed in-house which guarantees freshness, not to mention affordable. Go for the tower if you have a crowd of alcoholics.The service is not too bad either, i ve nothing to complain so far since i started patronising this place when it first opened doors years ago.I especially like the Czech Pilsner which is my usual, if it's your virgin experience at Red Dot, you may want to be more adventurous and order a beer sampler - 6 or 7 little glasses of different beer, and the order a jug/tower of your preferred one.I remember a drinking buddy of mine who purged a day after he tried the monster green (well he enjoyed the green beer). anyway i guess it depends on the individual, afterall it's made with spirulina.Try the grilled sausages, wings, fries and macadamia ice cream while you're there. Dont bother to order the baby squids though.In fact i am considering holding my engagement party at this place... Let's see what happens then
5
Each time when I am in Singapore, I am visiting Red Dot. I love the place, especially the outdoor area. The beer I like most is the Pilsner - while the green beer looks cool (but is not that great to drink, to my opinion).Highly recommende
4
Walked past in the afternnon and see they made their own beer.. that stuck with me throughout the day and had to go back at night to try some of that great beer.. its a MUST.. they also have nice food there but we just snacked on Satays and rings.. excellent location on Boat Quay as well
5
Tryed their home brewed green beer, and some silverfish beer snacks. Service, food and drinks were very good
3
The Green Beer is awesome. One of my favourite. Must try when here. Foods is so so and nothing special. BBQ is fine. Good salads.
4
When we moved to Singapore, Red Dot was the first place we took the family. We were exhausted from jet lag and it was late on a Tuesday. The atmosphere at Red Dot is gorgeous at night...little white lights, lit up steps leading up to the restaurant, and beautiful landscaping. As far as the food, I have found stellar items (the Pasta Carbonara is by FAR the best I've had) and I have had mediocre items. They are really missing out by not having a kids menu. Maybe that's the atmosphere that they're going for, but I would come more if they did. The beer is good but the wine pours are very small.As a mom, what gives Red Dot four stars for me (versus the three that I would give the food) is the fact that they have the Sunday cooking class for kids. It is run by the chef, KC, who is fabulous with the kids. My children, 7 and 9, have participated twice and loved it both times. Once they made chocolate rolls, the other cupcakes, and each time they were able to bring home enough to serve a party. They get aprons and chef hats to wear and it is just the cutest thing. Overall, it's a beautiful restaurant with good food and efficient staff. It definitely warrants a visit when in the Dempsey Hill area. I've seen a few adult groups having an absolute blast with their green beer towers, and look forward to a no-kid night there soon!To follow our family adventures in Singapore, visit www.sleeplessinsingaporeblog.com

Re-visit here. Beers still very good, nice variety.Food actually better than I expected. Simple fare, sausages good. Could improve the dessert selection (no excuse not to have things like apple cake or carrot cake on the menu; frankly nothing I liked on the limited dessert menu).Don't come expecting great food, but it's not bad. I would tho' suggest they try and improve / "elevate" the food choices. To put this another way, if you don't like home-brewed ales, consider other options, frankly.Service a little slow and "forgetful" (had to ask twice for a couple of things). But not horrific. The "meet & greet" guy was very good. In other words, variable service.Like the outdoor seating. Wish they would put the smokers a little further away (like in Malaysia).The following night I went to Red Dot in Boat Quay. Same, excellent, beers
4
Haa a really nice time here. The food was good and the drinks were good. Loved the lychee mojitos and would definitely recommend it. Went back the next day to try the green beer and it was really good and refreshing and a must-try at least once. Would definitely recommend it. Quite a few of the tables had huge 'cask' of beer on their tables and I would say that they are pretty good value especially during happy hour time as they are $20 cheaper! So go for it

Nice experience in this restaurant, inside one of the thousand green places in Singapore.Nice choose of differente beer type, appetized and meal US style but even selection of fish and meat from the Oriental part of the world. Pasta and pizza still present for the happiness of all tourist and local people

Quite a nice location for an early evening drink, with a good selection of micro-brewed beers. The service in the evening (5pm to 7pm) was very good and quick, but as we were leaving the place was starting to get quite busy. The food offered was average (bar type food), so we moved on to one of the other restaurants in Dempsey. Because the location of the restaurant is surrounded by trees and plantation, beware of the mosquitoes at dusk, several of my colleagues were bitten. Overall, a nice place if you like beer

We ordered 4 mains and 1 pizza at 8.10pm. Our tables were completely empty. We had to request for water and cutlery serveral times before it was given to us. 2 of the mains arrived around 8.40pm. Close to 9pm the other 2 remaining mains arrived. We had to constantly ask when our food was coming because such bad service was not expected from such a big establishment. When the waitress asked if we had any other orders, we said that we were still waiting on a pizza. She later came back and told us that they didn't serve pizza that day. It was a packed Friday. The worst part was that a waiter and waitress were there to take our food orders and neither of them told us that they weren't serving pizza that day. 1. How can the waitress/waiters not know that they were not serving pizzas on that day. 2. None of them bothered or had the courtesy to inform us that they weren't serving pizzas. 3. We had to ask an hour after we ordered for the whereabouts of the pizza. The service is ultimately slow and unresponsive. I would not recommend this place unless you like waiting on your food and paying for gst/tips for such undeserving servers.

Quite nice location at Dempsey Hill, the home brew was quite interesting but beware the small print in the menu. If you buy the 2 or 3 course set the main course is half the size of the a-la-carte main course but the staff avoid telling you this, and it is only mentioned in feint print at the end of the menu if you happen to read that far. The least they could do is train the staff to mention it to customers contemplating the set meal

One of the wrost experience in singapore. We were told to wait for the table for a while when we booked already. Very small table for 6 ppl and the waiter refused to change us to a bigger table. The most terrible moment was when we want to refill the beer , the waiter said i'm busy, we were so pissed by such attitude and very disappointed with this overall experience. The food taste was totally ruined by the teenage waiter

Nice food had the set meal of too courses which was 18 sing which is very cheap and I had sea bass.
The beer they brew green was great and unusual.
Finally had a piece of cheese cake which was very good
Service was attentive.

Sat at bar for 20 mins and couldn't get served... Funny thing was we were there to make a company event booking...

Their beers (especially my favourite Green Monster) is a steal before 6pm. Food is good. Service is prompt. Parking is free. Only downside is probably the mozzies when you sit outdoors but other than that, it is a nice place to chill.

Here over the GP weekend at found this the perfect place to lob for the afternoon and relax with great beers, and snacks to help soak the alcohol ! Great spot outside, right by the river.

The Red Dot Brewery was pretty good, we came across this when looking for somewhere to eat after landing in Singapore, we had a seat right on the river, I was travelling with a work colleague and we were both quiet tired, so wanted something quick and easy as we had an early flight out again the next morning. The beer in unique and tasty, the food is good, the standout would be the pork knuckle which was amazing. The service was a bit slow but the location and views meant we were not too worried. Certainly worth a try if you are looking for more Western Food

I have been a regular at Red Dot for the past 2-3 years and love the owner and his philosophy. The beer continues to be a highlight and the ambience is phenomenal. I love that the owner is one of a few small microbrewers in SG (a VERY hard place to be an innovative entrepreneur...all the other microbrewers are either international chains or financed by rich investors, Ernest is not!). However, the food and service have been degrading for some time now, and it pains me to point this out. I've stopped going there as much anymore, or taking clients or friends there for lunches and dinners.Bottomline: Go for the beer and the ambience; the food and service are deplorable

Red Dot brewhouse at Dempsey is an interesting place that it is both a dining and drinking places. Unfortunately we arrived just past 6pm and there was no longer happy hour, but beer prices are not as ridiculous as hotels, or the breweries along Singapore river. Can still get drunk on the cheap.Have try the best microbreweries, with the signature Green Monster that uses spirulina boasting many health properties. And dinner was RedDot Fish & Chips so so only...  Recommend to try something different then commercial beer..

There is also a location on Boat Quay (33/34) that overlooks the river. The beers here were nice and well made; a nice change from the normal Asian lagers. The service was nice and the prices were in line with Singapore. Realize they offer multiple sizes so if you want to try several varieties, you might want to order the half pints. Did not try the food

We went there as a group of friends to have some beer and food on a Sunday and it was a great relaxing evening with good beer and food. There is a great selection of beers on tap which have been brewed on location in the microbrewery. I personally loved the Lime White Beer, although the coolest looking one was a Green Beer which was very popular. The a la Carte menu was great and we all had different things and were all equally impressed with the food. I had the Seared Tuna as entree, and then the Wagyu Beef as main course.... amazing! The other good thing is that the whole area is less touristy, as many apparently dont bother to venture to this area of town, but they really dont know what they are missing. Aside from the RedDot microbrewery there are many many many other places to eat and drink around Dempsey Hill so coming to this part of town overall is highly recommended for nice Singapore dinner experience

Cozy and quiet place. Foods are good with propmt service , first time to taste the green beer (they say it's health booster) which accomodates the green sorroundings. Free parking , nice spot outside but a little bit of some small insects in the area near the river. Don't worry they have tables inside. Overall good place to dine, chat and relax

Very good cheeseburger. Prices are comparable to most all Singaporean restaurants.

The beer is very good. The food very poor, but suggest just choose very simple food, like sausages. Anything more seems beyond their capabilities. But obviously this is not a "foodie" place. Just go for the beer, it's worth it. Just don't go when hungry...

try the brewmaster salad it well balanced. the beer was delicious and for larger consumption the bear comes in a lighted container.

Red Dot Brewhouse at Dempsey is a must for beer lovers! Beers are delicious and the atmosphere is just great, experience it! They have green beer on tap; the green stuff should strengthen the immune system. It is kind of in the green and a taxi is needed to get there. Great for partying.

Food was good, as was the beer, although not sure about the novelty green stuff which has absolutely no aroma at all and not much taste... according to the tasting notes it eliminates the AIDS virus, which is a brave claim indeed I suspect!!!The service was fine, although the sweets could be missed and once you added all the +++ charges the visit isn't a cheap one

I have been several times to this brew pub mainly because it is located in a lovely area and is a convenient meeting-up point. The beer is also fantastic although the green health beer that claims to ward off AIDS is a bit dubious. Despite being in a gorgeous green location the general feel of this restaurant has declined over the past few years. It used to have an elegant feel to it and was somewhat Balinese in flavour with subtly lit water features and dark wood accents. Now it seems quite tacky and outdoor umbrellas and bright lighting obstruct the once green surroundings. The food has never been good and is over-priced and greasy at best. The service can be good but also can be truly horrible. I had a beer poured onto me by a clumsy waitress who ran off in embarrassment without even an apology. At the end of the night they actually tried to charge me for this beer and I had to speak to the manager to finally (and without any apology!) have it removed. For a cold beer in a nice tropical setting look elsewhere

Great selection of ales and beers and fine view from Boat Quay. I was jet-lagged when I visited and so didn't eat anything apart from nuts but the summer ale was just what I needed. There did seem to be a good selection of light bites however. I certainly hope to visit again on future trips to Singapore

Some friends and I walked by the Red Dot Brewhouse and decided to stop in for a beer as it was a brewhouse and it is always nice to try some different beers.We were taken to a table down the back and given drink menus. The beers were fairly expensive, a good $3 more than surrounding bars. Our orders were taken and after a 15 minute wait our beers finally arrived.After finishing our beers (which were mediocre) we asked for the bill. Onto the bill had been added a service charge of ten percent (for the bad service?!) and also GST, despite there being nothing about this on the drinks menu. Some other bars we had visited in Singapore also added a service charge and gst, but it was clearly stated on the menu.When I queried the service charge and GST the waitress brought out the food menu and showed me that in minuscule writing that gst and a service charge would be added. I asked to see the drinks menu and inspected it, definitely no sign of any extra charges. I said we would not be paying and asked to speak to the manager. He would not back down and left the waitress to extract the money from us. Wanting to get going we ended up paying the full amount. It is the thing that niggled me most during my whole trip in Malaysia and Singapore.Stay away from here, buy a nicer standard beer elsewhere and save yourself money

Just off Holland road, located in the upmarket Dempsey Hill area, Red Dot is a charming little brewhouse. An unpretentious quiet, lazy place with ceiling fans, and a great ambience that promtoes casual comfort. It is like trading painful high-heeled shoes after a long hard day for a pair of soft slippers. It brews alteast 5 types of beer. My favorite is the Summer Ale. The specialty brew is a weird green spirulina beer that seems to be the local favorite. Cheap beer before 6pm and all day on Sunday-half pint 4 SGD, Full pint 7SGD is not bad at all. If you feel like a Black Russian, the bartender will mix one for you. The fiery chicken wings are great, the potato wedges dependable. It does not boast a long food menu-sandwiches, burgers, desserts, great coffee. They usually have a full house during their BBQ evenings, reservations are recommended for large groups. The service suffers at such times but if you are in no rush, sit back and enjoy. Do take the mosquito repellent and be prepared to sweat it out a little-there is no air-conditioning. Since it is very close to Singapore Botanical Gardens, a walk on sunday morning followed by a simple brunch at Red dot, or an afternoon reading a book, lazing, catching up with friends is just the thing to do.They have a more happening, younger, noisier outlet on Boat Quay too

I live close by and have been to this place a couple of times. Service in this restaurant is really bad even by SIngapore standards. The food doesnt arrive at the same time and when it does arrive it is cold and tastless. Great location. Nice for a beer but have that and leave
