Despite booking in advance, no table was laid. After seating me, no one came to me to offer a menu or lay the table and after failing to get their attention I went somewhere else.

Nice atmosphere. Foods are nice but a bit salty for us. Portion not big. But we love the dishes. Will definitely plan a visit again

Just moved to the new GSK Asia House and found this place across the street one time we were out to get coffee. I love their pizza napolitana!

Obscure restaurant, not crowded even on a Friday evening. Food took a while to arrive even though there was no crowd, but overall still satisfied.

The service is nice however the gnocci was so so only... pizza also burnt at the bottom. The only thing that is nice is only tiramisu.

Located at a quiet part of Rochester, it was a really cosy place to have dinner. Felt as though I was having dinner at someone's house. The food served was really good and I would recommend my friends to visit.

Went for lunch with colleagues. Menu is extensive with authentic Italian dishes on offer.We tried pasta, cheese Pizza, drinks and few appetisers and were not disappointed.The pasta in tomato sauce with eggplant and garlic was tasty, cooked to perfection in olive oil. Smoked salmon bruschetta was delicious.Prices a little steep but you expect this in restaurants in this area. Overall a good option

they have very nice thin crust pizza, I ordered Panna ham pizza, didn't appreciate the special taste of Italian traditional raw ham, but I do enjoy the base as it is very crunchy like cookies crust! It's very nicely baked. Tiramisu is quite nice too, the usual moist at the base. I tried the special pasta of the day - Pesto ravioli with butter sauce, I admit the taste is not bad but it's overprice for the little portion..

We had a company lunch at this restaurant for a group of 23. We arrive around 12pm, however the food took more than hour to serve. On top of that, the quality of food was disappointing as well. As you can see from the picture, the wedges were burnt and they can still serve it to us. There's even plastic from salami in the pizza; it was NOT the colon! Overall the lunch was not pleasant and most likely we won't visit here again.

Four of us met there for dinner on a Friday night. The place was not full and quiet, which was great. Service was prompt and staff was very nice. There are many different items to choose from, such as salads, pasta and pizza. Our appetizers were nice, and we all chose different pasta for the main dishes. All of us liked our pasta dish, so now we have to go back to try the pizzas! This place is definitely a good, quiet, no-frills Italian restaurant away from the bustle of the mall nearby
