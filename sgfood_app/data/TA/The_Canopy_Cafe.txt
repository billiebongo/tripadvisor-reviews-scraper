We have been in this nice restaurant yesterday at lunch and is really good!
We had a local fried rice and a dog shell cab salad.
Staff is really friendly and food qualitative!
The view is also great.

Food not really fantastic and pricing on the high side. Rude staff and lousy service. Heard that it was co owed by ex-MP.

This place has so much potential , all wasted. If you want a restaurant that's run just like a hawker center , this might just be the place for you. Good menu but very poor service.

Nice view overlooking the gold course. Food wise, huge selection - Japanese, Western, Spanish (Tapas) and local delights. Service is all right.

Went without any reservation on a Sunday evening at about 5.50pm. Two of us were promptly shown to a table at the side with nice views of the golf course and the city skyline in the background. The place was maybe 20% filled so we had a good seat. Ordered the hokkien prawn mee and penang fried kway teow and the portions were acceptable for the price. Don't expect hawker center prices. Apart from local fare there are japanese food, western and pasta dishes as well. Food was served quickly and tasted good. One bad thing was that you had to pay the bill as soon as all the food was served, hence making it a bit like the usual hawker center service. As it is an outdoor sheltered non-air-condition area there were pesky houseflies buzzing about which can be quite annoying and put off some diners. The view was great, plates were cleared promptly, and the waiter manager also asked on how the food was. Overall is a nice place to dine

Not many places in Singapore where you can get good food at cheap prices and with an awe-inspiring view of the Singapore city skyline at the same time. Love always being able to get a table here. One of the best kept secrets in Singapore.The Penang Fried Kway Teow is good and they serve a unique Johore Fried Bee Hoon

I always enjoyed having my meals here after my golf game as the food is relatively nice and a great view of both golf course and marina bay area. but i had a very bad experience in my latest visit. This is an outdoor cafe situated at a golf course so expected to have golfers that will come here before or after their games. When i came after my game at 11.50am, the set lunch are not available because the set only start selling at 12noon. i didn't know 10 mins makes such a big difference. Maybe their cook only know how to cook set lunches after 12 noon. Secondly, golfers have some drinks and snacks they bring along for golfing. while waiting for my lunch to be cooked, i wanted to eat my small piece of cake measuring 5cm by 1cm but was told by the staff that no outside food and drinks are allowed. i would like to ask the boss of this cafe or the manager of the cafe whether they ever drive more than 80km/hr on a road that only allowed 80km/hr. Will they ask for leniency if they are caught at 81km/hr? If they do, then why they can't be flexible to let customers that have ordered food and drinks to even eat a piece of cake? Don't like the way the staff told me off...... and i don't think there are other cafes in other golf courses that are as strict as The Canopy.After this experience, i will not want to eat here again

Easily accessible if you drive or cycle, the Canopy cafe is on the second level of the Marina Bay golf club run by the NTUC. A great outdoor place to enjoy the Marina Bay skyline whilst enjoying a wide smorgasbord of local Chinese, Japanese and Western fare such as fried KuayTeow, Hokkien Mee, ribeye steak, fish and chips , pastas , teriyaki chicken bento ..

If you want a relaxing atmosphere go to the second level of Marina Bay Golf course at Rhu Cross that overlook the golf course while you savour the well done al dente creamy carbonara of various choices .... the seafood of fresh prawns squid mussel at only S$17.90.Its prawn paste deep fried chicken wings appeared very dry but very juicy soft and well marinated really finger licking good. Coupled with the sea salt grilled fish head the meal is very complete with a beer.The meal amounted to S$95 with very good reminesence of my lovely trip of Grand Canyon West having my lunch enjoying the splendour of such great beauty of nature that is very awesome. Remember to make reservations and ask for the front tables as it overlook the golf course and splendid skyline of the Sands and Flyers Wheels. Good time to go is when the sun is setting as you can view the sunset amidst our beautiful S'pore skyline..... enjoy as I did

This is a great place to unwind after a round of golf or some time at the golf range. There are great views of the course, particularly the 1st round tee box and the putting practice areas.Service is very quick - the entire meal arrived within 10 minutes and the staff were helpful in getting sliced chillis etc. We had the beef hor fun which had a rich, garlicky broth and the noodles were good too. We also ordered the kung bao chicken. It was very good and had a generous portion of chicken, though the dish was a tad on the spicy side.They have focussed on attracting the Japanese golfing crowd so you can find a variety of sakes being offered here as well
