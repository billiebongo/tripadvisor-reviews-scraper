Had mushroom soup (vegetarian), pumpkin soup has chicken broth. Very helpful staff, constantly topped up with cool water. Nice relaxed ambience, even on a potentially busy Sunday lunchtime. Soup lovely, coffee (iced latte) good to. Cool even sitting outside, overhead fans. Enjoyed the calm vibe.
4
The cafe has a quiet ambience and caters a cozy place to small groups of people as well as solo readers. The food is decent and the service is courteous and prompt.
4
A good place to meet for a breakfast meeting. Food prices are reasonable, by Singapore standards. I had very friendly and courteous service too. No blaring background music either. The lounge area by the bookshelves is very inviting too.
4
Enjoyed my breakfast here. It’s called Prosciutto, very light very healthy with poached eggs. However, coffee just average. Nice service and good ambiance though.

I was visiting a friend in Singapore last year and we frequented a local cafe which was amazing and we walked past the Book Cafe almost daily. It looked like it had a great atmosphere so, to change things up a bit we decided to pop in for breakfast. To say it was bad would be an understatement. While the service was friendly and courteous the food and coffee were awful! I'm mean seriously bad to the point where I'm not even sure how to describe it. Suffice to say the only recommendation I have to anyone is to give this place a hard pass... keep walking as there are plenty of other places to get great food and coffee in Singapore
3
A nice ambience with nice enough food... there is nothing outstanding about this place, but nor anything too bad.The lounge area near the books is a sweet place to relax with a decent cup of coffee (once you get served, you might need to smile a few times to get attention). If you are around the area and want a nice meal with a nice coffee in a nice place then this is alright choice
5
This place is great. I usually go for brunch on the weekend because I love their prosciutto. Food is simple yet incredibly tasty. If you used the same ingredients at home, it wouldn't turn out as good. Love their iced lattes served in frosty mugs too
4
Next to M studio hotel .If you are tired of hotel meals then this is a an alternate place for good coffee and breakfast or lunch .Eggs Benedict was my choice and black coffee .Pleasant atmosphere & service with plenty of books.Avoid lunch crowds then you can bring your lab-top haha!
2
We went there on a Sunday and were surprised to find out that one cannot use their laptops indoors during weekends and every day during 12-3pm. This should be on their website because many people are looking for a quiet place to work on their laptops or surf the internet. In fact, we chose to go there after seeing a review online that this was a great place for working on one's laptop. We were very disappointed. Once we got a table, there was a notice in their menu pointing this restriction out. Fair enough, but people should know in advance so they can decide whether to go there or not. Also, the tables are very close to each other, so not very relaxing
4
Coffee was amazing and about the same price as coffee everywhere else I had been to in Singapore.The food options on the menu were a bit sweet... even on the savoury dishes.In saying that though it is just my personal preference and the was food was still good
4
A good place to relax - try the egg-less cheese cake! Good book selection for the whole family to browse.
5
Best Milkshakes I've ever had! Also very quick service, amazing staff and the prices aren't too bad either!
4
This is one of my go-to places for when I need to get some evening work done. Very relaxed environment, nice staff and normally pretty quiet. Plugs for your laptop found everywhere and the menu offers what you'd expect from any decent cafe.
4
The salmon and eggs were quite good. My wife had the eggs hollandaise which she enjoyed as well. As with almost everything in Singapore, it's a little pricy. 2 breakfasts, and 2 cups of coffee for about $43usd.
5
It's located along Mohd Sultan and surrounded by many hotels such as M studio and Four Points by Sheraton. Not easily accessile through MRT. Staff attitude are very impressable. They are attentive and are always ready to assist. There is a mixed of nationalities of staff but they have no problem undertanding english. The portion of dishes is sufficient for asian and the food is up to standard. Go for their specialty coffee. Tell them your customisation and they will do it for you. The cafe itself gives poeple a very comfortable feeling. It's really cosy to have small discussion over some good coffee. Please keep your voulme down though
2
I saw the reviews were quite positive, the staff were very friendly and smiled when they served me. I tried minestrone soup coz I was not very hungry, I was disappointed coz it was very watery and not much ingredients. I should have order the main course instead. Will give it another chance.
4
Very comfortable place to read and relax with good food and drinks. Visited the cafe with different groups of friends and they have enjoyed their visit too. We really love the apple pie that is baked freshly every day. do try it when it's still available
5
A good book grabs & holds your attention from cover to cover. You flip the pages eagerly devouring each word, line, paragraphs not leaving anything unconsumed. When you get closer to the end, it fills you nicely leaving an indelible impression the only a good piece of literature can.That's how the meal was for my wife & I if I had to relate our experience as a book.We'll certainly be back for more. You should too
5
Having had to check out of our hotel and with 7 hours to kill before getting picked up for our flight, I did a quick search to find a coffee shop with comfy lounges for mum and myself to chill out in after we had finished our morning's adventure. And voila ... this little gem popped up in a google search.The atmosphere is brilliant .. only $7 uber trip from the city and the couches are definitely comfortable. Staff are friendly and the food and coffee are more than fine
5
Stumbled on this place by chance and found a cool place for breakfast.It was a Sunday and quite busy.We all had various omelettes and coffees that were excellent.Tea and smoothies good too.Free water and friendly service although a little slow.but no rush as on holiday.Back again in morning
4
Cute place with loads of books and magazines and toys for kids.The family had a super lunch.I unfortunately ordered the wrong food, which may have been excellent to somebody else's palate.All in all a must visit place.
5
Had breakfast here on a weekday morning. We ordered the smoked salmon breakfast dish and the egg Blackstone. Both dishes were delicious and very well priced. The service was incredible!
5
A super little place to come for breakfast or brunch. Very helpful and attentive staff. Wonderful decaf coffee which is very hard to come by in Singapore. Food was good too. We visited more than once.
4
Was staying at Studio M, and while the hotel is average, the food in Book Cafe was awesome! Their eggs are very well done and this place is great for a lazy afternoon & late night dining + reading!
4
Boutique coffee shop / cafe in good location, lots of people using the living room and wifi. Breakfast is good, otherwise meals / drinks are a little pricey
4
The Book Cafe20 Martin RoadThere is a diversified range of reading materials available- several hundred local and foreign books, magazines and newspapers are available.There is wireless Internet access and also electrical power-points. Easy street-side parking right in front of the cafÃ©.Hardly any seats left at 12.15 p.m. on a Sunday. Sat outdoors. Thankfully not noisy and no one was smoking.All-day breakfast.Eggs BlackstoneToasted English muffin + maple bacon (none today so replaced with usual bacon) + grilled tomatoes + baby spinach + poached eggs + hollandaise sauce + rotating potato - goodClassic Cheese BurgerGrilled beef patty + cheese + tomato slices + lettuce + caramelised onions on a toasted burger bun + fries - thick slab of beef patty, nice & juicyCalamansi Iced coffe
4
Came here to study with friends. First I ordered Grilled Chicken Burger which is one of the crowd Favourite. It's nice! The chicken meet is tender. Water is free. Then I connect to their free wifi. The ambience is good Even for having a good chit chat, not so noisy I also like that they have some Shonen Jump comics, novels, magazines. Will come back to try their Tex Me
5
We were only in Singapore for a few days and discovered this little gem. We initially briefly popped in for a takeaway coffee. We were so impressed with the service that we kept coming back for more coffees and eventually a meal. There's so little good coffee in the world today - the coffee here was so much better than franchise coffee and the meals were superb
5
Here are what make it 5-star.1. Excellent ambiance, it's the library and cafe concept with beautiful lighting and interior. Feel homie and comfortable.2. Food are excellent, tasty and price is good too.3. Service staffs are very anticipated and putting efforts to look around, making conversation with guest. Amazing place as it is a step away from our apartment
4
The search for a good coffee in Singapore has been long and arduous but finally Book Cafe produced the goods. This place isn't cheap but its worth every penny. I made the horrible mistake of spending the same amount of money at Starbucks for an undrinkable coffee. I recommend the vanilla latte
5
I absolutely love their breakfast servings and their special morning kick coffee (3 shots of espresso), go figure!
Each to their own but I enjoyed my time in that cafe. :)
5
We were on our last day in Singapore and popped in here for a Brunch and Chat. I love the decor and the setup of the cafe. The Food and Coffee was exceptional and the staff were extremely helpful. Thanks!
5
Great decor, food was really good. A perfect setting for work or socializing. Excellent coffee too. A really great concept for a cafe.
5
Good for breakfast, the cappuccino has unusually great flower art made by an dedicated barista
The Omelette is great as well
4
The food was delicious and the ambiance was great for people who work on the go, or looking for a quiet place to eat and work at the same time.
3
Great food, however $16 for a smallish chicken salad and $12 for a small garden salad is a little over priced
5
Had breakfast here this morning and enjoyed it. Staff were extremely helpful and polite. Food was amazing with the multi grain bread being the best I've had so far. My daughter had the pancakes with banana and berries and described them as light and fluffy with a 8 out of 10.Highly recommend this cafe
5
This cafe was super amazing. We stayed at Studio M across from here and ate there every day. Coffee is more expensive than Perth as I like a big cup, it's called a breakfast cup and it would be the size of a mug maybe slightly bigger but cost over $7 We had breakfast and dinner from her and it was really good. If you eat later you'll skip lunch!! Especially with the French toast with crispy bacon as a side. Delis
3
This cafe has a nice setting with sofa and book shelves of different books for adults and children. The light level was good too.Ordered the smoked salmon brekkie with coffee and they were alright only. One thing that really disappointed me was the presence of numerous mosquitos/small flies. I do appreciate that it's summer time and these are inevitable, but I didn't have similar experience in other air-conditioned resto. Would recommend them to do something on keeping the hygiene of the cafe. My friend's legs and hands were bitten by those insects - a memorable souvenir for the visit I guess(!).
4
Great coffee. Food was OK but not fantastic. Great ambience. I couldn't get the WiFi to work but that might have been me. They did do one thing that I didn't appreciate. On a Saturday morning, the first thing they hit me with is "Sir, you can't move your table once you have sat down." OK. First; I don't know what odd Singaporean custom prompted that but NO! You don't start laying down the law to ME when I walk in your place to give you my business. So management? Take heed. That was REALLY annoying! DON'T DO IT!But other than that staff was really pleasan
3
Nice location, interior, vibe, but really slow service, both in getting coffee and in trying to pay for it.
4
I just love the bangers and mash...still as good. Yes, it can get busy...go there during the evening...and don't forget to get your Logan freeze while you are there too.
4
Great service staff. This was always the place for me to hang out with friends when we were at uni and now I just keep coming back. Just a few steps from my neighbourhood. The staff are always nice and friendly offering good service. Great place to cool down the heat in Singapore
3
I visited for brunch on a Saturday morning. The place wasn't full which was great, if you're looking for a place where you can have a conversation without shouting. At one side of the restaurant, there are couches that were perfect for relaxing with a good book. And books there were aplenty for you to browse with. The service staff were friendly and eager to please. Unfortunately, the food though decent, isn't good enough for me to specially return for it. I had the eggs blackstone (English muffin, spinach, tomatoes, eggs, rosti) and a flat white. The coffee was better than I expected - low in acidity. I was excited about the apple pie based on previous reviews, but it didn't live up to the hype. I prefer a harder crust; the filling had just the right hint of tartness and sweetness. My friend really enjoyed his chicken sandwich which he ordered based on the recommendation of another reviewer. It's a nice place to hang out with friends but if you're a picky eater, it may not live up to your expectations. Free wifi available. Toilet is very clean and orderly
3
Power plugs, free internet, one of the best place in Singapore to work/study. Food average ok. Service nice but lacks training and common sense.We were there last Sunday. We wanted to seat on one of the sofas (best place ever) but the staff told us no seat was available. So we sit at a table, order food, ten we noticed 4-5 seats were empty on sofas. We asked the staff for 30 minutes to move to a sofa, in vain.1. First we were said that the empty seats were used by people in the bathroom. 2. After 15 minutes of absurd waiting, they told us there were people ahead of us in a waiting list. But these people were not at the cafe and they had to contact them.3. After 30 minutes, they changed again of version: this time the seats obviously empty were reserved for the friends of one of the persons sitting.We finished our meal, paid and left..
4
This is a very hip and trendy cafe opposite studio M hotel where we were staying. We ate breakfast there every day and found the service good and the food also. A good selection of food on offer with reasonable prices.Lots of magazines as you would expect around the cafe on selves and plenty to read if you needed too.Great location, would recommend if you are in the area. They are also open till midnight
5
Nice atmosphere. Everyone except me on laptops. Everyone seemed to be working on the weekend- felt guilty that ibwasbjust having breakfast. Books and newspapers to read. Great place to go for breakfast.Had the weekend special Emmenthal Cheese and Lean Bacon Omelette. Nothing great but not bad either. Could have done with more than the one small slice of avocado
4
We choose this place for breakfast. We had seen it the day before and we really like the decorations and athmosphere of the place. a lot of couches, to relax, have a coffee and read. Good for people of they traveling or are on their own. We had breakfast and this was good. I had a yoghurt with Muesli and my husband had French toast. Both were good. As it was to early for coffee we did not try this. It was a nice place and if I come back to Singapore and are in the neighbourhood again I will defenitely go back there
5
We were thrilled to discover this little place. The coffee is excellent, milkshakes are THE BEST we've had, the food is delicious and the staff are extremely polite and helpful. They also have a little area with toys for the children, however it is best to try and keep them entertained with quiet activities as this cafe is a place where many people come to read their books or do work on their laptops. We miss our weekend morning breakfasts here
4
This is an alright place to work or read in. It can get busy - I was here on a weekday afternoon and most seats were filled. The service was perfect, very quickly whisked away to a seat, and the wait staff was very accommodating when I requested for a seat close to a power socket. Throughout my 5 hour visit here, the staff remained attentive, refilling my teapot with hot water etc. The tea they serve here is pricey at $8 per pot as compared to most other places but it is quality tea! Not paying that amount to get a cheap lipton or twg. There is no pressure at all to leave, rather laid back. Would recommend if you do not mind the place getting slightly busy, but I wouldn't travel too much just to get here. Food is nothing to shout about, but as I always say, a cafe should just have good enough coffee and tea, and a good atmosphere!
4
tranquil cafe serving great food in the hustle and bustle that is Singapore. wonderful eclectic selection of home made dishes, probably typically Singaporean but we're new to here. staff were indeed a bit slow, and young, but that made more of an experience
4
First breakfast choice - great food - service a bit slow as very busy! But not in a hurry, it was sunday and so much to read!!! choice of sitting from very relaxed sofas to table service.
4
This place is good for dining, having coffee, and it's even better if you like to read, because there are books and magazines to read inside.
5
My favourite spot to sit, eat and work on free wifi for extended amounts of time. Food is good and service is friendly
5
Lovely place with helpful staff, they even made me a special Cortado coffee and made sure it was how I liked it!
3
Went for a mid-week breakfast with my plus one. Missing flavours of home we tried to find Toby's Estate and ended up here. Coffee was average at best and portions of food are quite small and uninspiring. We ordered the short stack pancakes (should have ordered Mt Everest stack) and Eggs Benedict. I really wish cooked ham would stop being described as "bacon"...but at least the sofas were comfy
3
1. Very Good Ambiance2. Food was not at all exciting3. Limited Menu Options4. Very Very Expensive, we went there for breakfast5. Service was okay, average6. Good collection of books7. Both indoor and outdoor seating available8. Studio M hotel recommended us the cafe saying that they will give 20% discount to those staying in the hotel but the Cafe guys denied and gave only 10
3
Visited the book cafe for the 2nd time, but I would review based on my most recent visiting. I would say that the portion of their food was pretty small for their pricing. I ordered poached eggs that could use a little more hollandaise sauce. However, their service was good. Quite helpful and attentive staffs. :
5
This place was opposite our hotel. Highly recommend. We only managed to get here for breakfast once. The staff were lovely, made us feel very welcome & showed us to the toys for our little one. The milkshakes were delicious!! The food came quickly, it was hot & very tasty. Very reasonably price for Singapore. Will definitely visit again on next trip.
4
Came here for a late lunch today after some experiencing some appalling service at one of the nearby cafes. Book Cafe had much better service, and wasn't quite as noisy - so it was possible to converse in a normal tone. Decent selection of food offerings at reasonable prices. Coffee looked great (with a pretty little design in the froth) but could have been served hotter. I had the cheese burger for the meal which was decent enough, although I thought the fries were lacking in taste. A good vibe in this popular cafe. Worth a visit if you're in the area
4
Came in for a business lunch. The atmosphere is good and the food well prepared. My only complaint was that is was a bit slow and the portions were slightly on the light side. On the whole good though.
4
Looking for a simple lunch, I tried Book Café. The café was full of families with small children and twosomes. Noisy but cheerful. Well looked after by the friendly staff. Good simple food and a great atmosphere with books and magazines available for perusing. Wifi of course. Will visit again
4
We only ate here once.It was across the road from our hotel.They have books and magazines all around the walls that you can read .It was busy when we were there at lunchtime on a Saturday,but we didn't have to wait long for our meal.I had the curried chicken and rice.It was not hot but very tasty and would order this again.My partner had the fish and chips and he also enjoyed his meal. the staff were friendly and attentive coming around often to fill our water glasses
1
Today I attempted to have lunch at this cafe. A little background...I am a single woman out for lunch on a day when the air quality in Singapore is horrible. I arrived at the restaurant and proceeded to the area with sofas and soft chairs. I decided I would sit there even though the sofa had stains on it. It just looked comfortable. A server came running over to me and told me that this area is only for persons sharing. So I went over to a table and was told no, the inside is only available for people sharing. I told her that it is hard to breathe outside. She again said that the inside area is for sharing only. Two things this restaurant should be aware of: firstly, it is sometimes difficult enough for a single person to go out for lunch alone and secondly it is not as though a single person is going to languish the day away at your restaurant. A quick meal and I would have been out of there. So I left, which was embarrassing and went down the street to TCC. What a cute place! I was welcomed with a smile and shown to a table for one inside!!! While there I enjoyed pancakes with beautiful Carmelized banana and fresh berries. While there a couple of families came in as well as two singles. Each one was greeted with a smile and a friendly "table for one". Really happy that I ventured in...I was a little nervous after the disaster at Book Cafe
4
Great menu (but no pastries like muffin or scones, only cake). Selection of tea is great (the lychee coconut tea was lovely!) and service also friendly. Great spot to hide out and chill out. Also has a great selection of free magazines (fashion, interior design, women and mens interests) and eclectic books to browse
5
I was looking for a place to have some breakfast one morning that was in walking distance from my hotel and I came across this place. Being a regular book nerd I simply had to go and check it out, and I must say that my curiousity was adequately rewarded. This little cafe certainly lives up to its name with shelves around the walls full of books, and large posters of the covers of various editions of Lolita up on the wall (I get the feeling that that particular book must be the owner's favourite – not that I have actually read it). They do serve a decent breakfast, and it is not too expensive, considering that it is Singapore. This is certainly one of those places I could spend quite a bit of time inside because it certainly has a really good atmosphere
4
We enjoyed our breakfast at the Book Cafe though mine could have been rather hotter. My wife had the Eggs Benedict with maple bacon and I opted for the Bacon & Chipolata breakfast with an extra of mushrooms. The breakfast cup of flat white coffee was excellent as are the comfortable sofas and array of books and magazines to dip into. Such a nice, relaxing place
4
Great place to sit and chill for a while whilst enjoying a classic paperback, unfortunately the abundance of sockets means that a host of laptops and phones spring up, little glowing screens in otherwise cosy ambient light. That aside apparently the key selling points is that you get no hostile glares for overstaying your welcome, so...Excellent service. Coffee was average at best, and took quite a while to arrive
3
Unlike those new kids on the block, The Book Cafe situated on the corner of Martin Road is a well-known, well-loved hideout for many book lovers, myself included. Throw in free fast-speed Wi-Fi, more than 10 socket plugs peppered around the place and dozens of foreign/local magazines for your reading pleasure and you have a café that is perpetually teeming with diners/readers every day of the week.Take your pick between square tables or lounge sofa seats, put up your feeds and chill-out for a few hours reading, gossiping, sipping a cuppa or whiling the time away people-watching.My fourth visit to the café saw me ordering their Traditional Apple Pie which did not disappoint at all; think soft, chewy, sweet apple bits hidden expertly within a thin, crispy, sugary crust with streaks of chocolate sauce on the side. I didn’t order drinks this time as I came on a full stomach but on my previous visits, their Flat White left quite a good impression on me too
5
We had passed by the Book Cafe on our way somewhere else and it looked so cosy that we decided to stop by the next day for coffee. It is a charming spot, with delightful service, delicious coffee and shelves full of books and magazines that you can read while having coffee/breakfast/lunch/whatever. My sister and I worked our way through a couple of editions of the UK Sunday Times magazine, a rare treat in Singapore. The food looks good and there is a wide choice, but we did not sample any on this occasion
4
Good choice on the menu and well presented dishes complemented by a superbly stocked bar. Impressive wine list to boot!
3
decent selection of food and taste is pretty good but more on the average side. we had the bratwurst which was tasty. It was nice and quiet, perfect for extended stay and reading I suppose. Price range is around $20/pax.
5
Great food with lot of options. The quality of the food was very good. Also enjoyed the ambience and the nice staff. Cost was on the higher side.
5
I loved this place while I was in Singapore. The ambience is really relaxed, they have a great variety of magazines or books that you can just grab and read while you have breakfast.
I specially liked the muesli and the fresh orange juice.
5
This is an excellent local hangout and has some good food. The place sevens mostly snack type foods with excellent prices. The burgers are delicious. It is right opposite the signature m hotel so convenient.
4
Coming from Melbourne, i'm spoiled by the number of coffee shops and the quality of the coffee. The overly sweet coffee sold in most places is ok, but becomes a little sickly after awhile. The Book Cafe ticks all the boxes for it's coffee, food and atmosphere
4
This is our regular hangout so we have been here probably more than 10 times. This is a small but lovely and cozy place with half the restaurant offering sofa seating, and the other half offering regular tables. For those with children who are unable to sit still at regular dining tables, this is a great place for you as it offers the chance to get some decent food while the kids are playing. There are plenty of toys and children's books to keep them entertained and the sofa area has some room for them to totter around.Do note though that this may be more true on a weekday morning as it may get quite busy on weekends. When its busy, it can be a little claustrophobic as its not a very big place.Food is pretty good on the whole, though by and large their breakfast items are of a higher standard compared to the other mains. A slight damper on their coffee quality but I think this is just a personal preference and in any case, they have lots of other drinks to choose from.Service is generally very good and they are very used to dealing with families with young children. I appreciate the fact that when we have our young one with us, they are very careful with where they position hot food, sharp cutlery and that they serve water without charges and always ask if I need children cutlery. This place also has complimentary wi-fi. They have a changing table which is located outside of the male/female toilets so even daddy can change the diapers :)Great for "me time" sessions and you don't even have to lug your book with you. Lots of books and magazines for you to browse while you sip your tea or have your cake. They have books and magazines for a very wide range of ages and in all sorts of genres so most will be able to find something that interests them
5
Our table of six (two young ones) ate there, and boy were we happy afterwards! The kids finished their Asian noodles with deep fried chicken on the side quickly. It looked like a Pho noodle broth with boy choy and beef inside. Our friends had a chicken salad and salmon and soup, which they thoroughly enjoyed. And my wife and I ordered the Eggs Benedict and Mango-Avocado chicken sandwich. They are known for their Egg Breakfasts, and the Eggs Benedict did no disappoint. My sandwich was to die for. The ciabatta bread was so soft, and the chicken to avocado to mango chutney ratio was perfect. It was hot, moist, and flavorful. The salad on the side had the fancy lettuce -- none of that iceberg stuff. There was a to-die-for Asian ginger soy-like dressing on it; it was so good that I broke off pieces of ciabatta bread to soak it up! I also ordered a cappuccino that was nice and dry on its foam and even had latte art on it. The wait staff was very attentive, filling up our waters, bringing food out quickly, and even accommodating our request to move from outdoor seating to indoor seating, where the AC was quite strong. I don't think you're going to find many cafes like this that have a great reading vibe but also sell gourmet food -- even filet mignon. You won't be disappointed you went
4
I was staying at Studio M Hotel, just opposite the Book Cafe. It was Sunday so decided to try out the Cafe and also to chill. The place is nice although not a lot of sofas. The foods are nice, we tried the Apple Pie, Wing Zing and the Schnitzel Chicken Salad. For the drinks, we ordered the Cappuccino, Calamnsi and Almdudler. We chilled for about 4 hours cos the place is really comfortable
5
I am staying at Studio M opposite this cafe and wanted something quick and easy for dinner tonight. I'm so glad I went. I had a caesar salad, but the nice touch was I was able to have it with poached egg and avocado. I was handed a menu when I went in as I wasn't sure if I was going to like the offerings (I am a bit fussy), but there was actually a lot I would have eaten, so I stayed. I was pretty full after my dinner, but was able to get the crumble top cheesecake to take out. I ate it later and it was divine
4
The food was nice and the staff were very attentive. Kids had pancakes and my hubby and I muesli. Tea was teabag in mug. Bizarre pictures of Lolita on wall. Great place to chill out with couches for some quiet time.
4
I was looking at the menu from outside the cafe when the staff walked out, handed me a menu, invited me in with a big smile. I'm sold! Had Lychee coconut tea and pasta, fantastic service and food!
4
This cafe was located across the street from our hotel, Studio M Hotel. The cafe offered a wide variety of menu options so there is something for everyone. They have a ton of books, magazines, and games to keep you occupied.
4
Great value and vibe for the area. Breakfast coffee 3 shoots in big cup was v.good friendly service and plenty of room to hang out and free wifi.
5
Very friendly cafe with free books and magazines to read while you are there. High quality meals and great service + free wifi (still not common provision in Singapore restaurants etc.). Definately worthwhile a (many) visit(s)
5
Came here to hot desk today and have been delighted with the food, service and great wifi. Everyone is very friendly and quality of food is great. Highly recommend the chicken and avocado salad :-) Lovely atmosphere too - will definitely be back!
5
I have been here a few times for breakfast but today decided to have dinner.All food and drinks are in good portion - see attached pictures.Curry chicken - delicious, not too spicy, 3 big pieces of chicken with pilaf rice and papadums.Caesar Salad - portion enough for 2. Chicken breast meat BBQed not boiled. It had a smoky taste which blends so well with the greens, avacado, tomatoes, croutons...yums!Mushroom soup - the picture speaks for itself...great taste, served piping hot!Lemongrass and ginger tea with honey - it comes in a pot and tastes freshly brewed.Garlic bread - nicely toasted with subtle hint of garlic, does not leave you with garlic breath.Verdict: will be back for more
5
Nice book cafÃ© and staff. i really like it for breakfast and brunch. Good cappuccino and cake. If you like cheesecake,try the yolkless! Fresh juice, Pancakes and international breakfast. You can find everything from Burger to pasta, look no bad but i ve never tried. Quite good price, i ll come back when i can
5
I had a few meals here during my recent dtsy st Studio M across the road. Studio M guests are given 20% off at The Book Cafe! There are newspapers, magazines and books to read and a lounge area with sofas and armchairs to relax in; a bit like in 'Friends'.I had breakfasts, evening meals and coffees in there and loved it
4
A great pace for a casual lunch or breakfast. It has a chilled atmosphere - you can take your time - surf the internet, read a book or have a chat with friends and there is no hurry. The range of food was limited but good, including snacks and salads.
5
Great spot fast friendly seating and service, great cover and snacks and breakfast. Power for the laptop and newspapers
5
delicious food , delicious coffee and wonderful service team.tried the breakfast toast with eggs and also the beehon soup yum yum.highly reccomended
5
The Book Café offers breakfast ranging from muesli & banana to eggs of different styles and proper cooked breakfasts. Varieties of coffee are available. They also serve lunch and dinner. Its atmosphere is calm and peaceful mocking a library with bookshelves and comfy sofa sets on one side and tables on the other, also provides outdoor seating. Locals frequent the café as a quiet studying area, business meeting place and ladies gathering point.

I only have three requirements for a cafe purchased green tea - decent tea pot, loose-leaf tea and hot water. At least the tea pot at The Book Cafe was ok. In Singapore, $8 for a green tea is not uncommon. But $8 for a tea bag is ridiculous. I put the bag into the pot, left it for a few minutes and then found that the water was cold. The waitress took the pot away, and returned five minutes later with hot water, and the same tea bag. I requested a new bag and was informed that was not possible. $4.50 for a coffee and $8 for a tea bag suggests that the management do not want to be in the business of serving tea. In that case, just take it off the menu, please.

Tried Turkey sandwich for lunch. It had avocado, egg white, mixed salad with oriental dressing; all on focaccia bread. The order came with choices of soup and beverage. The food was good, atmosphere was splendid, interior was adorned with books and magazines, and service was quite fine. There's outdoor seating (a portion only) for smokers. Price: quite reasonabl

This was located across the road from our hotel and we liked it so much that we ate breakfast here 3 days in a row. Good atmosphere, great food and menu and a great concept with a wide variety of books and magazines to read. The staff are friendly and the food is quick and well priced.

We were seated at the plushy and very comfortable, well-kept booth seats. I believe this place should look really gorgeous at night with the elegant setting and lit lamps. I could totally imagine curling up here with a good book and read the hours away.Their menu consisted of a wide variety of food from different cuisine, rather interesting given that this was a western cafe (there were Asian food available for ordering).I had the Eggs Blackstone set (SGD$16.95) under All-Day-Breakfast section, consisting of English muffins, maple bacon, vegetables, poached eggs and a rosti patty. The English muffins were crispy at the side surprisingly, and the tasty slices of bacon were lean. I stabbed the egg yolk so it flowed over the meat items and rosti, adding some sweet touch to them. The rosti was not very crispy, but the potato flavor was distinctive and rather palatable.*Catherine had the Chicken and Avocado Salad (SGD$15.95) with Wafu dressing on the side - a huge salad consisting of lettuce, tomatoes, tender chicken breast pieces and fresh avocade. The tangy flavor of the wafu dressing gave the crisp-fresh salad a higher notch of deliciousness.For more detailed information and photos, do check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/06/brunch-at-book-cafe.htm

Had breakfast here last week as it was across the road from our hotel. The Shibuya Toast was amazing and the coffee was good too :) The only negative I found was that many people seem to use the café for business meetings which were kinda loud and obnoxious
4
Stayed in SIngapore at Studio M and enjoyed the 'Eggs Blackstone' every day for 5 days - it was so good i never got around to ordering anything else. The staff are very friendly. It's not first class- but for good western style eggs in Singapore it's awesome

On a recommendation tried to go for lunch yesterday. Arrived at noon, less than half tables occupied, but they had closed as "kitchen too messy because of order backlog". Seemed odd so I loitered and they turned others away with same excuse. Returned today with my one year old at 10.30am. Much busier. Eventually they took my order (just coffee and pancakes) but after 45 mins still had nothing so I left. My daughter had been very patient waiting and most other clientele were business people using the place for meetings. Floor was filthy so had to keep child well clear. The odd food that rarely appeared from kitchen looked good but unless this place seriously cleans up and develops some customer service not going back. Try the Common Man cafe next door. Far better

Book cafe has really great smoked salmon and their ambience is perfect for those who wants to relax. Sockets are available there too!
5
had a breakfast & a dinner here & both were excellent. service was friendly but not rushed. nice atmosphere & the food selection was large, well priced & delicious.

They have a good range of herbal teas, and if you're staying at Studio M Hotel you get 20% off the bill.

Best reached by bus, this cafe is a perfect place for book readers or people who want to spend time relaxing on the couch or those who want to work/study/talk. Maybe a bit too noisy for studying, though. It has a collection of books for you who don't bring books here. Atmosphere-wise it's ok. Song choices made it better.

This cafe was located across the road from our hotel so we decided to try it out on our first morning in Singapore.Good menu with lots of options so no trouble deciding on what to have for breakfast.Service was good and prices were reasonable.Coffee was good but my only comment was that if I order a hot coffee I want it to be HOT (not lukewarm).Overall the food was good and a good choice
4
Place is simple, clean, and the elegant that goes with them. Indoor air-conditioned seating goes fast but there is more covered seating outdoors with free electrical outlets. Food (meals and snacks) are pretty good but pricey. Nice to escape to occasionally but too pricey, and touristy for me, to be a regular spot. Servers don't pressure at all, but that also means no one checks-in with you so be prepared to flag someone down for a refill or snacks

Had brunch in this cafe. We ordered Egg Benedict and smoked salmon and Lychee coconut tea in pot. The food was nice , poached eggs were well cooked, smoke salmon was a bit salty but acceptable, harshbrown was just nicely fried with crunchy texture. Egg Benedict (muffin, ham, egg and mini rosti) was yummy. Food portion is not big but just nice for ladies. Tea is special and the packaging is cute. Service wise is good as well but coffee machine was faulty so we did not try their coffee....Overall, a pleasant experience and will be back again

Horrible experience. I requested for a table of 2 indoors but told there was none available. 2 caucasian men who came after us took seats behind us, outdoors as well. After a couple of minutes, a staff went up to them and offered them seats inside. But the 2 men refused. They were offered seats again by 2 other staff which they again refused. While doing so, they did not extend the same to other locals sitting outdoors. Some of whom were clearly bothered and soaking wet from the heat and second hand smoke. I guess they just prefer to serve foreigners who are likely to come to this place once rather than locals who may visit again - or not

This would probably be a cool place to hang out alone, read a little, do a bit of work on your laptop, while also getting some lunch or a drink. There's quite a varied selection of books / magazines. The books are quite random though. The place was packed when I went (Sunday afternoon). Couldn't quite decide whether the cafe's clientele were actually reading though - mostly people seemed to come there with friends to catch up, and the books were good for creating intellectual/comfortable ambience rather than as actual reading material ;
4
Popped in for a takeaway coffee, and while I was waiting I was intrigued by the eclectic collection of books to pick up and read.The coffee was good, using Australian milk, and the ambience was inviting and comfortable.Will make more time next visit to chill out...
4
A relaxing way to spend your weekend. They have a wide choice of magazines (latest editions too) and books.
Staff is generally friendly too.
5
A very tidy, comfortable but intimate restaurant who are serving beautifully breakfast' s, lunches and dinners.
We also enjoyed our regular coffees.
A big thank you to all staff and management.
From happy customers Maureen & Wietse

Good collection of magazines and books, great location, nice couches in a cosy setting (saved for my next visit), delicious food at reasonable prices... which book lover would not want to go there!

I had a great with my friends there chilling on the sofa corner. Food variety is good. Atmosphere is awesome. The staffs are very friendly and serve you well, they made me feel very cozy. Will definitely return to try more of their other food.

A very cosy cafe with good service. however, the food was way below average for the price which I have paid for. my egg bene was so bad. the poached eggs, bacon and the muffin were all overcooked! the strawberry shortcake was bad as well. if only the food is as nice as the place. disappointed
5
So, for a taste of relaxed 'cafe culture' there is no better place than the 'book cafe'.I've been to SIngapore 4 times recently and everytime since finding this place I've been in for breakfast in a really relaxing environment with wonderful food and drink. Coffee tastes really good, but the real gem is the breakfast -> eggs benedict! Highly recommend this relaxing place where you can stop for hours on soft sofas talking with friends and whiling away the time in a place with relaxing ambiance. Note: Saturday and Sunday it does get a bit noiser when families come in and while that's not a bad thing - the volume does increase
5
We found this place as we stayed opposite. We went there for breakfast each morning - recommend pancakes. Went back for lunch one day and had a superb salmon noodle soup. The service was great with plenty of smiles and genuine interested questions. Well worth a visit away from the hectic tourist venues

I heard of the Book Café through a colleague and decided to check it out with a friend on a Sunday morning.Prior to my trip there, I had checked out the website and the food pictures there had looked absolutely scrumptious and drool-worthy. And so I ordered the steak dish to be done medium, along with a cuppa.Much to my disappointment, the steak was not good. It was tough to bite into, for a medium-done steak. The sunny side up wasn't all that runny, in fact I felt it was a little too overlooked for a sunny side up on a brunch dish. As for the fries -- if you even call them fries, because they came in such big and thick pieces, I'm more inclined to call them wedges -- were bland and soggy. Thankfully, my cappuccino was good.Although the servers can be quite nice and recommended some fresh pastries for dessert, I couldn't help noticing that they do not automatically serve, or even offer to serve water to the guests. You have to ask for it, and also ask for a refill.Lastly, the ambience wasn't the best, not if you're looking for a quiet place to read a book. Perhaps it was because I went on a Sunday morning, so there were kids in the place who'd run amok, and trash the toys that were actually there for the kids' entertainment. Not quiet at all, no.So if one doesn't mind kids, I'd say the Book Café is alright for a visit. If you're not keen on screaming toddlers, then don't bother -- not on a weekend, at least

I was introduced to this place by a friend. The cafe has outdoor seating with smoking area and non smoking area. The indoor has a section made like a living room with sofas and bookshelves surrounding it. If you do not want to relax and read a book at the sofa area, there are tables seating as well.We had brunch there and i was delighted to know that they serve all day breakfast. Their selection of food which also includes pasta and some asian dishes and coffee may not be so lip smacking good but are decent, nice and acceptable to our palate. What won me over was also the availability of the power point for people with their laptop and tablet use. It is so easy to lose hours there. There are also a variety of books on the shelves for you to read, just like a mini library. When i went again on a second visit in a late evening, it was apparent that the place was understaffed. But the waitress (and the only one i saw) greeted us with warm smile throughout our stay in the cafe and was attentive to us nonetheless. Excellent service i would say. The place is a little inconvenient as it is not near any MRT station or bustop. The nearest MRT station would be Clarke quay but will take you about half hour of walk at least. The bustop along river valley road has bus services like 195 and 32 but will still take you about 10 minutes of walk before reaching to Martin road where the cafe stood.All in all, i will wanna go back again

Had a lovely breakfast here one morning! Lots of choice from healthy options to cooked breakfast and lovely smoothies

The «Book Cafe» is really a nice place where you can spend long time reading or surfing Internet. The attention is good and nice, nobody looks in the hurry mood of Singapore and the atmosphere is overall warm and pleasant.
5
This place is so chilled, with great coffee, fabulous smoothies and lovely breakfast. Lounge about and read a book or catch up on email while taking a break from the heat. Service excellent. Change table for babies/toddlers and kids books too.
5
Lovely quiet place to enjoy a meal - really good breakfast to meet friends and catchup. Great staff, lovely food and not too badly priced.
2
It is a nice cafe with pleasant atmosphere. Sometimes it is packed with monies and screening babies. The coffe and cakes are good. Other food is really over priced.
4
Nice cosy place to sit down and enjoy reading magazines, sipping coffee and eating desserts. The cafe has a decent selection of food and beverages, and the prices are reasonable. There is a good selection of magazines as well for reading pleasure. The staff are generally friendly and attentive. Will definitely visit again if I'm around the area

we have been coming to this lovely cafe for the past decade. Although there have been service staff turnover over the years, the cafe never fail to understand that regular customers are their reason for their business. You will find e.g. good French toast that has consistently kept its comfort quality and standard. At times, there are service staff who are newly hired and looked inexperienced, but always appear eager to learn and provide good service. The whole cafe manages at zero arrogance. Although this may be a tiny cafe compared to its large hotel competitors or those we strive to expand quickly at the cost of service and quality, the long time manager and his team have been able to retain its core value of what cafe is all about, familiarity, comfort, quality and consistency. Keep it up

Finally I found an Oz style cafe in Sing! Eclectic comfy interior with real character. Brilliant coffee (a real find) great food for b'fast lunch or dinner & live all the books, mags & papers to browse thru. Seating outdoor in shade or indoor on tables or old couches mean I seat to match my mood. Love it
5
The food is very tasty and I especially love the Salmon Noodle Soup. The taste is slightly different than the ones that we can find in a food court, coffee-shop or hawker centre. The price is slightly higher than normal but the dinner set price was worth it for a main meal, a drink and the dessert of the day. The coffee is manually brewed at the counter making it better than quick service cafes like Starbucks and Coffee-Bean where at a push of a button, the coffee is made. Overall, the cafÃ© is cosy, food is great, and the staff are just there to serve you. I would definately go there again
4
Some of the menu items are a little pricey, but the pancakes were worth it. They had that fresh-from-scratch taste and were topped with fresh fruit. The coffee was just as we like it--strong and black. Outdoor seating was ideal for people-watching. A great find for breakfast
5
We stopped in for breakfast and loved the laid-back vibe (plenty of stuff to read), free wifi, and great food as well.

This is more a place to meet than to eat. Food is acceptable but in no way outstanding.
2
was really looking forward to this morning and having just been and tried to have breakfast i am rather upset. brunt bacon and i mean black! the best bit was the toast, i didn't have a coffee as i am trying to stay of it for now. i saw the "French" toast and woauldn't try that either. it is expencive for what it is.they were advertising for staff so that may be a problem. the staff that were there were fast and good but it was 9am. would i go back? sorry no i wouldn't
3
I know it's Singapore and generally the prices are higher than you would expect in Hong Kong or Taipei, but I thought this place was not really worth it. If you need to stop and study for some time, I think it may be a good option since it is quiet and has good seating space, but for a quick break from the heat, there are more reasonable options nearby
4
Nice atmosphere, awesome coffee and good food. We had the turkey & egg white sandwich followed by the pancakes. Asked for no banana with our pancakes. The substitute was 2 grapes and a strawberry. A bit more fruit would have been nice. It all tasted good though. A bit hard to get the waiters attention so be prepared to order at the counter. Free, fast wifi is a plus!Recommended
2
Food and coffee always great here however it can take 29 minutes to order and just as long for the bill to be finalized. My meal took a long time to come out and when I questioned them I was told I just had to wait.. No they couldn't check with the kitchen how long it would be... No apology and no way to speed it up.Come here but expect to be a while
5
This is the place for a quiet coffee/tea or breakfast (all day). Free internet which works well. Plenty of newspapers & magazines to read. Very nice staff & great food. The prices are not cheap but a good coffee in Singapore is relatively expensive, (a bit more than London prices).Inside: air-conditioned with table & chairs or easy chairs or you an sit outside in the shade. No rush or hurry, not noisy & no music. Ideal for a chat amongst friends of to use the internet

The Book Cafe is a delightful haven in Singapore to experience the real artistry of making and presenting cappuccino.One of the Book Cafe's baristas, Ruby, is a true artist in the creation and presentation of probably the most delicious and appealing cappuccino in Singapore.Book Cafe's choice of quality coffee beans also contributes to the flavor and aroma of their cappuccino.An unexpected surprise at the Book Cafe is the availability of dependable Wi-Fi service which allows me to keep my Apple iPhone 4S applications current and backed-up. The manager of Book Cafe, Anthony, is exceptionally helpful with Apple iPhone download queries and I always learn something new about my Apple iPhone 4S when I visit the Book Cafe.The Book Cafe reminds me of the actual coffee shops and cafes of Italy, Germany and France where a visit is a multi-sensory, pleasant experience and my visits rejuvenate me

After hearing a lot of positive things about Book Cafe, and seeing it quite busy on the weekends, I was looking forward to eating there.We dropped by on a lazy Sunday afternoon for some coffee and French toast. After waiting for ages for service, we got our coffee (good), French toast and multi-grain toast.The French toast was awful, barely covered in batter, and very chewy dough.As for the toast, it was literally four pieces of bread warmed in a microwave, served with a single tiny plastic serve of butter and jam. It was horrid.We would have complained and asked for them to be taken back, but we couldn't find a waiter to save ourselves. I was really hoping they would bring more than one single tiny serve of jam, but considering they clearly don't even have a toaster, I figure it would be too much for them.When the bill for $31(!) finally arrived (toast, French toast, coffee, juice), we laughed. What a rip-off.I'm not the type of person to whinge, but there are so many good places nearby, eg: Espessamente, Toby's Estate, Hummerston's, etc., there's no reason why anyone should consider this place.Go elsewhere

This is a great cafe, its one of my favourite in town. Free internet service. Not too expensive to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. Its quiet and away from the maddening crowd and there are couch where one can laze and ease away. Highly recommend this place
