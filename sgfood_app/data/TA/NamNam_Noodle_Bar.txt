In fact I visited this place twice during my stay of ten days. The chicken pho was fantastic . The Vietnamese baggets were crisp and delicious. Service is excellent. The ambience is very friendly. The place is a hot favourite during lunch time at Suntech.

I didn't know a Vietnamese restaurant can have such a nice veg option. Pho vegetarian is pretty good and the prices are reasonable
5
Really enjoyed food. Service good and great choice of inexpensive food.
Tasted delicious and didn't have to wait too long.

I had the beef pho and spring rolls. They were bith very tasty. The spring rolls had prawn and mint leaves along with beansprouts i think. The service was quick and staff very friendly.

I'll give this place 2.75 star.The interior is nice.We ordered Chicken phone and you had to pay extra for herbs/bean sprouts----Why? $5 extra The broth had zero flavor. You had to put much stuff in it just to taste halfway decent.Noodles we're good.Portion size was big.Don't think I'd go back again
4
Pho here is good, the broth is nicely done and the meat is good quality. It gets really busy during lunch and dinner so sometimes there is a wait and the service can be slow, but overall this is a great option for a good bowl of Pho in Orchard area

Order a set meal ,a chicken noodle and sandwich with 2 side orders & 2 drinks.The foods are good , the fried chicken was good ,the same can't be said about the spring roll.The chicken noodle was tasty but the sandwich was good ,hard crunchy bread top yet soft and warm inside.The only short fall was the element of service , compromised service over food with barely enough table space and shortage of staff. Shouldn't always cry wolf with the reason , no staff due to tight labor.. ,think about paying more and you will have enough to turnaround the table and also think about placing the sauces on the micro table to a central location to create that space and to avoid accidence

Came here for lunch this week with some colleagues and opted for the set lunch. Very reasonably priced at around $11, and consisting of some spring rolls, pho and a tea. The spring rolls were tasty but the pho lacked flavour somehow and I've definitely had better, even in Singapore. That said, it's still good value for money just that there could be more taste

Had the sliced beef pho. And imperial rolls. Service was alright. Noodles served very quickly. Beef pho was edible. Not mind blowing. Beef stock wasn't as flavorful as it could have been. Not that generous with the beef and it was too done instead of being a shade over rare. My mistake to not indicate. Serious lack of Thai basil and sliced onions to add that special kick to the soup. An underwhelming experience in my estimation. Give you some context, this dish is so easy to cook at home that you have to try in order to mess it up. I cook it at home regularly. Imperial rolls were freshly cooked. Deep fried but lacking in texture and mouthfeel. These were just meat in a roll deep fried. Other establishments creatively blend in shrimp, glass noodles, Pork and fresh herbs and spices to create an riot of tastes and textures in the mouth. Nam nam can do better with their rolls. Overall an alright experience and ok price given the location in town. But nothing to crow about. Maybe the baguettes are decent. Might try in the future.

The place was very well decorated and had the feel and touch of Vietnam.Food quality was good but it wasn't authentic enough in terms of the taste of the food. Maybe it was attuned to the local Singaporean taste.Service was ok but could be improved further. Cleanliness of place is great and the condiments looks like its been replenished regularly.The quantity of the food was just right and not too huge a helping.But best of all, the place was quiet and my buddies and I could share a good meal together over some reminiscence without raising the bar up on our volume
4
Cannot vouch for the authenticity but the chicken Pho tasted very good. The Bahn mi was not as good, but perfectly fine. There are vegetarian options too.
5
Comparatively not cheap compared to hawker centres. But always good, ordering g is awesome and makes it easy to go to lunch with groups, no need to split the bill.
4
Service is prompt. There are set lunches available. The self-ordering at the counter is fuss free. There is always a line during peak dining hours, so do cater for waiting time. Their salads are generally delicious. The vegetarian spring roll is good too.
3
When they first opened, the food was really tasty. I'm not so sure about it now, it just taste different and flavours aren't as vibrant and interesting as I remembered. I believe they have also recently changed the menu, I much preferred the older menu.
4
if you're after quick and tasty vietnamese food than this is the place. great range of vegetarian options. we ordered veg pho, banh mi and rice paper rolls which were all very good. you order on a piece of paper by ticking off items and pay at the counter. reasonably priced and was filling.
4
We were staying in the fairmont and after a very long journey didn't want to go far. My husband loves Pho so this seems liked a good choice. Great Pho and I had the set meal with pomelo and prawn salad, noodle dish and creme caramel and excellent value. We also shared rice rolls which were also delicious . Beer very expensive but then it is singapore! Very speedy service ( all my courses came at once!) and a fast food place so not romantic etc but certainly good food and very popular.

Was at Suntec Fountain shopping and passed by this outlet which is quite spacious and nicely decorated with charms of Vietnam street scene with a modern twist. Wife was drawn in as she saw that the establishment does not use MSG and charges no restaurant and service charge. We wanted something light and soupy for lunch thus decide to patronage. We were glad we did as we ordered Pho & Banh Mi to share and had crispy imperial rolls as sides. The Pho's broth was really flavorful and Banh Mi's baguettes were toasted lightly to achieve good bite fill. The fillings of Wagyu beef were soft, tender and flavorful. We enjoyed the meal very much and had Vietnamese coffee to end it all. A satisfying meal to recharge for next round of shopping

Went there for lunch after a business meeting in Suntec building. The Pho I order was good, but not as good as my expectation which a bit often eat Pho in vietnam. The place were so busy especially during lunch time, queue too long. However the staff were very nice and helpful. The price wasn't cheap as well.
3
Is a ok place for lunch especially the service is fast. The queue here was crazy and I can't comprehend what so good about this place until my very meal been served. Oh well, the quality of food and beverage is not meeting the price expectation. A lunch set for SGD$9.90 with a cup of coffee / tea, spring roll and the noodle. The set I ordered wasn't brilliant at all. The spring roll was cold and they stick together, the coffee was too much of ice instead of coffee taste? and my chicken noodle soup only noodle but not much chicken. There go my SGD$9.90.A 1 off visit although I work at this area. Well done Nam Nam! You just lost a group of customer

A popular and expanding chain in Singapore. It was our first visit to a Nam Nam after about 6 months. The chain of restaurants has got the pricing right and the fit out is quite cosy and charming . It's family friendly and attracts a mix of locals and expats.Sadly, the food can only be described as average at best. What was once a so-so bowl of pho is now a bowl of rice noodles swimming in a tasteless broth (although you do get some decent slices of beef in it). Maybe we're wrong but we think pho is as much about the broth as every component part of it. If you've had the real deal, you will know that the broth has a deep beef flavour but is also light and non-oily. You usually get a bowl of fresh herbs (basil and mint) and raw bean sprouts on the side. Now this being a restaurant chain in pricey Singapore, we can understand why they don't give you the herbs and bean sprouts on the side. But we think the broth could definitely do with some improvement. We had two bowls of noodles, extra beef balls on the side, the pomelo salad, cold lychee tea and a bottle of water. Our meal totalled S$30 (US$22)

The food is just good. Not many options for vegetarians. The problem is service - very lousy. We waited much too long for our bagette.
4
This is our one of favorite Vietnamese restaurants in town.
Food quality is consistent but very busy place, hence the level of service is not remarkable.
But we really enjoy their flavorful food, but it is not under reasonable price range, unfortunately.
4
I enjoyed lunch there. It cost me just 10.90! Serve was quick then noodle was tasty. To be honest it would have been better if more volume however it is quite value for price
4
Fast, friendly and pho close to what you get in Vietnam. Everything seems fresh and the kids enjoyed the tin cups and video wall.
4
Really enjoyed the food here - nice sticky rolls, great beef pho and crunchy salad. Drinks had lots of herbs in so tasty. Only drawbacks for me was - too much sugar and the tables are very small if you order a few dishes. It was quiet when we were there but I can imagine it would be a bit challenging when full

It is fast, good price, self-order (tick off order slip, pay at cashier, take your own drinks, fork/spoon/chopsticks). Server will serve main dish at your table. Good thing is, they will assign your table number before you pay, so you are guarantee a seat, which unlike typical fastfood restaurant like Mac, KFC, you may end up with a tray of food but no seats. You be spoilt for choices, so many different types rice noodles (in vietnamese named as "Pho"), baguette (various combo stuffing), sweet dessert, side dishes, different spices/sauces on your table. They offer selected breakfast (from $5.90), lunch (from $12.90) and dinner (from $1.90) set which is really good value. They loudly claim " NO MSG" on their menu. I particularly love the baguette with lemongrass+ cream cheese (unfortunately so far, no set meal) which i tried in vietnam HCM..close enough for me to remember that fresh lemongrass aroma! I love their viet coffee served with bamboo straw..a rare find nowadays! My vietnamese friends did commented it is not even close to what they have in HCM, but it is definitely good enough for me

I love Viet food and this restaurant in Singapore serves pretty authentic Viet food. Service wise: Its a semi service kind of restaurant, meaning you will have to order the food at the counter, servers will assign you a table and then you will have to collect your own chopstics, soup spoon, tissues etc. Once you're seated at your table with your chopstics/spoon, the food will be served to you by one of the servers.Quality of food: I would say its very nice Viet food that you would find in Singapore, very close to what you actually find in Vietnam. I ordered for a bowl of Chicken Pho, the famous Viet Rolls and a cup of Viet coffee. Loved it.I've tried the Banh Mi's as well and those are pretty decent as well. I would definitely go there again and try something new next time. Thank

This place was designed to be efficient, and the staff is focused on moving bowls of pho around, period. You pick from a menu, present your order to the cashier, pay and go back to your table. Food comes around quickly. This is a place where every single extra, from wet towels to doggy bags are charged for.But the food is very good. I have been there twice, always noodles, and I hear the banh mi is also very good

I shall do this review to the point. Hope it helps other diners.Service- Self service to order and pay. The 2 servers sometimes are too busy to tell the walk in diners and I see them flagging their order chits to them frantically.Atmosphere- Relaxed and casual. If I were alone, I possibly will be perched on the few high tables and high chairs. Price- Reasonable for town fare. Food- I like the noodles. My friend and myself, holds the personal opinions that the sandwiches should be left only for the adventurous. My friend had the opinion that the noodles are average only

Never been in vietnam but my wife did. So she compared the food with what she ate in Vietnam. And it were all the same.We dined here multiple times and i think more time in the future.For me the food are really delicious and healthy. Rice noodles with beef is our all time favorite. The drinks should be tried for experience and i enjoyed using the bamboo straw. The place is easy to find, near the entrance of the mall and exit of mrt station. I think the cost is just fine for the nice food and drinks.Sometimes you will encounter slow service, but don't hesitate to call the attention of the crew. They will surely assist. Avoid the peak hours if possible.

Nice easy going place for a quick casual meal
Ordering process isn't explained but you pencil in on order form what you want, pay, the food is delivered !
Tasty enough
Reasonable prices

Very nice indeed. Soup was light but tasty, ingredients are fresh, can smell the fragrant of the herbs in the soup. Nice ambience too.
4
This is quite authentic, prices are reasonable but the queue during lunch time is long wait. the food portion is not a lot, quite little.
5
We had lunch here as a couple, and the prices were really good; under Â£5 each for a fabulous bowl of meat and noodles - with a stunning tang to the soup. We were only in Singapore for 4 days, but ate here on at least three occasions; a great find, in the shopping Mall opposite Dhouby Ghaut station

I am Gina visited here at Namnam as our favorite place to eat snacks. Was disappointed just now, we ordered bottled water and we wait for quite sometime, we ask the staff ask us to wait to serve.A bottled water took like how many minutes to be serve, worst part its not busy we proceed to the counter and take it. Your staff very rude and staring at us while eating. We felt so uncomfortable and we leave the place

We had the Saigon Street Favourite value lunch set duo of steamed shrimp tapioca cake and hue shrimp rice cake plus beef/chicken Pho and a choice of Viet coffee lotus tea or bottled water. The Pho tasted good didn't include the usual bean sprouts which I thought is a given with Pho. The tapioca and rice cake was not to our liking/taste. The drinks were also good. I also ordered the cane juice which was I thought was the highlight of my meal

My sister and myself were in Singapore somewhere in middle of January. The set lunch of slice beef looked really enticing on the menu,so we ordered that together with Cny meal if I'm not mistaken prosperity noodles and iced coffee. Both noodles were very tasty loaded with lots of meats and vegetables. The iced coffee drink was refreshingly good,not too sweet. The staff were friendly, very fast and attentive. I still remember one your staff, not sure whether she is One of manager there, recommended us to try prosperity meal,she was humorous and witty. That's delicious meal left me yearning for more two month later. Now, my husband along with 2 kids is here. We ordered the same noodles but sadly this time no prosperity, so we decided to change our menu to pork ball noodles. We also had fresh spring roll, fried roll and together with chicken wings. I was shocked when they bought out both noodles, not only had the portion shrunk to half a bowl, but instead of the nicely presented dish of meats and vegetables, the top of bowl was just scattered with a few of fresh onion. The condiments that came with the noodles were simply pathetic, a few strands of onion,2-3 rings of chili and thinny of lime, so thin you've have trouble to squeeze it to get some juice out. The iced coffee came out packed with ice cube,so at the end you get just about a few tablespoons of actual drink. The staff have change and while the restaurant wasn't half full, we were waiting for staff the clears our table, I guess the next step would be to go the kitchen and get you own food yourself. Sad that lots of businesses start out excellent, then they try to get rich quick and find ways to cut cost at the expense of quality and quantity of their food. Will not be going back to this one!

Bad attitude, Poor Service! I went to suntec last week, The restaurant is not even half occupied @1pm. As usual, was directed straight to the cashier by regular Aunty. When I was browsing thru the menu, one of arrogant n proud cashier which I believe he is one of the manager from the restaurant, give me a rude stare! I placed the order, pay the amount and change was given by him with a arrogant face with no thanks n totally no service at all. I was like a fool standing at the cashier area waiting for my takeaway until, I was approached by one of viet crew to collects takeaway items outside the restaurant. The cashier saw it n I believe there is only me who ordered takeaway. Which he can simply tell me that my food is ready, not untill when I saw some pack food at the sandwich area. I have to walk over again at the cashier area and asked if that's is mine. Overall, the service crew there is not so fine as friendly as before especially the arrogant cashier. If he is the manager of the restaurant, he will need to reflect on himself!
