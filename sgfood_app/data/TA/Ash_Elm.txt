A relaxing ambience, great starters, and a very delicious Tomahawk steak. Be sure to save some room for dessert!

Had breakfast while staying at the Intercontinental Hotel.
Large variety of Asian and Western food ,also prepared on order.
Excellent Quality. Very attentive service.
4
Service was good and food were all good. Order their meat sampler, chicken and kids pasta. Items on menu kind of little and lack of pizza choices.
4
was at ash & elm for a birthday celebration, the food did not disappoint but prices were abit on the high side,
5
Weather its breakfast or dinner, make it a stop. The service continues with the taste of excellence. Lots of choices of great food to enjoy, by a top notch Chef.
3
The steak and pizza were of good quality and fresh. However, service was slow and took us a while to get our food served.
4
2nd time there. Loved the change of champagne to tattinger. Caviar spread and seafood is superb. Downside was the warm meals appeared dropped in standards . Wasn’t impressed with eggplant- was bland. Pork loin had too strong frozen pork taste
5
This is a fine dining place within InterCon Hotel itself on its 1st level. Food quality is great and ambience is superb. I had a steak and it turned out better than expected and I must qualify that I am specifically particular about STEAKS! You forked out good $ for steaks and in return, I am more often than not dissatisfied. But this time at Ash & Elm, I must give them 3 thumbs up for the steak. Son had a pork chop which he said was fantastic, wife sautÃ©ed scallops, daughter lasagne. All turned out fine. Special mention must be given to its desserts. We selected 3 diff types of desserts from its menu and all was wonderful. The breads - wow! Very nice, only problem was the portions given was rather little and if you want more, you gotta pay for it. EVEN THE BUTTER! $4 for some butter?? Fine dining yes, but I reckoned 4 bucks for butter is slightly over the top. Wines are well-stocked, I had a red to go with my steak and it complemented very well. Price is above average but that's to be expected. However, if good food is indeed your lust, I think this place is worth the $. Another positive aspect is the good service and attentive staff. We had a James gentleman to wait us at the table. HE WAS 100/100. Local Chinese guy, well spoken, knowledgeable, and professional at his level. We had two teenage kids who can be hard to please but they all gave him and the food thumbs up too. Conclusion - must try

We went to the Ash & Elm for our anniversary and had an evening meal. The food was wonderful. The staff so attentive and very welcoming. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The prices were excellent for Singapore and as we were staying at the Intercontinental at Middle Road, we enjoyed just having a meal and being able to go back to our room without travelling. A surprise cake was presented to us at the end of our meal which was such a lovely thing to do and very unexpected. I would definitely have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant. The lighting is also very good and the seats and table very comfortable
5
Group of 43 people booked for the Christmas Day buffet lunch which was from 12 until 4pm. Very good value, booked the drinks included option (champagne, wines, beers, soft drinks) and the glasses were constantly topped up . Excellent large selection of food to cover all tastes. As there were several children it was important to choose a good place for them and they were really well catered for. Aswell as having tables they could sit on with their friends, there was a separate room they could use with toys, films, face painting and various other things to occupy them. Thoroughly enjoyed it
4
We had a pleasant lunch. Ash & Elm has a very nice atmosphere. The staff there were very friendly. The dessert spread was amazing! I really loved it!
5
I like this place for breakfast but there are more interesting places to eat nearby in Singapore. Cant fault the food here.
5
Celebrated mum's birthday here. Food was great, but portions could have been bigger... A bit small for the price. Lamb rack was very fat. But overall food and ambience was good.
Complimentary birthday cake was a great way to end the meal!
5
Made a reservation and enquired about birthday cakes but was told they do provide complimentary cakes and even wordings. We also arrived earlier than our booking time and the crew was very attentive to our needs, especially when it comes to taking photos! Thank you Ash & Elm
4
We went as a family of four on the 23/12/17 for dinner. Booked a table @ 7.15 and stayed there till 10pm with complimentary parking from the restaurant. The service staff were very attentive, pleasant and courteous. The food was excellent. The ambience was good for meals with friends and family due to its lighting. However, I would have personally preferred more soothing music otherwise we had to compete with the loud music to be heard. The dessert deserves mention as well. If you have not tried this place, do give it a try
5
Food is generally excellent at ash end elm. The flatbread is tasty although more resembling a pizza than the traditional flatbreads. The meat selection is good but often some items are not available. As mentioned in the title. The souffle is worth every penny. Try it!
4
This was not my first visit to Ash & Elm, but was the first visit for my friends. We were friends who met on our first job 17 years ago, and our excuse for gathering this time (as if we needed one) was to celebrate a birthday.My friends were full of praises. *Ambiance* - We love have the restaurant have little "enclave-like" spots along the wall - perfect gathering spot for groups who will be laughing and yacking away, like us. The lighting made it cosy as well.*Service* - Staff was courteous, knowledgeable and prompt. Our interaction with the sommelier was certainly memorable - he had a lighthearted discussion about wines, and he made good recommendation and had great initiative.*Food* - we polished every plate that was presented to us. We had the "All about beef" sharing plate, and all cuts were done just right. My friends could help but soak up every bit of sauce left on the burratina plate - the balance was spot-on. Grand mariner souffle was another worthy mention - fluffy souffle done just right. The restaurant also surprised my friend with a lovely red velvet cake for her birthday - yums..
4
As we have an amex 50% voucher for main course, we decided to give this place a try. But as its on promotion, there were only 5 food choices and we ordered 4 types out of the 5. The taste of the food is mediocre but we enjoyed the service and the ambience very much
5
the place is nicely done up,. service was very prompt and attentive too. not my first time at ash & elm. was impressed by the food previously and went back again,. grilled meats are great , both the lamb and iberico pork,.seafood pasta was so-so, suggest to give it a miss
5
Ash & Elm in Intercontinental Hotel Bugis is an unlikely place to get excellent continental/ European Vegetarian food.Its a good place to celebrate family events in great ambience.Food is immaculate & matches the great service.A must try are their Flatbreads & Risottos. A huge variety of bread cheese & wine are available for selection . A bit pricey but a place not to be missed
4
Satisfied lunch for mum's birthday celebration. Complimentary cake too. We ordered duck confit & red snapper. Both were delicious!
4
Visitors ash and elm to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Food was pretty good but nothing fantastic. Nice ambience and good service though.
4
Good food with good ambience. The beef was really good, however I was hoping that the sauces would taste better.
5
Wish we had this restaurant in Ireland! So good we went there two evenings. Made all the better by a 20% discount as we were staying in the hotel. The bread basket was the best we’ve ever had. At least 5 types of bread. The filet steak was so tender and to die for. The chips were lovely and the burger very tasty. The pepper sauce was a bit bland if I’m critical. The steak comes with a lovely grilled pepper, sweet corn and a roasted garlic bulb. Excellent

I have a few dinner visits with Ash & Elm. All of which, have inconsistent service quality. I can have a great service crew for one night and the next, I can have a cold and apathetic crew.Nothing to write about those unappreciated diner nights, so let me just review my visit with fantastic crew.The restaurant's ambience and lighting for dinner is very cozy and calming. However, I would always request for bar seats if I am dining with one friend because the tables are so wide, it could pose difficulties in chatting especially with the sound level of music, you might need to raise your voice most of the time.I am fortunate to have Mr John Lai as my server for the night. He is so friendly and pro-active in his service. For example, he would explain what is being served to us, and would tell us to enjoy our meals, compared to other servers who would just put the plates in front of us and walk away. I would only expect myself being treated like this in a food centre, not Ash & Elm.Now with the food. We tried alot of varieties. But what catches our taste buds were a the Rib Eye, with natural jus; the pan seared foie gras; Ash & Elm platter, Lobster Bisque and their signature bread basket with their own version of butter.We had the salmon but it wasn't cooked perfectly. Some parts were overcooked, some were just right on the medium. Definitely will not order it again
5
We had * Ash & Elm Platter - light, well prepared & generous portion for 2*Pumpkin & Bacon Flatbread - cheese suitable for Asian tastes, tasty, great crust & big portion*Braised Beef Cheek - tender & delicious (cooked for 2 days)When ordering our food, we were advised to order dessert later. I was so full after the flatbread! My hubby had the privilege of finishing most of the beef! The manager knows his job well.We were well taken care by the host, James. He perfectly timed the courses of our dinner.My hubby was asked the occasion when he reserved our table. It was for our anniversary. The restaurant surprised us with a delicious chocolate cake
5
Impressive and memorable dinner. We ordered "All about Beef" which consist of Tenderloin, Ribeye n Striploin with side dishes of Asparagus and Seared Foie Gras was wonderful and superb. The complimentary breads and the imported Seaweed Butter really impressive. Unfortunately the Boston Lobster Bisque was too salty and not up to the standard. Beef Tartare quite ok only. Thumbs up for the dessert too "Grand Marnier Souffle". We will be back again
4
My family celebrated my wife's birthday at Ash and Elm. We sat at a nice table for 4 in a nice environment where we can chat and just enjoy the dinner. To our surprise, the service was pretty good. The waiter, James, who served us was very knowledgeable and could explain in such detail on how different steaks are cooked and what we should be looking out for. He was very helpful in suggesting what we should order - too much or too little. Overall, a great dining experience . Thanks to the team. -C. Le
4
Ate here for breakfast for 8 days as part of the room package. Sadly, food was the same every day with only a dish or two that changes every other day. Quality and taste were excellent though, and service was fast even if the restaurant has reached full capacity
4
We dined at Ash & Elm during our stay at the Intercontinental and had fantastic steaks, which were perfectly cooked accompanied by great sauces.The only reason we're not giving 5 out of 5 is we believe some of the sides were a bit pricey for the portions.Otherwise, we would certainly recommend Ash & Elm for a special dinner
4
Food was good but gets cold easily for the steak. No free parking unless you spend > $150. Will be good if salad is provided with the meat platter. Limited kids food. Sauce is average.
4
Whilst I much prefer quality over quantity, 3 scallops for a main course and not much to accompany Is what you would expect for a starter. Having said that, food overall and service was good.
5
The food was great, staff was very friendly and attentive. And with a reasonable pricing, this place is definitely recommended for a date or family gathering!
4
Went Ash & Elm to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday and they kindly gave us a complimentary cake which was really sweet of them. Service is awesome and food is tasty as well!
4
interesting and nice food, especially the salad and starters. presention is good too. however price is on high side. location is superd, minutes walk from bugis mrt.
4
We ordered a All about Beef platter and Seafood linguine. Food and sauces are on the salty side. Beef is done perfectly to our preference. Linguine is topped with generous seafood. Had the chocolate rum dessert. Quite yummy but Portion too small. Wanted to order more but the server told us the portion is more than sufficient for 2 adult and 1 toddler. In the end, we left half filled. Highly recommend the beef! Lovely ambience but music a bit too loud
4
I had Sunday brunch at Ash & Elm with a group of friends and really enjoyed it. Like most Sunday brunches in Singapore, it came with free flowing champagne, a wonderful array of seafood, cheeses, meats, roasts, sashimi, salads, desserts and then some. But this one has caviar. I love caviar and rarely get the chance to eat it, so the price was totally worth it. We had two very young kids with us who were given a cupcake decorating experience by one of the chefs in an adjacent room. What a great idea
5
Been here a few times already, and the steak just seems to get better each time. Juicy and succulent meat, rich and packed with flavour. Itâ€™s certainly on the pricey side but a wonderful experience so still a great place for special occasions. Food , service, decor, ambience, this place ticks all the right boxes.
5
all the food we ordered were perfect. none of the dishes disappoint. the service by the team on a friday night was top notch too. will definitely be back to try more items on the menu. definitely a great choice for a special celebration or date night
5
Celebrated son's birthday with a steak dinner. The menu featured sharing options including a 0.9 kg tomahawk but we took the off-menu offer of a 0.5 kg meat-only beef rib. It cost 40% less, was very flavourful and oh so tender. More important, the manageable portion gave us capacity to enjoy side orders of soups, grilled octopus, flat bread, moussaka and crab cakes. None disappointed. Each was perfectly cooked, well presented and delicious! Service was excellent - on arrival we received a warm reception which made us feel really welcome. We were assigned booth seating which was cosy and private. Wait staff were engaging, knowledgeable, and confident enough to suggest sufficient orders to avoid wastage. Son received a complimentary birthday cake which was presented with song in 3-part harmony!Thank you Ash & Elm for the wonderful dining experience!
5
Am impressed with the level of service and patience of the staff. Food was excellent. We had the steak sharing platter which is great for a first time. Lets you know which to have the next time. Will return!
5
Food was awesome, wide spread of selection from the buffet tray and service staff are polite and attentive
4
Ambience and interior was great. Celebrated a friend's birthday and the chef and waitress very kindly helped put together a cake even though we didn't ask
3
Good rating rather than very good or averageSeafood station. Lobster was great. Oysters was ok. Crabs so so and Prawns were not ok which was a huge disappointment because that is baseline. . Anyone got to get prawns right Sashimi : excellent. Freshest tako I hv ever eatenCooked meals : good n nicely portions to prevent wastage . Love the scallops , ravioliWish for more vegs.Superstars : caviar and cheese station. Wonderful service.I'm still in search for best Sunday brunch

Reservation was made through Intercon's A&E website. Service was polite and attentive from the entire team. However, seems like the restaurant had missed my special req. "celebrating husband's big 30th birthday".Service was impressive from beginning up till dessert. While their food, are as good as expected from a hotel in a known hotel. I had anticipated the restaurant to write a 'happy birthday' greeting on my husband's dessert plate but sadly, nothing was done. I had not reminded the restaurant whilst having dinner, as my hubby doesn't exactly like the attention. However, it will greatly be appreciated and adds something to our night. For spending approx. $100/pax, asking for such favor cost nothing.I imagine direct dining reservation would be prioritized on requests. If I had known it'll be missed, I might as well take my hubby for a birthday dinner elsewhere :

Nestled in Intercontinental Singapore within the bustling district of Bugis, this conveniently located restaurant is sure to please you. Besides the lovely interior decor and spacious setup, the menu has a wide variety of offerings, from soups and salads to flatbreads and steaks. I had the grilled octopus and lobster bisque to start, which were really good. For the mains, I had the braised beef cheeks and pan seared scallops, and they were divine. To finish off, be sure to try the chocolate salted caramel and yuzu combination desserts, which will leave you speechless. Ash & Elm is a must try for all
5
I have my lunch with friends or family at least once a month here. Love the variety of clean and fresh food here. Staff service is impeccable. Ambience is excellent to dine with friends or clients in Ash and Elm. The head Chef Eric is such friendly and excellent culinary chef.
4
Great steak and service! Crabcakes were really good. The striploin and the beef sauce that they provided was amazing!
4
Loved the ambience and service over in Ash & Elm; they even offered us a free chocolate cake knowing that it's a birthday celebration. :) We ordered Ash & Elm's platter, lobster bisque, seafood linguine and sea bass. So full towards the end of dinner as each table were given free bread platter to begin with!
5
Had a memorable birthday celebration at Ash And Elm on 9 Sep with my family. Great ambience and excellent food. We especially enjoyed the Tomahawk, seared Foie Gras, seafood linguini. Although the iberico pork chop is listed as chef's recommendations, it was tough. It didn't work for us as we had tasted more tender chops. We also ordered the mash, simple and smooth mash. We ended our meal with the baked to perfection Grand Marnier Soufflé - a perfect and delightful dessert and the complimentary chocolate birthday cake.One feedback I would like to provide is that we ordered the tomahawk first whilst looking at the menu because there is an indication of 30mins. However, the tomahawk arrived in around 10-15 mins. We weren't sure if it was for us and we checked with our server who then told us that it also depends on the doneness. So the tomahawk arrived on the table even before we were served the bread basket and in the next few minutes all the other dishes were served. The entire table was filled up and I had to tell the server to remove the small plates for the bread. The bread basket served with plain butter and seafood was the bomb and a pity we didn't get to enjoy it slowly.Nonetheless, it was a great meal. And don't forget to like and follow Ash and Elm on Facebook and they will reward you with a glass of complimentary cocktail
4
This place is pricey but is real value for money with the Amex 50% voucher. Great place for celebrations.
5
Ordered wine and cheese platter, flat bread for sharing, and various mains: risotto, pork loin, lasagna, pasta. Delicious food, good service, overall great dining experience.
4
We stayed at intercontinental and had dinner here. Staff were lovely and attentive and my kids enjoyed the place.
Would.come again
4
We had dinner here while staying at the hotel. We'd made a reservation but need not have bothered on a Monday night. We were given menus on being seated and asked if we wanted drinks; we only needed water. We ordered a sea bass fillet en papillotte and a salmon. The meals arrived within 15 minutes which was fine because we'd asked that the sea bass be well cooked. My wife felt the sea bass was excellent and I thought the salmon was very nice. The salmon was probably a little expensive for what it was otherwise the meal was very nice.

@TheKuoKnowsAnother fantastic place in Singapore for meat lovers. Ash & Elm might be a bit on the expensive side. But the quality more than makes up for the premium.The freshly-made flat bread is something to die for. Ash & Elm might not be a pizza specialist. But it puts its wood-fired oven to good use. It's not a bad way to start a meal.The charbroiled meat medley is quite superb. Three cuts of meat to provide three quite different experiences. There is enough for four, if not five people.Make sure you order the chocolate soufflé at the start of the meal. The chef needs advance notice. So don't leave it until the end of the meal.Ash & Elm is high on my list of go-to places for a meat-fest. The food is great. The ambience is salubrious. And the service is top drawer
4
Had dinner twice during our week stay at Intercontinental Singapore.Craving some steak we both had the ribeye fillet with mash & asparagus. Fast service which was great. Couldn't fault the meal except asparagus was slightly over steamed for my liking. Meat served with natural jus and hubby had the peppercorn jus good flavour from both.On the second visit I had the tenderloin and hubby had the New York strip loin loved the mash so had it again. Also ordered the grand marnier soufflé served with strawberries, vanilla custard and lemon sorbet.Both steaks were excellent medium rare mash delicious. Dessert was a fabulous way to end a good meal
5
Lovely place, my favourite restuarant now! We went for the sunday brunch. Variety was not very extensive but the quality was mamamia! I dare to say 90% of what i had that day was delicious! Will definitely be patronising ash & elm more often now! :
5
Dinner - foie gras, braised beef cheeks, seared scallops, grilled asparagus & baked Alaska. It was an enjoyable meal - the food was all good & service was impeccable. abit too dim though. Value for money, will go again.
5
Big bravo.Excellent service, knowledgeable and very nice staff. Great ambiance and excellent food. Will definitely come back
5
Second visit in two months, and food was just as fantastic! Came with the entire fam and got to try a whole lot of dishes, with every item cooked to perfection. Can't wait till my next time back
5
Had my buffet there, the spread was good, food was fresh and service was good. Good places for friend gathering.
3
Great service, very attentive and friendly. Complimentary bread basket was very good. Butter was delicious. Charcuterie platter had only 2 flavourful meats. Pastas was good. Steak was not executed well - char marks from grill, poorly seasoned. Dessert was good.
4
One of the best steaks around. Juicy, tasty and leaves you craving more. The tomahawk was fantastic and I highly recommend it.
4
Had dinner at Ash & Elm for my dad's birthday. The service level exceeded expectations, with the staff paying good attention to details and offering to go beyond what i had requested for. The mains of salmon and steak sharing platter was good, and so was the bread basket. However, the starters is only average. In terms of the environment, wish it was brighter.
3
Heard great reviews about this place so decided to try it, emailed them and inform to book table for 2 PAx, birthday celebration dinner for bf. Arrived on 05 Aug - 6pm but showed to a table of 6, eh?!?! Anyway table rectified. For starters we had the octopus (average) and lobster bisque (too salty). However the foie Gras was good. Pork Chop and Ribeye smoke grill was good but a tad too salty for us too. Enjoyed the bottle of Penfolds though. There was however no surprise cake for the boy, was a tad disappointed...
4
Our second visit here, a year later. Family dinner on a sunday night. When we sat down we were told 2 items in the menu were unavailable. By the time we placed our order, this changed to 5 items on the menu sold out. This was really disappointing since several of us ended up looking for Plan C for mains. Not the best way to start a meal. For a second year running, the kitchen runs out of the Tomahawk steak a couple of minutes before we place our order. Maybe you should reserve this ahead of time if you plan to have it rather than end up Tomahawk steakless like us :(Overall, food tasted good. Feedback on the lamb was good and the wagyu beef burger too although at $42 this is on the steep end for a burger.Apart from these 2 dishes, we enjoyed the desserts here too. Baked alaska and the grand marnier souffle were yummy. The complimentary bread platter was yummy to nibble on while waiting for our dishes to arrive.Also, we made our reservations prior and when calling us to confirm our reservation, the restaurant also checked if we were celebrating any special occasion. We were greeted with a delicious chocolate mousse birthday cake over desserts. That was a wonderful nice touch by the team. Thank you! Service was good too so we appreciated that despite all the hassle with placing orders
4
Tried this restaurant for dinner with wife. The bread serving was delicious (served with seaweed and normal butter) with good variety, a good start to the dinner. We decided to skip the appetizers and headed straight to mains - ordered the steak sampler platter (new york strip, tenderloin and the fantastic ribeye). Also added several veg sides - sauteed mushrooms and the grilled asparagus (which is easily one of the best tasting asparagus I ever had). Service was also very attentive. Worth a repeat visit definitely
5
Caviar buffet - Need I say more? I mean come on, how can they make money from it ?! But who's complaining here. The free flow champagne/wine/beer/sodas are really an affordable additional option on top of the wonderful spread they offer. It has a separate ala carte buffet which includes foie gras, risotto, seafood etc. Really looking forward to my next visit
4
I wasnt sure if this is a great place as I only remembered The Olive Tree at this location many years back. It turned out to be pretty cool. The ambience is great and the food items are fabulous. I particularly enjoyed the bread basket and the butter which came with it
5
We were there to entertain our friends from east Malaysia, and were firstly impressed by the service provided by the service staff; they were attentive to our needs throughout the 3-hour dining experience.Secondly, the food was absolutely wonderful. We had the tomahawk steak meant for 2, it was grilled to perfection and the meat was flavourful. Our Malaysian friends chose the grilled steaks which came well done just as they wanted. Another chose the grilled salmon, she cleaned up then plate! We also had a few kids with us and they had quite a great experience with their burger and spaghetti.Thirdly, the French Cabernet that we wanted from the wine list was out of stock. Being a fine western dining restaurant , shouldn't their cellar be sufficiently stocked? Mind you it was a Saturday evening. Anyway, they offered the Shiraz which was a saving grace. The Shiraz turned out to be a wonderfully spicy and complemented our meal very well.Our overall dining experience was a great one at Ash and Elm. We can't wait to try their lunch menus.
5
Will not disappoint the typical traveller. Top quality food and ingredients, coupled with excellent fresh juice.
5
Food was so darn good, service was impeccable and ambience was great! Would definitely return soon for more!
5
Celebrated my birthday with dinner at Ash & Elm, and man was I pleasantly surprised! Food is out of this world, and I already can't wait to come back again. Appetisers of mushroom veloute and crab cakes were on point, and mains of pork chops and scallops were beautifully cooked. Dessert was a bit of a miss for me, had the hazelnut/chocolate (?) pizza and that was the only dish that I didn't love.
5
My wife and I had dinner at Ash & Elm to enjoy the fine dining experience at the Intercontinental Hotel, Singapore.We are very impressed with the restaurant decorations, food (fresh oysters, muchroom soup, lobster soup, beef steak, grill chicken and soufflÃ© dessert) and drinks (red wine) and services. We like to share our experience with both local and travellers especially Bugis shoppers to dine at Ash & Elm
3
The food was tasty and well done (Risotto Milanese and Tasmanian Salmon) but the service left much to be desired. On sitting down, we noticed that our table did not have table napkins. The team member who showed us to our table did not realise that and so we had to ask for them eventually. Meanwhile, our food orders had been taken and water served. None of the team members who attended to us noticed our table was sans napkins.We also asked for the WiFi password which took longer than expected. This was surprising since the password was already neatly typed out and inserted into a plastic table card stand holder and all they had to do was hand us the stand holder.Having said that, the topping up of warm water was constant and the team members accorded us privacy accordingly.
4
This place has a great breakfast buffet spread. Ironically, they have such a large choice of gourmet cheese but my kids still missed their "Laughing Cow" cheese :). The egg options are comprehensive but no proper queue system so some guests are overlooked. Juice offered are individually bottled which is nice. And the coffee is heavenly. Only missing thing is an ice-cream station
5
The service was terrific, the food delicious, and the contemporary dining room, quite comfortable. The restaurant has a high ceiling and the lighting is spot on......not too bright, not too dark. The cuisine is European and their sauces were yummy. One of the fun aspects, they operate from three kitchens that are open for viewing. So glad we gave Ash & Elm a try. Definitely recommended
5
Was here for dinner last Nite celebrating Birthday. Service was excellent. Ambience good, quiet and able to have nice conversation with friend without disturbance. Bread plate was awesome, especially the seaweed butter that comes with it. Salty and aromatic, good with the baguette. My house wine from France was smooth and not too dry, goes well with the beef.Pumkin soup should be thicker, was a little diluted was still fine.Restaurant gave us a very delicious cake for the nite. Good gesture. Friend and I love the smooth chocolate that melts in the mouth. Definitely will come again
4
Great service, Great Food. Similar to "CUT" in a more frenchie way. Wish they had more souflle varieties e.g. passionate fruit, citrus, grand mariner. & desserts with a more fruity taste. After much MEAT, it will help balance the fatty healthy residue creating that wonder inside us :)
3
The breakfast is SGD 47 about USD 35. For this you get a large choice of a buffet breakfast. All the hot items are coldVery average at a high pric
5
Nice ambience, food good. I love the flat bread (pizza), price per person easily $60 to $70.
For people who like quiet ambience with great food, can consider trying it out.
5
Free flowing drinks are awesome!!!
Order something from their grill selection and drinks are free flow at a slight addition..
5
The ambiance was fantastic. The food was really good. The price was affordable and since we were celebrating a birthday we received a complimentary cake.
3
The restaurant has nice ambient And Service wise, top class. However cannot say the same for the food. I would rate the food taste average. Presentation was good.
4
Ash & Elm is a good place to have casual lunch around Bugis area.
The selection of appetisers and desserts will appeal to many.
The ambience is nice and service is very attentive.
3
The starters were fairly good, but our main dish the Iberico pork chops were a little over-cooked and not too tasty. The apple tatin dessert was AWFUL! The bottom of the pastry was so salty and bitter that we had to send it back, and they replaced it with another one, which was exactly the same. And this is one of Ash + Elm's best sellers! What happened to this batch of apple tatin??? Only saving grace was that they comped the dessert
4
Decided to try this out to celebrate my mom's birthday as we had 50% voucher. The staff was very attentive, patient and helpful as we took a very long time deciding what to eat. We decided to go with their tomahawk & pumpkin bacon flatbread recommendation & a few of our own choices.The food was very good! The food was quite a treat & a good change of style/flavor from the many hotel restaurants we have been to previously. The soup was interesting because they would pour it out unto the bowl of cream right in front of you. We had the mushroom soup & the lobster bisque. I've had much better mushroom soup before, so it didn't stand a high chance with me, and I found the lobster bisque too salty for my liking. However, we were indeed intrigued with the way they serve their soup, and phones were out to capture it on video. The flatbread was definitely a mouth-watering and yummy new experience! Indeed sweet & salty blended well and it was indeed a good recommendation. My family enjoyed it much. Definitely something new but delightful. The tomahawk (beef) was simply GORGEOUS! It had a lovely grill smell & taste to it that makes one want to have more. (and this is coming from a person who doesn't really appreciate steaks & prepare chicken or fish to beef). With 3 dips given, it can serve 2-3 pax and the chef kindly offered to slice it for us for our easy sharing. I also highly suggest following the chef's recommendation for done-ness of the meat to experience the dish based on how the chef envisioned it. :)The Wagyu Beef Burger was Excellent! The beef "patty" was unlike the usually beef patty you would get that is made from minced meat. This patty had more texture & was lovely with the caramelised onions & cheese. Even the burger bread by itself was nice. The fries were solid too.If you love fat-melting meat, go for the pork chop. Ain't the healthiest but it was lovely having the fats melt in your mouth as you chew on the meat.Oh, I missed out the complimentary bread plate that they gave as appetiser as well as our lovely chicken Cesar Salad. The bread plate came with 4 types of interesting yummy bread (I have no idea what they were, but my family devoured them) and served with salted and unsalted butter. The Cesar Salad was good too and we savoured every bit of it. Dessert! We tried their chocolate hazelnut pizza which was very interesting! Not like your pizza kind of crust, nor is it a pie or a tart. Loved the ice cream & the like chocolate crushed ice that was served with it. Moreover, because the attentive staff caught my hint that it was my mother's birthday, they wrote happy birthday on the serving plate & added a candle to it. Perfect for a birthday picture!The apple tartin was interesting & nice too though I don't remember much of it because my heart had been sold to the lovely tomahawk meat (the irony being I'm not a beef-person but a dessert person; just that night my tongue betrayed me).We really enjoyed the ambience & music and the comfortable seats as we enjoyed our dinner and talked with one another. The tables were not too close to each other so we felt like we had some privacy & thus freedom to enjoy ourselves without catching other people's attention. Moreover at the end, the kind staff also introduced us to their 3 part kitchen - the open concept, the oven, and the cold room where the cold cut/procured meat are at and shared with us the concept of their restaurant, seeing our interest. I didn't notice the open kitchen initially (becoz i sat back-facing it), but thought it was pretty cool to be able to see the master chefs at work preparing our sumptuous meal if we want to. Definitely a place I'll recommend if you are not on a tight budget and are willing to give yourself (or someone) a good treat

I had dinner at Ash & Elm today with my family. The service was really good & friendly. For the food I actually liked the vegetables better than the meat and fish. The ambiance is nice too. Enjoyed the visit
3
A group of us went here to celebrate a birthday. We did not do the buffet. Most of the party ordered the steak. I ordered the pork which was a much smaller portion compared to the steak. I was actually really thankful for that as I was already stuffed from the appetizers/share plates. Here are some notes:Crab cake (was recommended to us)—meh at best. BURRATINA CHEESE salad—weak. Lack of taste. (Mind you I enjoy eating steamed plain broccoli) PROSCIUTTO AND ARUGULA flatbread—to be honest, I almost forgot we had this. Very average. ASH & ELM PLATTER—okSLOW-GRILLED SPANISH IBERICO PORK CHOP—I enjoyed it! Compared with the steaks that my friends ordered, I def think I made the right choice. Wasn't the most amazing Iberico Pork I had, but it was good compared with the quality of everything else I have eaten on that table. Mashed potato—Had one spoon of it. was ok but OH you know who makes the most amazing mashed potato? Salted and Hung! They add squid ink in it so it's black, the texture is really strange too but wow once I had a taste of it I could not stop. SEASONAL SOUFFLE—I was too full at this point to enjoy anything as we have brought our own cake, but I did enjoy it more than the starters

You know, sometimes it is a pure pleasure when 5 star place is a 5 start experience. Everything was simply superb for the couple of hours we were there. We took the Champagne Brunch for 2 at the total bill including service and tax was $277. But the champagne was continually topped up throughout and then the lovely Sommelier (Luis) offered us some super red wine to enjoy with the cheese.They even had DIY Bloody Marys with Absolute Elyis vodka - wow.The food was appropriately chilled for seafood and well cooked for the meats. We will definitely come back!

Had a great time catching with long standing friends over Champagne brunch.
Top service and great food with ad hoc special birthday requests impeccably delivered.
Merci chef Philippe pour la soupe à l'ognon!
5
The free breakfast here for guests in intercontinental hotel had a vast variety of food.Asian,western and indian cuisine and even a waffle station.Amazing!!
4
Had a really good meal, the tomahawk in particular was perfectly cooked. With good sides and starters too. Staff were very obliging the only problem was the lighting was so dim that we couldn't read the menus.
3
Fairly nice place. Had the lunch buffet. Pleasant although the food is very western, so might not suit everyone's tastes.
5
good food and great service..
plating was done very beautifully too..
price is on the high side but was worth it..
4
I liked this restaurant in the early days when it used to be Olive Tree. Years later now, as Ash & Elm, the restaurant has retained the great service and tasty quality food. I had the semi-buffet lunch at $28++ which was excellent value for the quality of the spread.
5
Tonight we celebrated cousin's birthday at Ash & Elm, very nice ambiance.It was our 1st visit to this restaurant, the service was excellent, superb attentive staff and we love their food! We had steak, tuna, pork chop, grill chicken, soup and salad.. and all of them is 10/10! The restaurant provided a little surprise by giving a complimentary cake to my cousin.The chocolate cake is really yummy.Will definitely return to this restaurant again
2
Tried to order a flat bread pizza to go. The guy looked at me like I was crazy. I thought there may have been a language problem, so I tried different ways to say I wanted a pizza to take back to our room. He was astounded. Said I can't do that. I had to order it by roomservice. A circular conversation continued for a bit until I caved and said OK I'll do Room service. Then he laid on me that he doesn't accept Room service orders, they have to be called in. So I lowered my head in defeat and trudged back to our room to place the order.UNBELIEVABLE! But I have to admit, the pizza was pretty good
4
Had dinner at this place on Saturday night. Good selection on the menu. Prices ok. Good service, worth a go, dress is casual good selection at the bar. They do have specials set menu. Only one draw back from my personal point is they do allow children in prams 
3
Was really surprised the restaurant was really empty during our visit, probably because we had an early seating 6.30pmWait staff seem lacklustre, not very sharp. Was not responsive to empty glasses and not prompt to serve appetisers/ bread rolls. A little disappointed that the starter-platter was a sharing plate. Undeniably tasty. Jumbo scallops main was a complete let down. Scallops were not jumbo in size and only two pieces were served! Didn't believe my eyes when compared to my partner's striploin. The beef was of a decent portion size - juicy and flavourful. To think we had to pay an extra of $20-23 for each of this meal set. Dessert briefly salvaged the disgruntlement- good contrast of tastes - the nutty coconut cutting through the sharp acidity of the passion fruit. Brilliant work
5
pork chop was amazingly tender. beef steak was great. excellent service with good ambience.would definitely recommend this place for business or friends gathering
5
This in-house restaurant has a great breakfast and lunch buffet that has everything! Dinner is also very nice.
5
A great night out. Food, service and atmosphere excellent. Will be back. James our waiter one of the best we have ever had.
5
A really nice restaurant adjacent to the Lobby Lounge of the Intercontinental Hotel Singapore.Great Service and a very wide selection during morning breakfast buffet. It does get busy so be early. Guess its popular with hotel guests.Really enjoyed dinner in the restaurant., I stayed a week and had dinner every night but one. I did not run out of things to order. The wine selection is equally as good.My favourite part of the restaurant experience was house cured meats and Cheese Room. There is a huge selection of cheeses and so much fresh seafood, which I was told is sustainable sourced, which also gets a big tick from me
3
Had the rib eye . 120 days full grain. Looked delicious but wasn't that juicy or tender. Asked for medium rare but was not cooked to perfection. I would rate it average and not the best value for money however Singapore is costly for food. Service was good and the presentation excellent. Few more tweaks required to bring to perfection. Will visit again to see improvements.
5
Lovely ambience, great service, fantastic food! We shared a 900g Tomahawk steak & ceaser salad between 4 pax and it was more than enough. The steak was one of the best, if not the best, I've ever had. Succulent and melts in your mouth. The ambience sets for a romantic atmosphere. The chef came out and chatted with us and other customers. We made prior reservations. We were there on a Saturday night and almost all tables were taken
5
Had a wonderful brunch with free flow of champagne, customize bloody Mary, and selection of teas and coffee were on the house. Food was delicious, especially loved the duck confit and beef cheeks. Fresh selection of fresh seafood too. Service was excellent, Farhan was super attentive and our flutes were never empty. Had a lovely cake too as it was a birthday celebration. Will definitely come again.
5
1st time having dinner on 1st Apr at this relatively new restaurant with nice ambience... was surprised that the food was great and the service was excellent. Mr Selvanathan made the evening special for us by making sure the arrangement was adequate for my group of friends with children. His attentiveness and initiative made us feel like VIPs. It's been a while since I have received such great service and went back again on 8 Apr 17 the following week for the semi- buffet lunch. Food was great and service was again immaculate!! Really appreciate the great service Mr Selva and my friends were all very satisfied.Kennet

Inside the Intercontinental hotel this restaurants serves breakfast and lunchAll the western food items at breakfast are cold such as bacon, sausage, hash brown and tomatoes Went for lunch at 1445 and was told they had just closed. Even the sign I was stood by said 1500 and the in room literature says the same. I asked reception who said it was open until 1500 and they accompanied me to the restaurant. Who I believe was the restaurant manager then said it closed at 1445 to new guests. Fine change all your signs and literature pleas
2
We were there for birthday dinner. All went well (food was good and well presented) until about 8pm when we start feeling that the staff are in hurry to clear the table. Being a fine dinning restaurant, we expect this could have been done more professionally. But one of their staff (probably a manger, since he is wear a blazer) trying to clear the cutlery all at one go single-handedly. Unfortunately, one of the knife dropped on me, and I asked if he was in a hurry (giving him the benefit of doubt that it was going to be Earth hour by 8:30pm where they will off the lights.) Instead the reply I got was "...Sorry, I'm not in hurry, but the cutlery is heavy. Do you want to try?". And the next moment I see was he holding a bunch of cutlery in front of me!!We decided to skip dessert and asked for the bill, which took them quite a while to bring it to us. We left feeling disappointed with the whole experience
2
From being seated by the pursed lipped maitre de to be being left for 5-10 minutes without even any water on a slow night with plenty of staff, well overpriced food, was nice enough, but so is anywhere
3
Overall not bad if you can get a deal. Not too crowded. But if no deal, might be a bit expensive for what you are getting.
3
For a hotel restaurant Ash & Elm offer a good range of food with mainly Mediterranean options. The mushroom veloute was packed with flavor, the chicken supreme was nice but nothing special. I saw lots of people enjoying the steaks which the restaurant specialize in and these looked very good.I like dark restaurants but if the lighting is low the menu needs to be printed in a way that can be read. Bigger print or better contrast to the background would be helpful
4
We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat here one evening. The steaks were lovely and we all enjoyed our meal very much. Staff were very friendly and the restaurant itself was lovely. You can watch the chefs preparing and cooking the food which I enjoy.
4
Great food and lovely ambiance!! The bread basket and the beef as well as the sides were excellent!! It was rather nice of the restaurant to give us a whole cake instead of a sliced cake for our birthday celebration. However, the chocolate hazelnut pizza was rather disappointing though.
4
Was slightly miffed when I found out I was seated in a dark, corner area which made reading the menu and seeing the food a bit difficult. But the restaurant was running fairly full and the friendly service made up for it. The senior staff were more proactive while the junior staff were super friendly and really tried their very best to deliver good service.The food was good, solid and honest. Simple flavours but well executed. Portions were on the small side vis-a-vis the prices - the main dish of Hokkaido Scallops came with 3 scallops. Crab cakes were chock-full of crab meat (pure crab meat and no fillers), but also, moderately sized.Ambience was upbeat, contemporary and comfortable.Overall a very good dining experience
5
We dined here a couple of nights while we stayed here. We enjoyed the ambience, good selection and value for $ menu. Their customer service was great too
4
I went there twice with my 11 year old daugther for lunch on Saturday. We chose Ã  la carte menu dishes and we have never been disappointed. It is a very nice place, the service is good and the food is fresh, very well presented and the bread basket is one of the best we ever had in Singapore. The ice-cream scoop is very big (one scoop = 2 large "regular" scoops !) and very tasty
5
We just had a semi buffet lunch with my family and friends. Food is delicious , service is great , especially kids menu food is well prepared by Chef . My parents really enjoyed appetiser , soup and dessert from buffet counter. The environment is excellent and most important that the price is reasonable especially in 5 star hotel . Each of us spent about 38++ per person w one main course. Will definitely be back again in future.
1
Menu offers "scallops with cauliflower, broccoli and sauce" at $36. On the big plate - only 3 mid-size scallops (not very fresh either but edible) and pea-sized bits of broken-up cauliflower and broccoli! CONTRAST: When a friend ordered one of the steaks, the waiter asked what "additional sides" would my friend want - On the facing page to the Steaks offer, there was a range of side dishes (eg, potatoes, salad, etc) each costs $8-$12 on top of the steak price (depending on cut of course). In the end, my friend changed to Wagyu Beefburger (on the same Menu page as the Scallops). The Beefburger came with French Fries and a side bowl of Salad. Clearly, the Side Dishes were applicable only for Steak Orders. In any case, the waiter did not ask for Side Dishes for our Scallop Orders. It may be "Nouvelle Cuisine" to feed customers only pea-sized broken bits of cauliflower but it is likely more a "profit maximizing scheme" for Ash&Elm.The Lobster Bisque at $18 was more like a small cup-size serving. Outrageous rip-of
5
Great selection and quality of food. It was very clean and and organized well. Just make sure to pay for the breakfast a day ahead of time to save $10.
5
We stayed at the intercontinental and booked in for breakfast here. It was very good and all the food tasty and fresh. Well presented buffet that caters for all nationalities. We loved this place. 😍
4
We were there for a birthday celebration. The ambient was great with good service. The restaurant also served a complimentary birthday cake. It's a pity that we were not able to finish it as we were too full at the end of the meal.
3
The ambience was good. Nicely renovated and quiet. Food was decent, but nothing to shout out for. For appetisers, had the crab steak which was normal, and a lobster bisque which was good.For mains, ordered a medium rare steak. The center was medium rare but 30% of the steak was medium well (at the fringes). Also ordered the beef burger, but the seasoning of the patty wasn't to our liking.Service was prompt and friendly, overall a pleasant experience
3
First walk in, place looked great. Ambiance was just nice. Not too dark, not too cold, etc. Menu looked and sounded great too. Once we sat down, we were attended by a pretty inattentive waiter. Our water was not refilled, we did not get any bread until we asked(even though the table next to us got it right away). Food was pretty average. Risotto was pretty tasteless although cooked well. The brioche for the foie gras was cold. Not too sure if it was intentional or not. The fillet mignon was alright. Good. My girlfriend's lobster was a little pathetic. Maybe the size of 2 fish balls? Don't bother serving lobster if it's that type of portion in my opinion. Especially for a 3 course menu? Yeah. That would only fly for a 300 dollar tasting menu. Dessert was heavy and just didn't work for us. The citrus flavors were all over the place, and the chocolate mousse/ganache was just too much! It just didn't work for us and we didn't finish our desserts. Although I felt that was the intention to balance the small portions. Might have expected a little too much from this place, but felt that they missed out on a lot of the little essentials.
4
Service was excellent,except that they did not allow us to takeaway the cake which we were too full. I felt it was a waste to throw away the cake. The restaurant requires to be more flexible in this sense
4
Thought I'd check out this European-fare restaurant in Intercontinental Hotel Singapore after a couple of recommendations.The meet-and-greet and follow-up service by the restaurant manager was a pleasant surprise. She recommended my party try the 900 grams Tomahawk steak which can feed 3 people at $160. It was a 300-day grain-fed Australian wagyu beef with a marbling score of 4. For friends who are unfamiliar, a Tomahawk steak is actually a rib steak that is cut from the fore-rib with the bone left on. The long bone is then french-trimmed. The end result is a steak with a long bone that resembles a North American hatchet with a straight shaft.The steak appeared as described and I had to resist the temptation to grab the "shaft" and bite into the meat. It was cooked to medium-rare perfection with charred bits at the edges and fat. Each bite had the right amount of juiciness from rendered fat in the meat and soft fragrant flesh. We were informed that New Zealand Manuka woodchips were used in the grilling process to add robust flavors and natural caramelisation. It was certainly worth the 30 minutes wait and money spent
5
My parents decided to celebrate their 30th Anniversary here and they were not disappointed one bit. They had the 7 course set menu and were very impressed by the knowledge of all the waiters who did not hesitate to snap a photo for us with enthusiasm. The staff is the key that makes this place shine. Our waiter, Gabriel may have been new to working there, but he was very knowledgeable of all the food presented to us and was very personable whenever he came by to check in on us. Besides Ash and Elm, he was also very knowledgable of the other restaurants in the hotel. Gabriel really provides great qualities that all Intercontinental should inhabit. I'd definitely hope to be back again
5
The predecessor of Ash & Elm was The Olive Tree, which many would regard as one of the better hotel in-premise restaurants in Singapore. I have dined at both these restaurants and was glad that the hotel had found an even better successor for its primary in-premise restaurant
5
Showcasing a wide array of choices from pastries to cold cuts to Japanese rice and condiments, Indian curries and condiments, and buffet line staples such as bacon rashers, sausages, browned potatoes, cereals, cheese, fruit juices, gourmet yoghurt and preserves - one is spoilt for choice. I preferred the hot dishes prepped to order from the live stations which include eggs done the way you like it and local noodles such as Laksa or Chicken Noodle Soup. I didn't expect much by way of coffee but the Latte I had was well-balanced with chocolatey and nutty notes. Definitely a place worth returning to.
4
One of their waiter simply impressed ME to say for our lst time visit!
While waiting to bill out at Cashier area..He offered Us a Mini Birthday cake on house for my Partner's Birthday 😁Sweet & Well-Hosted.)) THANKS FOR EVERYTHING👍🏽
3
Had the scallops as main course and my wife had the seafood linguine.... nothing to shout about. Service was great but we were seated among Un-cleaned tables which for a restaurant of this stature, is unacceptable. Bread and my lobster soup was great though...
5
Service was excellent and quality of beef is very good. Ambience is also fantastic. Prices of drinks is a little pricey though!
3
Food and service was slightly above average but definitely worth a visit with a date for the excellent ambience!
4
The steaks are great quality meat, the one trouble being they do not understand BLUE. My blue was medium, it went back and I did get one that this time was rare. I kept it and it was delicious. The service is very good and prompt. A busy restaurant as it should be with the high quality food served there
3
Soooo many people having breakfast here. Food kept running out - they didn't seem to be able to restock to keep up with demand. Food was usual hotel breakfast fare and usual hotel breakfast quality. Was expecting more as the decor looked so nice and inviting. It is probably a nice venue when the masses haven't descended on the property - seemed popular with locals for breakfast as well as inhouse guests
4
Stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights and ate breakfast here all 3 days. The range of food is vast with a wide choice of different cuisines and food styles. A filling way to start the day. The service is very good. They check the food often and make sure it is all good.
5
Not all hotel restaurants can manage breakfast, lunch, and dinner and make it interesting. A lazy choice I know to eat in-house however sometimes it's all you feel like .. other than room service . The interior was interesting and a bit eclectic. But in a good way. The service was Excellent. The staff were hip and engaging .. in a good way ... and knew their craft. Wine list was well put together. The menu has lots to choose from however we couldn't go past the grill. And just perfectly cooked as ordered. I'm looking forward to going back.
5
Went to the restaurant on Fri and Sat night when I have my staycation in Hotel Intercontinental. Went twice because I wanted to try all their three culinary theatres. On Fri, I have the charcuterie and cheese buffet with wines. The chef at the charcuterie station was very nice to offer me alternatives as I do not take beef. I ordered the home made flatbread to share with my friend. Nothing beats eating piping hot bread with good selection of cheese and wines from different countries. The next day, I focus on the mains. Ordered a pork chop and a lamb rack. I think its the best charcoal grill pork and lamb I ever had in Singapore as the other equally good ones were found overseas. I will definitely be back to try their chicken supreme, tuna steak and probably chocolate hazelnut pizza.
4
if you're staying at the InterCon, this is your Breakfast place for non-Club guest. When we were told Ash & Elm, we mistaken it for H&M, ok bad joke.The food variety is huge, lots of freshly cooked food, choice of Asian or Western, plus an Egg Station.We did come here for dinner too, the place is transformed and does not resemble the Breakfast place anymore, one get decent table service, must try the New York Sirlion Strips at promo price.
3
Not a bad place. Nice pieces of cured meats and interesting salads. Desserts and ice creams not bad too. But the main courses were not exciting. Somehow they were not memorable.
5
Absolutely marvellous restaurant that one should definitely not miss. Thoroughly enjoyed dinner at Ash & Elm
4
Had the semi buffet lunch with my family members. We ordered the beef steak which was really good and coupled with the semi buffet provided, it is a nice place to go for a delicious meal while enjoying excellent service at the same time.
5
Great food, lovely ambience, wonderful service. Wait staff remembered our dietary preferences and made amendments without our request.. Not too crowded on a weekday evening. A little pricey, but worth it for an celebration.
5
Ash & Elm present an amazing breakfast spread! Even if you're not staying at the hotel, it's a nice place for some wonderful food!
5
One of the best brunch set ups available.Seafood at it' best served with a Bloody Mary cart that comes and goes until you lose count of how many you already had and start asking everyone if they want some tomato juice to go with the tabasco.This is a space where you want to be with a nice group of friends from 12pm to 4pm eating, laughing and enjoying the atmosphere.And if you think this is expensive, you're wrong.They should charge more for such high level service and 1st class F&B.Can't wait to go back
5
Nice Restaurant! This is a master chef signature restaurant. Got to see Marco Pierre, the celeb chef/judge here. Enjoyed my Charcuterie here
5
We recently had Sunday brunch here with friends and family and it was excellent. The buffet is not enormous but there is plenty of everything and it is all very good. Great value for money as well and we will definitely be going back
4
Yummy food cooked fresh with many options for cuisine. The service is friendly and mostly quick. But if the restaurant is very busy you may have to remind the staff for your tea or hot water. The great thing is from today they are getting the Masterchefs to prepare the menu with Marco Pierre White. So if you are a foodie head there.
5
I stayed 2 nights alone in Singapore and dinner alone is not my strongest point. I had a seat on the buffet in this restaurant with view on the kitchen. I ordered a New York sirloin steak. The steak was very good and the scenery of the team working in the kitchen did time fly by. Was very good
5
My wife and I had dinner here, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, the food arrived fairly quickly and was first class.
If ever you are in Singapore give it a go you will not be disappointed.
3
For such an expensive lunch buffet costing $58++ per pax i thinknit would be reasonable to expect free flow coffee and tea, which were unfortunately not the case. No beverage was included in the cost.
5
Great job to the team- from the servers to the cook! Wonderful experience indeed. Had their striploin and Caesar with shrimps coupled with free flow wines. Everything was perfect. Steak was one of best in town area - cooked to desired doneness without flaw. Service was prompt and very friendly. Worked as a team to serve all diners. Well done all!
4
This restaurant is located within the Intercontinental Hotel. It is a nice place and has a great menu. I thought it was a little pricey but it may not be for Singapore. Everything we had was good. My wife had steak tenderloin and roasted potatoes. It is a la carte, so steak was around 50 Singapore dollars, side of potatoes was $12SD. Steak was cooked perfect and very tender. I had grilled scallops. You get 3 large scallops. They were large and cooked perfectly and very tasty. About $36SD plus $12SD for au gratin potatoes, which were also good. We had a grilled vegetable salad to start which was nice. I would encourage you to review the menu online
5
Birthday dinner with the husband...have to plan something amazing, right? Thanks to Citibank for having $100Gourmet dinners. Yay!So the menu for the $100Gourmet dinner looked really good and the husband's birthday was coming up. So I booked us a table, not really sure what to expect.It was fantastic. The place was lovely with indirect lighting, and tables were far apart enough so I did not have to hear other diners' conversations.The husband chose the wine pairing and was satisfied with 3 of the 4 wines. The food was amazing and just the right portion size considering it was a 6-course dinner. They did real justice to the steak...just beautiful. Please see the photos for the full menu
4
I was lucky to be in Singapore the same time as a Friend who lives there was celebrating her birthday. 6 adults and 7 children ranging from 3 to 12. Such an amazing range of food from oysters, sushi, roast beef, lobster and a huge range of deserts. Seriously good food and then cupcake making for the kids at 1pm and a kids play room. So good.
5
I visited for lunch as a guest in the hotel and the close proximity. I was impressed. I have to admit, IC Singapore has a great restaurant selection.I ordered from the menu and skipped the buffet, I am usually not impressed with buffet style, no reflection on this one, I didn't try it, just not my thing.Good food and at a reasonable price. I even visited again for dinner just to see what the dinner menu was like. Highly recommend their in-house ice cream
4
I choose Ash & Elm restaurant because it is located under Inter-continental hotel where I stayed in Singapore and it was nearest European style restaurant. It was right choose. First of all staff is very professional and welcoming. Nice "rich" atmosphere with silent calm music. Then dishes. I ordered mushroom soup for entree. Prior to soup I was provided by brad and butter "collection".- different texture bread and different tasted butters. Then soup was coming. Actually it was a plate with mushrooms , croutons and herbs, where waiter put soup liquid in front of me. Portion was very small but full of mushroom aromas and taste. Delicious. For main I had beef sirloin Presentation was incredible- peace of meat on the iron plate with some baked cherry tomatoes, peace fried corn, lemon and garlic. iron saucepan on the side. Meat was tender and juicy, exactly as I ordered medium rare. Sauce full of aromas.This dish is a compliment to chef. For desert I had salty chocolate dish. Great presentations and taste. Only one issue, this place is a little bit expensive as all Singapore. However it is really worth it
3
So I was pretty excited about going here, especially after seeing how good the reviews were! Upon arriving, I won't deny that the restaurant vibes were very nice, in particular the open kitchen, which added a nice touch to the rustic decor of the place. Service was also good, and honestly the bread basket was great too - with four different choices of bread all warm and fresh served with seaweed butter, I really can't ask for more. Even the flatbread (which to me was like pizza) was great - good balance of cheese and toppings on the dough. The one thing that really brought my experience down was the steak. We ordered the large beef sampler, which came with a portion of tenderloin, sirloin and striploin. I should've guessed it wouldn't be when the served asked whether we wanted it medium or well done... we said medium rare. It came out medium well. Obviously for us steak lovers, we thought that was a huge waste of what would potentially great steak. I'm not sure if this was just a one-off slip up, or it was their thing to serve their steaks towards the cooked side, but this was definitely not what I was looking for.
5
We had heard about the Sunday 'Bubbles & Brunch' through other Survival Chic Members but didn't want to get our expectations up, as we are big brunch fans and can be picky. As soon as we approached the buffet for a first inspection, the head Chef came over and volunteered to give us a personal tour. Instead of being huge and overwhelming like some other brunches in town, this one focused on truly high-quality products: lobster, seared foie gras, fresh oysters, angus beef, cheeses & charcuterie, and even a whole bar full of caviar bar! Totally classy and extremely delicious. There is also a selection of small plates you can order, which are perfectly sized not to be overwhelming. The mushroom cappucino was a favorite, as was the pork loin. The friendly waiters were constantly coming around (literally every 5 minutes) with the Perrier Jouet champagne served from gorgeous Magnum bottles... and even the F&B director came around introducing himself to guests. Overall wow-factor experience, and would be even more fun with a group of foodie friends
5
We stay in the Intercontinental during our stay in Singapore and took the opportunity to eat here. The food and service was excellent and for a high class hotel the cost was acceptable. Give it a try, it worth it.
5
Constant decent food that people missed out, what a shame.
Service wasn't the best to start but after a few visits, the team got better.
5
We were given good recommendations and the food was very nice. We love the pita bread especially. We will be back soon.
4
This is a soft spot for diners with pleasant atmosphere. We enjoyed our food and conversations. Service was good as soon as we finished our meals, the server could clear your table.
4
Food is good of an evening but expensive e.g $12 for a small serve of mashed potato and $12 for 6 sticks of asparagus
Don't think too much about wine $20 a glass
3
Had their semi buffet appetizer and dessert lunch. Pleasant ambience. The staff member, Gabriel, attending to our table was friendly and knowledgable. The charcuterie was good. Selection was not large. But comprehensive. Perhaps 6-8 meat items. Usual salad bar. Some interesting premade items. I can't remember the names. Not what I usually eat. But oddly quite nice. Leeks, artichokes come to mind. The minestrone was better than the cream corn soup. Strangely there were only 3 types of bread. I had 2 types. One good, BUT the other poor. As far as the desserts go, I have to confess that the Haagen-das ice-cream pleased me the most. The fresh fruits were also good, with yummy rock melon. As well as ripe golden kiwi fruit. BUT, the cakes and tarts fared rather poorly in comparison. Wrong recipes or ingredients. You can get MUCH better all over Singapore. My main gripes:On arriving at 12.25pm or so, there was simply NO ONE at the entrance. We waited for a minute or two before walking in and frantically trying to get the attention of a waiter. Not a good first impression. This is a big BUT. As others have noted, the restaurant can be COLD. It really is true. However it depends where you sit. The Air-conditioner outlets are at the sides. So, some seats against the walls will get a cold draft. The staff know this. Yet, they seated us at such a table when the restaurant never got more than half full. They offered to let us change tables when we brought it up. BUT the clever thing would have been to seat us at a good table in the first place, since so many were available. And in my reservation I did ask for a nice table as we were celebrating an occasion. Which they also forgot. Still it's not a bad place. Just Walk right in, ask for a warm table, and eat selectively

My friend and I had a get together over dinner at Ash and Elm today. The ambience was cozy and pleasant but the central air conditioning was a little too cold for us, which can't be helped as we didn't want to affect all the other diners. The bread basket and butter was already very appetising so we looked forward to trying their dishes. The caesar salad was quite lightly but adequately dressed and I liked that they used fried pork belly in the dish. The crab cakes were a little disappointing in terms of small portions and lack of taste, as the flour was thick and there was no flavour of crab at all. The striploin steak I ordered was excellent! My medium rare beef was succulent but so well-rested that there was no blood oozing out, and it was served with saturine yet mildly acidic, plump roasted heirloom tomatoes and other farm vegetables that enhanced the enjoyment of my steak fabulously.

We do not usually eat at Hotel restaurants, but this one night we were very tired and just wanted something light to eat that was non asian and close by ( Don't get me wrong - WE LOVE Asian food and think it's one of the best cuisines ever ).We went to the Ash and Elm and was pleasantly surprised ! we had a chacuterie plate of several different types of Iberico hams and a flat bread with chorizo and cheese and it was all very delicious and enough to keep us going until breakfast. Down side was the glass of wine was almost as expensive as the chacuterie plate. Upside is if you are staying at the hotel you get 20% off the bill !Nice ambience, good service but air conditioning was freezing 
5
This is one of my best place in Singapore for my lunch. Great food, great service and nice atmosphere. I found the air-condition too cold and, as a result, the next day I ended up with a flu. I loved the Risotto, very well done as in Italy....not asian style.The coffee is great, always consistent and with a very good aftertaste
4
We paid an earlier visit to have an ala carte meal, and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service. The charcuterie was the highlight, and we decided to come again for Sunday brunch. It was a buffet style brunch, with a good selection of seafood, pastas, roasts, booze and cheese. Again, it was the charcuterie and cheese selection that was the highlight, followed by the seafood spread. Only the desserts needed improvement. It may not be the cheapest in town, but the ambience and the fact that it wasn't overcrowded allowed my family to truly enjoy Sunday brunch at a leisurely pace without having to jostle
4
The restaurant serves excellent steak that is succulent and accompanied with nicely charred tomatoes and capsicum.
3
Food isn't as great as its social media presence. The idea of a
Semi brunch is good, but food and offerings could be much better.
5
Value for money! the seafood is very fresh! Superb spread. A very satisfying meal. And if you are a pokemon fan, the area around Intercontinental Singapore is full of pokestop and neverending lure modules. Can go pokemon hunting after eating such a sinful meal. 😝

Good Breakfast. Good variety. Service quality has improved from last stay. Did not have to wait for seats
5
I enjoyed breakfast at the Ash and Elm. It was wonderful. Service beyond expectation and the variety of the food accommodates all tastes.
5
Atmosphere is nice, quite and charming.
Steaks were amazing.
Price is reasonable.
Service is excellent and welcoming staff.
4
The selection of food is good. Japanese, asian and western choices. Freshly squeezed juices. Coffees can be endless...
I love the teas...

I enjoyed dinner here one night during my stay. It was a Sunday night so it was extremely quiet. The staff were attentive without being too interruptive. I enjoyed for entree - crab cakes, they were very tasty and then the salmon as a main dish. The portion sizes were generous and they provided complementary bread. I also had some wine and glasses are about AU$20 each. Overall the meal was lovely, but not cheap
4
My friend and I went to try their Friday Wine (2 glasses) and Free-flow Cheese at package price of SGD38++. And it was worth it! Reasonable price for the cheese and ham selection. I forget the names of the cheese available but there were about 6-8 types of cheese and charcuterie that were good! The one must-try is their duck rillette
5
For me, there's no better breakfast than a South Indian breakfast--and this place does it right. Of course, it also does European, American, and Japanese breakfasts all served buffet style. The service is fast and attentive. A perfect way to start a day full of business meetings
5
Large variety of international cuisine! Food was excellent, I had so much that I skipped lunch. Their Cheese/Ham selection was one of the best I've tried.
4
A very relaxed place to have food, with a very nice light coming through the ceiling.
Staff very active and friendly.
Simply loved the ice cream served - irresistible!
5
Excellent service; was there for breakfast. given a overview of the key serving station for the buffet. In term of spread, is a good spread from western, Chinese to Indian.
4
The breakfast buffet offers Chinese & Western dishes
Newspaper & Coffee is a good company in a not too quiet dining area
5
European food with an Asian twist, freshly prepared. Very good service too. Recommend highly. As usual in Singapore, wines are expensive.

This was a second visit since the opening of Ash & Elm and I found Ash & Elm was a much better addition to the now defunct Olive Tree Restaurant. The newly rolled out Sunday Brunch was a must go on my list and not only did it not disappoint, it exceeded expectations in various ways.Food variety was huge, in my opinion, stretching from the front of the entrance to the interior of the restaurant. Dishes were plated beautifully and came in just nice portions that won't get you overwhelmed from eating. Truthfully, many made-to-order small plates were worth highlighting such as the lobster risotto, duck leg confit, pork loin and braised beef cheeks. Each dish was executed well with flavours on point. One issue however, was that the pans which the meats were placed in were too small. The pork loin for instance, came in a slab which was difficult to be sliced in the small pan and either had to be chewed off the fork whole or placed on a side plate. On a sidenote, the egg benedicts had yolks that were overcooked probably left too long on the hot pan. The caviar station came as a surprise, and again you could do your own mix and match. The desserts were alright, especially the banana strudel and coffee opera cake which was delicious. The ice cream could have been better since it tasted more substandard and too creamy to my liking, probably some refreshing citrusy sorbet would be nice. The cut fruits looked a bit sad, having left out in the open for long without ice.The DIY Bloody Mary section, on the other hand, was a good addition for brunch.Honestly I didn't have a good impression of the service level back when I dined at Olive Tree. But that Sunday changed my perception with the fantastic, attentive and friendly service rendered to not just me, but the other guests around me as well. Overall, it was a great experience and I hoped the ASHceptional standard continued the next time I was there

Me and my friends decided to take dinner attracted by nice interior expecting good service and good Italian gastronomic experience. We ordered mix of cold cuts as starter and seafood linguini as main. Food presentation was good as one would expect. Waiters were quite enthusiastic but not really knowledgeable. Cold cut cured meats included parma ham, mortadella, dry salami etc. All of those simply did not have distinguished taste indicating inappropriate handling. I guess all those items were stored in refrigerator for prolonged time and taken in and out on several occasions. I don't want to consider option that we were served inferior products.Pasta was cooked al dente and it didn't absorb taste of the seafood with which was served.Despite very attentive service, I doubt I will eat in this restaurant again
5
Was invited by a colleague of mine to this "new" restaurant at Intercontinental. I really has to say the service and the food at Ash & Elm really exceeds my expecatiotions.I had the lobster soup to start and the pork as a main. The staff was very attentive and helpful in regards to recommend bot food and wines.Will definitely come back on my next visit to Singapore
5
A great place to spend with family & & friends.Cozy setting.Heavenly Food at Earthly pricing.Went with a group of 8 friends .Meat platter , Appetisers and Chocolate Pizza a must Try. Seafood Linguine outstanding .To top it all Class Service by professional team .5 stars to Selva and Kanako for excellent service. .Will be back definitely.

I remember the old Olive Tree Restaurant here when they had Tappas and all was pretty good. Every change since has been detrimental and intended to save cost rather than provide something sepcial or indeed particularly good.The new partial buffet is where you choose a main course (fish, chicken, flatbread (aka pizza) or veggie). And it's just OK. Its not special, does not stand out, just average. The buffet selection fro starters is barely adequate (the best thing is the charcuterie). the breads could be interesting but overly sweet or salted or both depending on your choice. The desserts... not really worth a mention. Cheese (next to the charcuterie) is a decent and interesting selection.Indeed without the charcuterie and cheese this would have warrented a "terrible" score.It's a let down
3
I ordered some in for room service. I got myself a burger and it was overcooked and underseasoned. I'd rather go across the street and grab some Big Mac at McDonalds. The food that my wife got supposedly was good but I didnt bother to take note as I was too disappointed to care
4
My wife and I have differing opinions about this restaurant. She loved it whereas I thought it was ok but no more. The restaurant service is really good and the food was really enjoyable but the restaurant just lacked a bit of soul. It was a Saturday night and there were only a few small groups booked in and the restaurant just felt empty and lifeless. It is a bit dark inside which probably didn't help.If you want good food and service the restaurant is a good choice but it may just leave you wanting for more
5
If your first visit here is good (and it will be) then your second visit will be even better. Why?Because the staff and management that operate this restaurant will something extra the second time which is a warmth and application for your return custom.We visited in January 2016 and when we returned in April we were remembered, warmly greeted and thanked for returning. Plus in spite of a 3 month gap the supervisor Selva. Still recalled the drinks and small details we liked, without computers to aid him just a sharp brain interested in delivering good customer service. The food It is simply perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.Normally I dislike restaurants where you can see the kitchen operate. However this kitchen is so clean and so well run it's like watching a live edition of master chef. What's amazing is that they deliver such precision with virtually no noise. To watch how the younger chefs put the food in the plates like they are following a detailed building plan is a delight to look at. The effort they put in to presentation mean food that looks amazing, but there is no point it looking good if it doesn't taste good and I can assure you it tastes very good. If you like nice uncomplicated yet still sophisticated and above all tasty food you should give it a try.

We stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel, but breakfast wasn't include with our reservation. The first morning we ate at Ash & Elm - ordering from the menu versus an over-priced buffet. The food came to us luke warm to cold and just so-so. We found eating at McDonald's the second morning was better food and much better price.

Well, I do not want to share with this experience. Expensive in relation to quality, awful food dot
5
A very nice and exclusive restaurant in the Intercontinental Hotel. We went there twice and we got exactly what we expected. Not to cheap, but reasonable. To have a dinner there is an experience and you will enjoy. The dishes are excellent, nicely presented and the staff is very friendly. To be recommended
3
We had a la carte breakfast which took forever. There were a lot of business groups and our table was quite hidden in the way back. Our server kept forgetting us. The food was very tasty
5
We were a large group of 24, spread over 3 tables, so it could have been very challenging to serve all of us at the one time, but the staff ensured that each table all received their meals within a few minutes of each other. The food was delicious, our table shared the Ash & Elm platter and then I had the scallops with cauliflower puree. I would thoroughly recommend eating here
5
We had a birthday party today. The beef tasting, $108, with 3 types of steak, a ribeye, a tenderloin and a flank steak, was fantastic. The pumpkin and bacon flatbread was also very good. Ambience is very nice also. Staff is friendly and helpful. All in all a very good dining experience.
5
We had Valentine's Day dinner at Ash & Elm whilst staying at the Intercontinental.We were blown away by the service, the menu and the quality of the food. It was a set menu night but still had enough variety to keep us very happy. The theatre of the sweets presentation was icing on the cake!Highly recommend for an affordable Valentine's Day in Singapore
4
this is an excellent place I would recommend. The service is good and the variety of food is also there
5
Had a lovely dinner at Ash & Elm after a busy day sightseeing. The staff were helpful and professional and knew the menu well.

This restaurant is downstairs near the lobby lounge. A little pricey but delicious food and a good wine list.

Very good
I see that the old one is little bit better
I had here now a new year break fast
Which start in 5Am to 5 Pm
Great food and fantastic service in Ash & Elm
Also marvelous staff

I was surprised that a new restaurant is at the place where Olive Tree restaurant was. We decided to try and found out that this new restaurant serves nice food and with very good service too. We are very impressed by the prompt and perfect services shown by Mr Selva that night. He's so helpful and proper.

The service of Ash & Elm matches that of a 5-star Intercontinental Hotel. The food and service exceeded our expectations. We eat at many fine dining restaurants, and sometimes you feel like it's worth it, other times you feel ripped off (whether it be poor food or service). Ash & Elm is worth the price for the food and service. We came here after dinner, just wanted to share some small bites and quiet time. The restaurant on a Sunday night was very quiet, so we got extra special attention and enjoyed a nice long conversation.We ordered a charcuterie plate and a cheese plate. The extra special attention? Besides the very polite service, the chef threw in a complimentary bread basked of 5 different breads with unsalted *and* salted butter. Yum! Also, the chef added another small cheese to our order, which was kind. Besides these generous unexpected freebies, the food was very good. The iberico ham was melt in your mouth. For our cheese plate, besides the usual fig paste and grapes, there were dried raspberries which I ate like candy. Ash & Elm's magic turned our casual bite to a wonderful romantic evening
5
Situated at downtown Singapore and easily accessible by MRT, Ash and Elm at Intercontinental Hotel is a high-end European restaurant with an excellent dining ambience. The quality of the dishes does live up to expectation arising for the price that you pay. We were particularly impressed with the service and the truly nice ambience. This is the place for brithday/anniversary of your loved ones
5
My friends and I booked a table for our Christmas gathering and we have a fabulous time. The restaurant creates a comfortable environment for us to catch up and the service from Selva was impeccable, he anticipate our needs and offered us accordingly. The food was of great quality and we even get to speak to the Executive Chef when he mingle with the guests. This will be the perfect spot for business, families and friends. Such a great improvement from the previous Olive Tree.

I had breakfast in this restaurant several times and dinner once.The breakfast spread is enormous and caters to everybody's choice!I had dinner one night in the Ash & Elm restaurant. I ordered the half rack of lamb with Gratin Dauphinoise and steamed asparagus, and a glass of very nice Shiraz red wine. The lamb was the best I have ever eaten in my life. It was so tender and tasty. The Gratin Dauphinoise was delicious and the asparagus was done to perfection.I did not have a desert. Bravo to this lovely restaurant and thank you
4
Foie gras was melt in the mouth delicious. Complementary bread basket with herbed and plain butters was really good too. We ordered the Tomahawk steak to share and they accommodated us by splitting it in two and cooking it medium rare and medium to suit both of us. It was cooked to perfection. It's too much meat for two, there is enough to share between three people. All of the staff was attentive and service was good. Overall, it was a really enjoyable meal. BTW, if you are staying in the hotel you get a discount if you charge the meal to your room
