I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. It was a bit bland though, have definitely had better hokkien mee!

So hard to catch them open. The hokkien mee tastes above average but I guess when business owner doesn't care about customers, I can go elsewhesre.

This stall does it so well. Rather bare looking dish compared to other hokkien mee but yum yum, they are so worth the calories

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish, anywhere in the western world this could cost 400% more than what they charge. Quality is top notch, hot off the wok.You order at the counter, they ask you for your table number then when its cooked they'll deliver it to you at this hawker centre.Delicious noodles with fresh ingredients

I have visited old airport road hawker many times but never managed to try this. There is forever a long queue and one time they told me that I have to wait at least one hour. Was there early 11 am on a weekday, there was still a short queue. $5 small and $8 medium. The hokkien mée was excellent. It’s the wet type. Prawns and sotong was generous and fresh. Worth the wait!

This is so bad, I don't know where to start.... and expensive $5 per plate minimum....bland prawns and cuttlefish - If u must try thin bee hoon version - Ah Hock at CHOMP CHOMP is better.For purist like me - thick bee hoon and yellow noddles then pls visit " COME DAILY" at #02-27 Lor 1 Toa Payoh, Singapore 310127.I've been eating this over 3 generations and still the BEST!!

Tried Hokkien Prawn Noodles here. Stir-fried with a stock made of prawn heads and pork bones, the gloriously messy Hokkien prawn noodles is replete with yellow noodles, vermicelli, prawns, squid, pork belly, egg and fried pork lard. While its origin remains vague, it is said to be first sold by Hokkien sailors at Rochor Road in post-war Singapore

Nam has been at Old Airport Haeker Centre ever since. I have been a regular ever since. Why I think this is the best hokkien fried mee in Singapore? The small beehoon!Just like nasi lemak is not nasi lemak with chicken wing (sic its not original)Other hokkien mee uses thick (chor) beehoon. Somehow that changes the taste. Balance is another factor - you can taste all the ingredients on the plate especially the beehoon. I have just eaten plate and am watching the orders filtering in. Humongeous amount of orders. Especially take aways. Accolades? Many many

The fresh prawns inside the Hokkien Fried Mee is one the many reasons that you will definitely NOT MISSED this dish.Though waiting time can be longer than usual but the stall owner ensure that all prawns are freshly-cooked and ready-to-eat. The gravy in the Hokkien Fried Mee is simply saliva-dripping good

This is a well established stall and perennially popular. However you have to take a chance that the stall may not be open when you visit as the stall is sometimes closed without notice. Open for lunch only.

The Hokien Mee here is delicious. I believe they only open for lunch cos I never see them open for dinner. I heard they sell until sold out!

I love the hokkien mee very much. It located in non AC kopitiam near Aljunied MRT.
SGD 5 for the small portion or SGD 8 for the medium one. Good value.

This is my favourite fried hokkien mee by far. My family has been enjoying this delicious hawker fare for many years. The texture and taste of the noodles are simply exquisite, and different from other hokkien fried mee. Waiting time could be more than 30 minutes during lunch time, but it is well worth the wait

This is a crowd's favourite and it might take you a few visits before you get to enjoy a plate of the famous Hokkien Fried Mee. It took me two visits. The opening hours are 9am-8pm but it usually finishes around 2-3pm. They will sell till they sold out. I find that being there early usually works. No reservations. It's located at a food court and the stall is right at the back, but no worries, just follow the crowd. They give you nice big prawns, and the noodles was neither too wet or too dry. Be there or be square

Have enjoyed their food when it was still at the former Lim Tua Tou hawker centre cum wet market along Upper Serangoon Road. It was truly an enjoyable treat with no long queues and 'tiau ke' (stucked-up)attitude shown by current staff. While the offd is still good, the stall's rest days are rather ad-hoc. So when making a trip there be prepared with an alternative option as the stall may just decide to close on that day

This food stall is busy. People constantly ordering numerous orders of hokkien mee for take-away as well as numerous folk calling in orders. It was worth the wait however. Good wok stir-fried noodles. The accompanying condiments of fish sauce, chilies, and lime went well with the noodles
