Waffle was light and crispy and chicken meat inside was juicy too! Recommended light bite if you come here for more than just ice cream and waffle.

Popular with students on weekdays afternoon, good for families to chillax during weekends. Like the matcha latte with ice cream and ice chocolate. The waffle is crispy too. Chicken in a waffle is savoury and nice. Price point affordable as there is no gst and service charge. Go for top up card option if you are coming frequently as 10% additional value is accorded. We became a regular after recent discovery

This is a simple ice cream shop tucked in the Tampines hdb estate. The ice cream flavours are quite standard but they have some interesting ones like coconut, durian and smurfie. Taste is on the sweet side, BT overall it's not too bad. The waffle servings are quite small though.. so it's hardly enough for 2 scoops of ice cream. We had some Groupon deal, so the price was pretty reasonable.
