Was great food, quick service and friendly!
Was shopping in Suntec City and came across the restaurant and really wanted a steak and they delivered just that!
5
Ive been to Tony romas to try the ribs and the feeling is great. Difinitely the first restaurant in singapore who offer ribs.
5
Food was delicious and the environment was nice and quiet. Even though there was a lot of customers we were able to catch up on old times without having to try and outshout the customers close by. The staff were tentative to your needs, the food was tasty and the prices were reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant for you next meal out

I enjoyed having lunch at Tony Romaâ€™s Suntec on a weekday.It is a great place to chat with your lunch kakis over their signature succulent ribs. Though they should bring back their corn-on-the-cob and broccoli side dishes.They often provide discounts too, hence the bill usually comes out quite reasonably
5
We've been here a few times over the years, and I think we will keep coming back. The ribs are still excellent and the prices are reasonable for for what you get. Service is decent too. Unless you've got a massive appetite I suggest only getting a "half-slab" of the ribs, because otherwise you'll struggle to finish it all. I've also had steaks here in the past and they were very good too
3
The food was just to much tart ( slight sour). Had original baby back ribs, shrimp & scallop pasta, caesar salad, honey lime shrimp salad - was jut too tart for my liking. The ribs were not juicy - very little sauce and was somewhat disappointed. Coleslaw was sour tasting
4
What impress me the most is the service rendered by the crews at Tony Roma's. There is this serving crew which is very helpful and welcoming. It's my first time here and he explained patiently to me on the different types of sauces for the ribs as well as the drink promotion available. I had little difficulties in understanding him as I think he is not a local here. Beside this, I observed that he went to the extend of offering a promotion card (consists of 25% discount on first visit) to the other table near me. The promotion card is available at the entrance which I managed to pick up out of curiosity. He has no benefit gains from offering any of these. It's his service attitude and kindness that strike me most. I doubt one can find such service elsewhere here.He even came and thank me and my gf personally while we were leaving. The name tag was small as such I could not identify his name.I requested a glass of warm water for my gf from another lady serving crew (who seem to be a manager). She even come forward to offer me another glass of ice water without my request. Awesome team. Keep it up!The food is all right. Good. Big portion. Shared with my gf.

We were there on a Friday night at 7pm. It did not allow us to make any reservations but it was not crowded when we were there anyway. We had the baby ribs and fish & fries. I must say the ribs were tasty and tender. The fish was okay but it came with a terrible tasting tartar sauce. The French onion soup was not so bad. Staffs were friendly and polite. So if you have cravings for ribs, this is the place to go
1
The ribs were hard, dry and tasteless, unlike the other location which is good. The chicken tenderloins oily, and steaks poorly prepared and dry. Working near by we went several times and always a big disappointment. Clearly the kitchen has a major cooking problem. Service was indifferent and unprofessional, with servers that do not understand about food . We prefer the other location and will not return
3
We had our 4th of July dinner at Tony Roma's. The food was generally ok. We ordered the family combo: the steak was juicy and tender, the ribs were rich in flavour but the chicken was a bit blah. The chicken wing was a let down as it tasted more like chicken nuggets. What stood out was the service: quick and efficient. Very professional
4
Fortunately we arrived early as it was packed – a popular place for locals and tourists alike. Meat dishes were enormous so go with a heathy appetite. Staff very professional and helpful.
4
Service by young, attentive staff. Nothing spectacular, but if you want to sit in air conditioning, and rehydrate from the Singapore sun, it fits the bill.
5
One of the best ribs in Singapore. Started with delicious onion loaf. Ceasar salad is perfect. Main course must be their barbecue baby back ribs. Finger licking good. Would be good to have beer but have to settled for soft drinks. Ambience is perfect for families and couples.
4
We tired and hungry. Every restaurant in Suntec city with fountain view was crowded. So we decide to have early dinner at Tony Roma's. Actually we have this restaurant back at Jakarta. But the taste was never failed us and the taste was better here compare the one in Jakarta.
5
We had a group of 50 loud adults and kids for dinner on Saturday night. There was a set dinner option for both kids & adults which was yummy, economical & plentiful. Everyone was happy. The staff were so accommodating of our demanding group & made it super easy. The ribs were amazing!
4
A friend recommended me to Tony Roma's baby back ribs, I went there for lunch with my brother, I ordered a platter of baby pork back ribs, when the dish was served, I noticed that it was overburnt, Good that the staff offered to replace a new ribs. I very appreciate the good service quality of the staff.The ribs was nice
1
Nothing was good about this place. The service was horrible and the food worse. I sat around whilst the staff ignored me for the most part and it was not busy. My ribs looked like the were boiled and then had a bit of sauce on them.
1
Are here tonight with a colleague as it is near my hotel.Ordered ribs and a salad. Salad was served first and immediately found a hair in the food.Informed our server and the supervisor and Manager that we were very upset and how unhygienic the place must be.They offered to replace the salad and compliment the dinner. When the bill came, the only would give us a free salad.Avoid this restaurant 
5
Dropped in for a quick dinner on New Year's Eve and was sat down then served very quickly. My SO and I decided to share a full rack of ribs. We got the spicy rub ribs which were amazing, tangy with a kick of spiciness and it was delicious. The ribs were succulent and off the bone. The sides that came along with it was good too, we had the fries and coleslaw. Fries being fresh out of the fryer and coleslaw tasted fresh
4
We ordered a platter that comes with pork ribs and steak. We ordered baby pork ribs and the meat was tender and soft. the steak is well marinated and the meat was tendered too. The portion is quite big and more than enough for 2 people
4
Applause for the staff good customer services! We have 18 of us for lunch and they can correctly served each of our orders individually. However the food taste is average.
4
Came here for lunch. The ribs are nice but the fries is just average. Service was ok. Crispy chicken was nice. Price is on the high side.
4
Ribs were outstanding. The ambience is great. They offer tapwater which is nice. The medium portion is big for a adult. Such things would come with a price so be mindful.
3
I have eaten in this place a dozen times and find their food inconsistent. Some days, the ribs are so good... But some day, the ribs tasted as if it was left there for some time and reheated.
5
Went to restaurant and found it to be well worth going, in fact we went back 3 times. The staff were very friendly and enthusiastic to ensure you had a good evening. The service was excellent and nothing was too much if you wished to vary your order from the menu. I would highly recommend going there
2
Dear Tony, the service was so amazing. Amazingly bad. We waited to be seated, but waited very long before we were noticed because the staff worked with their heads down. Same thing later on when we tried to order. With service like this, I saw more than one group tempted to leave, and we were also one of them.
4
A little heavy on the seasoning but the baby back pork ribs were excellent. Baked potato was a run away champ and for the first time in a long time, excellent brocolli, that's crunchy and filled with natural goodness no flavourings. Bonus - their cocktails are a MUST!Really bad service tho, most of them are kids. Still, you will get served if you holller and be friendly, they just doing what they were trained to do
4
Went there twice. Early aug and end august with Groupon vouchers. The food portion was generous and there were ice water for free. Must try food are onion loaf - lotsa of onions stacked and fried together, crispy. Another is the grilled spinach chicken stack - marinated chicken with spinach and cheese on the chicken, includes yellow rice which was also tasty. The service was good and attentive. Recommended for casual dinner with friends or colleagues. Fuss free experience
2
I found the food and service decidedly average at best I think that a well known brand like this shouldn't even be in Singapore if they cannot replicate the well known menu items and service, it's just wrong and misleading. No disrespect meant to the staff who were polite and did their bes
4
I was at several Tony Roma's locations, even in the silicon valley.The rib's are always very good, tasty. I normally having potatoes skin and appetizer and it's always a pleasure.This location has been refurbished not too much time ago, and here there is the only negative point. The shape of the room is a bit strange and there are many blind spots. When you're seated there, it's quite difficult to attract the attention of the personnel, and the waiting time will become too much long in receiving assistance. People there are doing their best, but when there is the peak time this issue is becoming a problem.This is something does not occur at Orchard Central, everything is very open and assistance is coming in a short time even during critical hours.I'm very sure the management will take action to remove this problem
5
Best restaurant in Suntec city. Have been here four or five times and always order the ribs. Great service and reasonable prices.
3
A little let down by our most recent visit.....
The Rib Eye that I ordered was certainly not a Rib Eye cut.
Taste was good though.
Serves have gotten smaller as has the restaurant itself.
Service was good and food was presented promptly.
3
Tony Roma's quality has dropped quite a bit since its hayday when throngs of people would queue for it.
Our party ordered 3 half baby back ribs which were a little dry. It still tasted sweet with the classic barbeque sauce.
Drinks here are expensive.
3
Food acceptable, service just about average, 50/50 mix of staff with friendly attitude or downright 'why are you spoiling my day by being here' types. Steak was slow in coming (25 minutes) although restaurant not busy. Good thing was it tasted great and drinks were served (different person) efficiently and happily. Was dissapointed as I regularly use TR around Asia and have good impression overall
1
I like Tony Roma's worldwide but this place was BAD!! The ribs came out dry and tough with little if any sauce. The chicken appetizer in barbeque sauce seemed to have microwaved, tasted bad and was mostly fried dough with little chicken inside, Yuk! The Service was unfriendly and indifferent. Food quality of bad fast food and restaurant high prices. The server didn't care to ask about the food. I will stay away
4
we order a platter consists of one ribeye steak, 2 portion of ribs, 2 chicken breasts 4 corn combs and some crow slaw. the steak is done perfectly and the ribs are full of flavour. we had some mushroom soup to start. the soup is really fresh.love it.2 persons we spent 90
4
Had the mixed steak n ribs combo. Sides must try the mash potatoes, the baked potato a bit too dry. Taste still the same and portions are enough considering the sides. Price wise still slightly higher than other western restaurants. Must try the mushroom soup, thicker than most served elsewhere, creamy and tasty. Can be served hotter. Service was good n prompt n attentive. Will return again.
4
Our group of four visited the Orchard Central outlet on a Friday evening. As we were there early, we did not have to queue for seats. We were shown to our seats and waited for the rest of the group. While waiting, we were not offered any drinks. It was until much later that a young waitress finally asked if we would like to order any drinks.We ordered our food when the rest arrived. When we were served the appetizer, I noticed that unlike in our many previous visits, we were not served the complimentary bread and garlic butter. When I asked the waiter if they still served the bread, he then brought a small loaf for us. We ordered the Carolina Honeys ribs, the steak and fish combo and the burger.I found that for the price of $34.90++ the steak and fish combo was not worth it, as the portions are very small, especially for the fish. Both the steak and fish tasted dry even though the steak was cooked medium. The ribs are tasty and it is always my favourite, as well as the potato skins appetizer.The restaurant manager is attentive. He asked the waiter to bring us wet tissues when he noticed that none were placed on the table.Overall, service is good, we just need to get their attention.When we finished our meal, a long queue had formed outside the restaurant
1
Having been in this region for three weeks we decided it was time to try some western food. New York strip sounded good but was a disaster. Full of sinews and only a couple of decent mouthfuls. Careful dissection released more meat but only in tiny pieces. The prawn salad was tasteless. Service mediocre: disinterested and chaotic. An expensive flop for the two of us
4
We came for both the ribs and beef. We found the baby back ribs decent but the pork ribs that they cook with is nothing compared to what you can get from the U.S. However, the ribeye was delicious and above average. Desserts were a let down. Will come back for the ribeye
4
The food was very good and tasty, not "high end" but if you enjoy rib's with a good crust and spicy taste you are right here.
3
American styled food with a price tag to match, service was average and food was nothing special, c minus.
5
Whenever we are in Singapore, we will go and have ribs at Tony Roma's. We absolutely love their red hot ribs and are looking forward to having them during our yearly visits to Singapore. The restaurant in Suntec City Shopping Centre is clean with fast service and great tasting food. We would love to have a Tony Roma's in our home city of Melbourne, Australia, but alas, we will need to keep going to Singapore to have the joy of eating the world's best ribs!
3
i've been here a few times and it was mostly 'ok' and i never had to queue (as i usually go during working hours) but the last time i was there it was pretty disappointing. i ordered for 2 medium rare steaks as i was treating someone for her birthday. her steak came ok, but mine was over - it was more on the medium, medium well side. so i had it sent back. when it came back, it was rare. so i asked the waiter again to pop it back in for a few minutes. it's not worth queuing 30 minutes for this
5
It's one of my favorite restaurants when it comes to grill baby back ribs. They have several outlets in Singapore. First they will serve you a loft of crusty bread and garlic butter which is good. I ordered half slab of baby back ribs, you can choose 2 sides from many choices such as corn, coleslaw, fries, baked potatoes etc. they also serve other main course such as steak, seafood etc. appetizers like buffalo wings are available too. It nice and delicious the food here.
3
Everytime, we visited TR there's always a worry on the service, tendency of waiters not around or hard to locate them whenever we needed them. Either they cluster around each other or we cant see them at all. It's playing hide & seek. Also the staff turnover is super fast, very hard to find the same staff each time we visit. We usually order the same old identical dishes in our every visit & the ribs are getting drier, like biting into a learher belt. Our daughters remarked that the standards have dropped alot comparing to their younger days in early 2000. Hope management can help improve the food quality & also with staf retention so that it's easier to meet same staff in our future visits, eapecially those whom we have built up good rapport & they are familiar to our dining needs
5
Most visits to Singapore means a visit to Tony Roma's. Love their baby back ribs. Not cheap but worth the price. Located just off the food republic in the basement at suntech and can take a bit of finding. They close between lunch and dinner during the week but stay open during the weekend which is great as I like to miss the peak times in chain restaurants or food halls.
4
I don't usually patronise such places all the time, because I know these places are expensive. Decided to try this place last week to see if it's really as good as it was hyped.We ordered a Roma Feast - suitable for two adults (and a hungry toddler). The food was delicious, and the portion generous. I think there is a generous dose of preservatives and seasoning for the dish. Food came pretty fast, and presented nicely on a plate. My wife and kid enjoyed it very much.Would I go back again to try? Maybe, but only if we are going to celebrate special occasions. Won't want to go back too often because of the prices
4
This is especially true for those from Malaysia as even though Tony Roma's does have outlets in Malaysia, they only serve beef ribs.If you are in for old traditional baby-back ribs, look no further just head on down to Tony Roma's in Suntec or Orchard Hotel. You will now be disappointed.If you want a larger and cosier setting, head to on the one in Suntec. After all, it's the best ribs in town
2
Having eaten in the USA several times we decided to eat here during a recent holiday. Ordered onion loaf which was great starter for three. Ribs were AMAZING - tried a sampler (3 of each) to try them all - well worth ordering.However unlike the U.S. Stores (and the Hard Rock in Singapore) the coke and soda are not bottomless and you gave to pay for every glass. We did not expect this as you pay $4.50 for a single SMALL glass!! This is the worst value we gave EVER seen. Take care!We found a poster with a voucher in the Suntec City underpass. Showing our server before ordering was not enough and at one point thought we'd have to go and scan it again! I think the restaurant may be having financial difficulties and are desperate for every $???
5
it's not very cheapbut..You must try the Baby Pork Ribs, mashed potato, and friench fries.. it's the best in town...
3
we had dinner here. We ordered the family feast which consists of Carolina honey ribs served with bbq chicken, fried shrimps, corn and coleslaw. We also ordered deep fried calamari rings served with garlic sauce for dipping. The baked potato soup is so yummy. We will definitely be back for more
5
Tony Romas Pork Ribs in Singapore is bigger, more juicer and more delicious than the one in Jakarta. You could start with the soup (French Onion soup, mushroom soup or corn soup, they are all delicious). If you go in a group you could have a Tony Romas sampler as starter. The recommended Pork Ribs is Carolina Honey, if you order one full slab, it could be shared by 2-3 persons... for 1 person half slab is big enough. The regular slab can be shared by 2 persons. One order comes with 2 side dishes which can be French fries, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, corn, brocolli and cole slaw. You could also order one big jar of lemon tea for 3-4 persons... as the dessert you must try Scillet Cookies (chocolate cake with vanila ice cream on top)... it is very sweet so one portion can be shared by 4 persons...It is a must restaurant to go when you are in Singapore, it is advisable to go there during lunch time, because if you go there for dinner you will be very full because the size of the portion is quite big ... they also serve beef, chicken and fish..

4 of us came in today at 6pm & premise was empty, just 4 customers in sight. Jack attended to us & Jack was good, polite, helpful, informative & efficient. Our fav fried calamari didnt turn out as good as we expected as were in the past many times. What's worst was it came wt a sourish BBQ sauce instead of Tartar sauce. It was crispy no doubt but its bland, not tasty at all. Then, came a humongous bowl of Ceasar Salad which looks fresh & crunchy but tasteless when bitten. A quarter way through, we gave up this salad. We love & enjoy eating salads, most types in fact but this one was an utter disappointment. For the last & past 18 years, my two girls & family loved the corns from TR. It's always juicy & sweet when we sank our teeth into it. But not today's, where did the sweetness gone to?the bread is still nice, crusty on the outside & soft in the inside. The let-down as compared to the past is the size of the bread has miserably dwindled to 40% its former 'glory' size. And our fav savory garlic butter has shrunk to a pathetic gold ball size. So stingy, might as well dont offer at all. We had the original baby backs, as usual & as always, a full slab. The meat is still maintained in excellence, juicy inside & tender when bitten. The sauce is still as good as it always was & will be (I hope so). Must thank Jack & Ming Siang for their attentive, courteous & helpful services.

Had been shopping in SunTec today and was looking for somewhere for lunch. We decide to go to Tony Roma's. There were not too many people in so getting a table was easy. To our horror there was a group of people that appears to be celebrati a birthday. That in itself was no problem it was the goup of maybe 9 or 10 kids that I would estimate between the ages of 4 to 10. They were literally running around being incredibly noisy and annoying the life out of all the other diners. I don't for one minute blame the ill-mannered kids. I blame the parents who didn't bat an eye lid. I did complain to the serving staff who did nothing more than tell me they should be leaving soon. Thankfully after fifteen minutes they finished and left. And now for the food... We ordered the sharing appetiser and when it eventually arrived the 3 items on it ranged from luke warm to cold. I sent it back and we waited anotherfifteen minutes for a replacement to arrive. It was hot this time. For main course we ordered again a sharing platter. At least this arrived hot. The food is generally quite bland and would appear that nothing is really prepared using fresh ingredients. I'm guessing it's all pre-packaged and frozen. Oh I almost forgot. Our table looked into another room in the restaurant. This would appear to be a room that would be used to accommodate more diners during busy periods. It's seperated from the main restaurant by a glass partitioned wall with sliding glass doors. What was amazing was that during the course of our meal four different people (what I can only assume are staff members) went in to this room and lay down on the floor and covered themselves up with blankets. This in full view of diners. So to sum up...Service was average, food was bland and over priced. And the atmosphere was reminiscent of a primary school playground and a hostel.

Excellent ribs, great fries (made fresh from potatoes?), nice chicken breasts, good service - factors of a great restaurant. I'm glad the waiter is able to recommend the best $ savings by altering our side dishes orders as we ordered 2 main dishes (baby ribs and salmon) The food was excellent, my brother loved the chicken breast, cooked tender and tasty. Fries were made fresh also, with bits of potato skins still intact - loved it!! Baked potato is always my favourite food and the toppings on the baked potato was superb, though potato seemed like overbaked (too dry). Mashed potato was too dry without gravy (would be healthy dish). As we were seated in another room behind the restaurant, didnt provide much of ambience, waiters seemed to neglect this part of the restaurant, although they popped by occasionally to check us out. Overall, excellent food, great service. I ate till i cant finish my mango swirl drink! Thanks Tony Romas.

Brought my family of four to the SUNTEC branch for dinner. The queue was long (25 pax) but it moved quickly, waited for just 15 minutes. The ordering staff was new & spoke broken English but her right attitude & enthusiasm was most vital for us. Food came fast but all four of us felt that the food quality standards had nose-dived since our previous visits. The Original Baby Back ribs were bland in the inside despite much gluey tomatoey-tasting sauce on the outside. Seems like the ribs were either not marinated long enough or they were frozen meat. And the St Louis Ribs were so dry like biting into leather belts. So we hoped the corn Cob may uplift our frustrations but they turned up tasteless, not sweet as though the Brix is at a low 1 degree. Then, we turned to the coleslaw & was again disappointed as it had a strange bitter aftertaste. Oh yes, at the start we normally got a cutting board with the baguette & herb butter but this time round it was served in a paper cone instead. Kind of lost the novelty of a starter which was nostalgic over the last decade we patronized Tony Roma's.
1
We went into Tony Roma's early evening (17:00) at the end of May and were surprised to find only one other table occupied. We now know why! We were expecting the same high standards that we have in Australia. (The Perth one is always packed, has good food and good service). How wrong we were!! We had a trainee waiter who struggled to understand what we want and who later disappeared after serving one course. He was replaced by another. The food was really disappointing - My wife had a chicken salad and suffered later. I had the steak which was lukewarm and only just edible. We would not recommend this restaurant! There was a distinct air of 'could not give a stuff' among the staff that were on duty at the time
3
I had the St Louis Ribs with Bourbon sauce. The meat was rather tough (nothing compared to the ones at Naughty Nuri's in Bali that melt in the mouth)The bread was dry (may have been microwaved ?), tasted bland and dont seem to be fresh. The garlic spread was too salty (cannot beat the oven fresh bread and butter spread from Outback Steakhouses in Hong Kong)The baked potato was not fluffy and there is a tough layer just beneath the skin. Could use better quality potatoes.Serving size for a full slab was adequate for a couple. Cost about SGD 45 (including service and tax)Service was friendly and prompt
5
We arrived around 6:30pm but there's no staff bothered to give a look at the entrance while we waited for about 10 minutes. I reckon this aspect has to be highlighted to management because first impression is important & that will determine whether potential customers would walk away to eat elsewhere or be patient to wait. Anyway, once we were directed to our seats, the rest was splendid. We were so blessed to have waiter Charles serving us. He got our tables set up pretty efficiently & took our orders professionally with caring recommendations & detailed info of the dishes. Charles was pleasant, courteous & resourceful. Little did we know that he was actually a chef in the kitchen who knew exactly what he was taking about when he introduced us the items in the menu. He deserves every praise & appreciation. The food came promptly & he frequently topped up our glasses. My family enjoyed the way & manner Charles served us. We will definitely want to come back & look forward to have Charles serving us again.
2
Pretty non descript food, overpriced and far too sweet, much better steaks are available elsewhere at a more reasonable price. Would not visit again
4
We are going regularly to this chain. We love to eat baby pork ribs. The service is efficient. The price is acceptable. The decoration at the orchard restaurant looks old and not so clean.
3
As usual the food is always good at Tony Romas and service was average but waited over 40 min for my food due to the waitress forgetting to punch in our order. other than that it was okey....
4
located at the mall attached to the convention center. When you get tired of all the fish and rice and want old fashion american ribs this is the place to go. Great prices.
5
We went there during our recent trip to Singapore. It was my wife's choice really, as she's had Tony Roma ribs before and rates them the best she's ever tasted... and she wasn't disappointed this time either!I actually planned to order a steak but changed my mind at the last minute as the ribs sounded so tempting. It turned out to be a good decision! The only problem I had was deciding which flavour of ribs to choose so, in the end, I chose the sampler.We both loved the ribs but, with the portions (especially the sampler) being so large we struggled to finish them.Needless to say, we had to pass on dessert!I should have mentioned we started with a half onion loaf (believe me, it's big enough for two) which was really tasty. We washed the lot down with a half carafe of decent house red wine.This is another establishment in Singapore that adds 10% service charge to the bill but expects customers to pay an additional tip. This annoys me a little!Also, it's rather hard to find. Suntec City Mall is a big place and something of a "rabbit warren". Despite the signs, it's not easy to find you way around unless you're familiar with the place.However, despite these minor niggles, I think Tony Roma's is still worth it's rating of Excellent. Good value for money by Singapore standards though, you have to remember, finding good quality Western style food in Singapore is never going to be cheap
5
I was entertaining with clients during my visit to Tony Roma's. Tony Roma's is one of my favorite spots in the US and Canada and I was also thoroughly impressed with the Singapore branch. The staff is very well trained and courteous. The restaurant is extremely conducive to a business meal for a few reasons: the restaurant has a sliding glass door, which dramatically reduces the noise level that other restaurants experience in the Suntec passageway; the service is great and the food is excellent. I felt that my business was valued. My calamari Caesar salad was excellent as well. I would definitely use this restaurant for a business meal at Suntec
5
Just left Tony Roma's for our regular fix of great ribs! Being seasoned travelers I can say these are the BEST RIBS IN THE WORLD!! I have been going to this restaurant for probably 14 years and never been disappointed. Sadly the restaurant is about to move to another location, so I can only hope they keep up the great service and the fantastic ribs. Long live Tony Roma's
4
The food is very cooked - it is good comfort food. You can fill your belly up at a reasonable price given the size of the portions. I haven't tried the pork ribs (but my friends tell me that is quite decent), but the chicken (both the bbq and the southern) as well as the beef are very tasty. In terms of side, the sweet corn and the beans I found were the best.Definitely will continue going
5
I love the taste of it Baby Pork Ribs, always order full size for myself together with Tiger beer. It he best pork ribs I ever tasted, which my home land not allow to sell it in Tony Roma's restaurant. Price are reasonable and service are good and friendly. Nice place to hang out for couple, family, friends gathering
5
The service given met my expectations. Nice staffs, and attentive.Good ambience, and really love the taste of st. Louis ribs with bourbon sauce. Ribs was tasty, tender, all the ingredient blend really well to the ribsI pampered my self with a portion of onion ring, Crispy and yummy. The price was reasonable with the service and quality offered.Can do for family, or party time
4
Great appetizer, great service, nice interior, superb meal. We have the whole rib for two of us with french fries.
There was a queue in front of the restaurant but we didnt wait for too long.
4
Just what you would expect from this chain - good ribs etc in a shopping mall ambience. Waitress appeared to be on her first night but survived with discreet supervision.
Good choice if you seek something familiar and unadventurous.l
5
Have been in Singapore for three days and have just had a great meal everything cooked perfect -service brilliant
Alot better than the Black Angus last night
Great way to end the holiday
4
Doesn't look like much from the outside but the food was great! If you like ribs you can't go wrong. Would go again
4
Just love the pork ribs! And the mashed potato side dishes... Not too crazy about the gravy though... Love to visit again.
5
From many restaurant Itried, Tony Roma's is the best for Baby Back Ribs, and they taste is almost same in all outlet around the world. I like they spicy sauce and they onion ring. Also they fried Chesse and Santa Fe Salad
3
I think this place is a family restaurant, at least the food, crayons, drawing paper etc make it seem that way but it was one of the darkest stair ants I have ever been in. The food is fine and priced fairly reasonably but probably not somewhere I'd rush back to.
4
My husband and I have been staying at the orchard hotel for almost 2 months and it was not till yesterday that we decided to try this place out and it was because we were tired from a walk around town. We were pleasantly surprised, the food was amazing. Baby back ribs were awesome and the chicken with spinach and artichoke topping was also amazing. The place looks very out dated and just feels like we are eating in someone's basement . The service was terrible. I had to search multiple times for waiters. I never had one solid waiter just everyone doing random things for different tables. Either way, food was worth the outdated basement like atmosphere and terrible service.

Always enjoyed their baby bag ribs, however service level has dropped especially during my recent visit. Staff not knowledgable about their menu, had to ask several staff for explanation. Lousy calculative food policy, we ordered the starter that has cheese and salsa dippings, unlike Chilis we were asked to pay $3.50 for another round of tostada chips. It was very petty of them.

We recently had dinner at this restaurant during our visit to Singapore. We were walking along Orchard road and decided to go to Tony's for dinner. It was a bit of a walk and we arrived rather late and for this reason we were too hungry and forgot to take photos of our meal...:)The restaurant itself has a diner feel to it, but I think it has aged somewhat and seems like a restaurant from the yesteryear. For starters we ordered the Tony Sampler. This appetiser had BBQ Boneless Bites, their signature half onion loaf (good stuff) and the equally good spinach artichoke dip.We ordered the original ribs and it seemed to lack marinade and was less succulent compared to what I remember. In fact we felt parts of it were not BBQ enough so we got the waiters to redo the BBQ. Good thing was the waiters obliged our request. We then added on Carolina Honeys which was more meatier and was more succulent. The food was good in general but the restaurant seems aged and in need of refurbishment

Ribs and Onion Rings all piled up so high.... perfect combination! Nice ambience. Nice Racks (of ribs).

Quite cozy, very busy but service was immediate, polite and friendly. Our ribs were excellent, fell off the bone and remarkably enjoyable. Loved it.
5
Went to their restaurants several times. Have been to the one at Suntec and the one at Orchard road. Food quality is stable and simply love the ribs in their BBQ source there.
4
I ate two times at Tony Romas in Suntec. I had the burger which was well cooked and served with good fries. The staff are friendly.
They have renovated the restaurant. It looks way better than before.
4
A really good meal! Nice food and reasonable prices, service was friendly, attentive and fast.
Nothing to disappoint . Very good across the board.
5
Babyback ribs (full) is the way to go.. coleslaw isn't as good as back home though probably because of the type of mayo used.... Ribs n chips make up for it though. They do not make a good mojito.
4
Good location since I stayed in the Pan Pacific Singapore. Great atmosphere and food is excellent. Sometimes its hard to find a table so you have to wait? Service was ok but I felt the waitress were unfriendly .

The ribs did not really amaze me much, since I ate better ones and at a cheaper price even. The food sold there are rather pricey, but it was still quite good. Service was not really prompt, that's probably cos I went there when they were just an hour away to close the restaurant.I wanted to order coffee, those normal mocha will do, cos I was pretty sleepy and had to work thru the night. I saw the menu and ordered an Almond Mocha, it costs $9.90 which shocked me. But I thought it was gonna be special, since it was under the heading of 'Special coffee (something like that , can't remember)'. In the end, it turned out to be an alcoholic coffee. I asked for the waiter, and the waiter pointed out that a certain ingredient which they stated in the menu for description of the coffee, was a kind of alcohol. Being somebody who don't drink alcohol as much, how would I know that was alcohol? I was thinking if it was some kind of special nut's name. The waiter then said that the section of 'Special coffee' was actually all alcoholic coffee. If that was so, shouldn't the menu state that there's alcohol in it, to have a disclaimer for that section, and not only stating what types of alcohol are included in each type of coffee? I may not know all the alcohol names right? That explains the price of $9.90 for a cuppa coffee.All in all, the thing that kinda pissed me was just the alcoholic coffee issue. The food was good, but I just feel that it's a little too costly. Would not frequent this restaurant

I must say I'm not a fan of pork ribs but I find Tony Roma's ribs absolutely delicious. The restaurant is located in the basement of Suntec City which is not easy to find for first-timer. Having said, once you've settled with a seat inside you would find a lovely and chillax ambience with helpful waiters.I usually order half a BBQ rib which comes with side dishes such as fries, wedges, rice or beans. The ribs are well seasoned and the portion is so big that I hardly could finish all for every trip to Tony's that I made. My partner often opts for beef steak which is nicely cooked too. The chicken is dry and plain; however, so I wouldn't recommend it. Apart from that, other dishes are up to standard
2
We have eaten at Tony Roma's before and this one just doesn't measure up to their standards or ours. The food was poor with the ribs being very dry like day old food. This restaurant chain has built a reputation on excellent food at a moderate price. The price was moderate but the food was not. Compounding the food experience was poor service. Sitting for twenty minutes to get a server is unacceptable. The experience has certainly dimmed our chances on a return to this chain

Pork ribs in Jack Daniels flavor taste the best! UOB cardmembers buy 3 main course free 1main course and when I was there on 28th Dec, our receipt stated if u fill up the questionare online, you get free half rack baby ribs. :)
2
Was there about more than a year
No queue at all
Waiting quite long for food to be served
Poor service n food average but price is not worth paying
The portion of food have shrunk!
5
I simply love the way Tony Roma does their St. Louis Ribs! Tender and juicy and well-seasoned. It's simply too tasteful to describe! Their ribs are a must have if you are a pork lover ;)
5
Tony Romas is in the same building as the hotel. The resturant is very clean and refreshing. Everyone is very profesional and accomodating. A really relaxing place after a long day at work.
5
Found this Tony Roma's tucked away in a corner of Suntec Mall. The menu is the standard Tony Roma's found throughout the world. The food was up to the same standard - the ribs were excellent and the potatoes were, as usual, delicious. Service was prompt and polite. One note - the gratuity is included in the bill so there is no need to leave an additional tip (unless you really want to)

Went to Tony;s last night we had the "feast "extra special sausage,chicken as tender as can be ,Fried shrimp with coleslaw deliciously moorish,and Ribs that just melted in your mouth,The food is exy and very tasty,the service however was slow and our booking didn't seem to help with our seating,Over all though the food tenderness and extra tastyness made up for any inconvenience .3 stars

Whenever I am in Singapore, I always make it a point to dine here as the one in Malaysia is "halal" and does not serve baby back ribs aka pork (they serve beef). The onion loaf (SGD9.90) is to die for, as with the ribs, which literally fall off the bone! I packed one serving to go for my friend as well. I love the corn on the cob as they are imported corn and is soooo succulent (I slather the herbed butter served with the bread on it). Baked potato as a side dish makes a better choice than fried side dishes although calories-wise, I am not too sure it is healthier! The one at Suntec City is still open although re-located to the G floor, which is a different location from the past (?). There is another one at Orchard, though I have never tried that one. Staff are friendly and efficient. A pity they don't accept reservations, though

We visited the Suntec establishment for the first time. The ambience was terrible. Very dark, furnishings were dated. It reminded us of a travel lodge motel that has not been refurbished for 20 years.We ordered a kids meal of chicken nuggets and chips for our son. They were extremely hard and dry. I ordered the rib eye steak which was average. But the baby back ribs were delicious. Whilst we were very disappointed with the meal overall we would probably return for the ribs. One piece of advice is to go early if you don't want to queue. We arrived at 6pm and there were many tables but by the time we had finished our meal there was about 30 people outside in the queue.It is a very kid friendly place, they just need to the get the food right
2
We were taken here by friends recently and we were extremely disappointed. The restaurant was in the basement car parking area of the shopping centre next to fast food outlets. Inside the ambience was non existent and more suitable for a quick meal with kids than a night out with friends.Unfortunately the food was no better. Although my taster plate of 4 different ribs was huge it all tasted the same which was sweet,sweet,sweet. Very sickly and the chili beans exactly the same.My first and last Tony Roma experience
3
It has been some time since I visited the Orchard outlet, patronising the outlet in Suntec City more. Plans to visit Tony Romas usually have to be done in advance so as to arrange for the friends to meet earlier, to avoid the long queues. I have not been back to Tony Romas since their renovations though.Personally, I found the place a nice place to relax and unwind with friends. A place to chill... though... I would say... the air-conditioning regulation added to the Chill of the place.Food wise... is well worth the money. :

Eating alone is never fun - but the service and choice were very good and reasonably priced - also got ten % discount for being a "valued" customer - interesting as this was my first visit !!
4
Love the pork ribs, serving are big. But price liltle expensive. Been quite sometimes never visit the restaurant, but still remember their food is good.!
3
Just off Orchard Road this is not a great place to eat. Service was fine, though the food was just average and the bill expensive.
4
Always enjoy meals at Tony Roma's-good western food! Restaurant is located near Traders Hotel , Hard Rock Cafe off Orchard Street.
5
more than your best ribs in town. they serve excellent drinks and side dishes (like corn and baked beans) and their appetizers are amazing.
1
I love Tony Roma's and always go there any country I travel to, but at Suntec city they DO NOT KNOW WHAT SERVICE IS. The franchise should pull the license from these guys.
2
No service, no taste, and definitely not value for money!
5
this is comfort food at its best... i recommend the baby back ribs with corn
1
average microwave style food and terrible staff. being pushed out of the way just ain't the way to encourage more custom!
4
Location is not really friendly but the circle line (yellow MRT) made it easier. Yummy food with pretty big portion. Nice environment. Service is good. My husband loved the steak and I prefer the grill seafood. I recommend others to try. Tony Roma's is one of my family favorite restaurants in Singapore
3
The food is pretty much tried and tested Tony Roma's but the location is getting very old, a little dark.
5
ABSOLUTE best ribs eaten in singapore. really good for someone who loves pork ribs.
5
As always superb food and great service. Love the ribs and burgers and will return during my next visit to Singapore.
4
Not sure about other items but everytime I'm here, it's only ribs and nothing else.
5
all meat, but somehow wont get sick of it
3
The staff is nice and the location is clean, although it is not really amazing in there. The food is standard. The ribs are quitegood, but they (and the rest) areconvenience food as everywhere; just a bit more expensive. you can go there and be not disappointed, but that's all
4
Standard TR food, good as usual. Had some Baby back ribs. The only thing to criticize is that for the extra original sauce they give a small plate containing just a bit, so I kept asking for more I tried to explained that I wanted to have my own bottle but they looked at me as some kind of strange alien.SHOW ME THE SAUUUCEE!!
1
I should say I have never eaten ribs before, so they may just not be my thing. But these were greasy and tasted only of fat and whatever the 'goop' was on them. Poor side dishes too - sloppy coleslaw (very watery). DO NOT USE THE TOILETS - they are out in the attached hotel plaza and are FILTHY
3
The ribs are good, no doubt about it. Don't even think about anything else on the menu unless you want a dry, grey steak or chewy seafood. Staff range from disinterested to incompetent although now and again you get one that is switched on. They never seem to last though

Tony Romas is good for when our family fancy a big blowout meal - their ribs are usually very tender and the meat falls off the bone, our children like the chicken tenders and I love the big onion ring that they do. Downsides are that their salads aren't particularly good and sometimes they forget to cook your burger or steak how you've asked for it and you end up having to send it back (I think it is more lack of communication between the waiter and myself though as some of them don't speak very good English and I don't speak much Mandarin or Malay!). They do some good drinks offers sometimes and at the moment they're doing buy 2 get the 3rd free for cocktails. The kids meals are good value too with a drink included and you can upsize for $3 and they can get a coke/sprite float or a milkshake.Lastly, I'd advise taking a jumper, particularly if you go to the Suntec restaurant as it can often be freezing in there
