We ordered ginger beef and steamed rice take out which cost 22 sgd. It was expensive compared to hawkers' centre stalls, but the portion was quite large.
4
After a couple of disappointing meals elsewhere we were delighted with the quality and service of this restaurant. We will remember how much we enjoyed the meal at reasonable prices and will go back next time we are in Singapore.
4
We were directed upstairs where our waiter didn't speak English, but managed to deliver what we ordered - which was way too much for 2 people. Tasty food.

China friends brought me here and I was amazed at Szechuan cuisine. A must try specialty is stewed duck with konjac, the texture of konjac is surprisingly good.

Mind blowing good, tongue numbing delicious and just simply a gastromic heaven on earth. My first visit after my friends all raved the food to the heavens. We ordered the Chicken with dried chilli peppers 辣子鸡, stir fried spicy long beans 长江一号 and Spicy Boiled Fish 水煮鱼。 Everything was simply tasty. I can really take the heat so I initially asked for Medium level spicy but was dissuaded by my friends who have been there prior. They insisted that Low Spicy level was more than adequate. They were quite right. We had to control ourselves to not to eat so much rice but everything was just screaming to be matched with hot, steamed fragrant rice so we had quite a few helpings. Love the food. Will definitely be back!!

A crayfish dish (although small crayfish) combined with mushroom & bok choy, potato & lotus root, fried dumplings washed down with Tiger beer made an enjoyable evening after a long day pounding the footpaths of Singapore. Great taste and value for money. Ask for a table up stairs. Good service

after a very poor experience of expensive and bad food in food street for lunch we were keen to find something that locals would eat and came across this. the menu looked interesting and it was busy with locals even at 7pm which was a good sign. Food was great and lots of it - we were even told that the servings were large so don't order too much. We didn't take enough notice of the waitress though and over ordered. serves us right. Food tends to be spicy. they serve wine too at very reasonable prices for Singapor

This is a nondescript place on a pedestrian only road in Chinatown. Some friends had been telling me for a while that I really should try it. I was not disappointed.The food was excellent. We ordered pork wantons, chicken with dry red chili, a beef dish, shredded pork & a mushroom dish.The chicken with dry red chili was unlike anything I've ever had before. I've been in Singapore 20 years and this was the first time I've seen it served dry - without a gravy. It was amazing. Just be careful of the spice level ... it's HOT !!!The beef, pork and the mushroom dishes were also very good.When ordering, keep in mind that the portions are quite large.I'm going back again. If you are in Singapore, this is a must visit place
5
Turn left at the Chinatown station Pagoda St escalator exit and about 5 shops down you will find "Old Chendu" with the best chilli won tons ever,so good I had two servings and went back the next day for another two.A great little restaurant with cold beer.

On my last night in Singapore I wanted to try there famous Chili Crab. Having stayed in Chinatown I decided to to head on in to Old Chendu. Worst mistake I wish I turned around & got out!So upon entering I was ushered upstairs & sat down. I noticed the chili crab was $7/100g, so I enquirer what was the smallest crab. The waitress said it was 700g. As I only wanted to taste this dish I declined. Miraculously the crab shrunk 100g so I decided to bite the bullet. The food started to come out, they brought out these mini bread rolls & said to eat them with the crab sauce. Neither of us ordered these so we thought it may have been included with the crab..... no it was not! (Only discovered this upon paying the bill). As most would know eating crab is messy & challenging. I was given a pair of pliers, chopsticks & one wet one.After what seemed like a long time I gave up in defeat. As I now had chili sauce all over my hands I asked for another set one, the waitress said no it was too expensive & handed over napkins. Mind you the fricking crab cost me $45!!!. The napkins did nothing to help. I decided to wait until the one toilet was free to wash my hands prior to paying. The wait was long & the wait staff looked eager to get rid of us. Eventually another waitress handed me another wet one. The service was terrible, one could say non existent. The chairs looked like they had been salvaged from a draught, moldy looking & all patched up. Well how was the food?... it was pretty average. I can get better quality from my local for far cheaper.Overall such a disappointing experience. Do yourself a favour, turn around & get out. Go somewhere else.

The food here is very authentic. Spicy and nice. The service here is also authentically mainland China.... Poor.
Hygiene is bad too....
4
The second time I go to this place. I like the cold cucumber dish, beancurd skin strips, salted egg soup, French beans with black beans
5
I love this place but honestly haven't tried many dishes because the first time I went there I fell in love with their Pork Ribs with Cumin and spices, you MUST try it!
I always finish my plate and i would not share with anyone!
5
We happened across this restaurant late at night. It was friendly and a relaxed atmosphere. The food was delicious and great value costing just $65 (about £33) for two of us - There was a real kick to the sambal prawns!
4
This was a Chinese restaurant on the walking street of Pagoda street. My friends and I ordered Streamed Seabass with Chinese wine and Soy source, stirred fried Beef fillets with Ginger and Garlic. All were tasty, however; we had to wait for quite sometime for Streamed Seabass with Chinese wine and Soy source. Other came quite fast. The place decoration was in modern Chinese style and fully air conditioners
5
I've been to the Old Chendu several times and it's a real pleasure. The fish is steamed and it tingles and the greens in various shapes are fresh and exquisite. Wandering through the menu is a pleasure and you make already a note of what to choose next time

We came here as a couple during the craziness on the eve of CNY. Credit to them they actually gave us a table when many others would not seat 2. Our only option was to order the banquet for 2. Dishes that came out first were lukewarm, it was obvious they had been prepared some time ago. One waiter told us we had dumplings and fish to go (they scratch off the list as they go). The dumplings were great. Then another waiter tried to tell us our menu was finished, but we held her to the fish. When it finally came out, it was still raw, it was obvious it needed at least 5 more minutes in the steamer. We did point this out but by then we were over it and just paid and left. This restaurant might be worth going to again, just not at this time of year and what we ate was disappointing at $135 for 2 of us (and we only drank water
5
Ate here for dinner, and wanted to keep eating and eating. everything was freshly prepared and very tasty. Went here with a local, it was my recommendation after reading reviews on TripAdvisor, so i think there is a new local convert. The restaurant was getting crowded when we came in and by the time we left there was a line to get in. I would definitely come here again when in Singapor
5
I was lucky enough to be on business in Singapore six times this past year, and it's a ritual have a spicy Szechuan at Old Chendu. It is indeed hard to choose from so many restaurants to choose from in Chinatown. This place came from a local tip and I was not disappointed! Try the Szechuan chicken or beef, the fried rices are very tasty and don't forget an ice cold oversized Tiger beer <burp

I am very partial to Sichuan food, and i have sampled many places.For a long time Old Chengdu was my favorite Sichuan restaurant in Singapore, and i have brought many friends there, coming on a monthly basis.for travelling reasons, the last time i visited Old Chengdu was more than 6 months ago. and then I returned last Friday.it was not the same food, and i feel so sad. semi sweet and tame Gong Bao Ji Ding with hardly any chili in it, the dish of chili (Hu Pi) was undercooked, so we did not have the juicy and melting spicy green chili but half crunchy and not well flavored vegetable, last our Gan Jia tofu also did not have any life. the cow stomach was still OK, although a bit low on the spice.I found that service is also on the decline indeed as noted in some reviews.A far cry from the launching restaurant whose vast majority of guests were PRC travelers.Maybe an accident. Not sure i will try again to check this though. it is the 3rd Sichuan restaurant that dies on me in Singapore. the 2 previous ones because the chef changed. i fear it is the same at Old Chengdu

As soon as you entering in mind your right foot, mine has got into oil spot on the floor.
Rice wine from the menu is actually kind of moonlight 56% strong.
Dumpling sous tastes like plane vinegar.
The service was almost absent.
Missing you, guys.
5
I love Sichuan food, and Old Chengdu lived up to its reputation. Loved the cumin mutton and the frog in chili oil. Both are must tries! The service is great, and the food is a delight to anyone who loves a hot & spicy meal!
4
This is our second visit. I like the spicy fishï¼ˆFei Teng Yu) very much. The spiciness is just right so we can still taste the fish. The portion is quite big for 2 people. The deep fried buns (mantou) are also very good. The dishes are quite authentic. Good place for try Szechuan cuisine
4
Not a new food joint as it has been around for a no of years. It serves authentic and good Sichuan cuisine at affordable prices. Restaurant can also cater to big groups and staff are friendly. I like the cold cucumber dish, beancurd skin strips, salted egg soup, French beans with black beans & Chilli dried prawns and the spicy marinated chicken best. There are lots and lots to choose and if you cannot stomach the chilli hot and spicy food, you can request for a reduction of these. There are also non- spicy hot dishes to select. Of course, the Mala dishes are what you go for as it give you the kick when your tongue savoury the hot and spicy taste. We tried this place many times and are still going back

Although the quality of the food remains excellent the service has gone from Bad to absolutely not acceptable. I visited the restaurant with the family as it was the wife's birthday. We love the food there and from past experiences were already tolerant of the bad / medicore service levels. This time round it reached intolerable levels with food being delayed and basic services like cutlery and napkins not being provided on repeat occasions. All this came with an added bad attitude from the waiters who simply kept ignoring us even though the restaurant was not packed
3
We had to wait 10 minutes just to get in, another 10 minutes untill the waitress cleaned up the table, another 10 minutes until she showed up to take our order... nevertheless the food was excellent. I really liked it. Unfortunatellt it was also quite expensive. We got charged around 40 SGD / person and we haven't even ordered any alcohol. Another downside were the toilets. You might call it "authentic chinese toilet" or from a western perspective "disgusting"! The floor, walls and toilet seat were covered with urin!
5
We really enjoyed the food! It has air conditioning and the service is good. It was a bit expensive compared to the food street places, but well worth it. We has the noodles (veggie style with no chili), eggs and tomato and fried beef rice :) dishes have generous portion
5
Tried quite a few Chinese restaurants in Chinatown and I must say, this one is head and shoulders above all the others. It is quite expensive but that's only because the portions are enormous, with each plate easily shared between two people. We really enjoyed the cumin ribs, fried green beans and a chili chicken dish. Looking forward to going back already and trying other things
5
This is really authentic, spicy, and excellent Sichuan cuisine. It's right in Chinatown on Pagoda Street in the thick of things. They have two floors, ground and one flight up. We ate there twice a few days apart, once upstairs (which is a little nicer) and once downstairs. The first time we had asian eggplant, string beans, and dry-stir-fried tofu, all excellent, and more than the 2 of us could eat. The second time we had pan fried dumplings, ma po dofu, and braised boy choy. They seem very busy, and the waitstaff was running around a lot -- we waited a little while the first time but were served quickly the second time
5
My wife and I wandered through Chinatown and saw Old Chendu. It was not that easy to find again when we wanted to eat - our fault not theirs. We dined on a spicy half chicken and a plate of stir fried tofu - equally as spicy. The food was great and the service friendly and quick. We also enjoyed a bottle of Tsing Tao which went perfectly with the meal. We will be looking for it next time we visit Singapore
5
If you can take hot food...do not miss the boiled beef in hot oil. It is "to die for". Be reminded...you may not feel your tongue for an hour after your meal. Any trip to Singapore is not complete without a meal here!
4
I would give it a 5, but my wife who is from China said that she marks it as 4.
Service is fast and friendly, the food is excellent (or 'good' according to my wife). I recommend to try it if you are around.
5
This is the one of my favorite places of great taste for regular visit. I can't find a word how to express the tasfulness of the dishes here. And affordable price and authentic Sezhuan foods. But not so spicy as looks. Try to have meal before 6 pm because there's always crowded after 6 pm. Verities of choices on beef and pork mainly. Veggies are good too. I can't pick which are the best dishes because I fall in love with most of the dishes out there. Must try at least.
5
We went back to this place again last weekend for friends gathering. The 3rd was renovated and now has much better suite for large group. The taste is still as good as old time. Very authentic Sichuan dishes. If you like spicy dishes, you have to try it when you visit Singapore (unless you will continue your journey from here to Sichuan

We visited here for lunch in July 2015. I have visited here a couple years back, and remember how spicy the food at this Sichuan restaurant is. It is located right inside the sheltered "Pagoda Street" area, allowing convenient access by Chinatown MRT. Our order consisted of a spicy "cow part" salad ("small" spice), fish soup ("small" spice), a mild cucumber and garlic salad, and shredded steamed potato (not spicy), with rice on the side. The portions are a little on the large side, but two people should be able to finish the "small" portion on the soups. The "cow part" salad was my favorite, since the spice was more tolerable due to it being served cold, giving way to the nice texture of the thinly sliced cow parts and the fresh cilantro garnish. The cucumber and potato were both fine, mainly just serving as palate cleansers for cooling down the spicy taste in the mouth. The fish soup's spice was a bit on the intense side, despite it being "small-level" spice. Aside from that, the fish pieces were very tender, flaking very easily in the rice bowl without seeming "mushy". Overall, however, the spice of all the dishes seemed to get to the point that it was just masking the subtle flavors and tastes of the dish, especially in the fish soup. Ideally, those who are not very spice-tolerant (like me) should take advantage of their spice rating when ordering (roughly translated from Chinese): "very mild", "mild", "small spice", "moderate spice", "full spice", noting that "small spice" (which we ordered) is actually quite spicy. But of course, each person is different. The service was average: not much worth noting. Overall, if you can tolerate high levels of spice (common in all Sichuan food), hence the title, you will definitely appreciate the food they offer here

I have been coming to Old Chengdu since I came to Singapore. Food is great. Service is ok once they take your order. Don't sit upstairs. Waitresses and bus girls are loud, shouting and banging dishes as they collect them. Very impolite and improper behavior while patrons still trying to enjoy their dinner. Didn't have this ad experience downstairs. It's better.
4
This heaven is located in the heart of Chinatown, yet so easy to find because the crowd lead us here. We ordered Mapo Tofu, Garlic Spinach, & Pork. They all taste amazing! But the portion was too big for the two of us and the server/waiter was not that communicative. Overall, the place is very convenient, the food taste was amazing, but I wish the server will be more communicative so we can choose a smaller portion :) We'll comeback for sure!

The experienced tourist might be wary of approaching a Chinese restaurant in the most crowded section of China Town. So this traditional place comes as a very pleasant surprise with hundreds of very tasty dishes in very generous quantities, even for dishes designated as 'small'. The Kung Pao --chicken or prawns- are delectable. Great variety of fish, vegetables, pork, beef and frog should please any palate. But, beware of the little pepper warnings: spicy means really, really hot. Request according to your tolerance. Excellent service, reasonable prices and a very convenient location
5
I had only experienced Szechuan food in NYC, and love it, so I was excited when I saw this place and figured it might be more authentic and better quality than NYC. It was fantastic, spicy, mouth-numbing, thrilling - go here. The Ma Po Tofu was richly flavored and the tofu was meltingly soft. More important though, was the Kou Shui Ji - a cold poached and sliced chicken breast, in a pool of rich, complex, spicy sauce. The name translates to "saliva chicken," or perhaps more compellingly, "mouthwatering chicken." The sauce was revelatory; deep, layered, spicy, bright. I nearly drank all that was left. In a 5 day food-binge, this stands out as the single best dish I had in Singapore

If spicy but flavorful Sichuan Food is your craving this restaurant is a great bet. It's located almost next to the pagoda street exit on the Chinatown exit of the MRT - you will have to peel your eyes for it as it's quite unpretentious but once you get in you can see its more like a traditional tea house in chengdu. The decor could be better but you come here for the food. The service is good, smiling and brisk - if you can smarter a little Chinese it helps a lot. The menu is in English and had a huge variety of choices - the drinks are also a good selection and reasonable but no chengdu style tea theatrics ! The food is surely the highlight - we ordered the usual favorites and the fish in Chili oil, the Kung pao chicken as well as the double cooked pork all hit the mark. As I do multiple trips to China a year and having been to Sichuan many times , I can say the food is a little watered down for foreign taste but it's still fresh and authentic -if you really crave Ma la spice numbing yours lips ask for extra spicy when ordering ! The prices are quite reasonable for Singapore and the location. All in all this is our Sichuan fix when we need it now

A fan of spicy Sichuan. They were out of a couple of dishes but what came was pretty good (eggplant, diced chicken, spicy noodles). Slightly pricey though.
5
Best meal for less than $20 including beverage. I had pork in a hot and sweet sauce with rice on the side and a lemon juice. Fast service tasty food.
4
Lovely food at good prices.
99% local Chinese diners, always a good sign.
A noisy and busy inside restaurant, very authentic in every way.
Loved it.
4
Excellent ribs and outstanding crab, both oozing super-fresh spices and marinades.
Little bit pricey, but all the dishes we had were really good quality.
5
First visited this restaurant in 2009 and have been looking forward to going back ever since. Our meal last night was equally good, which was great to see. Great quality food, portion sizes and value for money (large Harbin beer only $7). Highly, highly recommended!!
5
Having eating Sichuan food in China many times, I can honestly say that the food at Old Chengdu is as close to the real thing as you can get in Singapore. Unabashedly spicy and with more than generous helpings. Try the chicken with chilli, fish slices in chilli oil, dumplings and any of the green veggies. Everything tastes delicious. And don't forget to keep some chilled beer on hand so you can un-numb your mouth by the end of the meal
4
We were recommended this place by our mainland Chinese friends, who totally swear by it. It's a small, bustling little restaurant, but the food they dish out is amazing and authentic. We had never before eaten some of the dishes we ate here. You can see many Chinese diners here, both from Singapore as well as China.A must try if you want the heat on your tongue from Sichuan
5
It is steps outside the train station on right side. The sign is small and no one speaks English (which is rare in Singapore) but the food and service were amazing! We tried the Kung pao prawns and they were amazing, probably the best We've had ever tasted. The chili crab was off the chain;) not many tourists I there but after reading the reviews I knew that we had to try it. I highly recommend for an authentic Singapore meal with excellent everything, you will not want to to miss this place
5
When we are in Chinatown, or we want those dumplings, this is the place we go. We have never been disappointed. We particularly love the dumplings, and the pork ribs. The veggies are always fresh and tasty as well. We usually mix in a new dish each time, to make sure we try different things. You can order small plates, so you can try more dishes. Service is fast and friendly. What is even more amazing, is that it is at the MRT entrance on Pagoda St - when you get off the escalator, turn north and there it is! It couldn't be more convenient
4
The three of us took a table on the first floor. We order 3 dishes (fish slices in chilli oil, spinach with century eggs, and lotus roots on a hot plate), rice and fruit juices. Food is genuine and authentic. The portions were generous. The restaurant, at 5 pm on Sunday, was filled by mainland Chinese working in Singapore and visitors - a assurance that the quality has met their approval
