Not much variety of food. The seafoods were not fresh as they’re dry and smell unpleasant. The cleaning up of plates and replanishment of food were quite slow.
5
Nice ambience and quiet environment. Suitable for business discussions and couples too! Recommend.
Would be good if can add on more varieties of food.

Booked buffet lunch via HungryGoWhere website to enjoy the 1-for-1 buffet lunch. Very limited selection of food. Dessert was also limited. Overall the taste and quality of food were at best average. Even with the 1-for-1 promotion, it was not worth the price of $62++
3
This was my second visit and during CNY , for dinner.On comparison, this time round the food choice was quite limited and quality was not as good.Seafood on ice was fresh but the cooked food was not of high standard.There were also limited dessert choice though the durian penget was nice but served in small glasses.On the whole, a very average buffet.....especially so when the yusheng was not among the buffet spread, even though it was supposed to be CNY theme
4
Every table started with a cold combination of seafood as shown on pic. For those that love to eat this as cold dish will like it as they were fresh. However, not much meat in the crab and the mini lobster.What I like in this buffet is the sashimi and oyster that were fresh. And their duck and pork knuckle were crispy and delicious. And because is a CNY Festive buffet, they added a special dish which the Chinese called "Peng Cai" that with the mix of abalone, mushroom, etc. Of course, if you're not fast enough, you won't see the expensive stuff. They also have steamed "nian gao".Variety was not alot and the food taste was satisfactory. But their service was good. They served you beverages when you requested from them.You may give it a try for the service and atmosphere. Or stay in the hotel with lounge access package; which you will like it.

Reserved under CHOPE app, one for one promo.We were given one bowl of cold seafood, and it was tasteless. but on the whole, the service and the buffet spread were good.this is my 2nd visit, and i do remember my 1st was good too.would go again, esp if there is promo.
5
We decided on dining at Escape restaurant since it is fairly new to us and went ahead to give it a try. There's 10 of us and they were really swift with their service. The buffet variation was quite extensive and well covered. As the crowd starts creeping in, we observe how efficient and meticulous they were to their customers. THUMBS UP
4
One thing to call out is their service staffs are all warm & nice. Food wise mostly local food & taste quite alright. Cold seafood session not impressive, with very small crab & clam, not even oysters or crayfish. What disappoint us are that it’s stated as Chinese New Year theme buffet but there are nothing CNY about the buffet other than the few CNY cookies. Luckily it’s on 1 for 1 deal if not it’ll be an overpriced buffet asking for $62++ per pax.
5
Been here for the second time and absolutely loved both the service as well as food spread. It's a rather compact buffet place but the selections , both local and international flavours were brilliant . And it's open 24 hours mean our group of friends continued with drinking after the dinner line closes at 10. Highly reccomends the place for group gatherings .
1
Decided to order a reuben sandwich from the a la carte menu. The order took so long to arrive and the sandwich was disappointing. It was 2 thinly sliced pieces of salami, miserable sauerkraut on lousy rye bread. Please improve it or take it off the menu!!! Terrible
4
it was good to have a lunch gathering with friends. the food were ok, not that special, the service was fine, and they kindly allowed us to stay longer as we didnt meet for long time and had a lot to say. haha.. thank you.
5
quality of food is fresh and good. friendly staff arrange for a complimentary birthday cake on the spot when they realised that we r celebrating mum's birthday. overall our family (17pax) has a great time.
4
This is our repeated visit. Went with a group of 12 pax. Nothing short of a very good service and freshness in foods. Consistently good, and excellent service in general. Good value with 1-1 dining.
5
Be careful of waste food on floors, as my friend fell and hurt her hand and arm. But, the restaurant manager was responsible and attend the incident professionally.
5
Variety of food may not be a lot, but services from staff were great! Very attentive and friendly... I also love their durian pengat!
5
Went there on a weekday night, service was very good and seafood was all fresh. Not too much variety compare to other hotel buffet but food quality is good.
5
I visited the restaurant for its buffet as recommended by a friend. The spread was excellent and the oysters were so fresh that they were snapped up once the station was topped up. My wife and I had an enjoyable time in the cosy environment, and the staff were keen and enthusiastic in making sure we were comfortable. The complimentary durian fried rice with belacan was unique and pleasantly delicious. All in all, even with my 3 year old girl in tow, the restaurant made it a memorable dinner for all of us. Highly recommended
4
We decided to have ala carte and not the buffett as there was too much to eat. We ordered the Hokkein mee which was very good and tasty,we also ordered the Beef Hor Fun which was very good too, the beef was tender and juicy. The only dish that was not good was the vegetarian bee hoon which was sweet and does not taste good
1
Lunch was on 14 Jan. 6 adults were cramped into a table for 4 despite reservation made. No staff setup the tables and plates have to be cleared by ourselves. Manager and Assistant Manager were busy serving 1 table of VIP, serving food and chit chatting non stop to them and no attention was made to other tables. Service staff at chicken rice was terrible
2
Service- or the lack thereof. They set up a table for 5 for my reservation but only placed 4 set of cutleries. When i approached a staff he told me to approach his colleague instead of try to help. When my sis approached the same staff to help us take a photo, he also said “Give me 2 mins to finish my stuff first” instead of getting his colleague to help us. However i am grateful for them to come sing a birthday song for my mum. The chef at the sushi counter also told me to wait as he is busy. I requested for salmon sashimi and tako. But he only prepared salmon after like 10mins when i went back. The staffs there seems to like to ask customers to wait. FOOD - not worth the price even tho there’s a 1-for-1 promo. There was a chilled seafood platter as well as durian fried rice which they served towards the end of our session. By then we were already like proceeding for dessert and also the seafood platter on ice was bland and tasteless. I only like the indian food corner and the crayfish in chilli crab style sauce and Durian Pengat
5
Amazing selection of food for the festive buffet! I enjoyed the lobsters the most. The free buttered lobster really made the meal special - great touch of service. Party hats and cremebouche made it all picture-perfect!
4
The food is cooked to suit my liking but the service is a little bit slow. Restaurant was empty, but I had to wait for almost everything from order to food delivery and making the payment at cashier.
4
Escape Restaurant & Lounge was located right beside farrer park mrt station. No matter which exit you take, it is just there. Very convenient to get there. Waiters and waitress was very friendly and courteous. Good service1
4
Good value and less crowded in Christmas Day.nice presentation in setting, will going back for New Year day.
4
It was over my expectations to have Xmas lunch there. They even prepared some small gifts and food variety was good too.
4
Restaurant has a good set up to create the festive mood. A good range of festive food too. Santa claus included
3
The festive price hike was not reflected in the food. There was no turkey or roast for christmas week dining. Food spread was local. Only christmas dessert was the stollen. Disappointing otherwise nice place with good service. I suppose in ordinary times at ordinary pricing, I would be rating the place differently
5
This is my 2nd visit to the hotel and my first Christmas lunch experience with the hotel. Lunch was a festive classic sumptuous international spread. Staff were thoughtful, and served with their excellence. Customer service was good even during the busy festive lunch time. Santa and the complimentary lobsters were surprises as they were not expected, making our lunch experience an unforgettable one and a definite comeback in the future. House wine was very good, too

We have dined at Escape several times as it's very convenient for us. It's open 24 hours, very clean, relaxed environment and spacious, and staff are always friendly and attentive. Thought it was about time we wrote a review. For a la Carte, we usually have the burger which is always satisfying, roast chicken (S$24++) which is a good half chicken portion, sometimes a little too salty but usually fine. Or their Bak Kut Teh (S$18++) - but was disappointed when my recent portion of ribs were very small. We did mention this, and they said they usually serve 5 pieces, but these pieces were super tiny and mainly bone - so that was disappointing. The set does come with 2 x chicken wings though. It's not the cheapest, but what do you expect of a comfortable restaurant attached to a 5 star hotel? We recently had the Festive buffet dinner with a 1 for 1 promotion which was extremely good value at $75++. Includes free-flow fizzy soft drinks and coffee and TWG tea. Everything was well presented, they had a lovely roast turkey and delicious roasted lamb, cooked to perfection. Served with chestnuts and roasted veggies, like asparagus and tomatoes on the vine. They also had local faves like chicken rice, and roasted belly pork, decent selection of curries, naan and coconut rice. Seafood on ice, but no lobster. They did have slipper lobster though which is good enough for me. They also prepare an individual bowl of seafood on ice for your table which was nicely presented. They also had a good selection of desserts, including a delicious chocolate log cake. They also gifted a cute little box of party items, like party whistles and eye mask etc. We're pretty happy with Escape and have already made another reservation for the festive buffet for New Years Day :) Hopefully it will be just as good
3
We ate here with a 2 for 1 buffet promotion. Otherwise I would have felt quite bad for paying full price! The buffet is exactly worth half price. For full price you have sumptuous buffets all over town. Food and selection average. Service not great with items not being replenished. One time onl
5
We come here for lunch. I didn't expect their buffet was stunning. The restaurant was crowded enough but not lessen the good vibe. Foods were ridiculously taste fantastic with more than enough selections.
3
Choice of food average, quality of food average too. customer service average as they do not have enough waiters and waitress. Only Dessert is good and with some creative dessert!
3
The hot food selection is limited. The cold food is adequate, could have been better. The dessert selection is wide range and is ok.
3
Food was decent. Had a good spread of Indian, Chinese, western and Japanese fare but I felt that the price was a quite steep.
5
This is my second time here and the food is still as good although this time around, it is a little bit more crowded with more people coming to celebrate the festivities. Kudos to staff who are busy and yet are super attentive and are always ready to serve 
3
We used to like the Teochew porridge buffet for supper, and had been there many times.Sad to find out on Sunday that the standard of food had dropped, which both my husband and I didn't feel like going back again in the near future. Maybe one day long enough for us to crave the food, would try again. Hopefully by then they would pick up and resume the good quality of food
4
Return visits with Friends.Dine last Saturday. Knowing that it was serving with Christmas Theme. Nice Christmas Main (turkey, ham and sausageChristmas dessert like log cakes, gingerbread man ( DIY to decorate it), mini cakes with Santa on it and candy canes too.Normal/same spread of the hot and cold dishes section.Order our fav drinks like TWG, latte, cappuccino, soft drinks (all inclusive). Have a good dinner and chat with friends.Book with CHOPE - 1 for 1

We met up with an ex-colleague for dinner here. It was close to 7pm, only 50% full. The Restaurant’s credentials are good and settings definitely classy.. Meals comes with both a-la-carte and buffet options, Escape’s extensive menu boasts a comprehensive range of local delights as well as Western favourites of pasta, pizza, grilled meats and fresh seafood . Worth mentioning is the open kitchen concept where we can see the chef preparing food! Refreshing indeed when you can watch the chefs preparing the dishes right behind the kitchen counters.We have a look at the buffet, rather interesting but spread was not a wide selection, at least compared to my last few buffet meals. So decided to order from a-la-carte as we were not that hungry. I ordered the dark-sauced KL “Tai Lok Mee” (made popular in Kuala Lumpur), and not easy to find good-ones over at Singapore. My colleagues ordered the chicken rice, One Signature Lobster Laksa and also beef-horfun. We also ordered a Hawaiian Spicy Spam pizza to share.The food arrived a little late, more than 20 mins when we did not see a large crowd. The quantity is sufficient and importantly they all came with good ‘woh hei”, . speaks of proficient wok-frying skills. Quite a pleasant surprise the chef can dish out the specialities well. The authentic KL Noodles include good quality dark sauce, crispy pork lard, The chicken is tender and the accompanying sauce interesting. But the beef slices (black angus beef?) not enough and not quite taste as well as we have expected. The laksa apparently does not disappoint, according to our colleague. :>The pizza is too thin and the toppings not generous though. I also tried out their signature Durian Penga – indeed good!. Just 1 glass and it was instant-gratification.. haha. While continuing our conversation we ordered some drinks. The latte was good, not spectacular. Overall we felt that the price was quite steep for the meal we had. Save by the good service of staff, we may not visit unless they come with certain promotions... Still the place is excellent if you want to have a quiet undisturbed buffet. Just be prepared to pay a little premium for its great ambienc
5
I LOVED the Mee Siam, which was cooked a la minute. It has the small shrimps that I missed so much. We could get them in the old days, but now, it is virtually non-existent.I also LOVED the Durian Pengat, which is one of the main reasons why I go back there as soon as I am able to. I WILL DEFINITELY GO AGAIN
5
I visit the Escape Restaurant with my friends to celebrate her birthday. My friends and I really enjoyed the small gesture that the restaurant prepared for us and even sang a birthday song for our table. Although the buffet spread was not a wide selection, my friend truly enjoyed herself and that was all that mattered to me, Thank you for the wonderful memories
4
Chose this buffet because of the durian dessert. Variety is reasonable. Seafood is fresh. Cook station pasta is average. Cook station Mee siam not to my liking but the previous Mee rebus was gd.
3
The seafood wasn't as fresh as what I had previously. There was also a housefly going around the place. The durian fried rice did not go well as sweet and savoury just doesn't blend.
5
It is really value for money since we got 1for1 buffet dinner through Chope. The staff provided excellent and prompt service. Thumps up.
5
Me and my friends visited the place for the first time! We love the variety of food, the asian food live station, and also the very good service by the servers over there! Thanks for making us feel so good:)
5
Food are nice and very good service . The next day my family still n miss the food there . Will be going there the next time
4
The one time offer of the cold seafood platter and fried noodles should not be "compulsory". There are diners who may not appreciate such dishes or the size of the portions, so. Also, the restaurant should be more stringent regarding food wastage.
5
Well the spread not a lot but the quality of the food was super. Seafood were fresh. Cooked food were tasty. Not forgetting... the price was reasonable and service was beyond words!!
5
I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. The food was excellent and the ambience was okay (even with my daughter). The staff also went the extra mile to arrange for a surprise birthday cake for her. Special thanks to everyone for making the night so enjoyable.
5
Full service, meals and drinks even though is under Chope Promo 1 for 1. 40 pax dine on 23.09. We are caught by surprise that even for promo 1 for 1, the restaurant didn't cut short/off any food/drinks. Food: Yes, agreed with some reviews, the food range might not be wide but enough to cater for most people. It is the quality/taste and not the variety that counts. It manage to cater to my guest taste buds.. from the picky to the all liking types.(PS:My children is missing the food next day, especially the paste and laksa.. of course the drinks...).There is a one time off - Seafood platter and some noodle. It is kind gesture from the restaurant. I do have same feel on the food wastage but partially because the seafood platter taste 'normal - not too fantastic'. Drinks: Not just normal plain tea and coffee... It serve latte , cappuccino, TWG teas and soft drinks (THUMBS UP). It make a different to me..Service:Most of the waiter /waitress are kind and fast working. I believed that night the restaurant is full but the empty plates on my table are still being cleared timely. Ordered drinks also came fast and correct.Last 2 comments/Compliment:1- Comments - Reservation /Table arrangement.I wrote in email requesting ... seating together, child and baby chair request.Seating arrangement not too fantastic as some of guests are sited too far. On the spot, managed to change of group of 8 nearer to us. Child seat are not counted in and I need to add in a chair manually and get some guest to squeeze. The front stuff should be aware and made know off particularly when there is a big group coming. My 1st few guests have problem coming in as the staff need to go through the Chope reservation 1 by 1.. Total is 5. So the people Q behind, need to wait very long.1- Compliments:Thank you the outlet manager Mr Mohamad Hj Ummer for helping with us and making the whole party a success. So another special thanks to an indian waiter (sorry, I didn't get your name) for helping and making the last min seats changing.Thank you all, please keep up the good work
3
Excellent service that is marred by the poor selection of food. The selection of food is poor compared to several other hotel buffets out there. Good desserts as well. The service is really really good. The place is quiet if you want to have a quiet buffet
3
Nice ambient and friendly service staff but limited food selection especially the seafood on ice & station. Insufficient amount of seafood to serve through the buffet lunch hours. Late diners be ware!
5
The seafood platter is fantastic. The durian pengat is authentic. The fish masak hitam is so umphh. The staffs are effecient and courteous
4
Nice ambience and good service. Seafood is replenished quickly and there is plenty of asian food to choose from. Will be good if there is more cooked vegetables.
5
The foods is tasty and replenishment is fast. The only negative point is no salmon sashimi for lunch buffet.
3
We had breakfast in this restaurant as a part of the hotel package. The continental breakfast was widespread but Indian options are very limited
4
Decently-sized spread for a weekend lunch buffet, with greater focus on Asian dishes than Western. Some excellent mains and lovely desserts (especially for durian-lovers) with a good range of cheeses. A pity there was no live station for cooked seafood, which I had read about in past reviews.Very value-for-money with the '2nd diner for $0.60++' Chope promotion (i.e. 2 people for $50.60++)
3
First of all, I am shocked to see the chefs using their mobile phones with their plastic gloves on. After using their phones, they went on to handle food with that same pair of gloves!!! I have NEVER seen chefs at other restaurants using mobile phones because I think they are supposed to lock up their phones when they are working.The pumpkin soup is too sweet and milky. Pumpkin on its own is already sweet, so no need to add sugar and MSG.At the Japanese station, I am disappointed that there is no salmon sashimi. Buffets at all hotels have salmon sashimi together with some other types of seafood. The Chinese stir-fried dishes are good. However, the roast chicken, roast pork ribs, char siew are all too tough.The mutton rendang is too tough. The nonya chicken curry is not authentic. The fish in the fish curry is not fresh. The prawns in the laksa should have been shelled so that diners need not dirty their hands to remove the shells. The laksa gravy is not thick enough.The durian pengat is good. I saw diners grabbing multiple glasses at one go. The chocolate cake is rich but extremely sweet. I suggest that the sweetness be reduced by 75% in our fight against diabetes. Also the chocolate cake should be cut into smaller pieces like the other cakes. Diners who find the cake TOO SWEET may mot finish the cake, thus wasting the cake.Most hotels issue complimentary carpark tickets to diners, it will be good if Escape can do that too
4
Good deal for weekend dinner. It's my second visit but personally, I feel my first visit was better as the food were fresher. One thing that's worth the mention is their really yummy complimentary noodle (udon).Eat it while it's hot! I will still give them another try in future:
3
The oysters were not fresh. I felt sick at the end of the meal and threw up. The manager denied that the problem was with bad oysters. He claimed no one else complained. When I got home I had diarrhea as well. otherwise my family enjoyed the meal.. They did not eat the oysters
3
Got a good deal on Chope's 6th Anniversary whereby I brought my husband to try it out. Variety was average though there's an open kitchen concept. Each table will get 1 plate of free serving of seafood which includes baby lobster, crayfish, crab claw & clam . There's also another free serving of chilli crab udon.Overall, I find the food is average but pricing (original price) is slightly overpriced for the range and variety. With promo pricing I got, I think the price is still reasonable. However if you want to have group gatherings & celebrations, it's quite a nice place to go to
4
Dinner buffet here was great. I have dine here with my family. Sushi was great. I like "Durian Pudding" as my favorite dessert. Let's try it
4
Service was good and love the variety of food! Seafood are fresh and there are local delights like rojak, mee siam and teochew porridge. Will go back again!
4
Buffet Lunch:
International varied quality.
Value for money ..wide spread.
India spread good.
Japanese so so
Bread and cheese good.
Many choices for chinese food
Local desert spread good
Worth giving a try..
2
We were there for lunch buffet.
Service staff was prompt, polite and made us feel welcomed.
However, food selection was very disappointing. There wasn't much to choose from and quality was average at best. Not worth the buffet price.
4
Had buffet breakfast here and also dinner.Food was good,no complains.The dessert after dinner,the mango pomelo was really good comes with a scoop of ice cream,wish they have it in durian as well will be really nice.
4
Located just outside farrer park mrt exit c. The restaurant has an Open kitchen concept with interactive buffet set up.
3
First experience because was given some vouchers. Feel price they are charging is way over what they are offering. Oysters are available on a limited periodic serving and sashimi variety was few.
1
I recently went to Escape Restaurant at one farrer for lunch with my family. To my dissapointment, the buffet spread was really not worth the money!Furthermore, they only had 3 staff to clear plates, serve drinks etc.They were so slow that I nearly waited 10 minutes for my drinks to be refilled.There were plates piling up on our table but the staff choose not to see or clear. After constantly telling the waiters to clear the plates, they cleared bit by bit. The staff looked very unfriendly and only smiled when we were leaving.I will never go to Escape Restaurant again
5
A pretty wide array of mains and desserts are available. Their ala minute section was Prawn noodle, which was quite nice except that the soup was a bit bland. I was pleasantly surprised that the coffee (e.g. cappuccino, latte, flat white) is actually handcrafted & served by the waiters/waitresses! Chamomile, Earl Grey, English Breakfast & Moroccan Mint tea are available as well
3
We went there for the dinner buffet on a weekend. The restaurant was almost close to fullhouse. The buffet spread is not alot compared to other hotels of similar star ratings. The topup of food was extremely slow considering the number of people taking the food and everyone needs to queue up to wait for the topup. The grill section needs to be improved especially, the grilling only started almost 1 hour into dinner service and the grilling process took so long. By the time the food is grilled, we are full eating the rest of the food already. The food that were outstanding though, is the herbal prawns, drunken chicken, black pepper crayfish and the durian dessert! We will not be back again. As the title goes, once is enough!
4
Good. Food is nice service is good. Staff are attending to our request. Dessert is best for me. Durian dessert is, fantastic
4
Bought it during offer and worth the price. Without offer, will consider it a bit expensive. Disappointed that there was no salmon sashimi.

The Meatilicious Buffet was advertised to have a great variety of good cuts of meat, the online advertising and the posters at the front of the restaurant for the Meatilicious buffet indicated both lunch and dinner timings, so I booked to go for lunch with a table of 8, all meat lovers.When we arrived, I saw i pathetic looking roast beef that looked overdone and literally NO OTHER red meat that looked anything like that poster. Sure there was some chicken curry in the Indian selection and some tough stew and some Char siew and Siew Yoke, that was not as good as a normal hawker stall ( who goes to a buffet to eat that when you could get the same in your neighbour hawker stall for much less?) but it was certainly NOT "Meatilicious".The selection included cooked to order pasta, noodles and cantonese roast, a small but really yummy selection of Indian dishes, some seafood on ice - mainly prawns, mussels and clams (no oysters or other good stuff)There was some sashimi ( not very fresh) and sushi.Dessert selection was average and the main highlight was durian pengat.The staff was average.When I spoke to the manager about the lack of meat, he said it was only for dinner - when I pointed out that the poster he was standing next to did not specify dinner only, he agreed but said that's how it is. NO apologies.Very disappointed as it was not what I booked for, despite some good dishes
5
Visited this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day with my family members. They have an on going promotion with Hungry Go Where and was given 50 percent discount. The spread of the buffet was very good. Each table is given a seafood platter consisting crabs, crayfish, mussels. They also serve fresh oysters, prawns and a variety of fresh Japanese sashimi and tuna. Live stations serves , spaghetti, roast meat, laksa. The service provided by the waiters and waitresses are excellent. Definitely we will come back for future dinners
5
Very good experience dining at Escape Restaurant multiple times, and I have to write this review to particularly give commendation to Mr Anandaraj Dharmapola. He is a very responsible and professional Asst. Manager that provided heartwarming and sincere service for my family & I.I actually revisited this restaurant because of his welcoming gesture and attentive customer ethics as a service provider. I believe he played a vital part to lead his team in providing tip-top service to the restaurant go-ers. Food is a 7.5/10, but service is 10/10. Have no complaints for such reasonable pricing and variety actually. Overall, it is definitely worth dropping by for a next visit again.Would like to thank Mr Anand for providing such attentive care towards the needs of my family & I during our meal. Please keep up that ignited passion you have there 
4
This was our 2nd time here. Service was superb. What impressed me was even the head chef was very friendly, unlike others whom we met at other top hotels. Food was very fresh. Had crabs, oysters, sashimi, laksa and even Indian food. All 9 family members ranging from 2 to 65 enjoyed the food. Will definately be back
4
We had always wanted to try the Escape Restaurant located at One Farrer Hotel & Spa and we did so last Saturday!We were early for the dinner buffet and the waitstaff introduced us to the 5-8pm happy-hour drinks menu that cost $10 each for the typical house pours, house wines and cocktails. Good deal but we didn't order.When the buffet line opened, we were welcomed by the decent food spread. There was fresh seafood from Sashimi to Sushi, cold prawns to clams and raw oysters. The spaghetti are cooked to your order and they are done well! There's also the roasted items - Cantonese style and western roast beer. The other cooked food were a nice spread and not too much - there was even a Chilli crab dish! The restaurant complimented each table with a fresh seafood basket filled with shellfish, king crab, scallops and yabbies. They also served a lightly durian-scented seafood fried rice, which we think it was very ingenious and well-done. However, we couldn't detect what dish amongst the buffet spread was the key highlight that's worth talking about.On the whole, Escape restaurant's food and services are reasonable. Wouldn't mind going there again in a few month's time if they would seasonally change their buffet offerings once in a while

I'm utterly upset by a Korean cashier staff who is not credible in her words. I dine in for buffet dinner with my family of four having been informed by her at the main entrance that we could enjoy 20% off our bill regardless mode of payment but I end up incurring the full bill instead; reason being that the discount only applies to Amex. Apparently, I have an Amex Platinum Taka card and yet she said that card is not eligible for any promo. Why confuse customers like this then place us in such awkward manner upon payment? Reckon I'll think twice when dining there again
1
I made a reservation via Eatigo for their porridge buffet. In the end, i was told that the Eatigo discount does not apply for the porridge buffet as it is already a discount price. However, this is not stated on the Eatigo site at all. There is also an ongoing Maybank 4 pay 3 promo. However, the restaurant refused to honor the discount. Later i wrote in to to lodge a complaint and after several correspondences, all the restaurant manager said was that its a miscommunication with Eatigo and they fixed the problem already. They refused to take responsibility for the fact that their miscommunication resulted in our having to pay an extra 30% due to the withdrawal discount. Very poor service and lack of respect to their customers ... As for the food, it is is generally tasty except for 1 issue. For a supper buffet with 10+ items, they actually removed 2 items which was indicated in their promo mats, stating menu rotation??? Errr, this is a small spread of only 10+ items, what menu rotation are they talking about? For such a small spread and not to mention the item is mentioned in the promo mats, the items should be available, instead of shortchanging the diners with an excuse like menu rotation. Overall a very disappointing visit. Not recommended.

~my family had dinner last July 2016, my kids who prefer ramen and beef had a taste of ESCAPE and were wowed by the ala carte menuOmaha Tenderloin - Super YUMzWanton Noodle Soup - okConey Island Dog - YUMzOne Farrer Laksa - okwill return :

Conveniently located above Farrer Park MRT, Escape offers a decent lunch buffet spread with good local selections - especially enjoyed the roast meats - good dessert spread. Service was excellent - friendly and prompt.
5
the taste is very good, service also satisfied with what i need, and the location close to MRT station good access
4
Love the breakfast spread especially the bread section. Not only those, the service experience is great!. Staff are helpful, prompt and friendly.
3
We are a family of 6 adults on a Sunday lunch out, using some discount vouchers purchased off chope.com. Comfy ambiance, seating and great service (tables were cleared in a very timely manner, prompt in delivering coffee ordered). Spread is rather limited (sashimi - only tuna; fresh seafood - prawn, clam, mussel), although it was a fair variety of stations (salad, local, indian, western, bread+cheese, desserts) of decent quality. Overall a good experience, although we probably won't visit again unless with further discounts/promotions available
2
We went for weekday dinner. The mango mousse cake is the worst taste that I've ever tried. Ondeh is hard. Mother's Day cocktail tasted awful. Pig trotter vinegar without old ginger had a strong smelly pork smell. Ingredients are too less for big-sized popiah skin. Suggested for smaller size popiah skin or serve kueh pie tee will do. Crayfish chili gravy not so tasty. Poor quality for sushi. No refill for chicken satay. It is really a waste to have such good dining environment & good staff service but with low standard of food. Hope the restaurant manager will sample the food before serving to customers

I was so disappointed with this place. While they give you a visual/video menu to help you choose they have no sense of taste. I got sat near the kitchen and it was loud loud banging. The beef with flat noodles was a mess. The noodles stuck together and the oyster sauce basic and flavorless. the beef inside was good but would not go back. I don't usually give 2 stars but this was a bad experience all around.

13 of us visited the restaurant to have lunch on a Sunday. The booking was fine, no issue. However, the spread of food was not to some of our expectations. For seafood, there were some crawfish, prawns, mussels and other shells. For Japanese, there were some sushi but no sashimi which was a big let down for some. There were some indian dishes like chicken curry, mutton curry, vegetarian curry, naan, prata and such but I was hoping for at least a tandoori dish. For Live stations, choices include Mee Siam, Pasta Station and hainanese chicken and roast pork. I skipped the bread and cheese station as there was nothing to shout about. The dessert was better, maybe because it had my favourite Durian Pengat.They have soft serve in chocolate and vanilla flavour - kids and adults love this. Chocolate fondue station is popular with the kids too. It's also worthwhile to note that the restaurant offers coke, sprite, fanta orange, coffee or tea with the buffet lunch
3
Most of hot dishes were already cold when we walked in. Given 45 minutes to go till close, this is totally unacceptable.Food quality is also mediocre for the price of S$30++. Even though Singapore is a very expensive place, I expected better quality. The service is acceptable but is quite noisy.Not coming back again for sure.
5
Great ambience with quality food. Must commend that the waiter was very nice too, he informed me that Escape is wifi-enabled and issued me with the wifi password and connect for me my iphone. Constantly come check if we needed more drinks and clear the used plates fast too.

Had buffet here with my siblings. Selection was fair. They serve a seafood platter on the table and a chili crab noodle. Something unique for a buffet restaurant to do. Dessert station was nice cos they have the softserve machine. I love the frozen yoghurt and the durian dessert. Servers were quick to clear the table too. One thing nice is the buffet comes with softdrinks. coffee and tea
3
Food quality was a disappointment, sashimi was cut too small. Clayfish and roast beef not fresh, oysters very small.
5
The breakfast spread was lavish, exotic and supremely tasty to say the least.
The hotel staff was well behaved, very helpful and prompt to service us.
5
The seafood was especially fresh and good. Love the durian puree dessert which I think could be the prized Mao Shang Wang grade. A perfect meal that I rounded up with a cup of TWG tea. The staff were attentive and I enjoyed the service.
4
Did not expect much but we were surprised by the quality and taste of the local food such as oyster omelette and kL black noodle . the service staff were friendly and helpful .
4
Good value. Lots of seafood to choose. Dessert choices was good too. There was variety. Quality not that great but very good value
5
This was my second time here for the dinner buffet. Great ambience, impeccable service and a good variety of local and international dishes. For the price we paid, it was good value for money too!
5
We had buffet lunch at Escape (One Farrer Hotel) to celebrate my son's 28th birthday. It's conveniently located near Farrer MRT. The ambience was very pleasant. Spacious & bright.There was an open concept kitchen. Lots of variety from sushi to pizza, porridge, fried rice, noodles to pasta, bryani with so many accompanying side dishes to prata, popia to kueh pie-tee & dessert table had lots of appetising sweet desserts incl durian cup. So rich&good. Soft Drinks were replenished promptly. There was coffee & tea (choice of Earl Grey/English Tea etc).Overall service was good. Very pleasant waiting staff
4
Enjoyable selection of International cuisine. Satay is very tender and tasty, loved the almond chocolates! I'm usually very fussy about my cakes, and the ones provided were excellent! Main gripe is that the seafood basket served to the table was sub-par: tiny langoustines and tasteless crayfish. The prawns from the buffet counter were excellent though. Good value for money with the Chope 1-for-1deal.
5
Our Family dinner for 12 was amazing! the food is ample and variety is good. was surprised as they have designated single servings of ICED seafood and KL Hokkien Mee which when served took us by surpise as we had eaten quite a bit by then. still it is tasty and nice service is good and prompt with coffee and tea served and in plentiful supplies for us Caffeine addicts. they serves TWG earl greys so think of the standardsonly complain was when it comes to settlihg bills as the queue is long and it took 30 mins to pay a bill 
3
had the lunch buffet on a thursday. happy to see that it's not packed. probably because the hotel is relatively new and not exactly the "touristy" kind of hotel. food spread has a good mix of local, asian and western dishes. not too shabby not also not impressionable. seafood wasn't very fresh. hot food items are worth second helpings. dessert bar is pretty good. staff are friendly and service was warm and prompt. will re-visit if more 1 for 1 deal and hope they rotate the dishes
4
My friends and i went there. I think the Service is good and Food is not variety.however, the food is tasty.
5
It's my second visit in 3 days and the staff has shown me the same great standard of service. The buffet was great value for money and they gave us two complimentary seafood platters!
4
Good ambience, staffs are very attentive. Food taste good, it will be better if have more choices. One highlight, Oyster is very fresh!!
4
The spread of the food is more than decent, and the quality is worth the price during the 1-1 promo.
4
We went there for Sat lunch buffet. Food and environment is very good for us. But one thing bad is the food only replenish once during our two hours stay there.
5
Food selection and variety are to my liking. Staff are friendly and helpful. Ambience is comfortable. I enjoyed the 1-for-1 promotion.
3
A mix of asian and western spread, food that's seldom at buffet like popiah, mee rebus. Visited it during 1-for-1 promotion so it was worth the price.
5
Went there for weekend dinner buffet with my family and we really enjoyed the food and ambience.The variety is widespread ranging from starter, seafood, Chinese food, Indian food, sashimi, dessert and many more. The seafood and sashimi is really fresh and each person is given a portion of seafood included in the buffet.Waiter and waitress constantly clear our used plates and refill water / ask for coffee/tea/soft drinks.Definitely a must try and very convenient from mrt
4
My family and I have been coming here for the buffet lunch and dinner 4 times over the past 3 months (with the most recent just over the last weekend) and so you will know that we like this place very much.The ambience of the restaurant is cosy, trendy and classy, very comfortable and lovely environment for diners. Sofas, in particular, are very comfortable.While the buffet spread may not have offered as many dishes like some others, I must say that the quality of the food is extraordinary and nice. Seafood in particular, are fresh! And most of the dishes here are well executed and yummy (generally, they do offer Western, Chinese, Japanese and Indian dishes). I would like to compliment the culinary team for a job well done.And what we also like include the desserts and pastries. Their chocolate cake, Tiramisu, Durian Panget, among others, are superb though they may be a bit too sweet (for me, which may not for you)!Service is great too. Not only our used plates and utensils are regularly cleared without the need to notify the staff to do so, our ice water is also frequently refilled. Upon your order, coffee will be specially brewed for you from its unique coffee cylinder. Smiles are always on the staff faces and they are polite, not to mention efficient and attentive too! From time to time, they will also pop by and ask for feedback over the food, that shows how serious the culinary team is placing on the diners! Awesome.And we of course enjoy every of our visit here and it is really good value for money and will definitely revisit again.I hope they will keep up with the good work and maybe add on more dishes and it will be perfect
4
There's quite a variety of food and it was satisfying, but I can't say so for the desserts. Cake were too dry, cream puff had a weird taste, creme brulee was so so.Not much service from their crew, had quite a bit of the DIY sections, so you gotta make your own popiah / kheh pie te
5
A wide variety of choices were available. Me and my friends were vey satisfied with the food and the service there.
5
The spread is good. The service is great! The ground staff are very courteous too. And it is not very crowded and not noisy at all.
3
The varieties are actually extremely limited. The taste is average. Staff are extremely polite and helpful. Would consider going back? Maybe...
5
Ordered food from the Asian section of the menu. The menu includes European, American and Asian food. The food was high quality, beautifully presented and the service was good. Suitable for children.

I stumbled upon this restaurant by chance and made a booking for a family birthday celebration on a Sunday. Due to a promotion, we had a 50% of the total bill and for that price, the deal was fantastic. What impressed diners are: not an overcrowded restaurant. good range of food and seafood selection. Serving plates used were beautiful and food tastefully presented. Usually at buffet, one can expect beverage bars to be self-service but in this restaurant, coffee was made from freshly grounded beans and served to the diner according to your specific orders.Now, this is service! For seafood lovers, this is heaven. Oysters are opened right before your eyes and served to you fresh. We had a few surprises on our table included two large servings of seafood choices (so that we need not go back and forth the buffet bench) and durian fried rice courtesy of the kitchen in trying out new dishes. Overall, nice service staff with a personal touch. If you are looking for a combination of gourmet, exquisite and intricate dishes, this might not be restaurant for you. If otherwise I highly recommend this restaurant

A quiet buffet area above Farrer NEL station. It was a building with hosiptal connected to hotel. A little weird but the building looks highend. Buffet spread average as the food were all in small plates & portion. Price considered expensive at $80 per pax for the spread ie basic sushi rice, wonton, loti prata, corn soup, bread, 1type of pizza; better foodies choice fresh oysters, pasta etc. A place for quiet gathering and you will hear Jazz from behind lounge on Sat evening 8pm.
4
I stayed at the hotel and had a dinner and a couple breakfasts. Breakfasts are included with the room. All very nice. Good selection of Asian delights but not so good western choices. Well, we are in Singapore so we don't really crave for western foods. Last night dinner i was impressed with the Chinese food section and love the the stir fried fresh seafood, cooked in front of us after we choose the materials. For breakfast this morning i was impressed with the freshness of the salads and fruits, and two kinds of porridge, Cantonese and Teo Chew. Both were delicious. We'll looking forward to having breakfast again tomorrow
5
Had lunch here and was highly impressed by the quality of the food and excellent service. The buffet was expansive and presented a wide selection of fresh and tasty dishes. The a la carte menu ordered off a notebook is also solid. Aside from the superb food, the particular service rendered by Anadaraj was noteworthy. He attended to our special dietary needs and was exceedingly pleasant and obliging
4
The food was very good and the oysters were fresh and big. Sashimi was very good and they had a chef on station to slice whichever they had. service was good (refill of water / clearing of plates). Chefs not really good with service on the other hand. They were slow and looked disinterested. A pity since the food was good.

Irresponsible ESCAPE restaurant @ One FarrerA very bad service and bad image of ESCAPE @ One Farrer.We booked the restaurant for our Team Lunch in ESCAPE @ One Farrer through EATIGO. The time that EATIGO shows is 11.30am, but the restaurant only open at 12.00pm. The restaurant did call up to tell us earlier on this opening time. This reflect that the EATIGO information is incorrect. The worst case is, we went to ESCAPE as a big team of 16 persons. Hence, we have to be separated into 2 tables as per arrangement of the restaurant. We are ok with this arrangement as we do understand that we are in a big group. But when we left the restaurant, the restaurant call us to go back and mentioned that they calculate the bill wrongly! EVEN WORST IS THEY BLAME US AND MENTIONED THAT WE DID NOT TELL THEM WE ARE SAME GROUP!!!!! HELLOOOO, we booked together and you guys arrange us in 2 different TABLES. ESCAPE STILL ABLE TO BLAME US???!!!! PLEASE BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN DINE IN ESCAPE
3
The food standard has dropped between my first visit about 2 months ago and my last visit over the weekend. Even after getting a 1-for-1 offer, we felt that we didn't get much value.
4
I would recommend this restaurant to others
The 1-1 Amex promotion is value for money
The restaurant is clean and the service staffs are very professional
I like the way the restaurant provide lemon water for cleansing - considerate!
3
Food was very tasty, everything was perfect except that the tea they served me was lukewarm and my table didn't have condiments of salt pepper and sugar, had to hunt for it, when i asked for those, i only got sugar.
4
The service was awesome and friendly staff. Staff make the effort to explain what type of food they have and they even offer to make coffee for me. Food is average.

Spacious and inviting, this restaurant and lounge was serving a Christmas buffet on the evening I was there. The restaurant has booth seats (very comfortable) and regular tables. I noticed the interesting plates the restaurant used for their guests.The buffet spread had a combination of Western and Asian dishes with live stations (sushi, pasta, etc.). The three flavours of ice-cream are also served individually scooped, so handy for the patrons and also more hygienic. This also means the team members need not clean out the ice-cream scoop each time it gets too messy. Service was prompt as the service team members cleared our used plates timely and the kitchen team members were extremely accommodating.Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience
4
This restaurant is attached to the new One Farrer Hotel & Spa, and only opened only 3 or 4 months ago and the restaurant,, avaialble to the public from the street level as well as via the hotel is also brand new. Visited for dinner to see what the new Farrer Park Hotel and it's area was like. The Escape is open 24/7 so you can eat whenever you want. The buffet for dinner is S$60 but includes a terrific range of food from sushi, sashimi, crab, cheese plates, salads, soups, a wide array of Indian and other Asian food, soups, breads and wonderful deserts. We went a-la-carte as not hungry enough to do justice to the wide array available but will go back to seriously stress out the stomach muscles. The service was really excellent. Attentive, low key, very friendly but professional, clean and well presented. if you have reason to be at the Farrer Park Hospital or the attached clinics, then this is an excellent venue for a meal, coffee, relaxing drink in the bar area. Really a very good restaurant, good food, plenty of choices, any kind of drink and wine you want and available always. Great start for this restaurant and they should do well. I highly recommend the Escape Restaurant & Ba

Amazing service, wrote in my booking that Im having a birthday celebration and they prepared a slice of cake for me and even offered for the band to sing a birthday song. Plates from buffet were cleared often, service crew was attentive and efficient. Food choices were a limited with a small range of stuff, mostly malay and indian dishes available. Oysters however were gorgeous and plump! Seafood was satisfying but other dishes were just mediocre. Wished there was a wider variety.The rest was mediocre
3
We were there to celebrate a belated birthday by buying lunch for the birthday girl. When I arrived (before the birthday girl) I mentioned to the server if she can arrange a small cake for the birthday girl at the end of the meal & she said OK. When lunch was over, I indicated to her to bring out the cake, she smiled & walked away (I tot she went to arrange for it)..........We waited for 20 mins, I waved at the same server again to prompt her to bring out the cake as we were having our coffee by now and another 20 odd mins went by & no cake arrived. By this time, my other friend has send me a sms to ask me "to forget it, don't belittle yourself" by reminding them a 3rd time. As it was a surprise lunch for the birthday girl, we didn't share with her what has happened but as a customer, I'm disappointed with the standard of the restaurant/server
4
We had a very good buffet lunch here. The service is good and the food is tasty. The pastry chef is very good so we enjoyed the desserts very much. They even threw in a free birthday cake for our staff who have their birthdays this month. Nice of them
4
Was looking for a nice buffet at a reasonable price and remembered this restaurant from a previous family celebration. With the Palate Club promotion of 35% discount from American Express, the choice was a no-brainer. They had a good mix of dishes - not too extensive that you end up not knowing what to choose, but just the right amount of dishes for the different cuisine. Service staff was also very friendly and professional
4
They have a fantastic restaurant, Loved the food here. Such a nice, hygienic & tasty food. Loved the Indian main course.
4
Unique variety of local food, good ambience, friendly chefs and quality service provided. Highly recommended

Almost a yearn never visited decided to lunch with the on going promotion. upon arrival greeted by Fadhil with a friendly smile and led us to our requested seat.The place is same cosy and clean.The staff is well trained,attentive and observant.Fadhil is a good host, he will occassionally come around to ask how is the food need anything else.But the standard of food has dropped, some food are limited like the seafood we only found prawns and crab,the chinese station was roast poultry, fried mee and stewed pork.luckily we found the dessert and ice cream amazing.overall is exxcellent value for food and service with such good ambiece

I've been to the Escape Dinner buffet 3 times in 6 months. It started off very well last December. Good ambience lovely roasts and chilli crab. But my third time in June/July 2016 was a very different experience. They appeared to be rationing food by slowing down the cooking process. I could only secure ONE small piece of salted egg crab at 7.15pm. Then nothing for quite sometime. Then the dish became crayfish. Not fresh tasting. Very different from crab. The crabs never returned.  Strangely there appeared to be nothing very delicious or much to eat. Desserts were poor as usual. No more cold lobsters. Overall it has become a poor value. So I would be a little more careful about returning. The good thing is that I went home hungry after the buffet. Something that I seldom do
3
Visited for dinner on monday because of a 50% promotion.Variety of spread was good if you have a small stomach. Don't expect the sort of variety found at The Line or Melt.Seafood - there were prawns, mussels, clams and oysters.Small selection of salads and cheeses but i couldn't find my fav brie.Cooked food - best was the black pepper crayfish.Live stations - roast beef, popiah and kueh pie tee, laksa and pasta.Desserts - choc fondue, fruits, cakes and durian pengat.Portions are small but that means the chefs will cook a fresh batch on the spot. Fresh and piping hot
5
The ambiance is good. The service there also very good, they clear your used plates very often so you are able to get more food without having a messy table. The seafood there are fresh, they top up the oysters, prawns, clams very often. It's a great place for family or friends gathering.Tips: You can try booking through some apps, there are discounts up to 50% per person
3
It's an ok restaurant for a 4 star hotel, not 5 star. Service was fine, the ambience during daytime is not luxuries as you can see the grey buildings outside. The food was ok, but the price was a bit steep. Most people seemed to go for the buffet which may offer better value
4
Dined in here with parents!Let's start with the atmosphere: great setting of lights and music. The lighting is perfect for meals and sound level was just enough to have conversations. Not to loud. Staffs: The service staff was friendly and greeted us almost immediately upon seeing us. They also took notice of our empty plates on the table removed it immediately. All the staffs were well trained in their looks and everyone definitely had a smile on their faces Food: food variety was good. There were selections of Indian, Chinese and Indonesian food. Some French cheese added to the international flavors. The best part of the buffet was the live seafood station and pasta station. You can take the seafood selection and get the chef to make it fresh as per your requirements(salted egg, chili or black pepper). Chef were friendly and took good care of the food. Sushi counters and salad counter also added to the great selection of food. Last but not least; DESSERTS! The dessert selection was good, ranging from ice cream to many different cakes and a fresh chocolate fountain. Overall, the restaurant is fantastic for a great dinner with friends and family. Highly recommended

I guess as a little - known standalone hotel , I wasn't expecting much when I made a rsvn. at ' Escape ' . But I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service . Good alternative to usual run - of - the - mill options , I'd go back

The all-day dining restaurant is located at the first floor of One Farrer Hotel & Spa, Opens 24 hours 7 days a week, it offers buffet breakfast ($30++), buffet lunch ($45++) and buffet dinner ($60++). Currently the restaurant is having a 1-for-1 buffet lunch or buffet dinner on Sunday and Monday through reservations booked through HungryGoWhere website and mobile application (from 1 May till 30 June 2016).Besides offering buffets, the restaurant also offers a la carte dishes such as Teochew porridge set which consisted of sweet potato porridge, braised peanuts, braised beancurd skin in dark soya sauce, Mei Cai Kou Rou 梅菜扣肉 ( braised and steamed pork belly with preserved mustard greens), and steamed fish. This porridge set is available after the buffet hours from 10pm to 6am the next day.The restaurant looked small where compared some of the well known hotel buffet restaurants in Singapore, but the place was decorated elegantly decorated with comfortable seating arrangement. Open theatre kitchens dominated the buffet counters with a number of live stations.For tonight the main attraction turned out to be the Seafood station, which offered live cooking of seafood in salted egg sauce, black pepper sauce and chilli crab sauce, on top of the usual cold seafood. The station looked small, but the spread of seafood available was good enough to rival the usual big named buffet restaurants, with raw oysters, clams, mussels, prawns, crabs, and the uncommonly found mini lobster 小龙虾.Besides this, there was live stations for craving of roast beef, slicing of sashimi, cooking of pasta with 3 type of sauces available, and noodle of the day which was Mee Rebus for that day.The static stations offered a wide spread too. From assorted salads, to assorted soups, to assorted cheese, to assorted breads and breadsticks, to assorted dim sum, to assorted sushi and maki, to Indian cuisine spread (the restaurant had 2 Indian chefs), to Chinese cuisine spread, to other International cuisine spread. But the one that caught my attraction the most was the dessert spread, which had chocolate fondue, ice cream in cups, assorted cakes, assorted biscuits and Durian Pengat with condiments such as coconut milk, gula melaka syrup, green chendol jelly, sweet corn and red bean. Best get the Durian Pengat as soon as possible which ran out very fast but was replenished soon after
4
We tried the buffet. It was rich and delicious.
Good wine list also.
Staff was smiling and professional.
5
Great food and excellent service by Mr. Ibrahim with his team. They have a lot of varieties and fresh oysters. Will definitely come back again..

Straight off the plane from Australia and staying at One Farrer Hotel, decided to eat at Escape. Menu is on a pre-loaded tablet with photos of each dish. Nice! I was in the mood for some genuine Malay peninsula satay; found it in 'Snacks' tab.But oh how wonderful it was....3 sticks of grilled lamb, 3 sticks of grilled chicken, accompanied by rice cake in banana leaves, cucumber and onion, and the satay sauce served in its own small cast iron pot. Heaven! It is Real Satay. Others were enjoying the $60 buffet which did look amazing. I was delighted with my satay.Chose a German Pinot Gris to accompany - a wine afficiniado's choice.
3
My third visit. Quiet ambience. Attentive service. Good variety despite the small counter spaces (though in small quantities) but refill was reasonably fast. Their Asian foods seemed better than their western. Labelling could have been better (e.g. potato gratin was labelled as mashed potato instead). Vegetables fried on the spot for you was a pleasant and welcome addition. Missed their "bak kut teh" which was superb and comparable to one of the better "bak kut teh" eateries in Singapore

After some disappointing lunch, we decided to have dinner in our hotel, in One Farrer Hotel. There is a restaurant, called Escape Restaurant & Lunch. The setup is very elegant, plenty of attentive waiters were ready to jump and fulfill our wishes. There was a choice in between a buffet and an a la cart dinner.We weren't hungry enough for a buffet dinner, so decided to pick up something from the menu. My companion choice was a Bak Kut Teh, and I wanted to have a sushi plate, but it wasn't available. Hoping, that his choice was right, I joint to him. It was a mistake. Bak Kut Teh looks very nice on the picture, and promising even in in the reality. Unfortunately it didn't provide us a pleasurable dinner. It contained a Peppery Pork Rib Soup, Braised Soy Chicken Wing, You Tiao, Preserved Vegetables, and Jasmine Rice.What can I say? Everything was edible, but we left at least half of it on the plate.Luckily the price was reasonable. In the aspects of the food it was an unlucky day
5
They have one of the best concept of a buffet.. Oysters, crab, lobster, prawns, cooked food!!! For 30++ using the eatigo app... It's dirt cheap!! It's fresh!!! Lyk a home kitchen concept... A lot of things r quite open!!! My 2nd time!!!! Do come down if u wanna eat an international buffet at this place!

Went to Escape without much expectations for my recent Sunday buffet dinner with my family.Honestly, I didn't think much about the hotel from the exterior view. Woww, I am impressed firstly by the spacious car park lots and next is the lift which still smelled "new". Lovely simply decorated lobby with bunches of well co-ordinated colourful fresh flowers placed as the centre stage.Escape has very courteous and alert staff, even over the telephone to make reservation was a breeze and very friendly as well.The buffet spread varieties were all very delicately spread out without one feeling overwhelmed by it and looses ones appetite.Though the "International" spread is not that extensive but sufficient. I did not even have stomach room to actaully sample each and everyone of it.Great idea to have those "crackers" placed in a heated covered stand. I enjoyed the Chinese crispy roasted pork , which was very well done. The fresh sea food range such as lobster; prawns and crabs were really fresh and enticing. Local laksa was tasty and I like the Indian food section as well. Chawanmushi very well presented in a tiny bowl which is inside the dimsum steamer .Oh the yummy Hokkaido sweetcorn creamy soup was a delight too.Ohhhh love the dessert . I love the very "solid" durian penyet, Every mouthful able to get a bite the pulpTWG tea was served as included in the buffet. I love the fined porcelain/clay serving dishes used. Nothing to dislike about Escape, the set up is cosy too. However, I find the price rather steep and that would deter quite a bit of diners. For those who drive, spend $100.00 and above, you will be given a complimentary car park ticket.Worth a try and visit for those who do not mind the price and familiar with the location
4
This restaurant has an excellent breakfast buffet. I haven't tried it for lunch but we had dinner there the second night having arrived very late the first night. We had eaten a big Chinese lunch so we didn't feel justified spending S$68 pp on the dinner buffet which I'm sure is as good as the breakfast. We decided to try the local speciality Bak Kut The instead which is half the price of the buffet (I don't recall the exact price) but much less food. We weren't that impressed. The food was edible but not something I would order again, especially the meat. Bak Kut Teh is meant to be a late night snack (supper) although they will serve you anything from their menu pretty much anytime of the day (and room service from the same kitchen is 24/7)
4
This restaurant looks lovely and I always enjoy it when I can see the kitchen and the chefs working. My main course was lovely (beef with flat noodles) but unfortunately my dessert was not as nice. I had ordered the lemon cheesecake but i couldn't taste any lemon. However, there was a very strong taste of cheese. Overall a nice restaurant with a good menu.
3
Food tastes good but the menu does not change much for the breakfast and dinner buffet. Those dining here for more than a couple of consecutive days will get bored very quickly. Prices can be quite high when compared with the portions for the ala carte menu items but there is no denying that the food tastes good
