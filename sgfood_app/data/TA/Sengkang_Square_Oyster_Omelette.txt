On 25 August me and my boyfriend bought hokkien mee at this stall. But when the hokkien mee is ready to collect, I ask whether did they put chili. 1 of a guy staff was really kind and help me check and he straight away remove the chili for me and replaced a new one for me. I was really happy and was really greatful. I have been supporting this stall satay and hokkien mee and char kway teow. It was really nice. Always when I went over and buy it is always having long queue. But they have a fast and good service. Even though they cook really fast. But their quality of food is still very good. I will support this stall more often

Despite the 'oyster omelette' tag in its name, this food court stall in Kopitiam Square, serves more than just that. Depending on the time of day, different dishes are likely to be more popular. Oyster omelette tends to be eaten for lunch or dinner, fried carrot cake (chye tau kuay), be it plain or darkened, tends to be an all-day (or -night) favourite, while fried flat-rice noodles (char kuay teow) also tends to be popular most times of the day. Because it's open 24/7, it's a convenient fall-back option when peckishness strikes. I also find it interesting that every time I visit the stall, there are different staff manning it, no doubt due to their extensive opening hours. Don't expect great service (there isn't any at a food court), and there's often a queue, but the food will be decent an generally satisfying
