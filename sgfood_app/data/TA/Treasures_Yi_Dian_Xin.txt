Have not been served in the way I need not to even think of what to order but service has recommended me quite a good selection of dim sum contemplated with noodles and Chinese BBQ as well. Service (lunch and dinner) are rushing but flawless with the Chinese way of restaurant management. Service team has done a great job for this bustling busy outlet. Open kitchen concept is interesting sirena to tourists whom had limited exposure to Chinese kitchen. Definitely a worth visit to this place. Apologize that the food was so good until I forgot to take pictures

The service staff were prompt and friendly in attending us. Getting a table, ordering, food serving were pretty quick. We ordered the wanton noodles soup and a few other dimsum to go along with our mains. The wanton noodles wasn’t really the best in our opinion but I guess the service made it up. One thing that slightly bothered me was that the staff came to our table twice to ask us to finish up the food. It felt like they were rushing us but I kindly told the staff we were not done yet. Overall still a good experience

We were there on a Saturday for lunch. Had dim sum and they were really tasty and good. The service was also very good. The servers were all friendly and attentive

Here we were 2 Australians in a Asian restaurant in Singapore and we were the only ones that I saw, the service was magic the food was so good (a lot of competition and they would not survive without it) the décor was adequate and overall a pleasant dining experience

Expensive and unpleasant experience. Food portions very small given the cost but then they were very bland anyway - crispy pork the least appealing plate we have ever had. One particular staff member continually tried to up sell. I asked if the Evian water was still or sparkling - I was told it was sparkling - of course it wasn't. They even charge per glass for tap water. There are so many cheaper and more tasty options in the vicinity - don't waste your money here. I am generally pretty laid back about dining but this place has made me angry enough to write a negative review

The porridge and dim sum here is good. Especially the steam diced mushroom dumpling and the pan fried water choice dumpling are really good. However service is lacking, the wait staff is always rushing, even clearing the dim sum bowl when there is still one piece of dumpling left.

We love Yum Cha and the food we had here did not fail to impress. You can see in to the kitchen which has all the Peking ducks and pork belly hanging up. The chefs waved at us a couple of times. We had a few items we had not had before and really enjoyed the har gao and other dumplings we had. We had a fried crispy shrimp rice roll and really enjoyed that. The waitress tried to be friendly but I think she was trying to get us to order more food! Would have loved to try the duck but too full. Was very reasonably priced for the quality. A definite re visit next time we are in Singapore

Staff mindlessly clearing our plates and dishes before we could even put the food properly in our mouths. A most stressful and unpleasant eating experience ever

Was shopping at Raffles City Shopping Centre today. Wanted to have lunch at Prego. Was told they serve buffet on Sunday only (no ala carte).Walked around and settled for Treasure Yi Dian Xin (一点心) by Imperial Treasure. Clean spacious cosy restaurant located at basement 1. Open concept kitchen. Polite helpful service staff with prompt action. Ordered few dim sum and century egg congee.Congee （皮蛋粥） was smooth. Bbq pork bun （叉烧包） was also good. Shrimp Dumpling (虾饺），Siew Mai (烧卖) were good too. Mushroom dumpling (姑饺) tasted crunchy and really tasty. Water chestnut cake (马蹄糕） was sweetly crunchy. Really enjoyed.2 persons inclusive of iced honey lemon cost $52 all inclusive. Will visit again

Suffering from a bad case of toothache but shying from going to a dentist. Ok more like fear.Walking around the basement of Raffles City looking for something soft to eat. Ended up at this dian xin place, Imperial Treasures.Found the porridge (fish and century egg) with a thumbs up. So I ordered it.Har gao and Siew mai were impulse orders.Loved the porridge. Very well marinated ingredients and soft mushy porridge. Just nice for my swollen gums and cheek.Har gao was tiny. But the taste was very acceptable. Siew mai fresh and solid.Good experience. Especially at 4pm on Sunday.Very peaceful

Had dinner here earlier this week! My families truly enjoy the food! Service is very friendly and they took care of us! Great food too! Will be back. Love their porcupine red bean!

Came during lunch time and was surprise that the wait isn't long. Ordered Congee with fish and century egg, roasted duck, soy chicken & steamed chicken. Dim Sum selection also nice especially the signature charcoal salted egg bun look so unique. Overall rating was good.

Came here for dinner last night. Love most of the food that we ordered. Very nice service. Definitely would come back.

Came here for dinner to celebrate mum's birthday as it is centrally located. Ordered 7 dishes plus a noodles and a fried rice. All of the dishes are delicious. And the service is good too.

I enjoy the wide range of congee served in this restaurant as most of them are generally tasty and delicious. Service is also very good too, although the seating for some areas are pretty tight. As it is very popular among the locals and there is no reservation of seats, do go during 'off-peak' hours. They are open throughout the day, so unlike many restaurants that have a break in the mid afternoon, it is better to drop by before the lunch and dinner crowd comes in

I love all the Imperial Treasure group of restaurants. The food is always excellent and most times the service is great. I especially love their Beijing roast duck. But not this particular branch, I should have learnt my lesson, but I just love their dim sum. The first experience, as it was always crowded during lunch time, I understand that I need to take a number, which I did, and I asked the lady serving staff how long approximately before my number would be called, she said about 20 minutes. So, since I am in a shopping centre, I told her I will browse and will be back later. After about twenty minutes, I came back, and realised that the queue number had moved beyond my queue number, likely my number had been called. I approached the same lady, she flatly told me that I missed my number, and I will have to wait, I understood, and the usual practice is; I will be called for the next available seat. Boy, was I wrong to assumed that; she kept calling the other number and skipped my queue number, all while I was standing right in front of her. I asked her why my number was not called, she again, flatly told me that I missed my number. I felt Like I was being punished for not waiting there for twenty minutes. It is not a pleasant experience at all, and the service level from the front of the reception area are entirely different when you are in the restaurant, I know because I have visited this particular branch at least once a week and loved the food as well as the service up till then. I have been to many Imperial Treasure restaurants all over Singapore, this branch by far has the worst front of restaurant service

We love the congee, aromatic and smooth! The Singapore fried meehoon is also good, not too oily, right texture, nice aroma and taste. The roasted meats were great too. Overall, we had very good service from our waitress who listened patiently and made suggestions when we were undecided on what to eat
3
We tried the liver congee, wanton and chicken dry noodles, BBQ pork bun and shrimp rice roll. Everything was pretty average, no where near the quality of Imperial Treasure restaurants. Staff tries to get you to order more. Much better value for the same quality of food can be found in the Raffles City food court.

Arranged to have lunch with 2 other friends on a weekday. Went to the counter to get a table but was told that all needs to arrive before we can seat. Told the staff my friend was on the way and will arrive in 5 minutes, however, my friend arrived in 10 mins and we were scolded by the counter staff for giving her the wrong info. Ordered the ee fu mian, bad choice, better to stick to noodles or hor fun instea

I have ate here twice and the food was very average and service also average.The second time I went there with my husband. Restaurant was full and we had to get a number and wait. Then one table for 4 became empty by the entrance. The waitress refused to give it to us since we were only 2. This is what I hate most about restaurants. So damn petty and mean. We walked away and I am never going back again

Came here for dinner, service was good. The lady who served us answered our questions about the dishes nicely. Food came pretty fast, but not amazing. Price was considered high for food with this standard.

I should have read others' negative reviews before I had ever stepped this restaurant.We ordered warm water for drink, were abruptly told by the female staff, 'Do you know it is chargeable eh?' I'm well aware of that and we're certainly able to afford it. To my greatest horror, after drank a sip, I found a huge lipstick stain which didn't belong to me on the cup of 'do you know it is chargeable' water! I showed the lip-stick cup to another female staff, she simply took it away and brushed me off with a quick 'Oh sorry huh'. We ordered 1 beef noodle, which was mediocre. The 2 porridges (with sliced fish and with fish head) we had were the worst porridge I have eaten, incredibly watery and tasteless. Disgusting experience overall

Craving DimSum and it's quite a nice place to go. Dim sums priced from $5 onwards. Especially liked the soup dumpling $8 and the crispy prawn rice roll $7. Very yummy! The chicken & mushroom pie was also quite nice. Mushroom and veggie dumpling was kinda sticky and not a fave of mine. The salted egg custard bun is ok. Abit small more like a mini bun. On the whole alright... $44 including tax for 2 persons ordered 6 items with 1 tea. Service was rather friendly for Chinese restaurant. Usually they are quite curt. But maybe it's a weekday afternoon with not many guests so they had time to pay some attention. But not That attentive either la, alright...Will I be back? Yes when I'm craving DimSum. Especially like the soup dumpling & crispy prawn rice roll! Tasty!

This is the few Chinese Restaurants that stays open on Chinese New Year Eve. While they do not serve porridge, noodle soup and dim sum on CNY eve, they do serve other Chinese food. We ordered Yang Zhou Fried Rice and Seafood Rice Vermicelli - and they were delicious. The staff were also friendly even though they were working overtime during a public holiday

I agree with several other reviewers about the rudeness of the staff. The food was mediocre, with the dim sum somewhat overcooked, and the noodles rather mushy. It was somewhat expensive. Worst of all was the staff who had a fit when they saw some food we were carrying. I removed it from their sight. They demanded we take it outside, even though we ordered their food and ate it, but they were obsessed. I asked the manager what are you going to do about it, and they said nothing. They even sent another person to harass us and we ignored her. I don't know what they expect to accomplish by such treatment of their customers but it guarantees we will not be back

We had to wait for about 15 minutes in order to get a table. It was worth the wait as the food we ordered was excellent. From the dumplings to the fried rice to the noodles and sautéed chicken, the taste and service were very good

I was there at 11 am this morning to meet my friend for lunch. I was literally chased away by a very impatient staff who felt that we were taking too long over lunch. Black face as she cleaned our table and told us rudely that we need to get going!I was there last Thursday with another friend. I was recommended some double boiled clear soup which cost $10 more than the usual soup but was not informed. I wanted to order the soup of the day $9.00 but was persuaded by the waitress to order the clear double boiled soup $18.00. It is ok to recommend but for goodness sake, let the customers know the price

Food was amazing but rude people. Even the supervisor Esther was rude.Understand that we cannot consume outside drinks here but when we brought in takeaway coffee from Toast Box they seem to give us an attitude and mentioned (不可以喝， 外面已经有写了）and went ahead to complain that we brought in drinks even though we didn't drink it. I find that really offensive as a gentle reminder will suffice given we did order quite a bit plus they don't even serve coffee.

This the restaurant were I tried Congee for the first time so for me a special place. For the other dishes is it good but very special

We had a simple meal here. Two bowls of noodles and one bowl of Cantonese congee. They were delicious. The congee was cooked to perfection. The wantons and the dumplings were also great
