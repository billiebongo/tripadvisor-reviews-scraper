This stall has been around for decades and my kids grew up eating here. The prices has always been lower than elsewhere. My favourite is the Laksa and it usually runs out before 11am on weekends. I also like the Kwaytiow Mee soup. If you are cycling along Sungei Pandan, you should stop here to try this noodle. Very very local flavour
