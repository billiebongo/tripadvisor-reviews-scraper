People giving five star ratings for the coffee here are not exaggerating. Delicious coffee and a pleasant place to hang out (opens 10am) before Sim Lim opposite opens for business (around 11:30am). Basic and cluttered inside, but clean and friendly. Highly recommended.

I have been to this place many times every visit to Singapore and they never fail to make excellent coffee! Coffee addicts should try this one!

We went for coffees today. Flat White looks not appealing at all. The taste were weak.
Nice place but can't deliver a good Flat White to me.
No service for this place.. Pay and walk back to get your coffees when it's ready.

Chance upon this coffee cafe near Sim Lim Square & opposite LaSalle School of Art. The cafe served speciality coffee. We tried their cappaccino & americano. Their earl grey cake is delicious. A must try to go along w the coffee.

2 in shop roasters with lots of coffee related accessories. I felt like I am in Japan. No comments on food as we didn't order any food.

The coffee was very good though. We only found this place because we were looking for somewhere (anywhere, in fact) for a much-needed afternoon coffee. It is somewhat tucked away behind Burlington Square and faces the LaSalle Arts College. We arrived and were the only people there apart from the Shanghainese owner. Only one young lady dropped by whilst we were, to collect a takeaway food order, I think.The selection of coffees is good, with some extremely expensive, prize-winning and exotic beans if you wish. There was a food menu, with mostly noodles and toppings, no doubt favourites of the owner. Don't be put off by the slightly ramshackle interior of the cafe. It is basically decent, but unpretentious

I stumbled on this place a few weeks ago and just had my second cuppa. The coffee is great. It seems to be owned by coffee enthusiasts that are very serious about what they do. The cafe is small and there are hardly any food options but the coffee is one of the better ones I've had in Singapore. For $4, you get a really good flat white which saved my sanity. They share a space (I think) with a bakery that makes lovely cream puffs which go perfectly with the coffee. Cash only. Closes at 6pm.

This tiny cafe offers major flavor. Charming little spot run by the owners serves magnificent beans—fresh, fragrant, coffee with layers of flavor. My favorite is actually the iced latte—so gooood, such a perfect balance of espresso and milk! But maybe coffee connoisseurs are obsessed with flat whites, etc. Those are excellent and a good value. This is definitely the best coffee in the entire area and one of my top-three coffee places in all of Singapore. Nicest owners run the place and are very friendly. Also tasty little treats to eat

The coffee shop in the basement at the Sim Lim Square closed down and we found this through Trip Advisor. As entering the coffee shop, the shop was filled with the coffee fragrance! The coffee was fantastic... I say this place is a gem in the city near Sim Lim Square
