Nice little hawker center. There's a decent selection and I want to go back to try more of the hawkers. I've mainly been here for breakfast to get Indian. I high recommend the Indian food for Prata and Thosai. I bet all their other stuff is good. There are some good pastry and bread shops and a variety of drink stalls although only 1 makes kopi/coffee that tastes good for me. The prices are decent for food. If you're here to buy from the wet market places, I think the prices are slightly elevated but it's not bad. This isn't a huge place but if you're in the area or want a non-tourist hawker center, then this is a good stop

I 100% hand on heart recommend this place to eat... best and cheapest meals anywhere between $2.50- $5 AUD or US!! for a yummy big bowl or Char Siu or seafood dishes. Its like an outdoor food market or food court. Theres always a couple of stalls open but I believe everything is all open on saturday and sunday mornings. But I would go there every day every afternoon for lunch and dinner. I miss this place so muc

This is a hawker market, which has a lot of stalls but not a lot open. It's pretty simple, I had chicken and rice and a bowl of soup for $3! Can't go wrong for a cheap meal! There's other shops around, and an ATM if you needed cash out
