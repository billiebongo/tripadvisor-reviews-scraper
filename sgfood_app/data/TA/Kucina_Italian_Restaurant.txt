More like Pasta Mania kind of quality, nothing to shout about. Went for lunch, ordered a Bolognese & Potato Pasta, both were very salty. Not many customers but took so long to prepare the dishes, portion is small, rather disappointed.

We were bit disappointed after reading quite a few positive reviews. The food quality was average, equal to Pizza Hut opposite to this restaurant. Setting is slightly nicer. We were especially disappointed about the service; the restaurant was quite empty, but staff did not keep an eye on us, when our glasses were empty, we were done with our meal and they did not even come along during dinner to check if everything was ok.

The ambience of this restaurant is authentic. The menu is also extensive and there is a wide variety of dishes to choose from.Dinner was the Fettuccine in Mushroom Cream Sauce with Black Truffle and Fusilli with Basil Pesto and Potatoes. Both were tasteful. I also ordered the Margherita Pizza topped with tomato and mozzarella to the meal, which came in one size only. Again, it was cooked to perfection. The service was attentive as the table was cleared often. Overall, the dining experience was pleasant

I never knew of a Halal Italian restaurant till I came across Kucina Italian Restaurant, located in the basement of the mall. The ambience is authentically Italian and I love everything about it except for the type of music played over its sound system. It would be appropriate to have Italian instead of English songs.The menu is extensive and well designed. In keeping with its authenticity, the names of the dishes are written in Italian with descriptions in English. There is a wide variety of dishes one can choose from the different categories.My partner and I ordered the Fettuccine in Mushroom Cream Sauce with Black Truffle and Fusilli with Basil Pesto and Potatoes. Both were tasty pasta dishes. We also added the Margherita Pizza topped with tomato and mozzarella to the meal. It comes in only one size and the portion is huge. Again, it was cooked to perfection with basil leaves laid out on top of the cheese topping.We experienced somewhat attentive service as our table was cleared often but our drinking glasses were not topped up. Overall, the restaurant performed well but there is always room for improvement

I believe is the best restaurant in Singapore serving halal food.You can find several italian dishes but nothing containg pork. The place is very nice and the food is good too. Some ingredients of course are not those usually used in Italy but you can still find it delicious.Italian desserts are the best of the best... try tiramisu or tiramisu cup cake... SUPE

i ordered Pizza and Panna Cotta for dinner. the Panna Cotta was sour and curdled! It has gone Bad for at least 4 days. The waitress argued with me that Panna Cotta is supposed to be hard. I have had many times and have also made myself so I know how it should look like. I was disgusted that they served dairy products that had gone bad to their customers! Absolute No-Go

We were regulars and used to love this place (I actually left a very good review here a few months back). But a few days ago, we were asked to come back to the store to return our take away pizza as there was a mix up in the order. Once we were back, I asked the chef if possible to reheat a bit since 15 mins had been wasted in the mix-up. He refused twice, with a despicable attitude and looking very visibly annoyed (my mistake if your staff mixed up the orders ?!?). Then, as I must have looked in shock by his very rude behavior, he said he would do them again and prepared the dough - still looking very pissed. I said no as I don't like wasting food... so we left with our cold pizza. No discount and no apologies (!!!!!!) were offered at anytime, this is not a way to treat loyal customers.

Went last night for iftar cum father's day dinner. Ambience is nice, food isn't too bad although a little pricey. We reserved a table for 5, walked in at 6.45pm and didn't quite like the table assigned to us. We asked if we can swap with a table just behind us since the guests hasn't arrived. We were denied on pre-text they have "keyed in their system so swapping might confuse their operation staffs". ok. Meals were served rather slow but we understand given all the patrons there were muslims but my husband's order didn't arrive even after waiting for 1hr. We had waiter and waitress to check but none revert back to us. A Chinese couple walked in at 8pm, ordered their pizza and got their order the next 15mins and we were still waiting for my husband's order (lasagne). So decided to cancel hubby's order and ask for bill. No apology from service staff, no thank you .. Won't be going anymore
