You cannot get such cheap prices for honest-to-good 'ol Western food. You wont regret! Your regret would be to come too late and not get a place to sit, so try making reservations. They do allow.Waiting time for food is very short: fast and efficient service. I will come back again

This little bistro located in the Kovan heartlands is actually a real gem, because it not only has good food, but the service is great and it is affordable as well!When we first arrived, the owner greeted us warmly and pointed us to our seats immediately. Service was really fast and they wasted no time in taking our orders and serving us water, even though we could grab water from the nearby canister ourselves.We ordered popcorn chicken, Knuckles' signature pasta and pork schnitzel, and they were delicious. Initially, I was afraid that the pork schnitzel would be too dry, but it was actually really tasty, just the way I like it. Unfortunately, for that night, the pork knuckles were already sold out, so we couldn't order that. It is their speciality and I will definitely be back to try that the next time. Still, the other food items were great too, and you can even come here for a beer or two with your friends to just chill in the heartlands
