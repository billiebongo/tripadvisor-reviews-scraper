The food is alright. One thing really annoyed us was the bill prices were higher than the menu prices. Be careful with this trick.

Hotel person suggested this restaurant to us the first night we were in Singapore. We sat outside. Food and beer were very good as was service. Reasonable cost. I think about $40 Singapore dollars.
3
I had dinner here and was satisfied with the food. I had a soup and noodles and everything was tasty. Service was nice.
5
Really good food and fantastic value. It is BYO wine, but they do sell beer. Definitely recommend. Very casual. Crispy skin duck was especially good.
5
Delicious food , reasonably priced in authentic restaurant with no nonsense service. Well deserved of it's high rating. Anything in black pepper highly recommended!
5
The Asian food is out standing, been going to Singapore since 1976 and had the pleasure of meeting Wing's Dad, been eating there ever since. Top food nice atmosphere good quanity for the price. Recommend it to every one.
5
Super family run restaurant. Food was delicious and plentiful. Menu offers a wide range of local food. The duck was the best for me. Beer is cold and service is great. Best value for your money for sure here.
5
Very nice people. We came in hungry , and the waitress din't let us to order to much because we can't eat all for sure . The food was very good also.
5
Best place to eat in Singapore. The food is so good, Butter Prawns, spring rolls, beef and black bean, chicken yam-pot - you cannot go wrong. Filled with expats, locals and visitors. We love to eat at the outside tables, so dress casually (very casual dining). Beers and the Lime juice both complement the food. Amy will make recommendations and tell you when you have ordered too much. All my visitors ask to return to Fatty's when next in town
5
I love Fattys. I have been eating there since 1992 ( it's moved since then ...but not far) The staff and food are the same....CONSISTENTLY GOOD  I have recommended this restaurant to many friends and it's where I go every time I visit Singapore ( every couple of years) I have tried a couple of dishes ....but pretty well ALWAYS order Claypot Chicken, Tiger Beer and LOTS of the yummy Fattys chillies. Can not wait to get back in June and then again in July

Next to Sim Lim complex, this restaurant has a long history. Nice typical Zi Cha dishes like fried rice, pork ribs, hor fun and double boiled soup!

Stopped in for a casual lunch and loved it. My wife loved the butter prawns and I am obsessed with the Indonesian chicken
3
I had a spring roll followed by the chicken with dried chillies. It was nice but pretty standard for that style of food. Nothing out of the ordinary so I was confused by the high Trip Advisor rating.
3
Full and buzzing on a Sunday night . Lots of manly Chinese families there so it's clearly popular.Tables were cleared and reset at great speed. .service was efficient, everything arrived randomly as it was cooked, the presentation of dishes was strictly functional. All the food tasted good and we ate it all, sharing every dish. It was very good value for a restaurant with such a good reputation, However, my wife came down with an intestinal bug within one hour which took three days of charcoal treatment to clear! I ate everything she did so we don't know what caused it. Unlucky I guess
4
This place is highly recommended especially amongst air crews which seems to be something they foster. Having grown from a hawker tradition since 1926, the restaurant shows its confidence by offering a range of foods not normally found elsewhere. It does also have delicious pork, beef, chicken, and rice dishes as well.Among the more fun things we tried:Frog legs with a garlic sauce, very tenderSpicy chicken and cashews surrounded by taro root pastry, quite flavoursome and not too hotSea cucumber in an oyster sauce, a bit bland franklyBeef and mushroom clay pot, very satisfyingChilli crab, very goodThey also had abalone which I did not try but looked goodDinner for two with tea was just over $100.Ambiance: standard Cantonese, ie noisy but in a normal kind of wayBasic tables and chairsOutdoor seating, roadside does not have that much trafficIndoor seating has good air conStaff are nice in a gruff but charming, hard of hearing, bossy aunty kind of wayWorth it if you are in the neighbourhood. If you want to then go somplace after there is the infamous Peace Centre nearby for adult activities or the much nicer family friendly Bugis plus mall a bit further away
5
This place is great! A friend put us on to this restaurant, which is conveniently located near Little India & just a block from the awesome Bugis Street night market!The exterior and seating is very plain, but the service and food are amazing!! Wash down the best Asian feed in Asia with 600ml stubbies of Tiger- Perfect!! we will be back!
5
Walked past a number of busy stalls/ restaurants to get here based on the TripAdvisor reviews and weren't disappointed. Had spring rolls, rice with chicken, sweet and sour pork and shredded duck noodles (all small) between 2 of us and although it seemed a lot of food when it arrived, we ate it all. Best was the pork but out was all delicious.
5
We just arrived in Singapore and went out for a quick bite to eat and yhis place was great. The duck was fantastic. The been hoon fish soup was fabulous and the vegetables were really fresh. We washed it down with ice cold beer and it was very reasonably priced
5
If you are in Singapore you just HAVE to eat here. It’s truly local and authentic and the flavours of all dishes were just sooooo good. We preordered two crabs and made one chilli crab and one black pepper crab. They were both absolutely delicious and fresh but I like the black pepper one more and it was just so flavourful and rich. You have to order the fried dough to dip the chilli crab gravy and it just tastes like heaven. The owner also cooked us a few special dishes for us and they were all seriously good. I am from Hongkong and I have pretty high expectation on this style of chicken and their chicken dish just went above my expectation. The meat was so tender and source on top goes so well with the meat. The salted egg prawn was also outrageously tasty and you may not find this flavour easily elsewhere! I genuinely think you just have to try this place as the tastes were just beyond what I can describe in words.
5
A mad Canadian friend and business colleague of ours who frequents Singapore convinced us to check out Fatties as this is one of his favourite eateries in Singapore. It’s a third generation family business where the focus is on great food at reasonable prices. Each dish that came out was a taste sensation, even the fried rice is a talking point. Great place to visit. The setting is nothing special, but then again the lack of detail and laid back scene is what makes it unique. You get the feeling here it’s do as grandad did and we will be just fine!
5
We were recommended this restaurant by a B.A. Pilot he tells us he eats there regularly when on London-Singapore flight....we were in Singapore 5 nights & ate here twice.....lots of shopping close by & sensibly priced...
5
We stumbled across this place and after a day exploring. Hot and tired we just dove in and they directed us to a table, staff were very attentive and friendly and food was Great! Highly recommend the chicken fried rice and Indonesian style chicken.
5
Took our family here. 3 children ages 6,7 and 9. Staff attentive to the kids. Food fresh- must try the spring rolls, massive and tasty! Sweet and sour chicken and pepper beef were a big hit. Went early so sat inside in air-conditioning. Great meal.
4
Been several times to this well-known established Chinese restaurant in Bencoolen street.
We had a round table outside and ordered several different dishes, all of them were delicious and tasty.
The price are really affordable, nothing fancy but good food
5
I've been here a few time on business trips and never they never fail to impress. This time a local person eating with us chose from the menu. We had a feast, inlcuding the most gorgeous duck breast dish I have ever had! This is now my new favourite
3
Came here for dinner and the place was very, very busy. They have indoor and outdoor seating. We made our way to tell the host how many and it was like 4 different people yelling to go one place then another, then wait, then another table. They then moved a table of people to put them at the table we sat at and moved us to their smaller table. It was organized chaos. Foodwise, when the menus were brought, there are no prices on the menus which always makes me nervous. I will say what we got was worth it. Our total bill was $31 SGD for two plates of fried noodles, one plate of chicken fried rice and three orders of spring rolls with three bottles of water. But this always makes me nervous with no prices. Food was brought out fast and hot. The spring rolls were very good as was the chicken rice. The fried noodles were average. The restaurant was very loud but apparently is a favorite among people as there were no shortage of folks coming the entire time we were there. Foodwise I would consider eating there again. But otherwise, probably not. There are plenty of choices and it would also be okay for a family. To find it, we used google maps which takes you to the intersection of Albert street. The restaurant is up about two storefronts in and not easily seen from the corner so keep this in mind

Acting like a faux colonial in my ridiculous shorts and silly straw hat AND due to my military ancestry I thought we'd make a trip to Singapore. My insufferable wife tagged along to help spend all the inheritance the children think they are getting. The tiny island state itself is clean as expected and the food outlets plentiful with a great amount of choice. With so much to offer I thought I'd try one stand out place. The Wing Seong Fatty's. This place is a cut above the rest, a fine open area to eat and sweat.The other reason for going here with the Trouble and Strife was so I could antagonise her with her gluten and seafood intolerance. I ordered Crab and Squid dishes which I have really never been partial to but just to see her look of disappointment (much like our wedding night) was enough to eat the face of the poor sea creatures sitting sadly on my plate. Still the Mrs got her revenge but referring me as The Fatty at Fatty's and ordering vegetarian dishes like she was Linda McCartney. All in all I thought the food was well made for even me and my conservative commuter belt tastes. Fresh, delivered promptly and with really nice people making sure we were comfortable.One thing to add is the toilets here and elsewhere, they are clean, white and well kept…. Which is the opposite of me and unlike British toilets where drunken revellers always break the seats and treat it like an IRA prison riot. One time I met a friend in soho and the pub toilet was severely kicked in like a Civil rights marcher. It seems the Brit drinkers don't care… I thoroughly recommend Wing Seong Fatty's as they have several options of local fresh dishes and heartily recommend it for anyone who wants to be adventurous. Generally you can’t go wrong anywhere you eat here but this place is a fine start
5
Was looking somewhere close by to our hotel after a long day. Stumbled across the reviews for this place and knew I couldn't leave Singapore without finding out for myself if the food was really that great.I knew straight away that I had found the right place - busy full of expats and locals! We got a seat right away, with beers not far behind. We ordered th spring rolls, chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. The spring roll was pretty good, but I wouldn't go as far as saying they were the best I've ever had (I haven't been to China yet). The sweet and sour chicken was amazing, way better than I expected! The chicken fried rice was simple but perfect. The beer was cheap, I think about $7 for a tallie (the Aussie word for it).This is not a high end restaurant, the plates are plastic and if your sitting outside it is hot but it's all part of the experience in my opinionI would certainly recommend to anyone in the area and I will definitely come back again if I return to Singapore
5
After reading the history of Fatty’s Restaurant (1926-1986)re possible closure due to redevelopment and the outcry of local people to keep the restaurant open, we decided to visit and so glad we did.Don’t be out of by the basic outlay coz the staff are really friendly and helpful and the food was delicious.We had spring rolls, chicken cashew nuts and black pepper chicken (at the recommendation of the waitress) and egg fried rice .... all washed down with xlarge beers (TsingTao) 7sgd.The medium size dishes are good for 2 people to share @ 18sgd.Recommend you visit
5
Recommended by a friend, we enjoyed an early dinner sitting outside. The food was Excellent! In fact the best chinese/Malaysian we've had in a very long time & so good we came back a second time. Black pepper prawns, giant spring rolls just to mention a few - yum. Great value as well
5
What a find this place is
If you love Chinese food give it a go
The beef in a clay pot was delicious
Owner is very friendly and will give you advice and help if required
5
Highly recommended for local food lovers. We usually try to find a place for local food by tripadvisor and this one beat our expectations. We’ve been there twice: both times was as good as expected. Tasty food, friendly staff, quick service. Recommended!
5
I have eaten there many times and the food is always well prepared and reliably good. fuss free service. décor is not inspired but the food is worth coming back to this place for
4
This is how it should be. Sit outside, listen to the bustle and enjoy tasty food. If you're in the area, give it a try, especially the butter prawns :D
5
This is the best place to eat in Singapore. Food is awesome and beer icy cold and reasonably priced. Some of the best dishes are the black pepper prawns, spring rolls and dry chilli chicken. You will not be disappointed having lunch or dinner here.
5
This restaurant has the best Chinese in Singapore. We had 5 different dishes prawns, chicken, beef, rice and kwai teoy and couldn't fault any of them. Seating is indoors and outdoors, but it's that old saying "don't judge a book by its covering" the food was scrumptious. Will definitely return to this restaurant on our next visit
5
Recommend to this restaurant before coming to Singapore. My wife lived in Singapore for six years, never heard of the place. We've been three times on our current holiday, each time brilliant. No pretensions to be other than what it is, an everyday local restaurant. Each visit we've seen more locals than tourists but don't let that put you off. If they run out of tables/chairs they just take another from a stack and squeeze you in.Current "Fatty" is grandson on of the founder and restaurant has been going since 1926 (originally in Albert Street) so they must be doing something right.If you're in Singapore, do yourself a favour and give this place a try
5
I first went to this restaurant in 2011 and have raved about it every since! Everytime I heard someone mention they were going to Singapore I suggested they check the place out.A last minute trip to Singapore earlier this month meant I could try it again and I was slightly worried I had over hyped it to myself... thankfully it didn't dissapoint! Nice casual place, nothing fancy with amazing food and lovely service! Hopefully it won't be as long till I can try it again :
4
Following a Tripadvisor review my wife and I walked up to this restaurant from our hotel and were very pleased that we had made the trip. It was obviously a firm favourite with locals, both Chinese and European. The food was very tasty and promptly served. There is both indoor and outdoor seating available. Staff were kept busy but always ensured that you were looked after. Good range of dishes on the menu. If I lived in Singapore I would visit regularl
5
You must try Fattys! First of all TIGER beer bottle 600 ml is only 7 SGD. After that you have many options of Fried rice, noodles, seafood, beef, pork, chicken, fish, prawn and much more things. I strongly recommend fried rice with seafood or chicken or prawns. Ginger beef and pork ribs are really good. Please do not forget to eat the Spring roll. Come and try. Simple and straight to the point.... your stomach.! Get one outside table and enjoy the atmosphere. If you come to SG you need to visit this place. Liso e Lu do Brasil! :
4
We are regularly dining at this restaurant...nice food.if you want air con for diner then reservation is recommended...one can also sit outside...u can bring your own...beer is available at realistic price for Singapore...
4
Great Food from this Singapore Institution, Dont expect fine dining r even a friendly welcome, go for the food its sensational well priced 'food located close to Bugis Junction. They serve ice cold beer but no wine so take your own
Well recommended
5
3 of us had dinner , very laid back atmosphere , good priced food and nice cold beer!!
Recommend if you are traveling through Singapore
4
Fatty’s is iconic.. a real experience We were told to go early as this little restaurant fills quickly and tables are hard to come by.Fatty is a local, he was friendly and made the effort to come over and meet us and have a chat, then came and say goodbye.The food was delicious and well presented, a must to try!This little restaurant is one of Singapore’s best
4
My favorite- fried noodles That day I was craving for some home cooked fried noodles My friend was in Simlim square and sent me the pics of WSF menu and to my surprise , they have simple fried noodles I have been looking for.The taste is almost the same as home cooked one
4
Stopped here in light of good TA reviews and not disappointed. Not difficult to find we arrived just as it opened so no problem with getting a table. Elected to sit outside in the street on a pleasant,y warm afternoon. Staff very helpful indeed. When it came to ordering we simply took advice from one lady who guided us to something that would suit our tastes. We of course tried the spring rolls which were good but a little bland for my taste. The rest of the food was very good. Beer was 7 singa dollars for a large a Tiger which is good value here. Overall seems a very safe bet for good food at a reasonable price. We paid 50 singa dollars for two if us
3
The Chinese menu had variety and the portions were quite satisfying. The food it self was good without being something exceptional. The place is just another restaurant in mall and the service although quick is not particularly polite or friendly. All in all a descent meal if you are in the area but I would not go twice.
4
Don't go if you want a fancy restaurant ambience as you'll be disappointed by the basic tables and chairs and plastic plates but as others have noted, the food is great and good value for money. We had the sweet and sour chicken and beef with ginger and spring onion, topped off fried rice and large Tsing Tao beer. Place won't break the bank by Singapore standards but will fill your tumm
5
Read a review of this in a paper at home and glad we made the trek.Started ordering and waitress twigged we wanted the "qantas" menu.Some of the best spring rolls Ive had and the black pepper prawns were excellent. Indonesian chicke was also very good
5
In August 2017, my family spent our first evening in this restaurant. Having visited Singapore numerous times this is now a tradition for our first meal. It's as if time has stopped and the quality and taste of each dish is as I remembered it from the last visit. It's very busy try to get there as soon as it opens. It's not classy but that doesn't matter as the attraction is the food.My husband and I always wax lyrical to other people about Fatty's and it plays an important part in our enjoyment of the whole visit. Long may it continue
4
The food is nice but be prepared to wait. I went on Sunday evening for dinner. Despite having made reservations and was there on time, we waited for nearly 30mins before the first dish was served.
3
The looks of the dishes are tempting. However, the taste is average and compared to the total price, it is not meeting my expectation.
Simply overrated.
5
My husband and I ate here on the first night of our stay in Singapore. I don't eat meat and he is fussy with his vegetables; we both found something we liked and we both absolutely LOVED our food. The beer wasn't too badly priced either. It was quite busy with some tourists and also quite a lot of locals but we got a table quickly! Service was good too!!Really loved it here
4
After reading other reviews of Fatty's, we visited on a Sunday evening. Whilst it was crowded, the service was fast and friendly, although our order was mixed up. It didn't matter too much because the good was very tasty and at a very reasonable price. The legendary Spring Rolls were not worth the hype, but the cold beer was good
5
An iconic local restaurant that I have been using for many years. Food is fantastic and they have the best "spring rolls' I have ever tasted. Don't let the surroundings put you off as I am sure a great meal and ice cold beer awaits those who give it a go
4
Don't expect plush surroundings or city views but it is worth a visit for the excellent food and cold beers that will not have a huge impact on your bank balance. You can choose to sit inside or outdoors where you will get the same prompt attention and service. Make sure you try the spring rolls, they are delicious and big, so one each will be sufficient.
5
The restaurant is not fancy at all. It's a very old fashioned simply delicious food type. The service was very fast, the food was delicious and the beer was cold. Petri and I thoroughly enjoyed our time there. I would highly recommend the place if you are looking for a local experience rather than a high end hotel type restaurant experience
5
A Singapore icon. Great atmosphere, great food and great service. Very easy to settle in with a beer, they are always 'ice cold'.The Spring Rolls are a treat, and the menu is comprehensive so all tastes catered for.Great Singapore dining, and at a reasonable price. Shopping for electronics is on the door step at Sim Lim Plaza
4
Great place that offers either the option to eat in or outside. The good is consistently good. We tried the fried rice and spring rolls for the first time and liked both items. The scallops and broccoli also were good. It's a place to go with just about anyone
3
Fatty's used to be a regular food stop when we lived in Singapore with Fatty serving up typical hawker-style food with a flourish. Unfortunately Fatty has passed on and his place taken by his son Skinny.Sadly the days when you had to wait to get a table have gone and the sight of empty tables on a Saturday night says a lot about the current popularity of the restaurant.The spring rolls are still good but the chilli crab something of a let down. Local crabs just don't seem to stack up against those from Sri Lanka.Happily the price of beer is still low by local standards which helps with the bill.With an array of six good-sized dishes and four bottles of Anchor (there were four of us) $35 a head was reasonable for an acceptable though a less than outstanding meal
5
Fatty's is simple, consistent and well priced. We always go by when in Singapore and we are never disappointed
5
We nearly always eat here because the food is amazing.
It's close to the hotel we stay in (Village Hotel Albert Court)
5
A good selection on the menu, all at reasonable prices and excellent! There is inside and outside dining, there was a mixture of locals and tourists, the restaurant is also popular with flight crews. We loved it.
5
Hadn't been for some years. Still the same high standard food. Spring rolls, black pepper prawns, special rice, nuclear chicken with a cold beer A must do.
3
Ate here as I read the reviews and was in a nearby hotel. Wouldn't say it was anything better than average. Black pepper prawns were chewy although the sauce was good. Spring roll was average. Chicken fried rice also average. Could see what all the fuss was about to be honest....
5
I've been going for 30 years. Everytime I'm in Singapore I have one Meal here. The service is functionary , the food amazing and Tsing Tao cold. Fresh Lime juice is wonderful if abstaining. Order the incredible spring rolls, they are large, one each, dip them in Chilli or soy sauce and must have with the mild cut green peppers. Superb Pepper prawns, the small size option is enough for one or two people. Cheaper is the pepper chicken option. Bbq pork is great and the garlic baby kai lan or seasonal green leaf substitute is amazing. Chicken hotpot is spicy and terrific drizzled over rice.Mid range price , definitely not hawker prices but always best of flavours
4
This restaurant takes away the faff and pretentiousness and serves good, traditional Chinese food. Sitting outside on garden chairs with plastic tables and large bottles of beer you get good value for money and good food. It is out of the CBD and the prices reflect this. Definitely worth a visit
5
I have been visiting Fatty's on and off since 2002. I took my fiancé there after talking it up our entire holiday. The beer is cold, the food is quick and delicious. More importantly the food is cheap for Singapore standards. We even ended up having a second dinner there as we were up walking through the markets. We ate the sweet and sour pork, blackPepper chicken, chicken hot pot and spring roll. Only downside, the angry old duck who greeted us. Must hate her job cause she was rude the entire time and incredibly rude to her staff.
5
I have been here with my husband on a number of occasions but this time we took one of our sons with us. The spring rolls are just the best. If you visit you have to have at least one each. I had black pepper beef and the men had nuclear chicken and a pork dish with fried rice. A couple of chinese beers to cool off in the heat and a fantastic meal to start our holida
3
Stopped by Wing Seong Fatty for dinner to see what's the hype about. We stood around awkwardly for a few minutes before finally ushered in by a friendly middle aged waiter. The others were rather busy and walked past us without any intention to serve us, we almost walked away because of that. We picked the recommended dishes — black pepper prawns, spring roll, fried rice and omelette. The food came really quickly and all of them were piping hot. The taste of the food was okay, it's quite the average/normal zi char standard. The total bill came to be $50 and as we left we noticed many foreigners and tourists in the restaurant. To be honest, there are much tastier zi char restaurants in Singapore but if you're in the area and happened to be strongly craving for zi char, then I guess you can stop by Wing Seong Fatty to satisfy you :
4
Great food and reasonable price. Best to make a reservation first. Popular with locals and foreigners.
4
This place had been recommended to me. They have in and outside seating and a nice selection. I knew I wanted the shrimp and they did not disappoint.
5
A place with very good food with reasonable prices. You can order without the list. Say what you want and it will be fixed.
5
Really nice area with well fanned outside area, families of both expats and Singaporeans are here eating most nights and you can see why. Delicious food. Reasonable prices.
Recommend.
5
Great value and it's a landmark in Singapore . Fun atmosphere
Something for everyone in the menu
Food is fresh and reasonable price !
The owner and staff are wonderful
4
Have visited this restaurant numerous times on business trips to Singapore and never disappointed. The food is excellent and varied. Service is very good and staff are a joy, can't wait for next visit
5
As travellers who like to avoid the tourist areas, we decided to try Wing Seong Fattys based on the reviews. We read in Trip Advisor.Certainly not disappointed!This restaurant is a very busy family affair with a mix of travellers and locals. Efficient service, hot, fresh food which was delicious and reasonably priced.Highly recommend this restaurant as an authentic, no frills Chinese/Singaporean restaurant
5
You wouldn't come here unless somebody told you to - there's nothing fancy about it but the food is great and reasonably priced. Sit outside and people watch or inside in the air conditioning with the cheapest beer we found in Singapore ($7 for a large Tsing Tao). Dish recommendations include BBQ pork, clay pot chicken or beef and vegetable kang kong. We ate and drank until we were uncomfortably full and only paid $30-35 per head
5
I have visited this restaurant many times over the past 30 years and I have always had fantastic food. Whether in large groups of ten or more, or as a couple the food is excellent & very reasonably priced for Singapore.I would suggest you only order small size dishes as with Spring rolls to start & by adding fried rice to your mains there is always too much food!
5
Went around 7.30pm with 15 work colleagues and got seated immediately. You can sit indoors or outside. The service is polite and efficient and there is a very wide range of Chinese dishes. They do excellent seafood, especially the salt and pepper squid which comes in a tasty batter. You can order dishes in various portion sizes. If you follow the Chinese way of ordering one dish per person plus rice or noodles, the small size is plenty. Noodle and rice portions are very generous. Or you can ask your server for advice. There are the standards like sweet and sour pork and excellent spring rolls or you can be more adventurous and try their tofu in sauce, scallops or crab dishes. And try the local Tiger beer. The prices are very fair for the quality and freshness of the food. Location is near LaSalle College of the Arts and 5 minutes walk from Hotel Ibis Bencoolen and nearest metro is Rochor. There is also a gigantic computer and electronics mall just opposite if you want to indulge your inner geek.
5
Reasonable pricing Chinese food
We ordered 3 dishes and all in small size
But that's really enough for 2 person
Suggest to all budgeted travellers!
5
Great meal here with good friends recently. Though a Chinese restaurant, it has many local specialties - the curry chicken was an absolute standout with a delicious gravy. Vegetarian dishes were also superb, in particular a sambal kang kong. I will be coming back!
4
I usually go for the food courts to get a selection of dishes and to experience the local atmosphere, however, Fatty's is a great place to go to if you need to dine a little later.
5
We all know that Singapore can be pricey when eating out but just a short taxi ride from Raffles brings you to Chinatown & it's fabulous hawker centres. We stumbled acrid Wing Seong Fattys by chance (although I had previously read great reviews on this establishment & was keen to try it out)We ordered the half duck which was carved & wrapped in pancakes also stuffed with cucumber, spring onion & hoisin at our table, the remainder being stir fried with garlic & chilli to accompany the fabulous yung chow fried rice & prawn rolls we also ordered. Together with two large bottles of tiger beer & our bill came to around Â£45 & was worth every penny. Yes they charge you for the bowl of 'Bombay mix' that is placed on the table when you arrive & also for the cold towels but the pros of the great food & good service far outweighs being charged pocket change for nuts & towels
5
First went when they were in Albert Street and was so pleased to revisit them at Burlinton. Arrived very late and was informed that the chili crab was "out of stock" (not surprising on a Friday night). Manager asked us to have a beer and wait couple of minutes, returned promptly and apologized that he only had two small crabs he could offer, we jumped at the chance (Small = young= sweet). Superb with sides of veg.My mate, an American experienced traveller, deemed it the best meal he had ever eaten. Praise indeed
5
We recently had a lunch and a dinner at Fattys. As far as food quality goes, the Fat Man delivers. Highly recommend the clay pot (Indonesian style) chicken or seafood. Lovely flavours, we mopped up every drop of sauce. Vegetable Kang Kong also delicious if you like a little spice. Beers nice and cold, food & beers well priced. Can choose dishes small, medium or large which we found very practical. As a couple three small dishes were perfect with a small rice. We will definitely visit again when in Singapore
4
I read some reviews and we decided to try this restaurant after work on a Tuesday. We got a table outside and ordered just the chili crab and veggie. It was very delicious and we could not have asked for anything more. Next time we will try the other dishes and hope that they are as good as the chili crab
4
This restaurant is strictly no frills but the food is excellent and really cheap. The staff are friendly and helpful. We were recommended to eat there and I was a bit disappointed when I first saw it. Don't be put off by its appearance. Food more than makes up for it
4
Here you can have a good chinese dinner. Restaurant is a little busy but this is rather charming. You can enjoy the atmosphere of the chinese cooking. Very fast service and nice variety of dishes, also some less common.And a nice big bottle of Tiger beer.Recommended
5
Fattys is a Singaporean institution, always pay a visit when passing through Singapore. Clay pot chicken, salt & pepper prawns, fried rice, spring rolls & pak choy, usually with a cold Tiger beer, all for approx S$40 per head. Now being run by Skinny, one of Fatties sons. Fatty used to take left overs to the prisoners of war held in nearby camps, he'd pass the food through the fence, a local hero
4
You wouldn't eat here unless someone recommended it to you as in appearance it does look rough and ready however the food is incredible ! It's the best Chinese/local food I've had and also great value for money.
5
This was a very enjoyable evening of fine Chinese cuisine. The roasted pork, duck and Mongolian lamb were all top notch. We sat outside and really enjoyed the ambiance of the street culture. I want to complement the wait staff who were very attentive and made sure that we were well looked after. We drank lemon tea which was also very refreshing and complimentary to the meal. This is a muat attend restaurant when in Singapore.

Looking at all the good review of the restaurant and plus the fact that this is my foreign colleagues' strongly-recommended place, I almost feel sorry to say that I don't like it at all -- and I am local Chinese! But I really fail to see why it is so popular among foreigners. We had our company dinner there so we got to try a lot of the food. Fried rice: plain -- not that there wasn't enough soy sauce but that is all you can taste in the rice, not a lot of other ingredients can be found in the fried rice and they surely don't make any differences in flavor. Spring rolls: were freshly fried and crispy but meat were dry inside and also lack of taste. Black-pepper beef with onions: the beef were tough... Randang beef/chicken curry: basically the same taste and I can taste the chicken was not fresh chicken -- like being frozen for some time because with the curry I can still taste that it is tough and the fridge smell... We ordered at least 10 dishes and I cannot even pick 1 out to say that was my favourite because they basically all taste the same and I might get better dishes from hawker centre. I think maybe the understanding of good Chinese food is just different between the westerners and Chinese... Or maybe I am just a Cantonese who is very picky about my food..

one of the best meals and very inexpensive, plenty of atmosphere and the staff extremely helpful in explaining the dishes etc. $S50 will buy you a great meal for two including beer or soft drinks. only a 15-20 minute walk from Raffles and easy to get to, same menu for lunch and dinne

We decided to visit here after seeing the good Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. We were seated immediately, atmosphere was good, the staff helped us choose what to order and when the food came..... it was so delicious! We ordered the Black Pepper beef and the Indonesian Chicken with Rice and Spring Rolls. The food came quickly and it was so tasty. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that would listen!!
5
Not to be missed! Great food & fair prices. Excellent!Even better if you like 'Tiger' Beer Clay pot Chicken Curry & Peppered prawns would be the two dishes not to be missed.Don't be put off by the plastic plates. This wee gem is a must visit while in Singapore

I used to live in Singapore and would eat here when visitors came to stay. I always thought there was some connection between Auastaloan soldiers and Fatty's but can't find any information about this. The food is always good. This time We had fried vegetables with oyster sauce (it was kailan) and beef with black bean. Beef and black bean is not on the menu so we were really happy when they could make it for us. Everything we had was great
4
Casual, very reasonable prices and if you choose, classic Aussie Chinese food like you get at home and can't get in most restaurants.V fun place and local part from eating beef and black bean sauce and sweet and sour pork Sydney style !BYO if you like and they don't charge !Enjoy )
5
My husband had eaten at a Fatty's restaurant when he visited Singapore in 1968 so we were delighted to discover ( on Tripadvisor!) that the original Fatty's grandson had started his own restaurant. We arrived just as the kitchen was closing but Fatty junior insisted we sit down and order whatever we wanted. His suggestion of pork belly in ginger was delicious. We soon forgot the unprepossessing plastic table and chairs and tucked in. Check out the photos of the original Fatty proudly displayed on the restaurant walls
5
Just had 4 nights in Singapore and stumbled across Fatty's on way back from the train station - so glad we did. The restaurant was booked out that night so we arranged a table for the following night. Wow, the food was so fresh and yummy. The kids loved the fried rice and sweet and sour chicken, adults loved everything. Enjoyed it so much we went back again the following night. Price was great $95.00 for 4 Adults and 2 kids
5
We met some family at this restaurant and my parters first asian outside plastic table and chair experience. The food was superb, we also talked to Skinny, the owner, son of Fatty. The whole evening was great, fab food and well worth the visit.
4
Best chili crab in town, not to expensive like other place. Nice food, has indoor n outdoor sitting area. But not too friendly staffs
3
Not sure what am the fuss is about. Solid Singaporean Chinese food but not anything out of the ordinary. Seems to have storied history and so on but foodwise middling to slightly above average.
4
We arrived with 16 and were happy to leave the ordering up to the staff and they did not disappoint. Sensational pepper beef, greens with garlic, roast duck and satay prawns....absolute taste sensation. The orange plastic bowls and spoons just added to the enjoyment. Spectacular.
5
Or friend goes to Singapore on business, so knows this one quite well, Im not a big fan of Chinese food but this was different. The food was excellent, really was, we just got 5 dishes for 6 people, some rice and waded in. The food just kept on coming, very tasty and cheap. Then I get my record shop round the corner.Lovely
4
Fatty's was recommended by a local so me and my friend went to try it. We were not disappointed at all. In fact, we were satisfied with their authentic chinese style dishes. The service was fast. The dishes were affordable. We ordered 2 huge spring rolls( the biggest I've ever seen), prawns, clams with vegetables and fried rice. The ambiance is typical of a chinese restaurant. They use melamine plates which for me is not cool. . They accepted mastercard which is a plus factor. I'll definitely come back for the food.
4
Really tasty Singaporean Chinese cuisine.Its a cafe style atmosphere - indoor and outdoor seating. Laminex tables and lots of tiles. So if you want linen table cloths, and silver service ... try somewhere else.For my wife and I, it was perfect - great food at bargain prices and close to the MRT
4
Just reach here so hungry , searching for the local food nearby. Wing Seong Fatty's is popped up. Visit there, food is so tasty , hot and fast service. Very good all the food and reasonable price. Clear for the menu , you can select for the portion as well.
5
~off the main road just opposite Sim Lim Square Wing Seong Fatty's is another legendary Fatty of Singapore!~we'd a gathering of past colleagues and the food never fails to live up to great "zi char" plus their Chicken/Duck at night carvery ala Chinese butchering still hanging off the hooksI'd ordered the super yummy Black Pepper Chicken (actually all their meat items are yummy)if you're ever in this part of town it's a good reasonable priced restaurant reminiscent of a home made age of cooking :
5
My family and I have been eating at Fatty's as and whenever we are around in Bugis. We really love to eat the restaurant because all the dishes truly represent all our local Chinese authentic food. The restaurant is clean and tidy and the seats are spacious and it is usually for family and friends' gatherings.Our favourite dishes are Black Pepper Beef and Sweet and Sour Pork. The meat is always tender and sweetness and sourness of the pork is absolutely perfect
5
Love this place. Great food, fast service, good price. Visit here every visit to Singapore! Good location, visit Bugis markers and shops then head for a feed!
4
My partner and I had dinner at the restaurant is just a short walk from our hotel. The food was served relatively fast. My favourite was the clay pot chicken.
5
Everything I tried here was delicious, favourite being the black pepper prawn! Service was great, was busy but got a table inside. Walked out completely full & satisfied :)
3
This restaurant has a long history passing from one generation to another.
Typical good food served Singaporean way.
My only minus for this place is I find the dishes more heavy handed- that is more oil, salt and MSG.
2
I've visited Fatty's regularly since 6-7 years. It used to be quite good, but I really don't know if I will dine there ever again. Our last experience was anything but good and really disappointing; Dishes lacked taste (except prawns with black pepper that tasted only black pepper...) and were covered with generic greylike starch-sauce, they have become smaller and more expensive. Price-quality -ratio was really bad. Sad, because I really liked Fatty's.
5
Wonderful meal, cheap beer, friendly service. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We would have over ordered had the waitress not told us that it would have been too much. Fabulous pepper prawns, best spring rolls & sweet & sour pork. The bill was $62 for the two of us, absolute bargain. Thank you
5
There is a good reason why this place is aaaaalways crowded!!! The food is super good... the list of dishes we tried and were super yummy is too long! The service is always quick so you can count on food making its way to you shortly after you order. Also fun that if you accept the offer they sometimes seat you at shared tables outside and we met everytime really fun people!
4
I turned up alone on a busy evening and shared a table. My dinner companions shared our individually ordered dishes, once we became acquainted and had a very pleasant time making friends.Fatty's service attention fostered the community dining ambience and I enjoyed meeting unexpected new acquaintances over dinner at Fatty's. It was a coincidence that one of the guy's I met had been coming to Fatty's since he was a kid with his parents. It's that sort of place. I shall return........
5
Every time I go to Singapore I make sure I eat here at least twice... once to remind myself that yes this place is awesome, and then cos I just cannot resist. Get the sweet and sour fish OMG amazing, and the spring rolls (huge so 1 each
5
Back in Singapore again. I never miss a chance to visit Wing Seong Fatty's (just Fatty's to locals). I've ordered many dishes but I always get the Mongolian Prawns and the Black Pepper Beef and make sure and get a lime juice! Other favorites of mine are the spring roll, clay pot curry chicken, and any fried rice. The staff is friendly, attentive and willing to suggest. Don't average down by going to a China Town disappointment. Instead go to Sim Lim square and find Fatty's where tradition and great food has survived for decades. Your mouth and your stomach thank you in advance.
5
We went for dinner last night and we're not disappointed! Simple menu- BIG flavor. It seems to be a family run business, and had a great vibe. Do not miss the sweet and sour pork, and the Black Paper prawns! Reasonable prices for Singapore!
5
We tried this after reading reviews on Trip Advisor.
Well it was worth it. Really good food and very cheap by singapore standards.
Not the best decor but then the food made up for it.
Lots of locals eating there.
Would recommend
5
Went here for the first time on this visit after recommendations from several people and were not disappointed. Excellent food, excellent value. A no frills place, speedy friendly service. Will definitely be back.
5
Been patronizing this restaurant since I was a kid. Love the homely feel, some of the old staff still working there.
Like their sweet sour pork, horfun & spring roll
5
Great food, we loved all of it. The staff were so very friendly and helpful, especially as we're not the easiest of customers with a baby. We are very grateful. Price reasonable also. Wasn't a table to be had when left, so must be popular.
4
8 of us showed up without a reservation and they fit us in after just a few minutes wait. The service was excellent and friendly - quickly moving chairs and arranging for us. The beer was cold (enough) and brought out right away. We ordered a range of dishes to pass around - the prawns were delicious as were the vegetables. The rice with chicken was average and I didn't try the beef w/ noodles. The total cost was under $200 for the whole group ($25 each including beer) and we were happy with that
5
We've been visiting this family-run restaurant as long as we can remember, including when we lived in Singapore. We went back recently after some years away to find the same unpretentious setting, excellent home cooked food and accommodating staff. Most of all, we were pleased to make acquaintance with 'Fatty' and Amy again. Glad that some things in Singapore stay the same
4
Went for lunch with a group of colleagues for CNY louhei. The service was fast and the servers were friendly and attentive. I would recommend calling to reserve a table on special occasions. While the restaurant was packed and there are patrons waiting outside, we were not rushed to finish our meal. Don't expect fine dining and nice plating, come for the home cooked style food. The seasoning is good not too salty and not too spicy. I would recommend the sambal kangkong, fried chicken, roast pork belly which is crispy and don't have an oily after taste and the steam fish. Overall a very pleasant and satisfying experience. Directions to reach there. Take the MRT to Rochor station. From the control station turn right, walk till u see a long escalator. Take the escalators up till u reach the street level. From the street level, turn right and right again almost immediately and follow a short flight of stairs down to the road behind the station. From where u stand u can see Burlington square. Cross the road and with Burlington square signboard on your right. Walk down the lane and u should see the restaurant on your right. It is approx the 3rd or 4th shop from the right. Enjoy!
5
Each time we come to Singapore we come here. It is not flash but the food is great authentic and tasty. Sit outside and you can watch Singapore in action.We had sweet sour pork $12 and Beef with black bean pepper $12. Tiger beer is a good price @ $7.50 for the large bottleIt is easy to find in the Burlington Mall and there is a great multi-level electronics mall opposite which is worth a look as well.Highly recommende
5
We live round the corner and we're first introduced to Fattys by a neighbour, early last year.We have lived in Asia for 5 years now, the one thing we love is sweet and sour pork, and boy does this place do a mean one!Our son, having been born in Asia is a big fan of rice, and he does serious damage to a portion of chicken fried rice.The spring roles are always so fresh and full of flavour.Service is always speedy.Not to be missed and the fact they do takeaway is a bonus to
4
Good food and service. The salted egg prawn was very scrummy. We also tried the pork ribs which were good also. Ambience leaves a little to be desired but not too bad. Overall a nice restaurant experience for authentic chinese food.
5
This is a basic Chinese restaurant but frequented by many expats and tourists. Has an outside area and is behind SIM LIM Square (electronics mall). The staff remember their repeat guests and prices are fair. Food always really good. Highly recommended
5
I was first time in Fattys for 30 years ago and have been there many times nerly every year.
Every time we/ I am in Singapore we are eating there, try it you won't regret it
5
We had great food especially the chicken in Indonesian style... The staff was very kind and helpful...We will definitely go there again😊
4
The restaurant offered good value for Singapore prices; Convenient location, close to many shopping areas
5
Fatties is a fun and noisy place to eat. A bit dearer than street food it's still great value. Loved every rush we ordered " not spicey" and were well looked after by our waitress. Definitely not fine dining but fresh, tasty and ample serves.
4
The chilie crab was just the best. Bit expensive compared to some of the hawkers outlets but the chilli was just how i remembered it from 20 years ago. The service was great and the portions were very satisfying.
5
This is a favourite whenever we visit Singapore. It is casual dining and we love to watch the world go by sitting outside although they also have a large indoor air conditioned area. The food is amazing and very good value. The black pepper prawns are to die for! Staff are super friendly and will help you order. Food comes quickly and is high quality
5
We let the lovely bald (bigger) gentleman pick our dishes and it was brilliant. I asked for no spicy, 1 chicken 1 beef 1 veggie, he serves us chicken ginger, mongolian(?) beef, and some beansprout & green veggie. Food is great, 2 dishes with rice enough for 2 people, 3 dishes without rice for 2 people. Place is clean, comfy, full AC, in a good neighborhood near malls.
4
With so many restaurants to chose from it was great to find this place recommended and it lived up to expectations. Ate there twice whilst staying in Singapore as it was so good the first time we went and with such an extensive menu it was good to revisit. Particularly recommend the Indonesia style chicken
4
Nice spring roll, soups and roasted pork are the best!
Have been eating there for years and still love their food ;)
5
We took the internet's advice and ate at this restaurant and we weren't disappointed! The food was great chinese with clay pot beef a knockout. Skinny called a taxi and personally took us to it!
4
We ate at Fatty's three times during a recent visit to Singapore. The food was great - I specially recommend the chicken hot pot spicy, though even a small is generous. The service was fast, efficient and always cheerful.
4
We went here on our final night in Singapore and were not disappointed! The food was delicious and the experience made us feel like locals. Service is exceptional and the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly.
4
We were recommended Fatties whilst still in Australia and they were right on the money!It's a simple mixture of great service, great food and a good location. I always love an Asian restaurant that focusses on food and service rather than decor!Old mate was our waiter, was very attentive and great at recommendations.We had the special recommended to us, and feasted on pepper prawns, Indonesian (volcano) chicken, fried rice and spring rolls.The food was great, old mate made sure we knew which sauce went with which dish, and that we had enough beer to cool the heat
5
One of Singapore's more well-known food havens, this is situated inside and outside the ground floor of the Burlington Arcade, near Rochor Canal Rd and Bugis marketplace. Frequented by major international aircrews (who generally know where the best value eats are), this supplies a lovely, mainly wok-driven menu and consistently nice tasty food at rather inexpensive prices for its situation. Sit outside under the archway for atmosphere and watch the very efficient and nice family-run service. Want a good feed? Try the beef in ginger and shallots, with a side of rice and stir-fried pak choy. With a large Tsingtao or Tiger beer. Delicious and filling, every time!
5
Amazing simple food - so flavorful and expertly made!! We had the chicken fried rice, bbq pork, ginger beef and chicken noodles and it was all delicious beyond words. We only had two nights in Singapore but chose to come back here on the second (even after walking around the whole foodcourt at the Marina Bay Sands trying to find something inspirational to eat!). This place is excellent and we WILL be back. Oh and the service is great as well!! Do your belly a favor and just go!
2
Visited here after glowing recommendations by a friend who ate here on holiday. Won't bother with any more of their recommendations after this!Located next to Sim Lim square, so location seemed a bit odd, but easy to find. Disappointing when we found it as nothing special or authentic at all. It was full of tourists and expats, so not a good sign.Service quick if unfriendly, and drinks served quickly. Food however was very poor. All very greasy and not particularly tasty. No atmosphere in the restaurant or outside, and although we expected the basic facilities, and 'street' style Chinese food from an old established Singapore restaurant, it was really disappointing and I failed to understand the rave reviews. Not sure what we missed...worse than any hawker centre I have tried in Singapore.There are much better options in Singapore. A walk around Chinatown alone will yield much better food, more 'authenticity', and cost less
4
This restaurant used to be located at the Albert Street (>20 years old), where the current Albert Court Hotel sited, remembering the old days that their business was very good, buses of tourists were there every night.It has been years that I have visited them. Was there 2 nights ago with my family.We ordered the "basic" dishes, such as Bee Hoon (Dry and Wet), Sweet Pork Rib, and veg.Although these are not anything special to lots of people, but I can still taste the "vintage" flavor, this restaurant is housed with warmth, they have few staffs that were working there for decades.This has been a very popular place to tourists, not surprising to see lots of smiling faces, a good restaurant to visit
5
We were staying in the apartments above this restaurant (Burlington Square) and therefore ate here a few times during our stay. The food was consistently good. We particularly liked the pepper prawns, the chicken clay pot (spicy) and the roast pork. The kids absolutely loved the pork spare ribs. Friendly, prompt service, and reasonable prices added to the general happiness. They were also happy for us to purchase a fanta from the shop next door for my son, as it wasn't on their menu, which I thought was nice
5
went to fatty's twice with friends while we were in singapore,the food is cheap and fantastic,service is quick even though its always busy.tables and chairs are plastic as is the plates but if you want great food,friendly atmosphere....its here at fatty's.
ken
4
Its the best local chinese dish in singapore.. price is reasonable. A must try is the beef hotpot... its the best...
4
Lunch here was a treat -- excellent Chinese food, freshly prepared and with helpful service. We were advised by the waiter to order the small servings -- and they were generous sized. Clean European style toilets are a bonus.
5
We had to wait just a view minutes to get a table. The food was very good quality and freshly prepared.
4
Went to Fatty's last time we were in Singapore five years ago and again tonight and nothing has changed. The food is sensational, staff are very helpful and you feel like one of the locals. Highly recommended for excellent food at a good price.
5
Just awesome the least to say.. Chicken so hot a pepper would cry. All one needs for a fair price . you won't be disappointed in Anny of this kitchens output.

We were staying in the Bugis area for just one night and were looking to TripAdvisor to give us a good eating (note not necessarily a dining experience). The reviews for Wing Seong are mostly glowing in terms of the flavour of the food so we gave it a go.There were no seats outside available so we were ushered through to an inside table in the corner. Ambience there was zero, only plus was the air conditioning. The interior is similar to one of the less salubrious Melbourne Chinatown, ie pretty ordinary and this should have been a hint to the quality of food to come.The menu is quite extensive, from crab, to deer, frog legs to all the usual Cantonese style dishes. We decided to over order and try a range of dishes. We were very quickly served, ice cold Tsingtao was also appreciated.We tried mostly small dishes - and if you are eating as a couple it is the way to go, as the small serves are a good size. Though not cheap the price seem to be fair.We liked two of our dishes a lot. The pepper prawns were full of papery flavour with six large shelled prawn tails, almost delicious. The pork ribs were also very good, not special, but again very tasty and a good siz e serving for the price. The fried rice with shrimp was a competent fried rice and again cheap. Had an egg dish, which was ok, can't remember the version, The fried frog legs came sans sauce. A half dozen legs served hot but were unrecognisable as frog legs. Simply deep fried, A poor choice. We had a 1/4 BBQ duck, served sliced of the bone. Had better in dirt cheap Tasmanian restaurants, so that means it was underwhelming to say the least! So overall very disappointed. Had better meals in Tasmanian Chinese restaurants! And that is not a compliment to Tasmanian Chinese restaurants
5
We paid a visit to this restaurant after reading other positive feedback on tripadvisor... Well, we are all satisfied with the food they cook! My friend and I went there in the evening, just 1 hour before the restaurant was about to close, but the waiter (seems to be the family member of the owner), still welcomed us warmly. We ordered 4 dishes: steam beef and pork clear soup, sweet and sour pork, fish fillet, and asparagus with garlic. All tasted goood. I was not particularly hungry when accompanying my friend having dinner there, but then could not resist to keep on digging the food into my mouth. Their food is well cooked and seasoned. You know what, it took us less than USD 50 for all the dishes we ordered. Definetely worth visiting, and would love to come back.
5
Wanting a genuine Singapore outdoor seated experience and we weren't disappointed. Service was quick and efficient and the food delicious. The first night we over ordered so when we returned we were careful. The small portions were generous enough. Especially enjoyed the sweet and sour pork and the Yeong Chow fried rice was perfect. Will go again on our next visit
5
We stayed in a hotel near by and popped in for dinner due to the generous outdoor seating. We were quite hungry and ordered some dishes to share in medium size. The waitress immediately advised us, that she thought it would be better to order small sizes, as the portions are quite generous, which we found very fair. Each dish tasted very nice and had its individual, special flavour. Service was very attentive and when we paid our bill we were pleasantly surprised. As a result we were back the next day.
5
We lived in Singapore for 7 years and visited at least two times a month. Never disappointed, most of the times delighted. Sit outside and don't miss the salted prawns or dried chili chicken!
5
We found this restaurant becausevwas close to our hotel and wevdecide to give a try. Yummy food at good price
5
Amazing food with a great mix of locals and expats!!!! Especially love the clay pot chicken, and the spring rolls are to die for!!! Great for casual meals with friends and family
5
Fresh seafood and cheap tiger beer makes this place a treasure to visit in what can be an expensive city to visit. Quick no fuss service and great location for people watching while you dine.
4
Went there for a quick family dinner after shopping at Sim Lim, not expecting much. FromThe outside, the place looks quite run of the mill and even a little jaded. But the Beef Hor Fun which came out first was full of flavour and Wok Hei, beef was velveted in the typical Chinese style and was tender. The sweet and sour pork was not the usual cloyingly sweet version served elsewhere so often. It came to the table still crispy and with a well fried crunchy battter. Service is abrupt but efficient.
5
This restaurant is worth searching out. It came recommended by a friend who is aircrew and has been gooding there for years. It's near Sim Lim square and very well known to locals and taxi drivers. It's basic in appearance but has so much character. Fatty , the original owner has since passed away , and his son 'Skinny ' now runs it. He and his staff are the most efficient people but have a 'brisk manner ' which just adds to the experience. No smiles or chit chat, just honest quick service and the best food ever. We had sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, spare ribs (which were fantastic) and black pepper beef. All served within 5 minutes of ordering and all piping hot. Beer is on the menu and if you want wine,go to the shop next door and they will even give you wine glasses to use. It's an experience I'd highly recommend when staying in Singapore. I'd certainly return. Wonderful food !!!!!
5
The food here is great & not badly priced. The service is not 100% as the people come across a little abrupt but don't let it put you off as they're actually very nice. Would recommend the chicken noodles, Indonesian clay pot chicken & sweet & sour pork.
5
This place has super friendly staff who are prompt and helpful. We had 4 dishes including two chicken dishes, rice and noodles, spring roll and a beer and a coke for $50 The food was really tasty and there were plenty of locals eating there too. Highly recommended
5
This food is one of the best I had in singapore. The restaurant looks wery basic, but the food is wery good. Especially the sweet and sour fish and the pepper beef! Sit down in the street, buy a big bootle of tsingtao andenjoy your food! As an ekstra entertainment you can watch all the funny toys that the guy in the RC shop nerby is demonstrating!
5
I have being going to this restaurant since 1988. It is great, food always the same, similar price every time. I asked for something that was not on the menu, steamed fish with ginger and it was delicious. Skinny does not smile but he was lovely at sorting this for me and checked to make sure I liked it. It is a casual restaurant and food served in melamine plates. There is a plaque regarding the history of the family restaurant inside and when you read it you will realise why a lot of people visit!
3
Ok , not exceptional but have had worse. Pork spare ribs tasty, but the meat spring roll was too much. I think i am use to mostly vegetarian spring rolls. Cold beer
5
Fresh food and great value for your money. Loved green vegetables and chicken hot pot.
Highly recommend.
4
We found Fatty's after strolling the streets and Alleys of Chinatown. We got a table outside to absorb the atmosphere and were given great service by the staff. The kids loved their lime juices, lemon chicken and noodles with seafood. I had the famous Singapore chili crab which was on my 'must do' list. Messy, hard work and expensive, but definitely worth doing at least once if you like seafood.
3
Dropped in during a visit, as I had eaten here before when working in Singapore. The beer is still cheap, but whilst the food was ok and filled an empty stomach, it seemed to have lost the taste and service it once had. The prices seem to have gone up while the quality and portion size has decreased. If you want much cheaper and tastier food, head to People's Park food court in Chinatown, then compare
2
My wife and I visited this place based on the strong reviews from TripAdvisor earlier this month. We were expecting good Chinese food at a good value. It turned out to be way over priced Chinese food that was a step above food court Chinese food. This is an expat hangout for people willing to pay for overpriced meals like an expat. This is not a local favorite. Definitely disappointed in the TripAdvisor reviews we had read. After spending a month here and taking many locals' recommendations with whom I worked, I highly recommend either Zam Zam for the best murtabak in Singapore if you're looking for an inexpensive, authentic local place to eat. If you're looking for high quality Chinese food, try Long Beach or another similar restaurant that serves chili crab
1
I've lost confidence in Trip Advisor reviews after visiting Wing Seong with my wife last night. The reviews gave it glowing reports but the realty was quite different. The 'legendary' fried rice was possibly the worst we've eaten as was the garlic prawns, spring rolls and Singapore Chicken. At least the beer was cold and it wasn't expensive but we'd never do it again even if it was free.So I assume most of the earlier reviewers haven't eaten Decent Cantonese food before
3
Having read some (mixed) reviews on this site opted for Fatty's. It was busy but got a table in the street. I was expecting the menu to offer things out of the ordinary but looked fairly so-so to me. Ordered my meal with rice and a beer. Beer turned up followed quickly by the plate of rice. Decided to tuck into this before it got cold. 5 minutes later the main course arrived. Some disconnect here with the service. Food was tasty but waitress had used up all her smiles and customer focus on others. Price was OK but more than I was expecting
2
Haven't been here for a Long Long time.Ownership has changed because Skinny won't let my Husband call him 'Boss' anymore.Corn & pork soup - nice, meat tenderSweet & sour pork - not crispy. Used to be very good. Not worth eating.Kangkong with sambal - flavour is nice but too saltish.Claypot liver - a bit too hard. Used to be very good - tender.So disappointed.Don't think I will ever come here again. There are better places to go to.Still lots of tourists. Think it's because they can't tell the difference
5
We walked from Orchard road, its about 15 minutes from Cuppage road.Fatty's passed away, but his son 'skinny' runs a very popular Basic restaurant.If you are counting street numbers its in a side mall off Belcoolen Street.We had the spring rolls [delicious] Chicken in clay pot [ superb sauce] and Salted prawns . the dishes come in 3 sizes and small is enough for 2, because you can try more.Singapore noodle and fried rice both looked great and washed down with beer , was still great value ,not hawker centre cheap, but great value -- you are not going for the decor and don't get too dressed u
2
After reading many favorable reviews about this restaurant we decided to give it a chance. The furniture of the venue is very "spartan", to say the least. We had to ask for a knife. Our orders were taken by the owner to whom we asked for suggestion, considering that we wished prawns, possibly cooked in 2 different ways. I forgot the name of this dishes but they were both so full of fat to be close to "disgusting". Looking around we could understand that a good portion of the customers were at their first experience (like ourselves) and later on we perceived some comments not really favorable to what they ate. Friendly staff? Maybe, but actually we came to eat not to socialize...
5
Met some friends who are regulars at Fatty's and loved the atmosphere, the staff and the food. The prawns were very well cooked and tasty- hats off!
4
Fantastic quality at a decent price for Singapore. The Chicken clay pot is wonderful and the the Singapore noodles are also a must try. We had about 6-7 dishes not one had any negatives from anyone.

Visited for the first time last night and was impressed. The food was very nice and extremely good value for money. I would recommend the Spring Rolls, Indonesian Prawns and BBQ Pork.
5
Great food with ok ambiance.
Ordered beef hotpot, sliced fish and veggies.
Delicious foods and cold beer - how could you go wrong.
5
Now let me tell you I bloody love Chinese food and this by far is one of the best I've ever been, food portions large and delicious staff very friendly, and properly the cheapest beers around! This is a must visit!!!!!!!!!!
Well played FATTY'S !!!

We arrived just after 7pm on a Friday and were lucky to get a table.
Food was excellent and a fair price. What more could you want
5
The restaurant serves various delicious Chinese food. Their Home Made Beancurd is a must try. One of the best, if not the best in town. Another must try from they menu is the Black Pepper prawn. its conveniently located near Rochor Mrt and Bugis Mrt.

Read some really good review of this restaurant on TripAdvisor and decided to give it a try since a friend is staying in nearby hotel.Went with a group of friends and true enough, it didn't disappoint. The food was awesome. Here's what we ordered, roasted duck which has juicy meat yet the skin was still crispy. Sweet & sour pork, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Cereal prawn, which they were really generous with the cereal. Chilli (sambal) Kang Kong, 3 eggs spinach and their famous tofu dish, all of which were fantastic. Best of all, the price is reasonable too considering its location. The waitress is always smiling and helpful. Will definitely come again, that's for sure.
5
DEFINITELY stop by this restaurant for amazing service and delicious, delicious food. I went there twice in my two nights in Singapore and had the fried rice with shrimp, beef with spring onion and ginger and a chilli chicken broth which was to die for. Great prices and highly recommended
5
Fatty's must be one of the best street restaurants around. It has great variety from venison to Singapore Chilli Crab and lots more including the standards of sweet and sour, steamed fish etc. The "brothers skinny" run a great team . Sitting outside, having a cold beer and great food is a treat
5
Return visit. Great food,great service and good value Chinese style food. Very good value for food and beer. The prawn and beef dishes are top range. Double visit this week and even better the second time!
3
Great food served quickly, the restaurant is always full and we booked tables, it is a bit run down though most of the tables are out on the street. Food makes up for it though, the spring rolls and sweet and sour chicken very good
4
This is a wonderful restaurant, very casual with decades of history. Fantastic food , reasonably priced and great beer. I recommend this establishment for all occasions
4
Wing Seong Fatty is an established old restaurant that still exist with traditional dishes and cooking method.
Prices are very reasonable
5
A friend who has been to Singapore many times took us to Fattys. Nothing flash to look at and you eat out of orange melamine bowls. However, the food is absolutety brilliant and the service fantastic. It was so good that two days later, without the friend we took a map and found our way back. How's this for service.... the owner (grandson of the original Fattys) known as Skinny, remembered us as being there a couple of days earlier and made us most welcome. This place is extremely popular and I believe sometimes you have to wait for a table. By all means wait because the food is fantastic
5
My daughter and I were in Bugis in the evening and chanced upon Fatty's. On the night we were there it was bustling with customers, including many tourists, and the waitress motioned for us to sit at a table outside.We ordered a sweet and sour chicken, a plate of mixed vegetables, a pork and egg fried rice and two cold drinks and the total cost was $41.90. We were very hungry when we arrived but we struggled to finish the food because the servings were so big. In saying that though, we just couldn't stop eating because it was all so very good.The sweet and sour chicken was amazing. The coating on the chicken was crispy and not thick and gluggy as it is at some places. The fried rice was fantastic and not at all oily and the vegetables were cooked to perfection.Now to the service. It is a finely oiled machine. The waiters looked to be mainly 'mature' aged and seemed to know exactly what table ordered what dish even though the tables didn't have numbers. When I asked for the bill, the waitress just motioned for me to go inside to the counter and another waiter had a word to the cashier and told him what we had ordered. It was all exactly right.One thing we observed. It seems that they are o.k. with you lingering if there are other tables available for guests coming through the door, however I observed the waitress telling a man to get up and go inside to settle his bill because he and his partner were lingering over a few too many beers and their table was required for new customers. I don't have a problem with that.I'll definitely be going back when I'm next in Singapore
4
Got taken here by a friend who's been going for years,Sweet and sour pork was excellent as was the chicken the kids had, crispy and tasty.My friends "Nuclear Chicken" was right on the Money with good spice and flavour .Portions are large we massively over ordered.Would definitely come again.
4
Fatty's gets a lot of different / mixed reviews. We've been going there for 15 years with overseas colleagues, friends, families and with people of very different pallets ...and conclude ...If you know what to order, this place is fantastic !Start with their Garlic Prawns (huge, delicious, sautÃ©ed with Garlic). Have a few chilled beers while you order.They are better at their Pepper Crab rather than Chilli Crab. Also must try their Ginger SpringOnion Deer meat (succulent and no MSG). Their YungChow Chow Faan (mixed fried rice) is fantastic and so is their Crispy Chicken (roasted not fried).You must know that the older Waiters and Waitresses are almost partners/ owners/ family - so don't expect smiling faces and constant greetings (infact they may look grumpy) but they are actually Very friendly and helpful
3
Haven't been here for a Long Long time.Corn & pork soup - nice, meat tenderSweet & sour pork - not crispy. Used to be very good.Kangkong with sambal - flavour is nice but too saltishClaypot liver - a bit too hard. Used to be very good - tender.Don't think I will ever come here again. There are better places to go to

Saw this on tripadvisor and decided to try a Chinese, got the hotel concierge to book, he seemed rather bemused. Took a taxi which dropped us at a shopping mall. Rather taken aback when we found it, formica tables and plastic chasir, plus plastic bowls. Unsure what to do but lady saw us and asked if we 'were the ones that booked?' so took a seat, outside rather than inside a very brightly lit basic style cafe. Asked for wine list to go with menu but they dob't sell wine or any spirits, just beer. She sent us to a shop next door to buy a bottle of wine, bizarre. Order taken, waitress did try to direct us to dishes, they were a bit put out that we asked for napkins, got small paper serviettes. Even had to ask the wine shop for two glasses, food came quickly, hot and fine but had to eat it while shoppers walked past, staring, felt so out of place. Go if you want a cheap and cheerful meal with absolutely no niceties and do not wear anything other than work clothes and of course the obligatory back pack! Actually amazed we stayed, all over in about 30 mins when a very old man came and whipped everything away and chucked in a wheelie bin situated about 10 metres away from us. Out of our comfort zone to say the least, this is a basic, basic place.
5
Authentic , fresh, nice range of dishes and good service. What more could you want if you fancy Chinese in Singapore. This is an institution in the City and highly enjoyable.
5
Fatty's has been around for a long time 30years to my knowlage it is just a basic street restarant,with great food,for me a visit to Singapore would not be compleat without dinner at Fattys
5
Properly the finest Chinese I've eaten in Asia and that's a big call. All meals here are hard to beat even the rice is special....Crab is delicious cooked how you want and staff are amazing.
5
Very busy,popular place to eat. If you are here for only a few days it would be advisable to book, especially at weekends. Great, freshly cooked food and good portions too. Buzzing atmosphere and thoroughly enjoyable
5
Just the best food ever. Plastic bowls, who cares, what's in them is simply superb and ridiculously inexpensive.
It's a place loved by local, expats and airline crew. They know a good thing and this is it.
Can't wait for another trip.
5
This place had been recommended by a friend who visits Singapore regularly. It is very busy and we were the only western visitors when we had dinner in the week before Chinese New Year. The location is slightly off the beaten track but it is well worth looking for. Well away from Chinatown it serves high quality authentic food which shows up much of what is served in more well known areas and tourist restaurants. Expect it to be busy with lots of local families and forget about knives and forks as chopsticks are the way to enjoy the food here at its best
5
Having read the reviews, and as we were staying only 300 metres away, where better to eat on our first night. Inside was already full at 6.15pm but we were given an outside table. Originally run by the owner, nicknamed Fatty, it is now run by his son- Skinny! I think it was himself who served us. We ordered fairly conservatively two medium dishes and two small, but the waiter changed the order to four small, as he said that this would be enough- he was so right, just perfect portions for us. We ordered the scallops with broccoli, chicken with cashews, yeung chow fried rice and fried vegetables. Couldn't fault the food at all, and the service was brilliant. The price- S$57, about Â£28 for two.We will certainly revisit if we plan to eat out again
5
The place is existing since more than 40 years and the food quality ist the best in town. Service is good. Try the lemon chicken and the chicken with dried chilles is fantastic. easy to find as located opposit the sim lim building! Also outside sitting!
5
I first went to Fatty's in 1962 when in the RAF at SeletarEvery time Since (8 visits to Singapore) I have gone to Fatty'sThe Standard has always been very good - Food is always good and reasonably pricedLast visit in February 2016 my wife and I went 3 times as we are always made welcome by all the staff -owner in particularThe menu is varied so if you like Chinese Food you are spoilt for choiceTo find it go to Bugis on the MRT then go through Bugis Street Market and walk through to Albert Stree
5
I've just been all over Asia and had all kinds of chili crab but this was by far the best I've ever tasted. So buttery and spicy (not too spicy) and hints of peanut etc etc. It'll run you about 50S$ for a good portion but Singapore is expensive and this was my favorite restaurant. There was even a miscommunication with my bill and they sided with me which i find is very rare when you travel. The bbq duck/pork combo plate was also very good and will run you 15S
4
My friend suggested this place to eat...it's where the locals go. Plastic chairs, great atmosphere, yummy food, quick service and a good price. We had 4 dishes plus two local beers for $54..pretty good value we thought...
5
Simply Outstanding!!! Ordered 3 dishes. Prawns in black pepper, chili crab and shredded duck in noodles. All winners. Been in Asia a month. This was one of the best !!!
5
The best food that we had whilst in Singapore by a long way. Beer is cheap. Very varied Asian food menu that is brilliantly prepared and will not dissapoint. The take away is also fantastic . A large chicken fried rice is about a KG.
5
This restaurant is a bit of an institution apparently and was recommended by the concierge. No fuss, brisk service; piping hot and delicious food. If I lived here it would quickly become a valued favourite.
5
Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The most memorable being the braised short ribs and egg role. I've traveled through China and live in NYC and this place lands in my top 5! Be prepared to wait.
3
Great food! Tasty, good portions and cheap. Initially the restaurant looks old, small and simple but the quality of the food compensates. They should improve the toilet. When I used it was completely wet and gives the impression that is dirty.
4
Really enjoyed the spring rolls, kangkong, salted fish rice and roast meats. Wouldn't have the prawn paste chicken or chicken curry again though. Nice place to chill with a beer and watch the world go by.
5
Not in a very touristy area but near the MRT. I first went here almost 20 years ago because of it's history linking it to WWII and aviation. They don't have many tables. I arrived when they opened both visits and by the time I left all the tables were full, mostly with locals. I experienced the same thing when I went here in the 1990's. Their menu is large and varied but I have only had the crab. Their chili crab is sweet not spicy. If you want something spicy I would go for the black pepper crab.
4
I was introduced to Fatty's a few years ago now and go back at least once every couple of weeks. So much so I order a dish off menu.So the last two times have been with my family visiting...we had to have the Singapore noodles as the kids are addicted to them back in Scotland from McChans chuck wagon in Kinnaird Park (classy, I know).They went down a treat, as did everything else - from the springrolls, to the mongolian beef, it does its job so well - it feeds you and your guests for a reasonable price. Of course being Singapore, we won't mention the beer cost :)Go, and you'll want to go again - I do - my kids loved it, my Mum loved it...colleagues go back to the UK and talk about it as an experience.Yes, the service can be a bit brusque, but I find that's part of the allure
4
We tried to find it with our GPS and took were less than 150 feet from it on Bencoolen St. and found lit see it. It is up some steps on a pedestrian street behind the Sim Lim Plaza and not visible from Bencoolen street. Inside is air conditioned but most sit outside under the big awning and there are lots of rotating fans. We ordered medium black pepper shrimp and seafood fried noodles along with two large Tiger beers and it was more than enough for two. Both were delicious. Service was great until we wanted to get the check and that took some signaling. Total cost including tax was SG$57, a lot less than we had paid previously in some of the Indian Restaurants in Little India. The big beers were SG$7 each and filled two mugs, vs. SG$11 in the other restaurants for a pint
5
Fantastic with amazing street food. Everything I ate here was fantastic. And the price (for Singapore) was very fair. There is also a great history with the place with the original owner sneaking food to WW11 prisoners in Changi.
Super food.
5
I first visited Fatty's 40 years ago...and from that memory I felt I had to return! It hasn't changed...only managed to get better! We ordered the sweet and sour pork, beef in black bean and crispy duck...AMAZING!
5
What a great place to eat, popular with Europeans and locals alike. Service quickest I have ever seen, food fresh and tasty and lots of choice .Very busy at all times but we always got seated. Good prices too.

This restaurant has a long history in Singapore,from a humble food push cart in Albert Streetserving cantonese dishes to a modern butsimple restaurant still serving old cantonese standards& newer dishes like chilli crabs etc.As we plan to dine on a sunday evening we made a reservations,which just as well as the restaurant was full for a 7 pm reservations.We were asked if we wanted to sit in the air-conditioned section ot theopen air terrace.When I enquired if they serve crabs, they helpfully asked if I like to reservea crab or so; which I prudently did.We ordered their signature fried sprong rolls, fried sweet potato leaves,tuo fu seafood casserole, emperor pork ribs, mussels with black beans,chilli crab and fried man tou buns to go with the chilli crab.I did not order their signature fried kway teow as it would not complementwith the dishes ordered.The standard of cooking was satisfactory but the dishes stood out werethe simple fried sweet potato leaves & emperor pork ribs.Their chilli crab was so so. I figured it tasted a tad salty and not sweet& tart enough. I tasted some fried bits of dried shrimps in the chillicrab gravy.Dessert : Very limited choices. The ladies ordered their inhouse-made soya bean curd with longans. Overall food rating : 6 out of 10Tips : 1. There is no corkage if you bring your own wine but do not expect a wine bucket,wine glasses etc. We were given plain shot whiskey glasses, well can't complain with such small mercies.  2. The restaurant may be difficult to locate but just go to Burlington  Square at Bencoolen street & walk to the boulevard behid Sim Lim Square. 3. Tel no : 6338 1087 4. Operating hours : 12 noon to 2.30 9m & 5.15 pm to 10.15 p
5
Found this restaurant while taking a walk near our hotel. It is on the outside of Burlington Square on Bencoolen Street. The food is great and the service was very good. Beer at about $5 a large bottle is good value. First night wife had a medium sweet and sour pork and I had small chicken with cashews and a large fried rice. Sharing meal only just able to finish the meal. Had two large bottles of Tiger as well total of meal was about $55 which I think is good value for Singapore. Went back several times and enjoyed meals and watching world go by. Would recommend if in Singapore try this place out. If going by taxi ask to be dropped off at Burlington Square on Bencoolen Street you just have to walk across the road and your there
5
Don't often go places that look this this does from the outside but the food is absolutely amazing, yeah you have to eat of plastic plates and staff could do with a bit of work. But it's quality cheap food and well worth a visit or two.
4
Friends who have visited here have always told us to try this restaurant so on our recent trip to Singapore we did.Restaurant doesn't have the best decor or outlook and is nothing flash to look at but the food and service is great.After looking at the menu we still didn't know what to order. A chinese server suggested dishes so we went ahead.We started with Spring Rolls, then Peppered Beef, Chicken with Cashews and Sweet and sour Prawns. Fried Rice any my husband had a Tiger Beer, I had a soft drink all for about $60.All meals were brought out quickly, and hot and we shared all dishes. Very tasty meal which we thoroughly enjoyed. We were pleased that we came here
5
Could well be the best place to eat in Singapore! Yes it's that good. Very cheap. Rustic and not the best speakers of English but the food is amazing. If you don't eat anywhere else all trip eat here. Well worth 5 stars and I will be back
5
We loved street food! But never been to Singapore, this place was recommended by a local bar girl. We loved the food & price is really reasonable too. Sitting by side id shopping centre watching the world passes by. Don't fret, we didn't know what to order either, just ask the waitress to recommend something..
4
Following the reviews we chose four small dishes for two of us. These were all good, but the combo pork and duck excellent. Beer was the cheapest I have found but it was curious to note the hand towelettes were charged for. Even so it was as promised. Great. The restaurant is set back from the road between two buildings and took some finding as its not visible from Belconnen road
4
Apparently a long standing Singapore tradition - nothing fancy, just well cooked, quickly served, tasty local dishes.
5
A work colleague told us about this restaurant - he had been there years ago and said it was great. We agree. We had an awesome meal - not as cheap as a Hawker Centre but certainly very good quality.
3
There are not many vegetarian options available but for meat-eaters the price-quality is ok. Drinks selection is quite limited and there is no wine available.
4
Lunch at Fatty's was very good. The menu was good and the food was delivered quickly and was very tasty, and the Tiger beer was cold!
4
Was recommend by the nice lady behind the bar of Albert Court Hotel and we were not disappointed. Great service and excellent food.
5
I am going to this restaurant since 1981 every time, when I am in Singapore. It was not always there at its current place. It even was onetime on Santosa Island, but always found it and was served great meals and found staff very friendly.
4
Although the children have taken over the reins from Fatty (from the days of Albert Street), they managed to retain the tradition and cook up some of the best cze char dishes. My fave include the braised chicken in claypot, pork ribs braised with bitter gourd, Emperor's prime ribs, yam ring with prawns and mak choy (Chinese Romaine lettuce) stir-fried in fermented bean curd.The restaurant is now air-conditioned with some open-air seats reminiscent of the days when they operated along Albert Street. There are lots more tourists these days but don't let that deter you as the quality of the food is consistently good. Has been and will continue to be one of my favourite cze char restaurants offering authentic Cantonese cuisine
5
I was recommended by several people to eat here. It's not fancy but it's cheap and very delicious!!! Fast fresh food not far from bustling Bugis street! It's def worth a visit. Cold tiger beer too at only $4.50 a bottle. On two seperate occasions I had peppered beef, fried rice, indo chicken curry, char siew pork, and fried noodles!! All delicious!!! For two of us we had the small serves... And we still couldn't finish it!! The place is packed with tourists and it's worth it!
2
This restaurant was high on TripAdvisor's review rating. N was also recommended by a few traveller friends. I wouldn't recommend this place. It's a tourist flavoured food, made for people with a sweet tooth even for dinner.Their portions were small and service was rushed.Not my idea of good food by any standard.
4
About 10mins walk from bugis met station and Down bugis street, you will find fat Alberts It's good wholesome delicious Chinese food. It's quite near to sim lim square where they sell electronics goodsSo men, the family can wait for you at the restaurant whilst you browse through aim lim for gadgets...win winEnjo
5
We live close by and this is one of our regulars.
Food and service always great, would definitely recommend.
5
A trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete without eating here. Really honest and helpful staff assist you in ordering what you like, and their recommendation didn't fail. We went back again because it was so good. Also, the lime juice is great! Highly recommend.
5
the Chicken Cashew! It is so good that we had to come back twice! The service is very quick and nice.
5
The restaurant itself isn't anything fancy, but the food is excellent. We had sweet and sour fish, duck, prawns & broccoli with carrot, as well as fried rice. We are all full and very satisfied. The prices are reasonable and the do byo.
5
Every time we come to Singapore, we head straight for Fatty's and this time was no exception and we certainly were not disappointed!! The food is still as good as ever and their Sweet and Sour Prawns are the best we have ever had. We also tried their chicken and fried noodles and special fried rice as well as Chicken and Cashew nuts and everything was delicious. Well worth a visit. Prices are realistic for Singapore. Be careful not to order too much as their portions are very generous. Rather order more if you are still hungry as they are very quick. We ordered a small noodles and medium rice and were not able to finish them. We sat out on the pavement and enjoyed the wonderful warm weather, but they do have an airconditioned area inside
5
We were recommended by crew who works for the airline business to try this cheap and cheerful restaurant. The staff were very friendly and were lovely towards our 4yr son, making sure he was seated comfortably, had utensils instead of chopsticks and engaging with him whilst we ordered our food. They also popped over every now and again to check that the food was ok for our son.The food was superb! We had sweet/sour chicken, BBQ pork, fried rice with Chinese sausages and chilli crab. My son who is a fussy eater managed to eat everything apart from the chilli crab. The chilli crab was lovely but it was messy to eat as not all the shell were cracked for us, plus you don't get a plastic bib, finger bowls or any other utensils similar to those if you were eating at a lobster restaurant. That was our only very minor quibble but you do get wet wipes.Food were reasonably priced and we would return again if we are ever back in the country. The restaurant was packed when we were there, with quite a few locals, which confirms that the food must be good
4
Singapore has become very expensive over the last few years. Working in the airline business as crew we tend to gravitate towards certain types of place and Fatty's is just such a place. It is an easy place to eat that provides good food at good value. Not the most sophisticated place I've been but that's not why you go. Service is OK but very casual. One thing is for sure, you will leave feeling replete
4
A couple of minutes walk from bugis mrt.Mix of tourists of different nationalities and locals. Seating inside and outside, your choice. Food is good chinese food. We had pork, beef and duck dishes, all good, washed down by 3 large tiger beers. Total about S$60.Recommend. ....
5
I've started to be a regular at this restaurant and it never fails to please. Great food and great value for money. I would say the food is more like a Western Style Chinese Restaurant but serving great tasting Cantonese food. Its not what you would call a classy restaurant, more like an upmarket food court restaurant but its value for money. usually quite busy and if you don't book you can end up queuing
5
Popped in for dinner on a quick trip to Singapore. The food was excellent and extremely affordable. Service was great. All in all a great experience. This is not a fancy restaurant. If you are looking to impress with cutlery, tablecloths and other things that look good, this is not the place. If it's food you're after though, you'll not be sorry.
5
We have been many times for dinner at this restaurant.The food is always nice.....and prices are reasonable...good value for money...Tables are available indoors and outdoors at the large terrace.
5
Just happened to pass this place, it was packed out but we found a table. Food was great and owner was very friendly. A definite place to re visit.
5
This place was recommended by an expat friend. The menu is kept simple and they have quite a few memorable specialties such as Indonesian curry prawns, popiah (deep fried springrolls), and yam ring. Bringing one's own wine is allowed without corkerage charges. They even provide wine glasses when available. The management and staff are both friendly and helpful, and could even remember their regulars' faces and often asked requests such as extra chilli. Food is served quickly once ordered. Indoor dining can be noisy though but is welcomed because of the aircon compared to sitting outdoor where it is hot and humid. We always choose this place for special gathering such as Chinese New Year, birthdays and year end meetings due to it's central location and the above mentioned factors
5
We asked a local cabbie where to go for lunch and he recommended this place and we were not disappointed. The service was very fast, friendly and efficient, and best of all air-conditioned. We ordered the small size portion and it was very good size. My husband ordered the chilli prawn Indonesian style, not overly hot and very flavoursome. I ordered the chicken with cashews and beef with spring ginger, the spring rolls were huge so only order one per person. Overall great meal and great value, highly recommend
5
This place was a welcome retreat from the busy streets of Singapore. The service is really relaxed and really efficient. The food is good quality, very reasonably priced and the Tiger beer is nice and cold! We went back 3 times over our week long trip. Yum
4
I had been here before so when we decided to visit Singapore , I wanted my wife to sample "Fatty's". She wasn't disappointed, considering the surrounding's! This doesn't come better for Singapore street food. I would recommend the Prawn and Sweet and Sour Chicken with fried rice washed down with Chinese beer. The price is amazing - a must for Singapore
4
The previous evening we had spent a fortune on a substandard meal on the harbour - so on advise from BA crew, we visited Fatty's and knew what to expect.You are not paying for fancy surroundings. We sat outside, plastic tables, plates and cutlery - we were advised to take our own wine as they don't sell it, but the boys were able to order beers.The food was much better than the previous evening (1/3rd of the price) - and we visited again the following evening.Good food and very well price
5
Certainly not fancy surroundings but don't be put off. The tables may be formica but the food which arrives is definitely the best Chinese we have had in Singapore (at any price level). Seating outside is probably more atmospheric but there are also inside tables with air-con. The family that run the restaurant are delightful, honest, hard working people, who guide you through the menu and recommend portion sizes - it always seems to work out that everybody has enjoyed a feast and no waste.The food is piping hot when served and although cooked to order the wait is minimal. Suggest you aim for earlier in the evening as very popular, or ring and book a table. Beer, water, soft drinks served - no wine, although they are more than happy for you to take your own, provide you with wine glasses and don't even charge corkage.Thoroughly recommend Fatty's and suitable for dining on your own, or large groups seated on round tables. Excellent value for money, yesterday our group of ten people enjoyed a huge choice, including beers etc. and it was under $300, including GST - service charge is not added to the bill, very rare in Singapore and we were more than happy to leave a tip, which was thoroughly deserved
5
We ate here 3 of our 6 nights simply because we love the food. It is always fresh & delicious. Nothing fancy about laminate tables & plastic chairs but who cares when the food is great & very reasonably priced. My tip would be to go for an early dinner or be prepared to wait for a table. Could go a char keoy teow & an ice cold Tiger right now
4
The menu has a typical range of dishes found in most honest restaurants in Europe, but much, much tastier. The sweet and sour sea bass was excellent! Other dishes also delicious. The place was really busy, but food and service was quick to come. The atmosphere is one of an old style coffee shop, which is pretty much what it used to be. As it was so busy, it was really buzzing. And it wasn't just expats there - a good mix of locals as well. Lots of big tables, so suitable for group outings. Probably best to reserve!We will go back and try it again
4
Visited Fatty's last year after a thirty year absence and it was good.......nothing's changed at Fatty's still provides a mix of attentive service, good food and, of course, Tiger beer.
5
Just down the pedestrian mall from our digs at Albert Court Village - we walked past day and night and this place was jumping. We tend to stick to the hawker centres for local meals - but tonight featured on of Singapore's spectacular downpours- so we peeled off under cover and after a short wait, snagged a table. Service was quick, choices wide, food delicious and beer cold. Very reasonable. We will be back
5
I have been here previously and loved it so I took my family who were over from Scotland on holiday one night 2 weeks ago They all enjoyed it so much we went back for their last night in Singapore . Food Staff and Value for money are all excellen
4
Staying in Singapore in transit to NZ we passed this place on the way to our hotel, it looked busy and obviously patronised by many locals, always a good sign, so we decided to give it a try.So good we went back again.Very reasonable and excellent foo
4
It's not a chic Restaurant as you seat on round tables with plastic cutleries, but food is heaven.It's a local restaurant close to Sim Lim Square, got there by mistake and it was packed by people, I managed to get a table and i was speechless as food was gorgeous.Of i have been back several times with the same result
2
We visit Fatty's every year we go to Singapore (and usually a couple times each holiday) as it is one of our favourites. Very disappointed this visit - service was very slow - we ordered two main meals - the first one arrived and waited 25 minutes for the other main - despite constantly asking staff when the food would arrive. Staff weren't bothered - I really think they don't care anymore if you come back or not
4
Went here with some Singapore and Malay friends and had a very enjoyable, but quick, meal even though we shared eight dishes between us. Given the streetside café style with cheap laminated tables this is probably to be expected. It is very much a restaurant for a fix of good Chinese food rather than a venue for a night’s dining.Sweet and Sour Pork and Spring Rolls were superb and the Singapore BeeHoon, was also very good and their pork chops – I don’t know how they cooked them, were just fabulous. The other four dishes were good but not memorable as they were similar in quality and taste to what you would get in hundreds of other Singaporean restaurants.Some other reviewers complained of the service. Ours was very good but I can still empathize with what them. My Singapore friend took charge of ordering the meal and bossing the waitresses about with the result that the food flowed quickly but in sequence, so I can’t really complain on that score. In general, though with the place so busy – we visited on a Saturday evening and it was buzzin’ – that the staff looked very hassled and on the edge of being rude, although they were no match for my mate. Not a place of a romantic dinner for too but well fit for purpose otherwise

Got a tip from a local and headed down with a list of Salt and Pepper Prawns, Nuclear Chicken in Clay Pot extra hot and Salted Fried Fish Rice and BBQ Pork.Wasn't expecting amazing but the whole experience was top drawer.. Plastic chairs Ice Cold beer to 4 dishes that really were excellent. Fun atmosphere and mix of punters but the food was stunning. So good we went back for lunch the next day !!Seen the mixed reviews since but for me amazing on both occasions

Very mediocre experience. My 8 over-cooked chilli prawns ($28) came swimming in a thick, gravy-like sauce that had no discernible flavour. A small bowl of rice was an additional 80c, and the towel 30c. The service was disinterested. When I replied 'no' to the question 'did I enjoy the meal' it went unremarked. When compared with the quality and price of other restaurants in the vicinity, it just doesn't cut it. Don't bother

We chose this place based on trip advisor reviews and were not disappointed. The service was excellent, waitress was very helpful and advised on which dishes are popular, and what is traditional Singaporean food. The food itself was amazing, best spring rolls I've ever eaten, and the prawns with pepper sauce were fresh and delicious.
5
Food is of an excellent quality and authentic cuisine. Have to be firm if you book that you get a table inside rather than outside (if you want air conditioning). Portions were of a good size. After dinner an easy walk to Bugis Street Markets.
5
Fantastic food. The fried rice is delicious as are most of their other dishes.
It gets very crowded on weekends so you might need to wait. Also most of the seating is outdoors so go in the evening.

I only review really good or bad restaurants and in this case, it's sadly a bad case of "once good, now terrible" joint. I had a simple quick lunch with my friend on a weekday and we chose a simple noodle hor fun dish each. The Chinese national waitress was immediately rude and snappy when she knew we were not ordering a banquet, she removed our plate of peanuts and wet tissues away almost instantly (we would have to pay if we wanted them) after taking our order, as if we were cheap Charlie customers. She turned and actually made a mocking face to her colleague and shook her head. I saw it at the corner of my eyes. This happened when the restaurant was only half empty so every customer was still good business. I was shocked and kept quiet and watched discretely. Her colleague brought the food to our table and put them down rather rudely as if we were not welcomed. I have been to Fatty's when I was younger and when it was an institution in Bugis Street; it was once good and famous. So I was hopeful the food would live up to it's past fame despite the service. No, it did not pass for a restaurant, once famous or otherwise. The noodle was soggy, the fish was not fresh, the vegetable was over cooked, the gravy was too starchy. Both of our dishes were below expectation and restaurant standards. Mind you, it was not cheap and hawker food usually tasted much better at a lower price. With the terrible service, the food was not redeemable at all. It would be the last time I would ever visit. Don't be fooled, a fish noodle hor fun dish is not the hardest to cook and the chef failed miserably. I decided not to give feedback to the cashier when I left as it would not have helped future customers. So here I am. Their glory days are over. After the meal, I found out that numerous friends and colleagues also did not like their food anymore and stopped going. So be warned ... don't waste good money here, look elsewhere in coffee shops and hawker centres for better food, lower prices and much better service. You deserve it. Can I give zero star?

This place used to be really good. I almost had it every week for a period of time because it was so good and the ingredients were fresh.Now? I won't ever step back again.This week I had a craving for their food so I purposefully went down to the restaurant and purchased chilli crab, san lau hor fun as well as mantou to go with the chilli crab.I asked for the crab rate and it was $47. To be honest it's not very cheap but I had confidence in their cooking so I said fine. Give me a kg crab. What a terrible shock I've got.The crab I got home is between 600 - 700g (while I was being charged for the full rate) and though one of the pincer looks big; it was hollow inside with little to no meat. It is already weird that we have pincers of different size but then fine.. there's no crab roe.No crab roe, no meat nothing and less than 700g but you're charging me full rate with a sauce that taste like sweet chilli from NTUC condiment section? Crap really.Then I tried the Hor Fun. It was not good too. No wok hei, taste like oil and though the fish slices were there; it didn't have the fish taste it should have. Nor is the beansprout smell there. One of the worst san lau I have tried recently.I don't know if they have changed their chef or whatsoever (I know the original founder have passed on but can't be sure) but they shouldn't be so dishonest. I might have been shocked by the standard of food but I wouldn't rate it this bad.I would give it zero stars if it's possible.BAD. Not ever going again

Came here for a dinner after am afternoon of rain - decided to risk it and sit outside. Thankfully it did not rain and we enjoyed the relatively cooler air and fantastic food, Good Cantonese using fresh ingredients - and not too oily. Very unassuming place that puts food first. Seafood is fresh, meat really well cooked, veggies just dine right - and the spring rolls were some of the best I have ever had - not greasy or oily as you can find elsewhere - see pics. Go here - it is great

We were pointed to this place by the flight crew on our Qantas flight, where they are regular eaters there. Have a look behind the counter, even a Qantas emblem is on the wall!! The restaurant is nothing to rave about, very much a locals place with laminated tables and basic chairs, but the food is excellent. We have the chilli crab, fiddly but oh so delicious. And try the black pepper prawns, nothing like that here in Australia at all!! The night we were there, we were the only Caucasians in the place, but we were made very welcome by Fatty (the owner) and everything was explained on the menu. If you are looking for a place away from the tourists, go to Fatty's!
5
We just had a staff dinner at Fatties. The service was great, the tables a really good size for ten people. The lazy susan in the middle of the table works really well for the big group. It was actually pretty good prices for our group.If you want a good table you have to book ahead but they are really obliging. A friend we were with tested the waitress who could remember his order. Nice friendly staff.As Australians we support this Fatties as they used to sneak food into the POW's at Changi. You can see on the walls in the restaurant that QANTAS and the Australian military also support this when they are in town
5
The food here was excellent, mainly Chinese dishes although a few Malay dishes too. We had a crispy pork dish some garlic fried kai lag and a malay prawn dish all excellent. Would suggest a table outside rather than in as that was where all the action was and it was good to watch the hustle bustle of street life outside as we ate. Service and drinks were basic but perfectly pleasant
5
This was my second visit to Singapore and one of the things I was most looking forward to coming back was my first meal at Fatty's. It did not disappoint. This is some seriously good food. The combo plate with duck and pork has to be the best dish I have ever eaten, and it is perfect every single time. Their fried rice is also the best. I really don't think you can have a bad dish here. If the older lady waitress suggests you order something, just order it. She has never steered us wrong
4
Fattys is always one of our first stops for a dinkum (real) chines meal whenever we come to Singapore. It never disappoints in terms of quality and quantity of food and the service and atmosphere is great . I admit that it becomes a bit of a challenge if it rains as tables and seats simply spill out into the mall as customers arrive. Fattys is one of the few places where you will be told that one dish will be enough if you order two thinking you will need two. Fattys is also one of those places where you can safely experiment with new tastes with no health concerns.
4
We liked this place for lunch. The food was very good, the restrooms were clean, the beer was cold. It was frequented by locals, and that was a very good sign. It's not "romantic" or anything like that. Just good. We'd go back.
4
Such nice food here, roasted duck/pork/char suit, beef Clay pot and spring roll, OK price for Singapore too. Service was a little rude hence not giving it a 5.
5
An institution as everyone else has said, great choice, nothing fancy about the place, very clean though, you will have a really good meal, cold drinks and very prompt service, all for a very reasonable price!
5
Have been going to this restaurant for the last 30 years. Always excellent food. Never been let down. Very reasonably priced. Good cold beers. Have introduced many friends - who have become repeat customers.
5
We were recommended to visit this place - and I didn't realise how close it was to Sim Lim Centre - when I say close, it literally is a stone throw away (directly opposite on the pedestrian walkway). Easy to walk past without realising!The ambience is great - and it very low-key, but the food quality and choice is perfect. Not a huge place, but definitely worth a visit. Very friendly service but you must come early as it does get very busy.We went for Fried Beef, Char Siu, Rice and Dau Miu (pea shoots). Fine food, fine service and definitely delicious
5
I decided to try out the restaurant while I was staying nearby and searched Tripadvisor for a nice place to dine. The first impression when I arrived was quite good, especially since a lot of locals where also visiting the restaurant. After I took a seat I was immediately greeted very friendly and could take a look at the menu which contains quite a variety of delicious sounding dishes. As I was a bit unsure which dish to take I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she recommended the marinated pork which indeed tasted great and was perfectly cooked, so good even, that I decided to visit again two days later to also try some duck and baked sweet and sour chicken which tasted evenly great (and definitely left no more place in my stomach). Apart from the great taste and the good quality all meals seem to be very reasonably priced which makes the place a great recommendation to try some authentic cantonese food
5
This is a great place to eat in Singapore! Great Chinese food at amazing prices and full of local people... I was part of a party of 9, service was quick and efficient and the prices aren't bad at all. It was very busy, we had booked a table but lots of people were being turned away
4
Was told this was the best restaurant in Singapore which was a lot of hype to live up to. But it was a spot on judgement. The best Chinese food I've ever eaten, really good value for money, lovely staff and the place has a fantastic history. The only downfall is that it's half way around the world and I want to eat some sweet and sour fish now. A must.
4
If you like pork go here. Walking distance from Bugis MRT and very close to Sim Lim Square. They do everything else that any tze cha restaurant does, but their pork is extra special. Take as many people as you can, get a bowl of rice each, and order many dishes to share
5
Great food and service with the added extra of being able to sit outdoors. Staff arranged extra tables for our group of 12 so we were not kept waiting. Food was delicious and the menu varied. They are able to do vegetarian dishes to order that are not on the menu. Well worth the taxi ride to get here
4
Went to fattys with friends who live in Singapore, good food, the service is what it is! I doubt whether the owners have ever heard of trip advisor or give a monkeys if they did! Fattys is what it is! Good food great fun!
5
I appreciate Fatty's. Tradition with finest taste and quick service are their attributes. It has still the style and freindlyness of the eighties. My favorites: Ginger beef, black pepper prawns, the famous "Quantas Menue" and a Tsingtao beer. No other restaurant can top that.
4
The food was delicious. We really enjoyed eating there. Everything was fresh and plenty of it. Probably the best meal we had in Singapore. No hidden extras like some places.
5
Amazing food with friendly staff! Absolutely blew me away! Small and local but overall an outstanding dinner!!
5
People joke about the four things to do in Singapore: shopping, eating, eating and shopping. Between these choices, eating is definitely the top.Fatty's is one of those places that makes you want to eat and then to return. Hustling, and bustling with families, businessmen, and tourists the Cantonese oriented menu and staff caters to all appetites from small (get the spring roll) to large (a whole roast duck is a start). Be guided by the staff who treat you as family and ignore their suggestions at your peril!An experience not to be missed!

It had been 10 years plus since my last visit to this city and a meal here was a memorable one all that time ago. I was again back in Singapore recently and was taken back here. The decor is simple and some have described it a bit basic. It is however the food that makes this place really worth finding. Service is friendly but perhaps rushed but prices are inexpensive so they do need to turn the tables. 5 of us with plenty of drinks ate well for circa $150 so not bad.We had some great food, a tangy and crispy Sweet and Sour Pork, the Black Pepper Beef was succulent and full of flavour but a great dish and well worth the round trip was the Claypot Pigs Liver. Outstanding tender liver with a lovely pungent ginger flavour and really good balanced seasoning. Beautiful baby pak choi with garlic and ginger made it all very enjoyable. Very accomplished cooking and as the tables filled up there was a great buzz to the place. It was great to sit out on the street and enjoy the bustling atmosphere.Well worth the 10 year wait to reacquaint myself and would rush back tomorrow..

This is a modest traditional joint with large portions and reasonable prices. The food is good. We sat i. A table outdoors enjoying the atmosphere. Only issue is that we felt a bit pressured to leave our table as we finished which marred a bit the experience
5
A pilgrimage to see Fatty in the heart of Singapore is a must for any true food lover. Whether your dish comes from the land, sea or air Fatty pays respect to the integrity of the meat in creating culinary sensations. The jewel in Fattys' crown is definitely the chili crab. Fatty is unrepentant in both portion size, genorsity and flavour in creating the most brilliant crustacean dish you will try. The crab meat is plump and tastey and the chili sauce has a beautiful texture and sits over the crab like a snow capped mountain. Another classic Fatty's staple is the duck. Juicey on the inside, crackling on the outer skin Fatty's beautifully crafts his poultry dishes with wholesome flavours accompained by a lovely light and refreshing cucumber condiment. Along with a couple of Tiger beers, sitting at Fatty's is not just lunch or dinner but an unforgettable dining experience. Thanks to the gracious and forever - pleasing staff and look forward to getting my next Fatty's feed soon!!!!
4
Had a fantastic meal with my family here in August 2014. The service is great and the food comes out at pace - no hanging around!! Word of advice - unless there are more than 4 of you sharing the dishes, don't bother ordering large portions as the medium ones are just fine!Great value and great evening - thank you
5
Been going here for years - consistent good food, quick service, good prices and flexible policy re wine (they don't serve it so bring your own!).Highly recommended - go early as it's always packed.Try the Salted prawns, Indonesian Chicken (Claypot Chicken), Sweet and Sour Pork or Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice, Don Miao (sp? Greens with garlic), and the Barbecue Pork is divine!Great casual, value for money dining in Singapore!Tip - they give a wet towel (chargable) but no napkins so take some with you - especially if you having the chilli crab!
4
Was recommended this restaurant by several friends. Very tasty Chinese food. Huge plates and very reasonably priced. With all the road works going on bencoolen it might be easier to get a taxi there. Definitely worth a visit.
5
We ate here every night. The food was delicious and affordable. It can be hard to get a table, you are best to book or you may have to wait for a table, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.
4
Found Fatty's on my first night and went back a few more times
Cheap, good food, local atmosphere
Would recommend
5
I live around the corner from Fatty's and it is excellent. The food is delicious and it is great value. You can also BYO wine. Try the nuclear chicken
5
Decided to try Fatty's as it always looked busy. Went back twice. Food was so tasty and not bad priced at all. We shared three small dishes between two of us and definitely had enough to feel full. Love the fresh lime juice. Wish I had been more adventurous with picking the dishes but maybe next time. I have heard the chilli crab is the best
5
We miss this restaurant now that we're home! It was our favourite place to eat dinner when we stayed at the Ibis Bencoolen St. So easy to find - from front doors of the hotel turn right. Walk to the traffic lights to cross the road. Walk straight ahead into the pedestrian area between Burlington Sq and Sim Lim building. Wing Seong Fatty's is on the left where the outdoor tables are. The food is delicious and the service we found to be always efficient, even when almost every outdoor table was taken. On sitting down, staff were soon over to take our order and we could relax with a Tiger beer and enjoy watching the local bustle. We thought the servings were generous and whatever we ordered we finished off - it's that good. Food is available in small, medium and, if I remember correctly, large servings, so it's easy to keep within a budget. On each occasion we did not have any trouble getting a table, but we went quite early on in the evening. We never felt pressured to leave afterwards even when more diners arrived
5
I don't have the habit of writing reviews for local restaurants, but I felt that I would be doing a grave injustice to Wing Seong Fatty's Restaurant if I had not written.Few weeks back, I made a table reservation for 12 persons to celebrate my dear mum's 73rd birthday at Wing Seong Fatty's for lunch. This is after I read the previous good reviews from Tripadvisor as well as I went down personally on 1 occasion to try out the food myself.Restaurant during lunch time was relatively crowded, though I had witnessed before that their dinner night time was far more crowded. Based on the recommendations from the restaurant boss, we ordered crabs, prawns, scallops, pork ribs, duck, roasted chicken, omelette, pomfret, vegetables, and "longevity noodles". Coming from a typical fussy-about-food Singaporean family group, all of us agreed that the food they serve are all very fresh. All of us enjoyed the tasty food they prepared for us. And the best part is the price is most reasonable and definately not cut-throat prices. The boss even kindly allowed us to bring our own cakes, pastries and champagne at no extra charge!!Thanks to Wing Seong Fatty's Restaurant for making my mum's birthday lunch experience such a memorable one for all of us..
4
a small chinese eating house in burlington square,it is busy at night. i arrive at the restaurant around 8 pm.and nearly all the table are occupied. the staff who take our order is very nice he recommends that we should have small size dishes because we order 4dishes for two. the foods are home style cooking and very delicious. the price is surprisingly cheap consider that this is singapore,an expensive city
4
Good old Cantonese taste never goes away. I used to patronage this place when I was living in Singapore. Many years later, they are still standing tall. A simple restaurant near Rochor who has lived through the years. I remembered they were across the street at FuLuShou and later moved to where they are today.Environment: Simple local restaurant. Down-to-earth. Clean.Service: Very personal. Family-run business with the passion of food perfection.Location: In the middle of a lot of crowd and buzz. Walking distance to SimLim, IT mall.Food: Exceptionally good. Home-cooked taste. Try the fish head noodle.Price: Great value for money.Not to be missed
5
Was recommended by a Qantas pilot friend - and when you read the story about the original Fatty you will understand the connection. Fatty smuggled food to POWs during the Japanese occupation. Many of the POWs were Australian, and after the war would come back to Singapore and patronise this restaurant - some were Qantas pilots on regular stopovers, and hence the Qantas tradition.The food comes out in great quantities - so may be as well to 'under order'. Huge prawns, spring rolls that are 2 or 3 times the size that you get at home. And a mixed plate of duck and pork was all meat !Make no mistake that the food served is the European/Chinese that you probably get at home, but the quality and quantity make it an excellent meal
5
I just actually stumbled upon this restaurant since it was just beside the hotel we were staying at. It was famous because it is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Singapore specializing in Cantonese cuisine. Looking at the menu, i saw a lot of dishes i was already familiar with and some new ones as well. Tried the salted fish and chicken fried rice, chicken with cashew nuts, and the famous meat roll. The fried rice was a bit salty for my taste but it was distinctly flavorful and makes you want to eat more. the chicken dish is something i always order even back home in the Philippines, but the Wing Seong Fatty version has more chunks of chicken and more veggies and more cashew nuts. But the best dish was the meat roll. Back home, we have a similar dish which we call "KIKIAM", but the Wing Seong Fatty version is more flavorful, fresher, not dry, the skin is crispy and the filling moist, fresh, yummy! all the food were served piping hot, and fast. The staff were also very kind, even though most of them were old people, didn't have a problem talking to them and asking about the menu. The place was a bit old and decor was dated but i like it that way since it shows that this restaurant has been operating for several years already, and that it has its old fashion charm. its cozy and not too flashy as some restaurants can be. Besides the food was so amazingly good, i wouldn't mind if they serve it outside under a tree. Menu prices can be a bit more compared to hawker food, or even fast food items...but the serving size is big. I think the small sized order is good for 2-3 people. So if you are coming to Singapore along Bencoolen area, it is a must to eat here. Really worth the trip and the money you would spend on it
5
After living in Singapore for many years, it was my first time to dine at Fatty's restaurant tonight. I was brought over to this nice place by a friend with fishing hobby. The chef cooked his big catch fish into three type of delicious dishes, fish in blackbean sauce, fish masak asam, and fish with eggplant. Best taste for local Singaporean food, a must-try for first timer like me and return visit like future me to try their other special dishes
5
I have been coming to Fatty's for decades. I went again last night and was served by Skinny, the late Fatty's son. Had the Indonesian prawn, salt and pepper squid, sweet and sour pork and beef with ginger. All piping hot and incredibly tasty. Love this place
5
I first visited the original Fatty's in 1974 while,serving in the military, and was amazed to find the company still trading 40 years on. True the original building has gone, thanks to city redevelopment, but this is still in Albert Street and still a street style restaurant.Clientele were a mix of locals and tourists,during our visit and the food straightforward (and excellent) Chinese fare. We had Chilli Crab, which while hot and spicy was not overly so, and extremely tasty. Be prepared to be messy if you chose this dish however! This with bread and beer came to a reasonable ( for Singapore) S$ 58.Highly recommended
5
I'd eaten at Fatty's thirty years before and whilst it took some finding it was well worth it. The service was excellent......immediate attention. The menu is limited but all the food is down to earth, well cooked, tasty and well presented. Here, as with other food halls you get feel for the country. Why spend a fortune on tablecloths and tarted up international menus when you can get the authentic feel for a country for a fraction of the price

We were staying at the Ibis on Bencoolen, and decided to look on Trip Advisor for nearby restaurants that we hadnâ€™t already seen or tried. We were surprised to find that Fattys was shown as being on the other side of Bencoolen Street to our hotel, however it was not there. The mystery was solved when we walked to the top of Bencoolen, and found the restaurant on a pedestrian area the other side of a small shopping mall.Having found it, we had to wait ten minutes or so for a vacant table. There are a number of tables inside, but the majority are outside in the pedestrian area. We were outside, which was great for people watching, and thankfully it did not rain. We found the menu was more like a Chinese restaurant in England, compared to some of the local Chinese restaurants we had already eaten in. It was also noticeable that there were many tourists or expats among the customers.The food was good, and together with several beers for my husband, the total bill was about 70 SGD
4
We had dinner at Wing Seong's. We ordered a chilli crab (1 crab - bout 2-3 pieces each), salted egg fried prawns, yang chow fried rice and stir fry broccoli and a bottle of beer. This came up to about SGD90.00. The crab itself was priced at SGD 48 per kg. Service was excellent and the dishes were tasty. The only one thing we noticed was that the crab had a slight bitter after taste. Other then that it was a satisfying meal. The place was a bit crowded at 8 plus and we waited for about 15 mins for a table.

Singapore is a place country of mixed cultures, religion and wealth, however it is good to see that even in the cosmopolitan - high flying, money making world, some business are still realistic and down to earth (and presumably profit making)Believed to be still owned and run by a local family its an up market hawker stall with very sensible prices. The service is second to non even though some of the waiters English is limited - as their are old school local Singaporeans - it so nice to pleasant to meet and communicate with them. What is requested - is actually rebuffed by the it the staff think you are over ordering and what is ordered arrives - in this world so refreshing.There is no wine, but plenty of beer, but you can take your own wine or buy next door (inflated) from the 'offie'.Great for a reasonably priced get together with no airs and graces, and a good place to take tourists and visitorsthe extensive meanu if you un
5
Based on Trip advisor reviews went to Fatty's.Only two of us so not many choices. had the Indonesian prawns, kaland with oyster sauce, the peeper beef, and to cap it off a chilli crab. All arrived with unbelievable alacrity. These guys know their stuff!Will definitely be back
5
We ate here twice in Decmber 2013, the second time to show our improved Singaporean table manners. The food and the service were great both times and if we are ever lucky enough to return to Singapore we will certainly eat there again. Thanks to the staff who were very patient with us ;
5
Great food, seated quickly, ordered quickly and meal brought to us with care. Pricing was good for 6 people.
5
Fabulous King Prawns, luscious noodles, pepper beef and and and. Everything in this place is authentic, delicious, hot and happily and speedily served up. Skinny showed up to close the place that has been around for eons.
3
For non-asians, this chinese joint rates high but I think its just another restaurant. **Warning moist towelette and tea are not free.
As for the food, the taste is average. Service and location is great.
4
Been planning to visit Alberts restaurant for sometime and finally made with my family. Very good service by the two ladies and food was fantastic especially the chilly crab. Try the crispy bun along with it.
3
After having heard and read so much about the place, I decided to try it out. It was good.... not the best but good, homely Chinese food.
I tried some Roast Duck, Chilli Prawns and some Black Pepper Venison.
4
My wife and I came here on a late Monday evening as it was right down the block from our hotel room. Good service, very attentive and willing to provide recommendations with a smile. Cross over between casual/street food dining + more of a sit down restaurant. Ate dinner around 930 p.m. and there was a good amount of people eating still.Very good dishes - ordered the black pepper beef, sweet & sour pork, and prawns with barley. All delicious - a bit too fried and could have used some more vegetables (although I certainly could have ordered a veggie dish). 3 "small" dishes with rice was ample amount of food for 2 people (and both of us can both eat quite a bit!). A bit on the expensive side ($40 for 3 "small dishes, white rice, and tea) compared to other local eateries
4
takes a while to get a table, very crowded, busy, and looks that ppl really want to eat in this resto. Very good services from the beginning the way they treat us, help us to chose food in menu, and when one of my chopstick fell, very fast response, its not necesarry i ask for the new one! when I turned to the waiter, it found out they already have on my side with a new chopsticks!
5
We rather doubted the previous reviews, but Fatty's is pure Chinese magic. No frills - just the best food out and at sensible prices in a city that generally threatens to break the bank! Sit outside and soak up the atmosphere as the busy staff fly from table to table producing superb meals at astonishing No sooner has one waiter delivered the Tiger Beer so the meal arrives and the real delights start. Mouth watering duck, succulent prawns, perfect vegetables .. Need I say more?The address of 175 Bencoolen St is a bit misleading. Cross Bencoolen at the pedestrian way at the end of Albert St - 50 metres on left into the square and Fatty's awaits. Please don't miss it! A real gem
5
Fatty's is THE BEST restaurant in Singapore. I have been there many times over 10 years and it simply does not change. No, it's not fine dining, no, it doesn't have a menu a mile long, no, it is not typical Asian street food. It's just brilliantly cooked, wholesome Asian mixtures targeted at Westerners. It's everything you would like your local Chinese to be. The Black Pepper Prawns are legendary and are sooooo fresh and sooo juicy and soooo perfectly cooked. I have asked for the recipe a number of times over the years and have tried to re-create them at home, but I just have to keep coming back. These are prawns that you dream about in your sleep. The Chilli Squid, the duck, the fried rice, sizzling beef, are all magic. Sitting back on a humid night knocking back a tiger beer in the middle of the Sim Lim buzz is just an experience you will never forget. For the quality and freshness of food, the price is fantastic. Yes, you may have to wait a little longer when it is busy, but that's the sacrifice you make for quality
5
We visited here with my father-in-law as a family meal out with big appetites and quick service. We had the Indonesian Prawn Curry, Black Pepper Crab, Chicken Fried Rice and several other dishes . The service was fantastic and quick and the cleanliness was also Spore standard. This place is great for families and the portions of rice are great. Beer is available to those wishing to have a drink with your meal. A must try
4
Pleasant food. The duck was very tasty. Next I will go for the crab which unfortunately is regularly sold out....
5
It doesn't look much on the outside, but the food is excellent and really good value. We paid twice as much for half the food and not as good in Boat Quay the night before. High recommended.
4
Arrived 15mins before closing and staff couldn't have been more welcoming. Went for the chilli crab and wasn't disappointed! Other meals ordered were just as tasty. Fantastic service even offered suggestions. Would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore looking for no frills tasty food.
5
Our favourite for local food in Singapore. No nonsense prices, no waiting for service.
Ideal for inviting friends during their first Singapore visit.

This is the best Chinese meal I ever tasted. And not expensive at all. Very friendly staff including Skinny, the present owner and son of Fatty. My very best recommendations.
1
This restaurant rates rather high in tripadvisor. But once there you will seriously doubt if it serves authentic local fare. The place is filled with 90% foreigners or expats. Service was quick but detached. They seemed more keen to serve their regulars.Food was ok and expensive. About 30% more than most local restaurants in the same category. I think they are more expensive because they are more famous. The food definitely does not meet its reputation. It's too foreignised Chinese food
5
We went to fatty's on recondition on trip advisor, and weren't disappointed we asked the manager what she would recommend as there were six of us so we could all try a bit of what she recommended we had spring rolls, Indonesian curry, chilli crab, bok choi, sweet and sour, pork crispy beef, prawns, chicken fried rice, and it was excellent a must do if you are in Singapore
5
Return visit. Excellent as before. Friendly, informed and efficient service for a good price. The spring roll starter is good for the taste buds. Any of the prawns excel and I am particularly partial to the chilli chicken. The large bottles of beer at 660 ml are good value. Will return next trip
5
Had two meals at Wing Seong Fatty's on my last visit to Singapore to see my son who lives there. Food was super as was the atmosphere. A very casual place, but great fun. If you fancy wine instead of the beer they have, you're welcome to visit a store nearby and bring wine back with you
4
I was afraid to find a place packed with tourists as its often the case with tripadvisor restaurants, but here there were mainly locals and thats always a guarantee of authenticity. Food was great, real chinese, specially duck, noodles and pork. Not a very romantic place, but a great address indeed
4
Great little eatery, not too expensive, good food, big portions, friendly staff, clean and comfortable.
4
Good food, decent prices, fast service. Relatively cheap beers.
Opening quite late, 4-5 pm afternoon.
If you're only couple and coming late (9-10 pm), you might find yourself sharing a table with other people since they have mostly large round tables.
5
If you want nice well prepared food with good service Eat at Fatty's if you want cheap food with out service eat at a street stall.
4
Recommended to us by expats who had lived here for many years. Good food and good local beer. Service is functional and adequate and we were not in any hurry anyway. Orders come out really hot and fresh from a busy kitchen. Very popular and long established
3
As an older lady by herself, I was a bit hesitant about coming here, having read previous reviews about how grumpy the owners can be! I was made to feel very welcome, and enjoyed my meal. No Peking Duck the night I went, but the owner made a few alternate suggestions, which was helpful. The food is tasty, with large portions, and not at all expensive. Wouldn't say it was anything special, but still nice
5
Think of the vest street food or Hawker food in Singapore. Add to it the brilliance of a Cantonese chef who knows what he is doing and helpful informed staff and you have it - Fatty's in Albert street. Just delicious freshly cooked from fresh ingredients served with a smile on no nonsense tables and chairs in the market area of Albert Street. Just a must visit for foodies
3
...read about this restaurant in an Australian newspaper regarding this restaurant being a favourite for Qantas pilots...so it must be great I thought.Heading downstairs from Swissotel (the Stamford)...coincidentally, a Qantas pilot enters the lift and I ask him whether Qantas pilots do eat at the restaurant. He says he was there the night before and provides two recommended dishes (Back Pepper Crab and Chicken Clay Hot Pot).The restaurant is located in a large lane way off Bencoolen St (opp Electronics Mall).We found that service was lacking...order was taken by a person (utilising only their memory) and not all the dishes we ordered arrived. We had to wait quite sometime for drinks etc.Overall the food was very good (in particular the Chicken Clay Hot Pot was sensational)...did not order the Crab though.Reasonably priced restaurant as well (including the beer!
4
Fatty's is a great local food stop. Don't expect quality furniture, awesome decor or a high quality building. Do expect high quality food in a traditional open fronted, white tiled, open to the street location. Grab a table outside, order and watch the World go by. I love it and it has been used by many long haul pilots - especially Qantas - for a great night out for 30+ years. And, in my experience, if airline crews go there it is generally fun, good and cheap. Fatty's is all of the above. What is also fantastic - and this is no joke - Fatty has retired and the restaurant is now run by his son - his name, Thinny! Ask for him and he will come and say hi
4
I was brought here about 9 years ago and have been coming here ever since.The food is absolutely great! Try the Black pepper prawns, you can't go wrong.The same staff has been here since that 1st visit.They are very efficient and helpful.I always eat outside but the inside is air conditioned if you prefer.Crowd is both locals and visitors ( mostly airline crews).The Tiger beer is ice cold.Prawns, garlic spinach , and a cold beer and you have yourself a fantastic meal.You won't pay a fortune either.Please try it
5
worth hunting this little diamond out for no frills but amazing Chinese food. My parents came here nearly twenty years ago when it was in the old building and have a photo with Fatty and his wife, when my Mum and I came back we spoke to Skinny about our last visit. Such lovely people! Food is second to none-I always come here when in Singapore
4
The restaurant was a little difficult to find but in the end definitely worth the effort. The food was excellent, there was plenty of choice and the price was quite reasonable. For a drink I recommend the lime juice.
5
We have heard about this restaurang before leaving Sweden as the best restaurang cooking cantonese food in Singapore. We went there and choised sweet and soursliced fish and duck from the menu. Just delicate!!!! A 5 star restaurang in the middle of nowhere.
3
Yummy chinese but they charge Australian prices when vendors at the street stalls less than 100 meters away charge a third of the price. We are not all on Qantas pilot wages.
3
Good local food but I've found everywhere I've stopped to eat in Singapore has good local food. I wouldn't go out of your way to seek and find Fatty's as I did but if you're in the area then go for it!
4
I say ask for Skinny because he is the son of "Fatty" - who started this restaurant. It has moved a few blocks - it used to be in the Albert court - but has some of the best Chinese fusion cuisine in Singapore. Good food, good value. I took 37 people here for $12.00 per person. The draw back they only have the large size tiger beer. (How unfortunate?
4
Food is traditional shall I say signature Singaporean Cantonese of good quality.Roast meats, and fried noodles are of good standard. Flavors are tweaked for western palettes. A good example of the old "coffee-shop" eatery. Good place to watch Singaporean crowds.Outdoor seating comfortable only in evenings, and only with copious amounts of cold beer.Prices and portions are fair. Service is good Singapore standard
1
I ordered a plate of ee mee, Hor fun and home made bean curd. The Hor fun was ok, had that burnt flavour. As for the rest, the worst was the ee mee, totally bland and tasteless. Bean curd was nothing to shout about. I ate there a couple of years back and remembered the food was pretty good. However as of now the food quality has gone down a lot. Pretty expensive meal too for just 3 dishes and 2 cokes. Sgd 25 bucks. Probably will not visit again
5
We stayed in one of the hotels in Middle Road, and looked for a good restaurant to have a super late lunch or early dinner nearby. So we found this Wing Seong Fatty's from TripAdvisor and went there. We arrived in the place around 5pm and their table had been fully booked and occupied! I thought this must be good, and it is! We ordered Salted Fish Fried Rice, Chilli Prawn, Fried Kwey Tiao and Pork Spare Ribs. All is GOOD! The food came impossibly fast, and the auntie and the uncle who run the place were quite friendly too eventhough there was a language barrier. P.S: The people who run the place will look quite impatient and not friendly, I would suggest you to not take it personally, that's just the way they are. Keep asking and keep talking, they'd finally ease up on you ;)

Fatty's is "famous" because it was frequented by Qantas Airways pilots. As Australians visiting Singapore, I wanted to see what all the fuss is about following a story in Sydney's daily broadsheet about QF pilots eating there. If the pilots have the same food as the rest of us, then we're all eating very ordinary food. Fried rice, noodles, prawns etc were nothing special. Sure, service was fast but I'd have been happier for slower service and better food. Price-wise, reasonably cheap. Atmosphere, nothing particularly interesting happening around the place. Night markets full of cheap uninteresting souvenirs and un-engaging stall sellers. Wouldn't go again.
5
After reading a very positive Sydney Morning Herald article based on Qantas aircrew patronage of Fatty's - my wife and I thought we would give it a try during a recent holiday in Singapore. We weren't disappointed. Fried rice, chili prawn and two Tigers later - we left Fatty's very happy with the experience. Food was top notch - delivered quickly and with no fuss; however the staff were very helpful and friendly in a low-key sort of way. We sat outside in about 27c watching the world go by...could it get any better? Well worth checking out....we'll certainly return. Very happy with the experience
4
been here a number of times and always left very full & satisfied. i love their yang chow rice and fried hongkong kailan. price a bit high but the portion is big and very tasty, really worth it.
5
Food is always excellent. Very laid back place that serves authentic food at good prices and serves Tsingtao beer.
4
While the chili crab is good, it's not really exceptional, had fried rice also, portion is quite big, easily for two person.
5
We had black pepper beef, chilli prawn, butter crab and fried rice(Yang Zhou style). Crab was not very generous in termd of portion but every menu was finger licking good. Fried rice was the second best in my life. Three persons spent 99SD and all were happily full. Definite worth visitin
5
Spent six weeks in Singapore and visited various Chinese restaurants but none came close to this one. The service can be blunt at times but the food comes quick every time and is always incredible. By far the nicest sweet and sour chicken I've ever had and very nice peppered beef and also the fried rice.The choice of small, medium and large portion sizes is very good also, although the small is a reasonable portion so be warned.Would definitely recommend a visit here, although it can get busy quickly, we arrived 5 minutes after opening one day and there was already 4 or 5 tables already in and by 45 minutes later it was practically full.Prices are very reasonable as well, one night four of us visited and left very full, including a large beer and sodas all for 85sgd
5
What a great pleace! Been in Singapore many times, but find this place just this year. Fantasic food, great people and absolutely generous portions of every food! Not like here in Australia - huge plates and somthing small in the midle.Here you just see the food and no plate!And price will let you wonder how they can do it. Just small example - 1/2 half roasted Peking duck will cost you$18 Sing! So thank you to all staff at Fetties now runing by Skini for grat food and time in yor place
2
I've been going to Fatty's for the past 2 years, and the food is both delicious and cheap. They even cook off the menu for you (salted-egg chicken, absolute yum)!However, I went there last night and it was absolute chaos. There were so many people, our table was placed far off the restaurant already. The servers were rude and you had to order quickly or else they show that they're losing patience. The food still came fast, but the quality was not like it used to be.I feel like after Anthony Bourdain reviewed it, so many people discovered it, and just ruined it for the usuals like me. :
5
This is a restaurant that is very easy to miss if you haven't been here before or have been told about it. Being a semi-regular visitor to Singapore I never visit without coming to Fattys for a meal. The food is amazing, and is renound amongst airline crews from all over the world.I highly recommend:-Spring roll-Chicken hot pot (a must try!)-Mongolian beef-Black pepper prawns-Fried riceYou will not be dissapointed
4
I must say that being a cantonese myself, and having lived in HK and now in NYC, i come to Singapore often and want to eat Chili crabs.. Well, this is the place to do it. That being said, besides Chili crabs and great cold beer to go along with it, and friendly service.. There's nothing else thats really spectacular about this place.. You pay what you get.. Maybe i'm biased because of my HK experience.. Don't get me wrong, it was a great meal... But i've had lots of other great local fare in Singapore as well! Anyway, not a bad place
4
Fatty's is a great experience in local Singapore food & service! Fatty has passed away but the restaurant is now run by his son, Skinny (not a joke!). This is a locally owned restaurant and the atmosphere is VERY relaxed and casual. The restaurant itself is not the most appealing but the food is delicious and the bathroom is clean. Eat outside as it can get loud inside. We have eaten there several times so we would recommend the black pepper prawns and the cashew chicken dish. Order a few dishes and share around the table. Bring your own napkins (as you should do in all local Singaporean eateries). One of the servers, Amy, is an institution there and will give you excellent service (great memory)...recommending portion sizes for you. They serve beer in the large bottles and it's very cheap (no wine). When you are done, you lay the bottles next to your table and, after the meal, they count the bottles to calculate the bill. The rumor has it that Fatty used to, at his own risk, sneak foor to the captured soldiers during the war. Many of whom were Australian pilots and so now you will see a lot of Australian airline crew there. Check out the story when you are there. Highly recommend
5
Read the previous reviews and as we are staying just around the corner, thought we would give it ago, definitely lived up to all the positive comments and my husband got his Chilli Crab. Great place
5
We went here every second night and once for lunch when our racehorse back in New Zealand had a good win. The food and service is amazing.
4
Singapore can be ferociously expensive, but look around and you find little gems like Fatty's.
Substantial meals from $5S, very tasty and beer not too expensive.
Give it a try!
5
QANTAS staff and flight crew have been regulars for at least 35 years that I know of. Qantas people a generally in the know and tight arses, so it must be and is good.
4
This restaurant gets a good reviews on trip advisor for good reason. We read about it and as we were staying at the Ibis Hotel on Bencoolan we went looking for it. It's not actually on Bencoolan Street but just set back off the road in a thorough fare. You can't miss the Fattys sign.The meals were quick, fresh and tasty. A few people had the Chilli crab and we're racing about it. We had several meals and all were delicious.This is a tried and tested trip advisor restaurant so try it for yourself. We loved it.
5
We were staying at the Ibis and after discovering Fattys just around the corner and with excellent reviews decided why not give it a go. Do yourselves a favour and stop here for a meal, don't be put off by the look not the fanciest restaurant around but the food certainly makes up for as it was the best meal we had whilst in Singapore. Large Bintang, Chicken & Garlic (definitely heaps of garlic), 1/2 crispy duck and small rice all up $S38, best crispy duck we have eaten. This restaurant gets very busy so the best thing to do is eat early ie before 6.00pm or later on probably around 8'ish. You can't go wrong eating at Fatty's
5
I arrived into Singapore yesterday afternoon and checked into the Ibis on Bencoolen. Just round the corner for dinner was Fatty's Restaurant. I'd been here in December with my wife and the chilli Crab then was so good I just had to return last night.The Tiger Beer was cold and the Chilli Crab was excellen
5
Add my name to the list of pleased travelers who made the effort to get to Fatty's and, yes, his son Skinny is still there greeting guests. Fancy, no but wonderful food at a fair price, yes. I had the Black Pepper Crab because when in Singapore you have have crab at least one night...even if the only way you can attack it is with your fingers. Messy yes, but worth the effort. And as many other reviewers have said their pork fried rice is "to die for". I took the MRT to the Bugis stop and walked 3 or 4 blocks to Sim Lim Square where Fatty's is located (hint...ask locals to direct you to Sim Lim Square if you loose your direction...they know where it is on the crooked neighborhood streets)

Surprisingly good.The restaurant came with a quite a history apparently,but we didn't ask much about it.We were astonished by how bad the kebabs at the next door actually. We intended to swear off that stretch of restaurants actually,but we were too hungry the next day and did not want to go for junk food and we were too late for other options. As soon as the food came, the simple looking dishes just exploded with flavours on our taste buds.Not too many locals were spotted there,but perhaps it was too late. But we did see many westerners sitting around the tables on the outside having food and beers, both young and elderly.Food prices are a little on the high side though, but it's worth every penny paid. This gauge is made with comparison to some of the other local delicacies in the vicinity.Staff is very friendly with a local touch too by recommending some of their house specialties. Be sure to try their "Special Braised Toufu". Too awesome to be missed. I cannot remember exactly what time they start operations in the morning, but they do have split shift and stop at around 2pm, and reopens for dinner at 5.15pm till 10.15pm, as it says on the glass door
5
Been going to Fattys for years, parents first took me in 70's!! Location has changed a few times over years but present location handy for most downtown hotels. Staff always busy but actually helpful..... Even though old guy always looks miserable!! Sat outside watching world go by with big cold Tiger beer and chilli prawns can not be beaten!
5
I will definitely go to this restaurant every time I am in Singapore. Delicious food...especially the BBQ pork. They are a bit pushy getting you to order, but that is overlooked because the food is so good. Reasonably priced too! Loved it!
5
This place was fantastic. The food was absolutely brilliant.
The place needs a make over, don't let the dated and faded look put you off the best food in town.
5
singapore is inundated with good restaurants to eat in and "fattys" fits into that class. the food was fresh,tasty and such good value for money.
5
Every time I visit Singapore I must have a black pepper crab at Fatty's! The food is simple, flavoursome and cheap. Do something daring for a change and try the frog - it is seriously excellent! Don't expect a flash restaurant with fine dining, just expect brilliant tasty food with a truly modest price tag. Been coming here for 12 years and it has never let me down
5
I was introduced to Fatty's by an Australian ex-pat and good friend and colleague living in Singapore. On every visit to Singapore for business, I now always end up at Fatty's with a group of associates and friends. The location on the plaza of Sim Lim Square provides good outdoor seating under the trees. The tables accommodate small or large groups, and the staff of Fatty's are attentive and on the spot to get you seated. I would recommend anything on the menu, but my favorites are Mongolian Prawns, Black Pepper Beef, any fried rice, and the clay pot curry chicken. The lime juice if cold and fresh and the beer is certainly better at Fatty's with friends. Take the time to find yourself eating here
4
I've been coming to Singapore for work for years and like to stay at the Ibis Bencoolen due to it's location. Fatty's is right across the street and I've walked by it hundreds of times until I finally was intrigued enough to try it. I've been going back ever since. I like to sit outside and people watch as hordes of people pass by at any given time. I typically order the fried chicken with dried chiles which is quite good. The staff is friendly and will make you something that's not on the menu if you ask. The other plus is you can get a large bottle of beer for $6.50 SD which is cheap by Singapore standards. I come back enough now that the staff remembers me which is always nice
5
I had some friends from Indonesia (Bali) we went shopping at the OG Albert and later we cross to the other side to have our dinner at Wing Seong Fatty restaurant, we order Chilly Crab, Brocolli with Mushroom, Asam Fish, Deep Fried Chicken, Fried Beancurd , the food was really delicious.The service from the staff was very good and friendly and warm. I cannot beleive there were 9 of us and when we ask for the bill it came to $250.60 which share among ourself which was about $28 per personThe next time if you are in that area at Albert Complex than I would strongly recommend that you try out at this restaurant if you want good food and value for your money. Mr William So
4
Ate inside however outside I think is better as large under cover area and fans so relatively cool. Staff are friendly and food is what you would expect from Kampung food, heaps of locals and expatriates so good mix.BYO wine which is always a bonus and beer available which is also a bonus.We had about 6 dishes and a few beers and price was a little over S$ 120.00 for four of us so ppricing is really good.Little difficult to find as not on road and on the side street wich is the walking mall, as you are coming to Burlington Square turn right before the water fountain and walk up the mall and it is on your left.Staff are good and friendly.Definetely go there agai
5
Fantastic fusion food, with Singaporean, Indonesean, Chinese and Malayan influences. Fast food at its best with a wide range of choice (including frogs legs if you want). Staff helpful in selecting your food, most locals appear to eat inside and the tourists outside. Stumbled on this by chance but what a find
5
I had read about this restaurant here at Trip Advisor; in preparation for our trip to Singapore as we were staying at the Hotel Ibis at Bencoolen, which is just across the building where Wing Seong Fatty's is located. It was a Sunday night and we immediately noticed the number of locals and tourists who were already having dinner. Fortunatly, a group had just left and we were able to secure a table. We had Roasted Duck, Fried Bean Curd with Crabmeat, and Fried Sea Bass in sweet & sour sauce. Everything was delicious and the old lady who was waiting on us was very charming and helpful. The dishes come in different sizes and since we were just two (my daughter already ate), we had to order the smallest dish. It still was a lot for us and except for the fish, it only cost S$12 each. If you are in the Bugis area, you should plan to eat at this restaurant; if you want to have a local experience
4
Each time I come here, its the same attentive service, and good food. Enjoyed the black pepper prawns, the tall Tiger beers, and the fairly cool evening following a heavy rain. You won't be disappointed. FedEx pilots come here a lot as well.
3
needed a snack so stopped at fattys. old man tried to sell us a full banquet. still ended up paying $70 for dinner. lovely food though and must needed cold beer. however, 10yds away and you had food on skewers for $2 each.
5
Just the best Chinese food ever, anywhere and they never fail to deliver. Calvin, skinny and Emmy are great hosts and the food is just brill. They look after our girls and always treat them on CNY.
The best !
5
Fattys was a real eye opener. Plastics tables, plastic plates, chopsticks and the most amazing food, they don't serve wine however happy for u to buy it from the bar next door and bring to your table!! A BYO Singapore style!! Salted prawns a must and noodles with shredded duck simply sublime..... Four of us ate for $60! Whereas the two cocktails at Raffles cost us the same!!
4
Got a tip from a friend at home about this place. Apparently Qantas pilots visit here when in Singapore. I was told the food was great, so we thought it worth giving it a shot. We weren't disappointed! The food was so tasty, the staff very friendly and the meal very affordable. Highly recommend you visit, I will be back next time I visit Singapore
5
I can echo other reviews of this excellent restaurant. If you walked past it without knowing anything about it, you would carry on walking past. But you should stop and go in for a meal. Their orange chicken is to die for! Plastic plates and basic amenties but the food is the best. Go down Bencoolen street until you see Burger King on the left. Go into the square and you will find this gem on the left
4
This is a firm favourite of mine when visiting Singapore. It's got an indoor dining space and a large outdoor space. The table and chairs are plastic and the decor is basic but the food is absolutely fantastic and as you would imagine, very reasonable. I love sitting outside and just watching the world go by. This place is good at anytime of day, wether you're alone, in a couple or part of a crowd! If you have the time I would recommend a visit. Many restaurants on here aren't deserving of their ranking but this one definitely is
5
What a gem in the middle of a busy singapore shopping street service excellent speedy and friendly the food great and so cheap would certainly recommend a visit we were staying very close in the ibis bencoolen street and we ate there every night of our holiday as it was so good. It seems to be a family run business as all the age groups were serving at the tables we managed to get a table outside and it seems to attract every nationality suppose its due to the cheap food but well done as the quality of the food especially the noodles was second to none
5
This man remembered us from the night before and with a flourish set us up at a table within moments of arriving. Before long we were enjoying Singapore's beer and wonderful food under the stars. My vegetarian option was delicious. Easy to get to if you are staying in the Bencoolen area
5
I lived in Singapore in the 60's, after a night out on the Tiger beer, Fatty's stall in Albert St was a must. Fatty was the last stall holder to be forced off the street, and took a shop on Bencoolen St. Unfortunately Fatty died around seven years ago, but his restaurant is still ably run by his children, Skinny does front of house, number ten is a son who does the till, and one of the sisters looks after the restaurant. The best place is a table outside, to watch all the passers by, and join in the banter. A number of aircrews use Fatty's B.A., Qantas,Air France, KLM, they liven up the evening. The food is brilliant, the beer is reasonably priced, staff are great especially Aimee. In the last fifteen years of visiting there we have never seen any drunken brawls, and never been dissatisfied with food quality, or price. Claypot chicken is to die for, as are all the Singapore staples Mee Goreng, Hokkien Mee, and Char Kway Teow
5
We have dined at Fatty's many times oner the years, always excellent service, food and atmosphere. Prices are getting up there, but a lot of things are expensive in Singapore now,
Highly recommend.
4
Overall, we found Fatty's pretty good. The food is a little overpriced compared to a hocka center, but the quality is very good. The location is very close to Sim Lim Square, so good for a lunch visit whilst deciding on things to purchase. We ordered sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice, spring rolls, and beef. All the meat was very tender and nicely cooked; the spring rolls were also quite large and very tasty. However, I wouldn't rave about the food and call it a top quality restaurant. All the dishes we ordered were of the 'small variety' and overall 4 small dishes is a good amount of food between 2 people. Came to roughly $35. Service was quite good with the server attentive
5
Loved it! Great old style Chinese food. The place is nothing out of the ordinary to look at but the food is delicious. Well worth a visit. I think a good sign is when you speak to other guests and find out they are British Airways staff who love the place when in Singapore.
4
I have just dined at Fatty's on my last night in Singapore and was very impressed. Things didn't get off to a great start as I wasn't exactly welcomed warmly (at odds with my experience of the Singaporean people who have been universally helpful, kind and friendly) and was seated in clearly the worst table in the house at the back of the indoor section. A waitress then presented the menu and stood next to my table waiting for me to choose which was slightly off putting and rushing. I went for a large portion of the chilli prawns and when they arrived, they more than compensated for the table and rather average overall service at that point. Absolutely delicious, a generous helping and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to others visiting Singapore
4
Fantastic food, cold beer, prompt service, and street atmosphere - a great combination. Went with two young children for a quick dinner: seafood fried rice, pak choi, sweet & sour pork, tofu with minced beef - heaven. Couple of beers and lemonades - 40 S$Table outsides are literally on the street, very nice in the evening.Next time we are in Singapore and staying nearby - I'll definitely drop by
4
My Australian friends who had lived in Singapore for several years always swore by Fatty's as their favourite and told me to go, go go! I had never been despite many trips to Singapore, but finally went with them in late 2012. The decor and location is nothing special, and Singapore has plenty of fancier places to choose from, but the food was all very nice and came reasonably quickly. Most items were good value.My friend's had not been there for 7 years, and were regulars more like 30 years ago. But "Skinny", who is "Fatty's" son and now run's the place, still was able to pull out their framed picture from about 30 years before! That was impressive. They turned up unannounced after a long, long time, and despite not having much English, the owner knew them and was able to reminisce a bit. That kind of service and history is rare these days
4
We dropped in early at 5.15 and they were actually closed, the lady was lovely and invited us in, no problems, gave us a drink and took order that was lightning fast. We had the pepper prawns and the sweet and sor pork with fried rice and some green veg in garlic. All the food was tasty and the reviews are correct, it would be hard to fault the food and service. Staff very polite and nice.If you want plush surrounds don't come here as is basic decor, but the food makes up for that in spades. Will be back
5
Fatty's has become my favorite Chinese restaurant not only because I live upstairs (literally a few floors above) but because it's the kind of food my family grew up on. The dishes always remind me of weekend dinners out with dad, mum and sis. So it's where I happily drag all my guests, local and foreign. I am a such a regular that I have my own personal "Aunty" waitress who starts writing down my order before the words even leave my mouth. And this is the list she always writes:1) Ku Lou Yoke (Sweet and sour pork - best there is!)2) Dou Miao (Pea shoots in garlic - my godsons fight over these vegetables, a phenomenon that their mom finds amazing)3) Fut Poot (Yam basket filled with chicken, veg and cashews)4) Beef/Deer with ginger and spring onions5) Fish slices with salted egg (owner's recommendation that's not on the menu so ask for it!)6) Steamed fish with spicy celery sauce (Very spicy and a little pricey but extremely satisfying. A special treat whenever my parents are in town)7) Yong Chow Fried RiceAnd my foreign guests are partial to8) Spring Rolls9) Black Pepper Prawns10) Ice cold Tiger Beer (served in ice buckets
5
Avoid the tourist traps and visit Fatty's for real Singapore dining. The food is delicious (must have the black pepper prawns) and tiger beers icy cold. Enjoyed it so much I went back the next night. You don't come here for silver service fine dining - this is the real Singapore away from the tourist traps of orchard rd.
5
This was close to our hotel and we were not disappointed - the food is good and the atmosphere is authentic -the decor and service are basic but friendly. If you want good food without spending all your money this is the place to go to.
5
I love, love, love this place. Black pepper prawns are yummy and they also serve the best sweet n sour pork. If you are nearby or checking out sim lim square this place is a must!

I personally think Fatty's is great food. Prefer to sit outside as there is often a fabulous breeze blowing along the pathway. The prawns are the best, and love the crispy seafood noddles. But a must try is the mushrooms and greens... Delicious. You can buy beer and take along wine. It's an enjoyable experience

I don't think, as one of the user suggested earlier in this thread, that the reports of this place are fabricated. I think the place is just really white-people friendly, and the food is not the most gourmet fare, but it's certainly good. Nice cafe sort of feel (reserve ahead for the better tables), and really good for tourists who are afraid of Asian food. Fried rice was really good, this chinese seasonal vegetable steamed with garlic was SUPERB (forget the name but it looked like a cross between tiny spinach and alfalfa). Fried noodles also great. Beware the LARGE orders. Even if you order a small portion, the serving is bound to be huge. When in doubt, go for smaller order

Been coming here for years and no trip to Singapore is complete without a visit here. The food is simply delicious and very reasonably priced. We love the plastic tables and chairs and the beer is nice and cold, perfect for washing down black pepper crab. Must try dish: deer meat with ginger and spring onions

I chanced upon this place only recently, for lunch. Of course the restaurant has now been revamped and upgraded from what it was more than 40 years ago when I last visited. Then, it was just a roadside stall along another part of Albert St, not too far away from its present location.The food was reasonable and tasty, and based on the crowd, appears to be to the liking of the regular clientele. However my companion who also had memories of this place in the old days, felt that the prices were a tad on the high side.We ordered the plate of combination roast meat, frog legs in clay pot and vegetables fried in garlic. Service was efficient and friendly. Overall, I would recommend this place a visit, if nothing else, just for the old memories

Checking the eating options in the neighborhood of our hotel we came across Fattys and considered it might be worth checking, maybe we could get in there sometime during our stay. As it happened as we perused the menu, a couple of folks were wrapping up and offered us their table, we were in immediately. The menu is quite extensive and it was hard to keep a rein on the possibilities. Chicken in clay pot was excellent would definatelyhave that again. The combination of Char Siew, Roast Pork and Roast Duck was quite acceptible. And small helpings were fine for lunch. Service was efficient and friendly and there was a very eclectic crowd in attendance having a good time. We will definately put Fatty's in our book for a return visit

I went here because of the Trip advisor reports. Don't bother its a con. The service was quick but blunt and the food mediocre at best. Yes, prices were reasonable but not a reason to be scoring so highly on TripAdvisor. I get the distinct impression some of the reports are fabricated to bolster its place on the ratings list

We visited Fatty's after reading the recommendations on Tripadvisor and I'm very pleased that we did! The restaurant is a business that has been looked after by the same family for generations. The food is absolutely delicious and a must try is the black pepper beef and the sweet and sour chicken.Portions were more than plentiful and the service was attentive - the bonus point to this eaterie is that you can sit outside and watch the crowds bustling past. Finally it is extremely good value for money, we visited twice during our stay
5
I love fattys :) when I'm in Singapore I have to go there otherwise my trip is not complete...There's nothing I would recommend in particular, coz everything I had on my few visits was superb!!!!Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and I love the not so touristic street food atmosphere:)Try fattys, you won't leave hungry ;
5
Stumbled upon Fatty's on our first night in Singapore. Best chinese food we have both had and incredibly cheap. Portions are huge so a small is more than enough per person. We returned a few days later and again the food was brilliant. YUM, Will definitely visit if we are ever in that part of the world again
4
Plentiful, cheap dishes served within seconds by a no-nonsense staff in a spartan setting. There's a good chance you'll find yourself sitting next to some pilots or a flight crew -- a sure sign that you've come to a popular hangout.
5
I have been there for over 100 times, it is cool, friendly, relaxed. Food is perfect, prices same like in similar quality restaurants. I think that NO SIGNBOARD in Geylang and Fatty are two best restaurants in Singapore. All dishes are perfect, you ask staff to recommend you something, it is best to ask Fatty or his son ( just ask for boss or boss son ). My favourite dishes are: mussels in oyster sauce, seafood fried rice, corn crab soup, fried mixed vegetables, chicken with cashew nuts, black pepper prawns

I have been coming to this restaurant for the last 40+ years. In the earlier days, it was a stall ("dai pai dong") by the road on the other end of Albert Street (nearer to Selegie Road) where the Albert Hotel is now located. My late grandmother (from Guangdong) and my parents simply loved it. Now, I will take my family there, not for the memories, but because of the quality we know we can expect from it. There are 2 dishes we always order on every occasion: the king ribs ("pai kuat wong") and the fried flat rice noodle ("chow hor fun"). Besides those, the other dishes we have consistently enjoyed include claypot liver ("sar bou ju yern"), the yam basket, the Yangzhou fried rice, sweet and sour pork, the liver rolls ("ngoh hiang"), and the fried chicken. Besides the 2nd generation bosses (children of "Fatty"), you would also be served by two friendly and obliging waitressess, "lai je" and another, who have been there forever. The food and kind service will always bring back memories of happy times gone by spent with granny, mom and dad

Although I live in Singapore and visit Bugis regularly I had not eaten in Fatty's before. Four of us ate lunch there and would definitely highly recommend it. It's a family business with a local feel from the moment you enter. We were not sure what to order and were given excellent advice from our waiter about what might suit us. I am vegetarian and wanted noodles - although veggie noodles are not on the menu they offered to make me some. We didn't have to pre-order rice it just appeared miraculously whenever we asked for it. Cold beer at a reasonable price as well. Overall we had the best food since arriving in Singapore and will be back for more. This is a great place to visit as it isn't touristy and if you are not sure exactly what you might like they are very helpful and willing to make dishes up for you if you ask. Absolutely fantastic

Had a feed here after wandering around SimLim Plaza (it’s directly opposite).Food was OK, service so-so and beer cold, but I can’t really see how this has made it into T/A's top 20 restaurants in Singapore as it really didn’t stand out over a number of similar style places we ate in. A small mud-crab, a couple of meat dishes, some vegetables and three large Tiger beers was just under S$100.Enjoyed a better meal for less at the (very touristy) large seafood place in the middle of Chinatown
4
A 'budget' restaurant with great food at great prices. A no nonsense approach with quick and efficient service. On advise from other reviewers we tried the spring rolls and clay pot chicken which were both fantastic. You can dine in the restaurant or on tables out in the shopping mall and watch an interesting passing parade. Highly recommended for a quick and tasty meal washed down with cold beer- no wine available
5
Ate at Fatty's last night after recommendation from friends and tripadvisor. Came here with high hopes that I'd try some good honest local food and I did not leave disappointed. This family run business has been going strong for three generations. Got chatting with the current owner and it was opened by his grandfather back in 1924 (I believe??). You can really see why it has been going for so long. They take pride in their food and that makes a big difference. The atmosphere is casual with a lively yet family feel to it. I ate the chilli crab (a must), the claypot chicken and the fried frogs legs. I'll admit, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach last night but it had to be done. Each of the dishes were as good as the rest. I would also recommend washing it down with some of their lemon juice. Very refreshing especially on a hot day. It is nice go to to a good honest down to earth restaurant in Singapore. I've eaten here a lot and most of the restaurants I've been too are up market and very expensive. It is good to find a place like fatty's. Its in a good area of town too, if you're visiting I recommend going for a stroll afterwards to see a different side of Singapore
5
My partner and i ate here 3 of the 5 nights we stayed in Singapore, we feasted on there rice ( with chicken and salty fish) the Keow teow and the famous claypot chicken. Beer was the same price as what you pay in a 7/11 but its ice cold and served under the stars and goes well with a couple serves of spring rolls. You know its a good place when the tables are full of pilots and airline crews getting there stopover meals as well as the locals dining out. We were fortunate enough to hear the story about how Fattys restaurant begun so many years ago and were honored to have eaten in a restaurant with such humble beginnings. If you get one meal in Singapore - get it at Fattys
5
We dined at Fatties on the recommendation of our Hotel Reservations Supervisor. It was very busy and we were seated in the open mall area. We dined on Chilli and Ginger Crab and it was absolutely delicious. The entree of Spring Rolls were among the best that we have tasted.We would definitely dine there again next time
5
I have visited "Fatty's" in its' various locations over the last 30 years, in my life as airline crew.It is always the first place that I visit in Singapore, I love the Spring Rolls and Indonesian Prawns.I am heading there this weekend,probably for the last time before I retire, I will miss it
5
Great. Yummy chilli crab and bok choy. All dishes were delicious!
4
i like Chinese foods that they are offered. the staff also very helpful.
4
XO Fish Head, Sweet and Sour Pork and sambal kangkung (vegetable). The roasted selections are quite nice as well. For drink try the home made chrysanthemum tea
4
The spring rolls are great, as is the mongolian fish. It is not the place for a romantic dinner, more a beers and casual outside dinner spot.
4
Its been a year since I last visited Fatty's, and its still the same...
Great value, huge portions, great staff, wide variety of food...
You cant beat the Fat Man !
5
7 adults, 4 teenagers, 2 little kids - two large tables joined together, food for everyone, lot's of ice cold beers and a great night for S$330.!!Keow Teow, Snow Pea Shoots, Ginger Beef, Ma Pao Tofu, Roast Chicken, Sui Yuk are but a few of the regular dishes that we all love.
4
I ate one night at Wing Seong Fatty's. An order of fried rice and black pepper prawns, combined with a couple of beers, was all I could eat (and far more than I should have!). Food was excellent, as was service.Most seating is outdoors on the sidewalk, directly opposite Sim Lim Square. Prices were very reasonable and credit cards are accepted
5
I dreamed I went back Fatty's the way it was in 1979 when there were just tables out under the stars. My wife and I visited last week, and I can confirm they provide reliably very good Chinese food at excellent prices, just as when their fame was beginning. We ordered seafood bee hoon and sweet and sour chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was unusually tasty to my palate, and my wife kept "borrowing" pieces of sauce-covered chicken from my plate. Apparently the cook fried the coating in very hot oil so that it was crisp, and all of the cuts of chicken were tender. Service was friendly, and the restaurant still ran like a family business: when a dish was cooked, the cook hit a bell and someone came to pick it up. The bill for food and soft drinks was SGD 20. The inside and outside tables are not fancy, but they are comfortable, and the menu is aimed at both local and expatriate taste. Fatty's still provides an outstanding value. I see that one current website has selected this, the original Fatty's, as the best Cantonese restaurant in Singapore. And so it was thirty years ago, too. You really can't go wrong here
5
There are many "Fatty's" restaurants all over the island but this is the one and only Fatty Wing Seong that has been around forever! The food is consistently super (over the last 35 years I've been eating there - they have moved locations over the years numerous times but are now located right next to Sim Lim Square where you can walk off your meal haggling over the latest electronic gadgets), the service is exemplary by its staff/owners, and the value for money is hard to beat. They will even create a dish to your own specifications outside their lean and mean menu. Impossible to beat. Highly recommended. Go now!!
4
Been a while since I'd last been but still recognised some of the staff. Nothing has changed, and the food is still great. Also, great location opposite Sim Lim for those who want a beer & dinner after a hard few hours haggling over the latest hi tech computer or whatever
5
Fattys is a favourite because it is consistent. The food is always good and the service is fast and courteous. The place is not fancy but new and clean.
4
The restaurant may be basic with plastic chairs, but the food is always good. Eaten quite a few times and always found it to be very reasonable and very tasty. Salt & Pepper prawns are among the best I've tasted.
5
great food , good service and a varied menu.Very reasonable prices
4
Piping hot, fresh food,mcold beer! Recommend noodles with duck and the chicken clay pot. Everything was really tasty and fresh. Large beers only $6. We ordered too much but ate everything it was that good. It's very casual with plastic plates certainly not 5 star surroundings but 5 star food!

As a westerner in Singapore, I was really craving a bit of home, but not looking for traditional western food. I saw the reviews and decided to try Fatty's. It was delicious. Very much what I see back home, but with Chili Crab and other Singaporean flavors as well. The "Sweet and Sour Chicken" and the "Beef and Green Peppers" were both delicious. The only thing that reminded me strictly of China was the inclusion of Sea Cucumbers on the menu - I didn't try them, but they are next on my list! The atmosphere is very comfortable (very casual) and the service is great. I will be making this a regular dining experience. The cost? Spring Roll, 2 mains, fried rice, chinese tea and 2 beers . . . $41SG
5
We loved it!After spending loads of money on pricey meals, finally we found a restaurant that offers quality delicious meals with reasonable price. We went to Fatty's for lunch and were greeted by the shop's owner (I assumed). He took us to a table and talked to us about what we'd like to have. We ended up with one plate of spicy prawns, one small roasted duck, one chilli vegetable, and one hor fun (fried noodle). The duck was alright. The vegetable was very good. The noodle was even better. But the prawns were the best! Really delicious. Total came down to $48, which we thought it'd be like $60+!!!Will definitely return :

Fattys is located behind Sim Lim Square I come here many years. Awesome simple Chinese food, both food and drinks are very cheap. The staff look ancient but the service is good. Do yourself a favour and visit Fattys at least once I can guarantee you will want to go back. The nice is you can sit outside.I always combine this with a visit when I go to Sim Lim Square for my Computer supplies
5
Fatty's is a Singapore institution.I was told about it some years ago by Airline crew who frequent this place on their Singapore overnights.It is a busy place but don't expect silver service.'This is a place for enjoying fantastic food and Chinese Beer whilst sitting on basic chairs and tables.It is always busy and very reasonably priced.And only a short walk from Bugis station and its markets
3
Very fast, ok service. The waiter prevented us for ordering too much food which was very much appreciated once we saw the size of the portions. Food vary tasty.Vegetarian choices were very few though. The environment is not that nice, the restaurant is in the middle of shopping center area
4
I am a regular to Singapore and I always pop in for dinner and sometimes lunch!Start with the spring rollsTHen BBQ pork, chicken hot pot and black pepper prawns and baby gai lam (sic)Service is good and the beer is coldI wish I was there now
4
Enjoyed a delicious meat at Fatty's - recommend the chicken hot pot and black bean prawns.

We were recommended to this restaurant by some local food reviews from Singapore. We saw quite a number of foreign visitors and expatriates and some local there.According to my family, this restaurant is very popular among visitors and the expatriates.Our food took quite some time to arrive i.e. comparatively slower service than other restaurant in view of the fact that there weren't many customers at that time.Food was definitely overrated. Normally, the price point is average and can be considered a little higher than other restaurants that serve higher quality food such as the Jade Crystal Restaurant
5
A group of us went to Fatty's in Singapore and had the best meal that we have had in Singapore for the most reasonable price. We have been going to Fatty's since 1974 in it's various locations and now that it is in Burlington Square it is as good as always. Fatty has passed on but Kok Wing, his son made sure that we were well looked after. We had crispy skin roast duck---a medium but the platter was enormous, roast bar-b-que pork---again a huge medium platter, Indonesian curry chicken [wonderful coconut-lemongrass flavour], vegatables and steamed rice. Along with several large bottles of Tiger beer, we expected the bill to be $150 but it was only $66---and there was still a mountain of delicious food that we hadn't been able to finish. We have been to numerous Chinese restaurants in Singapore as we used to live here, but Fatty's is still by far the best!!!! Good for anyone, groups, couples, or families
5
We stumbled across Fattys after a visit to Sim Lim Square many years ago and we never miss going to Fattys... It's a must do in Singapore! Awesome Chinese food, both food and drinks are very cheap....bit of a favourite with ex-pats (probably due to the cheap beer) the staff look ancient but the service is fantastic...they don't say much but that just adds to their appeal .....a bit quirky...the hand signals are fun ;-) do yourself a favour and visit Fattys at least once I can guarantee you will want to go back
5
We went to Fattys on our last night in Singapore and it was one of the best experiences we had. Almost on the corner of Albert Street and Bencoolen Street and just around the corner from the Ibis this is a great place to eat. Every other place was empty except Fattys.We ordered and unfortunately they got it wrong and I didnt realise. Apology followed but I was glad they had made the mistake for the peppered steak and the blackbean steak were delicious. Topping it off with Anchor beer on a hot, humid Singapore night turned out to be a night we will remember for a long long time. If you go to Singapore this is a must try place.This is also a great place to people watch and just enjoy life
4
Been there a couple of times in June, had a very tasty and good Chinese food (in my opinion).The place is not for a romantic dinner, but if you like traditional and authentic Chinese food, it will worth a visit. Many tourists and resident ex-pats use to have dinner there.I had a fried rice and black pepper beef (the other day a sweet and sour pork), good portions and excellent taste.I will recommend to all Chinese food lovers for a casual dinner with friends or relatives
4
Its like you are one of the lcoals when you enter Fatty's....and trust me there wont be any room in your stomach for more food for about 2 days...The food kept coming, the spring rolls are so big they are cut up for three people to eat..All in all, a great Singapore eatery, with very reasonable prices, and far exceeds more pricey and established names in Singapore.Take the time for a slow lunch, you wont be unhappy..
4
Cheap and cheerful, great food. Service was quick, a little abrupt, as you would expect. Having come from India we were excited to eat beef! Black pepper beef was particularly good (tasty and tender). Great for a good, quick meal, good price (big portions, but you can choose from a range of sizes). Or go with a group and stay for longer. Highly recommend for a casual meal.It was a bit hard to find and from memory it was near the BK (around the corner from?) and on the opposite side from the Ibis. By the crossing
5
I am in Singapore for two weeks, and have already eaten twice in the first week at Fatty's. I put myself in the hands of the savvy waitress (owner?) who recommended just the right pork dish sliced barbecued Pork, Claypot Shrimp and Green Veggies in Oyster sause which was awesome. If I hadn't drank three beers I would have gotten off cheap.Second time I walked in alone, and there were no small tables, so the Owner (Elder gent working the floor) sat me at the neighboring cafe's table and instructed me to order my drinks from them, he then served me on the side. This kind of clever personal service is sorely missed in this age of corporate eateries. Had the Combination BBQ Pork, and Duck with cucumbers, very yummy and the Singapore Fried Noodles. ABSOLUTLEY AWESOME NOODLES
5
After a two year gap we were back at fatty's and nothing had changed - the food is still great, the owners work the floor, the service is slick and without fuss. Take your own wine or nip next door to the coffee shop and buy there's. Ice cold Tsing Tao. Try the roast chicken, the deer meat, the di mou, the ma por tofu, the kway teo, spring rolls and more ice cold beer
