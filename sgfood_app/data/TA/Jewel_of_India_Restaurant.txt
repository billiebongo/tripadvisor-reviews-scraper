Located in the basement of Park Royale. We were starving for a good Indian meal. The service rendered by Kawan was excellent! Love the mango lassi! Ambience is ok.

This restaurant serves Indian cuisine both veg and non veg and also serves Indian tour groups. It is a 2 min walk from Mustafa center.

Just behind Park Royal hotel and offer authentic Indian food. Service is very good and fast with lovely food.

Courteous Staff and good quality of Indian food as if you are in India. Clean and good ambience with prompt service

we had Buffet Lunch & dinner hear ...Indian food is good .....but standard quality .....lots of PPL there many time too much full have to wait for Roti 15 mints.....over all Standard experience...........
3
We were taken here by our tour manager. The food is average although the decor is a bit better than other Indian restaurants in similar price range. The space outside, corridoor leading to the restaurant, is not maintained clean.Food taste was average and so the choice very limited for the buffet.However this is a place where most good Indian tour operators bring in their guests
4
Very friendly Manager and other staff. Very much suitable to South & North Indians.Vegetarian & Non-vegetarian items are available for lunch & dinner. Had lunch( Buffet & Ala Carte) for 2 days.All dishes are displayed with placards to enable visitors to identify and select as per your choices.When required one can opt for take away also.Well decorated with good ambience and reasonably clean & hygiene
5
Jewel of India serves an excellent Indian cuisines with option of normal or Jain food. On the first day of our stay in Singapore, we just dropped and enjoyed delicious food with human touch services. We choose to have our lunch and dinner all the 4 days stay in Singapore
4
A pocket friendly option for those yearning for indian taste. The dishes were authentic indian in taste and tasty.
1
they normally serve indian buffet.. not verxm spacious sitting .. a very normal restaurent.. rather looks like as mess or canteen..
5
Its a best place for Indians who are on Holidays in Singapore,Food quality is good taste is as good as in India,Special Thanks to Mr.Javed For exellent service
3
We stayed in Parkroyal hotel and on last day, we had tried indian food here but to our despair, the food quality was not good.
4
did not expect such good indian punjabi cuisine in Singapore. Feel at home by having food here in a foreign country..
4
Food was just Fab. Very difficult to get a vegetarian food in Singapore. But this hotel serves amazing Vegetarian food. Amazing.

Please don't even think to try to have food in such a disgusting restaurant. The buffet dinner was presented good but the food quality was most worst. The food was cold and when we approach to staff for the same they behave very rudely. They say this is what we have its your choice to eat. Never try this restaurant even if they offer at free of cost. :
1
I was in Singapore with a group of 31 pax and we had around 3-4 meal's in this restaurant. On the first visit we were about 30-40 minutes late than the schedule time and the staff was so rude to the guest for that reason. I do understand that we were late but instead of serving the meals and insulting the guest they could have just refused to serve. The same pathetic service continued for the next two meal's but I found this common in all the Indian restaurant during our trip. Maybe they should take up a lesson or two in basic courtesy and hospitality
1
Thou it is easy asseccible place from mustufa market food and serving was not good.. We get jain option bt that to limited... Waiters wer very rude... On asking about somethng they ignore us... While attending big grp,, they dont attend small grp... Vl never visit again... Instead thr are many more good restaurant who serve nice jain food... No chance to visit again in this restuarant.
4
We stayed at Hotel Park Royal on our visit to Singapore......this restaurant is in the Basement of the Hotel......this place is accessible from the Hotel Lobby...........Quality and Taste of food was good.......they have both veg and non veg optionsWhen we reached Hotel we were informed that it will take some time for our room to get ready and as it was almost lunch time we had lunch here.......then again we had dinner here next day after we came back from Universal Studios.......Good place to have Indian foo
3
Indian Restaurant in Singapore, we had our dinner for three days in this restaurant, no menu change. Staff was very arrogant in answering our query. Food quality average.
4
This is a genuinely Indian restaurant in little India. Buffet dinner is economical and very good but for excellent experience go for on order basis.
5
it was a nice dinner with my family, great food, I feel like in india, but it was quite crowded when we were there.
4
This Restaurant located in Little India and opposite Mustafa shopping mall also in front of Ferrari park MRT.
Good Quality and quantity also very nice and yummy.Staff also Good and co operative .
A nice place for Indian lunch & dinner.
4
With a lot of variety and options for all.
Good taste makes you feel at home
Very friendly staff and at a good location in little india though a bit inside the complex.
A nice place for family, friends or corporates
4
There are many items of foods for customer. And also it is full of varieties custome.Maximum peoples like spicy and Dosha, it is very much Feverate for Indian.
4
We have enjoyed lunch & dinner. Found everything like Indian food & recipes. Staff are very helpful. Sit where you like. Food was less spicy
5
You will not feel you are out of India while you are in this restaurant. The staff is great & you feel like coming time & again. Great Indian food in a foreign nation.
3
Dined on 3rd Nov'16Time : 8.30pmHad buffet dinner. the spread had fair choice and the rice and tandoori rotis were served hot which was a big plus.food tasted good and the seviyan kheer was a good way to finish the dinner.overall a satisfactory experience.the place gets crowded by 8.30pm so recommend to have early dinner as the buffet starts at 6.30pm
4
Staff are very helpful. Sit where you like. Food can be made less spicy, in our case cooked to order with plus or minus different ingredients. (I wanted chicken and white sauce and nuts so they made me a korma. More sauce than chicken, but cashew nuts were good.) One couple wanted to share and order only one main dish. No problem. (I've been in restaurants which insist that every person orders a main dish.) Portions were large. We had plenty. Food leftovers were wrapped up to go. A screen at one end showed dishes available.Food slightly spicy, didn't zing, but everybody was happy.High backed booths enable you to sit in seclusion and talk without being heard by staff or other patrons and not being distracted, very good whether the restaurant is full or as when we were there empty, but we did not feel lonely in the large restaurant because of the cosy corner.The buffet looked good value. Wash basins are in the restaurant. However, public toilets are outside the restaurant (end of ground floor corridor) which might be stressful and a nuisance if you want to keep with a group or have children or elderly members. I suggest you go before entering the restaurant. Very near the Farrer Park MRT - good for groups or tourists or if you are short of time or money you can get there quickly and cheaply. Right near the Mustafa department store (24 hour shopping) and all the little shops of Little India
5
Had a great time there. Adorable hospitality. Well educated staff. Delicious Indian food. If you are to have Indian taste, you must visit Jewel of India.
4
they serve good Indian food. Non veg and Veg both were quite delicious. Place is bit crowded as lot of tour groups visit.
Overall good place and low rates.
5
Food is amazing in taste. They offer variety of food. If you are vegan then you don't need to worry. Vegetarian food is also awesome. Worth trying.

On 24-06-2016 visited the restaurant's as our tour operator booked there for dinner. We reached at 09-45 pm . We were told that our tour operator Tourland Travel PTE LTD 11277 has not booked any dinner there than I requested the staff to call my tour operator which was done by the manager with courteous which prove the nice nature of manager. Thereafter our dinner was confirmed. We take the dinner in buffet. Food was just average. Prices are normal . No special environment. Overall good
3
On our tour at Singapore, we had dined a couple of times at Jewel of India restaurant. This place, whether at lunch or dinner time is seen busy. I think, all those tour operators managing visitors from India travelling in a conducted tour set up prefer this joint. Mainly because, the price of food is not high. Taste of Indian food items, I think is average. One thing positive I noticed was their effort to maintain cleanilness; inspite of heavy rush.. The variety of food items spread at the buffet table was also impressive, so also the standard of service offered by the staff. But the heavy rush and related sound problems created by India natives together with the lack of discipline / manners force me to rate it as an average restauran
3
Its Buffet Spread which is limited and basically for Tour Operators.Not recommend this place. If you go there he will charge you about SGD $18 per person or maybe less depends how you negotiate with him but i feel it's expensive considering the quality of the food and options he give you on the spread.Rather try other Indian restaurants near by.Its Hot and Running as all Tour Operators like Thomas Cook / Kesari / Sotc Others useLocation is an advantage as its in the basement of Park Royal Kitchener Road.It's not at all romantic. Infact a total chaos. In the same Money you have better options i feel
3
Average food. We had our Lunch buffet scheduled by tour operator in this restro. the food was pretty avaerage and fewer options
4
Kids love the food , service is bit rude,buffet spread is not much,they can add more items may be icecream for dessert
1
Unfortunately don't want to comment more because we lost full impression.We were group of 50 and after hearing about this award winning restaurant and fixed the lunch here by our agent.Literally saying our entire 4days trip ruined because of one lunch .All my group members are frequent travellers and most of them travelled minimum 8_10.countries They were not at all impressed by food , attittude of staffs were so rude and it was such a bad time unfortunately
3
Buffet food was good but very crowded and service very slow and staff were very rigid. Had to wait too long for the rotis to be served
5
Hi,its a good resturent in little india back side of park royal nd mustafa...
Easy to reach.good food,We got buffet dinner with our package..but nice food,easy location,all variety in food in budget u can get here...
4
It is a nice restaurant if you want to have Indian food. you will also have buffet option as well...
5
A very tasty and good quality of Indian food that to be in a very decent location. Their staffs were very co-operative
5
The food is indeed very good. Better to order a-la-carte. Its better tan going for the buffet. Cheers guys.....
5
delicious buffet lunch and dinner..very good indian dishes..service is slow but food is tasty.good for indian food lover
4
we 16 group of people visited this restaurant & find food quality is good. serving good variety. our some group member ask for ATTA Fulka that was also served.
4
The food is tasty and staff is very friendly. The order arrived quickly and the food was good. The only problem we had was that the restaurant had some tour tie-up where in the tourist who have come through a specified tour operator would come there to have their lunch/dinner. Because of which it was noisy and crowded and hence we have to change our table also
3
I love Indian food and eat it at every opportunity. Jewel of India offered reasonable food that was well presented. Malai kofta could have had more flavour but the butter chicken was good. Table service was slow and the waiter seemed to get his inspiration from Lurch from the Addams family. Food came quickly.
5
An unassuming restaurant situated in the Arcade at L1 of the Parkroyal at Kitchener Road building, the is a great place to get really Indian food in Singapore. The preparations are good and are as per the actual Indian standards. The staff are very courteous and quite helpful on the phone when you place the order. The prices are also quite reasonable and not out of whack! The portions are filling for two and you wouldn't feel cheated. They also happily customise the food as per your request say if you want non-spicy, especially for a kid, etc. We found it on our third day of stay in Singapore and did not have our meals at any other restaurant again for the rest of the stay.Overall, it makes for a very good meal at the end of tiring day and when you want to have some good Indian food
4
Had visited after our visit to the Night Safari . Very Nice Service , they take care of our needs very well. Liked the Chicken curry. Did like the fish fry much . The served a nice chocolate icecream to my kid to too. Overall a good restaurant with ease of access from parkroyal
5
THe food is great and the service is satisfactory. Family run place, one can spot all of family members in front line. If personalized service is not expected then to have a buffet, one will enjoy the receipies.
5
good food, smiling staff and above all quick refilling of dishes for a group.
cleanliness was also remarkable
5
good food..they serve buffet dinner..good indian dishes including desserts.but too much rush there so we have to wait for rotis..else nice restaurant near mustafa centre
4
they have a complete set of menu for Indian food but you need to wait a but to get your stuff served to your table - though it took some time for me to get my food but I enjoyed it late
4
Food quality is very good.We have taken the buffet so there is little restriction on choice of food
2
The location is good just behind Mustafa market in Little India but the food and services is a big let down. The place is always crowded with group's from various travel companies which results in total chaos. I have visited this place 3-4 times in last couple of years but every time it is the same story. I would suggest you try various local food eateries near the Mustafa Center
4
Nice place to have Indian food. Though there is not much variety with respect to taste in different dishes I've ordered for take away, still I appreciate the quality & quantity of the stuff served. They may like to review the prices of items like Dal, Veg Biryani which are bit on the higher end
3
Nothing great, rather the taste was no where near the Indian food. Had been there with my friends. Average ambience.
4
If you miss the Desi Chinese food in Singapore, look no further. This place serves great food- both Indian and Chinese. But Chinese is what they are best at, especially if want the Indian variety!Pricing too is not a rip-off, and the seating space is ample. Location is good too, very close to Mustafa in little India. Must visit
3
Had 1 dinner with family. It offers buffet meals catering both veg and non veg dishes.We had eaten Butter fish curry,chicken curry and biryani.All were good. The nans were good do were sweets.Restaurant is situated near shopping hub of Indian tourist Mudtafa! Its medium sized clean eatery.only negative thing I can say is Plastic glasses are used to serve wate
3
Under the Hotel Park Royal Kitchener, Kitchener Road, very closed to Mustafa Shopping Mall, just opposite door of the Mall, we had our dinner on 22nd Feb 2015, overall its ok with verity of food, not so spicy, we enjoyed , closing time 10:30 PM
4
We enjoyed Three Days Buffet Dinner at this restaurant and It is better. My Parents liked it hence i can rate it tastes back to home.
5
This restaurant located at shopping arcade !
I could definitely say that compare to all little India side restaurant !
This is best one !
Great !!
4
I was there for 4 days in singapore and i visited jewel of india on my 3rd day for my dinner and was feeling like 'WOW". Food was superb and well maintained resturant. seriously i wasted my money on day 1, i had chinese, south indian, and indian panner tikka masala was awsome, and non veg. over all I enjoyed..........:
3
Centrally located below the Hotel Park Royal on Kitchener Road. Food is good but there is scope for improvement. The buffet variety is very limited - taste wise very good . Usually there are lots of groups so it gets crowded. Dinners a strictly no no , during lunch time not so crowded. Ambience not very great. Overall an OK experience with no major complaints
1
We went for buffet lunch, no starter no verity rice no fruits no ice cream for this they charged $18 for adult nd my doughter is 3yr old for her they charged 14$. Very bad nd rude service no good ambience.. total waste of mone
5
Serves the tastiest Indian food in singapore. Dont go with package coupon. Go for al a carte for yourself. I tried dal makhani, aaloo jeera, tandoori paneer tikka,jeera pulao, masala papad and butter naan. It was just awesome. Please do not go to any other Indian vegetarian restaurant. Just go to Jewel of India
5
i have visited singapore from 31st oct 14 to 4 th nov 14 with wife. our tour organiser has given us 4 coupon of four different restaurant, one of them is of jewel of india and it was the best one.food-veg-non veg both very nice.cleanliness- very good.ambience- very goodquantity-very good.staff- very nice hospitality.location-very easy and close to mustafa.overall 5 out of 5 points for this restaurant
4
This place is a good choice for those who just want to dine after a long day of outing in Singapore. Don't expect any great ambiance. It's just like a simple typical restaurant in India. Just a regular spread of Indian buffet, taste good though. It's not a place to hangout for a long relaxed evening. Just for a quick buffet dinner
2
Lot of people from India get the food coupon of this restaurant when they book their meal in their package. For those people they provide separate buffet lunch/dinner. Be it a la carte or be it buffet, it lacks in variety and taste. Do not book your meal in your package-this will save your money and will give you a choice too.
5
I am from Jamnagar India. I stay in Singapore for 5 days. I came to jewel of India restaurant 4 times. Food is very very nice. Staff is very cooperative.I recommend all Indian vegetarian people this restaurant.
1
Looks good but can't get the expected taste.
Not at all gud experience either single group or family
5
I have almost tried all the restaurants in Singapore, but I still like to visit this restaurant very often, the staff is very friendly, they have a huge seating capacity and the food quality is indeed outstanding.
I highly recommend this restaurant
4
When four of us enterd the restaurant,we found a big crowd making lot of noice.We thought of going back to another restaurant.We enquired about it.The crowd left in few mts.Three of us opted for Buffet lunch and one for Ala Carte.We liked all the food-a very delicious.Indian Bread was served very fresh abd hot.Both veg and non veg were tasty and we enjoyed the restaurant,Staff are caring.We recommend this restaurant
3
Was having very high opinion on this restaurant cos of the name tag of " park royal"...we went for dinner buffet. Soup, veg curries, roti, biryani rice was served. The taste was very normal. Later we realized that its more of " group tourist" restaurant. Groups n groups of ppl were coming in and gng out of restaurant...Just an one time for this restaurant..
1
This is a shabby restaurant with pretty bad food. They mainly serve to large large groups from India who come to Singapore for a few days and are forced to eat here because of the group arrangements. The food is limited and awful in taste.As an example, they will serve you TOFU instead of panner and I tried the most watery rasam in entire Singapore here. The food is worth less than 5 bucks here.Dont waste your time and money here
2
 things to understand :If v Two isiting first time in singapore and love too good vegetarian food..THEN STRICTLY DONT VISIT THISbecause u cannot expect very delicious food when you choose buffet and are with group. Very very below average... Palak paneer terrible.. Dal makhni ok types. That's it what we look.. When eating out.go KHAMSANA HOTEL NEXT ROAD.IF U WANT BUDGET HOTEL not in very hungry moodChose this..it's cheaper 1 person $15. Very cheap with what you pay 50$ for same food menu but very tasty type...IF HUNGRY DONT GO..WANT CHEAP MUST GO
1
big no nodont ever step into this hotelhorrible tasteless foodrude staffon asking for a spoon the waiter replies ...got to the buffet table and takebland taste less foodon telling the waiter ..says cant do anythingguys do not ever venture into this hotela big no....
4
I will not recommend to any Indian to visit this restaurant, because neither the food is good nor service and behavior of staff is good. The over all environment of restaurant is so bad ( Can't explain in words).
3
The restaurant is just behind Park Royal . The food is ok but the staff is not co-operating . For groups the capacity is less and it becomes crowded . Keeping Indian Group in mind the Restaurant should not be so strict in their policy.
5
Good place to hold family function & gathering.very good setting.It was nice setting done by jaw aid & others. I will come again
4
This restaurant happened to be very near to my hotel. I casually visited to taste food. Found it neat, good and clean. The price was also reasonable for the taste. Worth trying
5
The food was really good with so many varieties with veg and non-veg. so many different variety food like south Indian and north Indian were also available. Since we were from south Indian the rasam was excellent.
3
Nothing great, nothing bad. The ambiance resembles a wedding reception - too many pink frills and curtains!
4
Preparation of entire Indian food and service makes you feel at home.Cost of all dishes was reasonable. Overall experience bounds you to re-visit Jewel of India.
1
I didn't like the place at all...avoid this place if u r with ur family...drunkards and irritating people dine here....the food was also stale...
2
I bought the promotional vouchers for the buffet dinner thinking that as it is associated with the Park Royal Hotel, it probably would have decently high standard.I was totally wrong......It is located on the ground level of the hotel shopping area.The ambience is very basic and the buffet which is the subject of this review even more so.The salad bar is some onion and cucumber slices, uncut green chillies and achar in an unpretentious container placed near the salad bar area.There is one variety of soup and no bread roll to go with it.Dinner buffet is supposed to commence at 6.30pm and by 7.30pm some of the dishes were cold or mildly warm at best. Indian food tastes good when it is served hot. The so called Dal-makhni was so watered down and overcooked that it could appropriately be called SOUP.The non-vegetarian dishes were butter chicken, which was acceptable, and fish which was heavily battered and deep fried.There have been many promotion for buffets in the indian restaurants around the area at 70% of their price with much better presentation and content.The vegetarian dishes of makhni dall (soup), masala ladyfinger and paneer masala were of acceptable standard at best.There was only one dessert -custard with fruit.Yes they did serve very good naans and tandoori roti.The overall presentation was lacking imagination
3
We were there for a dinner buffet-limited selection of food for buffet style but food was yummy. however the dining experience was ruined when I tried to help myself to the lime slices at the buffet table to squeeze some into my h20 to aid digestion, the waiter told me rudely from a distance tht I was not allowed to do so! He said the lime was only for salad (yeah..cucumber slices were the only raw vegetables served) .I reasoned questioning what difference it made how id like to take my lime..i would have ingested the lime all the same! i had a good time till this guy ruined it all with his stupid reasons, i would never go back there again
3
Went for a buffet lunch on a weekday and the food was ok.. No starter was there, the food was ok and they have named Halwa for kesari bath.. think they had naan and rice, dhall, one panner kadai masala, two veggie, one fish and one chicken. The raita was ok.Just ok for the price
4
We had our lunch and dinner here for 4 times. We are group of 46. We selected this place because of its location. It is very near to the Mustafa center. Quality of the food is good. Refilling of the food is fast. On can choose this place with out any doubt
3
It is located at the Park Royale Hotel on Kitchener road.
it is near the mustafa center.
we went there for lunch - buffet.
nothing great about the food but was good.
5
we enjoyed the style of food , real nice indian , service good . reccommended , no need to book , a good selection on the menu , seemed to be genuine indian cuisine , good location too
1
For a north Indian restraunt, this place terribly sucks big time. Service is awful and the food, it's not that great. Please look away when you happen to see this place even by chance. Period!
3
Located at the Ground level of the Park Royal Hotel. Accessible from Serangoon Plaza as well as by lift from the Park Royal Hotel. The Buffet is priced inclusive of Taxes & Service charge @ 14.68 SGD. Except for the fact that the Chef tends to use a bit more oil than required, the food is surely not bad. The food is very much Indian, but the problem occurs because the Restaurant is home for lunch to group tours. South Indian stuff, like Rasam etc., is not their forte. Stick to North Indian food & except for the oily effect, the food is quite good. The Tandoor items are their strength. I suggest a la carte & not the buffet
2
As something of an afficiado of Indian food I was disappointed by the quallity of the dishes I ordered as well as indifferent service. Samosas we deep fried and oily filled with an indifferent paste of indeterminate origin - possible bought in deep frozen. The lamb biryiani dish I ordered was again vey oily and not particularly flavoursome. Poor
3
The food quality definitely is not comparable with even average restaurants in India. It is more of a compulsion to eat there as it was in the package. Given a choise I will not prefer to eat there. The furniture & other peripherials were very average & on one evening the rotis were exhausted due to excessive crowd. We settled with rice only along with sabzi..
3
This restaurant is bang opposite to Mustafa. So after a good shopping in Mustafa, it is a nice place to cool off here. This joint offers buffet dinning and is also popular with group tour bookings, hence can get very crowded. The food is average, but the Mango Kesari served to us was watery and tasteless and horrible. It appears that the dish was getting over and water was clearly added to it
4
We had a decent lunch here today: good garlic-suffused naan, fish curry and a vegetable biryani, all for very little money. There's usually a buffet with about 15 dishes, although that was not available today. Perhaps that was because we were the only customers there, but despite our solitude, it wasn't at all bad.The only thing we found a little disappointing were the vegetable samosas - a little less hot than we were expecting.
4
Very close to Mustafa. Great Indian food. Neat and clean. Authentic North Indian dishes, wide variety. Not very spicy and non oily. Typical Indian sweet served. Separate section for Non vegetarian food. Under SIN $ 15 for lunch. Must try if you are travelling from Mumbai or north India
4
During my recent trip to Singapore my travel agent had suggested to have dinner at this restaurant.I obliged and my experience was very good.The Buffet dinner is really with good starters.The main-course of the dinner was really very good suiting the Indian traveller's palate.Especially,the non-veg dishes like chicken masala and mutton curry.The icing on the cake was the Indian sweet dishes like the ' Kheer', a typical sweet conction of India.I had my dinner at Jewel of India on two nights and I gave full marks to them not only for food, but for ambience and service
