Just visiting through, wanted a decent place to eat. Suddenly found myself befriended by a beautiful parrot who led me to this amazing place. Great food and drinks are awesome. So special.

That was salvation place for me. It was so pleasant to find such a peaceful place in such a fuge city. Delicious food, amazing live music, cosy interior and friendly service!

It was quiet when we visited but really nice vibe about this small place.
My spicy lamb pita was really tasty. Well spiced and exactly the thing for lunch with a really cold beer!
5
What shall I say? Great ambience, super friendly and smiling staff, food was good and they make excellent Vietnamese coffee! Live music in the evening so what else could one ask for.
Totally going back if fate takes me back to Singapore.

The cosy oasis by the Haji Lane offer food and drinks with laid back atmosphere. Free Wlan. Going Om is good place take a short or long brake on hot and humid day.

Stumbled on this cute cafe walking around Kampong Glam in Singapore and so glad we did. Super service with a smile. Great food - lots of healthy options and big portions freshly made. Free glasses of water topped up without asking (don't you just hate paying for tap water?) and such a relaxed and happy atmosphere.A real must tr

Going Om is great. The atmosphere is exactly what I love - pretty hippy. Such a nice vibe. Be prepared to wait a while and for them not to have exactly what you wanted but it‚Äôs 100% worth it. Food was incredible!!! They also had vegan Red Velvet Cake. It‚Äôs such a good experience. Loved it. Oh and they have free wifi.

We stopped by for a beer as we were ready for a quiet break on a crowded street. This place was inviting with its calm dark atmosphere and Hindustani rags. There were two small well-behaved dogs attending to the guests; we didn't mind them and rather enjoyed watching them fit in with the decor and style. Not sure we would eat there as the kitchen was right next to a somewhat DIY toilet.

Going Om is one of my all time favourite places to be and hang out at in Singapore :)The food menu is getting better - though I rarely eat there so I can't really comment on that! I go there for the music, community and ambience :) The live musicians are ace and the way they support and platform local musicians is so great! All in a street setting with a beautiful vibe! It sometimes feel like the side streets of boho Europe...but I'm glad it's in Singapore :)I've spent many a night just sitting with an iced tea until the late hours and listening to the chill music, as well as many nights dancing my feet away to the energising music too! There is no lack in talent and no lack in atmosphere :)I've also requested vegan chai...which they are working towards! That would make this place the best place for me :

nice bars and good friendly staff but need more fans for this hot weather. as much as I like the ambient and live music which is awesome. why do you stop soft drinks after 8pm?
5
Cool little bar with fantastic food with unique twist on Panni Pury and
Lamb with flat bread. Tasted fantastic! Made all the better by live music. Not a restaurant but very, relaxed, cool and worth a visit üëç
5
The atmosphere is what originally attracted me to this restaurant/bar. Lots of world trade-type decor with many plants etc. Front completely open to the street with seating spilling onto the sidewalk.
Staff very friendly and attentive.
Selection of wines, beers and cocktails.
Interesting fusion menu.

Coolest bar i have visited in Singapore. Went on a Sunday evening, waiters so friendly, music, gr8 food and reasonably priced. Situated Haji Lane area, next time I am in singapore I will most definately revisit.
5
Nice to relax at after a full day of sightseeing or shopping. $55 for a bucket of 5 beers, they let you pick the beer off the menu which is a great plus. Good vibes, really friendly staff. Definitely recommend!
5
Had a great evening with the busker playing great vibes. Highly recommended for a chilled night. As they say " The gift of life is in the present "
4
Great hideaway on a narrow quaint street with unique shops. Calm and serene "hippie" establishment with nice selection of drinks and wines. However no draft beer. Lovely to just rest your feet.
5
Lovely relaxing atmosphere in this bar / cafe / restaurant. Had a couple of drinks and a meal - excellent ( curried prawn pasta üëç). Stayed for a couple of hours stroking the owners Italian greyhounds who were so chilled out üëç

I liked their fusion theme of indo-western, though they have a very limited menu for food and drinks. The home-made nutrition snack bar was good, but a little pricey

Ideally located on the super cute Haji Lane, Going Om is a great option for luch or a refreshing healthy juice, smoothie or lassie. The place is quite small & the service is far from being a Mach 3 one, but you're not there just to have a meal. You'll also enjoy the atmosphere.Food is good and prices are friendly. So it's a big YES 
5
Going Om has a great little spot on a quieter section of Haji Lane where they offer great, well-priced drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) while patrons listen to very talented performers. We came around 10pm and had no problem getting a table in sight of the musician, but by 11pm (when we left), the restaurant's crowd spread far and wide down the street. We didn't know it at the time, but apparently more acts come on later in the night, so it would probably be best to grab a good table at 10:30ish and catch the first two acts.Drinks were well-made and well-priced, and the service was helpful and happy. Definitely a great place to enjoy cooler Singaporean nights
5
It's a hipster, youngster hippie spirit place. I came just for drink, very late at night, enjoyed the live music very much.
If you're looking for a drinking night chill out, here is not a bad choice!
5
it was a cool night and we were allured by the live music. so we stayed for a couple of beers and had such a great time.
5
Located along Haji Lane, a popular hipster hangout, this is one of my favourite spots to chill-out with friends. I especially enjoy the late night live music. Do come early, otherwise you'll have to wait to get a seat.
4
I do not associate this little gem with its great food or beverages yet I find myself returning to this marvelous cafe more so for its lights, the hip crowd & for the fantastic live music that almost always gives the place a very chique bohemian street cafe vibe. Stop by here for a beer or for some great live music when you're in Haji Lane!

Atmosphere is good and live music is nice. But as I waited in line for bathroom, had misfortune of seeing how they prepare the food ... I suggest you steer clear of the food. Drink and enjoy band ... don't come hungry

Best to arrive around 9.30pm to enjoy the live performance by busker Jukuleles. Awesome ambience.Food wise, ordered Avocado salad (add on popcorn chicken), chicken wings and Fish & Chips. Portion was generous but waited really looooong for food to arrive. The avocado was unripe and was hard. The rest was fine. Limited seats available indoors. Mostly outdoors and some of the seats are tiny. Get ready for smokers and rainy weather. A great place to chill overall.

We were searching for cafes with live music and stumbled upon Going Om; and it definitely didnt disappoint.The ambiance was amazing and the crowd was awesome. The singers were pretty good too, and setup a great atmosphere altogether.Its open until 3 AM; and its a great way to spend Saturday night
4
It will make you feel very chillax. Good music, good location and very affordable drinks. A good place to ease your stress.You will feel connected with eveybody. One place in Singapore where you can dance in the street and don't feel like you owe it to anyone. One of my favorite hang out place on a weekend
4
I've been here several times but this is my first time here on a Saturday. Drinks here aren't great but you're really here for the atmosphere - sitting on little stools on the street, listening to great live music by buskers√¢‚Ç¨¬¶it'll show you a different side of Singapore which you'll love.

the menu is highly overpriced. we paid a whooping 20 dollar for a cocktail,. the cocktail itself was not so great for the price and the place. i may not visit this place and recommend this place to another perso
