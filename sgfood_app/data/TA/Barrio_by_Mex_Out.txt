The quality of food is excellent and overall service is too good! The location is too close to somerset mrt. One can enjoy mixican food here!

Loved the place as it has several vegetarian options. Authentic Mexican cuisine which is decently priced and open air seating is fun.

Most GF friendly places I had pre-planned to go to have been closed over Chinese New Year. Found this place after many hours of searching. Delicious, fresh and fun. Nice red wine to boot. They even got me in at the last minute when they were meant to be closing after a busy day. Thanks guys, Happy New Year.

This is a small Mexican infused restaurant at 313@Somerset. During peak hours it‚Äôs rather packed and space between tables can be of real concern, especially if your a little larger than the average Asian person. However, the food is pretty good. The half roast chicken was exceptional. It was cooked to perfection, tender and succulent. Couldn‚Äôt really ask for more. Ideal for a quick hunger buster!

Celebrated my Birthday here. Tacos and Half Chicken are delicious. Love the guacamole. The crew are friendly and approachable. üòä

Fish tacos was amazing. Service by the staff was also amazing. When I realised I ordered the wrong salad without the black beans and guacamole, she gave some to me on the side for free!

Mexout is my favorite Mexican (tex-mex) resto in SG as it serves good quality and good portions not to mentioned good service.Barrio By Mexout at 313 is my fave go to place especially after work dinner and drinks even brought my friends, family and colleagues and catered for house party. I used to go here once or twice a week. Service never fails me. They‚Äôve given me the best service so far. However, since they had the menu changed, good portion, good quality are gone. I‚Äôve not been back since I tried their new menu at Barrio Vivo City which was a disaster experience; bad service and tasteless (bland) food except probably the fish tacos.Their new taco selections are different now and I think it‚Äôs not worth it, unless you‚Äôre willing to pay $6 per taco then order the good one - fish tacos. Prawn taco is okay but 2 small pieces of prawn in a taco for $6? Please take note that Mexout is now using 4 inch corn tortillas at Barrio 313 and Barrio vivo city branch) so don‚Äôt go here hungry. Or just order their ‚Äúsharing‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry ‚Äúselection, its actually good for one person, except the half roasted chicken. Haha. Joke aside, they have other new dishes you can try. I recommend the pork tortitas, my favorite hangover food and ceviche (atleast this one they got it right) but when in doubt, go for the nachos or burritos.I will still go back that‚Äôs for sure as a matter of fact I can‚Äôt wait for them to open its branch at The Metropolis where my work....I just want the 6 inch tacos back por favor! The 4 inches cant give me the happines I was getting from 6 inches. #NoPunIntended (:

Good service and good food. I loved the half roased chicken, it had a nice texture and flavout to it. The people working here and the one that served us are really nice people. The food was nice the people who served us was nice everything was nice! Good Job

Barrio by Mex Out Sommerset is a terrific place. My kids love their amazing quezzadilla and chicken so much. It‚Äôs a great day to start the year right with a delicious and great dinner and service in this great restaurant. It‚Äôs serving a lot of different Mexican sumptuous dishes which will truly melt your mouth not to mention their very good mango margarita. We will surely be back. Come and visit Barrio by Mex Out it‚Äôs really worth your time and money!!!

Not spicy food ! We went for Sunday lunch - not crowded; ordered Burrito and Salad - decent and filling quantity. Sauce was not spicy. We also ordered coffee - turned out to be very strong ! Overall - satisfying.

I am here as a tourist and I'm amaze by the service that the staff provide and the food served! (: I love the pork tortitas and key lime pie (: the staff were great and the manager is very kind, they were very helpful and initiative! The margarita was superb..

Ordered all their diff meat tacos, chicken , pork, beef, prawn & fishThe fish tacos stood out....the meat was fresh & fried until crispy like good fish and chips (they should consider serving fish & chips)The others was ok la....if the beef should be tender than it would be better but it was almost like beef jerky like texture.Also Order corn and rice side dish.. the more I ate it the better it tasted.

Barrios by Mexout used to be one of our favourite quick but cozy dinner place for having a juicy taco or crispy nachos after work. Since they have changed the menu, it is different. The 4 tacos you get now instead of 3 are much smaller and they are now made from corn instead of wheat. This leads into a full-stomach feeling after 3 pieces but the taste remains without body. They also put cheese from the tube on top which is by far not authentic but rather cheap. They also don't serve the soft drinks in the fancy metal cups anymore but in regular "IKEA" glasses. They even changed the hot sauce and became less spicy but more coriander taste. It is a pity..
5
the service staffs is very friendly. Food is service quick but is warm. Good service and good food. A very lively atmosphere.
5
I ordered the burrito bowl based on my friend's recommendation because I was hungry. Boy did I not regret it because it is super filling!!! The prices are worth it for the portion they give. Would visit again with more friends!!
5
Food is AAA-wesome!!!! Service was even better when a Filipina named Mylen helped out.. My husband and I will definitely be back!

Cosy place for the delicious Mexican food, friendly staff...been here few time and will be back again
5
Helpful and friendly staff. Definitely a great place for quality Mexican food and to gather with friends!

Ordered the 1-for-1 taco menu with 4 tacos per person, from the new menu. The tacos were tiny, dry, the filling was dry, there was no sauce for half the tacos (only chopped onion and cilantro), which just made it worse, and even 4 tacos per person was not enough to satisfy a moderate hunger, where I used to be full from only 2 on the old menu. They had the best carne asada previously, but now it's just sad

Stopped here for a quick bite and a drink. The setting is quite nice, just sitting back and watching the world go by. It is quite a relaxed place and the food and drinks are quite good as well. The staff are friendly and overall a nice eatery to visit

We really enjoyed our dinner here. It's so conveniently located for after - shopping munchies, and the food really hit the spot and satisfied our Mexican cravings! The drinks were reasonably priced and delicious as well. Staff are friendly and helpful, plus we didn't have to wait too long for a seat either! I'll definitely be back with more people in future.

I used to go to Mex Out at MBFC regularly for lunch, and really liked their product. However today I ordered a Chicken Burrito which was bland and pretty much full of rice and very little of any other fillings. I struggled to finish it, it was so tasteless and boring. Really disappointed as was looking forward to a tasty fresh burrito, but now I feel yucky. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know whether a one off or if this place has really got so poor

Read the reviews about rude staff and thought they might of taken the feedback and improved. NO, the staff was very rude and immature.The food was also tasteless. The salsa was a runny liquid and the guacamole had big chunks of avocado. They also missed a dish, no water, and the waitress never came back to check on us. By far the not worth it!!
