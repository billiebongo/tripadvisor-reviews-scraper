We ordered delivery through Uber Eats (which makes it more expensive), but it was nice to have the convenience of delivering to our hotel. We had hour and sour noodle soup, prawn rolls, chop chicken and noodle and vegetables in oyster sauce. It was all very tasty and delivered warm.

This is a small shop located in International Building along Orchahrd Road. They have been open for many years and specialize in dumplings and la mien.We ordered the Xiao long bao, pot stickers and steam dumpling. The skin was thin and the filling was very tasty. The house specialty fried chicken with special sauce was also very flavorful. The Ja Jiang mien was excellent as the sauce was thick and came with generous amount of minced meat. The noodle was cooked "al dente".I will definitely come back here again

A small little shop in the heart of orchard road (next to Thai Embassy). The furnishings are functional but the food is simply delish. The xiao long pao is juicy with a delicate skin. The fried dumplings are crisp and the jellyfish appetizer is exotically different. If you like Chinese Shanghai food then this is a must try.
