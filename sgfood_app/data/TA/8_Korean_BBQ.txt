Standard environment with average Korean fare. Staff were competent but not extravagant. Worth a try but not unlikely for repeat visits.
4
the food was good with generous portions. The ventilation could be improved though as we still smell like walking bbq after dinner.
5
Enjoy friend gathering there with delicious food, nice ambience. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Good service.
5
Great food. The pork was spectacular and so was the soup. The service was also very friendly and kids enjoyed the food as well. Will be back again.
4
Overall a bit pricey. Average price per diner was $50 but the pork belly is definitely worth a try..
5
Tried the 8 flavour set and staff was very helpful with explaining how to eat the pork bellies (eat from mildest to strongest in taste so you could taste each flavour).
4
The food is average, if to compare with the price paid. A bit pricey than average. The service was good. Very attentive despite peak hours.
4
Been to the place a couple of times. They serve good korean BBQ pork and unique Makgoelli. Good to come in groups as can try more flavors.
4
The staff are well trained to cook the meat just right. The marination of the meat is done nicely too. There are also a good range of alcohol.
4
A last minute decision to have BBQ food on a Friday night with my family. Our first time there, I commend their service were good but slightly slow in serving or ordering due to shortage of staff. The lady who served us gave good recommendation, we had the Flower Pot Set (a choice of 2 flavours Pork Belly, Pork Neck and Pork Jowl plus top-up of $6.00 for army stew). The garlic and miso taste good. The meal just nice for 3 of us unless you are a big meat-eater, I would suggest the 4 flavours with add-on. I will come back to try the other 6 flavours for sure. =
5
Service was excellent. Ambience is better then the one at Central. Was a little disappointed when informed that 4 marinate was not available for the pork as we wanted to order the 8 selection.Overall very happy with our meal.
3
Like the overall concept and ambience... ordered 4 flavours set, marination can be stronger though, could not really taste the difference... meats are also too fatty for my liking... maybe coming back maybe not, yet to try the beef set
4
8 flavoured grilled pork is a must order
the service is great
free flow bean sprouts is delicious
a little expensive though
4
Didn't have to lift a finger, staff took care of the bbq-ing and cooking of stew entirely.
Very flavorful pork bellies as well but skip the stew if possible unless you are into salty food.
4
The food & drinks are great.
But there's a bit of inconvenient as they dun recognize my reservation via chope. Have to rush out & eat as there's another reservation after they gave us the table.
5
Friendly staff, tasty food! The seafood stew that came free with the pork set we ordered were superb, with 1 free refill as well!
5
Nice place for small family of 4 to dine in, service was excellent even though its a bit on the high side on the ala carte.
2
We ordered several dishes. The 8 cuts of pork delivered to our table looked nothing like the photographs of it and comprised 70% fat- in short it was awful. Cheap meat dished up to con the customer.The ribeye was good.The Farmers stew was just junk thrown into a broth or stock cube. Luncheon meat and bits of Vienna sausages with ramen style noodlesThe waitresses were trying their best but were hopelessly understaffed and struggled to keep up with the demands of the floor. Not one of our servers smiles or engaged with us and they need further training if they can expect to get tips or this dump to last much longer.Seats are as uncomfortable as sitting on oil drums.Decor is grim.There is far better value for money to be had in the Korean food court downstairs.Donâ€™t waste your money here
4
Service wise was great, server will cook and grill all the meats and stew and all that was left was for patrons to dig in and enjoy the meal. However the Hungarian pork was not as smooth and flavourful as anticipated, did not taste much difference in the flavoring despite trying all the 8 flavors and meat texture was mediocre. Nevertheless the meal was satisfying and reasonable priced at $30 per pax in group of 6 ordering the 8 flavours pork set that came with pot of stew(seafood tofu stew was flavorful) and additional order of their house brew yuzu makgolli
5
Was really impressed with the quality of the meat here. The staff was very thoughtful and considerate as well. We wanted to order the 8 treasures but she stopped us saying that this order would usually feed 4 to 5 people and advised us to take the 4 treasures instead. Would definitely come back again when I get my cravings again!
5
Great place to have K.BBQ with friends & family.
Good quality meat and the shop provided assistant with cooking of the meats.
3
The bibimbap, and the army stew are worth returning to.
The marinated pork, supposedly the signature dish of this restaurant, is just, in my opinion, average.
Not cheap; 91sgd for two persons.
4
Food is tasty but pricing in the high side. The pork belly getting way too fatty this time round, not sure if it is due to seasonal reasons. Service and ambience good as usual.
5
Food and service is good. Will definitely be back again ! Brought a friend and glad that she enjoyed!
5
The quality of the food here is really good! Love the flavours pork. Service is also top notch. Staff were very attentive.
5
Food price maybe on the expensive side but the service is fantastic. Our serve did her best to accommodate us despite having to serve about 4 more other tables. what a legend. :)
4
We ordered the $58 set which comes with 4 flavour pork and a stew.As recommended by the service staff, we had the Garlic, Wine, Kalbi and Red Pepper marinated pork. The staff did the bbq for us. Garlic was a miss. The rest have stronger taste, in particular, we like Kalbi. It's actually Korean soy sauce. We also had their beef stew. it was good, but not spicy. The taste is also not very strong. Overall, it was a good dining experience
4
i like visiting this place as it can accommodate large group and the food is nice too! you can put your bags into the hidden compartment of the stool which helps to filter out the bbq smell. there are 8 different seasoning of the pork. they serve a variety of makgeolli and soju and i like the yucha & honey flavour.
4
Ambience of the restaurant is nice. Service was really good. Staff was very attentive and they will help u cook the meat. We ordered the colourful pork belly. The meat marination was good but felt it was too fatty. Not much meat in it. Ginseng chicken soup was good too but the seafood stew falls short of standard. Prices abit high side.
1
The 4 strips of pork belly that I ordered had very little lean meat compared to my previous visit when I ordered the exact same thing. When I asked the staff about this, her response was that during the winter season, the pork belly strips tend to contain more fat than usual due to the animals’ lack of mobility. She suggested that I order the pork neck next time as it is leaner than the pork belly. I would have appreciated being informed, at the time I placed my order, about the pork belly containing more fat than usual, instead of only finding out afterwards and having to throw away so much of the pork belly strips I ordered (and in the case of the strip right at the bottom in the attached photos, it was practically the entire strip). It’s no use telling me afterwards that I should have ordered the pork neck instead
3
Not my first time to 8 Korean BBQ. Was decent place for Korean bbq though it burns pocket a little. Happy that it's in Orchard, for a change.
4
8 Color set is delicious and service staff help to bbq for customers which is good. The must try is ginseng chicken soup, soup is thick n flavourful, chicken tender and yummy. We will go back again
2
Service was far from expected as compared to period when the restaurant initially started.
Quality of army stew was 2 thumbs down and the Argentinian ribeye tasted lousier than the cheaper US short rib.
It was my 2nd visit and the last!
2
Poor service. Not much selection. Only pork belly meat is available. The meat is too fatty, ended up we didn't eat all. Very pricey.
4
If you love Korean bbq you will love this place. Food is always good although a tad pricey. We have been here many times. Really really wish they were more generous with the banchan in tens of quantity and variety.
4
Been here many times and will keep coming back. Food quality and service is good as always. Maybe menu can be expand with more choices
4
It was our first time there and the food and service were both great. Overall it was a great experience! :)
5
It was my first time dining at 8 and I must say it was a rather pleasant experience. The waitresses were very helpful and polite. The ambience was great for a night out with friends and the price was reasonable.
4
The kimchi was so delicious. The service staff explained the dishes patiently to us. She was really knowledgeable about the food. The food was tasty as well !
4
The pork belly could be less fatty as the whole piece was fat and no meat, big disappointment. The previous visit was better, will ask for more lean ones nxt time. The army stew is better compared to the seafood stew. The steam egg is nothing special, can give it a miss
4
Its always fun to come here in a group. The service is personal, the meats are delicious, the overall vibe and experience is great. I'd come back again.
3
Very authentic place feels like in Korea. A little pricy but the meat is tasty. The tofu soup not as nice. Nice environment.
5
It is one of the hiding place at Orchard road when I want to eat with peace from the crowded Orchard . Staff there are very friendly and accommodating to my request . I love raw garlic and they alway provide me when I requested
3
Average Korean BBQ but very expensive price tags. Love the smokeless environment though and wait staff Vanessa was a rare gem
4
Not a bad place to dine with a couple of friends, not so much family. There also seems to be a shortage of staff? Nevertheless, a pleasant dinjng experience.
5
Fast replies. Accomodating to special requests . Excellent service and friendly staffs! Overall was good!
4
The waiting can be long without a reservation but food was superb. It comes with a soup when you order 4/8 bbq pork.
5
Food was delicious. Looks like they have shortage of manpower over all friendly and helpful staff trying their very best to handle all tables orders.
2
The side dishes were tiny, and we had to ask for more lettuce and kimchi twice because nobody was paying attention to us. The meat portions were also very small. We were still hungry after eating all the items we had ordered, but our young waitress was rushing around serving 5 other tables, and we didn't want to add to her stress by ordering another round of food, so we just paid and left. The food itself was tasty enough, but would have been better cooked over charcoal rather than on the iron plates used in this restaurant
3
Unlike the different pork offerings here, the beef (we ordered the Argentine and US ones) are NOT marinated, so they taste a little bland for me. The 'stew' is nice, but not the yummiest kimchi soup we've had. Very dedicated Filipina service staff. Restaurants located on the upper floors of Shaw Centre need a lot of luck to succeed. Quality alone is not sufficient as this is such a low-traffic area. No wonder they're called 8 Korean, Lucky 8, Small Plates (La Taperia), et
4
Price is quite steep but you pay for the quality and service. The pork belly is nice but the beef is average unless you order the wagyu grade. Staff will cook for you.
4
First time there. Ordered the 8 flavours, the staff will state individually each flavour before she BBQ for us.
Chicken Thigh taste is also superb.
Overall service is good too.
2
Bought Chope voucher and though we order non promo items they refused to let us order promo items even though we say we pay cash for them. When we were not done yet, we were told to pay bill.
4
Location is good. Setting of restaurant is fine. Staff service can be slightly better. Food are tasty but abit pricey.
Chairs have no back rest so for some may not be comfortable.
4
this is one of our fav Korean BBQ restaurant. It can get a bit noisy sometimes. Love the food. Service is good
4
Even though the food was slightly pricey, it was really delectable. There were standards in both the quality of the food as well as the staff. :)
4
The service turned out poor when there is more people coming to the restaurant. Asked for refill of soup base and waited for more than half an hour to come. Have to also asked for several times to refill the vege. The food was good though.
3
Ambience was quite dark.. and we (3pax)requested to sit at the back as the restaurant only consists of 1 table clients. Staff said was closed and they r afraid cant see client if seated behind. So in the 1st place, why did they have tables behind? Appetizer was little in each plate although is refillable. We need to ask the staff for refill. Ordered the 4 color meat at $48, meat is quite fatty and slight hard. Overall, experience was average.
4
Food was great, tasted delicious! We made a reservation so we were able to get a good seat. The only thing that I wish could improve is the service from the staff. They didn't look very happy serving us food and there were times their service was a little delayed. But because the food was delicious, all was well.
4
Food is good but slightly on the pricey side. The visit was on a weekday evening at about 6pm so there was no crowd. The service was rather good as well with the waitress cooking the meat for us and explaining to us where the meat were from and when to eat it best. Overall experience was good!
4
We had five types of pork belly with beef kimchi paste/soup, coupled with a 750 ml bowl (yes, not bottle) of original flavor rice wine. I would say that the overall experience was lively with good humble service fro the crew.
5
I must say I love the food but not the price. Must order the pork belly. Service was good too. Soju was nice too.
5
awesome pork belly. good quality. will definitely come back again next time for more!! good and attentive service crew as well
4
The waitresses were well mannered and friendly, which made the whole dining experience very pleasant! Really enjoyed the army stew, the BBQ meat however was just normal.
4
I think the friendly staff make the whole dinning experience more memorable . I believe I will go back again soon .
3
It was probably Sunday evening, not many patrons. Attentive service. Meat marination is not the usual Korean type. Taste a little blend to me.
5
Have been there twice before. Great service, good food. Some flavours of pork a lot better than others.
5
Been to the other outlet a few times, decided to bring a friend to try it out too. Certainly didnt disappoint, food was great, service made the experience even better.
3
Had read a few review of e place n decide to go for it. There was no ginseng taste in e chicken,kimchesse fried rice was just plain.lastly the 8 colour pork was well over rated n pricey.
4
This is now my go to place for Korean BBQ. Not the cheapest in town but the staff will do the grilling to make sure non of the yummy meat is overcooked and wasted. Besides the meat, my favourite part is actually the BBQ bean sprouts that's served as a side and the soft onions. The staff was also very nice in offering to cook the beef to well done for my young child and cutting it into bite size pieces. Try the army stew and pancake too! Best to book especially for dinner as they are usually ful
4
Good experience. But food portion is too large for 2 person. 3 or 4 people gathering is more suitable !
4
good food tho portion is small...can increase portion.. service is average.. location is hard to find
4
Fantastic venue with great food. The staff were very helpful and the food was superb!
Definitely not a place to eat and run😄
5
Tried their 8 flavours of pork and found it was wonderfully marinated. Side dishes and kimchi pancake were very good as well
4
Despite the fact that the restaurant was short-handed, the staff did a great job in ensuring that we were still well attended to and always with a smile.
3
Everything about this place was average. Nothing bad but nothing amazing. The food was good and the service was good but nothing special. Solid B effort.
5
Our first time at the Shaw outlet. The food was fantastic with premium mangalitsa pork, ribeye and very fresh grilled squid. The meal was made better by the fantastic team of servers who were friendly and attentive and made our dining experience a wonderful one.
3
Ordered : 8Colour Set & U.S Beef Prime Rib. Quality of meats were fantastic and considering that, the prices are value for money. Side dishes were lacklusture, and in small portions, i.e.: 3 pieces of baby potatoes for a table of 4 and no refill. You can find better banchan elsewhere. Kimchi and bean sprouts kimchi were not too bad. As with most Korean BBQ joints, the service staff will offer to cook the meats for you but usually as I prefer to do my own grilling I requested to do so but was told by the service staff that I CAN'T do so. Tts shocking, as a customer don't I have the rights to choose to do my own grilling?! As these are really great cuts of meats. The service staff took over and as expected the first 4 slabs of meats were ruined. The grill was not hot and a piece of wax paper was placed atop the meats to prevent oil splatters but that resulted in a steaming effect of the meats. BBQ-ing of meats should have a prefect slight char on the outside and still juicy on the inside. But what we got were steamed pork bellies that greatly disappointed due to poor grilling skills. When she came along the second round, I insisted that I would really prefer to cook it myself to prevent future wreckage to such great pieces of meat. Don't know if it's a hard and fast rule? I'm aware she's just doing her job but if you're in a BBQ joint and can't do a good job at grilling meats, why can't we as customers DIY instead?She came to check on us a few times and kept lowering the heat on the grill affecting the heat required to cook the meats and I was told off by her as she said high heat will result in damage of the hotplate?!!!If this was so then why choose such a piece of equipment that would easily damage under high heat if you're running a BBQ Joint?!!!!!We visited on a Sat evening and it was crowded and packed as usual so the way we were served and how she cooked the meat for us was done in a way that seemed rushed and without much care. If the standard protocol is that customers are not allowed to cook their own meats and only the service staff are allowed to do the cooking, I would not return. But if management can clarify their stand on this, the quality of meats is worth a return visit.
4
Went with family for lunch, we were the first customers of the day as our reservation was at 1130am. The manager was very attentive and explained the products and recommended serving portions suitable for 4. The 4 flavours pork was simply thumbs up! Seafood soup was complimentary with the order of the pork belly set, and portion was sufficient for us. Pancake was served hot and crispy! But didn't quite enjoy the squid, was pretty normal to us. Overall was a good dining experience, will return again
5
It's our second visit at 8 Korean BBQ, Clarke Quay Central Outlet.No trip is complete without having their 8 Colours Set ($98) that came with 8 thick strips of Mangalitza Pork Belly, free-flow Kimchi and Beansprouts, and their signature Seafood Soft Tofu stew (which we were recommended). The meats were flavorful and juicy. Love the kimchi so much that we had second serving of it too!Also shared the humongous Bibimbap Bingsu ($28) among three of us.The shaved ice was on the milkier side, and topped with many ingredients. Would prefer it less milky and more fluffy
5
Food is good, service is good. Staff is very attentive and generous with portions. Love their home brew makgeolli
5
Been here a couple of times, always enjoyed the tasty meats and good service from staff. Great place for groups and casual catch ups.
4
We were impressed by the service of the staff. They were attentive to our needs despite the busy night. The portion size was sufficient but a tad pricey. It was a thoughtful concept to keep the belongings away (hidden) in the steel seat
5
Ordered the 8 different flavours of their Mangalitza pork belly for 3 of us, portion is just nice. Food is yummy and service is excellent.
5
The place was well-furnished, nice lighting with great stuff attending you. A great place for family gather as its spacious enough up to 10. Just one issue, the deco blocks the tv..... #kthxbye
4
The food was good and the service was exceptional. It was a Friday night but they were attentive, quick to refill the side dishes etc. The price was a little on the high side compared to those at Tanjong Pagar but the service was much much better. Great ventilation too.. did not come out smelly
4
We could not get an earlier dinner reservation at the Shaw Center and so tried the one at Clark Quay Central instead. Although I could not differentiate all the eight flavored pork, I enjoyed the meal and the $6 top up to change the stew portion of the package to army stew is worth it. The Volcano fried rice is ok. My daughters loved the choco loco dessert.Only disappointment is the side dishes. Had better side dishes at other Korean bbq restaurants
5
The staffs were friendly and attentive. Prompt to top up the Korean side dishes. The staffs are BBQ professionals, they placed a piece of special type of paper over the meats to prevent the oil from splattering. We orderd the famous 8 flavours of pork belly and squid. They were grilled to near perfection! Serving size is recommended for 5-6 people.Highly recommend to order Yuzu soju rice wine, goes well with the meat! Army stew was highly recommended as well. Will visit this place again for the beef and other Korean cooked food. It's one of the best Korean BBQ in Singapore.
5
Love their selections of meats here and how they throw in a stew pot as part of the package. The army stew is perfectly balanced and smartly done using kimchi base. The only disappointment is with the steam egg that is pricey and not to my taste.Overall, a place for multiple revisits! Thank you
4
Visited the BBQ restaurant at Shaw Center and tried their signature 8 variations of pork. They tasted pretty similar, except for the Miso flavoured pork which was really salty. Their beef stew was very simple and I wouldn't recommend to order it. However, the seafood pancake was very delicious. Pretty nice place for gatherings, I'd say
5
We ordered 1-for-1 pork jowl & pork neck. The pork jowl is amazing!! But the pork neck is quite hard. Overall it's a good place to enjoy good korean food and meet-up with friends.
4
Celebrated my best friend's birthday and her wedding anniversary. We all love the place as it is spacious, food are good, staffs are attentive and fun loving. Place to stuff your bags without taking up space...
4
First time to Shaw Centre outlet, prebiously went Clarke Quay Central outlet many times before. Service at Shaw Centre is not as good. Food wise is not bad but rather costly.
4
Not as crowded as in Central Clarke. However food quality is same. But prefer the ambience at the Central one.
3
Made my reservation via the chope app. The food was not awesome but the meat was decent. However, we were well served by the crews and we appreciated it.
4
Went to the Shaw center outlet.
Service is good and everyone enjoyed the food especially the short ribs!
3
We went on the chope offer of buy 1 get 1 pork jowl/neck special. For $38/serve of either, the portion was very small and overpriced. If not for the 1 for 1 offer we would have felt very ripped off. The pan-chan was also stingy, 3 small potatoes and tiny little pickle services, the service staff gave us only the seaweed when we asked for a top up of the dishes. That being said, the lady who barbecued the meat for us was very kind and patient to explain to my kids what the exhaust pipe did. Overall we did enjoy ourselves but won't be going back since there are plenty of other Korean options.
4
The restaurant is tuck in a corner on the fourth level, which can be hard to locate if unfamiliar with the mall layout. When we arrived; 7pm on a Tuesday, it wasn't too crowded but the crowd picked up slowly during our visit. Service was cordial and addressed all our questions about portion size and what to order etc politely and patiently. We ordered the pork cheek and belly set along with the add on ($6) 'soldier's stew'. Along with what we ordered are the standard side dishes that would be offered as with any Korean restaurant. The side dishes were well made and the Kimchi stood out. The soldiers stew wasn't of value as there is little ingredients in it. On the other hand, the grilled meats were well marinated, seasoned and of good quality. The staff actually cooked all of the meat for us and does the same for other tables as well. The vegetable used for wrapping the meat is constantly being topped up as well. The portions were great for 2. I feel for that for the price we paid more should be in order. That being said. The staff were amazing and so was the service.
2
What we really didn't like about this restaurant was that the food was way off from an authentic Korean restaurant. The BBQ was average but the doenjang jigae (된장찌개) and side dishes (반찬) were not very tasty, and so unlike what we've eaten at numerous restaurants in South Korea and at other ajumma restaurants in Singapore. Perhaps this may be a good option for those looking for a more modern, fusion-type Korean dining experience
5
The food was delicious, especially the waggu beef. However, it is the exception service by one of the staff that made the lunch even better. She was attentive and even though she was so busy serving 4 other tables, she helped bbq our food and did not complain when we asked for extra side dishes or more butter on our beef. Best service staff ever! Too bad I did not get her name
5
Food is good, staff is attentive and very flexible in their menu. A small suggestion whereby to provide complimentary drinking water to patrons would make the meal even perfect.
4
last Sunday my friend and I go to Korean8 BBQ. The 8 colors pork set is interesting and tasty. The service is also not bad.
5
Celebrated my birthday with my family and would definitely do this next year. Place was intimate enough for a small gathering.
4
Generous amount of food but lacked flavour and spiciness in comparison to the inexpensive bbq places you get in Seoul. Still a very pleasant experience, the staff was wonderful and all provided great service.
5
Pre booked and the friendly staff took the initiative to WhatsApp to confirm my reservation. Service was Good. Food is good. Recommended.
5
Great food with super great service. Servers were attentive through the meal and meat was delicious. Would probably visit again
2
There was no music it was too quiet when I ask the waiter to on some music ,she told me that they are having a staff meeting!!The heat of the wok is unbearable !!When they drop the ice cream on the dessert they don't even bother to change a new one they just scoop a scoop of ice cream onto a side bowl to replace it !!!!
5
Clark Quay Central is very near too town.This outlet has an authentic korean atmosphere, by all the korean songs and table set layout. I came with my UOB mastercard points redemption, hence there was discounted price.Generous food portion, be it army stew or variety of marinated meat cut - in herb, garlic, wine, korean bbq sauce and more. It is rare to see pan fried kimchi in SG too.The friendly staffs had voluntarily provided garlic for meat wrap- when my friend and i were just chatting and not requesting about it.Lastly, its staff will do the frying for you. Hence minimal hassle
5
The staffs texted to confirm the reservation on the day itself. Hassle-free reservation, changes and confirmation. Warmly welcome by staff, explained what they are serving and the sequence in eating the BBQ to bring out the best of the dish.Food is yummy. Am sure to visit again
4
- Service is great.- Nice ambience.- Excellent BBQ meat (ordered 8 colour set, a stew comes with it)- Very nice kimchi, generous with it when putting on top of bbq plate to heat it up- ordered squid to BBQ, 1 of the nicest BBq squid I had tasted.- Steamed egg was creamy at the top but slightly hard at the bottom- Ordered US Prime Beef, it was nice.- Good service from the staff, was attentive and took time out to explain the origins of the BBQ pork.Cons:- Seating was a bit low and the exhaust pipe was low, hit my head as a result.- 5 variety of side dish only (small portion and as a result, has to ask for refills countless times but the staff do it with a smile
4
Located in Orchard - centralised place to meet up with your friends and the food and service was good. Just that it's common for you to smell bad after the Korean BBQ.
4
Nice food and beverage , service personnel are quite attentive. Flexible to make arrangements when I feedback that I am not able to complete dinner in 1.5 hours to release table
4
Food is good and well marinated meat. Except the serving of the vegetables can be more each time... The yu cha makgeoli is a must order.
5
1) quick in showing us to the table
2) recommendations from the menu
3) professional explanation while providing barbecue service for our orders
4) prompt refills of sides
5) soup refills available
Overall great experience, value for money and excellent Korean taste👍🏼
4
Sooo delicious. You can feel the pork flying in your mouth. Pork jowl and neck are good too. I like the herb sauce pork belly. A little pricy though.
5
This isn't your typical Korean bbq restaurant where you have a full menu of meats and side dishes to choose from. It's mainly pork like big pieces of thick bacon marinated in various flavors like miso and soy sauce. It was a bit confusing when we sat down being first timers. But the smell of sizzling pork all around us was saliva inducing to say the least. My friend isn't really a foodie so he couldn't even taste the difference between the pork marinades but he gobbled everything up nonetheless. I was a bit disappointed in the free side dishes cuz I'm not much of a meat eater and usually rely on those dishes to fill my tummy. We ordered the mushrooms which was yummy too. I was especially impressed by the fact that the staff came around to cook all the food for us. How they managed to time it all so perfectly without bribing anything is beyond me. I just wish they had some bulgolgi on the menu...
4
This is my 3rd visit to the restaurant; last 2 visits within the same week!Love the BBQ Pork with various marinations and army stew! Not forgetting the refillable kimichi and beansprouts! Definitely great place for friends gathering. If with children, good to visit over the weekend afternoons
4
The food is great! Te tastiest korean meat bbq I ever had!! Staff are friendly oo. The price? Say we have ordered this set with 4 slices of pork belly, with unlimited side dish 1 soju and 2 beer and paid for like USD 100!!! Place is nice too since it is across Clarke Quay
4
The restaurant was quite empty when we reach. service were gd and staff were attentive. Place is easy to find. We ordered the 8 Flavour pork belly set, gd for 3 ppl even though we were told its for 5ppl. The set comes with a soup worth $18 which you can choose from the menu (only soup price at $18) and there are a few selections. Food is tasty. overall not bad
4
Had the 4 colour plate set, however the taste of pork exist for the original flavour, beside that, the rest wasn't too bad. The army stew was close to shin ramen brand of instant noodle, kind of disappointing. Beef short ribs wise was excellent. Taste was simple seasoning of salt and pepper, the meat was tender and nice
4
Staff were attentive and friendly. We ordered the 8 flavours with army stew and yuzu makgoli. Tasty and pleasant experience. Will definately return again!
4
Other than the delay of our bingsu order which took more than 45 mins to arrive, everything was great.
3
Service was pretty slow despite the restaurant not being so packed. Food was average but decently priced.
4
Food was very good and staff was very friendly and offer to bbq for us and we just need to sit and enjoy the food.
4
Definitely one of the better Korean BBQs around. The meats were well seasoned. But what set this apart was the attention of the staff. We had very personable​ professionals who explained the process and choices patiently. Will be back.
5
Good food and the staff are really friendly and attentive. Love the seafood soft tofu stew. A must to order.
4
Waitress was patient when we were ordering and was able to advise on choice and amount of food to order. Reassured us that she was going to take care of us. However, the experience is inconsistent.
4
Tried the 4 flowers pork, army stew, and egg omelette. The 4 flavours of meats include original, curry, herb and garlic. Meat, side dishes and omelette tasted real good, army stew is normal. Besides that, able to put my stuff inside my seat so my bag will not smell of BBQ. Overall good experience, will go back again.

The pork is exactly as recommended by other reviewers. The sides are also fantastic. The downsides (if we thought could improve) would be the exhaust (there is no suction) to extract the fume from the BBQ don't seem to be working. Hence, we'll go out smelled grilled

On top of the delicious meats, the service here made the whole dining experience a great one. Thanks to the staff's recommendations and help on the barbecuing, my friend and I had a very enjoyable and tasty meal.

Comparable to Korea, but without the snow outside and the charcoal inside. Innovative tilted BBQ plates. Pork better than the beef... Must try the yucha makgeolli. Even non-lovers will love it!
4
Good, but I was at the door for awhile before they notice me. I was late, but they served me with smile...
5
Enjoyed ourselves totally at the place! The service was great. The lady was very helpful in recommending the food and helped us to cook the meal. Highly recommended for the Korean fans!

Food is good and value for money.
Downside: smell very bad after meal; the bbq smell all over your hair and clothes.
5
It's one of the authentic korean bbq in Singapore, although the price is on the high side. However, the quality of the food will make it all worthwhile.
3
I think it's ok food. But the portions and the signature pork collars are kind of average. I can't really taste the difference between different flavours
4
The signature pork belly was well flavored and neatly grilled. We tried the black chicken ginseng soup as well, that was superb! Plump chicken, thick soup filled with a variety of nuts and other aromatics - truly a royal recipe! Service was attentive but could be more friendly

the last visit to this restaurant was at their Clarke Quay Central branch. I wonder what took me so long to return...and return I did!Awesome foodAwesome service crew by the 2 youngsters Awesome ambience Awesome 8 flavors of pork Awesome pancake! (I was telling my friends about the disastrous past 2 pancakes I had at 2 Korean outlets and how glad I was to finally had a decent and more than decent pancake!)Nothing much can screw up here and the only thing I wish it could do better is the steam egg. At a hefty price of $12, it didn't match what I preferred @ superstar K.But whatever it is, it couldn't denied the otherwise almost perfect experience we had here.Be back soon! And thank you for being awesome

We ordered the Flower Pork Set, which came with 3 types of pork so we got to try a variety! The set also comes with a soup, and we chose the seafood tofu one, which was very fresh and good! The beansprouts, kimchi and mushrooms on the side were really yummy and complemented the meat as well! We also got the passionfruit makgeolli that was delicious (: the service was also top-notched where the food was cooked for us well and explanations of the different types of meat were given despite being short-handed. Overall it was a great experience!
4
Good quality food with great service. Would be better if seats can be with backrest for old folks. Price is good with promotions.
2
Food was terrible. Paid so much to eat pure fats. And whats with 8 flavours? Could taste none of that. Dont recommend this place at all. Ud find much better at some food courts.
3
Unfortunately or fortunately, the best dishes were the banchan. The beef was tough and the seafood stew was bland. Overall, it was a disappointing meal that was pricey. We left feeling disappointed.
5
Pork belly was really good especially the red pepper flavoured one. Staff were attentive and friendly. Pricey but worth it!
3
i saw heaps of reviews about how good the service and food! i admire the service, is good! but unfortunately not the food! to me, the mangalitsa pig was not fantastic! ordinary and the stew average
i would not recommend or visit again
4
Great service and the flavours of the meat is so good. I will highly recommend my friends to try it out.
4
Their signature pork bellies with 8 different seasonings were good - must try! Topped additional $ for an Army Stew which was fulfilling too. But their seafood pancake so-so only, wished it could be crispier.
5
Its pork galore, those who don't eat beef have lotsa of selection of pork here.the 8 flavor pork was too much as advise by the staff. For a group of 5 , we were told that 4 colours pork is more then enough or could be already too much.We also order the army pot. ( to those who ate in korea, this is a much different taste. its less spicy here)Other then the 8 flavors pork, the ginseng chicken is a must to drink. Its as good as the tosokchon ginseng chicken from seoul. Try it first as the soup for SG version is super thick
4
My 2nd visit to their outlet Central @ Clarke Quay. Their staff never fails to provide guest with nicely done BBQ meat despite a crowd, we just need to simply sit back and relax. We went for the 4 FLAVOURS set, which comes with a stew, Kimchi, beansprouts and a couple of sides, very affordable and well worth( great for 2-3 pax). Will be back to try the better grade meat =

We dined here on New Year's eve, i made reservations for 7pm for the 7 of us.6 of us arrived at 6.57pm and the last person on the way, the guy at the restaurant refused to give us our table saying that the restaurant was full! Not like we don't have a reservation hello!He let us in in the end.The rest of the evening was great. Food was prepared well at the table and the Makgeolli was excellent. We had 2 jugs of yuzu and one passion and the Yuzu flavouredone was a whole lot tastier
5
Good service, and good food! Excellent experience for my friend's birthday celebration! Will definitely return for more. :)
4
The meat was well Marinated with different flavours. Service crew will assist to cook like in a typical korean restaurant.
3
It was a little disappointing at first as the restaurant had missed out on our reservation. The pork belly could be more flavourful as we couldn't really taste the difference btw the 8 flavours. Only the curry was more prominent.
4
I like the food of 8 Korean BBQ, and also the full service of this restaurant. Staff are friendly and price are reasonable, the food there is in quality.
5
Nice and good quality food... they got excellent service for their customers..
Easy to find the places...
4
I thought the food and service was pretty good. The pork flavors were unique too. I will visit the restaurant again in the future.
3
If you simply love pork, as in pork belly, pork jowl, you might like that place. The restaurant looks very nice from the outside but its not. They have very uncomfortable seats too. Honestly, even seoul garden is better than them.

booked 6.30pm and arrived 6.50pm. earlier a lady called to confirm reservation and informed the latest arrival would be 6.40pm if not table would be given to other diners. gave her the understanding. was in a movie before dinner and rushed there to find no seats available. told us that we may need to wait til 7.30pm or 8pm but no guarantee. we waited outside the restaurant and the male-in-charge informed us that we can take a table but have to end at 8pm. therefore we had a rushed 1hr dinner. a pretty lady served us, helped us to grilled the meats. overall the staffs were very friendly esp the manager and the female pretty girl. knew we had limited time so tried to cater to us asap. ordered 4 color meats - wine, red pepper, miso, herb (ginger). wine and miso was quite good. the set included a stew which we chose seafood tofu stew. overall everything was quite good. add on grilled squid @$18++. and soju about $25. overall damage = ~$12
5
The Hungarian pork tasted different from the Indonesian or Malaysian's, although the fat is more from the physical look but it did not taste fatty at all, we had beef kimchi stew, refreshing and light! Ended the meal with their famous Choco loco bingsu, it was really nice, the shaved ice was really fine, the sweetness was just perfect

I came to dine here on Monday. The booking process was smooth, I used the online application for booking (i.e. Quandoo). They gave 6 side dishes (kimchi, korean bean sprout, fried seaweed, pasta salad, and 2 type of korean pickled radish). The fried seaweed is soooo goood! The rest are rather normal. We ordered pork belly with 8 different seasonings. In our opinion, the good ones are garlic, red pepper and miso. If anyone would like to try this place, it is better to order 4 type of seasonings. I guess 8 pork belly is a bit too fatty and you will feel guilty after the dinner. The other good thing is they also gave army stew (with top up $6) which tasted quite good. Please wear dark clothes when you visit this place because the oil splashed everywhere (to my dress, to my green tea, to the table). It is too messy for me, frankly. During my visit, the service was bad. There was a waitress attached to my table who will help to cook the meat and serve us. She did not smile at all. Whenever she started cooking, she need to mention the type of seasonings and it is quite hard for us to catch what she was saying, so, we asked her to repeat. She seemed irritated whenever we asked her to repeat. Overall comment, the food was average, but great presentation. Service wise, should be improved
5
Food is good, service is excellent, very customer oriented and attentive. I had a flu at the start of the meal, they recommended hot tea and even wished me fast recovery when I was leaving, very satisfied with the place.
5
Great service and good food. The crew cooks everything for you so you dont have to lift a finger. I personally like the red pepper pork belly! Great experience though slightly pricey.
4
Their standard of food is there and I really enjoyed it. Nevertheless, they could improve better on their customer service. If their concept is helping you to BBQ your food, they should be more attentive towards customers.
3
The side dishes not so variety and kimchi not nice, so of couse kimchi soup also not nice (got pepery tast!?) Meat fresh but small potion compare to price. Serive was good
5
Excellent food n service... it's our first time to there..
We order 4 pork set with army stew.. we really like the BBQ..
3
Mediocre food. Went with the server's recommendation. The pork was too fatty and under seasoned.. ginseng chicken soup was too thick. Seafood tofu stew was without character. All in all, a letdown.
4
Staffs are friendly and service is good. Celebrated my friend's bday and they made the effort to decorate the plate with some chocolates sauce & mashmallows.

The staff were fairly young and there is a feel of vibrancy and buzz in the general ambience, it sets you to feel relaxed when you join the crowd already dinning. The service is excellent and helps mitigate the concern you may have in figuring out the amount of effort you need to put in to BBQ the range of food on order in their set menu. In most Korean BBQ joints you need to do some cooking , some folks like that , not me! I came to relax and enjoy a meal not to work for my meal. Well it was most heartening that the staff actually cook all the meats for you. The food was excellent and the quality of the meats could be appreciated easily. The only item that i guess needed some getting used to is the Kimchi Rice. It was glutinous in texture and had cheese in it. I am keeping an open mind as to whether it goes well with the meats, i am not completely discounting it negatively but, guess the 'Jury' is out on this item the rest of the food was great. I will return to this restaurant without hesitation. I recommend you strongly.

First of all, it was my first time here and I was on my own at lunch. The BBQ and other meals were big and for a minimum of 2 persons unless you wanted an expensive steak so I opted for one of the hot stone dishes, the "8 colours Bibimbap". The staff explained the 8 concept, which was very helpful and gave me 6 small dishes of nibbles, mostly pickles, while I waited. These were excellent and the service magnificent. The pork dish came and was well presented, 8 separate portions of vegetables and the pork surrounding rice and a fried egg on top. Now for the negatives, of the 8 portions was cucumber, courgette, carrot and some salad leaves. Not a problem in their own right but these dilute flavours, if you get what I mean and the very small portion of fried pork (which was delicious) was insufficient to flavour the whole plate of food, making it bland, despite the seasoning sauce I was given to squirt on top. Far too many vegetables for the small amount of meat in my mind and I needed to season the plate considerably to get some flavour out of it. Maybe if I ordered a double portion of pork, it might have helped but I doubt I would try that one again.DÃ©cor was modern and designed for group/family dining and the server was great but it seemed he was mostly on his own looking after 6-7 tables, so was rushing around like his head was on fire. So not a bad visit but nothing to shout aloud about, save the pickles

The waitress who was taking our order noted that we had ordered a meal for 4 even though we had only 2 people and pointed out to us. She also provided useful recommendations when we asked what was nice even though this was not our first time over there. Throughout our meal, she was very attentive to our requests. She even took the time to explain the nutritional value of the food we ordered. When she was busy serving other tables, she took the effort to call out to other waiters and waitresses to attend to us. The food was also to our satisfaction
