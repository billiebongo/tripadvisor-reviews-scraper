At $16.90 plus GST ($18.10 after tax) for this bowl is kinda pricey. I opted for original salmon and seasonal poke (shrimp). I must say the seasoning was on point. What I dislike is the price does not include GST and serving was small.
2
Good flavours and quality fish. I would often go to the Chevron house branch as I work nearby. After the tiny portion i received today for $18 I will not be going back there. Its a shame as I like the idea.

Fresh ingredients, yummy sashimi cubes but would be better if they were more generous with the portion. Liked their sweetened jap tofu skin, wakame and flying fish roe as topping.
4
Healthy lunches with lots of vege, brown rice and sashimi! Just wished that prices will be lower. Small eatery with limited seats. Uses disposable bowl and cutlery. I will try to bring my own Cutlery on next visit.

Friend introduced me to try the outlet at Citylink Mall. Ordered Poke Bowl and love their fresh vegetables and the seasoned & spicy salmon that taste really good.
4
Ordered the Ultimate Poke Bowl which costs S$18++. As I'm looking for a light meal, the portion was just nice but if you're looking to fill your stomach you have to get a few sides! Very cool atmosphere as all furniture were to fit the Hawaiian theme

We went to their amoy branch. Not really happy with what we order. We ordered Roasted pork belly and lomi-lomi salmon. The roasted pork is really just 4 small slice of pork belly and 4 pineapple slice! Haha. And the lomi-lomi is bury-bury small portion small leaves, o wells. They say it supposed to be an appetizer. Thanks for the waitress who have unfriendly service never smiles when asked abt the juices or best sellers. If you want to spend 40++ for pints of servings, this is a place for you.

Simple and nice enough place , music a bit obnoxious, food simple and as expected . Tasty and it works. Service great and friendly. But cost of a simple beer is crazy either at the resto or Singapore!! Drinks are a rip off in Singapore sadl

Poke is one of those semi new fads in Singapore, like kale and quinoa it's popular amongst the healthy population and is a go to for someone like myself who doesn't really enjoy a conventional salad.Ordered the Aloha Wings which were on the smaller side when it comes to chicken wings but at 9 dollars can't really complain. Chicken was well seasoned, juicy and tasty. Also tried a pork wrap (Kalua Pig Burrito) which although tasty was simply not big enough for that price. At nearly 20 dollars you expect more than a teaspoon or two of meat, it was 75% lettuce

Ordered a standard salad bowl this Fri evening at the MBFC outlet and disappointed by tasteless chunks of original salmon and tuna fish. They were large and looked juicy but lacked taste.Leaves were fresh and size was filling. However, it was made worse by the mindless drizzle of soy sauce dispensed by staff. My lips were burning from over saltiness yuck.This place can't beat Rollie Olie's Poke Bowl and Teppei Syokudo's in terms of good tasting fish
3
Ordered the standard Aloha Poke mix. The fresh salmon is the one I immediately noticed. The rest of the ingredients are good quality as well. Not too crowded place since visited during the weekend.
3
Dinner with friends. Ideal for casual dining.
Small table seating. Tried their signature poke bowl good for sharing. Tried the wings too, highly recommended.
4
Good variety. There's rice and raw fish. Good size. Gets crowded at lunch time. Good alternative to smoke salmon for salads. Nice little outlet

I happened across this place a few months ago and have to admit I was not convinced, but I tried it and was completely blown away. I come here at least once a week and it has rapidly become one of my go to spots for an excellent lunch. Give it a try
3
Had the pokebowl and taste wise was 10/10However what i didn't like about it is that the portion was not as filling as i thought it would be and it doesn't have the option for me to choose my ingredients (or other rice options available)but would definitely go there again. (Prefer The Poke Theory across the street) th

The place felt it should be a happy place, liked the name and how it should greet customers... Aloha! Yes, the food was good and healthy. The 3 flavours were all good and was difficult to choose when you come the first time. The server was kind enough to have us taste each. If you don't want a spicy one, have the standard which has soy sauce and sesame taste, very Japanese. The wasabi mayo and the sriracha and chili were equally good and if you want that little kick, go for either or both. The extras were also good. Since we had several orders, had a chance to taste the almonds, edamame, carrots, cucumber and you can go with any. Suggest to have the avocado too Anyway, going back to the Aloha feeling and why this rating is only 3... we did not get that Aloha feeling. The servers were not rude but at the same time, did not seem very welcoming. I observed that for all the customers coming in, there were no welcome or greeting. No smiles in taking your orders. I think this place would be great if that changes and truly can give customers an "Aloha" feel

Hi,We ate with some friends at Aloha Poke last saturday evening. I chose the "Ultimate Poké bowl" "Tuna Spicy".At this time, it seemed quite OK but a few hours later my stomach ached so much (not because of spicy, I am used to and it was not really hot). My belly became so swollen.I suspect the tuna was not so fresh.This dinner was the only thing I ate in the evening so no doubt food poisoning came from here.I had to cancel all my plans for the sunday.For nearly $20 the salad, we could expect at least to have fresh fish

I will frequent this place almost once every fortnightly as I am so in love with the Poke. My partner on the other hand, loves their Loco Moco. We tried their Baked Whole Avocado during our last visit and it was good. They have happy hours in the evening. If the restaurant is packed, you will need a longer time for your food to arrive. Not recommended for groups as the restaurant is quite small and they only have high tables for 4.One thing they need to work on is the consistency of the food. The last time when my partner had the Loco Moco he was quite disappointed as the Beef Cheek was so tough

Tried the first Aloha Poke at Rollie Ollie, Pasar B at Suntec CityTried the second here.Prefer the sashimi portions here but did not care for the vinegared Brown Rice. A little more generous with superfood portions would be great.Friendly staff here compared to Ollie

This is a pretty niffty concept of wholesome food.After an incredible trip to Hawaii, two couples fell in love with the concept of the poké bowl, resulting in them being the first to bring the concept to Singapore. Aloha Poke is their creation, serving an innovative interpretation of the traditional Hawaiian Poké bowl.Poké bowls are a mixture of cooked and raw, hot and cold, both a comfort and health food. At Aloha Poké, the menu have a selection of Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Seasonal Fish and Tofu in a variety of eclectic flavours such as Wasabi Mayo, Spicy Sauce, Nutty Sesame and Original Sauce
4
Light and refreshing meal. It might be slightly on the pricier side but the portion is big. Please try their wasabi sashimi and brown rice. Will still recommend it to everyone.
4
Delicious, fresh and a lot was given. Though it is a little pricy but it is so worth it. queue can be better managed.
5
Amazing spicy tuna, salmon and garlic shrimp salad options with brown and/or white rice base topped with avocado and nuts...yum!

A poké bar in Singapore? A great idea. I've had poké overseas and thoroughly enjoyed the abundant vegetables, dressings and the generous serving of fresh and tasty salmon or tuna. Sadly, aloha poké misses the mark by a mile. Far too much plain lettuce (3/4 of the bowl), topped by two small scoops of fish, which was very tasty, but was really insufficient to justify the price, 2 small spoons of tomatoes and edamame, and a baby scoop of smashed avocado. A very disappointing lunch. See the photo next to my keyboard for scale, to see how mean the portion is. Shame. Could have been a great alternative. Instead, it's no more than an expensive, cheap copy

I'd heard a lot about this new craze over poke, so when we were in Singapore we had to check out Aloha and see what all the fuss was about. We were lucky as we arrived for a late-ish lunch on a weekday (around 1:30pm), so we didn't have to queue long or wait for a table. We really enjoyed the opportunity to customise our poke bowls, and had quite a bit of trouble deciding what we wanted. We all opted for the medium-sized bowl as we wanted to try two different proteins, and we were all very satisfied and full for the rest of the day! The ingredients were very fresh and with a great range to choose from. The fish was all very well seasoned and delicious - just the right balance of seasoning, without overpowering the taste of the fish itself. We have since tried another poke place back home, and we felt that the proportions of the ingredients at Aloha were spot-on. Very enjoyable, and definitely looking forward to trying it out again

This is a great place for a quick lunch. They have queue around the corner but you decide on what you want and write it down on a page before you get to the front. It helps the time go by quicker.The food is fantastic quality and has great flavour. A medium size (2 scoops) is SGD 16 but it's worth it for the quality
5
I never had poké before I came to this place. First time I tried, I LOVE THE HECK OUT OF IT! The simplest (it's raw) yet highly crafted (how they mix the tuna/salmon, vegs, fruits, nuts, beans and seasonings) healthy food that tastes awesome. Plus point for the refreshing Acai Bowl and my ever fave Brothers Apple Toffee Cider. I keep coming back

I have lunch/dinner at Aloha Poke about twice a week, always having the small bowl with spicy salmon, brown rice, edamame, cherry tomatoes and avocado. I am really not a fan of salad but this makes me eat my greens and come back for more!! The spicy salmon is full of flavour with a kick, you don't need the additional dressing. The ingredients are always fresh and full of flavour - hits the spot every time!! Also love the upbeat and quick service staff!!I tried A Poke Theory once and found that the spicy mayo salmon was really bland in comparison to Aloha Poke. I went for the lemon herb quinoa which was also poorly seasoned. You get 4 veggies with the small bowl - cherry tomatoes, edamame, cucumber and pineapple - but they aren't full of flavour like Aloha Poke. Left me very unsatisfied

Aloha Poke is a small place but it has character and very good sashimi style healthy salads. Some of the other dishes on the menu also sound interesting.I had the Poke bowl with wasabi tuna and salmon and it was fresh and tasty. I did not like the pineapple bits in it but that's my issue, I should have asked for them to be taken out. Service was ok, not bad, not great. Value for money wise it was also ok. One point to note is that there are at least 3-4 places in the same area that I tried and that have really good food and really good salads. For me Aloha Poke is a very good choice in regards to a sashimi style salad but when it comes to salads overall my preference is another place nearby that I reviewed previously

This place surprise me. It's situated along Club St. among all the more interesting eats and bars. Quite quiet on a weekend evening but not complaining since I want to enjoy my food and company peacefully / at least be able to hear each other The menu was a little limited but we manage to order a couple of things to shareI love this Poke bowl we ordered. You can actually choose your choice of flavour for your sashimi salmon. We went for wasabi and spicy and it turned out really interesting. I love bits of pineapple pieces in the Poke bowl to bring out refreshing tasteWe also ordered this grilled avocado with cheese and tiny pieces of Parma ham. It was sooooo good!! I absolutely love the combination of cheese with nicely grilled Avo halves!Lastly for dessert, we ordered an Açaí bowl and I love the density and richness of Açaí flavou

What a lunch!!! So tasty and filling yet light and healthy! I wish we had this back home. Great place, in a great area! Highly highly recommend this!

its one of the places that is always crowded during lunch. great salmon/tuna salad as its healthy and full of protein. they have few level of the spiciness , i particularly like the wasabi salmon .
3
Finally a place in CBD which provide nice poke bowls on the go! The salmon was fresh and cool on the tongue, topped with little bits of tobiko, shredded carrots and premium healthy ingredients such as the chia seeds, kale and avocado!It was 'super food' which I wished could be a little bit more

Visit Aloha Poke at lunch time.First you need to fill up order sheet.You can choose contents one by one also you can choose set bowl from Tuna or Salmon.Salad is very fresh and many things inside bowl.Volume is enough for light lunch.If you like salad shop like salad stop then you like this
4
So this is my first time having poke and I guess it's best described as Hawaiian chirashi? Or really, just a glorified raw fish salad/ rice bowl? The flavors are light and refreshing but the servings here a little small. I had to go get something else to eat after lunch. For the ingredients served and freshness, I guess prices are reasonable. Maybe next time I'll order the bigger portion
5
Came here in the evening with friends. Some really strong and Creative cocktails! Place had a nicebuzz to it, mostly people from the finance industry getting a drink after work. Staff seemed earnest and polite. Didn't try the poke bowls but I've been told they are great.
4
Just read a recommendation about the place today and went there spontaneously. the service was good but prices were a bit on the more expensive side for takeaway. The interior was nice, overall nice, will go there again. The food was really tasty, fresh and healthy, enjoyed it

Chanced upon this quiet bar at Amoy street after some korean BBQ session and decided to pop in for some drinks. UOB card members enjoy 1-for-1 cocktails at $18nett.Pretty interesting concept of the display of cocktails in Aloha tribute mug. We ordered the Fiery Passion and the Mauna Loa

First time trying poke and I don't understand the hype. I might sound a bit disrespectful but isn't it just some salad with raw fish? The tuna was a bit too salty but that is personal preference. We expected the taste to be a little bit more tropical.Nevertheless it perfect for a quick super healthy lunch and you can have some Hawaiian beer with it. But don't expect something exceptional new.Btw chopsticks are not provided so don't think it is a whole year CNY salad tossing ;-)

Being from Hawaii, I was curious to see how the poke at Singapore's first poke restaurant compared to the poke bowls back home. Aloha Poke gives you the option of customizing your poke bowls with various flavors, ingredients, and superfoods. Take note that the dinner poke bowls come at a set price and are already included with a number of add-ons plus one superfood. My spicy ahi/wasabi ahi poke bowl tasted more like a refreshing health salad, which is what I believe this restaurant is aiming for. Poke purists might argue that the added ingredients detract from the flavor of the marinated fish, and I do agree that the overall taste of their poke bowls differ from those commonly seen in Hawaii. Having said that, the combination of salad leaves, healthy add-ons, chia seeds, rice, and raw fish blended together quite nicely and made for a tasty snack. We also ordered the spam musubi appetizer. It consisted of one slice of spam, caramelized, and divided into 6 pieces of mini nigiri-style sushi. It was a bit sweet for my taste but passable - it's really hard to go wrong with spam musubi. Definitely not worth paying $11 for though
