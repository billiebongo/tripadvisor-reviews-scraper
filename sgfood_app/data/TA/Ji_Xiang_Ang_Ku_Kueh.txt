One reason to visit - the 'ang ku kuehs' - turtle pies made or rice dough. They're pretty cheap and you might think 'oh, let's just take a couple of each kind' - not a good idea, really. They are very, very filling. You eat two and you start considering skipping the lunch. I can't recommend any type over the others, though the red bean paste is the must, of course
