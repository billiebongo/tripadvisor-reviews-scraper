The food was very good - most dishes were great and some were a total miss. Good wine list as well. Would visit again.

This was a case of splendid internet presence not being met by anything out of the ordinary when it came to food..Overpromising and underdelivering is dangerous...

Would only go back for their lamb tacos. Other dishes including dessert were just about average and nothing special for the inflated prices.

This is not your run of the mill Indian. A very modern take on classical Indian, which manages to maintain the essence if Indian food. Excellent vegetarian, absolutely stunning curries and assorted Indian breads to die for. Wish I could go back!

One of the best Indian food I have had in a Long time. A quiet little restaurant that serves simple & amazing food. If you love Indian food you must visit this place..

Excellent dining experience. If not THE best, one of the best Indian fusion cuisines in town. Each and every item we ordered was outstanding (we ordered vegetarian food). Simple, but mindbogglingly delicious. Hospitality was amazing. Ambiance was also good. It can compete with Micheline Star Indian restaurants with a reasonable price tag as the cherry on top

Had been to this place for a business dinner. It was an outstanding fine dine experience, great food, good ambience and music, good service. Pricing wise I found it to be a lil on the higher side. Their Biryani was class apart. They served a mouth refreshing ice candy which was simply outstanding. Their food mainly has some or the other fusion in taste, yet maintaining the original taste of the dish.I recommend this place for a fine dine experience.

Had been recommended for a signature meal! The decor is quite nice and the whole set up quite upmarket.The dishes were nice and authentic though a wee bit bland. But the food was delicious. Surprisingly the place was quite noisy, not sure if this was particular to the evening as there was a large group eating together

The most outstanding service I have seen in any restaurant in Singapore! Friendly, knowledgeable. Typical Indian hospitality with every dish served in small bowls and bought to your table!! Just par excellence. They've set the bar too high for anyone to compete now! The menu is not ostentatious, it is simple yet exotic! Very unique Flavours and combinations!We ordered almost everything vegetarian on the menu. And I couldn't not fault a single dish !Highly recommend the breads, the crispiest I have ever had! The best multigrain paratha. The veg kebab platter was interesting. The broccoli kofta and the dhal and the kadhai paneer were all outstanding. The okra raita is a must do! The aubergine in a glass jar with hung yoghurt was also nice.The price per head worked out to about $50-$60 without any drinks on the table.They have a lovely tasting and set lunch menu which we couldn't try. Must make a reservation to avoid disappointment.

I was told that this was Singapore's top Indian restaurant. The location and cadre are excellent. However, the "fusion" food served in minuscule quantities had no defined taste and no amount of " window dressing" will make me change my opinion. The prices were inversely proportionate to the food servings

Went with family to celebrate a couple of birthdays. While on the expensive side, its totally worth it. The ambience, the food, the creativity, the service, all very memorable. More power to you, team Saha.

Super food. went on a quiet Saturday. easily got a reservation, great service, good explanation of what is what, and amazing repertoire of food. Indian but fusion. A lot of east meets south ( Bengali/ Kerala) combination

We had a lovely evening at Saha tonight. The setting was beautiful and the meals were delicious. I also must add that the service was excellent, we have found some mid to high range restaurants in Singapore do vary when it comes to quality of the dishes and the service however we could not fault Saha whatsoever. I had a cauliflower entree which exceeded my expectations and a barramundi curry which was very good, my husband had a prawn curry which was also extremely tasty. I was also impressed with the Indian wine. Yes it will cost more than the more basic Indian restaurants but if you are after some finer Indian food, I would definitely recommend this restaurant

The hotel we were staying at in Singapore highly recommended Saha as one of the new and upcoming Indian restaurants in the city. A caveat I should state here is that I am vegetarian and 'am writing this review from that perspective. We were shown promptly to our table and the staff were accommodating in allowing us to choose a table of our choice. Menus were brought swiftly to the table and we were asked if we wanted water. No one asked us about drinks. Water was poured and we were asked for our menu choices. We had barely 90 secs to look over the menu. I asked for more time and chose a few starters and main courses. I ordered a paneer galouti starter that was brought to our table stone cold. We ordered the tandoori baked cauliflower and it sounded very interesting given it was marinated with peanut butter sauce. The cauliflower arrived cooked but the sauce tasted raw and had an overpowering flavour of crushed coriander seeds. Clearly an effort gone awry. The mains were OK and so were the breads. The raita was a dismal failure as the yogurt was way too sour and the chef had added loads of salt to overcome the sour taste. It was inedible to put it mildly !! We were then very oddly asked if we wanted the cheque or desert. We opted for the desert and I did ask for the cheque too. The bill arrived was paid for and our desert hadn't yet arrived. The manager very patiently listened to our feedback and said he'd pass it onto the kitchen. Hopefully it is of some help.....however I won't be coming back here neither recommending it to anyone I know

Visited with family including elders and children for lunch. We were 5 of us.We ordered two set bengal meals and rest a la carte .We were not disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed the lovely meals. Since it was lunch time we gave the wine a miss.The desserts were to die for. The gulab jamun cheesecake was a absolute wonder!Well worth the price

A visit to Saha was long overdue and we combined it finally with a visit to the national Gallery. The restaurant is well decorated and not typically Indian in its dÃ©cor. They also have the facility of a private room for intimate gatherings or meetings.Another advantage is that it is wheel chair accessible. They have a fair amount of vegetarian dishes and the biggest plus point was the willingness of the staff to add or change items. We ordered a veg platter and my husband was not keen on mushrooms the person on duty on overhearing our conversation quickly offered to replce them with veg samosas much to our delight. Service was great. My only gripe was that there was no table cloth on the table and new plates and cutlery was put on the crumbs of the previous course. Great food, central location, beautuiful ambience and amazing staff this restaurant has a lot going for it

I always wanted to try Saha when they were at Duxton Hill so when it came time for a birthday dinner we knew exactly where to go. From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated so incredibly well. The staff is wonderful very attentive without being obtrusive. They are very friendly and quite knowledgeable. The decor is very tastefully done and that's just when you sit down. The food is amazing!!!! Even the Indian cocktails are wonderful. They started with some lovely finger sized Poppadoms with two sauces which were both lovely. Then there was a popsicle palate cleanser. It was such a unique way to serve it and so refreshing and fun. If you like Parmesan cheese and olives, then you have to try the Naan. What a unique and wonderful flavour. The chicken curry was to die for. The Raika with Pomegranate was great and every now and again you got those little bursts of flavour. Even the onion and mint rice (I know sounds odd but boy is it good) was wonderful. Since it was a birthday dinner, we also had a lovely cheesecake for dessert. It was also good value for money. It's lovely for a night out and also for special occasions. They also have a separate room if you need some place for a larger group. It was such a lovely evening and I highly recommend it. As one other reviewer said, this is definitely a 5-star night out!!! I will definitely return. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did

Dropped in to ' Saha ' at NAGA for an unplanned dinner . It's so nice , I think I'll be back there soon.Menu was more new age rather than traditional , but there were enough classic offerings to sate well .The naans & dhal were excellent , and the onion + mint pulao was outta this world !Lip - smacking

This place is one of its kind in Singapore for those foodies who like indian fusion and also for those who like Indian food. This place completely blew off my mind in terms of its decor, look and the food as it is different from what is usually served in Indian restaurants. I also ordered for starters, drinks and desserts which were also very good. There is variety of choices in the menu. This is one of the best places I have been in Singapore. Its location is also really good as its located in the heart of the National Gallery. I would like to make frequent visits to this place.

There are several Indian fine dining restaurants in Singapore, such as Song of India (terrible) and Rang Mahal (excellent). Thankfully, Saha falls into the latter category. Staff here are exemplary- polite, unobtrusive and knowledgeable. Food is also exquisite. The fish curry of the week was outstanding. Another very good dish was the dahl, cooked using dark colored lentils. And the tandoor meats were tender, moist and succulent. Add to that a classy ambience and you've got yourself a 5-star Saturday night out.
