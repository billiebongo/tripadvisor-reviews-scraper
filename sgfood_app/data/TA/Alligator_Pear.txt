A lovely place to have breakfast, especially when preceded by a swim in the pool! Thoroughly recommended.

Lovely to sit and eat breakfast by the pool at the Fairmont Hotel. This was included in our room rate but nonetheless it was enjoyable.
5
Our family really enjoyed eating here. There was a great variety for breakfast which provided various options for our children and ourselves. The pool is great and was so nice and relaxing eating by it.

In a place full of amazing restaurants and food offerings this one isn't as good as some, but anywhere else it would be pretty good!Easy for a quick bite by the poolside but expensive for what it is.*Great drinks, cocktails, mocktails, milkshakes and juice

This pool bar with food offers you a range of cocktails, light meals and main courses for you to have whilst at the pool. The service is great and the menu although not big does offer everyone a good lunch whether you are a guest or not. The bar has stools where you can drink cocktails till late and you can enjoy the evening looking over the marina bay hotel who has a light show at 8pm ever night.

The Alligator Pear cafe by the main pool of the Fairmont hotel is a traveller's delight. Great coffee and also fruit juices designed to deal with jet lag. The menu includes fresh and interesting salads as well as the traditional poolside burgers. Fresh and tasty salads are so difficult to find when travelling. Service is outstanding. I arrived jet lagged this morning seeking lunch before the cafe reopened after breakfast. Staff offered me the choice of ordering from a room service menu with the food to be delivered poolside or a coffee and juice while I waited half an hour for the cafe/restaurant to open. I always visit this cafe when at the Fairmont. As a solo traveller I also appreciate the staff's knowledge of when to chat and when to leave a customer alone with his/her iPad. Highly recommended

Our family of 7 had a lovely dinner by the pool on New Year's Eve. It was a wonderful night eating outdoor and we were able to watch most of the fireworks from Marina Bay Sands just from where we were.It was such a lovely spot and a gem find to watch the fireworks without pushing through beating the crowds at the Marina. The dinner was buffet style and although the variation was basic, the meat and prawns were cooked to perfection. We were very impressed and satisfied with the food for the amount of meat/seafood that was put out. The buffet dinner was great value for money in comparison to other dinner package for NYE in Singapore. There was free flowing wine, beers and soft drinks and the wait staff were so accommodating, coming by every few minutes to constantly top up our drinks. The staff at the hotel were very professional and friendly, going out of their way to assist us with all our requests. Thank you for a lovely night out

Just came back after a scrumptious breakfast at this lovely restaurant.Though there wasnt anything outstanding about the food, we had a lovely time thanks to the great ambience and an ever obliging staff who were willing to go the extra mile witha smile.The food was also good if not outstanding. Would definitely go there again
5
Wonderful staff and great place. Awesome experience. The view is fantastic and the staff were treating everyone with great smile and service. Will like to come back often.

If you are staying at the Fairmont, Singapore this is the ideal spot for a very pleasant breakfast. Ideal location by the pool, staff very obliging and food first class . One staff member, Msagy is a treasure.
5
We absolutely love this place. Great chill out place on a lazy afternoon by the pool. Great service. Meet a friend Msagy whom we've known for some years. Always wonderful having her to take care of us.

Ate breakfast here while staying at the Fairmont
Food is excellent, in quality and variety.
Nice city scape and pool out look.

Healthy and simple selection for breakfast. So pleasant to swim, have breakfast, then relax by the pool again!
5
Outdoor by the Pool - good Breakfast over here. Two hotel combine large pool. Dislike - to many kids on weekend.

We had lunch here whilst staying at the Fairmont Singapore. Service was very pleasant in a relaxed atmosphere by the poolside and the food was good quality. Two courses and a drink for two was SG$93 (approx £45).

This is the bar and eatery at the Fairmont hotel.We ate here for breakfast but I just wanted to say the bar is a lovely place to start your evening.As the sun starts to go down its lovely and warm as you sit round the bar with views over towards the Marina Bay Sands.The pools are relaxed and a few people still loiter on the sun beds enjoying the atmosphere.Best time to go from around 1730 to 1800, happy hour means the beers and pina coladas are cheaper, watch out for the free wasabi nuts though, they're spicy and yum.Staff as always at the Fairmont are fantastic

Located on the 8th floor of the Fairmont Hotel, the breakfast here may not have the variety and wide range of food available at Prego, but it's a great location especially on a cool breezy day. They have 8 choices of juices, as well as pastries like croissants, muffins and buns. Eggs can also be ordered from the cook at the small window. Other breakfast items include sausages, bacon, potatoes, and some local delicacies like char siew pau or fried noodles.Service is always with a smile, and staff are always ready to lend a hand in getting an extra pot of coffee etc
3
Yes it's beside the pool between Swissotel and Fairmont, but $37.00 for 2 lattes, sm water and a brownie in my opinion was very overpriced. On the other hand the service we received was quick. I doubt we would go back.
4
I think this is a great location for early breakfast especially if your staying at the Fairmont Hotel.. Not the largest of buffet spreads, but adequate and plenty of choise to start the day. Coffee is also great.
3
Food was good, though menu was limited. Likely because it serves at the poolside, though I have seen better menus at other hotel pools. Service was fine. Friendly. The finger foods were pretty tasty. Overall a generally pleasant experience.
4
Great location on level 8 of the Fairmont overlooking the roof top pools, nice cooling breeze, but quite a lot for a simple continental breakfast - $50 ie £25.
4
Not to heavy a meal, excellent service. The burger meal was excellent - best I have had. The staff come round with tasting of drinks. Plenty of water offered. Great to sit by the pool and relax while having a meal.
5
great venue outdoors. we spent time there for both breakfast and lunch, as well as a relaxing drink while the kids had a dip in the water. Friendly staff, reasonable prices and an excellent way to find time to relax between shopping and sightseeing.
3
It was standard buffet fare and a bit pricey. Why do it when you can go 2 blocks away to enjoy a local Chinese breakfast or go to Arab town (try Zam Zam Restaurant) and try something you never imagined.
4
We had a lazy morning by the pool whilst staying at the Swissotel Stamford and decided to have lunch there. The variety is what you would expect from an international hotel and we all received something we liked â€“ and the quality was good. I had a Thai beef salad and others had a burger and nachos.

This is the poolside restaurant of the Fairmont Hotel and Swissotel Stamford. It's a really lovely atmosphere and especially good for breakfast. A really good egg station. If you're not sure what that is, you must try it! The chef is on standby to prepare your eggs anyway you'd like including amazing cooked-to-order omelettes, pancakes and regular eggs. I also had lunch by the pool. The seafood pad Thai noodles were tasty, light and served well. However, I would have liked access to some condiments. Service is great and the drinks at the poolside bar are well prepared! Also, you are served little mini juice drinks and fruit skewers by the pool which is great in the heat of the day

It was quite refreshing to have breakfast by the poolside, helped by the good weather. The food was only decent in terms of quality and variety. It was the standard international buffet breakfast spread, with fruits, yogurt, sausages, bacon, ham, local foods like nasi lemak and fried bee hoon, and an egg station. There was a good spread of breads too - and a good spread of birds helping themselves to the bread too. There wasn't enough staff to shoo the birds away, so naturally we gave all the breads a miss. It was a very big turn-off
5
What do you want when you have walked all day sight seeing, a long/tall cool drink and or perhaps a cool dip in the pool, the Alligator Pear bar has it all. Wonderful service, helpful and friendly staff. A great place to unwind and relax.
5
We thorouly enjoyed our breakfasts at Aligator Pear. Lovley staff great selection and good coffee to get you going.
4
Good range of fresh food, sitting beside the pool, with attentive staff. Nice to be outside but cool.
4

We recently stayed at the Stamford and ate at the Alligator Pear every morning for breakfast...the food is really fresh...fruit is fabulous...lots of juices...hot asian food, breads, croissants, pastries..you can also get an omelette made for you....only slight problem were the number of birds waiting to pounce...so if you are eating alone, make sure you cover all your food if you get up from your table...because if you dont.....welll you can guess what happens !staff are lovely and friendl
2
The outdoor seating area is lovely - right by the pool. The food is also very good... however, the hotel/restaurant always has a bird problem. The birds loiter around the restaurant - pinching left over scraps from diner's plates and often found eating at the cakes/breads in buffet area of the restaurant when not occupied!!! Not very hygienic at all

This place is basically the pool bar/restaurant for the Swissotel/Fairmont hotels and offers a great buffet breakfast however lunch here is average, and of mixed quality depending what you have. Its standard hotel room service style food (club sandwiches, omlettes, etc) and over around 8 meals we had there they were each of different quality ranging from poor to just OK. Convenient place to eat if at the pool, but wouldn't make the trip here if wasn't staying at the hotel.

The Alligator Pear is the great hospitality area between the Fairmont Hotel and the Swissotel The Stamford. If you are a guest at either of these hotels you can rely on first class food and service when you go for a swim. Happy Hour on beer and selected cocktails between 12-4 daily. Make sure you try a Mojito. It's a beautiful cocktail with lime, fresh mint and Bacardi. :-
