Tellingly this place is full every night with locals as well as tourists unlike places next door. Really good local food - more meat than hawker market fare.

Authentic Chinese food with great local atmosphere. We went on a Sunday evening and the place was buzzing. Fast and friendly service. Minimum charge SGD.9 per head so not expensive. Everything we ate was fresh, delicious and served hot. Beer was cold!

This place is just wonderful. The food is very authentic, tastes great, huge portions and dirt cheap. I've eaten in a lot of places in Singapore, but this is one place I always go back to. Even my ultra fussy son was happy to eat here, again and again.It is noisy, it is busy, it is crammed, it is hot (well, it is Singapore), so if you want somewhere to eat with nice cool a/c blowing out, this is not the place for you

We were lucky to randomly have found this place after massage nearby. This place is easy to find, because it faces a big road and is packed with customers. The service is not great but they have various menu, the food is good, and the price is reasonable, rather cheap considering Singapore

Love this restaurant. It was packed with locals. Even so, service was fast, food was fresh and hot. Value was great! Would highly recommend a visit here. We tried the stir fried green beans with garlic and red peppers. I have no idea what they were called on the menu. Sweet and sour fish, fried rice, and sweet corn on the cob. Every dish was great and full of flavor.

I know it's almost Chinese New Year but this place was packed out busy for lunch! I got the last single table available. Quite an extensive menu of options both meat and veggie. The prices are far better than the vast majority of restaurants around the city. I ordered the Pork Dim Sum and the Chicken noodles. Food came out VERY fast even though the waitress said that the dim sum takes 20 min's...(Probably got my food in 10 min's). The dim sums were delish--steaming hot and juicy. Comes 6 in an order. The Chicken noodles were good, huge portion...good for sharing not for 1 person. The only thing I'd say is there was hardly any chicken in the dish....so that was disappointing. Otherwise this is a very popular place, loud, fast paced, large portions, good price and decent food! Go with a group

We ordered an eggplant dish and it was really delicious. We ordered a few other dishes which were lovely to eat. But the fried pork fish recommended by the staff was disappointing. It was overcooked and even hard to chew. Overall, it was a lovely dinner and we will definitely go there again!

on the paper, it looks pretty interesting. The menu is quite large, covering many aspects of Chinese cuisine, and skewers. Price wise, it is on the cheap side particularly compared to the places around.now, being particularly biased towards spicy food, i went once and was left short on my expectation. decided still to return for wider choice, in case i was unlucky.unfortunately no. I have not found the original taste, the whole lot being a far cry from any kind of numbing Sichuan pepper for example. so... i did not pay a lot, maybe someone who looks for tuned down food to "tourist level", pretty good. yet, not original.cannot complain on service or general setup considering the pricing level

This place is so good I went here twice during my short stay in Singapore. You just know it will be good when it is always busy and rammed with locals. Nothing fancy here. Just good food, large portion sizes and reasonable prices. I ordered the mushroom dish and the bitter melon with egg dish. The egg was lightly too salty for me and the bitter melon a tad over cooked. Other than that, a very good meal. It is about $8 a dish here. For one person, you only need one dish with a side of rice. By the way, only use the wet towel if you need it, otherwise that is added onto the bill. They don’t tell you this and it’s not clear. With the towels on the table, you would just assume it was free.

Most of the comments here are helpful. We went and really enjoyed it. It was very busy so we sat outside. Service was fast and friendly. Food taste was close to real Sichuan food. Although it was cheap bite, our dishes were well cooked and we didn't have any problems after the meal. Highly recommended

Food is excellent and reasonable price. Portions are large too. Very easy to order take away. Which is perfect after a long flight. Then go veg out in Hotel and relax!

4 people and the total bill is only 60-70 SGD. My mom is a cook but she praise the cold dishes too (especially love the cold pork with chilli and cucumber).
5
If you're after good, tasty quick, cheap food this is definitely one to head for... All dishes we ordered were excellent.
5
It is incredibly cheap and still very tasty! The portions are large and the service is also good. Very tasty vegetables and excellent rice! Here you get very good food at EVERY TIME. They always opened!

Have come for dinner and lunch at least 5 times. Each time the food is good and cheap. Portions are generous and the food is served very promptly. In fact, everything here is done fast and efficiently. The waitresses would find you a seat almost immediately or direct you to line up at the queue. The queue can be quite long if you arrive past 7 pm dinner time. At lunch time, there is hardly a queue but the restaurant is never quiet. There is always a steady flow of customers.The waitresses can be quite rude or impatient as they are very busy. No time to recommend dishes slowly. One waitress was flipping the pages of the menu so fast and roughly just to get us to order quickly and move on.Best dish here is the appetiser that looks like kuay teow in spicy sauce with cucumber shreds and pork called the La Pi. Only dish i didn't like was the spicy chicken with mala sauce and ramen. Too salty and too much noodles.Anyways, this place never fails to satisfy. Will return

They have a lot of dish options, so ordering can be difficult, as you don't know where to stop. Must try - various Barbq sticks, Onion pancake, Straw mushroom salad. They have a variety of Chinese beer as well, to wash down the spice. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available, and the place can get full, but they rotate the tables quiet fast. Must visit if you are in the Chinatown are

We went to Chinatown in Singapore and decided to stop here for a late lunch. There was a lineup, but we were seated after waiting about 10 minutes. The menu has lots of variety to choose from, including pics of the dishes. Everything we ordered was delicious and flavorful

If you are after a great northern china meal , this place is hard to beat. Sure you are packed in , and it's loud , but we find that's not a problem because of the food is fantastic. The serves are huge for Singapore and the quality is always great. The menu is huge , you can eat there many times and never order the same dishes. I love the Twice Cooked Pork, it is unusual and spectacular....a little like sweet and sour pork , but way better . This is our go to place when we have friends visiting , to give a taste and feel of the real Asian style of eating out. If you are going to be in Singapore it is a must, and with it being at Chinatown makes it even more of a great location to visit

I just love it and I love how successful they are which shows by their constant expansion. They deserve it. Originally just a one windows shop they now wrap around the corner of the street. We initially only stopped there because the smoke of their grill was so intensively thick that I just had to take a photo and then decided to give their SatÃ©s a try. Fabulous. After so many Tigers and eating more than half of their menu I still love to sit outside (!) and enjoy the food and athmo in company. Yes, you sit on plastic chairs. Yes, you might have to wait to be seated. Yes, their radioeing and iPad ordering system is, oh well. Yes, English is not the language of choice.Yes, their food is absolutely delicious, quick and more than affordable. And one Caveat: If a plate seems quite expensive than it's thought to be shared. And: You don't need to bring paper napkins. Quite a treat in SIN

we went for supper,need to wait for table by standing outside.a lot of china style food with reasonable price,but their services is too bad! when we are still eating and our table still leave 3-4 dish , a waiter ask us for bill and try to give other customers our seat.it is too terrible

If you are after some amazing late night grub after hittin the bars this is you place. It is open late, it is loud, it is full of people, and it is delicious. Love it and visit every time I am in town.

Hard to know what to choose from the huge menu (with pictures!). I chose 3 dishes and this was way more than I could eat; all that and a large beer came to $30.
Best dish was a starter - tofu topped with preserved eggs

If you want late night grub in Chinatown where it's just fast, greasy, yet delicious eats, this is the place. My non-Chinese friends told me that this is their go-to place for meat skewers, delicious some-what spicy vegetables and interesting dishes that they find good to eat. I have to agree with them - the prices were super affordable, ranging from $1.50 to $3 per pair of skewers, to $8 plates of large plate vegetables to be shared among multiple people. We celebrated Boxing Day eating our way through $14.50 of unassuming Sichuan-style eats

When in Singapore we visited the Chinatown area and were after a quick and easy meal in a location close to the MRT. After a stroll around we across this place and it was packed with locals and some visitors. After a table came free we jumped in and ordered abou some visitors. After a table came free we jumped in and ordered about 4 dishes that arrived swiftly to our table. The food was delicious and was very well priced for what was on offer. We even went back for a second visit a few nights later for another meal we were so happy with the place. would visit here again - cheap eats that was fresh and tasty
5
We were staying in the hotel nearby I chose this restaurant to grab take-away based on how full it was compared to other places around. The food here is excellent with fresh ingredients and authentic taste. The prices here are very reasonable compared to the overall Singapore level. Strongly recommended for eat-in or take-aways

We stopped for lunch at this restaurant because we saw it was full with Chinese diners, so it can't be bad, and we were certainly not disappointed . The place is simple tables and chairs no special decorations or haute decor.We ordered sweet and sour pork, which was good but a bit too sweet, garlic broccoli which was excellent, noodles with vegetables and mushrooms which was excellent and mutton with onions and red chilies which was spicy and good.Downed with a cold Harbin beer great lunc

We were walking around when we saw this packed place (of locals, no tourists, always a good sign) and wanted to give it a try. Best decision! I can't remember the names of the dishes, only thing I can say is they all were very tasty and in general delicious! Fully recommende

This was an lucky find as we just happened across it as we were looking for the heart of Chinatown. The staff appear to have limited English and the whole operation is orchestrated by the matriarch who stands at the back of the restaurant calling all the shots and collecting the money. The food is excellent and will have your mouth watering for more. Thankfully they have Chinese beers to wash it all down aswell

In a crowded (always a good sign) restaurant you sit cheek by jowl with your neighbour and point to dishes in the menu with pictures. Portions are a good size - so one main course between two is fine, two would be a feast - the food delicious and prices very reasonable. The Harbin beer very drinkable too. Every time I go to Singapore I try to make sure to visit - the Chicken with Chili a favourite - tasty but not too spicy. Portions are large and prices low compared to the slightly more touristy restaurants on nearby Smith Street - this one is worth the 50 yard detour

Don't let looks deceive you. This restaurant is brightly light with strip lights and has plastic furniture. The restaurant is crowded and noisy with the hustle and bustle of diners. Some of the tables are outside, so you can watch the world go by. It is not the most inviting of places to each. What is important is that the locals eat here. You are met by the hostess, quite a character. She barks orders at the staff at the rear of the restaurant to get you a table at the top of her voice! Quite entertaining really. The menu is in in Chinese and English, with pictures of each dish. This makes selection so much easier. The food does not always arrive together or in the right order. It really does not matter! Portions are large. With fantastic flavours. A great selection of dishes to suit all tastes. I try to choose some different every time I go. Excellent value for money.I have eaten here at least a dozen times. I love it! I always take my friends and relatives to eat here! I will be back on my next trip to Singapore
