Set lunch really good and value for money.
Their mushroom soup, burger (main course) and dessert of the day is nicely presented and taste nice. I also like their tea (from tea forte).
Staff quite attentive and know the menu well (can give some recomendation).

Fast and efficient. Easy going staffs.There are some flexibility and our pet dog is allowed . Thus, suffice to say that there is so humane and non bias restaurant. Children has thier own menu too.

The small plates are an excellent way of trying a few different dishes. It was nice to have a beer that wasn't the standard 3 available in Singapore.

Singapore has no shortage of brunch places, but this one has shot to the top of our list. With the quality sliding at our old favourite, Wild Honey, we were on the lookout for somewhere with great brunch options and cracking coffee. Blackbird puts big ticks in both those boxes. I had the big brekkie - a marvellous and well presented full English, and was particularly struck by the quality of ingredients used. Well worth a visit

I was here with a friend for lunch after our movie at The Cathay. Nice cosy place with a well stocked bar. Very friendly wait staff and big drinks list. Prices for drinks are normal by Singapore standards (Singapore has obscenely priced alcoholic beverages anyway).The food, however was disappointing. Prices for the food are relatively low and after tasting them, I figured out why. Cheap, low quality produce. I think the only good item on the menu would be the fried chicken wings. We had quite a few things- the lamb pasta, burger, rib eye and a few bar snacks. Though each dish was cooked well, the quality of the produce and flavour profiles were highly disappointing. The steak tasted like it was frozen, the lamb pasta was too sweet and had a strong game flavour, the burger was dry and the bar snacks were too small a portion. I would only recommend this place for pre lunch/dinner drinks. And the chicken wings to snack on. Nothing more.

We walked in off the street to this restaurant/bar and were so surprised at the quality of the food and service, it's a trendy kind of place (me being 50 ) but they they so nice and helpful. When we had finished up and paid our bill we sat outside so I could smoke and the waiter came out to us with a glass of the wine we had been drinking with our meal on the house which was a very nice touch.

After a full day in Singapore, we needed food! A walk took us from Bencoolen Road to Blackbird Café. It looked interesting from the outside, but the inside took on a whole new, delightful vibe. Beer was fairly priced and ice-cold. A fairly extensive menu with reasonable prices, by Singapore standards, and we selected the lasagne and a chicken salad. Both were excellent.Indeed, the second visit the following evening was even better; fish 'n chips and risotto with seafood, plus the obligatory ice-cold beer, and we felt well fed.Thoroughly recommend Blackbird Café. There are a few televisions catering for the sports-lovers, although it seemed only soccer was available. Folk at the next table even had their well-behaved dog with them. Certainly no objections.The welcome and the service by the staff was first class and the overall ambience is top-whack. There are even magazines for those folk alone or bored with their companion

We became regulars at this place after we first discovered it by accident. It has really nice decoration, and some tables to sit outside (very rare these days in Orchard area).They have a nice selection of wines and beers, and even a lot of whiskeys. If you come more often, buy the whiskey per bottle... much cheaper! They will keep it for you until you visit again.The staff is vert friendly and observant. The food is plain excellent for the prices charged! Really good quality, served in a original presentation. I recommend to check out their small bites on the last page of the menu, which even includes some pizzas. We have tried many things there, did not try everything yet but have never been disappointed.Must go

Came here after work on a Friday night - had a Truffle Fries ($12), and a Jay's Risotto ($18).Truffle fries was ordered as a starters, and came after a 15-20 minute wait. There were 2 risottos on the menu - a Seafood Risotto and "Jay's Risotto) - which really was just a mushroom risotto.So when I tried to order the Jay's Risotto, the server did not understand what I was trying to say. So I tried to explain that I wanted the "Non-seafood risotto" - to which the server still had no idea what I was trying to order. Then I said I wanted the risotto which had the mushroom in it - yet it did not ring a bell with the server. So I had to resort to opening up the menu and pointing to the item in the menu - THAT DID THE TRICK! WOW!The risotto rice had a flour-ey texture - not really sure that was really a risotto I had, or if it was overcooked and the rice grains were falling apart or something. The texture of freshly-used grains was just was not there.Then I had a Whitebait ($10) which was just deep-fried whitebait fish, with the tail and all. Quite crispy and decent especially when paired with a beer. This was followed by a Tangy Corn Chips ($8) which was just really a pathetic serving of corn chips with guacamole and salsa sauce - obviously the dippings were too much in proportion to the chips.For drinks I had a Crabbies Ginger Beer ($15) - the server brought two bottles of Crabbies beer - the ginger flavour and another fruit flavour. I was puzzled and thought it was some 1-for-1 deal - I was so wrong. It was a wrong order made and I had the server return it.Then I ordered a Laphroaig Quarter Cask ($20). Server asked me how I wanted it and I said "Neat". The server stared at me blankly and I said "NEAT". Server asked me if I wanted it "On the rocks". I said "No - I want it neat, without ice and all". So the server then brings me a neat shot, IN A CHILLED GLASS.For Pete's sake, if I wanted it neat and chilled, I would've asked for it on the rocks! When someone orders a "NEAT" shot of a whisky - GIVE IT TO THE GUY IN A ROOM-TEMPERATURE GLASS!Won't be returning to this place again - servers are untrained and unfamiliar with the menu items. Atmosphere is rowdy and you can't even hear yourself most of the time.Servers got our order wrong twice and we had to ask them to come and take it back... quite appalling indeed

I came here for brunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends. We got here just before 10am which was advertised as the opening time but found they had opened slightly earlier which was a nice surprise. The food was great! The crepes seemed somewhat small but everything else was quite large in portion size. Very tasty with good prices, especially for CBD Singapore. Would certainly go back!

Thanks Denise for her extra effort for serving us dinner despite last order and Mustaffa who is really kind to explain culture. Good service these days at such joint is not easy to come by. Decent good food and good value:) thanks guys!

Good food served during happy hour which meant that drinks were half price before 8pm. The cafe is situated just off Orchard Road and is perfect for a lunch time/evening meal. We paid £50 for a meal for 3 with drinks.

one of the most underrated cafes in Singapore. The food is quality and the coffee and cocktails are good.

Happened to chance upon this little cafe tucked away in a corner of Dhoby Ghaut - a gem of a find! Special shoutout to the great staff; each one of them was attentive, friendly and prompt. Food measured up to expectations as well, served fresh and hot. Highly recommend Blackbird Cafe to those looking to wind down and catch up with friends/family over drinks and good food

My husband and I have lived in Singapore for over 2 years now and we return to Blackbird time after time. It is by far the best value we have found for western food in Singapore, with excellent quality and fantastic staff.This is a hidden gem! Anywhere else of this standard and value in Singapore usually requires a booking or a long wait to get in, but we have never had to wait on a table even on the busiest Friday evening.Favourite dishes: the Southern Burger, Chicky Salad, Lamb Tagliatelle - but really you can't go wrong with anything on the dinner menu. For brunch, nothing beats the Red Shashuka

Positives:- An excellent collection of alcohol, and good beers on tap- Food presentation. We had ordered a burger and it came on not a very quirky slate plate. We found this quite unique.- Great french fries. They're big and flavourful.Negatives:- Food expensive and not so great. We found it lacked flavours, and was certainly not memorable.- The ambience. It's a very mixed up and confused set up. The decor says one thing, the furniture says another, and the EDM music does not gel with either.We had gone out looking for a place with good burgers and a nice ambience, where we could sit and relax and have a nice meal. We were disappointed on both ends. Sadly, I found nothing that could compel me to revisit

Love the food and ambience! A perfect chill out place! Happy hour daily until 8pm (1 for 1 Wine/Beer). Good stuff :)I ordered the Southern Burger which was charbroiled chicken thigh with avocados, brie, lettuce, picked radish and mayo on a sesame bun. Charcoal sesame bun! For the side, you could choose either thick cut fries or salad.Read more here: https://jayellesays.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/blackbird-bistro-bar

Food here is ok, what one would expect from a cafe. Not overpriced, decent portions and above average. Staff here was quite good. While not exceptionally friendly, they were polite, knowledgable about the food, gave good recommendations and regularly topped up water. Lifted what would have been a 3 star experience to a 4 star one

Love this place for comfort food ie lasagna, burgers, shepherds pie etc. And they do a great happy hour. An abundance of staff often seen chatting to each other but paying no attention to customers. As a regular - sometimes 2-3 times a week - have never once been given a greeting or welcome back or any kind or recognition that I've ever been there!

Was there last night as I wanted some chocolatey stuff and my fiend remembered this cafe that we wanted to go to, and she had previously gone for coffee that she rated as not bad.I ordered an Ice Chocolate which was a great disappointment because it tasted like watered down chocolate milk. That is an immediate fail for me, sorry. I later noticed that one of the recommendations for this place was Chocolate Mud Cake, so I asked if they served cakes. Ordered a Chocolate Lava with Ice Cream (why do they always serve vanilla ice cream with chocolate lava cakes :( ok ok I know why. I shall have to ask for chocolate ice cream with it) and the cake turned out wonderfully.I should like to come back again for food, and the service is pretty good. Plus you get a nice ambience in Dhoby Ghaut (Am I giving away anything?), just don't order the Ice Chocolate .. and I don't think the hot chocolate either

One of the best places we have been to since moving to Singapore that serves great brunches and beautifully created meals!! Excellent service from the manager and waiter!! I will definitely come back. Great ambiance!!

Dropped in here on the off chance between going to the gym and a meeting. I ordered the tomato soup and the tomato and avocado bruschetta both were very good. I will come back.
5
We were surprised with the quality of food here! Delicious! We had the mac n cheese, seafood risotto, and kiwi burger.. all tasted delicious! Even the fries!!

Had brunch at Blackbird. Ordered eggs with toast and eggs benedict which were good. The coffee on the contrary was disappointing with very bitter taste. Have not been here since they closed for renovation previously. I've alwayd enjoyed their coffee in the past. Hope there will be improvements on the coffee

We were 7 in total for brunch on a Friday. We could get a table right away since the place was empty as it was Chinese New Year weekend. All food items and drinks were really good, particularly the Eggs Benny and the Croque Monsieur. Food took a little while to arrive though, not sure why as the place was empty. Service otherwise was good, and the prices are actually cheaper than a lot of other brunch places in Singapore. We'll definitely return

After our first visit we were really impressed - good food (Risotto and a fish dish which were both very good), attentive service and the only place we have come across Speights beer from NZ. The last two visits have been very disappointing. I have had a completely inedible seafood pasta dish and a vegetable and poached egg brunch dish that left my stomach feeling very unhappy (eggs weren't cooked through; flavour disappointing). I also don't recommend the soft drinks at brunch. My lemon iced tea was so bitter it was undrinkable even with added sugar syrup and absent any taste of tea at all. My other half's iced coffee was watery and bitter from burnt coffee beans. Sad to say after a first great experience it has been nothing but a disappointment and we are unlikely to return for anything other than a beer

I was immediately drawn to this cafe by the chalkboard advertising their tea set (cake or scones with coffee or tea) at an extremely affordable price. The cafe is cleverly designed to pull the crowd in and its open concept suited the local weather well. On the ceiling is a mural of fluttering blackbirds amidst a kaleidoscope of colour. Reading materials on a rack encouraged diners to linger around.Try the carrot and tomato purÃ©e soup. With a piece of toast on its side, the taste was at once tangy and sweet. I combined my soup with the tea set and I chose, without regret, the carrot cake. Inlaid with pieces of walnut, its texture was smooth, made with just the right amount of butter. The creamy topping made for an excellent delight to satisfy a sweet tooth. I was in-between movie screenings at the nearby theatre and for me, this cafe is strategically located for an afternoon of tea

Incidentally, this cafe is also a social enterprise as they hire chef who are hearing impaired allowing them a chance to excel in the cooking creativities.I had a meal with some friends and we all ordered their set meals and some small dishes to share. The main dish was the seafood squid ink paste that we all enjoyed. The ingredients were fresh and abundant.All the staff in waiting are very attentive and helpful, and knowledgeable about their menu which is highly commendable.Anyone who like a soft ambient for a relaxing and wholesome lunch, this is highly recommended!Was told that the cafe will open up to become an alfresco dining place in the evening

Was there during happy hour. Ordered a one for one beer which is quite reasonable. If they will allow us to sit at table of our choice, that will be better, even if only two of us. Did not try the food, so cannot commend. Good that they didnt charge for chilled plain water

My family and I have been regular customers since Blackbird opened several years ago. It's one of my kids favorite places. The food is always good and consistent and since the recent renovation the menu has been extended and they now have a bar serving awesome cocktails. The coffee is superb and they serve normal size cappuccino's not a bucket of coffee as Starbuck's. Quality over quantity. Since the recent renovation, the staff has changed and the new staff need to put more smiles on their faces and follow the staff that were working at Blackbird before the renovation since they were than and still remain super helpful, friendly and caring staff. Finding good waiters and waitresses is a huge task for owners of restaurants in Singapore but isn't it like that everywhere
