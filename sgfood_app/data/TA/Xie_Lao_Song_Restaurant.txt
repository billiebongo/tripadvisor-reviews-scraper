The food was quick and tasted nice. We had sweet sour pork and beef and veg- it was a nice meal. Free wifi is always a bonus.

Last minute visit to this restaurant, ordered two dishes and one rice. The rice was served five minutes before the main food, which is not what one would expect - the food was ok. Just one tip, they charge for the wet wipe tissues and for tap water, there is also a 10% service charge and GST tax

This place is amazing! I lived in Singapore for many years so for me to make a recommendation on a restaurant here is pretty significant. There are soooo many that are simply fabulous. But this is what I crave & where I want to go first. Smith Street has become very tourist, this is a recent development. We were coming here since it was a small hole in the wall on a out of the way street. We would bring everyone who visited us here and they loved it! You need to know what to order though. In reading some of the previous reviews I am seeing where they possibly went wrong. Not by any fault of their own though. If you are not an adventurous eater, don't order things you would never eat and then leave a fabulous restaurant a negative review. Here are a few recommendations of what I consider to be AMAZING dishes. Worth a side not here is that I love spicy food. So you may want to ask if they can make it a bit milder if you are not a fire eater!1. Most important SPICY BEANS! These things rock! Salty, peppery, hot and wonderful. 2. If they have them, the mini lobster. They aren't lobsters by any means. Welcome to Asia! For Westerners they are more like a cross between a crawfish and a shrimp, but with claws! They are in this ridiculously spicy oil. To die for!3. Cumin lamb or beef. It's mixed with veggies and this isn't a overly spicy dish but it is amazing! 4. Vinegar peanuts. Everyone we bring here goes crazy for these things. Unfortunately I have an allergy that makes peanuts difficult. But 100% of of friends want to go there just for beer and the peanuts. Chili, black pepper & garlic crab is a must have in Singapore. Some of our friends have had it here but it's not my favorite. It is a little sweeter than my taste. But it is always fresh so if you prefer sweeter then go for it! Otherwise best to stick with East Coast Seafood places. In a city that is sooooo expensive it is nice to have somewhere you can go with great food and a $5 beer! This is a must try when in Singapore. And it's right across the street from the best bar area, Ann Siang Hill, Club Street & Amoy Street.

Service was ok, beef & vegetable dish was quite nice, dumplings were good and beer was cold. I went for the chilli crab (which was nicely cooked and presented) but the chilli sauce was exactly the same as the cheap stuff I buy in a bottle from the supermarket at home ...actually I don't buy the sauce (or even like it) but it is in my fridge anyway. Bit of a shame that I mixed most of the crab meat into the sauce before I realised that. I would have given this place a higher score if only they did the crab justice by serving it with the properly prepared chilli sauce that it deserved.I think that the restaurant is also called Crabsong

Came here for dinner with friends on what we thought would be a lovely last night meal. How wrong was I. We started to order our drinks but our waiter received a mobile call and walked off leaving us sat there for another 10min. We placed our meal order which included starters and mains our main meal came out in dribbles and after about 30min most of our meal had come out, wish it hadn't though food was poor quality some of it inedible and when the starters finally arrived about 45min later they were just as bad as the main. I've eaten in China town before and would rather have the cheap cart food on offer. Would not recommend anyone to eat here ever. All you really need to do is go upstairs to the toilets and have a look at the fridges where they store food absolutely disgusting. Had I seen them before eating I would have left

Staff was very polite and friendly, even though their English was not perfect they took the time to answer our questions and explain the menu thoroughly. We ordered spring rolls and 3 different plates with some fried rice. The food was served rather quickly. Everything was fresh and not over cooked. Everything was delicious. Clean restaurant. Would go back

Lured in and chose this restaurant from the large number of choices available. Very polite staff, easy to follow menu with a lot of choices. We ordered three different dishes along with steamed rice. All the dishes tasted fresh and were totally delicious. We ate inside and the restaurant was clean, if basic. Overall we would certainly go back again. Really enjoyed the meal

I am still sitting here. I spike to staff and asked if they could do a half serve of the frog in case i didnt like it. More than 3 times i said half serve, half price and was assured that was fine. This did not happen when my bill came. Upon questioning it I was told "oh no no".I said "you said yes before though, I ask 3 tomes half serve half price" (i said it in numerous ways to ensure he understood and he said it was no problem each time). He just smirked when I questioned it. Do not go here! The food was no good either - the frog was nice but they put an awful amount of large chilli flakes on too of it and pepper corn inside so I kept biting on the horrible pepper corns. The female staff member was rude and disinterested from the start also. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Coning from brisbane top 2 % of reviewers from 35 different cities do not go here!

I was lured in to here on my to find a Korean BBQ eatery, the food looked good so I went - I sat outside even though it has aircon inside, but wanted to sit and watch the world go by...I ordered Sweet and Sour ($16) with rice and mineral water - the food came fairly quickly and was delicious. Good friendly staff and good serviceI was not told there was a 10% service charge automatically added to my bill, so be careful

The Prawn & Pork dishes as well as noodles were great, especially accompanied with really cold beer. The service was fast and friendly. It was still very hot in the evening & the inside tables were taken, we had the meal at the outside section & moved on
