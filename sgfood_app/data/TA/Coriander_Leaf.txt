Super experience with great dishes with masses of different ingredients and tastes. Well worth a visit. Sit at the kitchen as the cooks are very knowledgeable and fun to talk to.

Excellent service. Food is fantastic. A “must eat at” restaurant! We loved the Nepalese momo, beef brisket ,shantofu , Paranakan chicken and coriander rice. Will definitely go back again to try the rest of the menu. 10/10.
5
This is an excellent restaurant located in Chijmes. The food is fabulous and the price is reasonable. We were here with a large group an asked the server to provide a sampling. The price was $50 per person and the variety was exceptional.
5
Loved the food, the service and the atmosphere. a little pricey but well worth it. Also love Chimes itself as there's lots of bars, restaurants round and a vibrant place to walk around afterwards or before.
5
Ate here with a friend and ,firstly, the restaurant is beautiful upstairs in the amazing chijmes location. The manager is James who was a wonderful host and helped us order some dishes , all of which were fantastic. It is quite reasonably priced given the quality of the food and the ambience. I really loved this place and would surely return again. The only peeve is some of the waiting staff probably need a little more training but under the guidance of James, a truly natural host, I am sure they will get there.

We booked for Valentines as we had read good reviews. We were not disappointed at all. The location is set in Chijmes a beautiful old building, has a lovely ambience it’s just a shame the restaurant isn’t open to the view of the gardens. Back to the food, we didn’t opt for the set menu as there was too much choice on their regular menu. Between the two of us we had the papaya salad, which was bloody lovely, spicy though! The sambal prawns, rice, the chicken momo dumplings, the eggplant with naan and a garlic naan. Everything was presented well and the taste was amazing. We then had the trio of creme brulee to finish. Miso, ginger and vanilla, all very tasty. The only downside for me was $17 for a pint of beer, but in a restaurant in Singapore it is the price. That wouldnt put me off, the food is worth it. Check it out! Service was top notch too, attentive but not overl

We had the BEST meal here. We were served by James who was nothing short of fabulous. We couldn’t decide what to have to we ended up letting James decide for us - and we were so happy we did. Really wonderful, interesting dishes. Wished we lived in Singapore so that we could eat here all the time! Thank you James for making our stay special.

Just a warning to all who are booking, just ignore my rating. I had been in constant communication with their staffs on my big group booking for over two days regarding menus, area of sitting, deposits, and finally on the day before my reservations, they call to simply tell me their mistake... as this is for business I had to scramble to find another venue
5
The only difficulty we had with this spot was finding it! It's upstairs and kind of hidden. But, once up the stairs and in the room charming with attentive help. Kudos to the one-and-only James Kumar who is something between a maitre d' and a sommelier and a raconteur. James knows his restaurant and the food. He guides you through a selection process based on the fact of "small plates" and sharing. The choices are quite unique, even for Singapore, and the tastes fantastic. The three of had had so many good dishes and also dessert. We shared an excellent bottle of wine and then a little more! I can't say what the bill was because I wasn't allowed to pay but I know it wasn't cheap. Don't come here to save money; come here to savour the experience

We had a dinner to celebrate one of the friends birthday and she insist on visiting the restaurant because we need to accommodate to one of our Muslim friend. Since it served no pork no lard we are happy to visit the place. First of all the restaurant is tucked at Level and and its quite a challenge to find because the door that leads to the restaurant at Level 2 is quite small. In fact, we actually walked past it briefly and missed it. Beside that, the food is good. Servings were a tad small in my opinion but otherwise the food is delicious. The staffs are very enthusiastic in their service. They came over every other 5 mins hoping to clear something on out table. Not sure if they have been told to be that enthusiastic in their service. But I wasn't quite expecting for them to be visiting our table literally every 5mins, make me feel we have to finish something so they can clear something. Perhaps over staffed so that's why the staffs appeared to be very free and didn't want to be seen wondering aimlessly. Other than that, ambience is good and all else is great
5
Went there last night with 3 others. One of us is a vegetarian. As we have not tried their menu for a long while, we left the food selection to James. The dishes were for sharing and each dish he selected for us were yummy. The fish was very good, the dumplings, eggplant and very delicious. No photos, too busy eating. Will be back
5
A beautiful medley of flavors making even an otherwise boring egg plant also taste nice. To top it off good selection of wines and excellent serviceWe thoroughly enjoyed the dinner. We were 7 of us. The sharing concept of dishes means it is ideal to go there with 3 or more in a group. That gives an opportunity to taste more dishes. Definitely worth a visi
4
Found the food to be very good - small portions, yet delightful. The decor is nice inside, although I would have loved to be out in the open in Chijmes. -1 for me having to demand for a good table and also the small portions. Otherwise, lovely place
2
Local hawker food at a fancy restaurant with mediocre taste. Probably only good for tourists who want to try hawker food at a restaurant. Take note still water costs $12.
4
Good for dates or meetup with friends. wide range or drinks! More food choices please. Most dishes are in small plates for sharing.
5
First time to Coriander Leaf. By far the best meal and service during my visit to Singapore.The frontier chicken,soft shelled crab,steamed seabass and the Angus were absolutely delicious with the perfect blend of flavours. Last but not the least a special mention to Ellen who helped us with our order and provided us with impeccable service throughout the evening...her suggestions were superb and I would highly recommend going to Coriander Leaf for an amazing food experience.Will surely visit again when I'm back in Singapore
5
Amazing open concept kitchen with fabulous chefs. Sitting at the bar around the kitchen was a fantastic experience and very entertaining to watch over our delicious meals.
5
This was one restaurant recommended by a lot of people .. The place is decently located at victoria road near the raffles mall .. The food was amazing .. We ordered lamb chops , beef kebabs and tandoori chicken with naan .. Mouth watering .. Service is decent .. ambience is also decent .. price actually is g=high but for singapore is mid rang
3
The food was delicious but the staff could have been more accommodating since it was a large group booking.I advise you not to sit in the back room as it lacks ambience. Don’t expect to use the Entertainer app if you’re planning on splitting the bill
5
An excellent place to eat as always. Have been here 3-4 times and it never fails to delight. Definitely recommende
5
A friend who lives in Singapore recommended that we consider Chijmes for dinner on our last night in the city. There were lots of good options but having looked on TripAdvisor it was Coriander Leaf that caught our eye. We were sat at the kitchen worktop which allowed us to watch the chefs and chat to them. We ordered 4 dishes to share between two and that was plenty. The salad with soft shell crab was amazing, if a little spicy. Our other dishes: Nepalese chicken dumplings, prawns with pineapple and slow braised chicken curry were all amazing. We decided against bottled water as it was quite expensive but were offered tap instead. Beer was a good choice as wine didn’t match too well to the various flavours. Service was very good. The restaurant is upstairs so you need to look out for the signage. Unfortunately we were too full for desserts although they looked stunning. Would definitely consider visiting again next time in Singapore
4
Food was not bad though a bit pricey. Liked the garlic naan! The service was awesome too. Def a place worth visiting.
5
We let our waiter make the choices for us. He asked about likes/dislikes and allergies. He then presented us with a plethora of food that fit our palates and it was incredible. He did a great job with the depth and breath of what he suggested. We all enjoyed our meals and tried items that we may not have should we have chosen ourselves
5
Beautiful, tasty fusion food. Some of the best service I’ve had in Singapore. The staff really know their stuff. Slightly on the pricey side (it’s Singapore!) but well worth a visit
5
Visited again this trip to Singapore. Always a friendly environment with delicious fusion foods. Bit disappointed to see my favorite person James has moved on from Corriander Leaf. Ellen was fantastic in accommodating us, without reservation. Good chatting with her and other Corriander team. Recommend trying: crispy chicken with schichuan peppercorns, Nepalese momo, Lamb chops, Egg plant with chillis. Basically, you will love what they have in their menu. They just opened a new Grill style restaurant and cocktail place in Singapore. Will love to try next trip. Enjoy Corriander Leaf at ChiJmes!! Thanks Corriander Leaf team
4
Overall the food is very good and high in quality. Good for large group as the dishes are made for sharing. Service was a letdown; as I was told that there was a shortage of staff. When birthday cake was presented, some of the guests were not around. Common sense would be to hold off a few minutes.
3
Food is not bad but portions too small for prices charged. Would be good if portions are bigger since the prices are quite high
5
Excellent food and service. Recommend the lamp , beef kebab, burmese curry. Potatoes were spicy but yummy. Would definitely visit. Recommended for quiet and peaceful dinners.
5
Fantastic last mealIn Singapore. Every dish was delicious and the staff and owner could not be nicer or more attentive. Prawn salad, watermelon salad, frontier chicken, soft shell crab, beef kebabs and white rabbit ice cream sandwiches are among the not to miss dishes. Will be sure to recommend to friends traveling to Singapore
4
A great final meal in Singapore. We needed a wholesome tasty quick meal - we got that an more, ambience, friendly staff and delightful setting. Superb gluten free options. Very tasty. Not the cheapest meal I had eaten in Singapore but very pleasant.
5
Nice ambience, delicious lunch, tasty. We enjoyed the Peking duck with hoisin sauce, salted egg yolks soft shell crab, eggplant & the coriander rice was superb. Service average, can be better
4
I walked in without a booking, but they were able to seat me at the kitchen bar, where I ate while watching the kitchen staff in action. I had one of their signature dishes, which has consisted of chicken in a spicy yoghurt sauce, with arugula (or rocket). It was very nice, but then I prefer spicy food. For dessert, I had creme brule, which came in three small dishes, one flavoured with vanilla, one with miso and the third with ginger. The food and service were excellent, but I would recommend booking especially for a group. This is not a cheap dinner, but in my opinion, it represents good value for the price
4
The Coriander Leaf is a good restaurant wirh a high focus on presentation.We enjoyed fish, service and general atmosphr
5
My third visit to Coriander Leaf confirms prior visits that it is one of my favorite places when I'm in Singapore. Service is knowledgable, helpful, and timely. Menu is fun, interesting, and informative. Love the small plates format for sharing and collegiality. Favorites include the pomelo, eggplant, braised chicken, lamb, sea bass, crispy duck, Naan, ice cream sandwiches. Such a diverse, fun tasty menu. Biggest problem is what not to order....Chimes is a lovely venue. It is where I always bring visitors
4
Recommended by the concierge at the Fairmont. It was a sort of Indian tapas meal...very tasty and atmosphere was calm. The room was a little cool. There were other people there and it was part of a complex of restaurants in an old church...but you couldn't see the other places to eat. I enjoyed the meal.
5
Great food yet again. The small plates are ideal for sharing . The signature frontier chicken dish and a brinjal dish on a naan were delicious and had great flavors . Ample options for vegetarians as well. To top it off, the service was outstanding - special mention to Ellen. Will definitely visit again
5
Imaginative food and terrific staff. We sat at the counter and talked with the chef. Got his insights and recommendations. Did a mini-degustation thanks to him. Totally enjoyable.Highly recommended
4
Visited with a Friend before a show just along the road at the Capitol Theatre. Small plates perfect for sharing and we had soft shell crab and mango salad which was fresh, zingy with a little heat from the Chili. The signature chicken with yoghurt dish was also very nice and we had garlic nan to accompany. The ray wing with a fiery sambal was also very good. The sea bass was a little disappointing and the special of grilled squid stuffed with shrimp paste didn't mention the stuffing on the menu and not entirely convinced the combination worked. All washed down with a very agreeable bottle of Rioja. Service was good. Attentive but not overly intrusive. Singapore is not cheap for food but at $258, the quality of the food made it there or thereabouts in terms of value for money
4
The food was great. We ordered soft shell crab, tiger prawns, BBQ chicken (on separate seasonal menu) and garlic naan. The garlic naan was excellent and we ordered one more afterwards. Soft shell crab was very nice with good sauce which was nice to eat with naan. Tiger prawns were slightly spicy and and the sauce was great too. Only the BBQ chicken was too salty
5
The ambience of the place, its interior setting and service was good.The food was nice though a little pricey.The food has an Indian flavour and this place is obviously also popularwith the expatriate community in Singapore
3
Great tasty food but you need to know it comes in tiny bar-bites/tapas serving. You may have to order a bunch of things, like 3-4 dishes per person.
4
Great ambience: Intricate design, we sat at the corner table with sofa behind the wall.Professional staff: Staff was polite and kindAffordable: Worth pricing and amount with quality for the food
4
Nice ambient with great service. Portion of food was small but lucky 4 of us was ladies thus it was just nice. We ordered the garlic naan and it was very tasty.
5
Really nice restaurant, up on the first level so away from all the hustle and bustle and aircon!! Share food which can sometimes be annoying but overall done really well and they will adjust portion sizes to cater for more people. Very nice atmosphere, great staff and overall top place
4
We shared dinner with a friend here and enjoyed a succession of the small plates followed by dessert and accompanied with a bottle of wine. Dishes are categorized by whether they are "fresh," "familiar," "spicy," "unami," and "sweet," so we chose a selection, which included tiger prawns, salt & pepper squid, and soft shell crab, plus naan and the lava cake and avocado ice cream for dessert. Most everything was flavorful and well made; the banana fritters on my avocado ice cream were pretty tough. Given the size of the portions, however, we felt the total bill came out expensive for the three of us--given that we didn't order a lot of dishes overall. Nice decor and reasonable service, but with so many options in Singapore, I'm not sure I would choose it again
3
The restaurant had a great ambiance but the food was normal. Good service by the staff at the restaurant
5
Having visited in November 2016, we went back without a reservation.The place was packed, but staff did everything they could to get us a table. Staff were friendly and welcoming and showed flexibility to accommodate us.Plus, food and service was absolutely fantastic. I would definitely recommend and go again!
5
I have been going to Singapore for years for business and how I have missed dining at this place is beyond me.The food is absolutely fabulous.Service is fantastic.I am sitting at the bar as I write this after reviewing others off trip advisor.Watching the food be prepared and cooked with the banter from chef and others in the kitchen with myself and others was great as I was a single.You can have tables away from kitchen and quieter areas for couples.I have given very few 5 stars but this was a cracker of a choice.Not easy to find upstairs at Chijmes ( across road from Swissotel) but well worth the search.Well done Coriander Lea
5
Some very interesting, yet familiar local food. Really love the sambal ray - and gosh, it's really spicy! But very shiok! Lol. Service was impeccable, staffs/chefs took the time to explain each dish and gave great recommendations. My only complain was that the portion was pretty small, well all the more I will order for more :P Highly recommended
5
We have visited the Coriander Leaf several times and the most recent visit was the best yet. Sat at the bar and was entertained by watching all the chefs-in-action. The food was seasoned to perfection, beautifully served and very tasty. We thoroughly enjoy the Coriander Leaf and look forward to returning again and again
3
went there with a group of colleagues, well designed interior, albeit rather noisy. had a four course dinner. taste o - k, for that kind of price!
4
people always talk about the food in SGP. if you like variety with very strong and distinct flavor, this place is for you.the owner will usually speak to you and he is pleasant. the serving sizes are appropriate so if in question, be sure to ask. try several dishes with others at your table and have variety. you won't be disappointed
5
We were here as a part of a group and a cook out competition was organised at this restaurant.Groups of 6 were assigned tasks to prepare dishes with appropriate recipe and some help from the staff. Surprisingly the quality of preparation was very high.Had a great meal and truly memorable experienc
3
Fusion for the sake of it doesn't work, there are just some combinations that do not work. Sometimes a brave chef can hit on unlikely flavors that work, that was not the case, for me, at the Coriander Leaf. It's a Tapas restaurant with allusions to grand cuisine at exaggerated prices. Great service though, even though our wine order was forgotten. Singapore has amazing restaurants at unbelievably low prices, the Coriander Leaf is not one of them
4
Asian Indian food, soft shell crab was great, staff very attentive and have a great sense of humour, really good atmosphere for a couple or a group. Pick anything from the menu it will be really nice
5
We visited here on our first night in Singapore after reading some great reviews and were not disappointed. The food was AMAZING, the ambience great and possibly the best thing about it, the staff were so friendly and helpful. This restaurant would not be out of place in London and if they open one there I'll be first in the queue to get in. We asked to sit at the chefs table as on a Wednesday night it wasn't too busy and were rewarded with seeing all the food being prepared, being told all about the food and generally being taken care of by some really nice staff. Some of the reviews say the food was rushed, in my experience the kitchen was just incredibly well run, professional and efficient. If you wanted some time between dishes, I'm sure they could accommodate you. All in all a fantastic night, we recommend the lamb chops, momo, naan, and all the desserts looked amazing but we had the avocado ice cream and banana fritters (delicious).Thanks for a great evening Coriander Leaf (Chijmes), we'll be back when next in Singapore
3
My husband and I had dinner at Coriander Leaf Chijmes, after a friend recommended it for a romantic 'date night' dinner. The entire Chijmes complex with beautiful historical buildings and pretty garden courtyard in the middle is charming. Coriander Leaf is upstairs, overlooking the courtyard. We had booked for 6pm, the restaurant was quiet and we were seated in a large room, off the main room. There was no one else in the room and the decor was bland, there was little ambiance. The menu was interesting, modern Asian fusion, we ordered 3 small dishes and 1 large dish to share, plus drinks. The meal came out very quickly, the food was enjoyable but not memorable, we were not asked if we would like to order a second drink even though empty glasses sat on our table (a cardinal sin in my husband's eyes) and we paid the bill and left exactly 45 minutes after we sat down. Definitely not the leisurely and romantic dinner that we'd had in mind and quite disappointing overall
5
We spent our last evening in Singapore at Chijmes eating at the Coriander Leaf and enjoyed it immensely. The service was great with helpful suggestions and guidance on how much to order. Pre-dinner drinks were extremely good. The food had wonderful flavours and were well presented. The dishes are perfect to share and the service is fast so if you are not sure how much to order hold back as more can be added later. An excellent restaurant with a great atmosphere.
5
First came here with colleagues on a business and then subsequently brought the family. The menu is an eclectic mix of flavours from across Asia and its works brilliantly. The MoMo dumplings and the barbecued duck were particular favourites.A stylish modern restaurant, spacious but with a good atmosphere and particularly friendly and helpful staff. On both visits their recommendations of what to eat were spot-on.Order a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc - goes v well with the food - and you'll have a great evening. Will certainly go back on next visit to Singapore
5
This is one of the best restaurants I have been to, and we have tried quite a few in Singapore. The food is incredible with such a range of variety and flavours. The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. The service is incredible because they are attentive with a good sense of humour but without crowding you. I would definitely recommend a meal here. It was amazing!
5
The dishes are so unique that i can't define if it is Chinese, Indian, etc. We had the pomelo with soft shell crab for starters; peranakan tiger prawns and garlic nan. Go for the coriander rice if you need something filling.
4
This ain't your typical Indian restaurant. I would say this is more a fusion restaurant where spices and flavours are paired interestingly. However servings are not big, you would probably have to order couple more dishes.
5
had an amazing time last night. From the ambience to the food and drinks...As always, Samia maintained the quality of asian-infused. myself and my partner had a mind blowing experience. Thank you Coriander Leaf and team!
5
Really good option to try. Was pleasantly surprised with quality of diverse menu options. Service was really good and nice drinks menu as well.
4
A nice selection of food and attentive staff.
Lamb Chops were fantastic, and a highlight.
This is an upmarket Indian restaurant, and the food is very good, but the prices reflect the concept.
5
It was a Monday night in Singapore and my wife decided we should try Coriander Leaf based on the TripAdvisor reviews. We were so impressed that at the end of the night we immediately booked for the Wednesday evening: the only time we have ever done that after a first visit to any restaurant. However, we asked to be seated next time at the “chef’s table” bar directly in front of the kitchen and meal prep area. On arrival we were warmly welcomed back with some comments from the staff that indicated they remembered a number of small things about us from the visit two nights before. From there on, it just got better. Coriander Leaf is best described as Asian fusion served in a tapas style: small servings of dishes to be shared. Over the two nights we had some 12 different dishes which we certainly enjoyed. The balance of flavours and spices was varied and excellent.However, the experience was greatly enhanced by watching the Chefs prepare and present the large range of dishes, all of which was done with plenty of smiles and banter in the kitchen. The Chefs also spoke with us directly, showing a real passion and love for what they were doing. All of this was under the direction and watchful eyes of Samia Ahad, the owner and head chef.But the “pièce de résistance” was when Samia approached us at the end of our meal and shared her story and passion for an hour, offering further perspectives and tastes of her dishes (and drinks). As a result, my wife now says that the night is one of our top 5 dining experiences. Given that we have eaten in most of the top ten restaurants in Australia, a number of the top restaurants in Singapore, and many other fine dining restaurants elsewhere, this is high praise! I also agree, with the added comment that the dining at Coriander Leaf is comparable to many leading restaurants who charge much more for the experience. We will be returning to Coriander Leaf when next in Singapore
4
Great Asian fusion food concept. Food was very tasty and delicious. Service was very friendly and efficient. Wide choice of drinks. Slightly misleading Amex offer - buy 1 get 1 indicating that if you buy one main you get second for free, however it only applied to one dish!
5
The restaurant was booked out but we were craving Asian food and the menu looked great so we turned up hoping something would work out for us and it certainly did! There were a couple of spots free at the Chef's table where we were fortunate to observe a great team of chefs very passionate about their work. Recommendations were made based on what we had ordered already and we followed those and were never disappointed. The prawn salad was magnificent, followed by brisket, Nepalese Momo dumplings and Cobia. The pavlova dessert was beautifully constructed in front of us and the mango and lychee balanced the sweetness of the meringue. The wine was beautiiful; we even got a couple of tips on how to improve the evenness of the heat in our pizza oven. This was the last night of an extended holiday and the best meal we had by far! Thank you for such a great experience. Go to Coriander Leaf and book the Chef's table. You won't regret it
5
Was taken here by a local friend -- both our first visit and both enjoyed our meal plenty. Was rather busy so we sat by the bar, which was cool because the open kitchen plan let us see the chefs in action. Fairly good choices for vegetarians and calling beforehand they were friendly and helpful with the need to make a dish vegan.Great vibe, nice space, delicious food. Fish was the best and their coriander rice was fragrant. Would happily go back for more. Seems they had a lot of regulars dining that evening, we can see why. Though we were both full after mains, the desserts looked amazing too, though not vegan friendly because creams and all etc
5
We were taken their with friends and found it again as we enjoyed it so much. The food was very tasty, the service polite and helpful. We had the coriander rice, with two lovely chicken dishes, plus vegetable dish then lava dessert- wow. three dishes, plus rice plus nan; easy enough for both of us. Lovely meal. Highly recommended
5
Went here for dinner after being at Chijmes for drinks. Location is upstairs, follow the signs. Really impressive menu sorted by flavours - Asian fusion cuisine. Even dessert was great! Good wine list, and great value all round.
5
Beautiful setting in a former convent (Chijmmes). Excellent menu and service. Set lunch is a great value, but we also ordered many side dishes. Beef brisket bun and tofu dishes were favorites. Highly recommend visiting.
4
We traveled to Hong Kong and Singapore and searched for vegetarian places throughout. Happily we were able to find great veggie places in both countries. Coriander Lead has food for everyone. We thought the service and setting were great. The food is creative and well presented. The only issue we had was that we didn't know these are all "small plates". So we ordered from the first column and two dishes from the fourth column. Turns out there wasn't enough food so we ended up ordering another dish. The waiter was apologetic. Not a big deal but I think they get lots of tourists and first timers so a brief explanation of the menu would have been helpfu
5
The Coriander Leaf may be upstairs in the Chijmes complex in Singapore but the interior of the place is very pleasant and also the open kitchen a treat to see the food being prepared in front of you. The food was delicious, fresh ingredients and great balance of flavours with the spicy dishes being particularly good. Now I'm desperate to go back as this makes the Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants in the U.K. look on the whole poor indeed!
5
I visited this restaurant for dinner on a busy saturday evening, ofcourse the restaurant was full and busy!For us vegetarian bunch who visited this place,the options were quite a few and tasted delicious. An amazing fusion dining experience with a tastefully decorated ambiance!Must try place if you are looking for something different on your plates !
5
This is a must try if you want to have a more upscale dining experience (but not too ridiculously upscale) in a landmark venue to get a break from the hawker food scene. The decor was beautiful and the food quality and presentation were great! There were certainly unique dishes that give you a flavor of Singaporean's eclectic influences in its cuisine. We were most happy with the tofu curry dish that showcased a palette of spices and tastes that truly made me appreciate Singapore food!!!
5
We recently spent two nights in Singapore prior to embarking the QM2 and prior to dining at Coriander Leaf on the first night had originally planned to dine at a different restaurant on the second. However, the food, service, ambience and welcome at Coriander Leaf were so superb that we dined there again on the second.Over the two evenings we sampled the Crispy Chicken, the Crispy Duck, the Angus Ribeye Steak and Samiaâ€™s Frontier Chicken, all of which were delicious. I should also mention the side of mouth-watering Coriander Rice which we enjoyed so much that we asked Samia if she would send the recipe which she has very kindly done and now we are back home I am very much looking forward to trying. The restaurant is located in Chijmes which is a converted convent that has been transformed into a stunning area with a vast selection of restaurants and bars to choose from.I would highly recommend this restaurant and if we are ever back in Singapore, there will only be one restaurant we will head for and that is Coriander Leaf
4
Great food, high quality ingredients. Nice to have different cuisines in one menu. All dishes were great, especially the lamb chops. Service was attentive and professional. Why only a rating of 4? The restaurant atmosphere was a bit lacking. No outside tables, and the space did not feel very cosy
5
Wanted a break from the food courts and chose Coriander Leaf. Not disappointed, and there are hundreds of choices in Singapore. The first attraction was Chijmes, which is an old convent which has been transformed into a beautiful space for restaurants. The lighting and atmosphere make this place really magical in the evening. It is a relaxed place where food and friends come together in a spectacular setting. One slight disappointment was the location which is upstairs, and a little away from the main courtyard. It would have been nice to have some views of the outside. We enjoyed everything we ordered. They even have a separate menu with vegetarian options segregated out. I would say that prices are moderate for smallish servings. It is like a small plates menu, with the idea of tasting many items and sharing. Probably 2 menu items per person. The braised beef brisket deserves special mention, as does the crispy duck mandarin pancake, and the Nepalese chicken momo. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Very nicely presented. Service was attentive and reasonably quick.
5
During a workshop in Singapore our hosts arranged for a group meal here and also arranged a set menu with multiple choices.It was a very hard choice as they were all so good and you really wanted to try more than one of them.Its a real mix of asian or rather asian flavours but mixed together so its not one country or another its a union of multiple resulting in a very different experience
5
We were a group of four and ordered a variety of dishes to share. This was lucky because all of the food was delicious and it would have been a shame to miss any of it. Service was friendly and helpful.
1
...then you should not close the kitchen 22.00. Why would anyone care when you close the restaurant? What people care about is when the last order is at! Disappointed...
5
One of the best small plates pan Asian cuisine restaurants I have been too. Service was excellent. Bit pricy. But for a special ocassion its a great treat.
5
Had a fantastic supper on our last night in Singapore. We sat at the bar facing the kitchen and were treated to expert advice from the head chef on our combination of dishes. Started with an Asian twist on G&Ts and had Sake with our selection of dishes to share: Samia's signature frontier chicken with the garlic naan bread, barbecued ray fin with the coriander rice and then the oven roasted rib eye before the spiced varlhona lava cake (definitely, food heaven) and white rabbit ice cream sandwiches. The most interesting and delicious food we've had for many years across many countries. Spicy, but not too hot. Staff were charming with just the right level of attention. And Samia signed a copy of her cookery book for us too. Please come to London
5
This restaurant is truly special and you will not be disappointed with its unique tapis style Pan-Asian cuisine. The menu is constantly changing so don't be surprised to see items come and go as they are constantly experimenting with their dishes. We really enjoyed the beef brisket buns and the tiger prawns, but the highlight was the lamb. Everything is made fresh on-site so definitely a special restaurant, one of the best in Singapore that I have experienced
5
I'm personally not a fan of sharing dishes but that was the recommendation on arrival. Choose three dishes each. I'm also pretty particular about what I eat... not overly keen on seafood however this was invariably chosen by one of my friends. While what came out, while small in serving size... was certainly gourmet and the taste was fantastic. I even LIKED the sea bass!! The restaurant is located upstairs at Chijmes so misses out on that outdoor feel but the decor Is modern and the layout well appointed so you aren't missing out on much. Service was excellent - very attentive staff. A great place to go if you are wanting some intimacy or the chance to talk. Highly recommend a visit!

My wife and I decided to return to Coriander Leaf on a whim last Saturday. It better than ever! The staff are just wonderful - they kill you with kindness and attention. This is a superbly run restaurant - even before you get to the food. We had our favorite dishes - memorable stuff and we never get tired of their signature chicken dish. Interestingly, they have a separate menu for vegetarians - its just an extract from their main menu but it obviously it makes it easier for vegetarians to identify their dishes rather than sift through the main menu. Good thinking!Also, they have revamped their wine list with some very interesting Italian, Aussie and Kiwi wines. There is a superb Pinot Noir from Bellvale (2007 vintage if my memory serves me correctly) - a serious Burgundy look a like if ever there was one - just lovely and not overly expensive. Also, they have a couple of aged iconic Aussie reds from the early 2000's that look to be excellent value (we did not try any but they look to be great value). We had a glass of their house pour Clare Valley Riesling (by Tim Adams none the less!) Goes well with the more spicy dishes.We love this place - its great food and good value for money

We just wanted a light lunch of local cuisine. We found the place at Corriander Leaf! The menu was structured simply by 5 flavour type columns with the relevant 5 - 7 dishes in each column. There were 4 set menu options that all looked great on the next table but a little large for what we wanted. We had 3 small plates that were each scrumptious and in total enough to satisfy us. The plates were S$16-20 each though there were some much more.Great flavours,value and service what more can a guy want?! In the CHIJMES complex one block from Raffles so convenient

We were there for dinner, and we were first greeted by this grand-looking door at the entrance of the restaurant. The wait staff were very friendly and made you feel at home.We were seated at the bar-top table facing the kitchen. It was an interesting view to behold as we got to see how food were prepared here. It's also interesting to see that some fresh vegetables were being plucked off the pot to be used in certain dishes and dessert.We ordered our main courses from the "Umami" category - soft shell crab and miso-marinated silver cod. They were served in small portions but sufficiently filling. The soft shell crab and the salted duck egg yolk sauce went together very very nicely. The cod fish was done the way we like it, soft and tender and fresh.For desserts, we had the spiced Valrhona lava cake and the avocado ice cream with fried banana fritters. The lava cake comes with an extremely interesting twist to the taste buds. Indian spices were very beautifully merged with the chocolate to make this cake. The avocado ice cream was extremely creamy and it's just perfect for avocado lovers. According to the manager/boss, their ice cream is made fresh in the kitchen from the real fruit itself. Cost-wise, it seems a little steep though, for a small portion serving. It could be due to the location. But food quality and service in this restaurant, there's no denying that they are tip-top

Absolutely fabulous food. A separate vegetarian menu and food so full of flavour and incredibly inventive. I sat at a stool facing the kitchen and the chefs were very friendly and hygiene was as expected. Super clean kitchen. the food is expensive but I would happily pay again for such amazing food. I did return on Sunday but didn't do my research as it was closed
5
We found it hard to fine this lovely place but are glad we did. The Manager James was brilliant. Food excellent, choices excellent. Seating very good. Would I go back...Yes
5
Seriously good food. Everything was delicious. Highlights were the crab croquettes and the kingfish. Chocolate lava cake is not to be missed. The service was attentive helpful and friendly.

Wife and I had dinner with a couple of friends one Friday night. Was pleasantly surprised it wasn't absolutely full. Ordered a variety of dishes recommended by the server and they were generally nice though the frontier chicken stood out. Pricing is probably on the high side for the size of the dishes although the quality can't be faulted
5
This is an absolute gem. The food is exceptional and the chef oversees every dish which leaves the kitchen so attention to detail is first class. We had no idea what to order so went totally with Monica's recommendations were perfect. I asked for a bit more spice with one of the dishes and the head chef knocked up a mindblowing sauce. I will be bac

I don't usually review unless insanely amazing or horrendous but this place is fab and I will tell you why :)Service: We have been twice, about 6 months apart and the wonderful Singaporean Indian waiter recognised us the 2nd time, remembered where we sat etc. He is fantastic at his job, so warm and hospitable both times, loves to chat but not too much, make a joke but not too much, offer recommendations, keep checking you're enjoying the food, he really makes you feel welcome. He was great both times we've visited and so was the lovely lady that also served us the 2nd time. Seriously the best service anywhere in SG in this place! (and I've been in SG 7years). Eg, 2nd visit, sat at table, I tell boyfriend to pick whatever he wants from the menu and apologise to waitress that I can't eat, absolute hellish day, I have no appetite at all. She is on my wavelength and suggests we start with some wine and makes a great recommendation - WINNER! Then she empathises with me, but tells me everyone has to eat and I should try.. she asks what my favourite food and flavours are, what they could whip up that I wouldn't be able to refuse.. When in your life has a server ever cared enough about you to ask this? (anywhere in the world - let alone SG famous for awful service..). So the bf orders loads because the food is amaze! She comes back and jokes that I'm now smiling and laughing and she's glad I'm managing to eat some.. What an absolutely lovely person, really warm and sweet.Food: Fusion mix of Indian and Chinesey flavours.. served in small plates for sharing. Really lovely good, beautifully presented and also really good wine! Price wise it's a little on the high side but I think worth it.Tips - We went after work on a Friday circa 7pm and it was nice and busy, atmosphere etc. We also wandered up one Sat night around 9pm and it was dead, nobody in there and very quiet so I'd avoid this time in the future, for the price, I'd prefer some atmosphere. Tip for the restaurant - check the toilets are clean! I was raised to judge a restaurant on the areas they let you see, because you don't know what they keep behind the scenes! The window ledges in the bathroom were thick with dust, bits of toilet paper on the floor, quite tired looking.. just not what I'd expect.The only thing this place is lacking is a nice view really, so I'd recommend a drink after dinner in the gardens below. The church lit at night is beautiful and the location so pretty with fairy lights and live music, really lovely spot for a night cap

The food was interesting and tasty. The service was erratic. This could have turned into a disappointing evening as not one but two wine choices were unavailable. If particular wines are unavailable then you take them off your wine list. However we were offered complementary glasses of fizz which was acceptable. The puddings were very nice.
5
This is defined my favorite restaurant in Singapore. A mix of cuisine from the best countries of the world, from India to Japan by China etc... Very unique! You must try! We have been there many times and we have never been disappointed! Try the momo dumplings, miso cod, coriander salad, prawns salad and of course as a desert the white rabbit ice cream. You will love it. The staff is very attentive to every details and make sure you have a perfect moment in their company. Just love the place

Coriander Leaf was recommended by a friend living in Singapore. As it was our first visit to the country for, we decided to check it out...and sooooooo happy we did. Firstly, the decor is both fun, unusual, and romantic at the same time. Our wonderful waiter "James" truly added to the experience. He was knowledgable and helped us pick the perfect selections. His sense of humor made us feel welcome....and because my husband and I are both "foodies', he showed us their cooking school on site with private rooms. All spotless and well appointed. The menu selection for the class was mouth watering. We wished we had known about this as we definitely would have booked the experience!!... they also have a cookbook. The meal itself was a cornucopia of flavors.... different blends of herbs and spices made each dish unique and quite YUMMY! We ordered the watermelon, mint, pomegranate and cheese salad to start, the signature Frontier chicken ( divine) the sea bass and the delicious Ice cream sandwiches for dessert. Each dish was a discovery and all were wonderful. Service was impeccable and not only will we recommend to friends, but hope to go back one day on a return trip...

My wife and I have been living in Singapore for five years, and she recently started working at a university near Coriander Leaf. We thus imagined this restaurant as being one of our new go-to, after-work places for dinner. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. After two dinner-time visits, one sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen, we won't be back. Service was spotty, as described in other reviews, and the food was uneven: some great dishes, but others not so much. We rather wished that hadn't sat within sight of the open kitchen; we observed a few bad habits that, while not overtly unsanitary, would have gotten me chewed out big-time back when I worked in a restaurant kitchen. All in all, this was an acceptable place to dine, and we can see from nearby reviews on this page that others have enjoyed their experience more than we did. Fair enough. At this price point, though, it seems to us that there are several superior and more welcoming restaurant options in Singapore

My husband and I stumbled upon Coriander Leaf about a year ago and have been fans ever since.  Usually a reservation is not required however on Saturday evening to our surprise we could not get a table as they were full. We then resorted to texting Monica for a table for 6 people and WE GOT IN!! Though an earlier dinner then we hoped for.As our friends and I could not agree on which dishes to order we left it to Monica to organise the meal for us. BEST DECISION EVER!! Each dish which was brought out kept us wanting more. We had our favourites (miso cod, fried eggplant, frontier chicken) and new favourites (honey pineapple, steamed seabass, coriander rice). Do save space for desserts, no regrets. Wine was great too.Food did slow down later in the evening as the restaurant was full. Literally all seats were taken as they had another private dinner in the cooking studios. Staff did attend to us as best as they could, we didn't need much attention as we were there for a casual get together. We thought everything was perfect. One table seemed like they wanted all the attention on them which you could see started to stress the staff out as they could not attend to every table. We definitely will be back!

Food was good. Small portions, and prices on the high side, but worth the experience.
Service was lacklustre, staff were not really interested.
5
This has got to be the best restaurant in Singapore! It has maintained the standard of its traditional items and excelled in new dishes!
3
We ordered four dishes (inc Burmese curry, fish and spicy aubergine) none of which were that exciting, disappointing as we loved the restaurant when we visited last year.
5
Friends chose this venue and I was very pleasantly surprised! A lovely setting on an upper level in Chijmes.Great decor and fabulously attentive service. Meals are designed to be shared and although varied in what we each chose - each one was a literally a taste sensation! This is one of those places you will definitely come back to. Possibly more formal that some of the other dining establishments a great place to go as a group or on a date. Not a cheap experience but taste is definitely reflected in the price. Highly recommend
4
The place is nice, interesting menu selection, ok prices, very fine food... But the service is simply singaporean, not european. If you want anything just ask for it ... Do not expect the staff to be "obliging". Not in the singlish vocabulary. A bit cold and pretty Zen decoration ... Or lack thereof but really worth the culinary experience
4
I had a tasty dinner here a few nights ago with my girlfriends. Standout service. One of my friends is vegetarian and does not eat egg and she had informed the restaurant, and they prepared a separate menu with options for her. And when the group ordered dishes like the beef in steamed buns, they made a couple up with braised mushrooms. I shared the vegetarian dishes with her, and it was both filling and delicious. We enjoyed every dish except for the spinach though the wait staff praised it highly. Go with an adventurous spirit and you'll be surprised. Portions are small so we had fun ordering a wide number to taste. It can be noisy when it is crowded
4
We had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and finally made a booking. The menu is different to others in Singapore with an interesting combination of ingredients and flavours. We enjoyed all the mains especially the tandoori chicken. The Chairman Mao potatoes were spicier than we expected. Save room for dessert as the pavlova is as good as Mum used to make. For car parking, the basement car park is very small, so best to park across the road in Raffles City or Raffles Hotel and walk
3
I wanted to love Coriander Leaf but was rather disappointed. Misses: Service was just awful. Not once a smile or Thank you or What can I get for you. Wait staff never once came to the table to ask about drinks, take an order or clear away food without being called. The first table we sat at had water leaking from the AC, and when we asked to be moved, no apology, she just nodded and walked off. Our waters etc never made it over to the new table. Just pathetic.Kimchi also pass, inedibly over salted. Hits: Tofu Burmese curry, lamb massaman, garlic naan. Other dishes (including the signature chicken, duck, sea bass, lava cake) were good but not outstanding.Need simply stellar food to make up for non existent service, and this wasn't it.
4
The menu was captivating- every dish looked enticing and the blends of flavours were seamlessly gorgeous. The portion size was small, liken Spanish tapa style. We ordered quite a few dishes. A few memorable ones are- the sting ray- loved the heat from the spice which made us teary yet unstoppable. The tandoori was tender and juicy, every bite is oozing with the characteristic smoky note. Cannot remember any dish that didn't go down well We were concerned that we would leave the restaurant smelling like grilled meat since it was an open kitchen concept, but no! A great evening spen

We went here for our NYE dinner. I hadn't been here before but selected it based on the previous tripadvisor reviews. I may have had too high expectations but i wasn't WOWed by the food. The atmosphere was very nice and our server was polite however it was busy so we didn't receive great service. We ordered the steamed fish, duck pancakes, prawn salad and chicken. The pancakes for the duck were stale and the duck was dry. The fish was the best dish. If you're a tourist there are better local restaurants to tr
4
The restaurant was hard to find ,2nd floor of the CHIJMES building but certainly worth the effort. The food was quite unique, small dishes to share but certainly plenty. I suggest a reservation as extremely busy even for a Monday night.
4
Went with a few work colleagues and was impressed from arrival. The menu is interesting and has good options covering various cuisines largely as shared plates. The food was magnificent and well presented. The service was attentive and pleasant.
4
Very good Pan-Asian fusion-ish cusiine. The sea bass was indeed excellent, Vietnamese Beef Salad was decent, and Bak Choi well cooked and flavoursome.
Service pretty good, and overall not bad value for Singapore
5
I accidentally came across this place and decided to check it out and I am so happy, I did so. The food was amazing. Very light, refreshing and delicious to the core. The service was quite prompt too! We tried the steamed momos both veg and non veg, the pineapple salad, the pita and the dips and a lot of other things and nothing disappointed us. We'll surely come back
2
Tonight, the restaurant was pretty empty. Nothing but tourists at the few occupied tables. The night started off with promise, as the gentleman server was pleasant and welcoming. My date and I ordered 4 courses, a side and wine. The wine ordered off the menu was not available, so we were offered a better alternative at a "slightly higher" price. The wine delivered was less highly rated and 50% more expensive. We also ordered and receive tap water, but were charged $12 for sparkling water (shame on me for not checking the ticket before paying). The first two courses were pedestrian, while the next two courses were borderline acceptable, but not worth the expense. We were either taken for a ride by our server, or grossly overpaid for the service and food that we received. Either way, this place struck me as an over-hyped tourist trap that I would not frequent (or recommend) again.
5
when we got to chijmes, we was looking for a place to eat that was different.we found coriader leaf with the nenu outside but unlike the other restaurants that had seating outside, this was upstairs and inside (not a problem as it adds to the uniqeness).fantastic food that is here and the best part is that the staff and even the chef would come out to speak with you!! staff are very friendly and so jolly - they know all about the dishes and if you were new to the place, would give you a quick overview of it.mains was great - pan asian food, but the best was dessert! dessert was white rabbit ice cream and if there is a dessert in singapore you have to try, this would be it!the waiter said it was the most popular and after trying it i have to say i could not disagree at all!overall i would come back to this place again not just for the food, but the staff and the atmosphere of the place!
5
We were recommended this lovely restaurant and weren't disappointed. It was in the Chijmes complex,near Raffles, you definitely need to book. We had several sharing plates including the signature chicken dish and the vegetarian Burmese curry ( exceptional ) . The staff were a delight, as was the chef, who came to speak to us after we had sent our compliments, he had recently been to Burma to research additions to the menu. It was all delicious
5
This is not the first time we are visiting the charmingly different Chjimes complex, but when a friend of mine recommended it to us for a family meal, we said 'Wny not?'. By the time the evening wound down this Sat, we were truly delighted with the choice of fare on offer at Coriander Leaf! We started with Momos & Spinach parcel as Starters and ordered for the main course, an exotic ensemble of Burmese Curry, Tofu in tamarind sauce & Chairman Mao Potato with Nasi Ulam and each item seemed to taste better than the other and we were in for a feast covering multiple cultures! We concluded with Lava Cake with Ice cream, where the cake virtually melted in our mouths!! The service was courteous, attentive & prompt and we were little surprised to see all tables taken very soon into the night! We are certainly returning to check out what's left in the menu card
3
Interesting ingredients used. Was there once for dinner and went back for lunch yesterday. Reasonably priced! Had the sambal fish, soft shell crab, spicy chickens ...all good. They service like small plates. For 2pax, u can order like 4-5 dishes ... Good for friends or causal biz lunch/dinner... Decor is ok too.
5
Situated in the fantastic Chymes dinning complex, Coriander Leaf is a very hip and cool dining experience. The staff are friendly and welcoming and even though I was a sole dinner that night I certainly didn't feel alone. I chose the Crispy duck with pancakes which was very flavoursome and fresh. The Creme brulle trio was amazing, classic, ginger flavour and a very interesting meso flavour. Definitely my best meal in Singapore
5
Title says it all. And the ambience and service was fab too. Really enjoyed the experience. I have already told all my friends and family.
5
Great food, great service, nice ambience, price was reasonable in view of location and food quality.
4
Don't get intimated by the Asian interiors of this place. Because I think it is looks really nice and hip.
The food is quiet good. Using fresh ingredients. Very interesting and flavorful.
5
Dined here pre-theatre recently. The menu was great, and all our dishes were really fresh, with great tastes. The miso cod, the breads, the prawn salad and the creme brûlée were all excellent. They made sure they got us out in time without rushing the service. Look forward to going back
5
By far the most flavoursome authentic Asian food and knowledgeable energetic staff we've experienced over seven days in Singapore! Food that everyone enjoyed: children, parents and grandparents. Lots of vegetarian dishes that blend in nicely with the rest of the extensive share plate menu. Here they enjoy what they are doing and you can taste it
5
My husband and I dined at Coriander Leaf last night and we had an amazing evening. We asked to sit at the kitchen bench and got an up close experience of the chefs at work. Everyone was friendly and chatted to us as they worked and we especially enjoyed chatting with Samia, owner and chef, throughout the evening. She was very helpful explaining the menu to us as I have specific dietary requirements and we loved hearing about history of the restaurant and the concept of the menu. The menu is Asian inspired shared plates. I can't wait to return
5
Very interesting carte with a lot of unusual combinations. Very good mix between different asian tastes. The wine list is quite affordable.We had a group business diner in August (more than 20) and the service was very good. The restaurant seems also to be suitable for a couple dinning. Definitely a very good place for a fine dinner. Not so easy to find in Chijmes : level 
5
Sat at the chefs table and watched them cooking and plating our meals. A 6 course meal based on sharing. Do not think you will go hungry due to small potions...far from it. The menu starts with fresh tastes, then familiar,spicy, one more I forgot to the end which is of course sweets. Roughly 7 dishes per course to choose from. Was great too see the head chef so engaged with the cooks and more the food pass and then even spend the time to explain the dish. We walked out totally satisfied and thought it was worth every cent. As they say 'the sign of a good restaurant is the fact you would return'............hands down YES...........so much more on the menu I would love to try.
4
Brought my mom for her birthday lunch as they have vegetarian options. Was pleasantly surprised by the food. It was marvelous! Excellent ambience in the restaurant as well. Will return again with friends for dinner.
5
For a first time visitor, the location of Coriander Leaf in the CHIJMES compound was enchanting. The place had an almost magical quality, very pretty and relaxing. It was busy but not crowded. The interior of the restaurant was relaxed and modern, with an Asian touch. We were very well looked after, service was friendly and attentive. The menu is suitably short, with a good mix of choices. The servings were small, which meant even couples can enjoy several dishes. The charcoal grilled minced shrimp on sugar cane was very tasty. The sweetness of sugar cane was a good contrast to the shrimp. Steamed Venus clams in tamarind, coconut water and calamansi reminded me of the Filipino dish sinigang. The watermelon, mint, pomegranate with Turkish white cheese was excellent! It was beautifully presented, the colours appetising. The tandoori chicken would have been perfect for tandoori lovers, but was a bit too spicy for us who wanted to be adventurous but normally averse to hot food. But the butter naan was very good and we managed to finish it even without much accompaniment. Soft shell crab with salted egg yolk sauce was very good. Finally, our Nepalese minced chicken momo dumpling was, to me, the highlight of the evening. The only regret is it came when we were getting to the end of our capacity. Too bad we had no room for dessert.
4
Nice setting, cozy atmosphere, good variety of food, dishes very tasty and well presented, attentive service. Will visit again and recommend to friends.
4
In a Asian-cosmopolitan atmosphere one gets all the tastes of Asian cuisine if you would leave it to the chef, the owner or the waiters. I was impressed by their knowledge of the dishes and what the customer would desire. As if they could read our minds. I enjoyed the variety of vegetarian dishes which were served in small quantities (tapas style), enough to 'make you fall in love in small but sure steps'. Service was great, and the selection wines served was good. I loved the vibrancy in the restaurant, people from all walks of life enjoying, laughing and eating
3
Good food. Wife and I shared the Signature Frontier Chicken, Beef Kebab and Salt and Pepper Squid. Solid execution, reasonable portions.Nice vibe. Loved the interior, cool open kitchen setup.Poor service. Zero visibility on when each dish will be served. Long delay for the final dish (the Signature Chicken) came without an apology--took a full hour to serve 3 dishes
4
The eggplant dish was the highlight for me (ordered the version non-spicy). My friend enjoyed the soft shelled crab the most. The portions were perfect for sharing.Service was genuinely good and with smiles all around.Will definitely return and likely make this one of my regular spots
3
Actually surprised to read the reviews . At best average. The herbed rice was absolutely tasteless. The portions are tiny and the menu looked very confused. Service is pretty good though and the staff made all effort to explain the menu. The lamb chops wee excellent though. Very tender succulent and spiced just nice
5
We visited Coriander Leaf with friends. At first we were a bit disappointed that there was no outside searing area but the mood changed when the restaurant manager explained the menu. He referred to their cuisine as 'Pan Asian'. Having a closer look we understood where this term came from. We recognized dishes from Pakistan, Nepal and India. Fresh chili and coriander (of course!) were part of the description. Service was outstanding and we enjoyed the salad with Watermelon, Pomegranate and White, Cheese the Charcoal grilled baby lampchops, Samia signature frontier chicken, Clai oven fired beef kebab and the Stir fried eggplant just to name a few. With 4 people we ordered 9 main dishes to share and 5 side dishes. Each dish was a culinary miracle in itself with spectacular flavors and original combination of ingredients. Mrs. Samia is a gifted chef and Coriander leaf should be named among the top restaurants in Singapore! We will be back.
5
Went for a business lunch and was really impressed by the food and service. the venue was gorgeous with a lovely atmosphere but what made a difference between this and other restaurants in Singapore was the service. Highly rated
5
What a fabulous meal - the fusion of taste was brilliant. Not the easiest to find but I'm glad we did. We will be backThe white rabbit ice cream was yummy- mind it all wa
5
The selection was fantastic. Every painstakingly manicured dish from the far-flung reaches of Asia was prepared masterfully and delivered promptly. The quality of the presentation, however was only matched(and often exceded) by that of the taste. Take, for example, Chairman Mao’s personal favorite dish, the wok-fried julienne potatoes with szechuanese peppercorns and dried chili. Every bite of this meal released the juicy, subdued flavors of the sliced potatoes, and starkly contrasted them with the roaring, yet aromatic flame, from the cinder red chilies. The dish itself seemed to imitate the fiery, yet calculating demeanour of the revolutionary himself. In quick succession, we were offered the watermelon salad with Turkish cheese. It served as an elegant counterweight to the wok-fried potatoes in both composition, and taste. While the szechanese dish burned, the salad cooled. The lightness of the juicy watermelon, and the crunchy pomegranate balanced out the starchy, dripping sliced potatoes that served as predecessor. The Turkish cheese added a crumbling texture, and tangy taste to the sweet, juicy dish. We were then served Samia’s frontier chicken, which was a sumptuous meal, with juicy chicken pieces complemented by the tangy lemon and chili within the meal. To follow, we were then treated to the divine Nepalese, momo chicken dumplings, which were without doubt my favorite item on the menu. Just before they served us the unique, and creamy Avocado Ice-cream, a welcome break from Singapore’s hackneyed ‘green-tea,’ fare, we were treated to Korean brisket, kimchi, all served atop a fluffy steamed-bun. The moisture in the bun, and the spice of the kimchi served as a moderating bed for the smoky flavor of the succulent brisket to lie on. In short, the meal was a treat from beginning to end. Great service and presentation combined with excellent food has left my family and I pining for more. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone in Singapore, and anyone planning to visit. As a post-script, I should note that the opportunity to watch Samia herself lead incredible cooking workshops is also a refreshing source of entertainment throughout the evening, and puts into perspective the scope and ambition of the establishment
4
I ate here on a Tuesday night and when I arrived the man said that all the tables were booked but I could sit at the bar. As I was being seated I noticed that there were still quite a few spare tables and during my time in the restaurant they didn't actually fill up. I have a feeling it was because I was dining alone. Beside this, I did enjoy my meal there. I started with the Coriander salad with squid.. it had ALOT of coriander.. they could balance the dish out a little more. Followed by: Samia's frontier chicken- lovely and moist and spicy, and duck pancakes. Prices were quite reasonable and they have a pretty good wine list too
5
Another outstanding dinner at Coriander Leaf! The restaurant continues to draw superb reviews, has excellent service and some wonderfully curated wines to match the cuisine.
5
As always amazing food served with grace and style. Great atmosphere with excellent service and delicious food.
A must stop if you are in Singapore. Very reasonable for the quality of food served.
5
We had a fabulous meal at the Coriander Leaf. The menu can best be described as Asian tapas or Asian Meze. The decor, the food and the service was simply impeccable. The stir fried eggplant was a standout. We certainly will be back next time we are in Singapore
5
We found the staff welcoming right from the start. Helpful menu suggestions were very tasty. All the food was delivered promptly and 'spaced out' for our enjoyment. All the staff were helpful and attentive. In particular, Monica, was attentive and cheerful. Would highly recommend
5
This reataurant is one of my favourites. Loved my main course and loved the desserts even more. My 6 year old child got VIP service from the friendly staff and a special seat in the restaurant to see how the dessert cook carefully prepares all the desserts. Im a huge fan. Ill be back. Natash
1
While we were seated promptly... After 20 minutes with no one asking us what we'd like to drink or eat we left.Unfortunate, as the food looked interesting. The cuisine is more Indian than Asian at a glance, but hey, we never got to try it.Also unfortunate is that we never will go back again as there is little promise the service will be any different
3
Nice, clean. Polite and friendly.And menu sorted interestingly by flavour. I must say that portions were nice, served up well and flavourful.Yet, it all sat oddly near fine dining in Terms of food quality and presentation, but not quite so in terms of its canteeny decor....it all didn't seem to a place for long-lunch or long-dinner dining. Worth the try if you're not taking a date there or expecting to have conversation
5
I had the best time at this restaurant for both dinner and lunch on the following day. At dinner, I sat at the bar overlooking the open kitchen and met Sania the chef and owner. She is so informative and talented, and her culinary staff were skilled, fun to watch and appeared to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. I had Sania's chicken, soft shelled crab, naan, the watermelon salad and sampled the creme brûlée. Every bite was an explosion of flavor and the portions were perfectly sized. I was traveling along, but would have loved to have been part of a group so that we could have sampled a wider variety of the intriguing dining choices. Lunch the next day was also outstanding, especially the tandoori chicken and again, the most superior naan. I highly recommend this restaurant for its fine dining and the courteous and informative ambiance of its kind owner and staff
5
Delicious Pan Asian small plates to share. The watermelon salad with pomegranate molasses, with a hint of Persian rose water, was such a refreshing way to begin the meal. The Indian style lamb chops were cooked to perfection. The signature Coriander chicken did not disappoint. The chicken with Szechuan peppers was a huge hit, but all outdone by the utterly delectable soft shell crab! The restaurant was very obliging in dealing with food allergies. I will be back
5
Had a meal here with a large group of friends a while ago and what an amazing time it was. The food was on point, the drinks were fantastic and the service was impeccable. I am pretty confident my friends would agree, was definitely the best meal we had in Singapore by far! Additionally, very reasonable prices...definitely value for what you get. Congrats to the whole team at Coriander Leaf, it was an amazing experience and next time I'm in Singapore definitely another visit is due! Or better still, open in Dubai! ;-
5
We went as a family and had a wonderful time. The food was full of taste. It is similar to a tapas style, small plates with a variety of options. The service was also to notch. We highly recommend this establishment.
3
Unfriendly and perfunctory service but the food is not bad and service is quite fast. The location is lovely in Chijmes. We had the frontier chicken and soft shell crab.
3
Portions were tiny and taste was ok, not great , considering the price of each dish. dishes were not well presented - again, considering the price.
3
Overall taste was ok. Loved the butter naan and dessert. Other dishes could be better if it wasn't too salty.
Service was good. Nice ambience with private area for big group.

Very creative variation of desserts. I had the avocado ice cream with banana fritters and it frittered my mind back to my childhood. Adored the slight bitterness from the avocado. Very friendly dessert chef, came out to say hi and gave me some home-made ice cream tasters. Very nice surprise to end the meal with! Definitely be back again

the host was very friendly, sat us promptly and made the courteous small talk. the waiter wasnt friendly, polite or courteous, almost like he wasnt happy to be there or serve us in particular. not sure. I understand folks can have a bad day but buddy, we were paying for the meal.food fell short as well. ordered the fried calamari, which felt like it was re-heated and overly salty - ie, not fresh, Clay oven fired beef kabab, I am very familiar with Persian food and this was a good attempt at getting there and the Angus ribeye which when we ordered the waiter didnt ask us how we wanted it cooked, a little less than average. this was lunch for 2.I think all of it could have been overcome if the service made up for it as it is a trendy place, clean lines, nicely done with a good wine list

Nice place inside the Chijmes ( old church complex) . Would have preferred outdoors as it is so beautiful . Ambience - functional could be better if they opened it up larger windows for a view outside.Food - small plates is what we ordered - naan bread , prawn , chicken , satay , salads , all good to taste different cultures - great for a quick bite and out - head below to the bars at Chijmes for a more livelier atmosphere 
4
Beautifully presented sharing plates of food and great menu. Really enjoyed the momos and soft shell crab in particular, naans were perfect but the signature chicken dish was just ok for me. I found the portions to be quite small and priced at a fine dining level, although this restaurant is more casual. Service was friendly and very good. A selection of cocktails would be a welcome addition

You allow 1 or 2 mistake to happen in a restaurant; or your dining experience/ event. If multiple things go wrong, something is not right!!! 1) A wrong order was sent to the table, 2) Manager highly recommended several dishes, but then all were sold out, 3) champagne we order was not cold, desert we order was left out of the order, blah blah blah... This is quite embarrassing when you take guests there and so many bad things happened... Food was very average , decor was very average , light was bright for dining experience.... Would not recommend it
5
This is a place where you just want to keep visiting.The menu of sharing plates really works and every dish we had was excellent.Crispy Sczechuan chicken,creamy crab croquettes and even avocado ice cream all dazzled the tastebuds.The staff really knew the menu,were good fun and provided immaculate service.Do not miss out on the best Tandoori lamb chops in Singapore.A good drinks and wine list make this place one of the very best in Singapore at aa fair price too.Rush there
4
Great reception and explanation of the menu with some recommendations
They even made some adjustments to accommodate our dietary restrictions. Thanks
Really liked the water melon and pomegranate cheese salad.
5
What a fantastic meal to finish a week of gastronomic delights. The food here is innovative and interesting and favours sharing small plates. It was most probably the best meal I have had in Singapore. The staff are attentive and friendly, none more so than James who is a brilliant asset for this restaurant. Do yourself a favour, visit Chijmes, and when there slip upstairs to the Coriander Leaf. You will kick yourself if you miss it.
5
We had a wonderful experience here, trying lots of items from the fascinating vertical menu. Monica was very helpful explaining the concept and the dishes, and made excellent suggestions for the four of us. James gave us warnings on the heat levels in some of the spicier items. We shared a number of dishes, and two kinds of naan, and had a really good champagne. The restaurant is lovely and the open kitchen is fun to observe. Food is an art here. We can't wait to return
5
It is in Victoria Street, where you will find 100s of restaurants in a beautiful setting. Enjoyed a mix flavor or Indian, Nepalese and other fusion varieties. Flavorful, great service, loved it and recommend. Went with a few business clients- and thoroughly enjoyed the evening- Fast service
5
Years ago I had been to the old location of Coriander Leaf in Clark Quay. I remembered the food was delicious, so when this restaurant popped up again on Restaurant Week's list for tasting menus, I thought we'd try the new location. It was fabulous. The staff was terrific at explaining every dish. The food was bright and innovative and showcased the best of Asian flavours. We loved everything from the shredded coconut and ceviche prawn Thai-style salad to the Beef Brisket Bun with Kimchi slaw to the amazing clams steamed in an absolutely sublime broth of tamarind, coconut water and calamansi. The surprise of the night was the best fresh naan our group had ever tasted! It was crispy, but not dry, light, airy and buttery. The perfect way to scoop up every last bit of the spicy Indian chicken. We would definitely return
5
Food is fantastic. The menu is organized by taste (e.g. spicy, umami). In practice, you need several menu items to have one meal, so you will end up with a tasting menu, especially if you share. I always like being able to see how the chefs are working, and the restaurant allows for that. Finally, service was personal, friendly and casual, without overstepping its boundaries. Exactly how you want it. So strongly recommended
5
Coriander Leaf, in its original place at Clarke Quay, was the first restaurant in Singapore that we went to, when we moved there in September of 2007. So were thrilled to try out their new location at the refurbished Chijmes. Well. The food is even better. Rich flavours, well combined dishes that are now portrayed in a novel vertical menu, a great sampling of all the variety that Asian cuisine has to offer. And I love the new decor. Fresh. Spacious. Ethnic. Love Lov
5
We went back to Corainder Leaf with some visitors from the USA (former S'pore residents) who were dying for some great Asian influenced food.It was a Saturday night so we expected it to be very busy and of course it was. The staff coped very graciously and cheerfully with a full restaurant and service was adequate given the circumstances - but it also meant we just caught up on all the gossip with our friends so "slow food' was a plus.Our waiter Marcus was wonderful - a very engaging Singapore/Aussie apparently. Very poised.Last but not least - our friends were delighted with the food!!The Chijmes complex is a very special place - great calming ambience in this old convent. Interesting just to walk around the corridors and look at the architecture. All the taxis know where it is so its not a drama getting there to and fro when you call a taxi.Coriander Leaf really is a quality restaurant
2
I enjoy and am proud of the strong flavours featured in Asian cuisine but the dishes we tried were too salty. We had the garlic naan, the soft shell crab, the eggplant and the spicy chicken. The last dish with yoghurt sauce was the saltiest and I had to down a lot of water to rid my tongue of the salty taste. The eggplant and garlic naan I enjoyed, but not dishes I would purposely go back to Coriander Leaf for. As for the soft shell crab, it was fried well but the salted egg yolk sauce was also too salty.This place has a lot of potential to make Asian food sexy and modern but unfortunately, it has failed to do so
5
Went to the newly opened Coriander Leaf at Chimes and must say that this one beats its predecessor at Clarke Quay. They have completely upgraded the menu and it's awesome. Lots of options for vegetarians also and small plates with lots of flavour. When dining out in Singapore, if you are looking for food that is unique, well prepared, beautifully presented and tastes amazing - this place certainly won't disappoint! The drinks are great, the lamb chops...OMG, I can't forget the taste and will go back just for them. Master Chef Samia and her team, we done - we will be back !
5
The restaurant was recommended to us by a friend. It didn't disappoint. Excellent food and specially the lamb chops were the best that I have ever had.
We will definitely be going back.
4
Medium size portioned North Indian food, presented in innovative manner. Service is also worth mention. Indian drinks options are nice...
5
We had dinner here, a group of 4 from varied cultures.
Service good
Food is delicious with a great mix of varied flavours. Recommended for dinners, don't forget to book in advance the place can get pretty crowded in the evenings.
5
Great food, very creative and unusual tastes. Very welcoming staff and very helpful. Prices on the higher end, be aware. Rest is simply perfect.
4
Let me just start saying that the food is just fabulous! Simple, elegant and perfect portions for sharing; and the presentation is absolutely stunning! Even as simple as watermelon, mint, feta cheese salad, but the symphony of flavors is mind blowing. Loved their signature dishes like crab croquettes, spicy ray fin, chicken dumpling and samia's chicken. Their lava chocolate cake cannot be missed! I highly recommend to try wines, especially Japanese Yamagata (cherry - peach). There is a reason why I have to put a 4 star rating, although food wise this restaurant has blown my mind. The service was not up to 5 star standards. The chef and the manager were nice, but the staff were not happy to see us coming at 9:00pm, which I certainly understand. Nevertheless, the service is part of this experience and, unfortunately, it has brought it down.
4
Lots of small sharing plates... We ordered a dozen for six of us..and with garlic naan breads there was enough. Delicious! Very spicy Ray fin was enjoyed by the 3 who like their food really hot! The salt and pepper squid was so tasty that we ordered more, and the tofu was fantastic. A lovely atmosphere and for Singapore, not too pricy.
4
The creatively designed menu promises an interesting combination of fresh, spicy, familiar and umami dishes, followed by a range of just as interesting sweet bites. While it seems pretty unusual to mix persian dishes with chinese and south/east asian cuisine it works perfectly well. Balanced flavors and pleasant presentation went well together with our selection of Coriander salad with baby squid, Rice noodle salad with duck meat, Samiaâ€™s signature frontier chicken, Soft shell crab in salted duck egg yolk sauce, Nepalese minced chicken momo dumpling and the Barbecued ray fin. The Valrhona lava cake dessert has become a kind of standard, but it is the teh tarik ice cream that makes it unique.To see the kitchen team at work is an impressive experience, and to see how Samia is present in the kitchen as much as with her guests ensures the best possible dining experience
4
This restaurant is in Chijmes, the former monastery. It is a bit out of the way on the second level, so you might not find it easily. We chose it for the cuisine and thought it would be a little quieter than some other spots. We liked the food very much. It is Indian-style. We would definitely return for a quiet dinner
5
Coriander Leaf moved its location some months back and it was the first time we had visited the new site in Chijmes.The food is even more sensational than ever. With its matrox menu you can pick and choose across the various ethnic styles.Whatever you do don't miss the Watermelon, mint, pomegranate,Turkish white cheese starter dish - we ordered two!The 'Frontier Chicken' and the 'Charcoal grilled baby lamb chops' are simply devine.Franky the whole menu looks 'different' and exceptional.Prices are modest by Singapore standards and you get great value and a very enjoyable experience.The wine list could do with some work but its still a reasonable selection ate acceptable prices (by Singapore standards anyway) Wines-by-theglass are on the list.Frankly, the food at Coriander Leaf is not to be missed - a great experience, especially if you have visitors to Singapore who want to taste a range of Asian influenced dishes.Highly recommended and won't break the ban
5
I was there for a casual business dinner some days ago, was presently surprised by this neat place tucked away on the second floor of Chijmes, Singapore. What I especially liked about this place:- the food: fusion dishes that were very creative and delicious; I have not seen similar dishes elsewhere in Singapore;- the ambience: the whole place has a unique and pleasant atmosphere to it, with the furniture and cutlery to match;- the price: it was really value-for-money, given the location and deco of the place;- the service: the waiters and waitresses who attended to our table were friendly and professionalIf I have any qualm about the place, there is only one: the servings were rather small, so for someone who is used to eating full meals, be prepared to leave the restaurant with extra room in your tummy.I would definitely visit that place again
5
We went there with a bunch of friends and each and every one of us were impressed with the staff, the decor and the food. Each dish was exquisite! Perfect service. Definitely going back again.
5
Loved all the dishes and the decor of the restaurant. First time in this part of Singapore and enjoyed it!
Dishes were very flavourful and staff very attentive. Sitting at the kitchen bench is great to see the chefs in action.
Thanks Monica for everything!
5
We went here for the second time after having such great meal our first visit. We weren't disappointed the food was amazing such great flavour. Just one of those places you have to go to
3
The service is rather good but the acoustic is bad! The background music is so loud that i can't even hear what my friend is talking even though she was seated just right across me. Go somewhere else for desserts
5
Had a great meal, good wines and also tried a few craft beers that they carry.The ambience is very nice and the dÃ©cor very interesting. Love the big art wall, the open kitchen and the screens and lightingThe service could be a bit better in terms of turn around time but then they are always busy which in itself is a good sign.The food items were all delicious - my favourites being the lamb chops, the soft shell crab and the frontier chicken. The desserts could have been better but then I think they are catering to an Asian palette whereas I prefer western dessertsoverall great experience and I have now gone a few time
5
Hubby & I went for our anniversary dinner on a tuesday and luckily there were only few diners (we were told that it's always crowded th-mon).The place is nice, good interiors, cosy ambience.Food was great (don't forget to order naan for UR soft shell crab sauce ) but if you're not into hot/spicy food, ask before ordering. We also tried the white rabbit dessert & it was awesome! (We heard their Lava cake is also good but we were too full to get another 1).Service was superb, which could not be the same on busy nights but they still try according to them. Food was fast & waiter is very knowledgable of their menu (inc drinks).Serving (size)is small but u can always order another dish :) price is ok, not cheap but reasonable
5
A gem of a restaurant hidden in an almost secret section of the busyness of Chijmes. From the first breathtaking glance as you enter of the modern decor entwined with touches of traditional pieces to the wonderful eclectic fusion of all things Asian to the fabulous service with smiles to the wonderfully thought out menu with innovative creations of interesting flavours - it was all part of a most wonderful evening with some old and new friends.Highly recommend it
3
The portion is only meant for 2 person and is quite small. That explain the price at averagely about $12-$20+ per dish. The food in my opinion is so-so and nothing to shout about. Ordered the lamb chop (best among all), prawn (Ok, so-so), egg-plant (very spicy), water-melon with cheese (appetiser, no bad) and viet pho with shredded duck meat (appetiser, this is disappointing). However the dessert is a total disappointment. Well at least for 4 of us who are all foodie. Order the goreng pisang (fried banana fritters) and white rabbit condensed milk ice shavings with jackfruits and jelly stuff. The banana fritters with avocado ice-cream costed about $14 (i think) is miserable because it consist of 1 banana cut into 4 pieces. Even if this serving is meant for 1 person, its still not quite enough. Avocado ice-cream is quite tasteless. The white rabbit condensed milk ice-cream is pretty interestingly concepted, however it turned out to be quite disappointing. It looked like ice kachang (local ice-shaving dessert) at one look, the portion of the various toppings like jack-fruit, jelly strips, bean curd (which is quite hard) etc are abit too little. Not satisfying really
5
This restaurant is on top of Chijmes but there are two buildings so maybe a bit hard to find. The place was nice on the second floor - we were in a room but the outside restaurant seems very noisy. We had a set menu of about 9 dishes - and the dishes were very small which is good. As it was it was already a lot of food. Some dishes were forgettable and some dishes were good. I especially liked the creamy spider crab croquettes - very creamy and delicious. The uni/scrambled egg with prawn sauce was nice but the prawn sauces was a but overpowering. The miso cod with eggplants were also very good!! There was a kitchen in the private room so it would have been possible to take cooking lessons if we had come earlier. All in all, its a fun place with good food.
3
When we entered, the host was talking to someone else but he came to us and asked us how many were in our party. He then walked away, gesturing to us to follow. Then we realised that he was seating the other guy at the bar, and not us. It was rather awkward because he didn't even tell us to wait, and he did approach us and ask us about our party, so we thought he was ready to seat us. The waitress, Monica came to save the day, her service was attentive and superb. Food-wise, between the 3 of us, we ordered 11-12 dishes, and a bottle of sparkling wine. The prices were a bit of a shocker...I did know that it was a asian/fusion tapas style place, but what I didn't know was that the prices are full/main course prices. So the tiny salad was $12-$14, which is what you'd pay for a full salad elsewhere. The same for all the dishes, $35 for a few slices of beef, $18 for a few pieces of chicken. I mean, the food was ok, the ambience is great, but I really don't think it justifies the prices. The chicken was undercooked, the squid was overly salted on some pieces, and bland on others, and the Coke was flat. If you do want to try this place out though, I recommend the rice noodle salad, prawn and coconut salad, spicy wok fried prawns and the baby lamb chops. The rest of the dishes were negligible. $380++ for 3 of us, I think it's safe to say I won't be returning
5
i had the opportunity to dine twice over the last week at CL. Both were superb occasions with attentive service, great selection of small plated fusion asian cuisine, all in a sophisticated setting. Could not have asked for more.
5
Do yourself a favor and make time to eat at Coriander Leaf. We had the most delicious and different meal there. The staff were very informative and helpful with their recommendations. My favorite was the Watermelon Salad
4
Really great food and even better service! The quality and the presentation of the food was outstanding!! Although the choice for vegetarians is not very diverse, they food already mentioned was really great.
5
We received good food recommendations from the friendly staff. Fantastic flavors and well composed dishes. On second floor which ment not so crowded as other restaurant in the Chimjes area.
3
Nice restaurant in the core of Singapore, located in Chjmes town, "colonially like" area.The venue is welcoming, minimal and modern style.I enjoyed the service, gentile and professional, worth to mention Miss. Monica very well prepared to give advice on the menu and attentive to the need of a customers.The food was good, an interesting Asian fusion with well balanced taste.the only reason to rate this place average (3) is because of the meat we got Tandoori chicken and lamb chops, in both cases the meat was not completely cooked (pink inside chicken and almost raw lamb). On the other side the Rice noodle salad and the oven roasted Angus where just great.I am sure, next time I will be in town I will give Coriander Leaf another chance, they deserve it
5
We found Coriander Leaf quite by chance and had the most delicious meal. The staff were most attentive and helpful, explaining the concept of the restaurant, a selection of small plates from different categories on the menu. We were not disappointed in any of our selections and would thoroughly recommend a visit
5
I am a vegetarian and did not think I would be able to eat when I checked out the menu online. I phoned the restaurant and was told not to worry and the owner Samia would take care of everything. When we arrived we instantly had our table ready. This was just the beginning of one of the best meals I have ever had as a vegetarian. All the dishes were chosen for me and every bite was like a dance in your palate. Ehat an amazing experience. There was three of us and the the the other carnivore devoured their lamb. This is a must if you are in Singapore
5
Four of us found this a great choice on our first evening in Singapore. The small sharing plate concept is just the thing a few hours after arriving at Changi following a long flight.Friendly, relaxed, attentive and professional service.Outstanding food - prepared with thought, creativity and care from fresh, high quality ingredients. The soft shell crab and tandoori chicken were highlight dishes.Among many great food options in Singapore, would certainly visit again
3
The dining concept is of small sharing plates. The menu is divided into different categories based on flavors (fresh, spicy, umami etc.). My partner and I ordered about 6 plates to share during dinner. I liked the dishes from the umami selection better than the others. The service was decent, not fantastic or anything. I don't think it's a place that I would think about returning to
1
We held an event there ,catering for about 60pax. How sound is traveling in the room, it was very difficult to even hear what the person sitting across me was saying. Worst the service and food was disappointing. There were not able to cope and it took so long to serve our very simple meal. The portion was so small we were still hungry after the meal. And it wasn't even tasty. Disappointing !
3
Food is good, rather sophisticated and the carte has a wide variety of choice. But it is very expensive considering the tiny size of each dish. They look like samples, not main dishes. It looks like a joke!
5
Excellent fusion dishes with great taste in everything we ordered. Loved their magic with the egg plants. excellent place for any occasion. friendly staff and not so costly drinks :)
5
I did an hour of homework on Trip Advisor before booking this eatery for my work post conference Dinner. I certainly wasnt dissapointed. Our Party of 15 were seated in a side room (private) usually reserved for cookery classes. We were able therefore to make a couple of presentations etc. As for the food, they made it very easy, the waiters just brought a selection of starters and mains in a banquet style for people to taste and share. Very communial and worked very well. The service for drinks etc. was flawless. Happy to recommend this eatery either for couples of groups, it works at both levels. Try it
5
A really memorable experience, this tapas style of dining really delivered on flavour and value. Watching the talented team in the open kitchen was fascinating. It was all overseen by the owner who with her eagle eye made sure that each meal sent out was perfect
4
My husband and I recently moved to Singapore and have been difficult to find restaurant - not super $$$$ with excellent service. Coriander Lead was a gem! We were well looked after by the staff. There was 1 guy - I cannot remember his name, he told us he is Indian-Indonesian mixed. His guest service was exceptional. Something you rarely find in Singapore! Restaurant has nice ambience, a bit quiet with a little music. Loved it. The food was very good, not excellent, probably we did choose the best dishes. Definitely we will go back, not in the near future, maybe take some friends along
5
Samia(the owner) has understood the full influence of all worldwide spices on her amazing dishes.Located on the second floor of the Chijmes Building you have to demand a counter(bar) seat...it is like sitting in the kitchen...you will speak to Chef and he will share a few secrets with you.This place is amazing! Best dinner in Singapore
4
We went to the chijms a few times and decided to go here instead of the Clarke River restaurants as the bars in this area are around $7 a beer instead of $21 a beer across the road where we were staying at the Carlton.All the bars and restaurants here look and smell great so why go any where else, The service was great but a word of warning, if you don't like hot chilly don't order the Szechuan cold chicken.if you do get this with the garlic Nan bred, its probably one of the best chilly dishes I have tried but not for the faint hearted, we had about 8 items plus drinks all for under $200 SD
4
My boyfriend and I, went for a cooking demo class, the Moroccan class with the Chef Samia and were not disappointed ! Samia has a strong personality and show and share her knowledge with passion ! She gave us the keys of how and why we cook the delicacies in this or that manner and it was a pleasure for our taste buds ! I will definitely try to re-do it at home and would obviously recommend the class for individuals but also for corporate event !!
4
Nice Asian influence restaurant situated in the Chijmes development close to City Hall MRT with plates to share style food. Ambiance, decor and service was very good. I particularly enjoyed their cheese and water melon salad and their lamb chops. Deserts were not as good with the chocolate fondant with masala and tea ice cream not hitting the mark on either presentation or flavour. Interesting beer and wine list. I would go again but would skip their desert
5
First visit here with a business colleague. Its situated upstairs at the Chijmes complex so can be a bit tricky to find but well worth the visit.Lively atmosphere and the service was great - friendly and efficient throughout. Dinner menu is composed of small sharing plates with a cross regional fusion... Indian, Chinese, Thai, Malay, Korean.The food is served as its is prepared so does not all come at once so its great to have these "surprises" coming regularly. we had 6 plates to share between two and that was a good quantity... but if you're hungry, its easy and quick to order more.Watermelon, pommegranite and Turkish cheese was a lovely, fresh sladCapre Angus steak was fantastic as were the Nepalese chicken momo dumnplings and salt and pepper squid. didn't have a dessery but they looked lovely too... they even had a cotton candy machine to add as a garnish to some of them - yum :-)would definitely return when next visiting Singapor
5
Amazing food. Great service. The attention to detail in creating these wonderful dishes was a pleasure to witness. Good wine selection. Attentive staff. Lovely tap water!
The lava cake is absolutely incredible.
Sit at the kitchen side if possible!
5
Couldn't have imagined a better and more enjoyable meal. Service was fantastic and the menu on offer is very creative.
5
We came across this restaurant upstairs by co incidence.
The food was really outstanding. For two of us we selected five dishes and was very pleased with all of them.
The braised beef buns and Angus beef were very tasty and tender.
4
We had read reviews of this restaurant and were keen to try it out. We made a reservation online about 2 weeks beforehand, when we arrived they wanted us to eat at the stools by the kitchen claiming that they were full. My Husband made a fuss and eventually we were given a table after they realised that we were planning to try most of their dishes and were willing to splash out on a few bottles of wine. Thereafter the service was very attentive and the food for the most part was very tasty. Be prepared to order quite a few dishes as the plates are quite small and don't fill yourself up with naan or rice. Would recommend the watermelon and feta salad and fried market fish which was delicious. The price was reasonable for Singapore standards
4
this was our second visit. First time the food was great, but the service was very average to bad. But last night the service was very good. We arrived with 3 more people than our original booking. The restaurant was quite busy but they were very accommodating. The wine list was not overly long, and didn't have 2 wines that we asked for. Apparently they'd run out the night before! But the food was delicious and we will go back for sure
5
Three of us ordered 2 dishes each to share. The salt and pepper squid was so tender. The duck salad with noodles was fresh, light and full of flavour, tandoori chicken excellent, Saimi's signature chicken dish was spicy and had lovely textures. The white rabbit condensed milk ice cream Was trying to be too clever, it did not work for us, too much ice. Avocado ice cremated with banana was creative and delicious. Our favourite was was mango and glutinous rice. A must to visi
5
After arriving at our hotel in Singapore about 10pm we walked to Chijmes for a late night dinner. This place was fabulous. It is a share plate system and we all ordered our choice and shared everything. We had Sting Ray, prawns, scallops, pork, vegetables. Everything was excellent. The Indian waiter we had was a laugh a minute and made the experience even better. Thouroughly reccoment this one. Not overly cheap but excellent food
5
Not a restaurant you would just come upon, you need to know it's there but a must go to restaurant. We sat at the counter and watched the chefs prepare, the food was just amazing. The staff were wonderful. A definite must go to restaurant in Singapor
5
Chimes is a pretty average area for eating. This place is a real find. Helpful and attentive staff. They cooked a Burmese favourite off menu for my wife. Subtlety of flavours are exquisite and a very knowledgeable staff who steer you round the menu. Been twice already and may go again. Watched over by the elegant Sammia who is the proprietor. Makes for a fun experience.
5
Somehow we found our way to this amazing restaurant and it was possibly the best meal I've ever eaten! Not being very familiar with this style of cuisine we were slightly overwhelmed by the menu. However since it is laid out by flavours and ingredients rather than starters and mains and of course the lovely and helpful staff things became allot clearer! Thanks to the ever patient chef Den, Dean? and of course the friendly owner who came over for a chat after service finished and all the staff there! By the way the best seats in the house are in front of the open kitchen! Thanks against guys :)
5
Food is absolutely outstanding, service is impeccable. One of those places that you leave without getting enough but you can't eat anymore. A big thank you to James his service and charm along with all the other staff added to the vibe. A must visit if you are in Singapore
2
Let me clarify, as a Singaporean, i truly support local chefs and the reason i am writing this review, is to provide constructive feedback.Amongst the myriad of dishes we had, a few dishes capture our ire.Steamed Venus clams, tamarind,coconut water, calamansi - The natural delicate flavors of the clams were easily overpowered by this overly acidic broth, nor is the acidic broth with any depth you would expect of a seafood soupy dish.Creamy blue spanner crab croquettes,tomato chutney - run-of-the-mill crab croquettes in a confusing tomato chutney that was in between a rempah based sauce to something i can't even comprehend. I'd prefer a strong sambal to this confused sauce any time.Tempura of shiitake, honshimeji,enoki, dashi mousse, soy dip - This dish needs serious R&D on the dashi espuma. The texture and look of the espuma is wrong. Mouthfeel, flavor etc needs work.Nasi Ulam - This was seriously bad. It's my first time whereby i've ate a piping hot nasi ulam, which main focus is on the freshness of the herbs involved. The high heat killed all delicate flavor, aroma & blackened the herbs itself. Basmati rice was being used here, and its sandy grainy texture (over-worked?) reminded me of eating stale french fries.White Rabbit condensed milk ice cream - oh my. That ice cream isn't even an ice cream. It's like a seriously thick marshmallow mousse. It wasn't even cold, more like chilled. Serious work needs to be done here. Unpalatable Fresh milk curd, rose petal reduction exotic fruit compote - Sourish notes (Not sure if yogurt or going bad, afraid to probe further) Couldn't detect rose petal notes. Saw a photo of the same dish on the official account, & this dish is marketed with white chocolate shards. If you're going to post a photo online to entice guests yet serve consumers with missing components, dissatisfaction will definitely occur.In conclusion, flavors were muted, technique is missing, more thoughts and work need to be done on the dishes. I've had a few more dishes but they weren't much of a mention.Also, if you are going to operate in a open kitchen, wearing gloves is nice to instill confidence in guests, but wearing the same pair of gloves throughout service, opening chiller doors, washing towels, etc. Not such a good idea
4
We came here for the first time I last night and both loved the idea of the 5 flavours on the menu. I absolutely loved the spicy stir fry chilli aubergines and my partner loved the soft shell crab and salty duck egg from the umami section. We were given an explanation of each section of the menu and Marcus was particularly friendly and was really informative and enthusiastic about the restaurant and dishes. The service was great and the rest of the staff were excellent, however it looked like the restaurant could have done with one extra server as they were really rushed off their feet, and sometimes a bit hard to get their attention just because it was so busy (not because they were not attentive). My partner had the lava cake and teh tarik which was super! However I was less than impressed with the white rabbit ice cream pudding with the sweet potato, jelly, cornflakes etc. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me. Overall though good and would visit again when we're back in Singapore!

Divided among 5 categories: fresh, familiar, spicy, umami and sweet, the tapas-style portions are perfect for sharing with your dinner companion. We ate the watermelon salad -- refreshing, beef kabobs so full of flavor, spicy prawns with just the right spice, and angus beef with a dipping sauce I couldn't get enough of. For dessert we couldn't choose so we had the lava cake and mango with sticky rice. Both were terrific. Lovely ambiance, chefs who love what they do made for a delicious and memorable evening. Can't wait to go back

I hosted a team dinner at Coriander Leaf and had a really great experience. The restaurant is very attractively laid out, casual and lively, yet sophisticated. The menu is categorized in a way I have never seen before, focusing on tastes and styles rather than ingredients or courses. The dishes are larger than tapas but not a full mean, one is good for sharing by 3 people. There is Indian, Thai, Chinese, Medeteranian, and Persian flavors, ingredients and themes across the menu but all of the dishes combine each in unusual and delicious ways. As fun as the menu is, it does take a bit of explaining and the servers provide good advice and summaries in a cheerful way. Was just a great night...even when the bill came...I was expecting the total to be much higher than it was. Two thumbs up, way up

What a night to remember the food was not what I was expecting. Being an Asian Nepalese Fusion Tapas style the flavor were outstanding and so different. I wish we had found this on our first night in Singapore and not our last as we would have gone back. The dessert was very special I tired the Lava cake with the White Tea ice cream I have never had anything like it. The staff wee very friendly and helped to make the night enjoyable. If in Singapore you must try this restaurant

Chose this restaurant due to its interesting menu and the fact we wanted to eat in the Chjimes complex in Singapore. The food here was simply outstanding. The best naan bread, accompanying a wonderful chicken dish spicy but well balanced with yoghurt. A clay pot beef dish with rice cooked and placed in a hot steel bowl to slowly produce a yummy crisp. Finished the most beautiful tamarind flavoured clam dish. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere lively but still refined. A mixture of locals, expats and a few tourists seemed to be all enjoying this restaurant. We will definitely return when next in Singapore

This restaurant has moved to its new location at Chijmes. When I was there, there was still no right signage pointing to where it is. It's on the second floor of the main building across the church. Its door is similar to those unassuming yet mysterious doors in some unique bars in the U.S. and UK. Inside, the restaurant has refined minimalist interiors on the black side. While you can say it's one restaurant that people in suits can comfortable find themselves in, some casual wine drinking and dinner here will work as fine.Marcus, one of the attendants, was very accommodating upon my entry. A friend had booked for our group in advance. Marcus had me pick a table and walked me thru the menu. He was kind enough to share a little bit about the restaurant and the take of the chef on Asian cuisine. I was proud to learn that one of the desserts, that in white rabbit sauce, was patterned after the Philippines' famous dessert, halo2x. While I enjoyed this dessert, I thought the white rabbit taste was missing. Two dishes that I liked the most, and I think should fall on the must-try list, were the Sri Lankan dumping and the Persian beef kebab. Regarding the wine: It really pays to go by the chef's recommendation. Marcus did a great job with our wine.

We found this place on our last evening in Singapore. This is a surprising place for Singapore with really innovative Tapas style dinin
5
Never disappointed with the food and service. It has a real buzz and is a happening place. Nice to see it has reopened for us regular customers - we come here year after year and have always found the food to be excellent

Coridander Leaf was one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, when I moved here in 2010, both for business and personal dinners. They mixed different cuisines well, from southeast Asian, to Chinese to Middle Eastern flavors. And their wine selection was always very good. But over time, they lost something - innovation - and the menu became stale, and I stopped going there. Eventually they closed a few years ago.So it was with delight that I heard they re-opened, and my project team were keen to give them a try, even without knowing my history with them. So we had our team dinner there tonight, and I must say, they truly delighted everyone. They had an array of diverse starters and dishes, e.g. - Szechuan cold-poached chicken in chili oil, chili, crushed peanuts and spring onions, creamy blue spanner crab croquettes with tomato chutney and coriander salad with chargrill baby squid and woodear mushrooms.- Miso-marinated cod fish, tandoori chicken, cucumber relish, mint chutney and naan, and Nepalese minced chickend momo dumpings.- Marinaed grilled Angusrib-eye with spicy sauce, and stir-fried eggplant, coriander, chilli padi and green onions.- And ending with dessert of avocado ice-cream, fried banana frittesr and gula melaka sago.How fusion is that! And they were generally all very good. My favorites were the Szechuan chicken, the miso-marinated cod, the Nepalese dumpling, the rib-eye and the eggplant. But all the others were really tasty.I will come back again - hopefully I can re-kindle my desire for their cuisine...but my wish is that they not only delight once, but continuously surprise customers with innovative and delicious offerings to keep us coming back

just last night 5 of us dined at the newly revamped Coriander Leaf. we love the new location at Chimes. the menu is divided into 5 categories, and we tried times from 4 of the 5. we didn't order from the spicy column, but given how fantastic every other food category was, we look forward to a return trip to try dishes from the "spicy" section and more dishes from the other columns and done again on so,e of our new favorites. The dishes are designed to be small plates to share. this is great. This is not tapas. These are genuinely creative dishes that come in small amounts so you have the opportunity to try many different dishes at one sitting. It is genius. It is recommended that you order 3 to 5 dishes per person. We certainly did that. each dish comes as soon as it is freshly prepared. there are several chefs working behind the counter so sometimes several dishes come at once, and then other dishes that may take longer to prepare continue to be served. I rarely give excellent to restaurants, but CL deserves 5 stars. We loved the dishes from the Umami menu. beautiful delicately flavored beef tartar, Nepal dumplings, soft shell crab to die for (and perfectly cooked down to the last morsel). Samia's frontier chicken from the familiar section was moist and perfectly flavored. several dishes have their own unique sauces -- the soft shell crab has a salted egg yolk sauce which has a surprisingly delicate flavored sauce. The eggplant , chick pea dish from the familiar comes in its own mini casserole dish and has a pleasant sweet tasting tomato sauce, but with middle eastern flavorings. again. Every dish we had was excellent, but to give a very good example of a traditional dish done excellently,I want to describe the tandoori beef kabobs from the "familiar" section. These are finely ground beef kabobs that look like smaller version of hallowed out cigars They come also in their own small casserole and sit stop perfectly cooked rice with a hint of the appropriate rice crust at the bottom. these are perfectly spiced with middle eastern flavors. they are not overpowering, just perfect seasoning wise. I have lived in different parts of the world, including the Middle East. this dish would hold its own against the best in the Middle East. There are eight items offered under the Umami menu, and the fact that CL can bring together dishes with influences from many different parts of Asia so well is a testament to the brains and talent behind CL. there is no doubt that the owner Samia is passionate about her food, presentation. And being crew rove and innovative. We had a chance to talk with her Friday night and she let us know that she has a new co chef who is also the brains behind some of the great dishes. in fact, the new co,chef came up with the concept for their gourmet Halo Halo. they put numerous tasty delights with the shaved ice including sweet potato (perfect cooked texture), frosted flakes ( don't knock it until,you have tried it) and the star is the home made white rabbit ice cream on top. They make it clear that this dessert is special not by Just the perfect mix of flavors, but also the piece of gold leaf on top, One of the diners was philippine, and she was very happy with this version. as big hot overall at our table? We are looking forward to the next occasion to dine at CL. in fact it doesn't even have to be a special event to go, We could easily be happy to drop in and sit at the eating and have a few dishes with some drinks or even just stop in for dessert later in the evening. we understand that CL will eventually open for lunch as well and that would be a welcome addition to the dinner hours. can't wait to go back. Writing this makes me realize even more how special and delicious and unique was the overall experience

Starting with the highlights of the meal; the service and the atmosphere were excellent. The whole staff was incredibly polite and very much wanted you to have the best time possible. The space was gorgeous and deliciously cool in the hot of the summer.Moving on to the food and the menu. When read the menu for the first time I was taken aback. Almost everything on the menu I would love to eat. The brilliant setup of the meal where 4 courses is a minimum makes this possible and I though I was in for a great night. I started with the venus crab soup, It was as I expected and there was nothing out of the ordinary. If this restaurant does anything it does it's basic's right. But that's where it stops. For the second course I ordered the lamb chops. These were deliciously cooked but topped with an overly spicy sauce that took away from the excellent cut of meat. These overly sauced dishes proved to be a pattern in this restaurant when a member of my family ordered uni with scrambled eggs and it arrived as beautiful uni surrounded in an unidentifiable brown sauce. Besides for these out-there sauces the dinner was delicious and a great pleasure to eat
5
We're so glad that Coriander Leaf has reopened in a beautifully designed and lively space in Chijmes. The decor is sleek, the open kitchen revealing clever techniques and recipes at work, and the expanded menu is surprising in its range from Mediterranean to Korean. This is not "fusion" - it's a fresh take on top national dishes. Overall a must eat in the heart of Singapore
5
What an amazing meal I had a Coriander Leaf. The staff were attentive and friendly. The open kitchen gives the restaurant a real modern feel as well as it making it interesting for the customers. Highlight of my meal was the soft shell crab (it was so tasty we ordered another one) and the Harissa marinated lamb cutlets. Naan bread is a must as its straight out of the tandoor oven! A very impressive space and love the new look! The only regret I have is going at the end of my trip. If I had gone at the start I would of been back to try more!! Next trip, a cooking class is on the cards
5
I've always loved Coriander Leaf and it is even more exciting in the new venue and format. Many of my favorite dishes are back but in small plate format - thai flavored crisp crabcakes with tomato chutney of all things, a beef kebab which is a refined version of the persian kobeda, a to-die-for frontier chicken with youghurt and red chili from north pakistan - an incredible new dishes - a really intriguing coriander and squid salad of chinese origin, a grilled eggplant and chickpeas from turkey that is warm and soul satisfying, deeply flavorful cuts of black angus with indonesian spicing, a succulent korean beef brisket with split open chinese buns. Really great range of food, all very satisfying
5
Delighted to see the reopening of Coriander Leaf, this time at Chijmes. A reenergised menu (with some of the "favourites" still being served), an interesting Asian themed setting (loved the motifs and artwork) and an interesting wine, sake and umeshu list (the first restaurant serving this i think!). A must visit
5
I just did an AMAZING 'Thai Memories' cookery course with some friends at the newly reopened Coriander Leaf (which moved from Clarke Quay to Chijmes). SO happy they reopened before I relocate back to Blighty later this summer! Chef and restaurant founder, Samia Ahad, is hugely entertaining, incredibly relaxed - and supported by the equally fun and friendly Vivian Pei, who will be running a lot of the courses going forward. Rather than being a hands on cooking course, which would be chaos and not very productive, we sat at the kitchen counter, watching the culinary magic before us as Samia and Vivien whipped up 8 unbelievably DELICIOUS Thai dishes. We tasted the food as it was prepared, learnt loads of extra tips and recommendations that we could write down in the fab Coriander Leaf recipe books, were served coffees and fresh water non stop - and then we got to sit down to lunch. There were 8 of us - but enough food to feed 16!!! I got to take some home for my hubby - who was really wowed! We learnt to cook - and then eat - Tom Ka Gai, Thai Beef Salad, Larb Gai, Steamed Sea Bass with Lime & Chilli, Kra Prow Gai, Pad Thai, Eggplants in Sweet & Sour Chilli Sauce and Mangoes with a Chilli and Lime Freeze. Can't wait to try these recipes out for my husband and friends. Will DEFINITELY be booking a few dinners there (including this weekend) and some more cookery courses before I leave Singapore. Thanks so much Samia, Vivien and all your Coriandar Leaf colleagues! Best cookery course EVER! And great value for money. Learnt and ate so much
5
My family visited Coriander Leaf on a family trip to SE Asia, and had our best meal of the year (so far)! We loved the small-plate format which allowed us to sample and share a variety of dishes. Favorites were the tandoori chicken, braised beef briskets, bbq ray fin, and soft shell crab. Everything that we put in our mouth was delicious, and service was helpful and attentive. Atmosphere was great-- indirect dim lighting, lively but not too noisy to hear. If you are in Singapore don't miss it
5
If you are a food lover, like to venture in food tasting, like to eat every bit of every dish, this is the restaurant you will definitely fall in love with! The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy, classy & elegant! Most importantly, the foods are FANTASTIC! Small portion @affordable price! Highly recommended the Charcoal Grilled Baby Lamb chops – the taste is FABULOUS!! Homemade XO sauce in silken tofu, poached egg , crispy chicken skin is aN unique dish – that’s a MUST TRY! and many more! I am to go again next month for friend celebration! A place you will want to go again and again and again ........ Oh, ONE more great point you must know! If you are an organizer for Corporate Bonding/Networking, you may want to check them out! They offer cooking classes and you will be amazed by the Chef - Chef Samia! A friendly and lovely lady chef I have ever met
5
We had a truly remarkable meal here one evening. A friend and I enjoyed the Burrimundi expertly prepared with several glasses of lovely Australian chardonnay. The service was superb. I will make a point of dining here when next in Singapore.
4
Very attentive service,excellent flat bread with the hummus,the chick pea and lentil soup is really delicious.Price is reasonable though towards the high side.
5
Had the chance to sample the menu...and couldn't stop eating... The lamb chops, venus clams, chicken, the cool dumplings, and the quail-egg salted soft shell crab, and lava cake are spectacular.They have a great selection of approachable sake and awesome craft spirits, like a boutique India rum, and a new gin label... Well worth being a little adventurous on the drinks and the food. It will pay dividends.If you feel like getting amongst it..its worth getting a seat at the bar to watch the kitchen which is right in front of you
4
In this restaurant you will find a really nice atmosphere, it is nicely furnished and, if going for dinner, the lights are dimmed.Also the background music is pleasant and not invasive.Tables close to the windows have a nice view on the quay.All the staff is kind and welcoming, and the food is great: we had a platter of Asian appetizers, two main courses and two desserts, accompanied by beer.Dishes were well presented and portions were adequate, everything was delicious.The only drawback is the "polar" temperature inside the room, it is quite difficult for an european person to fully enjoy food while freezing.Not cheap but worth it
5
winding down on our way back from 4 weeks in Italy we decided to break the trip and adjust the body clock back to a closer time zone to Oz.We were recommended to Indochine where we ate the night before, corporate, overly expensive and not great value at all. Apparently it is closing down as part of the Museum refurb.So some Tripadvisor research and off we went to Coriander Leaf.A little difficult to find and upstairs, which initially we were concerned about as no view of the water!!BUT our reservations were quickly allayed.This is an outstanding restaurant with great service and the food was fresh, presented beautifully and excellent eating.One criticism is that it looks a little tired with marked walls and chipped furniture but in the scale of things only a minor point.Word of warning for wine lovers when in Singapore..........drink water as the prices are outrageous for wine, the cheapest bottle was $70 Singapore or around $60 Oz and the average near $110. Albeit Indochine was at least 20% dearer again.Highly recommend that you seek out Coriander Leaf for an excellent meal
4
My wife and I dined there on a Monday night. 7 pm booking and when we arrived not a soul in the place. So we were a bit nervous but were placed by the window and had a great view of the river. Kamal soon had us relaxed and carried a good conversation. The choice of wine and the quality of food was very good and Kamal went out of his way to make us feel welcome (even offering different types of wines to try) so it was service over and above. Eventually other tables were occupied but if you want a break from the "run of the mill" restaurants on water at Clarke and Boat keys then would recommend Coriander leaf
4
Fantastic experience eating in this restaurant!We had Asean tasting plate for two to start with and were blown away but the quality of the food. The size was just right for two as well.Drinks were on the little pricey side but comparable with other places in Clarke Quay. The old favourite Singapore Sling was well received by my partner.Mains were delicious and again a great serving size.We also had the dessert tasting plate and were left slightly underwhelmed but again very nice.Could not fault the service at all. Our waiter was very attentive and very good at his job.Would definitely go back without hesitation
4
We had a nice quiet room for a group of 14. The set 3 course menu was very good, and did not leave me wishing for the full menu. The appetizer was 3 different Asean items, all delicious. I chose the Za'atar crusted lamb, also very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Dessert was Muhalabiah. The meal was so good, I tried to go back on Sunday evening but they are closed on Sundays, pity
4
We had a very pleasant dinner at Coriander Leaf. The Mezze appetizer platter was absolutely delicious - maybe the best part of the meal. Highlights were the great hummus and pita, amazing red pepper dip, and yummy cheese balls. My entree was the coriander-miso cod, which was perfectly cooked and nicely flavored. We shared the "chocolate hot pot" dessert, which as other reviews have stated is way too small (though good). Service was excellent; overall a nice respite from the rest of Clarke Quay. However, I thought for the quality and portion sizes it was overpriced
4
In my view, Coriander Leaf is definitely the best restaurant on the Clark Quay strip and one of the better restaurants in Singapore. It seems to target primarily tourists, and therefore somewhat under the radar amongst the expat crowd here. I've come to Coriander Leaf 3 times for dinner, all of which have been consistently enjoyable. They do the fusion concept well, although their dishes are skewed towards the Indian side. They do a very good coriander miso cod. The service has always been attentive. The interior is simple but tasteful. If I had to be critical I would say that there is room to amp up the portion size for some of their appetizers and their chocolate fondant. Rather paltry for the price, I would say. Coriander Leaf is the perfect place to take out of town guests but a nice option for any occasion. Next time I would like to come and try a cooking class
4
Coriander Leaf makes seriously excellent meals in an unpretentious environment. It is a fairly quiet place and the servers are very helpful and friendly. It is obvious that the chef works hard to create dishes he can be proud of.
5
I recently had the opportunity to attend a corporate bonding at Coriander leaf and it was nothing short of spectacular. All staff were extremely helpful and attentive and I would highly recommend this venue for a cooking activity that was a fantastic experience.
4
Not terribly expensive, but absolutly wonderful cuisine. appetizers cost 8-12 SGD, main courses 35-45 SGD. A group of 6 tourists, we all enjoyed a various meals. After trying a numbers of restaurants at Clark Quay, this is tops the lot so far.
5
My husband & I had recently held our wedding dinner in Coriander Leaf. We have had a wonderful evening there, with great foods, lovely table settings & the staff was very helpful and professional. Big thank to Sherwin Sim for all his helps in making our dinner such a wonderful & memorable one. With his best recommendations the food menu and all the useful suggestions the night was a complete success. Also thanks to Ah Too, Justin, Kamal, Adrian & all the staffs who had helped in our wedding night making it such a romantic evening not just for us but all of our guests as well. Our guests enjoyed the dinner very much and has given many wonderful compliments on our special night. Many thanks to a job well done by the Coriander Leaf team.Excellent place and a must try restaurant with reasonably price menu!
4
We had planned seafood at Jumbo but the place was heaving and we were rather rudely turned away as we hadn't booked (it was only 7.30) with the suggestion that we try after 9.30....first come first served! Not very user friendly . What a pleasure to try Coriander Leaf on the other side of the river. The reception we had was exceptional l...professional and courteous. We were given a table and then moved to a better spot when a nicer table became available. The service and staff were fantastic, the food Asian with western alternatives ....wonderful flavours....we had crab cakes/Vietnamese prawn rolls and lamb kebabs. Great setting for couples or small groups but wouldn't suggest for children. Whole experience was high quality and great value
5
We enjoyed a memorable evening courtesy of Kamal and his colleagues. The food was super with delightful flavours and we found the portions more than adequate. The wine list is good and Kamal provided some excellent recommendations. We thought the cost was very reasonable for a leading restaurant in a major and expensive city
3
It was a great welcome, a good view, and a very tasty meal but I got the distinct impression the chef was running out of some ingredients. For example the tabouleh was mainly chopped tomato and hardly any bulgur wheat which was a bit odd. The fish dish had two pieces of what looked like fish but one of the pieces turned out to be potato. And the ice cream was one boule - which would normally be ok for me but it was only a very small scoop - the size of a quail's egg rather than a golf ball
4
Excellent service, excellent food, unusual menu. I am a fan of fusion, it was really excellent. We enjoyed very much and this is our Third time back. Chicken Tandori and Butter/garlic naan were all fantastic, cooked to perfection. Great place, overlooking Singapore river! But the price is NOT cheap!!

OK, before I start, let me just describe myself and my expectations. I'm a big man with a big appetite and a love of good food. I cook a lot, every type of cuisine, and I know what is good and not good.I don't like pretentious, and do try to avoid pretentious places, however I picked this place initially for my wife's birthday dinner as a special treat on our visit to Singapore, only to find it was closed on Sunday, her birthday, so we did Monday instead.I can't comment on atmosphere as we thankfully got placed in a side room with another set if diners while what I presume was a Xmas party was going on in the main area. Singaporeans certainaly know how to make noise!My wife and I had our 2 daughters ( 7 and 8) with us, and to be very fair to the staff, and the staff was excellent, no problems there whatsoever, they treated the girls well with a free fruit drink and sweet naan bread for them...a nice touch and much appreciated so onto the food:Starters, crab cakes. 4 crab cakes the size of a 'tenner marble' with a pretty non-descript chutney, $12. OK, nothing special, I would say the 4 would just about make one normal sized cake. Vietnamese paper rolls...2 cut in 2, each about the size of my thumb, $8. Peanut sauce apparently. OK, I mean just OK. On a positive my wife had a very small miso soup $8, which she reckons was the best she has ever tasted.Mains: I had lamb kebab $35. OK, probably a small starter. The girls shared ginger butter prawns $34, probably about 6 smallish prawns. The best part was the baby tomatoes. My wife had the Angus ribeye @ $40. It was the size of a wagon wheel ( for those of you who remember them), or about the size of a roll of tape, with a lot of fat. It did taste quite nice. The extra bits and pieces were what I would call 'somewhat hatstand'...basically irrelevant and, well, why? is the question. The naan was good.The chocolate hot pot, $15, come on, there wasn't even a desert spoonful there, it was tasty, but honestly, come on!Like I said, staff was attentive, I knocked down a jug of Tiger and my wife had a Mojito, but still $240 and we had to get a Burger King afterwards!For those who don't mind paying stupid money for what I can only describe as the old Nouvelle Cuisine, then go for it, you'll not be disappointed spending money on nothing. For those who want to eat, perhaps think of an alternative
4
We went to this restaurant for a team building activity, wherein we had to cook the food and then eat it. The staff was very cooperative and helped us in preparing the food. When we finished we were amazed to see what all we had prepared. The staff then added on some dishes from their end and we had a great time:)A very nice place to plan such events
5
Walked in without reservation, but was offered space at counter, which was a great place to watch all that was going on, but were still able to enjoy the delicious food that was prepared for us.
5
What an amazing restaurant. An oasis of calm in the bussle of Clarke Quay. Beautifully decorated!! The reception was warm and welcoming, the maitre d' looking after us were absolutely superb, food was excellent and portion sizes really good. It is really highly recommended.
4
Good place, pleasant and good food. We had a set dinner and it was quiet sufficient & desserts were yummy. Lots of variety of sea food, chicken !
4
Very enjoyable evening at coriander leaf, thoroughly enjoyed the various appetizers the shish kebabs, and the fish cakes, the prawns were great., quite reasonable and lovely ambience away from the crowds of Clark quay.
5
Excellent service, excellent food, unusual menu. I am not a fan of fusion food but make no mistake here, it was really excellent. We enjoyed very much and we will come back. Mezze platter , Chicken Tandori and Lamb chops were all first class, cooked to perfection. Great place
5
We had difficulty finding the restaurant but were pleased that we were able to find it. The host was very helpful and explained the menu and the cooking classes.The food was tasty and well presented. There was a buzz to the place because of the corporate cooking classes being conducted in the kitchen
4
Coriander serves really tasty food. We visited it twice during our stay in Singapore and loved it both times. The food just seemed to get better and the ambiance was nice. The presentation of the food was impeccable and so were the server’s manners, very polite and friendly. We had steak (tender and juicy and rightly done). This restaurant demands a visit
4
Really good meal. We had been committed to only eating in hawker food courts but on our last night decided to hang out at Clark's quay. Fun place to walk around in the evening. The coriander restaurant had excellent fish as well as really delicious sampler plate appetizers
4
This place is simply WOW with food that tantalizes, a view that is a treat for your eyes and an interior with a wonderful ambience. The presentation of the food is quite beautiful and triggers a person to taste it immediately. The steak (as Mains) was really tender and my wife loved it. A special thanks to the manager, Kamal Razak for his hospitality. A highly recommended place for romantic dinners for its stylish decor and unpretentious food
5
A great location in the heart of the Clarke Quay precinct. An interesting mix of styles of food on offer. We mixed the Middle-Eastern, Indian & Asian. The tasting plates are a great way to start, we went with Mezze plate. Great dips & finger foods, very generous with plenty of Pita Bread to enjoy the Harissa dip in particular. My wife chose the Frontier Chicken with the Chilli level reduced from 4 to 2! A wise decision that allowed her to enjoy this unusual main. My coriander crusted duck was cooked to perfection. Both mains came with suitable veges & Pita Bread which helped soak up all those lovely juices & sauces.The light desserts, mixed Creme Brûlée & Muhalabah, were the perfect light way to end the meal.Service throughout was of a high standard with good advice on menu choices & water continually being re-filled.Great food, outstanding service
4
The appetizers were excellent (Asean sampler tray), and we tried a couple of fish dishes.
Both fish mains were very good (Cod with miso and Sea basee with fish molee)
5
We have just returned for Singapore and had the very pleasant experience of enjoying a meal at this restaurant. We arrived early and were waited on extremely quickly, I think every staff member on that night came to attend to us. The meal was served very quickly and was delicious, it was presented beautifully. After reading reviews before we arrived in Singapore we thought we had better try this restaurant and it really lived up to all expectations
5
We never tire of the Coriander Leaf. I recently got together a group of friends for the Vietnamese cookery course - which didn't disappoint. Chef and owner Samia and sous chef Eddy chopped and sizzled their way through three hours of preparation while we sat and watched the culinary magic unfold. While you don't get to cook yourself, even seasoned cooks can pick up new tips and the bonus is you do get to eat everything that's made - usually in excess of six different dishes. Everyone gets given the recipes to go away with so they can recreate the dishes at home. If you're visiting Singapore on holiday or live here and want to try something different I can't recommend this highly enough. There are a host of different classes on weekdays and weekends, every one a delicious journey of discovery
5
We ate here once in the evening and also had drinks at their Lilypad bar which is just outside and allows for a lovely pre-dinner drink on the Singapore river. Organising the table was very easy - I emailed ahead to Justin who was friendly, helpful and flexible when we wanted to make a last minute change. The staff at the bistro on the night were also all helpful and friendly. There were 4 in our party and we all struggled to choose from the menu because there were many things we all wanted to eat! It is unusual for us all to have 3 courses in a restaurant but we couldn't resist and nothing disappointed. Our only regret is that we didn't have time to return
5
It is a must to visit this restaurant as the staff and food is excellent. My sister and I dined and we had rice paper rolls and salt and pepper calamari for entree and for mains I had the steak and my sister had the rack of lamb. Both dishes where delicious and had a lot of flavour. We could not fit dessert in. We will come back to this restaurant
5
I had been to the cookery class and was hugely impressed by Samia the chef whose knowledge of Asian food is encyclopaedic. A few days later my husband and I visited the restaurant and received really excellent service from Kamal Razak the manager. The green papaya salad was fresh, zingy and well-balanced and the Frontier Chicken was one of the best Indian dishes I have ever eaten - and I've eaten plenty. I just cannot find the recipe anywhere - those which appear online under this name bear no resemblance. Anyway, should we find ourselves in Singapore again we would most certainly return. I just wish there was somewhere like this round the corner
5
A recommendation from the hotel we were staying at. Mezze Platter was very interesting, we both chose the duck and this was outstanding, the three creme broullee and the chocolate with honey ice cream were wonderful and we shared these between us. Pity about the English Breakfast Tea coming in a tea ba
4
The restaurant has a pleasant interior and a nice bar outside. The service is friendly. The food is good, especially the mezze platter as starter are delicious. One point is a bit disturbing. The smell of the tandoori is quite intensive, so when you go out the clothes will smell as well
5
I had dinner here with my wife. We ordered middle eastern food, which was excellent. Also the service was very good. We will go back there next time we are in Singapore. This is probably a good place for couples, family and friends, but not so for solo business traveller
5
This is a very nice restaurant. It has a comfortable seating area, very airy and light, a good space between tables, modern and bright. The staff are polite and efficient and prepared to take time to describe each dish. The food is superb and the tandoori sea bass to die for.Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed
4
Food and staff were exceptional. If you're doing a team building event they do a fabulous cooking class for about 12 -15 people. Check it out!
4
Been there with my Customer and Boss. a reasonable place to have meaningful conversation.
They serve fusion cuisine, bar seen is very limited. its good to order wine they have a nice wine selection.
a good place but it will hit heavy on pocket.

Had dinner with 3 friends on 30th October. This is on the riverwalk. This is an outdoor restaurant with the theme of a yacht. The choice of food is limited. The cocktails are bad, avoid them. The restaurant closes ridiculously early @ 10.30 PM.

we had a corporate challenge cook off there. staff was knowledgeable, professional and FUN! decor is so unusual and creative. bar has intricately carved coriander leaves out of the metal front. ceiling tiles are covered in a variety of asian fabrics, even the chairs are interesting!food was delicious. would like to go back again just for a meal outside of a work related event.

Went with my partner on holiday. There was a cooking class on and a birthday function yet they still organized a table for us. Food was nice, my only complaint was the size of the lamb rack. It was reasonable but it definitely left me wanting more. My partner ordered the tandoori chicken and was unable to finish it due to the size of the meal. The wine was nice but options where very limited by the glass. Service was perfect and my partner received a complimentary drink. All up it was around $200.

My husband and I chose Coriander Leaf for a special family evening. We weren't disappointed! The menu is comprised of a wonderful array of Pan Asian dishes. We particularly enjoyed the South Asian and Mezze Sampler Platter appetizers. Our favorite main was Duo of Labeyrie Duck and the Bread Pudding dessert was wonderful as was the Creme Brulee. Service was prompt and unobtrusive. The ambiance in the restaurant was nice, tables are nicely spaced so we didn't feel crowded by other diners and were able to easily carry on conversation among ourselves.All in all it was a lovely evening, I hope to return to Coriander Leaf for dinner again and again.I returned early in January to attend a Cooking Class (Arabian Nights) they offer a wide range of classes. I participate in cooking classes often, this was my first class at Coriander Leaf. I found the chef personable and professional. The class is not hands on but everything was demonstrated clearly, I left full of very good food and armed with all the recipes, some of which I've already tried at home. I'll definitely return to Coriander Leaf for more courses

The hustle and bustle is fun to walk through in Clark Quay and many of the restaurants seemed touristy and lacking in quality, but this restaurant is a great find. They have a nice wine pairing, tasting menu and we enjoyed every course, in both quisine and presentation. It may be a little pricey but it was worth having the experience of Clarke Quay and not having to settle for a touristy spot

We live in Singapore and made a booking online. When we arrived (the first guests) we were shown the worst table in the restaurant (right next to the sliding door of the cooking school entrance where later there was a very busy in and out activity with lots of noise. We were told all other tables are reserved (the restaurant was one third full when we left much later - c'mon guys, whom you kidding!). Some well located tables remained empty! No way there were booked. Service attentive, entree sample platter quality very good, both main course mediocre and reflecting precooking method: the fish smelled and tasted "fishy" (defrosted?), the chicken was very, very dry (precooked?). Unfortunately, the cooking smell became increasingly overwhelming in the restaurant - probably coming from the cooking school, despite the sliding door reclosed. Ah well, not worth our visit again

I was invited to a baby bath with to mothers-to-be and about 20 people in total. The experience was great. We got the freshest vegetables and the finest meat to cook with. Each team of ten had to prepare 4 dishes. The supervision was great and the food turned out to be delicious. The fun-level was high and the stomach happy. βραφο μασ!!

Whatever your food interest is, you can accomplish it at Coriander Leaf....from cooking classes to corporate team-building to sampling Asian culinary delights, they do it all. Service was executed properly and our waiter was attentive throughout the entire meal. Even though the restaurant was holding several corporate events the night we had reservations, the wait staff did not miss a beat for a table of 3. This was the first local restaurant that I have been to that didn't feel like the frozen food section of a grocery store. The temperature was just right.Our spicy calamari and chickpea appetizers were lightly fried and cooked completely. I had a vegetarian dish for my entree consisting of an eggplant tagliatelle pasta. The zesty chutney spices enhanced my pasta that give it a real sense of taste. There is a wide selection of meat, fish and poultry options which looked appealing as the wait staff brought food to other tables. I wish I had known before I left that Coriander Leaf's home-made chutney and fresh condiments were available for purchase. That would have been a great foodie souvenir to take back to the states

We try to eat here every time we are in Singapore. It is yet to disappoint. Pan Asia food done with care. Good wine list. Not cheap but its a treat. In Clark Quay but really out of place for the Clark Quay crowd
1
We have started by trying to order wine. The first 4 wines (and the wine list is not extensive) were not in stock. By the time the waiter came back to tell us about the fact that he could not find the 5 th wine (after searching for it for 10 minutes) a half an hour has gone by and we still had no food (in fact no one took our order), no wine (the only ones that were "recommended" by the waiter were not drinakable), just a glass of water to keep us company. We walked out before trying our luck in ordering something. Either the restaurant does not invest in staff (too few), wine cellar (nothing is available) or they prefer to do cooking classes for expats. Either way, we will not come back
4
Pros - Tasty food, nicely decorated, attentive serviceCons - FREEZING cold, overpriced, spotty execution, inconsistent serviceThey made a few mistakes with our order but attempted to correct them. Really enjoyed the mezze platter. Khao Suey noodles were good, if not exactly authentic (I had this dish in northeast Thailand, where it originates), but way overpriced
4
I love everything about this restaurant and think the food is some of the best I have tasted. However, as with so many indoor places in Singapore, it was far too cold. By the end of the evening I was so cold and couldn't wait to leave to go outside and warm up. Something they should look at getting fixed

We had 2 great platters of mixed appetizers "south east asian" and the quality of the food was great. The fusion of tastes is really interesting and makes you even discover new flavors and tastes. The main dishes also give you the opportunity of experiencing traditional tastes of Asia but revisited in modern key. There is a great attention on the choice of raw materials, I think, and even a single grilled tomato is really tasty. Service also is very good. The reason why I think it's a very good restaurant but not excellent is that, from my point of view, alcohol is really overpriced (you pay 18 dollars plus 10% of service and 7% of taxes for a glass of normal wine) and the overall price of dishes is a bit to high (expect to pay more than 100 dollars per person for appetizer, main dish, dessert and 1 glass of wine). Anyway, it tastes great and it's worth to give it at try

We ate here one evening whilst staying on the quay. We sat outside taking in the views of the river. Service was good and enjoyed listening to the live entertainment. Food was presented really well and tasted delicious, would definitely visit again, there is an indoor restaurant but the outside area is great for drinks and nibbles

We ate here based on Trip Advisor reviews. It certainly did not disappoint.. Entree tasting plate was excellent and the mains were very good too. Barramundi better than any we have had in Australia (we eat Aussie fish/seafood regularly) and the tandoori chicken was excellent. The host was very knowledgable about food and wine and had spent time in France so could explain wine and food. Dessert trio of creme brûlée pretty good too and all in all a very good experience. Bonus is that they have a cooking school so we will definitely be back to give that a go next time we are in Singapore. All in all a great experience and thanks Trip Advisor contributors for steering us in the direction of Coriander Leaf

We tried eating at the Coriander Leaf the first time we were in Singapore but it was closed; however, good Trip Adviser reviews convinced us to try again the next time we were in town and we're awfully glad we did. We especially liked the appetizer plates and the lentil, and sour soup.The place was fairly empty so the lag in service was puzzling but since we were on vacation, we didn't mind much

In the midst of all the crazy hubbub that is Clarke Quay, lies this gem of an Indian-fusion restaurant. Not sure if it will survive much longer, given the lack of crowd on a Friday night, but it suited us just fine. There were only 5 tables' worth of customers at any one time, so it really was a lovely place to rest our feet and decompress before heading out for some crazy fun again. The food was beautiful. Not only in presentation, but taste. I ordered ginger butter prawns as my main and it was delish. The butter sauce was creamily delightful and spiced just so - was as fantastic as the butter chicken I had in Delhi a while back. Ginger added a lovely subtle zing to the sauce and complemented the fabulously succulent prawns wonderfully. It was served with steaming hot basmati rice. I wanted more rice just so I could lick the plate clean of the ginger butter gravy. The price was expensive but definitely well worth every cent. Ordered the creme brûlée trio and was blown away by the coffee flavoured one. The orange was a bit like cough syrup and the vanilla was blah. Service was considerate, with our water being topped up constantly. Definitely heading back to be wowed by the rest of the menu

no taste, no style, no charmI am wondering why they got so many prices and good reviews.Maybe the chef left and the crew who cleans the place - most of all the windows.Tasteless food at its best and if you sit next to the windows you feel like watching a dirtyaquarium.Have fun
4
This is very inventive restaurant where the best tastes of Asia are brought together in a unique way. Not the cheapest restaurant on Clarke Quay but certainly a place to bring out the best in your taste buds.

Best restaurant i've eaten in for years. Great food and excellent service. Accommodated dietary requirements (coeliac) really well. Highly recommended.

Great restaurant with original dishes. Basically a mixture of Eastrn and Middle-Eastern cuisine. Some dishes are slightly spicy, but worth to try

This was our first visit to a Singapore restaurant this trip, we were guided by other reviews, the restaurant is upstairs in a block just off Clarke Quay, we were a little of course by first finding River Valley Road which is given as an address rather than just the quay which would have been more straight forward. The room we were shown too was rather quiet although more people did turn up, the main focus of the business seems to be large corporate "cooking class" parties. Our meal was fine with one or two really excellent dishes, so overall a fine restaurant. One small niggle the wash-rooms were extremely scruffy, both for Singapore and the type of corporate custom they appeared to cater for
4
I have had dinner there and had a great time. Even though I was on my own, I really enjoyed my meal, the fish was tasteful and perfectly cooked. They have arranged for some greens instead of rice (can't anymore...) without any problem. The wine was also delicious. True that it is a little pricey compared to other places around but it worths it

We ate here as part of a three hour cooking class, and really enjoyed it. When we were planning our trip to Singapore, we had decided learning to cook some Asian inspired food would be good fun, but we struggled to find places that did classes. I initially was reluctant to sign up at the Coriander Leaf, since the class was a demonstration, and I would generally have preferred hands on, but as it turned out, it was not a problem.The head chef did the demo, and she was fantastic. Did a great job explaining each step of preparing the dishes (she cooked 7 things), and also spent plenty of time talking about how to use Asian spices etc. I learnt a lot. I also liked her assistant, who was very funny, and also gave some of his input which was great, since he was a Singaporean, whereas the head chef is Indian (though she has lived around the world), so we got a different slant on things.After the demo, we sat down as a group to eat the food, and it was stellar. I would have liked to eat in the restaurant following this, but was unable to find a time to suit

Beef steak was perfect as well as lamb rack. Although it's a bit pricey, but the food and service is very good. The only downside is the conditioner. It was very cold inside and they could not do it any warmer. They offered some scarves for our kids, but it feels uncomfortable to sit with the scarf inside when it is +30 outside.
5
I've been to Coriander Leaf twice in the last couple of years. Both times, the visit did not disappoint. The food is quite uinque and is Asian fusian cuisine with heavy Indian influence. Great place for private events with good service and decent ambience. Rght along the Clarke Quay river which makes it perfect for tourists. Good for entertainiing corporate visitors as well.Not cheap but if you want a memorable experience in terms of innovative flavours, try this place

Whenever we go to Singapore we pay a visit.. We went twice in September and remain impressed, and this is after 4 years of visits!The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet-unlike the rest of the city. No hype, just trainees trying to do their best serving delicious food.View out to Clarke Quay is a solid distraction, watching the bum boats and strange model aircraft in the park over the river at night.Have never had a bad dish and the lightest nan bread on the planet

Although we went there on a Monday night for dinner, it was quite busy. We sat at a table by the huge window, which gave us a great view of the river. Our server was super attentive. The menu is a mish mash of Indian, Thai, Vietnamese and Middle Eastern. Food was excellent and well presented in decent sized portions. We had smoked duck with mango and pomelo salad and the calamari to start. Both appetizers were well balanced in taste. For mains we had lamb rack and tandoori chicken. The rack was perfectly pink in the middle and I must say, I have never tasted such tender and juicy chicken tandoori. The butter naan that came with it was thin and moorish, unlike the usual stodgy doughy flatbread. We washed all that down with a bottle of South African red and the total bill came to SGD200
