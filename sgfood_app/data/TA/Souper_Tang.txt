Very hearty meals and soups but undeniably, their standard has dropped quite dramatically. Service was decent too.

Rainy days are aplenty during the monsoon season and at its peak, itâ€™s always comforting to have a bowl of steaming herbal soup! Personal favourite is the herbal black chicken soup!

My family of 7 enjoyed the food. My favourite would be the braised pork belly and ginger chicken. Tender and savoury. I also love the refreshing osathemum tea. Very light and not too sweet.
3
Everything was very average and the price point is also nothing fantastic. Service was pretty good though

First tried Souper Tang in JB, though it's a little more expensive to have it in Singapore due to the exchange rate but the food and service made up for it.
4
The food is freshly prepared and served while hot.
Per dish is more than enough for 4 pax.
Customer services is attentive

because chope had promo with 10%, took the chance to try since didnt tried in msia before. staffs were friendly, however the food was slight disappointing. the herbal soup with pork was quite turned off with the pork taste super porky. i unable to swallow and my friend took over and agreed was very strong porky taste. ordered fish with olive and panfried eggplants. both tasted ok but didnt expect that to come both in deep soupy gravy. the male and female staffs once again i would like to compliment their friendliness.

I was attracted by the name of this restaurant of Souper Tang (Super soup in Chinese), and presumed the soup was of superior quality. However, after the tasting, I would like to say that the soup was mediocre, can't even compared to many stalls selling similar types of soup in many hawker centers in Singapore at much lower prices

Enjoyed their signature soup. The portions are generous, and a small bowl was enough for 3 persons. The braised pork belly could have been a little more tender though. Last but not least, the caramel bean curd dessert was silky smooth and received thumbs up from everyone

It was first visit for my friend and I and we both was expectating decent quality since the theme of restaurant is about healthy and nutritious food. It was disappointing as the sea cucumber soup was starchy, the signature fried beancurd & beancurd strips was so hard and bearly absorbed the sauce. The appetizer which was seasoned guava tasted bland. The ones I made at home taste so much better. The wine vermicelli with chicken and fried french bean were nothing special.
4
Their soups and appetisers are worth a try. Good tasting at a reasonable price. For dessert, one can consider their bean curd.

good tasty soups with thick broths, will be back again! except that it is open concept so not so much privacy
3
Foods not that fantastic and prices are slightly steep.
Not really value for money.
Service staffs are friendly.
5
Great healthy food & service. Food taste good and comes in generous portion. The staff are friendly and service is excellent too.

There is nothing to shout about regarding the food here, unlike much of the instagramable offers that increasingly proliferate. But that is just the beauty of this eatery - it's just plain homely comfort food from warm nutritious soups to simple dishes to go with rice. Then it all gets washed down with equally soothing desserts. Before you leave, check out the soup and tea packs near the payment counter where you could pick up some ready-to-boil goodness

We had lunch in this restaurant after some lengthy consideration as the restaurants around here were very busy whereas this one was only about 15% occupied..We ordered only 3 dishes. The drunken chicken with ginger paste dipping, chicken with rice wine soup and the pork belly slices (forgot all the names on the menu).The chicken rice wine soup was excellent.. Drunken chicken was not bad but the pork belly was just plain...It was pricy compared to many of the restaurants here.Not really a place I would come back.

Love the abalone sauce mee suah, simple yet very flavorful. The black chicken soup is nice.. other soups were not as nice as expected and pricing is on the high side. However, the service is good and there are many soups I have yet to try. So I am sure to be back again!

As it was weekend dining, the usual weekday set lunch offers were not available. The abalone rice was tasty. It is also good that Souper Tang have taken in previous feedback to include a bit more veg in the soup for fibre content. At the end of the meal, I felt very thirsty and asked if I could have a glass of plain water. The reply: We charge for plain water. Hmmm, they whacked $2 for service charge for this lunch and they are so churlish over a glass of water when it is NOT a set lunch order? C'mmon, man.

This was our first time here and we were very excited looking at some of the dishes shown on the menu as they looked both delicious and nutritious. We ordered the fish maw and pepper pig tripe soup. Both dishes tasted flat and lacked depth of flavour. We concluded that even the pig tripe soups served at food courts or zi chars tasted much better. It was a very disappointing experience especially for the prices charged here. The service here also could be improved. We were not given any wet towels on our table but when we declined to pay for wet towels at the cashier because we hadn't used any, the cashier actually asked us to return the wet towels before they would remove it from the bill

Family went there for a birthday lunch for one of my daughters. We had a variety of dishes. They were mostly 'health' centrix and also soup base.I find Singapore eateries generally do not offer free wifi as is so common in many countries in the region. Must be telcos monopoly
3
Overall atmosphere and quality was good but pricey. Ordered 1 soup for sharing, 2 mains, 1 veg and a jug of drink. Total bill $90.
4
Mee Sua is much more palatable than the Rice option. Also, the restaurant has improved in adding some veg to the soup - this was my adverse finding previously.
3
The food is good, but it is less good, less varied, and more expensive than at The Soup Restaurant. More pricey items, like Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. The set lunch is good value, at $9.90 ++. Friendly service.
4
Good but a bit pricey. The food quality is not exactly the same as the city sq branch in jb.. Close tho. Price definitely more ex than jb
3
The restuarant is very crowded, takes sometime for the waiter to attend to us. The soup tend to be on the salty side. Probably would need more adjustments. Have nice dishes on the menu, look forward for the company to expand the soup choices.
4
Very tasty soup, full of flavour and goodness. Good variety of soups to try. Would definitely go again and try out different ones each time.
4
a lot of soup selection.. but wasn't really up to my expectation.. selection of the rest of the food quite limited.
3
Was told by waitress that the set lunch price (lower than a la carte menu price) does NOT result in smaller portion. That being the case, the portion is really too small for lunch - bearing in mind that the mini hot stone pot used for serving would result in 15% of the rice being stuck to the pot base at the end of the meal.

It was a nice gem that I discovered after impatient with the long queue for a famous restaurant next to it. I like the signature soup, cod fish and hot plate pork. So far, I also found out that this is their first foray into Singapore food market as it is originated in Malaysia. You want a unique chinese cuisine in Centre Point, try this and I bet you will like it better than famous xiao long bao restaurant next door.
3
Nice food presentation and there are many soup and food choices. Since it's famous for its soup, I would expect more from the soup choices. We ordered NingShen Remedying and it's SpareRib Soup with Cordysep. We were pretty disappointed with the little ingredients within both. Can give this place a try but I won't purposely visit again just for it's soup
