Really didn't like the place. Burgers were pretty small and quiet unappetising. Probably shouldn't have expected all that much from such a restaurant though. Just more of the same where fast food comes in.

This is a fast food joint.
However, their burgers are better than M and B.
Can try if you are around..

Not the best burger joint to fix your burger craving. Skip it if you can. The burgers are not the freshest and the meat is not the healthiest.

So close to Marina Mandarin and a very convenient place to grab some quick energy when youre running around town and had to make a quick stop at the hotel. Staff are friendly

We spent several hours in Carl's Junior Bar, both drinking beers and eating. The staff were terrifically helpful, and altogether we had a great time, and not costly, at these premises which form part of Singapore's vast Suntek City shopping mall.

This was my first visit to a Carl's Jr store. Had an amazing western Bacon burger. Juicy and well made patty in a soft bun. Just the thing to have when hunger strikes.

The restaurant's location is ok, it is neither terrific nor terrible. The food is ok, good enough for a fast-food restaurant as well as the service. It is not the best restaurant in Singapore, but it is not bad. I'd recommend it for a quick meal

Since I don't have a big appetite and was just looking for a Western fix , just ordered the Famous Star combo . But the party was really thin , and they just made the burger look bigger. Go for the thick cut ones , the Western bacon seem to be more popular . The huge serving of the crispy fries and the refillable drinks somehow made it a good value for money .

The staff here are nice and the restaurant area clean but other things not so good.The price is a put off. Two large fries and a milkshake is $13.30.Two of us can have burgers, fries and drinks each at other fast food places for $3 more.Then the fries are tasteless and had no salt or pepper.We had to ask staff for salt and pepper as it is not where the sauces are kept.Then the sauce or ketchup was tasteless.We decided not to come back here again as there is so many other fast food places near by that are more reliable

I used to like this Carl's Jr for a quick lunch burger when it first opened but recently it has only been disappointing. One time they had only chicken and no beef. They changed the ketchup to some tasteless version. I won't go back. Too many other tasty choices in Singapore..
