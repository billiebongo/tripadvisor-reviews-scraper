Went therewith friends and the food was really tasty. best to get there early... say by 7pm as the queue started to develop at 7.40pm

Very reasonable price, great service and yummy vietnamese dishes 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Come early so you can get table fast or wait atleast 30 mins to get seated 😊

Service is terrible and food overrated. The pho has no depth of flavor whatsoever. Meals come at random which is not great when dining as a group.

I'm vnese. Grilled shirmp with salt and chilli is mostly perfect, high-recommended ;). Reasonable price 👍🏻

Great variety of food and great services. CASH ONLY!
We been here 4x and tried many dishes here. They all tasted great especially the rice plates and crepes or bang xeo!

This is one of my go-to places in Singapore whenever I want a fix of vietnamese food. It's conveniently located along the main road, so you won't miss it when you follow the maps to come to Grandlink Square. The service is good as they have quite a number of waitresses who are very attentive to the customers - I seldom have to wait for more than a minute to get their attention (even during peak periods).I have tried a couple of dishes here and they are all pretty decent! Compare this to those franchise outlets (e.g. So Pho, Nam Nam), this wins them hands down and what's more, it's much cheaper. Here are some of the dishes that I personally like:- Cockles (with garlic)- Com dui ga (fried chicken with yellow rice)- Pho (standard pho -> it's alright but I have eaten a better one elsewhere)- Banh xeo (traditional vietnamese pancake)- Bún bò Huế (beef and rice vermicelli)And of course, you must order the vietnamese drip coffee! 'This is one of the few places in Singapore where you find more of the locals (i.e. Vietnamese) dining at compared to Singaporeans; This definitely tells you something about the place

Considering there aren’t that many Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore, Little Vietnam is pretty good. It’s a casual place. The prices are reasonable. Remember though they accept cash only and the waiting staff could barely speak English. So even asking for extra vegetables or asking for drink without ice and sugar can go wrong. Any way that does not preventing me from going back there.

The vicinity has been cleaned up, with more lights and space. Wait staff a lot friendlier than before, and food still as tasty and as close to the real deal in Vietnam, though if you are a regular to the city of beep beep you will find that the pho dishes were being tweaked to suit the increasing foreign expats visiting the restaurant.Could see this place as a mini Clarke Quay/Boat Quay, with the dark and sleazy back-then "canal side" being cleaned up and revamped totally with a full row of eating places being installed. The only thing the rest of the places lack is patrons.Will certainly return when I miss phos and Vietnamese paper rolls.... thumbs up

This is a very popular and busy joint where many folk come for a quick, cheap and tasty feed (or to take away). Nothing wrong with that. A lot of the food is pretty much ready to serve or speedy to cook but one or two dishes such as the grilled prawns take a little longer. You'd better like chicken and/or pork though as they feature in a big way in much of the cooking. The rice is good (including the seafood version), the kang kong delicious, the shredded green mango a little less so but still toothsome, the white clams excellent and the grilled prawns slightly dry but delicious. I'm told the pho is very good. There is a range of soft drinks and beers (not quite cold enough for me) but no wine. Seating can be inside or out overlooking the road. Service is attentive and quick. Toilets are outside in the mall but there is a sink in the restaurant where you can rinse your hands which can get a little sticky. The paper napkins, which you may need to request, are dry not wet wipes

I enjoy this restaurant for dinner either with friends or family. The quails dish is a delight. The pho is good quality. I always enjoy a nice fresh coconut at start ...
Last, definitely great value for money 😀
5
First time here and what great value. Wonderful flavours in well cooked tasty food. Service a bit chaotic which adds to the atmosphere. Very popular hence the queue outside but well worth the wait.
4
Excellent and typical vietnamese food with nice terrasse outdoor.
Good quality of ingredient and fresh. Authentic vietnamese meals and pho at affordable price. Recommended!
4
The food is quite nice and the best is fried quail. A must have dish every time I went to this place. Other dishes is good and the price is ok
4
Enjoyed a nice evening out, want not to hot so sat outside. Enjoyed my meal very very much..... look for good taste and look no further.

Healthy and tasty Vietnamese food with great value. No GST and No Service charge.Enjoy outdoor dining environment.Recently Little Vietnam did the renovation. Like to order spring rolls,lemongrass chicken and fresh passion fruit juice.

Open by Vietnamese serving authentic Vietnamese food. Had the Pho Ga (Chicken Noodles) and Tra Da (Vietnamese Hot Tea)

Used to be my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Gone completely taste less , bad service , food took forever to be served , ordered pineapple juices to be told 20 min they were out. Did not even offer a replacement, charged 3 dollars for two leaves of salad to go with the nems when the picture on the menu clearly showed salad with them on and on and on... will not return !!
4
I discovered this place while cruising around Clarke Quay. The live music is what drew me in. They had a great 4 piece band playing. So I stayed had a few beers and a plate of food.....which was delicious. A great way to spend some time of an evening just chilling out

I am an aficionado of authentic Vietnamese food, which I consider to be one of the best cuisines in the word. I travel and work often in Vietnam and always miss authentic Vietnamese food when I return to Singapore. Little Vietnam Restaurant and Cafe at Grandlink Square provides an authentic indoor or outdoor dining experience, as if you are in Vietnam. The decor includes pictures and lanterns of Vietnam and the menu selections are varied and prepared as they are in Vietnam.The service is efficient and friendly and you do not feel as if you are in Singapore during your visit.This is an ideal choice for dining with friends, colleagues and family members, especially when you are looking for an outdoor dining experience
4
It is a nice Vietnamese restaurant- good value for money. Portions are generous and the prices are not that high. Service is ok - We had spring rolls with noodles and they were super delicious!
4
The food here is quite ok, not very authentic and outstanding like Long Phung, but price is reasonable and nearer to MRT. Service is ok. Cash only.
5
Cheap and great food. The line is always long at dinner so make sure you arrive early. A bit annoying because they will only let you drink beer inside.
4
Vietnam food in the heart of Singapore. It's really really great food have been here many times and it's good and very reasonable.
4
Good food, probably the best Vietnamese restaurant in Singapore. Service is terrible, but I guess that's what it's called "authentic," because it's the same kind of service you'd get in a non-touristy restaurants in Vietnam.
4
Good tasting food & reasonable portions. Long queue & continous flow of patrons. Come with a smile & give a clear food order. If u do gv additional orders subsequently, do expect hiccups as this place operates at full house mostly. Our family will certainly return again to explore more food

As a Vietnamese myself. I came here with several friends to enjoy our native food.But it turn out to be very disappointed to me. The food is so so, but that not a problem because i don't expect an oversea Viet restaurant to be as good as in Vietnam.But what is driving me crazy is the attitude. Very bad service.The waitress all looks disdainful and seem to very busy to serve other customers but us. We ask for bowls but take age to get it and we decided to it by hand instead. LOL.They seem contempt the people come from their own country or they just contempt everyone that just don't look rich to them.Will we ever come back? Meh, of course, no

Food - I had the "BUN THIT XAO", in simple English, Beef with rice. Beef was tender and tasty, sauce was delicious but slightly too little to cover over the hard rice. I like the fac that they cook it with yellow pepper, onions, (those stuff that I can remember). Onions were fresh and juicy.Drink - I had RAU MA DAU XANH cos I was feeling adventurous and the table beside mine, was drinking it. It was interesting to drink, grass like flavor with a hint of something like caramel to sweeten it. erm. I will try other drinks though. LOLService - Indifferent is the most apt word that I can think of. If you want quick prompt service, this place is definitely not the place for you. Took some time to get a waitress to order. Saw that other people had trouble getting the bill and went directly to the cashier.Cost for both- less than $10
4
Such a good place for people who love Vietnamese foods, especially for Vietnamese working and studying in Singapore. Whenever I miss my home flavor, I would make a visit to Little Viet nam. The menu here is quite plentiful, but i would recommend for more dishes from the Central part of Vietnam (Cao Lau, Mi Quang, Bun Mam). The price is reasonable and the service is fast, so even with a long queue, guests will get their seats soon.
4
Don't expect to get good customer service here! They are quite busy during the dinner time but their waitresses are really quick! I enjoyed the glass noodles with chicken pho and the iced dripped coffee is really good! Not as strong as the ones you get in Vietnam but there is still the very distinct Vietnam styled coffee you can hardly find in other parts of SG. The Vietnamese pancake is good too.They serve Vietnam styled desserts too :
4
Food is nice and affordable.. I just hope they have a bigger venue for sitting down inside. I've been here more than 3 times and I like the food very much. Must try the snails and fried spring rolls.
4
I love Vietnamese food.... Heard about this place from a friend really really happy to come and try it out simple place with great food at a good price.... I will be back.... Hopefully soon.
4
This is as authentic as it can be in Singapore. Even the waitresses speaks minimal English. Reasonable pricing and quite a good spread of variety makes it a place to go to for viet eats. Only thing is the queue. Can be quite a pain.

Despite the rather insipid pho (I had the mixed beef pho), the grilled chicken was flavourful with a lovely lemongrass perfume. The kangkong, while not spicy, was fried well with a delicate charring to the garlics. Not bad for a tiny cafe tucked away in some non-descript location

Well, don't get me wrong. No biggie really means a few things:1) The food - nothing to shout about. Seriously, I have tasted tastier broth for pho2) The price - not that great value for money3) The service - I asked 3 times when she takes my order to NOT put any onions on ALL the bowls of pho I ordered. All 3 came with onions.4) Complaints - no big complaints either! :DIn fact, I thought their Vietnamese spring roll was quite good.BUT, I did find a few things weird:1) When we were seated and looking through the menu, overheard the next table complaining that the vegetable dish she ordered was spicy when she "specifically said no chilli because of the two children" (she did have two pretty young children!) and the waitress kinda just shrugged and said "no chilli, no chlli' and then proceeded to repeat in Mandarin and walk away.... maybe that explains why my 3 bowls of pho all came with onions despite my request?!2) noodles in soup (like pho) should be served with a soup spoon - but there was only the dinner metal fork and spoon available.... strange huh?3) their main popular dessert item - the chendol - was served on a disposable plastic cup as if telling you "don't eat your dessert here, bring with you to the cashier, pay and go..." Lol!!! And the website had the picture of the chendol in such a classic pose!

Living so close to Little Vietnam, it is of little wonder then that this restaurant has become sort of our default go-to place when scrounging for good food but too lazy to go farther than the 200m radius.:) Little Vietnam is one of those treasure places where you have good chances of hitting the jackpot in taste half of the time. Sure, not everything is scrumptious here, but there are dishes you can't go wrong with. For example, their Vietnamese fried chicken meal with rice and egg is always a good choice. Chicken is always crispy and tasty and the portion won't leave you hungry. I used to love their chicken noodles but somehow, quality has deteriorated over time. When it comes to their appetiser, we always order the deep-fried spring rolls which is also quite good. One time, my husband tried the duck noodles and it was terrible! The broth was pungent and the duck meat itself looked and tasted really old and awful. From then on, he never dared to experiment with other dishes and would thus stick with their fried chicken. The price is quite reasonable, like I said. And while the waitresses are fast and attentive most of the time, it can get tough to order especially when you have questions about your dish because they don't speak English. The other night, i was asking if I could switch the standard leg chicken part to breast part, the waitress didn't even know what breast part is. She kept pointing to her leg and looking at me apologetically. So if you're murderously famished, I suggest you just go ahead and quickly choose what you want and avoid asking questions as you might end up getting frustrated by the fact that you can't get your message across properly.:) All in all, Little Vietnam is still a good place to eat ang hang out a bit with friends. The place is always packed at night, especially on Fridays, so expect to queue up especially when you swing by around 7 or so

In the most unexpected spot on the island came a row of eateries and restaurants. Little Vietnam stands out among them, with traditional Vietnamese phos and dishes prepared by Vietnamese.Being there for many years, food standard just go without saying. If you have been to Vietnam and is missing their delicacies greatly, this is probably one place you would like to go. It is also good for families.The great view of the cleaned-up canal is also calming as you dine by the side. Closes at 1am on weekends as I was told, with limited seating indoor, but the main draw and most seating are in the outdoor area.Wait staff may seem impatient and don't smile much, but thinking back, they've been working everyday on long hours...they still respond to your smile though. So, don't expect top notch service, but just authentic Vietnamese food with a rather nice ambiance

The food is of average quantity and quality. The prices are low, compared to say nearby Long Phuang @ Joo Chiat (which has much better quality food). We found it annoying that the waitresses (all of Vietnamese origin) have poor command of English and had difficulty taking our orders. They got most right, but missed serving my cold Vietnamese tea. The al fresco dining along the canal is nice, especially with a breeze blowing. We were there at 5 pm on Wednesday, encountering no crowd. Our bill came to $28.10 for 6 items including drinks and desserts

spoil mussel, not fresh prawn, long queue, customer service was so bad when there is a misunderstanding between customer and waitress (basically because of language barrier) then the cashier acting like she is right and never ever said a single apology and acted in the manner that she's donating to customer some coins, what the hell is this service, u tell me Little Viet Nam. the very basic understanding in customer service is to say sorry even though u r right or wrong, customer is ALWAYS the king

As a Vietnamese, I always like Little VN for the large variety of food and some rare dishes that I cannot get anywhere else even though the ambience and service are just so so.But today, I had a very bad experience when I came here with a friend, who is not Vietnamese. At the beginning, we had to queue for really long to get a table for 2, which is not a problem for me. After we got a table, we had to wait really long again before someone took our order, even though we called a few waitresses and they all asked us to wait. After we finished dinner, my friend went to the cashier to make payment and 3 waitresses attacked him in Vietnamese trying to say something to him. He couldn't understand so he brought one of them to me for translation. That waitress accused my friend of owing the restaurant 70 cents (?!) the last time he came here alone. According to her, there was a guy (who she believed is my friend) went to the restaurant, ordered 10+$ dinner and couldn't afford to pay so he begged (in Vietnamese!!) her to lend him 70c. I translated to my friend and he said that he never came here alone. Moreover, he couldn't speak Vietnamese hence her accusation is absolutely incorrect. I already explained everything to her very clearly and told her that she might have mistaken my friend with someone else. I even went to talk to the 2 cashiers to set things straight. To my surprise, this waitress acted very rudely and dismissed my explanation. She insisted on blaming my friend and didn't apologize for her wrong accusation.I have never made any reviews on fb or anywhere else before. But this incident is absolutely unacceptable and rude, especially when it came from people from my own country. I feel very disappointed and angry. I am beyond words to express my disappointment...This is Singapore, where customer service plays a very important role in retaining customers. Hope you do something to improve the quality of service of your restaurant

Cheap, tasting, well cooked, i think is one of the vest places around the area.average price and quality is excellent. The service is fast, most of them don't speak english but does it matter? They are friendly and always smiling. Very recommendable 😃

Enjoy the dinner tonight with family. Prices are reasonable and quality of foods are satisfactory. Quite crowded even on Wednesday night and service quite slow.

Always loved viet food but seldom get to eat coz hubby doesn't like..n if I eat alone, I can't order a variety, so I make it a point to go with sis every year she is back. We heard so much about Little Vietnam in Grandlink square, always a long q when I passed by, so we decided to try it tonight. My my my, what a dissapointment, I seldom post about over rated food because usually they are over rated but still taste pretty decent, but not tonight's dinner! Here's what we hadThe ok ones1) spring roll (non deep fried) nothing much to shout about, just average2) pork chop w riceProbably one of the better dishes tonight, pork was pretty flavourful 3) papaya salad w prawns Average, pretty refreshingThe lousy ones1) beef combination phoMy first time eating viet pho where they don't even use authentic pho! They used ipoh hor fun! What a joke. The beef was tough n overcooked. Soup was bland. After I ate that bowl, I feel like my craving for pho was not satisfied at all2) cockles stir fry in spicy tamarind sauceNo tinge of spiciness at all. Cockles was not fresh. Sis n I were looking forward to this but guess what, we couldn't eat anymore after a few pieces. Total let down 3) stir fry beef cubes with fries for d kidsAgain rock hard beef. Even simple things like fries was bland. Did they run out of salt?4) fried chicken wings for kidsOnce again bland tasteless wings . They don't believe in seasoning their food? Experience The place was very crowded. We were there on Sunday around 6.15pm n manage to get a table for 3A2C squeezing into a table for 4. After we sat, it took them so long to come n take our order even though we kept waving at them. Table was small n with the food coming in one aft another, we barely had space but they don't care, they just pass u the plate of food n expect u to do your own arrangement. They also don't bother to clear the empty plates on the table. When we were settling the bill, they even got us the wrong bill.Seriously, there are so many nicer places around serving authentic viet food. May not be as cheap but who cares about cheap food if it doesn't even taste gd. Hai..waste of calories.

(Be aware that the restaurant is closed on Mondays.)We went to Little Vietnam a couple of times during our stay in Singapore.The food is rather good, we always enjoyed our dinner there. They have many options in the menu to choose from.In the evening peak dinner hours you might need to wait a couple of minutes to get a free table.The service is a bit hectic. The waitresses can be really busy with the many tables and then service gets slower. Also, misunderstandings happen; once we got a different dish than what we ordered and once for some reasons it took a couple of rounds to get a pair of chopsticks. But stay patient, keep smiling and they will appreciate it
4
Good offering of choices at an affordable price!The quality of the food is one of those that were closed to the authentic Vietnam.The priced at below restaurant and slightly above food court. A bowl of pho is at S$5.Be there early for dinner as they can be very crowded if you are late
3
It seems to me that like Thai food, Vietnamese food doesn't travel well!I realise that food has to be localized, but the Pho was lacking in Star Anise and cinnamon. It was ok but nothing more. The summer rolls and been made and long time and refrigerated and the rice skins were as sticky as fly papers!!Taste was ok but lacked Vietnamese mint. The pork and prawn on sugar cane was average.Its a busy place and light of the distinct lack of Vietnamese food in Singapore it seems to do well. Note they don't take Credit Cards- cash only

I went there yesterday night. Crowded but we did not wait long. Quick order. So far so good. Then I was given my food and half an hour later (I was far finished by then) my friend was given his ... Very nice to come for a dinner and finally eating separately ... Worst service I came across in Singapore so far (its been 4 years im there). I do not recommend this place. Cherry on top: they do not take credit cards nor NETS (a real shame ...) and of course they don't tell you in advance so you have to go withdraw cash in the closest ATM in geylang which is 10 minutes away and lose 30 minutes just to get 20 bucks .... Bravo the whole team..

Was told of this small Vietnamese restaurant by a friend. On my first visit, I had a bowl of beef pho (noodle soup) and rice rolls. They were delicious because it taste like what you find in Vietnam. The soup was clear, fragrant and very tastely. The portion of beef generous and the fresh vegetables plentiful. The rice rolls, imho, a bit lacking primarily because they were pre made and kept in the fridge before serving.Today, I went with my 2 foodie friends. We ordered the roasted quails (superbly done), grilled salted prawns which were soft and succulents. Beef pho again, which didn't disappoint. We also had a delicious prawn pancake; and the stirred fried pork with morning glory which tasted much better than it looked.Overall, I really enjoyed the taste of authentic Vietnamese food in this place as it is run by Vietnamese. And, the best part, the price is real affordable.Also, they have alfresco seating along Geylang 'river', which on a cool evening, it a wonderful place to have dinner.I strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for real Vietnamese food in Singapore.PS. they are real popular and go early for either lunch or dinner. If not, you will end up queuing and certain popular dishes will sell out fast

My girl friend recommended the restaurant. She said this is really nice and she like it. The restaurant looks small but cosy especially the outdoor seat. The problem with the outdoor seat will be it might rain and people can smoke outside. However if it is windy, that is the best seating area.Little Vietnam restaurant has an extensive menu at affordable prices. There is No GST or service charge. It is also recommended as one of the 5 best Vietnam Restaurant in Singapore. We ordered some side dishes to share. Fried spring roll, fried chicken and vietnamese famous rice roll. I still like the rice roll the most. My friend ordered the salad and I feel that is nice too.As usual I got the pho Tai Bo Vien(Sliced Beef and Beef Balls), I always like to try out the pho at any vietnamese restaurant that I went. Reason being I like the clear soup base with full taste. The version here is good.http://rainfooddiary.blogspot.sg/2014/09/little-vietnam-cafe-and-restaurant.htm

Best vietnamese food in Singapore at affordable prices but it gets very crowded and they don't take reservations . They have an extensive menu. Try the cockles its really good and their Pho is very good. If you crave for Vietnamese food, better go early and start queuing for a table ,but expect to wait half hour for a table at peak times
