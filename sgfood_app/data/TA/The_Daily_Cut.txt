Amazing food and amazing service. Visited them recently and the food they serve is amazing. I believe this kind of food is good for health.

Visited this place just after 11am as it gets really busy after 11.30am and esp. closer to 12pm. Went for the regular option which includes 1 meat. The portion is filling enough for 1 person.

One of my favourite healthy lunch spot in the CDB area.
From ordering to payment to dining, process was fast and easy without any fuss. Choose whatever protein and vegetables you need.
Everything was so good and fresh. Big love!

Came here on a recommendation and it was way better than I expected. The queue was long but quick and the order system avoids any wasted time so it's very efficient.
Quality and taste was great. Will be coming back here on next visit.

I was simply strolling around one day when I chanced upon this restaurant. I tried it and was blown away by how amazing their food tasted. To add cherry to the cake, they are listed on Waitrr, an electronic menu app where I can choose my food and pay it instantly at the comfort of my home. I can choose if I were to eat there or take away. Overall, a nice experience

This place used to be great--tasty and healthy food and excellent service! It was always somewhat costly, but worth every penny.I hadn't gone there for some time as I got a bit tired of it after eating there every day for quite some time. And I came back this week and what a disappointment. They replaced some of their best items with lower cost ones (amazing chicken breast replaced with fatty disgusting parts, nice fresh vegetables replaced less great ones, etc; they stopped serving salt !?!? etc). They have a large guy who spits around all the time, and he is the one that receives and examines everyone's food--really disgusting. Indeed, there used to be a huge line of people and not surprisingly it is gone.It is really a shame. I guess they are on their way out

I went two weeks ago and had a great experience - fast service even during the busy lunchtime rush and quality food. I went again this week and it was remarkable how bad it had become. The new menu has cheaper cuts of protein (moist and flavourful chicken breast has been replaced by fatty tasteless chicken thigh with slimy skin), basic vegetables like carrots and snow peas replaced by nondescript options, the capsicum was not cooked properly and they've replaced the yellow peppers with green ones (which are cheaper for a reason). They had a lot of people behind the counter but had lost control of giving people their order - customers were not lining up in the right way, but it's up to the staff to tell them to keep the system flowing. It took 5 mins to get served but nearly 15 to actually get my order. It's clear they are trying to save costs through low cost items on the menu, but unfortunately that also means serious low quality too. Shame

Healthy food options never come cheap as with The Daily Cut. But the portions were generous and the food and vegs are so fresh. Definitely a cut above the rest of its competitors. Sauces are self service and also very good in flavor. Having perks and loyalty discounts will be awesome

I just love this salad bar. You get a choice of 3 size salads to pick from and then choose your salad... If you want extra's it is only S$1 per portion/item. Usually if I am hungry i choose the medium size salad and not so hungry the small salad. The large one for me is to much. They have plenty of items to choose from suitable for both meat, fish and vegetarian lovers. The staff are friendly and efficient. You have the option to take away or eat it... usually the bar does get busy over lunchtimes and again between 6-7ish after work. The food is constantly being prepared in the kitchen behind the counter so you know the items are fresh..

We arrived before noon and managed to get a seat before the lunch crowd came. Do take note that they have limited seating which are also quite cramped. Since it's in the business district, it will be extremely crowded during lunch time on weekdays. Though the queue is long, it moves at a decent rate. I ordered pasta with broccoli, beef, avocado and cheese. The beef was quite flavourful, but also very chewy. (my jaw was sore from chewing :P ) The pasta was too 'jelak' after a while. The portions were good for the pricing. I ended up not finishing some of my pasta and beef.. A bit too much for me! (mom helped with the leftovers

Healthy and really nice food. I always come here, join the long queue, and never regretted my order. If only they can have longer operating hours, or deliveries, then it would be better.

The place was very small and cramped. Be prepared to share tables. Sitting area of maybe less than 25. Had the fish mushroom and egg.

The daily cut provides good clean eats. They got decent protein range, good vegetables and side. Most of the items are boiled simply without much salt and oil. Which makes for a healthy meal. Can be easily made at home though....

If you go after 11:30 am, there is always a long queue at this place. Main reason is it's pretty cheap for the amount of food (especially proteins) you get! Otherwise, there are places in the neighbourhood that serve more creative salads. And the proteins are not high quality: the steaks are too chewy and too cooked, the chicken too dry, the fish too bland

If you want a healthy lunch but are not a salad person, this might just be the place for you. The standard sized box lunch gets you one protein, one carb and 3 supplements (sides) for S$12. You add S$1 for the premium proteins like the steak. Portions are generous and on this visit, I could see they are making a killing with the health conscious gym going crowd. Points to note:- the ribeye steak is cooked medium well- apart from the romaine and spinach leaves, most of the vegetable options are served cooked - no sauce or salad dressing but I think you can request olive oil or hot sauce on the sideThere isn't much seating onsite and the space allocated is small and not that well lit. Most patrons get their food to go

Amazing food, small selection but you don't really get bored of mix and matching your own choices ^^ Chicken is cooked inconsistently, at the later part of the day it gets tough and hard.. but during lunch time or earlier, it tastes really moist. Fish is a better bet

Tried their branch at Tanjong Pagar and it was a good lunch! You need to come early as the place is packed during lunch time. There are few choices of portion starting from Petite to XL. I find that even the regular one is really filling (see photos). Best of all is actually, pick your own toppings.

A Great place for just the right amount of protein , carbs and vegetables- your choice of Steak, chicken ( thigh or breast) , turkey, salmon, prawns or Tou Fu. A good array of vegetables to choose from and the carbohydrates you want. Never disappoints and am always happy after a meal her

If you are healthy conscious and believe in eating right portion, The Daily Cut menu suits you. Its pricing is on mid-range scale and determines the meal portion and types of food categories you going to have. For the perfect meal, choose the S$12.00 option to avoid side effect of going to sleep mode after lunch. From my personal experience, it is THE perfect meal. The only issue here is long queue and lack of space to eat in.

If the thought of eating salad for a meal doesn't whet your appetite, you might want to give The Daily Cut a try and change your mind. This restaurant serves very satisfying, protein-rich salad options from $12-$18 range, depending on the number of proteins you desire. You could have sliced steak, grilled tilapia fillet, crispy skin grilled salmon, shrimps and many more as your protein, together with your choice of vegetables and complex carbs such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, lettuce, spinach and many more.My boyfriend thinks that it's amazing and so do I. Please open up more stores, especially in the East side! :
