High end buffet serving excellent selection of seafood, Chinese, Indian, and desserts. Service staff did a good job on a very busy night. Large groups handled well.

I strongly recommend the line if the budget suits you. Overall the food is good and service excellent. The clesring of empty plates were timely and with a friendly smile.
Great variety from local hawker food, international, japanese, western. They have it all.
5
Good quality food and good service provided, although the price was a bit on the expensive side. Overall excellent

You can enjoy a sumptuous breakfast in Line resturant but notice service is lacking and server behind the counter are unfriendly when the restuarant is packed.

The Line @ Shangri-La Hotel used to be high-end dining with pleasant experiences, coupled with good quality food and environment. However standard has dipped a little since my last visit in Jan 2017.
2
All food are cold one, and the staff never come to clean the plate. For me it is not worth for money.
5
Went on the 4th day of CNY - there is yusheng, CNY tarts and special dishes prepared specially for CNY- stewed beef cubes, soup with abalone slices and sea cucumber... plus the original international cuisine - where else can we get all quality buffet under one roof? Will definitey go again...very soon!
4
2nd time there. Staff made you feel welcoming and the food selection is wide. However, toward the end, the clearing of the empty plates slowed down and we waited 20 mins for our bill. Luckily we are not in a rush, else this experience would be a deal-breaker
5
Spent 5 nights at the hotel which included the buffet breakfast. Despite eating here each morning there is so much variety that you can’t get bored. In addition to the variety (cuisine from so Nationalities) the quality was solid. Was able to try so many different foods. Service was great as one expects from Shangri-La.
5
The food quality and variety was great! Really loved the hummus (I’ve never seen it at any buffets)! I’ve been to the Line quite a few times and the food is always just as good!! Only sad thing is that they don’t serve salmon belly sashimi for lunch... which I found to be a bit strange, but all is good :)
5
Exquisite range of food options at buffet line as always. Very much appreciated the birthday cake provided for a birthday celebration.
Ambiance was a bit dark due to a faulty light at our seat around.
5
Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner is amazing here consistantly... i would recomend being outside or the outer layer of inside as it does get busy but for a reason so mnay choices all of top quality.
5
The food is quite good. I ordered off the menu but they do have a dinner buffet that is amazing. Most every kind food that you could want though it is a bit pricey.
5
We have breakfast, and there is no need for want. It's all there and more
Perfection in all aspects of food and service.
World class leader

Very nice dinner with many choices. The price is a bit high. May consider to go again if I have vip customers.

I was having a good time at The Line. Food quantity was quite good with quite a large variety of different food from different cuisine to choose from. The one food that i would like to recommend is the roasted pork belly (chinese cuisine). The fat and meat ratio was at 2:3 and i think all the fat lover will fall in love with this dish; the roasted and caramelised skin was crispy and complement well with the meat and fat. My opinion, I felt that the price of the buffet lunch was on the high side. However, the services provided by the restaurant stuff was good and friendly, especially Ms Hannah who served my wife and i on 22/1/2018 was attentive. We were given a birthday cake compliment from the hotel and we were able to take away the cake as we were too full to eat after the lunch.
2
The food reminded me of being in an airline lounge - it's fine, but nothing to write home about. My expectations were very high, given the reviews I'd seen and the final blow was when the bill came - over $100 for an adult WITHOUT alcohol. Madness. Won't be going bac
4
It is located in the central of Singapore, yet isolated from crowded city. We enjoy the scene very much. There is large variety of food to chose, bot drink and main course are great. The only regretful part is too many flies around the seats. Time by time we need to wave off those unexpected guest
5
I enjoyed the breakfast buffet here whilst staying at the Shangri-La Hotel. The choice of different cuisines, fruit, breads etc was just unbelievable! I have never seen such a huge buffet spread - you could definitely eat here for a week and still not try everything on offer.It is fairly expensive but it's a treat, and you really do get a lot for your money.I did notice one evening that the restaurant was extremely busy and very loud with lots of large groups, so that put me off eating there on that occasion but otherwise I would thoroughly recommend it as an incredible gastro-experience
5
A group of 6 of us enjoyed the Sunday Brunch buffet, eating and chatting the whole afternoon till 3pm! Our favorite counters would be the fresh seafood bar and Sashimi Bar. Super sweet scallop sashimi they served! Oh and the Laksa, really flavorful!The Line is our first choice when we organize gatherings.
5
The seafood spread was really good and the crabs were really juicy and flavorful.
The dessert bar though, i felt, regressed in quality and creativity since last year
4
A great variation of international cuisine. Japanese, Chinese, English, Italian, Indian, seafood and desserts. Some of the roasted meat were quite dry and tough. Make sure to go early as they stop refilling certain items at about 9pm
5
Tried both their breakfast and dinner. Rated 5 stars as spread was great even for breakfast. Many choices for international guests.
4
Lunch buffet in this restaurant is good. Lots of friendly staff. A staff name Gina is very eye for detailed and another staff name Vita at the coffee station, her service is very good too. Would come back in the future to dine.
4
Service was good. Wide array of delectable food selection. Perhaps can consider adding chocolate fondue accompanied with candies, fruits and marshmallow which will be great for both children and adults alike

Thu, 4 Jan 2018Office lunch of 24 paxArrived at 12.40pm and promptly seated within 2mins. The place was not full; just the right balanced crowd. We sat indoors and they have limited seating outdoors too.Navigating the serving stations was pure fun. Cuisine after cuisine, desserts after desserts and the freshly ground coffee beans station.Cutleries, napkins on table good to go with basic deco (*so we have more space to struggle later). Iced water served by staff is adequate with regular replenishments. These water glasses are good angled to feed sips with less effort.I had 5 courses and definitely felt bloated after. Seafood was fresh. Scallops, crabs, black mussels, green mussels, clams were good & juicy. Never tried the prawns, but colleagues said were good. Only thing the prawns oozes out their black 'juice' from the head. Now that looked unpleasantly fresh.Sauces come in 3 flavours... I had seafood with their freshly sliced baguette. Good crisp texture with soft inside.Sushi & sashimi are fresh with live station & chefs dishing out their skills. Typically long queue here.Naan, lamb shank curry and satay (bite-size meat on wooden skewer) are next. I must say the lamb shank curry is not spicy, which is understandable looking at the demographics of the hotel guests. Good combination with acar (pickled sliced veggies) to bring out the taste.Noodle station. They might have everything that noodles has the offer. Do state your order & the chef will prepare within 2mins. Of all the noodle, I did not pick any. Instead I asked for everything laksa without the noodle but stocked it up with fresh seafood instead. Again, the laksa gravy is not spicy and the accompanying sambal (local chill sauce) is kinda sweet. So no spike in spiciness.Lastly, I had roast beef with freshly tossed prawn salad. This is the highlight. Finally I get a strong taste in my food here. Meat is rather tough, just need a lil more time to chew down and a thicker sauce would be better.There were many more stations which I give a pass. Italian, Chinese & steamed stuff, roasted turkey, cheese, Middle Eastern etc etc. Do have a good walk thru & pick out a format of big dish alternate with small dish. This way, you don't stretch your belly fast.Desserts were just out of this world. Too much to write! You cannot have every piece of a good dessert there. Firstly you almost overeat main course after main course, and now realised there's no place for all dessert! Skim down to non-dairy ones if you feel bloated. Head to the coffee station for that good cuppa. I had Masala tea! Yes, they have it at The Line. Never tried any other dessert, just the Masala tea.Wayfinding & moving around was easy. But do expect congestion during weekends & holidays. Staff are always alert & know their products well. I must thank the floor staff for the good experience we had. Also kudos to the kitchen team for the good presentation & high food quality. We applaud you!There is a smoking corner at the far end outdoor seating. Good view of the backyard.Lastly, though it's tough to justify the price tag per person; the food quality, trained staff with calm interior and of course, in Shangri-La Hotel, we can say it is worth the money.Good quality food, good quality service in a 5-star environment.Thank you The Line for making our experience an excellent one
5
Spacious to cater for most guests and the best variety of every cuisine for the fussiest eater. The freshest pastries and fruits were a highlight as well as the fruit muesli and fresh egg stations. The staff were attentive and impressive as the Hostess remembered our names each morning.
4
We are having our year end dinner at The line last night. It was arranged by the company.The first weird thing is that they call us at 1pm to inform cannot use the credit card promotion even they already confirm the book with this promotion. We got shock and ask them to double confirm. Finally they allow us to use it, Thanks God!If you are food lover, you will be enjoying to come here. Many foods are waiting and all are delicious and well decorated.The staff are with smile and ready to serve at whenever we need them.The ice cream is the best at the end of the meal. It is not watery and not hard too. Love to go there again on next year event
5
Came on Tuesday night with friends. Each day their theme is different. Tuesday is seafood and free flow of drinks inclusive of wine, champagne, beer. The food station varieties has so many choices. Indian, Chinese, Japanese, western etc. Loved their sashimi- salmon and yellow tail itâ€™s so fresh. Their lobster is also another highlight but got to wait as everyone is snatching for that too. Dessert has a good spread too. If you are looking for different varieties do come here. Its slightly on the high end side but worth it
4
Food was good with lots of choices. But restaurant was very crowded and it was bit noisy. We thought our dinner will be just an 'ordinary' meal ( nothing special ). Until we stop by the western counter, there was a chef name Chea Hui who impressed us with her very friendly approach. Chef Chea Hui did an amazing job by explaining us about the food and the restaurant (as it was our first time there). Thank you Chef Chea Hui, amazing Hospitality! Definitely will be back again
4
Fresh seafood. However the deco of the restaurant is average. Wide selection is available. Limited Sushi variety.
3
So so only, doesnt worth the money. More varieties in term of dessert would be better. Lobster laksa and prawn noodle was a total failure. Salmon, oysters and prawns are fresh.
2
Having seen all the photos of the spread of buffet food selection, we were psyched and was planning all the foods we’d be eating. Turned out not to be the case, the seafood selection was dismal for a place named “The Line”. The Alaskan crab legs that are always in the advertisement photos were nowhere to be seen. Quality of yabbies were not great and prawns (the only good thing there) kept running out.The other stations did have a good selection but the crowd were pushy and impatient - not an experience I would want to try again
4
The customer service at The Line is impleccable. I have very good service from the staff. They have a good line up of food stations to choose from. I could not finish the stations because it is just too many. Unfortunately, they do not serve oysters during lunch time.
5
Delicious. My mouth is still watering when I think about the food here. This is a must visit for me when I come back to this country
4
Went there for a birthday celebration (didn't get the complimentary cake unlike the other two patrons next table to mine! But the wide array of dessert selection was good enough, thankfully, esp the ice cream) will be there again!
4
A bit disappointed that they no longer serve oysters during lunch buffet. Overall, quality of seafood and dessert is good
5
The food was great, seafood was fresh but octopus at the cold section wasn’t up to standard. It was frozen octopus, would appreciate if it wasn’t that way but other Than that, food was prettty good.
4
The Line has always been my go to place for International buffet and fresh seafood. Their laksa is also a must have. My last visit has kind of mixed feelings as I feel that the standard in service and good variety has dropped. Staffs were no longer attentive to your needs. Stations understaffed resulting in long queue for food. Food replenish was also slow leaving a lot of people cluttering at the station. Food selection was vast been missing pizza and fried stuffs. While the BBQ beef was good, there used to be more variety of BBQ meats. Not sure if this is due to them running a promo but that should not affect overall quality.
3
Our previous visit was better than this time. They did not have lobster claws. Liked the desserts the best
5
Really tasty dishes from a range of Asian and western cuisines; lovely fresh seafood, yummy deserts - tons of choices.
5
So many different cuisines to choose from! Loved the Japanese sushi and sashimi - made freshly in front of you.
5
Very good variety, service is very good too. Love the beef and also the desserts. Will definitely come back again.
5
The Line does not disappoint. Like her sister hotel in Sentosa, the buffet selection at the Line is one of the best I have experienced!
4
The friendly service made this visit worthwhile! Food variety is ok. Food quality is above average. For us, it is one particular staff that made the difference
3
Yes. I mean it, what is the fuss? Is it because its "Shangrila" then it equals to good food?Ive been to better buffets and lower than their price point. The japanese section is good, fresh sahimis and so are the cocktails of crab, clams, oysters and other seashells.The beef carving thou was bland to say the least. Their pork belly was the best seller, imagine that, Shangrila and the pork belly tasted better than their roast beef.Ordered a fresh aglio olio from the chef, and he recommended i order it with anchovies so it will have flavor, I followed his advice and boy did I regeret it. It was salty, like eating a spoonful of salt with the pasta.Well anyway the rest of the items they had was just so so. And they are not cheap
5
This restaurant has one of the widest choices of Asian and international foods I have been to. I'm especially keen on their seafood selection, and there have always been great oysters when I have been there! There are also really good roasts as well as Indian, Chinese and Japanese food. The day I went there was an Australian theme as well with kangaroo and crocodile stews. They also have a barbecue. The service is very efficient and there is a woman who makes balloons in the shape of animals for the children. Highly recommended
5
It was Tuesday dinner with my colleagues. Yes, the price can be considered as expensive but considering the (1) spread - variety of the food they offer - fresh seafood, local and international cuisine, (2) the ambiance, (3) the quality of service -- is really worth the money. The staff are very attentive, they will clear your table promptly though you need to ask them few times to refill your drinks. But overall experience, two-thumbs up and definitely will be back
5
So much selection even the kids love it! Seafood section was so fresh! I love how the crab legs are already cut open so we wasted no time and eat! Really good quality Parma ham they served. It would be perfect if they provide pan fry service at the Foie Gras station. Laksa was awesome with half a lobster. Must try!For the Juices/Drinks station, only orange juice are really freshly squeezed. Apple, mango and guava juice are bottled juice. Grill station (outdoor) will be available for this month, they served chicken, lamb, beef, portabella mushrooms and vegetables. Service was fantastic, the staffs were very attentive and always puts on a smile. Appreciate that even though they are quite busy
5
The food was never disappoint me and my family. But this time round, there is no oyster. Been paying the same price but no oyster. Staff service was excellent as i in pro ask them for a birthday cake and sing song to brithday man. They did it happily. Thank
5
A great experience with a plethora spread of delightful treats and hearty meats. Standard is still high.
1
Would have given zero star. Came here to celebrate my birthday as it's one of my favourite buffet places for the past 7 years. It was so disappointing when i came here for lunch with my mum yesterday. Besides not having oysters (my mum loves their fresh tasty oysters in the past), the variety and quality of food has decreased so much! I cannot even point out one single food item that tasted good. The desserts were most disappointing. They used to have great variety of pretty and tasty cakes but now none of them were seen. Only miserly small pieces of cakes and kueh and jelly cups being served and they tasted horribly too sweet. Service was great by the waitresses but what's the point of good service with such horrible food at such expensive price ($62++ per pax)?!! Very disappointing... will never come back here again. There are more worthy buffets in other hotels.
4
Food was ok. Dessert spread was much better then food though. Good for those who are there for dessert! They provided a birthday cake our the birthday celebration but we didn’t see any names on the cake even though the personnel asked for name of birthday person, a little strange on that.
2
We stayed at The Shangri La in Bangkok and had their international buffet which was excellent. On the back of that we booked the Shangri La in Singapore. So far our experience has not been good but specifically our meal at The Line was disappointing in the extreme. The food was quite good but for the price we paid I would expect more than just good food. Perhaps some atmosphere, good service, politeness? I asked one of the chefs what a particular dish was, he pointed at the label and said 'that'. The name was a local dish name and so I was no wiser. I asked politely what the main element of the dish was and he pointed to a dish of the raw ingredient and said 'that'Still no wiser I asked again and was eventually told it was made from beans!The buffet was not explained to us until we asked and the layout and style is like a cheap cafe; noisy, crowded and no style! The staff are casually dressed and 'service' is basically just clearing the plates. To cap it all we had booked on line and should have had a 15% discount. They first suggested it had been taken off, they then suggested we needed written proof of our booking and perhaps we could go up to our room to get it! Eventually when we were clearly getting very fed up they did honour the discount. Such a sad start to our stay when our experiences of the Shangri La in other cities has been so good
2
When you go down the escalator to The Line restaurant (better named as The Cafe) you leave what should be the style and sophistication that I and many people associate with Shangri La Hotels and enter a noisy, blaring, plastic chairs and tables excuse for a restaurant. Mr Rito as General Manager jump on a plane to Bangkok and see how a real Shangri La does its International Buffet, style, sophistication, a place where you can sit and relax and enjoy the atmosphere. At the Line it's get in, eat and get out. Yes the food is generally very good and lots of it but for a dining experience this is little better than an expensive cafe. It's like the IKEA cafe except there are no Swedish Meatballs available, sadly. No doubt some expensive design consultant came up with this crazy idea, but it's not for a Shangri La at all. Oh and did I say the staff just dump you at a table and dont explain what it's all about. And they got the bill wrong, forgetting the promotion. Want a nice night out, go elsewhere
5
The Line offers a tremendous variety of breakfast dishes from European pastries, waffles, croissants, fresh fruit, cheeses, dim sim, curry, noodles to the bacon and sausages. When staying in this hotel I'd recommend having breakfast here and enjoy the scenery of hotel guest, business people and models alike. Hospitality at it's best in this hotel
5
My friends and I went yo 'The Line' and as we enter the Shang-ri La Hotel lobby, you can smell the relaxing fragrance, its like an invitation to just spend the time to chill and relax.We proceed to our reservation and while waiting for the rest of the gang, i roam around to see what 'the line' has to offer. To my surprise, they really have a wide variety of seafoods, meats, vegetables, bread and dessert. It's so awesome i don't even know where to start :). There are a lot to choose from! For starters I ate the oyster, salmon, scallops and maki. Then off to the meat section, tender beef and bread. Next are the cooked food like pork knuckle some noodles and famous lobster prawn laksa. There is also an indian section which i only ate the beef and chicken satay. And for finalle, the dessert! You can choose from cake, muffin and ice cream. And there's coffee and tea too
5
Shangri-La lives up her name! There is a wide spread of food, ranging from crabs, lobsters, oysters, caviar, variety of foie gras, many other international cuisine, love the dessert and Japanese section too with my favourite durian cake and scallop sashimi! The waiters are attentive and one of them has outof initiative prepared a surprised bday cake for my boyfriend, he felt so pampered! Thank you for the wonderful experience!
5
Not only was the variety and quality exceptional, many of the stations had chefs that would cook separate dishes from scratch and miss out the non-coeliac-friendly ingredients such as soy and flour. There is really too much to get through in one sitting. Perhaps the only downside was that the desserts were not quite as plentiful from a gluten free point of view as it could have been, but by this point in the dining experience one’s hunger is more than satisfied. One thing I would add, is that the drinks package may not be worth it; the house wine by the glass was excellent and you would need to drink 4 glasses before it made economic sense. Again, there is far too much quality food to experience everything in one evening, perhaps it would be best to book in for consecutive nights to familiarise yourself with the whole buffet and inevitable pile on the pounds!
2
Think this buffet really need to improve on the quality of the food and have more interesting cooking style of food. Most Hotels buffet had improved a lot but only this buffet line is getting bad to worst.1.The Indian food area only beef rendan is good the chicken is too hard and taste is blend, the yellow bean is too watery.2. Satay area is a popular area why only two griller and the chef was trying very hard but can't cope with the crowd. ( I waited 3 round for the beef satay but never get it.)3.Dimsum portion is so big 4. Cold side is horrible the crab is too small to have any meat and it should have more sauce for us to dip. (Will be great to have some hot sauce)Only the service by Auntie New is up to 5 star
2
It used to be much better in terms of selection and quality. Getting Too mass market and the service has dropped.
5
We stayed at the Shangri la and had breakfast as part of our booking
The choice is astounding with food from across the globe, some of the best coffee i've had at a hotel buffet breakfast with attentive staff
4
A very large variety of all sorts of food. Attentive service staff too. Only issue is that many of them don't speak English!
4
The food is good as always and the desserts one of the best! However it's a pity that they took away the salmon belly and oysters till dinner.
5
From a homesick Singaporean living abroad, meals for 5 days at The Line sorted out all my cravings. There was no time to visit Newton circus hawker centre, but there was no need anyway, as the accomodating chefs whipped up all that i desired to eat! Thank you to Ganesh and his team. They made my stay so memorable, and have made this hotel my first choice for the next trip back
5
I visit The Line very often, the most recent one was 23 August when I went for a dinner  buffer with my daughter. The moment I climbed down the escalator, the hostess, Lea approached me when I reached the steps and helped me down by the hand and brought me to my favourite table which was in front of the dessert section. Within minutes my usual amenities was laid on my table. I then went for the Asian food - kung poh chicken, steamed fish, fried hor fun and old-cucumber soup. The moment I turned around an attractive waitress took over my tray and brought it to my table! This is really service. I continue to enjoy the evening with satay and various Indian dishes like the Tandorin Chicken - very exotic indeed!I then marched on to the pasta station. Here the chef recognised me as a returned guest and without ado prepared my spaghetti in the way I like it with my favourite ingredients. He told me to return to my seat as he will sent it to me.I also had Sushi at the Japanese counter which I never give it a miss when I visit The Line.My Dinner is never com[lete without the yummy desserts, fruits and ice cream, not forgetting the aromatic coffee.Last month I celebrated my 78th birthday at The Line and I also celebrated my 70th birthday in the iconic restaurant
3
Price for buffet is on the higher end so expectations was higher. The Japanese counter was good - from the sashimi, cooked food to service. There were varieties of seafood like crabs, prawns, mussels, etc but the quality was a mixture. Some were fresh but some were 'mushy'. However, i do personally like the crayfish laksa, teh tarik and the desserts
4
This is the reincarnation of the former Garden Restaurant (I think that's what it used to be called years ago) in the Shangri-la hotel. We'll known for a sumptuous buffet, and became absolutely the largest buffet spread ever when it reopened as The Line. Tables and tables of good food all corners of the world including grilled meat and seafood outside, air flown oysters, crab, lobster and a huge spread of desserts including cold stone ice cream. However I must say that the quality and spread has suffered on my last visit home and it's not up to the standard I would expect. The prices have definitely gone way up as well. Singapore's still the buffet-lover's heaven, and although this a restaurant is great, there are other buffets that are less pricey and provide great food
3
Rather disappointing as there were few standout dishes in the line-up. The Japanese counter was the best, desserts a tad above average and crispy pork knuckle very good. The crabs were plentiful but small and a little mushy. Better snow crab legs elsewhere. Roast beef was way too lean, and had no accompanying gravy.
5
Review by Dr Sim. I have always enjoyed the Line. Food is of high quality and very good. Service is excellent. Staff remembers your name. Ambience is excellent. Only problem is the high price. Tourists should visit the Line at the Shangri La Hotel. Regards Dr Si
4
spread was legendary
service was top notch
ambience was nice
quality was very good as well
highly recommended
4
We had a table I requested at a quieter corner. A good variety of food but taste can be improved for some. The laksa was thick and rich. Yummy!
2
Setting up not done as per reservation request.
Food counters were not fully manned.
Food were not labeled.
Ran out of pasta at pasta counter.
4
I always love the Shang. Very crowded as usual. Great buffet spread. Chef at sashimi counter has no eye contact with guests. He kept slicing what he likes & what guests are waiting for.Great service staff. There is an Indian boy with long hair, (stylo hair style) he was excellent. He offered my son hot chocolate n dessert looking at my son was just having fries. Great anticipation.Thank you
3
I went for the National Day buffet dinner with high expectations, however the food was just average. The Line is famous for seafood spread, but the seafood that I had that day was not fresh. The prawn meat was tough and chewy. Same for cooked seafood. The local dishes fared much better. The durian spread was the highlight.Despite the food being mediocre, the service of the waiter was excellent. The waiter offered to bring my 7 yr old to the toilet when i was busy with my 4 yr old. He also cleared our plates on time.I will not go there again for the price I have to pay. $200 for 1 adult and child. 5 yrs and below dines free
3
We went for the durian buffet. There was only one staff opening the durian and he couldn't cope with the crowd leading to a v long queue. And the service of that staff wasn't ideal too. Low Quality durian despite saying that it was D24 and red prawn. Disappointing experience
5
A good place with excellent staff. kudos to staff Lam Tony, Ravimaran, Steven G and Eskay Wong for their great service. Attentive, friendly, respectful and thoughtful are their trademark. If you are here for the durian, you need to look Eskay. He is super patient and skilful in opening the durian. Really worth a visit here! The food and their great service will definitely not disappoint you
5
Our visit is for lunch on saturday. Although the restaurant is packed, they always have the food available for serving. Wide range of selection cuisine from around the globe, oferring you a mouth watering experience.I recommed that you should book a table before visiting, waiting for a table during lunch rush is an experienced that you should never experience
3
I was at the Line with my group of friends at 6pm which the buffet started. We wanted to have The Durian first, When we were at the outdoor waiting forbrhe chef to open the durian for us. He ask us to wait we waited for 20mins then he start to open the durian after opening the durian he give to The guy whist just walk in first. The chef is just taking his own sweet time. The quality of durian was not So good and the oyster on that day was not so fresh. The waitress that serve us was good but not the senior waiter. I thought that Amex credit have discount promotion but the senior told us the promotion ended in June and left with my Amex card with the payment. When he pass by our table again I stop him and ask is there any other promotion on other credit card he say yes OCBC card which we don't have. I ask him how about others credit card he say don't have but when the other waiter come back with my Amex card he ask do we have other credit cards so we ask him citi bank can he say can. We can enjoy 15% off the total bill. The senior guy did not bother to tell us more and the credit card promotion. We are very regular customer of the Line restuarant we are there almost every two to three months. We may not go back there again. We will find other better restaurants that have good service and food

In the past, The Line had developed its reputation on the extensive size and quality of the buffet. In the past, the seafood section had long lines.Today the restaurant was half empty and the sparse seafood section was eerily unpatronised. No surprises to diagnose the problem.The physical spread of the food is maintained, but most of the top-end items are missing. No lobster, no oysters, few top-line cold cuts. One positive was the roast beef – superb!Amidst constant competition in Singapore’s buffet space, The Line has lost ground dramatically. It’s not bad, it’s just not up to the standards that the community had once expected of the place. While never positioned as a great value meal, it’s lost ground on the value-for-money scale too.Unfortunately, it fits a consistent pattern at Shangri-La. Dire decline in F&B standards.Good bye, Shangri-La. By the way – my Gold Circle membership is where you put the quality. Once you find that, call me, I’ll be having a good meal up the road
5
Food standard has not changed,just by looking at the desserts makes me very happy.Staffs are very eager to serve
4
Wide selection of food. You just cant go wrong. The buffet dinners are worth trying out. The quality of cooking is perfect
4
Went with whole office for lunch. Great choice as variety is amazing, everyone has something they like, takes away the headache of catering to everybody's needs. Had a great time and staff enjoyed it as well. The fresh seafood and desserts are the best.
4
Revisited after a gap of few years and as usual, very pleased with the food quality and customer service. The multiple cuisine stations also make it easy to accommodate diners' dietary preferences. I really enjoyed lunch there today and will be back.
5
Wide spread of food and service was excellent! From Japanese to Western to Indian to Local food. Definitely will visit again!
5
Great service, good selection of food. Fresh seafood and awesome dessert choice. Good mix of east and west cuisines.
4
It can get a bit busy at times in the morning but never too loud. We were pleasently surprised by the wide choice and variety of both local (Asian) and international food. The sweets are delicoius and the life cooking stations offer so much to enjoy. Not to sure about the decor of the restaurant, but this didn't stop us from having good breakfasts at The Line.

I planned dinner with my girlfriend at the Line to celebrate our Anniversary. The restaurant presented us with a piece of complimentary liquored cake and 2 glasses of champagne. And coincidentally it was a National Day promotion with a feast on tropical fruits, including durians, and some local desserts. It was a sweet treat and a enjoyable dinner. Thank you the Line

We had breakfast in The Line to mark our department's annual bonding event. It was the wisest choice we ever made.The food was of high quality - widespread options to cater to everyone.Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. We are impressed by how the crew would go the extra mile for us. We want to thank Beng Hoe, Ganesan and Manoj for their dedication and service with a smile. 100% satisfaction !!

We were at the line having our normal lunch .Seating were very tight with no room for a normal human to walk past when they added extra tables to cater to some company groups.I don't think they pass the safety requirements if there's any fire hazard and the area is over crowded with people and furniture.Food still maintains at the level of hotel standard . Varieties of food hardly change
4
The line is a great place for informal celebrations with family and friends. The setting is light and food is abundant.
5
We stayed at shangri la apartments. Paid extra to have breakfast included. Good variety and quality by any standard.
3
we loved buffet. we enjoyed the food most of the times at the line. but, recently it doesn't seems the same. food selection wasn't as good as before.
too expensive for the quality and variety of food that they offered in there.
4
It was known as best buffet restaurant in Singapore but I found it too crowded to enjoy my dinner with my wife.
3
Meal did not have an option to exclude drinks, not worthwhile for people who do not take alcohol. Lobster disappeared as soon as it's taken out.. service staff was nice

My family loves the wide spread and freshness of food serve at the Line.On the 09/07/2017, my family and myself wanted to celebrate my brother's birthday, we decided to dine at the Line as it's one of my brother's favorite. Without fail, the wide spread and freshness of the food didn't disappoint us, just that on that day evening the buffet dinner's spread doesn't have/serve Pate, which is one of my brother's favorite and he was looking for it. We were also very pleased with Crystal's attentiveness and pro-activeness in delivering service/assistance to us. She is also very polite, smiley and professional. The waitress Uma, was very friendly and smiley to us and all the customers too. She will strike a conversation(small PR) with her customers and has been seen paying special attention to young children. The Caucasian chef at the western/pasta station is also very friendly and smiley to all the customers. He will greet and offer assistance to the customers too. The chef at the Sushi and Noodles stations was not so friendly. When my mum went to the sushi station, the chef was busy hence she stood there and waiting for the chef. After he has finished cutting the sushi, he just walked away without checking with my mum what she needs.(my mum still standing right in front of the station) After he has returned to the station, my mum who was still standing there started to ordered/ told him what she wants (since the chef didn't bother to ask). His replied to my mum was, " You have to wait as I need to put on the gloves to work(slice the sushi), as it's mandatory for me to do so. My mum was taken a back with his reply, she just ordered what she wants without questioning him; and she also has been standing at the station waiting for him to finish his work first. Not only he didn't deliver service by asking what the customers wants to eat, he even passed unnecessary remarks to the customer which make the customer feels like she is rushing him. He has been seen educating his trainee very fiercely at the station too. The chef at the noodle station also expressionless(not friendly and smiley) when serving. There was once my dad wanted to order the noodle but there wasn't any staff/chef at the station. In the end, he skipped the noodles. Lastly, thank you too all the rest of the staff as well for the great service and good food.

This review has a Good rating.Food selection was not as great compared to previous visits. $92++ for Friday and Saturday dinner, I do understand about weekend pricing but I was expecting perhaps some premium items. But, no. In fact, macarons have been removed from the dessert corner. And I didn't see lobster either. The sushi in the first picture was the highlight for me that night.Noted several new dessert items added to the already wide varieties dessert counter. Strangely they are not served in petite cups but huge regular cup sizes. The wafer and biscuits in the strawberry cup (see picture) has turned soggy. If you are looking for ambience, this is not a place to consider. It will be a while before I choose to return

One of the best buffet in Singapore! Really enjoyed burps with Asian and Western food choices. But chef ashok made our day really special! thank you for coming over to check if everything ok and for sharing your excellent food! thank you also to Erica? i hope its a correct name, the korean lady who served us.. she's so sweet, attentive and friendly! We will come back for sure!

We love the Shangrila Singapore and this year we stayed in the apartments, but still had breakfast at the Line. Such an amazing breakfast buffet of all different cuisines and to top it off champagne which I enjoyed with orange juice each morning. The only thing I missed was bread and butter pudding. The staff are attentive, friendly and efficient and the food sumptuous. Cant recommend it highly enough. Special mention to William and Oma
5
At $62sgd for weekday lunch, this place represents superb value. The spead is absolutely unbelievable. All manner of hot and cold food, desserts to die for and ice cream. You could even ask for free parking. A must try for all food lovers. An oh yes, the quality of the food is good as well. Much better than i had expected.2 thumbs up
5
The service is good and attentive. I did mentioned that I coming for my hubby birthday celebration and the team prepared a small surprise for my hubby.
1
Staff at The Line provide wrong information on credit card promotions and messed up our reservation and caused embarrassment to us. Wrote a feedback email to the management and to the Reservation staff and my emails had been ignored.
Really disappointing experience.
4
Recommended by Friend a Must go buffet hence gave a Try. I would said worth a try! But if there is Oyster available for lunch would be rather happy:)
5
Delicious buffet with very extensive selections of every type of food you could imagine. Beautifully presented, very clean, and very solicitous wait staff. The seating can feel a little bit crowded and clustered but otherwise a very comfortable dining experience
5
The Line offers a great diversity of food. And especially if you are a fan of desserts and sweet, this is heaven for you.
3
Was a great disappointment. Called reservation line to ask about oyster for buffet lunch and was told they served 2 types of oysters thus we went ahead to book a table for birthday celebration (My friend's craving and favourite item).Upon reaching, was told they stopped serving oysters since Feb. Only available for Sunday Brunch!! If I want it would be ala carte at $5/pc. Seriously I would have gone Marriott lunch which we are 100% sure there oysters available.
3
decided to have another try at the line after spending my birthday here several months back. i had a pretty good experience in february. came with friends for dinner. at 730pm the whole place is packed! our table was on the very far end of the room . away from the buffet spread but its still okey. not much changes actually with the food that it looks boring. the seafood spread seems popular with the crowd as the oyster plate is always empty. alaskan crab also all consumed in a matter of few minutes. settled myself with some steak and now my new favorite the singapore's laksa! thankful also for the dessert spread. yummy and nic
3
We enjoyed the meal, but maybe walked into this restaurant expecting a lot more based on the hype on the web. The food was good, but didnt differentiate from many other buffet's in town ... they did have some middle eastern flavors, which was nice to see, they had some chili crab, which is also nice. I'd encourage them to space out their tables a little, as moving around the place isnt easy. Don't get me wrong, enjoyed the meal, but had expected magic from all the web hype
5
The Line is a huge buffet with local, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian, and western food choices. The night I was there, they featured seafood including lobster, claims, oysters, Alaskan king crab.I started with a local soup, Singapore laksa which is a type of seafood soup. I then tried a local burrito like rolled food along with seafood fried rice, Singapore spicy crab (hard to eat since in it is still in its shell but it was the great tasting ), beef satay, lobster tail, and for desert some local rice cakes and awesome gelato (raspberry, mango,and a kind of Japanese lemon.The food was great. The only issue I see is that with so many choices, it could be a bit overwhelming. You do need a strategy to do their buffet. However, I enjoyed it and if the opportunity presents itself go bac
3
it was agreed as a standard in my company, to have at least one dinner in The Line, once I am in Singapor. This place was my place in heaven. Unfortunately, was... This time, I went home quite disappointed. I haven't met the excellence, I always have found before: nor in the service staff, nor in the food, nor in a cozy environment to enjoy food, friends, life. I looked like, that everyone in the team was adopted to a routine, working like robots (or labor union controlled workers :-)However, the only thing, that was like before was the price... and that is not good
4
There is new Dessert for the buffet line. However do note some contains alcohol and it is best 2 to share.
5
Buffet Line's variety was immerse. Food gets top-up fast. Staff was jovial and service was excellent.
2
Spread was not fantastic. Setting doesn't gives a 5stars environment. Seafood spread needs more work to it.
4
The line provides large array of food choices to suit everyone. However, the quality good be better.
4
Excellent variety of seafood and wine during Marine Harvest night. The service quality is also top-notched, well worthy of all the praises given to The Line thus far. Would recommend a visit for anyone looking for a good night of food and free flow wine/beer.
2
This is my first time trying the buffet after hearing alot of reviews. This is a place for varieties of food but not quality food. The lamb is fatty and tastless. The tandoori chicken is nice. There is a strong pig taste in kongpao pork. The mutton curry is bland. Tastless roasted duck and lousy roasted pork. Service is lousy. They never refill our warm water until we request for it. Will come unless I no need to pay
2
We experienced grouchy staff service from the noodle and drink counter. Noodle side was rude when asking for order. Drink counter staff was very upset with guests asking for coffee and tea. Service staffs wasn't attentive and shaking head all the time when disposing food into the bin. As for the food, The Indian Pilaf rice was soggy.
2
Disappointing experience. Could have been so good the lobster, crab, prawns were pretty cool but the atmosphere was too bright and too cafe like rather than a place for a romantic night out. The free flow prosecco was great but the service left something to be desired, could have been so much better.Satay and curries were lovely and the range was great just not as good as similar hotels
4
It has been a while since we last gone back to The LineThe spread was decent although it could have shrank a little since I was last there in terms of variety. We went for their seafood harvest night and the general quality of the seafood was good. Only minor suggestion - the oysters could have been bigger and they may want to leave the eggs intact instead of cleaning out everything
3
It wasn't really special, nothing fancy though it's at Shang Ri la , I expected better. Food quality was somewhat there but most food was cold. Seafood wasn't as fresh. Was promised an anniversary surprise on the phone but didn't get one. Overall was disappointing, and for that price, doubt I'll go back there again
4
The quality of food was good. Food was topped up regularly. The only thing is the restaurant is too crowded and stuffy.
4
Great service from the waitress. Sweet smile and warm greetings from the waitress. Food selection were limited. However, there's plenty of dessert choice. Good for sweet tooth fans.
5
We stayed in the Valley Wing but ate at The Line, the choice and quality is unsurpassed, they have everything and more. Breakfast and evening meal buffet were superb, make sure you go hungry.
3
The service staff were very friendly, but the food quality was very disappointing the oysters were waaaaaaay too salty, and the lobsters were badly overcooked. Even the roasted wagyu meat was very tough.
The sashimi and Indian food were good though.
3
Service at Shangri-La was good. Unfortunately the food did not match the service - only dessert bar was good but that would not have been worth what was paid for.
5
Pleasantly surprised by the sheer variety of selection. My kids were entertained by the ballon maker and the deserts were delightful
5
It was a birthday dinner treat for my mum and I must say we had an awesome one! The spread was impeccable and it came with free flow of champagne /wine/beer...The Chilli crab was scrumptious and we couldn't help getting yet, another serving. The herbal prawn soup was simply unforgettable too. We were spoilt for choices at the dessert section as we indulged in cakes, kueh, ice cream etc... It is my favourite buffet restaurant for now! Do remember to book online for some special discount too!
3
We had booked a reservation at Line via Chope website. However, upon arrival at the restaurant, we were informed the dinning price for that night was S$108++ instead of $79++ we saw at the point of booking. The restaurant Manager advised we should look at Shangri-la's website for the correct pricing and they cannot honour the wrong price shown at other website. There was no service recovery offered as the Manager advised we are already enjoying the 50% discount for using the Amex Card. This is not the first time we encountered incorrect pricing at Chope website. We had a similar encounter at another restaurant and the service recovery was better - the restaurant Manager at Katong Village dinning gave us a set of discount vouchers (1-1 offer) to return.See the difference in service recovery. Chope should update its pricing to reflect the current pricing of the restaurants they tied up with
4
The buffet has very fresh sashimi. (Salmon, Maguro, Swordfish, Scallops....) and oysters, lobsters, crabs & prawns.The cooked food is also varied from freshly prepared pasta to North Indian cuisine. The desert sections has really interesting gelatos which include Durian and black Sesame, sorbets which are deliciously refreshing for example the Yuzu Sorbet. Apart from the ice creams, the local deserts like cake lapis is also fairly decent.Finally, the beverage would include alcoholic drinks to juices. Be prepared to pay a steep price, but the freshness and flavour and choices would make any foodie happy
3
Food was tasty and nice presentation on the buffet spread,well done! The customer service from the waiters and waitresses were good as well. However,slight disappointment when I made through phone reservation,a staff was seen reluctant and could wait to hang up the phone with me. I did not expect this service from a 5 star hotel restaurant
5
There was a wonderful array of food to satisfy one's breakfast cravings. Staff were very attentive. 😊
4
Service was good and they provided a complimentary cake for my BD. Good variety but quality is not too good.
5
We only had breakfast here,the choice is huge.Very good quality - something for everybody.Lots of fresh fruit,smoothies,juices,danishes,cakes,eggs,bacon,asian,the list is endless.
5
Multiple cuisines, fresh food of all types, and a clean, happy atmosphere with very pleasant cheerful staff make this more than a buffet. Simply brilliant
4
Nice place to unwind, great service staff. A bit pricey for regular patronage though. Check credit card promos prior!
3
The most uncomfortable buffet lunch ever! The whole restaurant is like a mini sauna…Told the waitress about it and she said it's because of the renovation that is going on. THe food spread is good but it was simply too warm to enjoy.
4
Good selection of Intl buffetGreat Shangri La Hotel (although still in renovation mode) the restaurant remains of great stature and high qualityThese days its a bit of a feeding frenzy but a good night for a family with various cuisine desires in a relaxed environment at a higher cost
5
I was not impressed at first sight, the orange colours were not so easy on the eye and there was rather a long queue of people so it reminded me of everything I hate about a large Hotel. I thought I had made a mistake but a few short minutes of a walk around the incredible array of food was all it took to have a complete change of heart. Crowds or no crowds, orange included, this place offers a fabulous breakfast. So much choice from so many nations, and everything I tried was top quality and delicious
5
My absolute favourite buffet spot seriously, because of these reasons (and I'm a buffet lover):- American Express platinum card 50% off food bill - best when you eat as two pax for most savings. A Sunday dinner buffet comes up to $79++ for two- Wide selection of hot and cold dishes - you get different types of sashimi, fresh seafood, international cuisine (mainly western, Chinese and Indian) and so many dessert options that desserts form practically half my eating portion.- unique sections: self service frozen yogurt, ice creams, crepes, peranakan desserts, and a standalone coffee and tea corner. Teh Tarik (pulled milk tea) is a must try.- prompt service: our iced water is always topped up, plates are always cleared. Will definitely be back again! Do ask for complimentary carpark coupon if you are driving

I went here with my husband for our 4th wedding anniversary and we noted this is our comments line when we booked online. We also asked for a window seat. On arrival we were seated at what I think was the best window seat in the house and we were immediately greeted by 3 different waiters serving us drinks, pulling out our chairs and explaining the buffet. I had previously read the reviews on the food at this buffet and whilst I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion and everyone has different dining experiences I can honestly say none of the negative reviews were our experience. Without exception, every station offered fresh, delicious meals. Definitely not your typical buffet. This one is presented with such pride and thought and you just could not try everything on offer. There is a salad buffet, seafood, Japanese, noodle station, Indian, dessert, coffee, International, Asian and Dim Sum stations. My husband ate his value in Alaskan crab and prawns alone. We then wanted to move outside to have dessert, wine and a smoke and were soon accommodated under the fans in the tranquil garden settings. There the chefs had prepared us a delicious dessert with happy anniversary piped onto it. This buffet really is a must but go hungry so you can enjoy it all. The staff are very polite, quick and attentive. Go experience it. Will definitely go back
5
A great culinary treat for my wife and I. Experienced a great buffet of exquisite quality and savored the unique desserts.
5
They cater for everyone. We could not fault their selection. Great food, great ambiance and great service.
4
Very good service and good variety of food selections. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. Good for gathering.

It was a celebration for my son's birthday. Making the reservation through Chope was really easy n hassle free. Closer to that day I simply made a call to The Line n asked if they are able to present a slice of cake to make this birthday celebration special and the staff was eager to fulfill my request. As my reservation was for a Sunday, I received an email from Shangri la informing me in advance that there would be no oysters on its menu on Sundays. They also pre-empt me of their on going renovation work n gave me detail direction so as to not inconvenience us on the day of the visit. We really had a great celebration with great quality buffet spread. Though there is no oyster that day but we were well compensated with the freshness of their sashimi spread at their Japanese section. We were simply satisfied. Truly as the staff had promised, they presented a cake to my son and also sang him a well wishes birthday song. Before we left, I casually asked if they were able to give me a complimentary parking ticket and again they kindly obliged. We went home happy after a great evening dinner at The Line.
4
Upon entering and before going down the small flight of steps, the spread of food from the 16 kitchens can be seen. The food that drew our attention was the cold seafood and the extensive range of mouth watering desserts. Favourite apart from having oysters were the 'Nasi Lemak' served on chips. The giant 'Teh Tarik' cylinder was really eye catching as well. As for desserts, earl grey macaron was the best flavour to me and not to forget, they have gelato and soft serve as well. Side note, some of the chefs are really enthusiastically friendly and pose for pictures when you snap a pic of the entire station
3
Had all the "extras" that certainly made the kids happy on a Sunday brunch. From candy floss to a balloon sculpting, an excellent array of ice creams, sorbets, cakes and desserts, it was all great from that front. Sashimi was generally good but not exciting, lobsters were fresh but not as tasty compared to what I've had at other places. Oysters and crab legs were excellent. The other dishes served were generally alright. Local food was above average, except the satay. Chili crab tasted good except the crab wasn't as fresh. Not sure why. Beef selection was wide. Too bad, I do t eat beef. Chicken and pork selections pales in comparison. Highlights were the foie gras selection. Price was inclusive of drinks. Problem was they ran out of most juices within one hour. A little frustrating when you paid $108+++ per person. They had a barista so coffees and teas were all good. Service started out cold and looked understaffed but strangely improved as time wore on. First time at The Line for me and I'm sorry to say it failed to meet my expectations overall. Try harder.
2
Considering the generally perceived brand reputation of Shangri-La, this is a complete disappointment. Food - Quantity, not Quality. It's an extremely wide selection of all kinds of cuisine but the quality is POOR. Sushi is made with the wrong type of rice. Shellfish is not properly cleaned - bits of shell/sand found in them. Asian - Satay has been overgrilled till Hard! Ambience - NOISY and Crowded. Tables so close to each other that pushing your chair back will bump the diner at the next table. When you move in and out to get food, you need to navigate a path that's not blocked by diners whose chairs are pushed back. Service - the wait staff seem to be plentiful but they appear intent only on clearing plates off the tables and nothing else. And by the way, as further illustration of my point about this being a low end buffet (at a high price point), they will clear your plate but not your cutlery so you get your dirty cutlery directly on the table while you go grab another plate. We had a long while waiting to catch someone's attention (who was not busy clearing plates) to place our order from the wine list which is itself completely in line with the down market character of the place. All the diners around seem intent on eating as much as they possibly can. Most are VERY casually dressed - not that I mind that in and of itself now that I know the character of the place. So, know what to expect if you're going to eat here - low-end, mass-market buffet spread. The only thing about this place that speaks to the Shangri-La brand is its PRICE! (Note that we went there on a Saturday evening which is supposedly their busiest time)
1
Came here with great expectations for lunch with family to celebrate my son's birthday after reading and hearing good reviews from friends and the internet. However we were disappointed. There isn't a great variety of food, okay but not great compared to Hyatt and ritz. Food quality is so so. There is nothing outstanding on any of the food. I thought the spread and quality at the high tea is much better at the verandah though they are both at the same hotel. Deeply disappointed. They gave my son a birthday cake though.
5
From Dim Sum to scrambled eggs to Miso soup to waffles to shrimp/noodle soup to.... Wonderful atmosphere in in the airy, bright "hotel restaurant." Totally enjoyed the staggering array of wonderful foods. While we didn't dine here for Dinner, we saw a simply remarkable buffet display of seafood one evening: S$104.00++ per person. Looked like it was well worth it
1
One of the things I loved about Singapore was the breakfast by the pool at the Shangri La Hotel. Sadly they turned this area into an Italian Restaurant and shifter the Breakfast are away from the relaxing pool area. It now looks like a Cafeteria - no class. I went there for Dinner the other night - a buffet. Worst buffet I have ever had - I rate it 2/10. Seafood was 'tired' Salads were limp. Dim Sums consisted of 3 types with heaps of doughy buns. Nothing good to be had here and with 2 small mottles of Perrier Water a bill of S156 - what a rip off. I will never go back as this once great hotel has lost it sou
5
I and my family experienced excellent food and service in the line when we visited the restaurant. Durian cake is the best food in my opinion.
3
Sadly not longer what it used to be. It appears that they are cutting corners. for example, you can only get a piece of lobster at the noodle station. Satay is still nice. But salads now look very poor indeed.
5
Good variety and delicious dishes . Very satisfied and pleased with the service and effort of the staff. Plates were cleared promptly and staff remembering my birthday cake request when I made the reservation.
5
Celebrated Vday here with its Marine Harvest Tuesday and it came with free stalk of rose for my date. 10/10.
5
The best breakfast buffet selection, we stayed in the Shangri-La Apartments and the breakfasts were part of our package, oh my gosh what a selection of so many cultures! Absolutely fantastic - well worth staying just for the breakfast!! Very one was so happy eating plate after plate, you would have to be there for at least a week to try everything, 10/10!
4
Getting here was a bit of a hassle, it being out of the way, and the main toad behind (Stevens Road) was congested with road works. Ambience was nice, bright and clean. Staff were also attentive and worked fast to clear the plates. Food selection was wide, from Indian to Chinese to Japanese, Western and local hawker fare. Food was fresh, and taste was just right. We particularly liked the pig trotters, roasts, sashmi and desserts. As it was a birthday meal, the restaurant theew in a small cake (we were a small group of 4). Nice touch there. Price-wise, it could have been a little lower though. Overall, wonderful experience. Tip: ask for complimentary parking at the restaurant reception after paying
1
Very poor welcome at The Line if arriving without a reservation despite empty tables everywhere on a Sunday evening - rude staff. Also, asking to be sat outside but noticing that most chairs were covered in birds' droppings - nice touch!Food menu terribly boring and adding the poor welcome and complete mess of the hotel (under massive refurbishment, entire lobby is currently condemned) then this is not a place we're likely to go back to anytime soon
2
I stayed at the hotel in February and on my last night decided to see what the fuss was about because every time I passed by it was packed. I went in for dinner and wasn't impressed. The buffet had several different stations, but nothing seemed to be really hot except the corn soup. I had to ask for a soda twice and waiting over 10 minutes for the free drink to be served which was free wine or sparkling drink that night. The fruit wasn't fresh, tasted old and didn't look fresh either, some of the entrees weren't available, which is to be expected but should be replaced right away. When I checked out I noticed that it ended up costing me 127 sgd! MAN, this is not worth the price. For this amount of money, I shouldn't be given a table that was originally for someone else, wait for drinks to be served, have not fresh fruit and no hot food. I will not be going back to eat here when I return to the hotel
3
Have been having my wedding anniversary dinner at Line for many years. Always like this place for her wide spread of food, the spacious seatings and the good service. But this time the experience is a quite disappointing. The place is crowded, noisy with some crying babies and some children running around. And the oyster is missing from the dinner spread, which i find pretty unacceptable considering the price we are paying per head. But the service is still top notch. The waitress (Christine) is attentive and is constantly keeping our table clean.
4
We enjoyed a sumptuous lunch at the Line in Feb. It's been some years since our last visit. The variety of spread was as generous as I remember, and the quality is worth the price of the buffet.It's not surprising the Line still attracts the crowd and that Saturday the place was packed. Food items are replenished quickly and the attentive staff are quick to clear your table. Will definitely be back in the near futur
4
Service is good food variety is almost the same which I had 1 year ago. No oysters served which is something missing
4
The reservation is easy and confirmation were received quite fast. At the restaurant, I am happy that the staff can easily found my reservation via Chope. Environment was a bit warm....I guess was the direct sunlight coming from the roof glass.
5
In my view, this is definitely the best international buffet in Singapore. It's a great buffet with plenty of choices. We are crazy with the assortment of desserts for the sweet-toothed at the dessert section of the restaurant! Highly recommend!
4
The shangri la is a top hotel in Singapore. The line restaurant is a little bit dated and unfortunately it ressembles to much to a cantine. It certainly needs to be upgraded. It once was modern but not anymore. The food is still outstanding and choice is extensive.Price is rather high, about 100 S$ per person, drinks exclude
4
Service is excellence. Desert is very good. missing oyster but suckling pig is a surprize. Very good Atmosphere. Complementry parking is available. highly recommandation
5
The food choice was excellent and of a high quality. You could eat as healthily or as unhealthily as you liked! For a reasonable extra charge you can include free flow wine or prosecco. The ambience was bright and modern and the service good
5
We ate here a number of times. On all occasions the food was top quality and there's a hugely varied selection of very different cuisines. The shellfish is outstanding as is the sushi and the roast beef. It's a pity that the service is a bit variable. Sometimes excellent but occasionally almost non existent. As this is a buffet this didn't mar our enjoyment
2
It was a disappointing experience for me to celebrate our anniversary at The Line. We have heard so much about it but i was just over rated. For the price i am paying for, i am definitely certain that i will be able to enjoy a better quality food and service. Here are some pointers that i would love to highlight; - Well greeted by the host. Was offered an indoor seating as requested.- No oysters on the buffet line, fine, because it was already stated in the web site prior to the reservation. But the replenishment of the other cold items were really slow. Especially prawns. - There was a massive queue over at the noddle stall. Apparently only one chef juggling with both the cooking of noodles and slicing up of teh roast meat station. He has to run to and fro and i really empathize with him. However, he is very professional is any aspects especially being patience. As we all know the ugly facts that Singaporeans tends to have lots of "funny" request when come to live stations. (FYI i am a Singaporean too but i just accept was was being offered).- There is no one manning the carving station. I stood there for about 4mins to seek for attention until some one appear. - Service staffs are prompt with replenishing ice water. Awesome.- Food tags are not tallied with the items in the chafing dish. (Tandoor Station)- I requested to end our dinner with a cake(I don't mind paying) with "Happy Anniversary"wordings, but it never happen. It was meant to be a surprise for my wife.Bottom line is... I am really disappointed.I can always be reached at eg6stanley@gmail.com if you require more information.Best regard
3
Had visited for my husband's birthday but to my disappointment, no oyters were served. Unlike what was stated on the website
4
Very good buffet with plenty of choice. Live cooking stations with different International Cuisines. Quite expensive compared to Irish prices. Can get very busy
4
The lobster laksa is the killer, very very nice. The Seafood is fresh, prawn is sweet also. The dessert is fantastic good. Ice cream is wonderful
5
The Line is part of the Shangri-La group and whenever you eat there for whatever reason you eat there the the food is abundant with a great variety. You will not be dissapointed
5
Had my annual gathering with my gym kakis, variety and quality of food excellent. Will defintely return fore more
3
Sunday Brunch. I thought it was lunch, didnt expect it to be a brunch with hugher price. It came with free flow soft drinks which i only found out near the end of the buffet. Staffs didnt even bother to ask what I want. Staffs not very attentive at clearing plates. Always seems busy doing something else. Service needs to up the ant

Checked into valley wing at 1.15pm today. We were all so hungry as kids don't eat airplane food. Ordered food at the Line at 1.55pm. By 2.35 only drinks had arrived. Complained to the server that we'd just pay for the drinks and leave as afternoon tea was served in the lobby. Miraculously, food arrived 5mins later. All dishes were cold except for my kids chicken fillet. The worse was the laksa where the noodles had soaked up all the soup. Hainese chicken was tough and dry. Had to wait for the condiments 5mins later.Considering that the restaurant was definitely not busy that time, it was inexcusable that we had to wait so long for poor quality, cold food.All in all a very bad start to the holiday...we have reservations at the waterfall tonight but still debating on whether to cancel

Overall the staff are nice and friendly.. wide range of food. But they do not have oyster for this period..
5
If you had read about my earlier review on The Line, it was a disaster. And this is complimentary from the restaurant. The day we went happened to be seafood theme and had free flow of wine and less crowd. It was much more enjoyable and a pleasant experience. I had a wonderful time. This should be how an eating experience in The Line should be
4
Good varieties but due to CNY there was no oysters when we went. The seafoods were very watery, tasted frozen. But beside that, the overall experience was good. Friendly staffs

Yes, the title sums up our experience at The Line. We came here for buffet dinner on Friday evening. The price is at $92++. The restaurant is usually full, so you need to make reservation in advance. The buffet spread is huge. I liked the crab claws at the seafood section. The crab meat tasted fresh, and is firm. The prawns are good too, and you can taste the sweetness of the prawns.There is the usual Japanese sashimi section and sushi, and there is an Indian selection too. Papadum with the curries is nice. And I had the laksa, which comes with lobster meat, the laksa gravy is just nice, not too thick or watery, and it is not really spicy, so you can add on the Chilli. In the desserts section, there is good quality ice cream and a good variety of cakes too.The service staff are attentive and offer great service, and all these are important for a great dining experience
5
I booked the dinner buffet for 2 to give ourselves some me-time away from the kids.Booked my reservation through Chope- app has improved greatly through the years! I was surprised it could still have records over 3 years ago before the app was up. Recommend people to try it for restaurant bookings.Line staff was professional and gave a call a day before my reservation to confirm- and also to inform the much beloved oysters is currently unavailable. Though disappointed, we decided to proceed nonetheless.On the day itself, was a busy Friday night and we wished the staff was more attentive to our needs. That can be forgiven given the splendid spread. Great quality buffet fare, definitely there's something for everyone to enjoy!We absolutely love the lobsters at the prawn mee station and the fresh snow crab legs. A must try
5
I've been there 3 times. It won't disappointed you for sure regardless of the food choice, food quality and staff service. But the location is not that easy to access by walk, It's a bit isolated from Orchard road.
4
My wife and I enjoyed breakfast here on a couple of morning whilst on a stopover at the hotel. Fine choice of a wide range of cuisines. A breakfast here really sets you up for the day.
4
We went to The Line to try the seafood buffet dinner after an interval of 3 years.The quality and freshness has been consistently good! My plates were filled by the succulent slow roasted beef with a pink centre and beef jus, salmon belly sashimi, California hand roll, freshly shucked oysters, live prawns on ice ... these were so delectable that I do not need a wider spread! The free flow prosecco makes a perfect pairing.Our visit came with a bonus - fresh durians! Bliss
2
This hotel restaurant has absolutely nothing to recommend.itself. A truly boring and generic choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner and considering the mediocre quality of the ingredients totally overpriced. Tried to eat breakfast there while staying in the equally outdated hotel for three nights on a recent business trip because of convenience, but my wife was smarter, after the first atrocious uninspiring breakfast she ate outside at an organic place instead. On our first night we tried the seafood buffet and if one likes quantity over suality, as the majority of the unglamorous crowd seemed to do, this is a great place, but for us a waste of time and money
2
Went for a weekday lunch and was informed that outdoor seats were allocated for us (which was hot and we could see birds flying near the seats). If we choose to have indoor seats, we would have to sit on high seats- like bar tables and chairs that were not used for dining. The reason given was that the restaurant was full house, even though we made reservation close to 2 weeks earlier. Informed 2 service staff separately that we wish to change to normal seats indoors when they are available subsequently and both kept quiet and did not reply. Not a pleasant dining experience for a 5-star hotel. Food was above average.
2
The Line has been my favorite for years, a great selection of quality food. On the last visit for lunch it was so crowded that the popular food stations seemed more like a scrum line. Many popular foods were gone, the food staff could not keep up, and the result was that the visual appeal was simply not good. The hotel is undergoing renovations so the crowd was a surprise. Every table was taken inside and out. On reflection there were no stand out dishes from a taste standpoint either. They may have to take the difficult decision to turn customers away to maintain a quality experience
5
So many opinions and reviews on the LINE. I'm just doing this out of obligation.. Short conclusion:1. Live up to its reputation. Arguably the best buffet in Singapore considering its spread, quality, ambience, service and value for money. 2. Good Asian selection. 3. Extensive dessert selection too. Leave some space for it!
4
This was our 2nd visit to The Line. We recently had buffet at another hotel, and was disappointed, so wanted to right the "buffet-wrong". The Line is the right place to do that! :) Love: - freshly shucked OYSTERS! (among the cold seafood section, which has good selection & quality) - SASHIMI! and sushis (Salmon Aburi was quite nice, as were hotate gunkan & jellyfish gunkan)- Moroccan section, with decent tzatziki and hommus to accompany the nicely grilled meats - meats galore, of different cuisines (love the Indian ones, and the Chinese roasts)- good selection of salads- CHEESES!! - too many types of dessert to choose from, including ice cream and crepes!- coffee/tea included in buffet, and there are non-caffeine options!3 defining factors for me about The Line: - not too crowded such that one has to wait at long queues - popular food items were quickly topped up, to satisfy the crowd- food stations are flanked by their respective cooking/prep stations, so minimal movement of food from cooking area to serving area; and the cooks can know which items are popular and react accordinglyWe spent about 2 hours there, slowly enjoying the food, and each other's company. We didn't go for the soft drinks package ($9.90++) nor the wine package (don't know how much, but I'm not interested in their selection... save the tummy space for desserts!)Service was prompt, although somewhat erratic... but not a problem at all - tt's a buffet after all!Highly Recommended
5
The Line never fails to pleasantly surprise me with their good service. The staff were friendly to all customers though it was packed. We liked this restaurant for their delicious spread and during this visit, we were impressed with their excellent service. Keep it up, the Line team! You are doing Singapore proud with your excellent service
5
We came to the buffet at the Line last Saturday - jaw dropping - any food you could imagine - the hard thing was deciding what to eat and when to stop (you have to leave room for desert!)I thought the food quality and service were the best I have seen at a hotel buffet. Perfect for a special occasio
5
The variety was great. Food for all ages. Not only were the adults satisfied, the kids were thrilled with the pastries, ice cream and macarons.
5
The spread was incrediable and service is great too. Please use your Amex Platinum when billing for more satisfying experience lol
5
Had a very nice evening at the restaurant, brilliant seafood. Highly recommend the Prawn and Snapper.
5
Lines provide excellent food and services, that's the best buffet I ever had in Singapore, definitely will visit again!
4
Singapore signature food like satay, chicken rice, roti prata and wanton noodle. Ought to try for foreigners. Other food includes indian, Tim sum, Japanese, middle east and lots of desserts and pastry.Excellent spread in a comfortable restaurant at a premium price. We paid about $100 per pax
4
Rebecca made our dinner buffet pleasant by being attentive to our needs. She asked if we can consume alcoholic drinks (as we were celebrating our anniversary) and took note of our beverage preference. She was also quick to give us a bowl of water with lemon slices when she saw us coming back with prawns and crabs.Sushi was wonderful and fresh. Good place for seafood! I also enjoyed the Indian cuisine.There were varying choices for dessert though I would say, there were hits and misses- the sago Gula Melaka and Pandan chiffon were not that sweet or rich. I was also not a fan of the prawn noodles- a bit bland for my liking.A lovely place nonetheless- good service and you would go home feeling full :
4
A daily breakfast at The Line was part of my accommodation inclusion at the nearby Shangri-La Apartments. On this occasion I was a little disappointed as I believe it's not as good as it was last time. The service staff seemed disinterested (for 2 days I wasn't welcomed, asked for a room number or offered coffee) and the food selection was smaller, although still quite extensive.A nice place for a lazy breakfast sitting outdoors. Watch out for the coach loads of people arriving as that signals chaos and mayhem
5
Fantastic Indian and local cuisine, great desserts, yummy local coffee and tea options and fresh shell fish options. Loved their oyster bar! The only thing is that it is busy, noisy and the decor is just meh... But yum, yum, yum
4
Finally visited this restaurant after seeing a lot of reviews about it.First and foremost, the range of food is huge! I had gone to some buffets with big variety of food and this will come in tops in terms of range. So much that I didn't have the capacity to try out all the stations.The part where it particularly shined is the area where it features Middle East food. The chicken kebab was really well prepared. Succulent and tender. Am surprised that it was grilled. Thumbs up for the skill involved in preparation. Quality of food was good. Service was good too. The only thing is it is a bit less exclusive in terms of ambience. A bit chaotic as the seats are pretty close to each other. Nevertheless, a good place to enjoy a variety of food if you can't decide which cuisine to go for.
5
I had to bring a bunch of overseas friends for dinner... 2 wanted to try Singapore food, 1 preferred something simple (not feeling too well and a bit jetlagged), 1 loved spicy food and 2 others had the usual "anything will do"... and this called for THE LINE @ SHANGRI-LA Orange Grove Road!Variety, freshness, authenticity and ambience - No. 1. I would rate the Line as probably the best (in quality, variety and choice) buffet in Singapore. PLUS - all prepared and dished in front of you and not quite from the usual chaffing dishes!Parking is more than ample too! Another big plus: Great Service
5
This is a wonderful buffet presented at the Singapore Shangri-La Hotel. It's a bit pricey, but the selection is unbelieveable. If you want a reservation, you must call days ahead, but you will enjoy spending time there in culinary heaven.
4
Great food, great service by Manoj, happy I made the right call with The Line Cafe as my first champagne brunch.
3
Brought wifey to try as i wanted to 'show' her marina harvest thursday is 'much better' than Colony's buffet. How very wrong i was.Staff service is found wanting (plates not cleared fast enough, not told that fruit juices were available to order, one ala minute station was unmanned, Indian station does not seem interested to tell you the ala minute items available for order). Food was only just above average, considering the price paid. There was a group function at one corner, and they were made the place become most expensive foodcourt that night
5
The Line @ Shangri-La Hotel is remarkably great with the variety of food served for customers. There is everything you would like to eat, and you will be spoilt for choice! Furthermore, they taste GOOD. It's better to go for lunch buffet for the price but the ambience/atmosphere is slightly better for dinner
4
Very good spread of local,international and seafood choices. Typical but exceptional buffet spread . Some stations are manned by servers or cooks. Indian, Chinese ,Japanese ,, and international seafood like fresh oysters and cooked prawns are great 
4
Was here to celebrate my 6th Anniversary with my missus to an afternoon of indulgence. We made a reservation online and advised that it was our anniversary.Honestly, i did not expect anything special from indicating our anniversary but was greeted by a nice table mat, free sparkling wine and chocolates on top of a 20% discount off the bill. The discount is due to booking online, not the anniversary.Into the review proper, i have to say the service we experienced was very good. Unobtrusive staff and very friendly people made the meal an enjoyable one.The food is a mixed bag. The quality is definitely there and we enjoyed the cold cuts and seafood which were sadly not being refilled fast enough, stuff like the alaskan crab legs, lobsters and oysters specifically are being wiped out real quick as usual. The sashimi corner lacked the usual chawan mushi (steamed eggs) usually found in the corner and the fish, though fresh, was somehow less sweet. What we did enjoy was the lobster bisque, the indian food location which was great but could have been better with butter chicken addition and the desserts. The meats section is pretty good as well with an entire wagyu leg on display which is simply huge!We also enjoyed the clean environments and comfortable atmosphere where we stayed all the way till closing of lunch at 3pm.In the end, an enjoyable buffet lunch which is good value for big eaters
3
A fairly good variety of cold seafood and a huge spread of cooked food. However, it is pretty apparent that the strengths of The Line was in quantity. They had nice sushi and sashimi, but the pace of the sushi chef was incredibly slow, which cause a line to form for the sashimi (perhaps this is on purpose for reputation sake), while the diners were swift and vicious. Safe to say, I didn't really get my hands on much sashimi. Also, he had a really unpleasant disposition, and so did practically all the other kitchen staff, especially the one on the steak (which got very dried out and rubbery after over an hour into service). Service in the back needs to match up with the front, especially so when your kitchen staff interacts with customers. Either that, or scrap live stations and have it completely self serve
5
Good variety of food, fresh and delicious. This place will appeal to seafood lovers as there are freshly shucked oysters, cold crab legs, fresh sashimi, etc. Parking is ample and do watch out for credit card promotions where it will be value for money to visit with a couple of friends
1
It was overrated. Food is not as good as what i heard from reviews from friends and social media. Definately will not fo bac
3
Went for Saturday lunch buffet - the roast poultry section was very very disappointing. Both the pork and duck were all super lean and dry. Chilled seafood was passable but the size of the oysters, crabs and prawns were very small by posh hotel standards. Variety of food was quite good though with good mix of local, oriental, Japanese and Western cuisine and decent spread of desserts, crepes and ice-cream. Service of staff is ok. If you are a Golden Circle member, do make your reservations online to enjoy some discount.For the price, will consider exploring other hotel buffets
5
One of the best buffet place in singapore
Will recommend friends and family gathering
Staff are top notch
5
If seafood is your passion then this is the restaurant for you. Unlimited oysters, crayfish, crabs and prawns as well lots of different forms of hot food. We especially loved the Singapore chilli crab and of course there were all sorts of deserts to fish the meal off with. Wine was included in the price and one word sums it up...SUPURB
3
I had the pleasure to be invited to eat here, so I can not give you my opinion about the price level, since I don't know it. It was my first time I ate in such a fancy hotel, and I have to say that the setting in the Shangri La is impressive. The buffet is varied with lots to choose from. If you have guests who are very picky about their food, it's probably a good idea to bring them to the Line. I myself am not a big fan of buffets, since I think the food quality will probably not be as good as in a classical restaurant. The Line is no exception to this rule. Overall, the quality of the dishes was a bit mixed. I thought the sushi and the other seafoods were delicious, while the middle eastern section was quite disappointing. Especially the humus was below the standard you would expect. The desserts were ok, nothing out of the ordinary, but more than good enough considering you can take as much as you would like. My conclusion is that, if you want variation, the Line is your place to go. If you want more refined and unique meals, and you don't care about eating 9 different styles of food in one sitting, I would let this one slip
3
Quality of food is good, but variety is not as good. Dessert spread is not bad, with good ice cream flavors. Expensive, unless you have Amex card where one eats free.
5
This has to be the Best Service for a Buffet I have ever had anywhere. For $138 including Free Flowing Champagne, Wine or Beer, we certainly had our money's worth. The Champagne was a Veuve Clicquot. Excellent. Fresh, Bubbly and Well Chilled and our glasses were never empty. The same for my husband's beer. We ate and drank for 3 hours. The staff were friendly, professional and attentive. Always supplying fresh, linen, cutlery and even finger bowls. The array of food was staggering and even with the amount of people, there was never a queue
4
We attended the famed Sunday buffet. No qualms with the selection and quality. In fact, one of the chef's offered and cooked me fresh eggs and delivered it right to my table, even when it is not offered as part of the spread. That was a nice touch. The selection of seafood and local delicacies is very nice. I also like that there is a small Arabic selection as I enjoy this type of food and cannot find it too often in Singapore.The decor is a bit bright and dated for my liking and the restaurant is always very busy and noisy. It is a contrast to some of the other buffet's in Singapore which give you more of a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. However, that is a matter of taste and many people will not find the atmosphere an issue. Overall enjoyed it. Would give a higher rating were it not for the paper placemats, self serve coffee/tea, scratched tables and somewhat spotty clearing/waiter service. Quality of food was excellent
5
First the bad: Shangri-la is located far from the MRT and requires a bit of a walk. But if you take your time and the weather cooperates, the walk is not bad. Once there the hotel impresses. The Line is in the back next to the pool area. You can choose to sit outside for the view, but I prefer the AC and closeness to the food.Note you should try and book on-line about 1 week or more ahead, using their website, for a discount on the buffet.If you try to walk in, there is a good chance the restaurant is fully booked.On Sat lunch, the buffet without alcohol, is about SG 84. Beverage included are all sorts of coffee, tea, cappuccino, and local pulled tea. The food station is hugely varied. The highlight for me are the raw oysters chucked right there in the station.Followed by the incredibly fresh and tasty shrimp and crabs. The meat station has this ham that was very good, with fat that melts in your mouth.The desert has a wide selection, including durian cake.
1
Food quality here has plunged badly.Here's what I paid for S$108 per person:-Ice cream/crepe counter with staff having attitude problem with a snob attitude giving one word replies without giving a damn. The expression is just disgusting! Also smashed the ice cream on the crepe like mashed potato. -Teochew Steamed fish using frozen Dory? Why not the usual sea bass at least? Or snapper? Taste so fishy and not fresh at all.-Chinese roasted pork taste cold, hard like beef jerky and tasted like raw meat. -Satay is cold and hard like rubber. -Chinese fried rice taste like white rice!-Salmon Maki with tough rice!-Mediterranean section with the fish that smells and tasted like socks. -Macaroons placed in a tin sticky and squashy? Looks more like a bad display than food.Overall good quality is terrible for quite a pricey tag. Buffet at places like swissotel Merchant court has fresh and good quality food and much cheaper. I'm unlikely to revisit The Line again
4
Good spread for the buffet price, especially after the online booking discount. Great to see oysters for a lunch buffet. We got a surprise complimentary birthday cake and polaroid to go. Excellent service, although the tables were a bit too close to one another
5
Dine in for lunch on weekday. The food is excellent and selection is wide. But perhaps the restaurant is popular and the crowd is noisy that my partner and me can't have a good conversation
4
excellent and friendly service. Refills to the seafood spread were promptly made. seafood are very fresh. Deserves another visit again soon.
5
Food and service never disappointed here. Only pity was that there wasn't any macaroons on the day we visited.
4
Tried their weekday lunch buffet and it's very value for money. They have extensive range of food to choose from. Food quality is good as well. Get discounts through their website or credit card promotions. Oyster lovers should try here since its cheaper and most places do not serve oyster for lunch. Other seafood they served includes prawns, clams, mussels,crab.There's a Japanese counter which serves sashimi, handroll, sushi, cha soba. The drink station has teh tarik, freshly brewed coffee and tea. Prawn noodle and laksa is another counter which always has long queue. Chicken satay is often in high demand and it's bbq right in front of you. The dessert counter is another killer if you are on a diet. Do not miss out the ice cream station which is directly behind the cake station. Ask for a freshly made crepe wrapped with brownie and top it with your favourite scoop of ice cream.  I would say it's a fierce fight for money comparing this place and Edge@ Pan Pac. If you are a seafood or sashimi lover then this is definitely the place for you. If you are a dessert lover then Edge@Pan pan will be a better choice
4
Well, coming to reviewing of food, it's very hard for me but let me just say that the buffet spread offered by The Line by Shangri-La Hotel was really nice. There was a wide spread of food ranging from the different ethnicity group in Singapore. The stuff was very helpful and friendly and accommodate to our request very quickly like asking for another glass of wine.However, I was pretty upset by the slow refill of the seafood especially the lobster which is the key of the buffet. I had my dinner on a Tuesday night where there aren't too much people yet, the refill comes in so slowly. Other than that, the atmosphere and quality of food is really good. The price pay for is really worth it
3
Andy Worholish primary colours inside-looks, feels, sounds like a cafeteria. It' noisy. You have to queue up for coffee like at Starbucks. Salad bar not spoiled for choice. Few Western items. Water was not refilled. Table was not cleared. Service unattentive. Ok if you re hotel guests maybe but much better brunches/buffets elsewhere
5
Awesome buffet and service The icebar,cheese station, japaness cuisine and local fiod!!! Even desert!!Actually i don't like buffer but the lion was diffrent to me i will definitely come back to enjoy the meal!
5
Have brunch with my families and friends. Overall, it is the best place for brunch around Singapore so far. The strength: a lot of variety of cuisine. Western food, japanese food, chinese food, indian food. Seafood was very fresh and tastes so good. High recommended to everyone. Service was excellent. Love the drinking stall. Feels like in biology lab. And the special one was birthday cake and singing from stuff. Plus discount for online reservation. The weeakness: i couldnt really find the weekness but maybe if possible add more variety of ice creams flavour options. Definitely high recommended for kids as well. Here come a nice lady balloon sculptor, offering around table while having dessert. How nice is that ?. Packed on Sunday Brunch, better make reservation earlier and online for special discount. Happy brunch everyone !!
1
Breakfast buffet in the morning has quite a good selection of foods for the international market it serves. If you like large groups of unaccompanied men loading their plates with mountains of food and shovelling it down like pigs at the trough you will love this experience, otherwise you may find the surrounding and customers off-putting. You almost have to fight your way to the food and when you do there are people pushing to get in front of you. This is very much the basic low end of the hotel market. Mass market tourism at its worst. My advice is avoid this hotel restaurant and book somewhere else.
5
Seriously, fast if you can (2 days beforehand).This buffet spread will challenge the glutton in you. It presents almost EVERYTHING you would ever want to eat, from cold cuts to fresh seafood to hot piping local delights. And better that, they even offer champagne so you can wash all the sins away.This buffet spread will leave you full for days after your feast. All the good food spread across the numerous stations offering the best that your heart desires.You must eat at The Line. Challenge yourself to try everything on the menu, and go for seconds if you must. Be it a celebration, or just a meal you want to spoil yourself with, this is THE PLACE to be. Get in line and book a table at THE LINE now! Seriously, come with loose pants and baggy dress cos you're gonna grow after this meal
5
Each time we have visited Singapore, we have made time to have brunch at the Line. The choices of foods from every type of cuisine is unbelievable, and the service is outstanding. Certainly worth a visit - note that the buffet is only available on weekends
5
Was our first time patronizing buffet at the Line. Buffet spread was incredible. Valued for money. Free flow of Seafood and Sashimi. This place serve fresh oysters, and various selection of seafood. For hot dishes, lamb, beef, and satay made available. The dessert here was really good. Will be back again next time
2
Visited this restaurant on a Sunday night for dinner buffet and I was not satisfied at all. Stayed in Singapore for 5 days and that was the first time I had any disastrous food. Being an Indian I always try other cuisines, but highlight of that was the Indian cuisine. All the other cuisines were just ok. With too much expectations on the black pepper crab that I had just tasted 2 days back in a hawker stall I was really excited to see it the buffet menu and dived straight in. But on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate that crab around 5. The real disaster were the desserts. Being a medical student, I know the taste of food available in hospitals. Believe me, the Danish roll, and the softie available there were so out of balance that one bite put my taste buds into a terrible state. My all time favourite is the chocolava cake. I always thought no one could ruin that. But take a guess, these guesses did ruin it. That being said, the chocolate truffle was one of the best I had eaten in Singapore. Overall too pricy buffet for such a kind of food. I would say food for the patients.
5
My most favorite buffet venues for lunch or dinner either with friends or family. I had visited this place since I first lived in Singapore in the year 1999.I first came to this place to celebrate the new year countdown to the year 2000. In the span of 16 long years I still enjoy coming back here to endulge myself on their sumptous food arrays. Their lobsters, oysters and prawns are to die for. Just with Appetizers alone I am already well spoiled in here. I love the bright set up of the place making it more vibrant either day or night. Comfortable seating areas,great food for its reasonable price, polite and accomodating staffs. What else can I ask for ? Highly recommended 
4
There were many good reviews over the Line's buffet selection and range of cuisines. However, my recent visit two weeks ago proved otherwise. The local food fest they are promoting did not impressed me. I even had a burger which the patty was not cooked through and was chewy. An improvisation of our local oyster egg failed in its attempt as oyster need to be cooked with the omelette, not just sprinkle some fried egg shards on raw oyster. Event he durian that was highly promoted failed to impress and was overly controlled. Not a pleasant experience to enjoy a buffet especially it is Shangrila
3
We went togther with our company together. The cod fish were very salty. At the indian cuisines, the tandoori and fish were equally salty. The satays they only gave out 5 to 6 sticks in once only. The chef would wait for the customer to go away after taking three or more sticks before handling out some more if there are. The chef actually took out the 5 sticks on the bbq after the one in front of me left and these fives sticks were overcooked. I declined to take these five sticks and the chef waived at me to take and i told him "burnt". After which he reluctantly took out the last 5 from the bbq stove and these were cooked with soot. (other buffet the chef just made and leave it for customers to help themselves to the food and prepared at intervals.) At the western cuisines, the thin crust cheese pizza i took a bite and throw it away. Compared to pizze hut and canadian i would rate it 3/10. My colleague said the oysters were fresh? (I dont eat raw food) but it came out quite slow. It was lunch and hence no alaska crabs. The cold crab looks miserable so i did not eat any seafood. At the Japanese sushi, i was surprise to find no unagi at all As most of the buffet i ate most had generous amount of bbq unagi for eating. The laksa i did not try it looks more like curry to me. I could not find any fresh vegetable at the salad stall. The orange pumpkin soup was also sour and salty. I like pumpkin soup however and the second pot was sweet and sour. The best was only the durian coconut cake and the raspberry cheese cake which i ate two each. The ice cream was hand made. I tried the hazenut and it tasted cheap not rich ice cream not at all comparable to hagen dazs or even magnum. The strawberry ice cream was like sherbet and i throw both scopes away. Overall my comment is this restaurant is not a generous at all. No value for MONEY at all. The auntie kept topping water and at one instant topped up my cup with hot water instead of warm water. Good grief i was careful with the water. Gotta Beware for little kids. one more thing i dont like her to touch and shift my cup when i am eating. Problem is both the plates collectors and water are served by the same group of people. Should have ask waitress to serve eater instead. My colleagues who ate there many times said the standard dropped a lot, Today. 25th April, Monday 2016. A bad experience. Shall never ever recommend

It has been a while since I revisited Shangri la for dining. It used to be the 'IT' place until poor service (due to massive crowd it is attracting), and poor quality was starting to be a norm.Love dining privilege is partnering Shangri La as one of its offering. The Line buffet was included. I was attracted by the Local Fare special (in conjunction with Singapore National day). They were offering Durians, Chendols, and tropical fruits as an addition to the massive spread. 2 pax diners get 50% off. Went on the 14th Aug, Sunday - which is $78 ++ per pax. Frstly, the seafood spread includes oysters, crabs, prawn etc. They looked fresh and constantly topped up. Japanese counter offered a fair selection of sashimi and sushi. Looked fresh and tasted fine. The rest of the cooked food looked much better than it tastes. Either too salty or bland. The best I had was satay (but the gravy was very spicy, which is different from the usual peanut sauce that is fragrant and sweet) At the drinks counter, I asked for a teh Tarik with less sugar, the guy mixing it said ok and then he poured the tea from a flask - which obviously wasn't less sweet as it was pre mixed. I asked him and he said they are all pre mixed.... And took the order from the next customer in line.... This certainly wasn't the norm, the previous visit, I can tailor the tea or local coffee to my preference... If the counter was busy, I might have relented, but the queue had less than 3 person in total.. I left with my tea barely touched as it was way too sweet.Next, on the durians, customers were not allowed to bring them into the main dining hall. But they setup some tables outside. The variety was ok with at least 4 types of durians available. Taste was not too bad. Chef was obviously busy with customers crowding him constantly. But he remain cool and professional. At 78++ for 2 pax with the discount, it is cheap. But it didn't change much of my impression for Shangri La. The days of its glory is long gone. Service standard has dropped (a constant trend) and food is mediocre at best

Firstly I maybe biased as I hate buffets. Nevertheless, I love Singapore and Malaysia street food and that's the average score for street food. Everything is ok, not bad but as a local, I much rather have street food at places they are known for the best Hainanese chicken rice etc. you get what I mean. So if u r a tourist who doesn't mind average street food pls come to the line; otherwise, go to the hawkers who are well known for their specific dishes

Food and service there was as usual top of the line. Variety was great and ever changing menu always surpises you.

Super impressive buffet, including a fresh seafood section, sushi bar, salad bar, custom-made popiahs, western seafood section, dim sum, asian seafood (such as chili crab, lobster dish, tum yum soup, etc), noodle bar, indian food section, drink bar, a wall of desserts, and an ice cream/frozen yogurt bar. It was all quite good, but we thought the asian selections were the best. Even the salads were good. Come hungry. Very hungry. And stay a long time.

As a part of shangri la this is a place that maintains its reputation. The food is excellent the variety unbelievable and the refilling of food spontaneous.Go with a fully empty stomach as you need all the space to tuck into everything that is on offer.Practically all cuisines covered. The dessert Station to die for.Go early as place gets crowded .The place is extremely atmospheric
5
Teh tarik on request? sign me up! the food was exceptional and we loved the variety available! Definitely worth re-visits!
4
Wide spread of food. From sashimi to indian food. But taste so so.think could be better. Dun really think I will come back again. A bit overpriced
4
Had a dinner there with friends. Their seafood are very fresh. The dessert & pastries are great! Had many variety of food to choose from.
4
The line really lived up to its reputation as being one of Singapore's best buffet restaurant with endless station of food. There was even a "live" durian station. Everything was good, the only complain was that the Alaskan crab was bland, probably over-boiled which is such a waste. The durians were also not of the best quality
4
This is a fantastic buffet. Incredibly relaxed atmosphere and lovely array of food on offer. Sadly I was ill when we attended so I couldn't make the most of it, but everything was cooked to a high quality and staff were attentive. Would definitely go back
5
Amazing experience for all the family. We went as a group of 6 (3 adults + 3 children) and found that the 'buffet' catered for all. The spread of food was huge and ranged from curry to seafood to sushi. Set in the Shrangri-La hotel, the atmosphere was relaxed.The service was second to none and the whole restaurant was very well organised. Overall, we found The Line a fantastic place with great service food and would recommend to anyone visting Singapore as a 'must visit' restaurant
4
Went for Lunch yesterday. Lots of variety. Very good satay. Quite yummy roast beef. Ham not bad too. Ice creams very good. Dim Sum poor, as usual. Cakes are ok, but can be improved upon with better quality ingredients. Like, the chocolate for example. It's a bit noisy. But for $62++, a very good value. Overall, the food is of a high quality
4
The line restaurant has one of the best buffet spread in Singapore. The food range from international to local with many live stations. Good doesn't run out like other buffet line. Patrons has supplies of Oysters, Sashimi, Alaska King Crab etc..The North Indian cuisine is exceptionally good. A good place to satisfy your palate.
4
The buffet is as good a food as you would get in most 1 hat restaurants.The big difference is the variety and the opportunity to taste different foods from different cuisines - all done first class.Typical of the Shangri-la - everything is done in style.
5
If you're looking for a feast, this is the place to go. You can find every sort of cuisine here, from Western to local to Indian and many many more. The spread is one of the best out there. There is also a wide variety of dessert on offer, with frozen yoghurt, ice cream and ice cream potong all being offered on top of the usual cakes and kuehs. Of course, the price is on the high side. Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached
5
My wife and I went for the breakfast buffet. It's certainly the best in Singapore and probably the world. Everything from multiple cooked to order local and western fare to the best varieties of fruit and pastries I've ever seen.
5
the spread of cuisine that you do not know how to start and how to end. Simply one of the best.
Although there was a crowd, the staff think serving you to the best. Good to try out the buffet spread.
5
Very elaborate variety buffet both at Breakfast and Lunch. Very cuisines, including some Halal options as well. The Sushi and the Japanese corner is excellent.
5
The Line is definitely one of the best buffets in Singapore The food quality are excellent for buffet, seafood are fresh and the desserts are just awesome! Great service crew as well.
4
Very wide and diverse spread of food options to satisfy many different tastes and preferences. Be sure to save some room for dessert...
5
The Oyster was so nice that the staff can't open the oyster in time to serve the crowd.
Prawn is very Fresh.
Service staff was helpful.
4
This review pertains to the free flow champagne buffet that they offer on Sundays only. The variety of what was on offer is simply breathtaking. Everything from Alaskan crab legs to lobsters, from prime rib to curry and literally everything in between. A cheese board offering the likes of which I've never seen. Everything beautifully presented, very tasty. However, the service for most is simply awful. Waiters who don't understand or speak English, slap dash and very forgetful when you found one who did. Not something you'd expect from a hotel of this repute and category. The toilets it must be said were also a disgrace
4
Food quality and spread are good. Great that a restaurant located in a hotel offers local delights such as laksa, prawn noodles and teh tarik with good standard. Decor and ambience are rather mass-market so if you are looking for a romantic place, it is not the place for you. Book online for 15% discount. You can also arrange for a private party here with your guests enjoying the buffet; the staff's attention and service are impeccable
5
Its been a while since I paid a visit to the Line and decided to have my husband's birthday dinner here, and it was indeed great!Customer Service was wonderful from the moment i exchanged emails in regards to personalising a small cake (complimentary too!), and it was even better on the day itself.They have set up a special table for the birthday and staff was knowledgeable and friendly. They also explained to us the various food and drinks available on the day.We were lucky to come by on the Thursday Seafood Harvest. It was accompanied with free flow of beer, wines, soft drinks and juices. Food selection were of course wonderful, with a spread of various selections. Dessert selection was also great with awesomely made Lava Cake. The restaurant was also beautifully set up (with option of indoor or outdoor), clean and definitely a great place for a dinner.Highly recommended to all.
4
The Line - a wide array of selections but not as extensive nor "the largest buffet in town" as what most reviewers have claimed it to be. The usual offering of:-Seafood on ice (ok, my prawns were overdone and not peeling off easily), Sushi counters - beats me why this very popular counter is situated in such a tight and narrow area, making it congested all the time,Bread, salads, cold cuts, cheese, foie gras terrine (very well done),Asian dishes, which dominated the large spread, including noodle stations, Indian fare, satay, etc.,Carvery - roast beef was surprisingly the only dish on offer but was top grade and sumptuous,Western dishes - there simply weren't enough dishes in this category and the lamb cutlet was so dry and overcooked; it's committing a culinary crime to even serve it,Desserts - the usual suspects plus a huge variety of ice cream flavours.Drinks cost separate though there was teh tarik and coffee at the buffet station.Lively, actually more like noisy akin to a market place, even on a weekday evening. Setting is definitely bright and modern, not classy or elegant. Overall, as a buffet, the food was delectable and the quality commendable (with the exception of the lamb I had). However, I did not find it any different from other top buffets in similar hotels in Singapore, except for its slightly more expensive price at $79 and I do not think the extra $10 or so is justified
5
Pretty much any food you want to eat. Delightful staff. Loved the fresh juices and the omlet bar. Worth the visit.
5
Had business gathering buffet lunch. Varieties of food were taste excellent and fresh. Will visit again either business or family lunch/dinner.

The staff was slow to take away emptied plates and in replenishing water. The restaurant should have enough staff to meet the required level of service. As usual, the place was too noisy and it was hard to carry on a conversation with people on the same table. The queue to the sushi/sashimi was too disorganized, where people just jumped in from any direction. Management should have some kind of system in place for this popular food section. There were some inconsiderate customers that stuffed their whole plate with all the oysters and crabs at one go rather than taking just enough to leave for other guests in the queue. One suggestion is to have a staff member to give oysters/ crabs in a more equitable way, so that those behind the queue will still have some while the replenishments come out. The food was ok, the satays, indian section (prawn massala, tandoori, curries) were good. The Line has stopped offering the chocolate fondue and macaroons in my most recent visit. The meat carvery and kebab section was ok. The dimsum standard has dropped a LOT - stay away from this
4
This restaurant has everything, good ambience, nice food & good service. Though not the best value for money if you are a vegetarian as most of the dishes are non vegetarian
5
One of the very best buffet restaurant in Singapore that has much option to select from. The seafood is exceptionally fresh and the variety of other foods are exceptional wide and delicious. One MUST try at least once to realised the buffet variety and the quality food
3
This restaurant is so noisy whether at breakfast or dinner, it is certainly not the place for a quiet relaxing meal.The food selection was not good for western taste, and the dinner selection not as diverse as one would expect for the price. Feel it is not value for money as you could not possibly eat as much as it costs or anywhere near it for food that was ordinary. Service is not consistent, though sometimes when quieter the service improves.Would not recommend or attend again
5
This restaurant is quite different. It is huge and very busy - booking is essential. It is a buffet, but nothing like you will have seen before. Vast range of different stations covering virtually all tastes. Go on a Thursday - seafood - and you get lobster and all the rest with complimentary wines, beers and soft drinks. Remember this place is busy, so don't expect dim lights and candles. Quite excellent however
5
Had the most wonderful time with amazing food variety and quality. Service in clearing our plates and refill of drinks were very prompt. Found the fresh seafoods the best I've had so far from all my hotel buffet visits. Price was abit steep, but definitely worth it. Would definitely be back
3
I have been to The Line several times. It was not as good as before. The food was sub par although there was a wide variety of food
5
An excellent spread which covers many different food types including Japanese,Indian and western. This would be a great venue for a relaxed breakfast for family and friends there was even some bubbly on hand so you could make a bucks fizz, all the food was fresh and the service was attentive. The only thing i thought was that the bacon provided could have been of a better quality
4
Lovely time overall, excellent service.
Food quality was good although variety could be improved.
Enjoyed our first visit!
3
Disappointed with the food. Many food are not refill or no stock (chicken satay). It is not worth paying that amount for that kind of food served.
4
We'd dined at Line for my husband's birthday and the spread was massive! Even though we came prepared with big appetites we simply couldn't try everything and had to re-strategise upon reaching, haha! There's all kinds of food to indulge in from Sashimi to Arabic. The macarons and homemade ice creams are worth saving some room for
4
Many varieties of food. Desserts were fantastic. Seafood fresh. Drinks included coffee and varieties of tea. Teh Tarik was lukewarm which could have been better. Durian roll was not refilled when close to end of buffet. Overall a nice experience at The Line!
4
Our kids love this place, and there's something for everyone. From fresh seafood - excellent Alaskan crab, prawns, fresh shucked oysters, to local Indian, Malaysian, Chinese, and specialties like Singapore Laksa, to Western so think roasts and meat carvery. All fresh and tasty.We went for dinner on a Thursday with free flow soft drinks, wine, sparkling (not champagne obviously) and beer which included some European brands.Service was excellent with constant clearing of dirty dishes, new cutlery brought to the table and drinks topped up, all without asking.All in all, great value, and lot's of fun with the family. Recommended. And we'll be back next birthday.P.S. free parking downstairs - just have ask for a voucher. Book online for 15% discount
4
Fantastic place for dinner. Great service and atmosphere overall. Good variety of food. Pastry is a must.
4
Massive variety for breakfast which made mornings excellent. However, one or two issues over the week detracted from a 5-star experience- under cooked sausages on one day, no plain yoghurt on another, the egg-station lady being slow but overall a good breakfast buffet.
5
Best buffet in town! It has a bit of everything and anything you can think of. Tons of dessert to choose from which is a favourite. There are many ice cream flavours too!Drink station for hot beverages both local and your usual coffee variations, latte, cappuccino etc, different teas and more!There is fresh seafood, salad, western, japanese, chinese, indian and so much more!If you book online in advance you may be able to get a discount.
5
Couldn't be bothered going out for a meal so decided to try the buffet in hotel. Incredible!Staff were very obliging, the food was plentiful and stocked regularly and very well cooked/prepared. Will keep coming back and definitely recommend. The meats, cuisine options are global. Fantastic!!
4
We cannot give a 5 stars to a restaurant that in the end offers you a buffet.But what is fascinating is that you can span the 4 continents when it comes to food.The staff is very efficient and kind.I like this place very much also because I had there my best breakfasts.Once finished a few meters and then you are in the Shangri-La pool area
4
Went to The Line for breakfast each morning and was astounded as to the choice and variety available. Whether you were looking for a Western, Asian, Continental or full buffet breakfast it was all laid out.
5
very nice and high standatd ever. I would like to recommend my friends and would like to go there again.
3
Service staff could have been more attentive & not pretend not to see you. Food was great, variety was more than expected.
5
Had a enjoyable dinner and surprise from the staffs with the birthday cake for my hubby.
Overall, 👍🏻!
5
Must try his noodle. Pride in his cooking. Brighten up your day.
He mixes the sauce very well and very accommodating.
An asset to the organization.
5
As usual the spread is endless. Cold dish like oysters, prawns were great. Satays with pineapple paste yummy. Fruits n ice cream were not to be missed. I enjoyed with the whole group. Awesome.....
4
I dined here for dinner last week with a group of work colleagues. The variety of food is huge with seafood, sushi, Indian, Chinese, and Western dishes. Our entire table was particularly impressed with the seafood quality (crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, and shrimp) and the noodle soup bar (we all enjoyed the Singaporean laksa). The sushi and sashimi were fresh with a sushi chef constantly cutting and rolling more. While a bit more expensive than other hotel buffets, the quality was well worth it. We also received a special discount in celebration of the Shangri-La's 45th anniversary
5
The breakfast spread is big with a lot of options for vegetarians as well. You will also find Indian items like paranthas, Upma, Uttapam etc in breakfast. There's a separate coffee booth offering a variety, they were too mild for my taste as i like strong coffees. Bakery was plenty with a separate gluten free section. Ample variety in fresh cut fruits and juices, egg items etc. Staff is very alert and friendly. One of the best breakfast spreads I have had
4
This is a very busy restaurant with loads of choices. The buffet dinner is enormous. There is just so much to choose from its quite amazing. The staff are pleasant and helpful. I did feel the buffet was expensive. Breakfast can be very busy so you may have to wait for a table
5
Excellent service from the staff....Very good, fresh and great variety of food to choose. The spread of food is so great that you will not be able to try all the variety...very fresh oyster and delicious sushi and countless of Singapore local food as well. we were very surprise when 2 of our friends birthday fall on April and when we told the staff about it, they were presented with the in house cake for them to take home...wow such a great gesture.It's cafe surrounding view is beautiful too with a pool view
4
The Line restaurant is great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The a la carte menu offers a wide range of international cuisine.
5
We had complimentary breakfast at The Line as part of the staycation package. The selection of juices, beverage to food is amazing. Everybody helped themselves to something they like or find comforting.
5
Most amazing selection of top-quality food available as a buffet. Western, Indian, Chinese, Malaysian. Excellent sea food, with huge prawns, clams, mussels and oysters. It's not cheap (about $78) but well worth it.
4
Typical Asian breakfast buffet with nice selection of Asia and Western choices. Nice pastries, fruit, egg dishes. Bright and sunny area, very clean and well organized.
5
Good selection of all types of food. We especially enjoyed the indian corner where they served prata and vegetarian curry.
4
More food than you could imagine at the Sunday buffet lunch here. Great seafood and sushi. Make sure you arrive HUNGRY! Lots of options and all are delicious.Is great for large groups
4
My family has been patronising The Line for years. We like its live station and fresh seafood. During our recent trips, we noted the oyster quality is not as good as before. Upon feedback to the management, the quality seems to improve :-)) Attentive staff despite their busy schedule
5
This is the hotel's own dining room. Morning and evening there is a buffet service.So the quality depends on the standard of the food.No problem, other than the journey of discovery. If it isn't here then it probably does not exist. Now we are not talking cordon blue, but the offerings are high quaity dishes from around the world A kaleidoscope of choices to please the pallet. If you get around them all you will have stayed for at least a week
5
Ate here on our first night it was a buffet type evening meal and it was fabulous never seen so many different dishes from all over the world my favourite had to be the fish with lobster, crab mussels scallops prawns absolutely delicious just had to go again on our second night and try all the different curries on offer
5
The variety of food is amazing!The seafood is very fresh although i did not try the oysters, my hubby commented they're not really up to his expectations.My favourite is the salmon cooked with cream sauce... absolutely delicious.Rest of the buffet include the usual sashima fare, western food, indian food etcThe desserts were cut in thoughtful small portions so that i can try more variety.Cakes can be more moist though.. did not find any durian desserts sigh.Has a hot drinks sections where i ordered my camomile tea and it was lovely :
4
Not much to say except that it's really good. Tad expensive and mainly for visitors rather than locals. V gd though
3
I did not care for the line, the food was above average but the setting was like a cafeteria. The service was marginal and rushed, very chaotic.
5
We have had breakfast as well as dinner at the Line restaurant and we would have to say that the food is amazing. For dinner there is a huge range of international dishes cooked to perfection by amazing chefs, buffet style. The desserts are to die for and they are only small portions so it's nice to sample a few. The breakfasts are also very nice and I would say it is the best place to have breakfast in Singapore! The staff are very attentive to your every whim
5
We had the buffet breakfast included as part of our stay at the Shangri la Apartments. The choices are endless and the quality of the food was first class every day. Staff are more than willing to assist and always cleaning your table in readiness for the next round of food. Highly recommended
4
One of the best hotel buffets around town, I always look forward to indulging in their fresh seafood specially oysters, salads, sashimis and cheese. The only thing I never liked in their buffet I must say is the Chinese food. I hope they can work on this one as they usually have a wonderful spread, but it always baffles me that their Chinese food selection tastes blah in most cases. P.s.Never ever miss their dessert selection, specially the vanilla pudding
5
This is it folks I have seen the changes here from 1977, the original rose garden restaraunt to the present incarnation. I have eaten here many times over the years and yes they do it so Well! The mix and fusion of all the cuisines seems to be perfectly married with efficient waiting staff who ensure that your dining experience is not only enjoyable but memorable as well.There is a mix, family groups, the retired couple enjoying their leasurly meal over a nice white wine. Then you have people like me, the business person dining alone! Do I feel awkward or lonely, not really as I am here to enjoy the food and the atmosphere.My eyes are way to Big here, because the choices are just so many, I always start of with some beautiful fresh seafood and yes it is really fresh! my real weakness, my passion is Chinese and Japanese cuisine. Hey I am Italian but I just like the lightness of the steamed dum sum, the pork bun which almost floats off your plate in its lightness. I stay away from the vast array of roasted meats, not my thing. Give me roast duck or spicy book Chou with a hint of sesame oil, garlic and of course the chilli. If you get the chance you must try The Line, it's a brilliant concept which works exceptionally well
3
If you like cheese with crackers and the occasional fruits, this is the place to get your fix. They have a wide variety of cheeses and accompaniments that are endless. However, most of the other cuisines were a let down. Indian food corner was good. The meat and seafood selections were mediocre. One plus would be the tea bar where you get to select different types of tea which were pretty good quality. I would probably not go back anytime soon but overall it's a good place for an intimate family gathering
5
When staying at the Shangri La Hotel you cannot miss The Line. actually if you wish you can spend the entire day there having Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner... What is impressive of the place is the variety of food that can bring you in different places across the planet. Yes, it is a self service buffet but what an astounding buffet. You must try it.
4
On arrival we were shown to our table, sat down, and that was it. There was no explanation of how to order drinks (it turns out tea, coffee & water are all free flowing...I'm still unsure if you are able to order anything else!) or any indication of what was on offer. But once we oriented ourselves there selection on offer was extremely impressive! A bit more vegetarian selection would be great, but with such an impressive cheese & dessert counter I definitely got my money's worth. Overall, the food and location were good, but neither felt quite luxury enough for the price.
4
Lots of different food stations, asia food, noodles rice meats. Fruits, cakes. A bit to busy for me and over whelming. you can sit outside and eat which is really nice to sit near to the pool. just be warned that if you leave your table to get a napkin, the birds will have eaten every thing when you get back.
4
We ate dinner which provided a wide range of buffet options to suit all tastes and you could also choose from a set menu if you really didn't like what was on offer. Similarly breakfast caters for all tastes too.
4
Food is great. Wish they had more options other than Asian food though. But food was great ! Also wish they had someone at reception all the time.
4
Very prompt service. Good atmosphere.
Various selections, including Western, Japanese, Cantonese, Malay, Chinese, and local cuisine. Accompanied with awesome deserts and good coffee!
Must try the chocolate with soya vanilla source!
4
We aet here one night whilst staying at the Shangri La, it is good quality, not so good service & expensive.
5
My first time in the hotel so a very pleasant surprise to be taken here. Despite no booking and it being fairly busy we were seated quickly (I was told that weekends are must to reserve) and the staff took our drinks orders and returned promptly. I was then given a tour of the assorted station and everything looked fantastic and fresh. The seafood station is incredible and worth the entry fee alone with sushi, crab and oysters just a few things on available. I started gently with salt and it was so crisp and fresh it started the meal perfectly. I then moved on to the Indian food station and the everything was fantastic with a truly fantastic blend of spices. I then tried the roast beef which was soft and tender followed by the best selection of cheeses I have seen is Singapore outside of an expensive delicatessen. Unfortunately this left no room for dessert but they all looked wonderful and will be on my list when I return. Truly a fantastic experience
5
IN all fairness, this was included with our group for breakfast and lunch, so I can not equate the value to the quality. But with that said, the selection and quality was excellent. Breakfast had variety from many cultures, and overall was very good. Lunch was over the top with everything from sushi, to salads, to carving stations. really good food and almost to attentive service. (cleared plates about 4 seconds after you were done) overall very good and I would recommend this place.
4
The Line is one of the best places for an evening buffet. The selection is wide and am sure you will find something you will really like. Just to taste everything will get your full already so, be choiceful even at the start and save space for desserts.I typically go for the Japanese section and the seafood section :
4
Lovely, bright well designed place. I'm unsure if there was a shortage of staff but it did take a lot of time to get our used dishes collected and same problem to have a new round of drinks.Most of the food was tasty, but we felt the Indian dishes could have had more of a kick / chili to make them medium intensity.I'm not into Sushi, but my guests spoke highly of their choices, which is great.That said, we did well and truly enjoy access to different foods to suit us individually. Naturally, the lady delighted herself with the deserts!The ambiance was lovely, despite the huge number of people there, which was a pleasant surprise.Its a personal opinion, but this would not be a place I take a lady for a romantic meal, but it was good for a group of people to enjoy a huge choice of foods. Enjo
5
Clearly a very busy restaurant for breakfast. Some longish queues waiting for a table at times but very efficiently managed. The food variety is extensive to satisfy all national tastes. The environment is great for people watching. The dÃ©cor colours are certainly bright and the outlook to the pool area is captured if on that side of the restaurant
5
A bit pricey than other places in Singapore but definitely the best buffet place in Singapore. Huge range of salads, mains, Asian, Western and local dishes, always fresh seafood and sushi. The ostyers are always great! Outside seating is next to swimming pool, so you can be relaxed after great dinner.
3
The service is slow. Many choices but not varieties. Especially vegetarian selection is limited. limited Wifi.
5
Beautifully arranged buffet offering food stations from around the world. Something for everyone - you may want to start off slow so you can try more options
4
Very good Hotel large pool ,Gym. Range of restaurants, big buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This is not a cheap Hotel but is in line with the 5 star hotels in Singapore
4
I am not a big buffet person, but this buffet was different from others...there was Western and Eastern cuisine.....a first among those I have visited. Very good.
5
Excellent food selection, great place to hang out. If you want alcohol, opt for the buffet and you will not regret the free flow selection which pretty much rocks.
4
Always the highlight of our day when we had breakfast at the Line. The staff were friendly, and professional.
5
Ushered onto a table at once , offered coffee immediately .
Excellent smorgasboard choice of food and wonderful dim sims .
5
We had a great time celebratinh our anniversary at shangrila (the line), all the food has a distinct taste that we will never forget..it was so memorable. From appetizer up to their dessert is really satisfying! Me and my husband cant wait to come back to this place! Thumbs up
4
Third time coming to the line. The food was fresh and there was a wide selection for seafood and international buffet. It was Valentine day eve, hence there was a huge crowd. The staff were overwhelmed. It was hard to get someone to refill the ice water. The staff were clearly busy and was not as approachable as previous visit
5
The Line is the main restaurant a the Shangri-La and has a huge breakfast and dinner buffet. There is a food station for almost every cuisine you could think of, and the food quality is excellent. The restaurant can get very busy, so make sure you book ahead of time for dinners
5
It's always good at the Line! Fresh oysters, king crab legs, prawns, mussels and scallops followed by sushi and sashimi, then a selection of cheeses and a salad. Next course was some roast beef, pork, etc. All the food is superb.
5
the food was very good and the selection impressive, very good overall experience due to highly attentive staff. great value for online booking entitled some discounts
4
We had breakfast here one morning and found the selection to be extensive. I especially liked the fried rice. I know, unusual for breakfast, but very good.
3
My wife and I usually have Dinner at the Line Buffet whenever in SingaporeIt used to be the best. Well and truly lost its crown.Visited last Tuesday for the special BBQ which was an addition to the normal Buffett.S$108 ++ included free flowing wines,sparkling wine and beersAbsolutely no problem with the service great as usual.The cold seafood was well up to standard as were the other normal offerings.The BBQ !!! Back to the drawing board on this one Lobster so tough it was inedible and Lamb chops the same.Not at all enjoyable 
5
The breakfast in the Line Restaurant was included in our bed and breakfast stay at the Shangri-La Hotel, After a good breakfast here, there is no need to eat again until your evening meal. This is probably the best buffet restaurant we have ever been to as the choice of food is outstanding.The service is excellent, and as I said in my review of the hotel, they even taught me how to use the chopsticks.You can get anything from cereal to noodles, or fruit to pastries, which made us both very happy.Thank you for giving us a wonderful experience at breakfast and we will see you all again very soon.Best WishesSharon & Jaso
5
Amongst the many hotel buffet restaurants in Singapore, The Line stands out for its vast, fresh selection of cuisines. Our favorite is the Indian section, the tandoori lamb is epic. Then, we overdosed with dessert, which simply are irresistible. Highly recommended if you are looking for good quality, but do go very hungry
4
We breakfasted at the line several times and the kids loved it. There is loads of choice and I think this breakfast buffet is one of the best if not the best I have encountered. They have Indian, Chinese, Western and Continental offerings, all at a high standard. My only criticism is that it gets quite crowded at wekends and it can be difficult to flag someonee down for a coffee
5
This restaurant is set up with 16 different kitchen sections. It really is worth the $. You can be as healthy or naughty as you wish. All tastes are catered for. From great Asian to Japanese sashimi. Waffles and indian tandoori chicken. May seem pricey but well worth it. Go hungry!!!!!!!!!!
4
A Huge and Wide variety of international food , however , the oysters and the sashimi were not very fresh on the day i visited . Good Value for those that eats alot . Love the duck and the truffle mash ! Good service thoug
5
a bit disappointment to the kids since there is no order-to-cook pasta station. the staff tending the barbecue station seemed understaffed. we had to stand there until one of the staff at the back or on the other side of station to notice and serve us. somewhat overpriced compared to other hotel buffets in town. but, overall, still a nice dining experience
3
There are so many items that you will never be able to try half the dishes on offer.
Good value for big eaters.
Food quality is average.
Service is good.
5
Good dining experience. Spread was huge and good! A relax place for gathering. Simply not enough time to savour all food items.
5
If you have time on your hands, a trip to The Line is very worthwhile. It has an extraordinary array of delicious food from multiple cuisines, and you can sit outside near the pool and enjoy the food as well as the garden.

My family goes to this buffet every time we visit Singapore. This last visit will probably be our last as the quality and selection of the buffet, and the service has declined over the years. The sashimi and seafood area is still good but everything else not so much. There used to be a make to order pasta area and that is gone. The pizza is now really dry. The person handling the roast chicken, duck, and noodle stand is either hard of hearing or just doesn't understand whatever you try to tell him. I don't think he got any of the orders from our table right! I think next year we will try the buffet at the Hyatt. I don't think this one is worth the $60+ per person any more

We went for a Sunday Brunch over the New Year's day weekend of 2016. There were lots of local favorites including chili crab. The selection of seafood was over the top. There was Wagyu beef leg, pork belly, at least 6 different Foie gras, cheese selection to enjoy, deserts to satisfy any sweet tooth. The buffet was a little expensive (110 SG, but I think it was because it was New Year's weekend), but was worth it for a splurge. There was even a lady making balloon animals for the kids which was an unexpected surprise. Definitely recommend it for a special occasion
4
Surprised that the restaurant was so packed on a weekday lunch! Definitely a good sign of the quality and spread of the food. Must definitely eat the following!Raw seafood - if you do eat raw oysters, you will love the freshness of the oysters! The salmon sashimi is also really fresh, we were all amazed at the speed of the chef having to slice the raw fishes.Dessert - the lava cake is sooooo good.However, I would recommend staying away from the soursop sorbet (mocha ice cream was great!) as it was sickeningly sweet. The dragonfruit tasted salty and sour, not sure if there was too ripe or if I should have cleaned my fork before that

A vibrant area with a wonderful variety of different cuisines all looking appetising. A good place if you haven't got much tim

The Line has a great breakfast buffet with almost every food you could possibly want for breakfast. There's a huge area of fruit; another of pastries; an egg station where they will make them how you want them (even had quail eggs yesterday); a section of Indian food; one of Chinese buns, congee, veggies, rice and other Chinese goodies; a salad station with mixed greens and toppings, cheeses, meats including seared peppered tuna and more traditional offerings like smoked salmon and cold cuts; kimchee and other fermented vegetables; and then more British fare such as baked beans, sausage, ham, waffles and more. Fresh juice and gourmet teas and coffees (including espresso drinks) top all of the offerings. You will not go away from here hungry. And the staff is very nice and helpful. They even have gluten-free bread if you need that kind of toast: just ask.
4
Been a regular guest to the line for years, and the one constant compliment that can be given to them is that they have a wonderful attitude in regards to service. The managers, waiters and bartenders all aim to please and are of the highest caliber. This creates an atmosphere that is just like home!
3
I had lunch here and breakfast. It was a glass, plastic and plaster affair, with very good food, but I find buffets overwhelming. It's very very large.
4
We had been eating Asian food for three weeks and decided to order western this time. We did Buck the trend for New Years Eve as everyone was treating themselves to an enormous buffet . I had a delightful spaghetti vongelle, Aldente and just the right touch of garlic and chile
5
This is an excellent place for buffet. I like the atmosphere here and they have wide variety of food you can choose from. The best thing about is that you can take as much oysters you wish! Because there isn't a person standing there and questioning you how many do you want!! Will be back soon!!

This years buffet was "nothing to write home about". Apart from being very expensive (compared to last year) the food & champagne were very average. We did however during our stay, dine in The Line away from the buffet and ordered al la carte off the menu. The meals were quite tasty. We also dined at The Waterfall ( Italian restaurant) where the food was excellent. Try these hotels for a fabulous buffet, the Fullerton, the Four Seasons, the Mandarin, the Marriott to name a couple. The Fullerton does an excellent High Tea
5
This is not your ordinary buffet. There are multiple food stations that prepare fresh to order food. The prepared food is amazing and so many choices. Seafood lovers are well catered for and the dessert bar will satisfy the most discerning dessert connoisseur. The variety of food stations is multi national. If you choose the inclusive drinks package it is well worth it. We live in Australia and each time we visit Singapore, The Line is a must go to
4
We had an enjoyable & hearty buffet dinner on 12 Dec 2015. It was our 2nd time visiting The Line restaurant. The buffet spread is still as fabulous as before. The spread was truly amazing, ranging from Salads, Japanese Sushis, Sashimis, Roasted Turkey, Laksa, Roti Pratas, Pastries, Premium Ice Creams, Yoghurts, a wide range of teas, coffees and other beverages to so much more. It have so many dishes and the live seafood was really fresh. We loved every dish. And I was pleasantly surprised to see they even offer Yoghurt ice creams, Dilmah's premium teas now. Thanks for making our meal a great and delighted one. Will be back for more next time!!! Your staff (Chinese part time boy) was really professional and polite despite of his young age and 1st time working as a server. Thumbs up, Cheers and keep up the good work Shangri-La Singapore!

We had a Bank of China credit card 1-for-1 voucher (original 62++ per pax) and had lunch for our family of 4 (incl 2 boys - teen and primary sch). Variety of fresh seafood was good. Hubby said the oysters were the freshest he has ever eaten! Scallops weren't that fresh. Sashimi and sushi / maki was good.Cooked food: wide variety but not really high-value items. The cod fish was gone in a jiffy and the black pepper dory fish was so-so. Didn't see many cooked seafood items. Mostly chicken and some beef. Variety ranges from Chinese, western, Italian to Indian. Naan (butter and original) was a tad dry and disappointed there were no mushroom masala or fish tikka. Desserts were excellent, especially with Christmas theme. Ice cream variety is best I've seen (around 5-7 types) and there were freshly made crepes. Oh they have freshly brewed designer coffee too, that was a plus. Service excellent too, as expected at Shangri-La. For $62++, you'd better be eating lots of seafood else it wouldn't be really worth it right? Weekend is $72++. Expensive cos of the Christmas theme what with roasts and special desserts. Personally I wouldn't have come if not for the 1-for-1 vouchers.
5
Great place to go to for get togethers. Extensive buffet spread, items are fresh and delicious. It sometimes features special items which are not always on the standard menu
4
The spread at The Line buffet restaurant is very diverse and impressive! From Japanese Sushi, fresh sashimi to Indian meat and vegetarian dishes, to fresh seafood like oysters, clams and mussels, to Chinese Dim Sum, Taiwanese sausage, noodles and rice dishes, to western meats, salads, to local food like Malay Satay, Laksa, roti prata, etc. You will be hard pressed to choose what you would like to eat! There are also special stations for roast meats, kebabs and you can also request the chefs to cook pasta of your choice! The desserts spread is equally impressive with many cake choices (including Durian cake) to local kuehs and also ice cream! The drinks stall is also very good with local tea and coffee to Latte and special teas. These coffee and tea are inclusive of the buffet prices. You can also pay additional for unlimited wine, beer and soft drinks. Service is reasonably attentive given the number of people at the restaurant on a Saturday weekend lunch. Staff are mainly friendly and obliging to help whenever you have any questions or requests. Quite many people are celebrating special occasions and they even provide a small cake to celebrate or take away if you are simply too full. Reservations in advance is highly encouraged since this restaurant is so popular. Seating are available both indoors and outdoors. Plan 1.5-2hrs for a good experience as there are simply too many choices

I had a wonderful brunch-ing session. Foie gras lovers would swoon over the 10 different presentations of foie gras, such as the foie gras with chocolate chips! The highlight of the day was the 48-hour slow-roasted Wagyu beef leg with mustard crust. Its gigantic presence could have brought tears to the little meaty beasts stationed beside, if not for the fact that they were constantly being carved up and sent away to the eager carnivores. Seriously, you are getting your money worth here with top notch meats such as the Tomahawk steak that can cost hundreds in a fine dining restaurant.The dessert list is endless with The Line never failing to impress with its wide variety of dainty cakes, exquisite tarts, fruit trifle, local snacks, over ten flavours of ice cream and a yogurt machine
5
Food was good. Service staffs were all very friendly but was restaurant was a bit crowded due to upcoming festive season.
5
Food is excellent. The staff service is so so. Variety of Asian and European dishes is great. Kids loved it too.
5
I enjoyed the buffet breakfast here. Biggest downside was that my tummy wasn't big enough! Great variety of very fresh food. Beautiful pastries, fruits, dim sum, eggs, breads - the list goes on.
4
The food was tasty and fresh, very large varieties of international food, seafood and a dessert station. The service was very efficient and friendly.
The restaurant is on site of Shangri-La Singapore Hotel and a popular destination to Singaporeans.
5
We had our team dinner at The line and this is our favorite place because of excellent selection of food and high standard of service. Our guest from the head office in Europe promised to bring his husband next time when they are in Singapore because The Line was the best fresh seafood place she's ever been to in Singapore. We will be back next year for sure! The oyster and sashimi are divine!
5
Good spread of many dishes. I like the cold dishes - sashimi, oysters, prawn ....Can go for few rounds just these.After that I will have the Satay!After which, it is the roast meat, chicken, duck.Then I go back to cold dishes.....repeat after this.When I have enough, I go for the ice-cream, and cakes.......Come here with friend, bro, sis, wife. All will be happy
4
First time at The Line and I am impressed by the excellent variety , from the sashimi, fresh seafoods (prawns are oh- so-fresh!) , beef, satays, Chinese dishes and more! The Indian food was extremely tasty that I made so many happy rounds for the curry and Prata :D Desserts were good too and I would suggest u go for the durian cake.Overall - good place for gathering friends and for the excellent quality of food and variety
5
Personally The Line does not disappoint me whenever I come. The spread of dishes are simply fantabulous. It's a huge array and assortment of food, whether the salad, main course, cheese platte or seafood. They also serve Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, Japanese and Western. The seafood section is also good! Although pricey at $95 per pax, with no free flow of drink (except iced or warm water), it's really worth trying The Line experience at least once

I have been organizing Christmas dinners and parties for the last 4-5 years for big groups but had not once chose a hotel as I have always preferred restaurants with more ambiance. This year, I have decided perhaps I should reduce the hassle and opt for a buffet style with beverages included, and I wanted to make a great dinner with good food and guaranteed level of service, I chose The Line at Shangri la for pax of 12 on the 7th Dec. To ensure that we can have an enjoyable night, I went down to the hotel to pre pay for the dinner; I was told to sign on an authorization to debit my credit card form which I did. After which, I was shocked to find out the restaurant has double charged me with a total of $3220 instead of $1610. I called them up and after a long while they reverted it was their mistake and I spent a few days ensuring the 2nd charge was voided. It was still acceptable to me at this point as I understand it could be a genuine mistake and the staff who called me was polite and sincere in resolving the issue. The real disappointment came on the day of the dinner. We were all hyped up and excited in having a good time. As we have paid for the buffet with free flow of drinks, we have requested still and sparkling water to be served for the table. I have asked patiently for the 1st 5 times and my guests have also separately requested and the last few times the server simply did not even reply me and just shot and a look and walked off. I had to approach another server and kind of lost my patience and finally we got the water. Throughout the dinner, the restaurant seems under staff and we are not able to ask for any refills without having to wait. It was really quite disappointing for such a reputable restaurant and kind of embarrassing for me who was hosting the dinner. The last straw came when the server asked me for the bill. When I reached the place at the start of the night, I have mentioned that I have prepaid the dinner. When I told the server I have already paid, he went back to the service manager who then insists that I have only made a deposit and I have not been charged and I will need to pay, which means I am asked to pay for the 3rd time. I explained patiently to the service manager who insisted that payment is not done and showed me his email and that he has received no instructions. I agreed it might be that he did not receive any email to notify him but what was unacceptable was his attitude. Each of his single reply was nonchalant, insincere and zero effort to resolve the issue. He actually gave very snide remarks with a smirk expression throughout the incident. He tried with minimum effort to pacify me by saying he can put up for dining vouchers or refunds or a bottle of champagne but all accompanied with arrogance. I have no interest for any vouchers or refunds as I cannot imagine another round of hassle. I would think Shangri La will stricter recruitment and training for all the staff especially when it is a service industry and we have paid $134 per pax for the dinner

We didn't intend to eat in every night, but the buffet food at The Line was that good; although a little expensive. But its a must because it offers a spectacular array of international foods including fresh seafood and an assortment of delicious desserts. It was filled with people every time and most of them didn't seem like hotel guests...explains why it's been called Singapore's favourite food destination
4
The Line has a reputation of being the best buffet in Singapore. It certainly tries to impress with the variety and also the quality. Overall you cant go wrong with the LINE if you like buffets. Great for families and large groups as well.
4
Indulgent buffet spread. Loved the fresh seafood! Pate and roasts were good too. The staff were quite attentive despite the large crowd.
5
Such an amazing choice and variety. There is something here for everyone. Great egg station, amazing choice of fruit and the coffees are lush!
If you are a cake lover you may as well forget about the diet - the cakes are to die for!!!
3
spread is wide and the space it considered quite big. External of the restaurant is surrounded by plants and you may catch a glimpse of the pool as well. Nice View!
4
Though they had limited varieties of veggies dishes , still you can enjoy the food. I love the Mediterranean dips with fresh pita bread.. and many choices in dessert such as sago with coconut milk.. and some interesting ice creams such as green tea ice cream 
3
I have always been a fan of the line but unfortunately this recent trip made me think there are better buffets out there.I think the standard of the food has dropped dramatically over the years. Hope they look into improving their standard of the food especially like the oyster, chilli crab and etc.Regardless, good service at a lovely restaurant.
5
If you enjoy buffet style dining, this is the place to come. We ate both dinner and breakfast here and there was an amazing range of high quality food from around the world, giving us the opportunity to try all sorts of things. You can eat as much as you want so come hungry!Highly recommended

The Good:1. Their A-la-carte is Open till 1 am, which is one reason we like coming here given how few proper dining places in Singapore are open beyond 10pm! Their buffet is open till 10.30 pm.2. Good menu, with Asian, Western and Indian cuisine options, as well as some decent Vegetarian options.3. The quality of food is pretty good overall for most dishes we have ordered. It's also good value for money as their serving size is pretty big.4. Love the simple but chic decor in Orange and White.5. Staff is attentive, courteous and willing to make tweaks to the food as per your preference, something not every restaurant is so keen on doing.The Not-so-good:1. I find the music here is always a bit too loud, especially at the late hours we have always gone at, though the selection of numbers is nice. 2. I ordered their Malaysian chicken curry, and though the serving size was huge, the dish was not well prepared. The chicken was somewhat tough, and the curry didn't taste creamy and balanced with spices and lemongrass, but was overpowered by the taste of turmeric. I've had better tasting chicken curry in most food courts and kopitiams than I had here. 3. This has happened a couple of times- we ordered soup and we had to wait pretty long for it to arrive (more than 10-15 minutes) even though there were hardly any customers around, and funnily, the soup always came with the main course! I think the staff should be made more aware of the fact that most people would like to enjoy their soup in leisure before the main course !
4
The restaurant is decorated in the Color of orange, and the staff are firendly and prompt to clear out plates. The oysters are fresh and juicy. Laksa and beef is a must try. I personally love the dark chocolate lava cake which is the result of bending 9 different dark chocolates. It is superb and a great miss not trying.
5
My wife and I were looking for somewhere nice to take some friends for dinner this week while traveling through Singapore. I had heard that the Shangri-La had a Thursday night marine centric ( there words not mine ) buffet with an option for free flow alcohol ( which incorporates Proscecco, beer, red and white wine and soft drinks ). For this it will cost you S$ 98 ++. Just over Â£50 each. Yes, I was surprised by the price, but it was the Shangri-La. Believe me we were NOT disappointed. We had a first class evening and the seafood was excellent. Lobster, oysters, mussels, prawn etc etc etc. were plentiful as was the other stations. Curry, meat, sushi, sati, noodles, were also excellent, as was the cheese board. As far as the free flow alcohol it was likewise plentiful with Michele looking after our table with frequent visits to see our glasses were topped up. This could well be one of the best kept secrets in Singapore with this kind of thing only normally available at weekends for significantly more. Give this place a go 
4
2nd visit and the spread is still as great! will visit again! customer service at its best always! :-)
5
Buffé with e.g.seafood (oysters, lobsters, etc.), sushi/sashimi and local food etc. Drinks included. Really good!
5
This is the breakfast buffet area at the Shangri-La hotel. The food is awesome, every selection that you can imagine is there. The service is fantastic and by far one of the best breakfast buffets in Singapore.
5
Although it was very busy, the staff were all wonderful, friendly and helpful. A complimentary salad while we waited for our local-style food. Perfect.
4
We ate here on several occasions whilst staying in the Shangri-la Hotel. There is a vast array of choices and we particularly enjoyed there seafood night .The international selection of food is amazing , you definitely won't go home hungry and the ingredients are of a very high quality.Perhaps the only reservation or negative here is that it is very popular , so can get a bit hectic and noisy at peak times .We loved the food , which was great value and of a very high standard . We definitely would visit here again during our next stay in Singore 
5
Once you reach the foyer of the Shangrila-La head across it in the direction of approx. 11 o'clock and down the escalator. You will be greeted and your reservation checked and shown to a table. There are deals where you pay a fixed price and it's all you can eat and drink from 6:30pm to 10:30pm or you can opt for alacarte. The food choices are incredible Italian, Chinese, European, Indian, seafood (the lobster is nice)...the list goes on. The drink selection is red or white wine or beer or soft drinks. All inclusive of a set price. If you are a smoker you can dine in the garden.The drinks service is a little slow but if you befriend a waiter (ess) with a financial incentive you'll receive a a better/faster servic
4
This is a must for anyone staying at the Shangri la the seafood extravaganza is really that! If you like lobster, crab and the many other seafoods then you have to try it. The atmosphere is chaotic and fun. The staff are attentive and anticipate just about everything. The only caution is the cost of wine and sprits, but they bring tap water which most of those we saw were drinking. The whole buffet is a bazar of food - come hungry is the best advice! I would eat early and ask for things like bread to be cooked to order or it gets a bit cold toward the end of the evening! Try the Lobster Bisque and chilli crab yum
5
This is no ordinary buffet. There are several different stations offering anything from salads through meat, vegetables, Asian style and prawns or lobsters to sweet desserts and cheeses. We dined twice. The first was a la carte where we had excellent pasta ( spaghetti bolognese and pumpkin gnocchi) but the second was on Halloween where the whole restaurant had been decorated appropriately, the selections had themed names and all the staff had dressed up and painted their faces. An entertaining addition to an enjoyable evening
4
Had breakfast and lunch in this restaurant. Amazing spread even at 6am in the morning. Love the Teh Tarik option for my morning pick me up drink instead of the normal coffee/tea. Has option to cater for any culture, chinese congee & dim sum to japanese nato beans to pancakes & waffles. Makes you want to wake up earlier for a leisurely breakfast instead of rushing through to get to your meeting. Great spread of cold seafood for lunch. Love the cheese sprea
4
We were celebrating the husband birthday with my 2 daughters, aged 8 and 3. They had so much fun. There is a candy cotton machine, the dessert section was great. The seafood was fresh! We totally love the food there!My daughters enjoyed their meal very much
5
As usual their dishes are delicious and seafood are fresh. The reception are friendly amd fast in confirming the reservation when mentioned CHOPE. Will use CHOPE for my reservation again.
5
Huge variety and they even serve teh tarik. Excellent buffet and great value for money. Must book in advance. They even serve cheese and food gras.
5
The food was really good, and furthermore there was a wide variety of foods to choose from, I will come back again
4
great choice of food and worth going for drinks supplement but expensive for a self service buffet
Seating was a little bit like a Canteen and one area has TV screens and rolling sports news so not very relaxing
4
Was there with friends on a Wednesday night, which was focused on roast. There are different varieties of food. Local, international and asian. For noodles, you have the laksa, prawn noodles and cold soba. The coconut milk in the laksa was overwhelming. Other local food were roast pork, chicken rice and char siew. There is quite a spread of indian food as well. The satay was great with the peanutty sauce. Then there is the usual fried rice and noodles too. The roast cuts was just too huge so didn't get any. The Japanese spread was very fresh and well made. The oysters are fresh but the mussels and lala are not so. There are quite a lot of alaskan crab to savour. Desserts was plenty but the macaroons was just too sweet. There isn't much room left for fruits and ice cream even though i ate very small servings of half the stuff available. Will go back again for their crustacean night to try
5
5 star atmosphere + an endless buffet variety.Dessert options are just as varied and you will struggle to save space for it!Several great options for seating, so take your time to choose! I would recommend the tables overlooking the pool at the far end of the restaurant. Much more brighter than those nearer the buffe
4
was there for 2nd time and only recently had the time to write something. the food is good, as we went during lunch, (dinner was way too pricey), family of 4 and kids enjoy the chocolate fondue fountain and the wide selection. oyster and prawns were a nice touch and that funny looking crabs (sometimes). else the hot food selection was a plus.I especially love the coffee station as they served "personalized" coffee and you can learn something out of it., else the noodle section, they can really up the selection or chocies for us guests. look forward to it in near future
4
Great buffet! fabulous variety of food! Bit pricey but you pay for what you get! They have a drinks package that can be included with your meal. We opted out of this as we decided to buy drinks as it wasn't worth it for us. It is quite noisy so don't go there if you want a romantic dinner! You can eat either inside or out by the pool

Having been to The Line countless times over the years, this is the first time I actually am compelled to write a negative review. Has a casual buffet dinner with some friends staying over for Staycation. The buffet offerings were the usual. We were very familiar with the stations and have to say the cold seafood station was slow to replenish, to a point that there was less than 9 pieces of prawns, yes i counted as I took 5 away. But the worst service came from the kebab station- The service staff manning the station seemed like he had the absolute worst day of his life and despite my enthusiastic attempt to ask him for servings, he just pulled a terrible long face, even a loud Thank You attempt did not help. He wasn't wearing his name tag, and after serving me, he stomped off into the kitchen, banged around and sulked. TERRIBLE. Now we were seated to a table not at the main restaurant itself, we were at the overflow area near the lifts. We didn't mind, BUT once again let down by service staff who didn't bother much about our company of 7. we had to ask for water and cutlery, which came only 15 minutes later, and cutlery was dumped at the center of the table. Because we were having good company with friends, all of us chose to keep mum about the terrible service. We left reminding each other never to come back
2
Can't fault the food. It's plentiful and with lots of choice to suit everyone. But it is first and foremost way way too expensive for what it offers, mostly at dinner (but I think the breakfast buffet pricing is also high also). Most annoyingly is that you pay half price for under 12 children but full price for 12 -18 with an all inclusive menu of alcohol, at dinner. Alcohol is very expensive in Singapore that's just the way it is. But if you are paying for something you can't have it puts the menu up exponentially. So if you have kids not old enough to drink but over 11 then you are paying for an expensive inclusive alcohol which they can't have. They really need to have dinner price option for those who can't or don't drink. You could always have different coloured glasses or something given when seat for those drinking or not drinking, so they can easily be identified by staff. Secondly, it does just seem really expensive for a buffet, regardless. And finally considering the seating style, it is just really expensive for a cheap and frankly pretty nasty seating style for dinner. (Not so important or bad for lunch and fine for buffet breakfast). But when having dinner and paying the price you are paying, a nicer seating experience really should be offered. It's very cramped and plastic.If you remotely care what I think, go over to the hotels other restaurant The Waterfall for dining. They have revamped menu since we were there last year and the prices are better but also the dining experienced has relaxed slightly making it a more casual but smart casual experience that now also has better kids options. For a family of 4 (with kids 12-18) you will pay less than The Line for dinner and be served by great staff in comfortable and relaxed environment
5
Excellent breakfasts with huge choice of food, both Asian and Western. We also had a lunch and dinner from their al carte menu and enjoyed them as well. Their evening buffet was well patronised however we did not try it.
5
Had the pleasure of having breakfast there. The choice of teas, pastries, fruit, you name it, was amazing. Thought it might have had a bigger toaster (particularly for us Brits) who like our toast !!. If you get a chance go for it.
5
The food served is unbelievable. So fresh, varied, and tasty. Best breakfast choice I have EVER had.
5
Adults and children will enjoy all on offer at this amazing buffet. We had one dinner and three breakfasts here and each one was lovely. Huge assortment of food and cuisines. Worth a visit...
5
Can't recommend The Line for breakfast and lunch highly enough!! Staff are extremely friendly and attentive and the food is amazing!!
4
Had breakfast there, the pastry selection is nom, esp. the brioches. The coffee is foul-tasting, whatever you order.
3
The Line seems to be catering to mass market throughquality ingredients or concept-ideas. As I live a 2-minute drive away from the Shang, I have had lunches at Shangri-La 3 times in 2015. The usual Japanese Counter which is crowded.( untidy and not systematic during dinner hours, lunch time is ok.)The pizza that looks dried.The salad that draws attraction ; people just stand there and gawk at the range.There is a Chinese Soup of the Day, it is in individual bowls and in the steamer, without any labelling. The Indian and Malay food attract alot of attention, I must say, these dishes taste authentic. And of course the ice cream , many flavours, i think maybe 8. Now, this buffet place has a different vibe from the usual Shangri-La establishments :a) Some diners come in rotten Tshirts and flip flops  ( dragging their feet to the buffet tables ... )b) And some Diners are office workers who dress formally and behave decently.c) And some Diners who take pains to dress up because it is Shangri-La ! Some Country Clubs and hotels have a dress code on their websites, they ask for the very minimal" Smart Casual " . This condition is respectable and decent, it is not too demanding of the guest.Obviously the Shang no longer has any expectations
4
The selection of food is plenty, from fresh oysters and cold crab to selection of cheeses and salads to Indian and local delights. Not forgetting their choices of cakes and desserts. The staff are friendly and ready to serve and replenish the food whenever supply is low
1
The range of food offered is not of quality nor was it worth $75 per pax. Was expecting a live station for pasta but there wasn't. Tried the chocolate lava cake but you can taste the chocolate is of very bad quality. Definitely not worth the $75.
3
Attended with friends for a birthday brunch.Food, Chef and kitchen staff amazing. The waiting staff are awful. The waiting staff are rude, slow, not helpful and unapologetic in upsetting their customers.We waited 30 mins to be served drinks whilst the restaurant was two thirds empty and we were surrounded by 10 wait staff doing nothing.As a result we had to serve our selves our own drinks. Will not be coming back any time soon. The wait staff let down the great work that the kitchen delivers.
5
Not only great variety of cuisines from around the world but also amazing variety and quality in the different type of dishes offered per cuisine - and dishes you would not expect in a hotel! very fine dining and exciting stuff!
4
Line offers good international selection with a extensive seafood bar which attracts the biggest crowd. The food quality for the cooked food section is average but trumps other buffet spread by the choices it offers and general design of the restaurant.
5
Buffet-style dining. An incredible spread of Asian and Western cuisine. Something for everyone... at every meal.
4
top class buffet, Huge selection of foods from French oysters to American snow crabs for starters, Superb sushi and super Laksa. Great selection of Indian and Chinese plus western. Trendy style but established (prob 10yrs open in current format) attentive staff. Overall 5 star buffet.
4
The spread is good. Loved the Indian selections and the desserts. The satay chef was having a bad day and was not keen in topping up the satays. Other than that it was a good experience.
5
This is one buffet that needs to be experienced. Its huge, amazing choices. the fresh seafood, the local delights and the dessert bar are the stuff of buffet dreams.

For those wanting an extensive array of cuisines, both Western and Asian, The Line is a great choice. Value for money is excellent if you take advantage of the range of deals on offer on different nights of the week. Understandably, these factors make The Line a very popular choice. Unfortunately, the down side to this is that it can get very noisy. Happy chatter reverberates off the walls and can sometimes make quiet conversation difficult
5
This has to have been one of the most enjoyable meals I have had. The range of food on offer was endless, the quality superb and it was a real adventure walking along the many buffets, trying dishes that I had never heard of. I decided not to eat anything familiar and was rewarded with great tasting experiences. The service was excellent; used dishes whisked away immediately, genuinely friendly and helpful staff added to the enjoyment of the evening. Desserts were impossible to resist

I recently hosted some former colleagues to dinner here as many of us have fond memories of the extremely good buffet here. While the spread is extensive, we have noticed that the selection is not as great as before in terms of dishes (previously there were many varieties of mouth-watering salads including various Thai style salads) nor quality.I used to really look forward to the local Singapore food section - they had satay babi with pineapple dip, and murtabak. Even the Indian food did not include dhal although a vegetable curry was available. Perhaps these are no longer popular dishes.Anyway, it's a good place to meet and the service staff is prompt to refill glasses with water and clear used plates.The most unpleasant part about dining here is the reservation process. I understand there is a need to get our credit card details to secure the booking in the case of no-show. However, when asked what the penalty amount is, I got a garbled response which sounded like the entire bill which is quite incredible. I would think twice about going through this reservation experience.Finally, on the plus side I am pleased that diners can enjoy free parking in most cases - exact number of car park passes depends on bill size

Good choice with strength in sea food with fresh oysters and sashimi corner- tuna, salmon, octopus for lunch. Dinner has one more type of white fish and lobster to augment seafood section. Meat and beef section less impressive. Strong dessert selection. Heavy traffic and rather plasticky chairs. Quality is good but not cheap. Not a bad choice
5
Excellent...Excellent... Excellent...!! One of the best buffets i have ever had.. excellent variety.
4
Excellent selection, fresh food and good service. Went there for a birthday celebration and received a yummy birthday treat as well.

Im a buffet lover. Went to many different buffet in Singapore in recent 4 years. Why only try this recently? No doubt, because it is expensive! We went Tuesday dinner, our bill is SGD 98 ++ for a person. August is a special month, there have fresh durian corner in outdoor seating. More than 50 durian there, unfortunately I am too full.What you can have there? Seafood corner - must try boston lobster, small lobster, fresh oyster (but only have one choice), scallopJapanese corner - must try salmon sashimi, mentai sushiIndian corner - must try satays, prata / roti canai Chinese corner - not recommend anything, sucksOther food corner - oyster with green sauce (not sure what is that, but nice!)Drinks - house pour sparkling wines, red and white wines, draft beer, soft drinks and chilled juicesThey still have ice cream corner, dessert corner, vietnam food, and etc etc etc! Try everything until you full!

The Line is a brightly lit orange and chrome obstacle course of bare tables and open-mesh chairs, offering a mish-mash of Eastern and Western foods all presented willy-nilly in great heaps, free of any cultural context, and largely free of charm. Some of the dishes are delicious: prime Australian beef rib or whole roasted wagyu leg (on weekend), some of the best tandoori lamb chops I have tasted (wait for the fresh arrivals), and industrial heaps of lobster and oysters almost unreachable behind gannet-like crowds. There is a poorly supervised smoking area to one side: non-smokers beware - you will find little consideration from the fumes! The hotel pool makes for a noisy backdrop at lunch. A surprise, then, that the staff are uniformly cheerful and affable - and helpful when they can be. Mediocre value, unless you glut on lobster
3
The food used to be good. However , the standard drops now. Not many variation , especially for seafood and sashimi, and you normally need to queue to get good sashimi. It is not really worth the price for such limited variety now . There are more other hotel buffet to choose
5
Had lunch buffet with my friend.. we were 10 mins early but the service crew were flexible and let us in :) they helped us change our seats due to the sunlight shining on our faces and blinding us so my fried and I really appreciated their patience and help.The food was amazing! didnt manage to try all the food.. the seafood spread was amazing! oysters were fresh, prawns huge and succulent, steamed fish tender! Some dishes didnt turn out too well like the indian skewers but seriously, everything else is amazing! Love the macarons and desserts! Can't wait to go back there again! Yummy
4
A large buffet style restaurant offering self-service breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food choices are excellent and there are numerous cooking stations preparing food freshly throughout the meal time.
4
What I like about The Line is the wide range of variety. It is good enough for me to return back to this place despite it being somewhat inaccessible by public transport. However, since it's such a popular place, it can resemble a marketplace with huge crowds and high level of noises. If this doesn't bother you, then don't hesitate further
5
Humongous buffet offering all one can dream of! Cuisine from all over the world, fresh, baked, stewed or grilled to order, you can't go wrong there. Biggest challenge was to spare room for desserts!Insiders tip : can be a bit noisy at lunch, turn right immediately after the escalator for a more quiet area
3
Our experience travelling as a family was not great. If rules change then guests need to be well informed on check in...Our experience was not nice and we were made to feel terrible...very disappointed as this is an expensive hotel to stay in,
4
Huge variety of menus with live dishes. Very well managed by staff as finding seats during morning breakfast sometime become challenge.
5
The seafood variety is good, the freeflow wine is fantastic, on top of the great Shangri-la hospitality.
5
Had breakfast here with another couple. We enjoyed the variety of food here. Servers are polite. Will come back here again definitely!
4
The line has got some nice cooked food. The lamb stew at the indian food section was lovely.
Oysters were always good when we were there, nice salad and cheese selection, chinese cooked food was nice too
4
Breakfast was excellent . The only problem : the line (waiting when on business trip and the waiter said in a while your table will be ready). In a while means nothing, when you are in rush..
5
Fabulous. Breakfast is outstanding, never ran out, always fresh and always yummy........ something for everyone. fresh fruits. fresh juices and lovely lovey staff
5
Wow, this is not just breakfast, this is the best breakfast we have ever seen buffet style! WOW, so much choice, so many different cuisines, so very fresh, just beautiful! You couldn't eat here for too many days, because you would just grow!
5
My boyfriend and I returned here while we were recently on holiday. I had first stumbled across this buffet when a friend and I stayed here on my 21st birthday and I had been saying to him for years I wanted to go back. I tell you what, it did not disappoint, after all of those years of anticipation it delivered. We went on the seafood buffet night (which is on Tuesday & Thursday night). I was so full, we had amazing dishes that were so decadently put together and the most simple and fresh produced served as is - needless to say I had many plates of fresh shucked oysters, lobster, crab, sashimi, salads, dim sum, freshly prepared sushi, curries, roast, asian dishes, pho, etc etc and don't even get me started on desert.I hope I don't have to wait so long again until I can return
5
Shangri-La Hotel is quite a walk away from the main Orchard Road belt which is probably the only negative point. The spread was good which include the typical fresh seafood, sashimi, sushi, meat, indian and chinese cruisines as well as desserts, ice cream and fruits. There is also a barista there to serve coffee/tea which is refreshing. Even gotten a small complementary birthday cake as part of my birthday celebration. Highly recommended to make a reservation online to get a 15% discount. Would definitely consider this place again for future meals
5
The most amazing buffet I've been to. There is something for everyone and everything is delicious. I think there were about 16 food stations all catering to different cuisines from laksa to Indian curries, Chinese, sushi, continental, salad, seafood, Malaysian, British roasts, fruit, desserts and ice cream - even candy floss!It is a bit pricey but well worth orand the kids ate free, which was a really good perk as a hotel resident.
5
Peaceful place, clean environment, staff are friendly and great choice of food, i like the place here
5
Had dinner with my APAC team here tonight. Every imaginable food item you could ever want. Was a walk across several countries. Amazing quality food and service. Well worth a visit for a special dinner.
5
The food selection was incredible and the quality of the meat and the presentations were top notch. Every taste is catered too from beef, pork, chicken....it was all terrific. The Indian food was quite good as was the fresh sushi however, (and probably due to my personal preference) the seafood bar was over the top. The oysters were cold and very fresh, the lobster and lobster claws were great. The clams, scallops, very fresh prawns were just perfect. Nothing was left out and it was all quite good. The service was outstanding. The only slight tick off were the some of the parents that seemed to think that their kids running through the restaurant was an okay beviour but it was only one small issue and certainly not reflective of the Shangri-La staff. It is pricey starting @ SGD 118/pax...158 pax with free flow wine, beer and champagne.We will be back again....just need to lose the weight from this trip first
4
Go for the seafood sashimi with oysters, crab, shrimps and just take all you want. Pretty decent buffet with Japanese, Indian, Salads, Seafood stations and my favourite turns out to be beef satay. Various cheeses available at the salad station and wine is available if you would like to pay for it, not included in the buffet charge.The most amazing was the candy floss well hidden in the dessert corner. Staff friendly and overall ambience is actually not too noisy for a buffet restaurant. As we leave, there was a long queue trying to get in which tells you one thing for sure, you need to book prior
5
Everything you could imagine at this superb Hotel Restaurant, however it does come with a price. We had our breakfast included with our accommodation which was perfect. However we did order a few take-away meals from The Line on a couple of occasions which made for a convenient meal. From memory the Dinner buffet was $76 for adults and $38 for children. Take-away meals were reasonable from about $20
5
We went for Sunday brunch buffet with free flow of champagne. It is the largest "line" of food I have ever seen, they even had candy floss. Beside the obvious choice of amazing seafood I also had a chance to try lots of local specialities like chilli crab and local sweets whack I probably wouldn't have ordered as full portions. It is amazing experience but for me - of a "tried it", I won't do it again. I felt tempted to try too much and felt completely over fed for the rest of Sunday. Anyway. It was worth it ;

lunch buffet at ‘The Line' is, huge buffet spread. Fresh seafood, Italian, Arabic, Chinese, local cuisine, Indian, desserts and so much more… Attentive restaurant staff. It was crowded because of huge seating arrangement. Everything we had, tastes just amazing. This is one of the best buffets we had. Only thing we did not like that much is…their Indian section. Very first thing I saw in Indian section is, ‘Pani Puri’ (one of the most famous Indian appetizer). I would say, that was the worst pani puri..we ever had. Rest of the dishes on Indian section were just average. So many varieties of desserts. Many flavors of Gelatos and sorbets, chocolate molten cake, frozen yogurt, cakes, mousse etc. etc…We also, had Breakfast buffet at ‘The line’, it was huge. So many things to choose, from local delicacies to western cuisines and Indian as well. Variety of breads, Cheese, Jams, cereals, yogurts, juices and fresh coffee, Egg station (you can customize your omelette), Fresh hot pancakes and waffles. Everything tastes super good. Highly recommend breakfast buffet at ‘The Line’Thumbs up!!! for not just quantity but, for quality and taste as well
5
The waiting staff were a notch above the rest given the crowdedness of the restaurant during dinner on two consecutive Fridays that we were there. Food was fresh and prepared by a really international ensemble: truly international buffet. Everyone's favorite was the oysters, and the staff had to really shuck them fast. And they did. I simply love the range of cheese there. The spread of dessert was awesome, and so too the tea selection. I believe you can get best rotiprata or other native cuisine elsewhere in the neighborhood, but the hygiene standard and comfort there is something of a guarantee, given the reputation. On my second visit, we even got complimentary durian ice-cream, nitrogen-frozen
4
Ok this review is way overdue. We celebrated my man's birthday at The Line last year. I always made it a point to inform the staff whenever we are celebrating any occasion. They surprised him with a cake and a birthday card signed by the staff working in the restaurant. My man was smiling non stop. He thought I'd paid extra for this personal touch but I didn't! Thank u for the extra effort for my man. Food wise.. Well fabulous but the oysters gave me the runs. Perhaps it could be bcos I overate the night.
5
I have dined at The Line a number of times, mainly for lunch and have always been impressed by the variety and quality of the food.The Line is the place to go if you are looking for a banquet style lunch. The price is a little on the high side, but for this you get seafood and as many other cuisines as you could think of
4
Went for the seafood buffet. Good selection which included crab, shrimp, oysters And mussels and various other seafood items. They had a Japanese and Indian food sections that were both very good. Only complaint was it was very pricey.
5
11 different food nationalities to choose from. If you can not find something to eat then you are to fussy.
5
We had the buffet breakfast as part of our hotel deal. Loved the food, massive choice and wonderful service. There is something here to suit everyone young and old and of any nationality.
5
Always come back here for brunch when n Sibgapore. The choice of food especially fresh seafood is amazing. Leave feeling more than full but an absolute must
4
For a buffet, food and service was amazing. Quite expensive though if you aren't a drinker and don't eat fish. i.e. the $100pp free flow night. It was something else though, glad we did it.
2
So now I know why they named the restaurant The Line. It's after the huge queue outside the door waiting for breakfast. Problem is efficiency as there were tables available but not cleared in time - also with one person showing you to table it takes far too long - 25 minutes in fact! Also the evening before after being told by reception "no need to book just turn up" which we did only to be told no reservation no tables, we are full! Credit we did get a table eventually albeit outside with the mossies....just to add that when we asked for the air con to be fixed as it was blowing warm no one came until we asked repeatedly...6 hours later. So having stayed here many times over the years service standards have dropped significantl
5
Many things I love about this buffet. The range of fruit juices. Desserts include a fantastic selection of local desserts like sago gula melaka - in sampling portions - so you can try them all. The oysters are very very fresh. The Yorkshire pudding is outstanding and goes so well with the wide variety of roasts. And for visitors - the opportunity also to sample chicken rice, peking duck and Indian fare.
4
The oysters were never ending and the roasted ribs just melted in my mouth! Sashimi was good too, didnt have room for much else. Was quite disappointed with the dessert selection. Waiting staff were not very friendly, serving and reception was excellent!
3
Not as elegant as other hotels. We had to queue first day. First impression I encountered appeared like a shopping mall cafe. The ambiance was also lacking, colour scheme was in bright orange! Food was plentiful with variety. Fruit juices were not squeezed freshly. Champagne was a nice touch for brekky. Bit of a queue where the omelettes were fried, you could see the lady was getting stressed out. More staff needed there.We had lunch once, which was quieter, less people and the food was A la Carte, delicious
4
The Line is to me one of the best non-Halal international buffets in Singapore. My friends and I were there one Saturday afternoon to celebrate a birthday and it was truly memorable. The restaurant was so full that even though we booked two weeks in advance we were first assigned to a table at the takeout Deli outside of the restaurant. But upon our request, we were later transferred to another table inside when there was one available. The Japanese food section and seafood on ice were amazing! You know the food tastes and looks fresh, as they put only small portions out and replenish them frequently. Their roasts were tender and they offer a wide spread of international food including Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine. Their cakes and pastries and other desserts gave a sweet ending to our afternoon meal. It was a truly wonderful experience for us
4
Breakfast spread was eye-popping and you will be spoilt for choice. One of the nicest breakfast spread i have seen in Singapoore.
4
The variety is just wow... Couldn't try them all with just 1 stomach. There are different sections for different cuisines of the world with my favorite being the grill and carving secitons.
5
Great food with something for everyone. I'm a fussy eater but I always left contented. The breakfast is really good as is the Dinner Buffet.
5
Great atmosphere. spacious dining area. dine with comfort and luxury settings. good array of variety of food. friendly and helpful staff. we came with baby. and we had fantastic time
3
We had dinner buffet on a weekday. Buffet variety was impressive, quality not always top notch: Seafood and sushi/sashimi are well assorted but the western fare as well as the Chinese dishes (Dim Sum, soup) are not very sophisticated; quality of desserts leaves to be desired) e. g. Bavaroise/verrines with far too much gelatine); satay not properly marinated, poor choice of salad greens and so on.The place is extremely noisy (inconvenience added by the noise of the exhausts), piped-in music is horrible; group parties are placed in the centre (instead at the edges to minimize their vocal contribution).Public is of the mixed kind: Nouveau riche Chinese, American expats (with noisy children) and tourists from Russia.For some S$80/person I expect better and not a canteen like setup
5
Very extensive buffet dinner restaurant. Have indoor and outdoor seating. On Tuesday and Thursday they have the fish buffet added which a wide range of fruit de mer. Food ranages from Japanese to Western and Indian to Indonesian. If not full from that you can compose your own grand dessert, fruit bowl or cheese platter. Soft drinks, beer & wine are included in the price
5
Visited on a busy Sunday evening for dinner. Huge variety offered, and the fresh shucked oysters were in abundance, unlike other cheaper buffet venues where you had to fight with other diners over them. We were spoiled with too many choices that we did not get to try out everything. They even had cakes, chocolates, macarons, sweets and candy floss for desserts. As it was Mother's Day, we were surprised with a stalk of rose for each female diner. Customer service was excellent with friendly and smiling staff
4
We enjoyed the buffet at the Line on a Friday evening. The place was busy but did not feel over crowded. There is an amazing selection of food from all around the world and enough variety to suit every taste. The selection of fresh shellfish was amazing as was the desserts including ice cream from a machine (my favourite). You need to book and if you do online you get a 15% discount. There was a free flow wine option at 35 dollars (i think this is cheaper on tuesdays and thursdays). Highly recommended
2
Waited at the counter for almost 5mins where counter was left unmanned. Could understand if during breakfast period the restaurant is busy, the management should have at least 3 hostesses at the counter to rotate rather than having it left unmanned. Waitresses seem to be very busy clearing and setting up tables yet lack the personnel touch of even remembering or having some eye contact with the customer. Clean bowls were not refilled at the cereals and pastries counter while the kitchen staff who were manning the counter were busy chatting about their personal matter and couldn't be bother to replenish crockery at their counter. My fiancÃ© stood up and asked Amy one of the waitress for a clean bowl, yet few mins later she walked passed him and brought the bowl to someone else who sat somewhere else while he was still standing waiting for her. That's how much an impression of the breakfast fiasco. Food was plain and layout of food was somewhat disorganized to me ie some square commercial white bread served at the cereal and pastries counter while hand made bread is somewhere close to the juices and smoked/cold cut section. Coffee wasn't freshly brew and serve as and when customers order as it tasted sourish. All in all Prego at Fairmont whether in terms of food/drinks wise or staff wise done far much better than Shangrila
5
Casual almost to casual for a fivestr hotel expect the service staff to dress up better ahould'nt wear crocs while on duty it looks really ugly should be what we expected a prober service shoes we want ed to win the respect from the staff. We will dress up probalbly in anywhere in public there if the staff dress up like that kind you fill welcome and win that kind of guest too
5
I enjoyed eating in this restaurant. The variety was amazing as well the freshness of the primal materials. Really nice experience eating in the outdoor terrace. I recommend sushi
4
You can eat all you wish at this buffet restaurant - and the choice of food amazing, from Oysters to Crispy Duck.You can if you wish eat A La Carte. The food was excellent
5
Very good food, friendly an cooperative staff.
Food quality is very good and they have variety of things in there menu and very nice experience.
5
Wide variety of food to choose from and set in a nice ambiance overlooking greenery and pool.
Lots to love - fresh fruit juices, wide choices of pastries, live stations.
Children friendly!
4
Excellent brekky for all the family. Wonderful range of dishes from local fair to all the international options. Great service
4
Had my breakfast and lunch there during my stay. The spread was international with varied choices. They try to change the line up of food daily. Service was good despite the heavy influx of guests. Once they put me in a table which was in the way of the servers. My wife brought it to the attention of the Service Manager and we were transferred to another table. The next day, they made sure only one person used that table with the outside chair not being made available any longer
3
We've had meals at The Line many times. It easily accommodates a large group, with varying tastes. The local food is well represented but falls short of being competitive with the best. One of the better buffets in Singapore, with many chef stations, preparing dishes fresh.
2
I have been visiting The Line restaurant for many years, and the service and food quality have been consistently good. However, the service I received today was strangely subpar, and it appears that the food quality is no longer as consistent as before. Between the two of us, we ordered the Chef’s salad, half dozen satays, seafood hor fun, and Cod&cabbage. The food took more than 40 minutes to arrive (after asking the waitress multiple times), and when they did arrive, it was ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Absolutely ridiculous. One would expect them to serve the salad first, followed by the satay, and then the main courses. Instead, we had to wait for a really long time with only water to stave off our hunger, only to have everything arrive all at once. If this were an average chain restaurant, like Swensens or something, I wouldn’t have minded, but this is The Line we’re talking about here and one would expect no less from it (i.e. I should not have to specify that I want my food to be served in a logical order). In addition, the waitstaff still needs more training, as it felt like many of them were on the first day of their jobs!Moving on to the quality of food. The chef’s salad, a favourite of mine, is great as always (The yuzu truffle dressing is absolutely amazing!). The satays were also quite good, with the meat tender and juicy. However, the seafood hor fun was a let down. The flat noodles were grey and too burnt, and the the seafood in the hor fun was definitely the frozen kind (the squid also tasted rather “off”). The cod&cabbage was even more disappointing, and a huge waste of money at $40. The hunk of cod fish was not tender at all, and the dish lacked any acidity to cut through the overly fishy and oily taste. The deep fried slices of eggplant only added to the greasiness of the entire dish. In addition, the cabbage part of “cod&cabbage” appeared to be missing, with the cod resting atop the mound of barley rice.Overall, this has been a disappointing experience, given that the food and service were pretty good during my previous visits. I doubt I’ll be back again, and perhaps only for the buffet (the buffet is still very good, and the main draw for The Line).Pros: Items like Chef’s salad and satays are quite good, and their buffet is no doubt one of the best in SingaporeCons: The main dishes fell flat, do not order any a la carte seafood items!!! Service is too variable and inconsisten

The Line Buffet at Shangri La Hotel has always been one of the best buffet restaurants in Singapore. Even though the buffet isn’t exactly affordable, I know there are many folks who swear that The Line is one of the best buffets around. The crowd at The Line was crazy when I went last week. Crazy is probably an understatement when the 400 seated buffet restaurants is almost filled with people on a weekday lunch. Just for your information, most of them are not even hotel guests with the majority being buffet-loving Singaporeans. I must say The Line Buffet is an international buffet which has a very wide selection for their buffet lines. From the popular Japanese food, to Chinese dim sum, local favorite dishes, standard western dishes, exotic Indian cuisine, and has a pretty impressive array of desserts lined up for sweet-tooth people. Besides Western pastries and cakes, they also have some local kuehs available. Not to mention that there’s also the seducing chocolate fondue, and a truckload of ice cream to get you into a sugar-high., there are also chefs preparing local favorite dishes like Chinese noodles and roti prata ala minute. Given that most of the food in a buffet is prepared beforehand, it’s always refreshing to see the chef preparing some of the items on the spot, there’s definitely plenty of options for everyone. Not economical but certainly worth the visit

Feb15 marks my 3rd visit to The Line. Unlike my previous 2 visits which was during dinner time, it was champagne brunch this time round. Was pleasantly surprised at the wide spread of food for brunch which included seafood, sushi, salads, Asian delights (dim sum, satay), pasta, roast and not forgetting cakes, ice cream, fruits and chocolate fountain! I always head to the tea and coffee station for a nice teh tarik after my meal. Oh, almost forgot to mention that the champagne was excellent and the wait staff were prompt in topping up our glasses.Definitely worth the value paid!
4
We stayed at the Shangri-La hotel and used this restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast was comprehensive and good quality food. Open until 10.30.
4
The Line is the Shangri-la hotels buffet restaurant. We went for lunch on a saturday and although the food quality was good, it felt too crowded around the buffet which spoilt the atmosphere a little. Also found many meat courses but few cooked fish items
5
This is the best breakfast in the world. It's a shame I felt so poorly during my trip to Singapore so didn't get to enjoy it, but it was really amazing and the choice was just fantastic!
5
Breakfast was amazing but then later in the week we had the lunch and evening buffet which I must say has to rate as one of the best we have had in any hotel, not cheep but worth it.
5
Excellent theatre kitchens providing superb food from all parts of the world. If you are on a diet, you will need a lot of willpower.
5
I love the immense variety served at breakfast - Chinese, Indian, Western cuisines, superb selections of fruits and juices. Great service too!
5
Came here on Sunday for brunch (the most expensive of the timings). Despite the cost though, I must say that The Line definitely lives up to expectations, with its wide spread range of food and decadent desserts. The amount of food there is so much that you'd probably not be able to try every single item even if you took a small bite out of each. They have a cheese station, Japanese section, one for seafood, a pasta section (where there is also an option to build your own pasta), oriental selections, kebabs, yogurt, Indian, ice cream, fruits etc. I could go on and on. Definitely take your time here to make your money's worth. Not cheap but certainly worth coming for a special occasion
5
If you want to experience the best, then The Line is the place to go.... nothing else compares.I recently returned with family to celebrate a birthday over the lunch buffet. The range is extensive. The fresh seafood, the Asian dishes, Western, Italian, Arabic, Indian, desserts, etc.... It was over whelming.The staff kept the table clear and waters topped up. They brought a birthday cake to the table with candle and they could see we were too full to enjoy it so packed it up for us to take it home to enjoy afterwards. Nice!When I say the food selection range was extensive, this was the only buffet that I know that had a candy floss machine! The buffet also included a nice selection of freshly made coffees and teas.The setting was great. Although every table was in use, they have designed the buffet to be spread out, to avoid too much congestion in one space. Was it busy...yes, but not so much so that we felt cramped, or didn't get to try everything we wanted and it is popular because it is the best.It was my third time, so I knew what to expect, but other family members were blown away by it and repeatedly stated that this is the best buffet ever!!!!Finally the price. When you consider the top quality and extensive range of food, the fantastic service and the great setting.... the value was excellent.100% recommend The Line and I will return here again.... after I have worked off the buffet lunch :-

This was THE PLACE for high tea buffet 10-15 years ago. These days, with all the newer, hotter places popping up all over the islands, we don't really think of coming here anymore when we visit family and friends in Singapore. I'm glad that we gave it try this time. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite, from the foie gras and smoked duck salad, Chinese roast duck and chicken rice, sashimi, raw bar, lamb curry and prata, satay to desserts and fruit. They also have a coffee/tea station that served very good tea. The coffee/tea/hot chocolate beverages were included in the buffet, which is nice (yes, some other places charged separately for coffee/drinks).Granted that it does not have the greatest selection or the more delicate desserts one would see at Edge nor does it have the more elaborate local fares one can get at Straits Kitchen, the quality of everything I tried was solid and the service was good when we were there. Happy with our visit
4
The restaurant is situated within the Shangri-La hotel. Although a little pricey the restaurant offer a buffet service with several geopgraphical menus. The crayfish bar is exceptional and can have a cue. All of the other areas I tried (Chnese, Indian etc.) had beuatiful food. I personally recommend the Malaysian Beef Rendang which was memorable. Full marks 
5
wide range of food, lots of different nationalities to choose from. Its a bit like a cafe but its definitely worth trying
5
You can find really anything you want from sushi to shrimps, from pizza to kebab, from nasigoreng to mezze, from oysters to beef
5
I really,really love the Line. So much excellent food from all over Asia and beyond. Everything perfectly cooked or prepared. Excellent value free flow wine. All this and the chance to sit by the Shangri La green spaces. Superb
4
the atmosphere is very nice.... they offer many option of food .... quite pricy but it is worth the money u pay..........
5
No doubt one of the best buffet in Singapore. Enormous spread and good quality. Seafood are fresh and dessert are well made. Everything works well for a great dining experience! If you are looking for a place for gathering or a celebration, give The Line a try
5
This restaraunt is a part of Shangri-La "big family" and it says everything.The food from different parts of the world including seafood. I prefer seafood especially when it's fresh. Very nice and attentive staff. Atmosphere is very pleasant.A good choice for a lunch with colleagues or for romantic dinner
5
Enormous selection ranging from western , continental and Asian can make you enjoy breakfast and yet not repeat on the courses. Staff are attentive, and offer newly baked items such as ham and cheese croissant and several cocktails. Come early as it tends to become chaotic with the large volume of guests
2
Though it is clean and great variation of foods available, the people there are very casual and the quality of foods is mediocre. I had a nice breakfast around 6-7 years ago but something has been changed?? Also, the staff working there is not professional as I was forced to wait for them to pass by..

The hotel is beautifully decorated and has lots of choices on where you can dine within the hotel.One of our friends was moving back home so we organised a leaving lunch here. We had a party of 8. Which they were able to accommodate. The lunch is from 11.30 to 2pm. The price is $48 ++ for a buffet lunch with unlimited tea. They have a large selection of tea. The buffet is hot and cold food. From local cuisine, to sandwhiches, cheese and of course plenty of desserts. There is also a choice of free flow wine for $25++. There is only one choice of white and one choice white. The whitening that has been chosen for there house wine is very good.I highly recommend

Been to The Line quite a few times since I arrived in Singapore. It has quite a good spread and I have to say that the marine spread on Tuesday and Thursday are better if seafood is your thing. Personally I like the ambiance of the place, with good day light for "window" seats. The quality of the food is amazing. Nothing much to complain about
4
Big selection of international food.
Yummy and delicious!!
Even my mother-in-law liked it so much.
The table sitting was not so good because we have to sit at the Garden Terrace with only fan facility.
4
Really buzy restaurant with a buffet that should be priced at half the S$88 it is. Yes, the buffet is one of the better I have experienced and it is "all-you-can-eat", but it´s a buffet!
5
My partner an I had never been to Singapore, One thing I was always told is there Buffets wether it lunch, Brunch or Dinner are amazing! So I search strenuously for the best hotel buffet it was hard but for some reason The Line kept drawing me in and I do not regret my decision.We went for dinner they had so many stations and the most amazingly fresh sashimi And wasabi I am yet to find Wasabi as refined as at The Line (sounds silly I know).I know its not the cheapest but its great value about as much as you would spend at Perths Crown Casino Buffet and it has possibly more.Also the atmosphere of the hotel leaves you wishing you booked a room its a stunning hotel The Shangri-La also I have to congratulate the hotel on the gentlemen who welcomes the guests out the front I cant believe I forgot his name but we talked with him for a good while before our taxi came he was the most fascinating man (he is a mature man with dark skin he was wearing a traditional style costume with a head piece).Trust me go to The Line A++

Had a birthday celebration here for my friend and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Seafood was really fresh. Loved the prawns & oyster which were sweet and the tangy asian chilli condiment complimented it so well! My friends overloaded on the sashimi. I liked the dim sum counter and the Indian section was really yummy as well! The naan was fresh & hot, curry was really flavourful.There were 2 beef dishes for the night. The one with brown sauce was fantastic! The other one was let down though as it was overcooked. Spoilt for choices at the dessert section but I really loved the A la minute Nutella Crepe. Paired it with vanilla ice cream! Ms. Erika was attending to our table and she is very courteous, friendly, and efficient! She provided a very non-intrusive service and which really made our dinner more enjoyable. Please pass along our thanks to her :) Will definitely return! Thank you

Always enjoy breakfast at the line when staying in the hotel.Great selection of all types of food for breakfast, service is sometimes a bit slow but it's mostly self service anyway.The coffee is not much more than coloured water, could really do with something better but that's my only criticism as I like strong coffe
1
My family went to The Line on a Sunday evening. I was left queuing for seafood each time as the staff was just too slow in replenishing the oysters. I have been to many buffets around Singapore but this has to be the slowest! This is not something I would expect for the price I paid per person
1
Terrible choice of dishes and price did not match the quality. Food here was priced similarly to the main hotel restaurants but did not reflect the quality elsewhere in the hotel
3
Located in the Shangri La hotel. Seating is quick but then you have to catch someone for your drinks, orders...I had even orders which simply were not served ...but not on my bill either...the food is ok very similar to the room service menu and directed to a general international cuisine. It can be very noisy.
5
In terms of variety of food, I think The Line is the best buffet in Singapore, I especially like their italian selection and the desserts (yummy cream brulee). The price is not cheap but I feel it's worth it for that special occasion, been here a couple of times and always came out happy with a full stomach. The only negative might be the location, you can walk around 15 minutes, but most likely you'll need to take a cab since there is no bus stop near the hotel

Had dinner buffet for 2 at this restaurant, was expecting top notch service even better than my all time favorite (Triple Three at Mandarin Orchard or even Greenhouse) and great food but it turned out to be average buffet. We arrived at the restaurant sharp for our reservation, but had to queue to get in. They were very short handed and only one person was mending the reception. Understand that its a big occasion and restaurant is pretty crowded.We were assigned to a corner table(thank god), and they asked us to get food first while they prepare the table for us. After trying out some of the food, I would only recommend the sashimi, seafood(didnt try the prawns), roast duck and the prawn noodles. The Salmon and Tako sashimi was super fresh but they refill it very slowly. Roast duck was superb!!! Way past expectations.Things to stay away from: DIMSUM (It was horrible) and nasi briyani.Dessert section appeared promising, I wouldn't say it was not good, just not spectacular. There was huge selection of fruits, cake and other kinds of popular desserts such as kueh, crepes, FROYO(so rare), icecream(coconut flavor MUST TRY), fondue and chocolate pralines. Given the amount we paid, S$277 for 2 pax, I was expecting better quality food. Quantity is important but quality should be prioritized. Wouldn't come back again for dinner, might try the high tea next time
4
The food quality and selection was awesome, the price (88$) was a bit high. Atmosphere was a bit stressed, but the bottom line is the food was great and contains a lot of different cuisines.
5
Great spread for all meals. Very warm and welcoming staff. Would recommend the desserts and the sea food. The local cuisine was also interesting.
5
Indian Vegetarian food was available. Apart from that, pizza, momos, breads were also available. The dessert spread included pastries, cakes, ice-cream. Do try the hazelnut ice-cream one of the best.
3
Inconsistency across the kitchens/food quality was the only criticism. Eating buffet gave us the option to linger longer and we sat outside in the garden.
4
Massive food choice and even when busy the service is very good.
Something for everyone and all very fresh, and can be cooked to your special needs if required.
5
The seafood catches everyone's eye, but do try the Indian food, as well as the Donner Kebab!
Items change daily do it's like eating at a new restaurant each time you dine there.
5
We had a fantastic lunch at this sophisticated lunch cafe at the Shangri-La during a business trip. There was an excellent range of food, quite we'll priced for a hotel, beautifully served and delicious. I would definitely come back to this cafe.
3
This restaurant was a big disappointment, and for a top class hotel to run a cafeteria like this is quite sad. The staff had issues with each other (not good in front of Guests). The waiting staff were not looking to be helpful, in fact they looked the other way. I was handed a knife blade first by one young man when I asked for a clean knife. The food was merely mediocre and the freshly fried noodles were served up cold. When I asked for butter I was told its on the end by the bread, in a manner that said open your eyes and you will see it. There is some training issues that need attending to here, this is one of the more expensive hotels in Singapore and it needs to earn its place as the best , it is not a right based on the name
5
A buffet always offer choices. Selection is a must for buffet spreads. But it really rare to have both QUANTITY and QUALITY. Best of both Worlds? Yes, it happens here. I must say the quality of food impresses me more than the quantity! Lets go through some recommendations: Laksa, sashimi, sliders, salads, oysters, satays, durian cake, yuzu n strawberry ice cream...Opsss did I share that the above are just the BEST that I had picked and 40% to what I have eaten at the buffet. This is the place if you want quality with variety and a lazy afternoon lunch to chit-chat with friends. Natural lighting through the glass already sets the right ambience for your meal. Yes, I am going back.

Celebrated my wife's birthday here last month. Where should I begin? It's really a gastronomic paradise. Probably, the widest array of food you can find under one roof in Singapore. Seafood station, noodle station, chicken rice station, Indian cuisine, South East Asian cuisine, meat carving station, desserts station, chocolate fondue and fresh fruits.The food was spot on! Very nicely presented. I didn't try the seafood selections which seemed to be the most favourite among the diners but the Indian food was really tasty, the satays and rojaks were fresh and tasty too. Do save some space for the desserts! Lots of mousse, praline, cake, tart, crumble, fresh fruits, chocolate fondue and a cheese station.The service was excellent. Staff were friendly and efficient. Plates were cleared promptly. Complimentary car park coupon was presented along with the cheque. Definitely one of the best buffets in tow
4
You are able to have either buffet or from the menu. I ordered from the menu and it was good. The service was adequate and the room was ok.
4
Wide variety of food, nice ambience. Good gathering place with friends.
We went for the dinner buffet which cost alittle high but worth it for the food.
3
Its so crowded on Fri and weekend dinner buffet that you have to queue for everything and it gives one the feel of being at an NTUC supermarket checkout line!
5
There are so many different types of food at the buffet spread. The quality is good. I like the environment, clean and bright.
The only drawback is the price!
4
The Line is one of our favourite dinning place.
They have with a wide selection of food. Noodle, rice, desserts.
International food selection, Western, Japanese, Hong Kong, local, Indian.
4
Value for money, good spread of quality and fresh food to choose, friendly service staff and nice ambience.
If you intend to dine there, advise to make a reservation in advance. Suitable for gathering and family with children
4
The spread of food is vast and by the time you complete a round of all the food, it would have filled most of the tummy.
5
I've eaten at the Line on 4 different occasions, and the restaurant has maintained its high quality over the years. Although it is pricey, you really get what you pay for. There is a very wide spread of cuisines and food items to choose from. And unlike other hotel buffets, the quality at the Line is very good. All the items look and taste good and the oysters, seafood, sushi and sashimi are very fresh.Excellent place to go if you have a large appetite and want to sample a wide variety of food.The only small problem I faced once was trying to get my water glass topped up. I asked several different waiters for water, but I never got my water topped up. The restaurant was full and they were busy, but that is the only glitch in my experience with the Line. I will definitely return when in the mood for a buffet

Hi, I have been to The Line quite a number of times which has always been quite a nice experience both of lunch and dinner. However on the last trip I was so disappointed that I might not go again. It was a department lunch which I organised. The issues1. I made a reservation about a month ahead of time however due to the year celebrations, a lot of slots were not available. I understood the rationale. During the reservation I asked about the discounts and was told the usual promotions which we were entitled to. However about 2 weeks from the actual date, I was informed that about three quarters of the promotions was not valid and were under negotiations with the respective credit card issuing banks. But they assured me that it would be confirmed nearer to the actual date. Unfortunately no reply came and on that actual day, apparently even the front desk receptionist was confused on which card had the promotions. The one she assure me was valid turned out to be wrong. Luckily I had a standard chartered which still had 10%.As this was a company event, the budget had to be cleared and the confusion was not something that I expected of Shangri-la 2. The seating that was provided to my party of 9 was disappointing. Apparently it was just next to the plate collection section and also where they were throwing the unfinished food. So in a way we were seated next to a rubbish dump. Didn't exactly make for a pleasant dining experience. And they were some flies around too. I even had to inform the staff that some pieces of beef had spilled onto the ledge of the collection bin as it was very unsightly. 3. I hadto remind the staff to refill our glasses on quite a number of occasions which was pretty irritating. I'm not too sure about the parking privileges of the guest at The Line but for larger groups it would be good for the hotel to have the initiative to ask how many complimentary parking that we would need. Instead of just offering to the one paying the bill
5
Had our dinner buffet for the 3rd time this year at The Line and still holds on to the top list in my dining catogary! Huge range of cuisine... and favorite of all is the dessert corner.. the best macaroons you can never get anywhere else. Will definitely return again. Worth the experienced! :
3
The price per pax is S$88 and food offered is mediocre.
Seafood is plentiful but the cooking flavor is not one that you want a second helping.
The place is brightly decorated and simple.
5
The buffet meals here are fantastic - countries from all over the world are represented, and the food is always fresh and delicious.
5
Had a really great time at The Line in Shangri-La. Good variety and service; great value for money. Will definitely come back!
4
went for the lunch and dinner. good spread and quality of food. not a place for romantics though but good for a gathering.
5
We had a champagne brunch at The Line in December 2014.Shangri-La Singapore was never a disappointment earlier, this time it was no different either. Perfect service, wonderful environment and absolutely marvellous food. Not cheap but you get what you pay for: highest quality of ingredients, fantastic assortment and lots of attention to details. Very much recommended
1
We , 14 of us had a company lunch on 11 dec at the line restaurant. We had a good lunch but in the evening 6 of us had bad tummy. We reported the case to the assistant manager but we were questioned by them. It was a bad experience and we wont go back and we will.share our experience with our friend
4
We recently visited The Line to enjoy a leisurly Sunday brunch. We opted for the free-flow alcohol and were pleased to find the Champagne was Perrier-JouÃ«t. Although $158++ may seem a lot for a brunch, alcohol is expensive in Singapore and it is quite easy to spend that amount just on a bottle of good wine in a restaurant.If you look at the photos you'll see it's not a 'romantic or cosy' restaurant at all. In fact it seems a bit dated and was noisy. We sat outside and that was much more relaxing. There are fans overhead and it was not too hot when we were there. If you want to be seated inside you need to reserve well in advanceIt took a while to be served a drink- in fact I had to get up and ask a member of staff to bring us some champagne and missing cutlery. However after that the staff were very attentive. There are some grubby- looking metal 'food nets' on the tables outside that certainly need replacing.As for the food, I can agree with other reviewers that the spread was very good. My only complaint is that when I tried the Indian food and satays (under the hot lamps) it was all cold
5
It is one of the best brunches in Singapore ! You find such a big variety of food that anyone would find something that would satisfy them.We have been there many times and we had never been dissapointed. Food quality is very good, you need to diet the whole week so you can get your reward here !....

Been to Fullerton Hotel (Town Restaurant), One Farrer (our review was deleted for no reason) and of course, Shangrila (The Line Restaurant) and The Line Restaurant's spread of food was the best. Due to the size of the restaurant, we shouldn't be expecting the same personal service that Fullerton's Town Restaurant provides. The restaurant was very crowded today (9 Dec) and we couldn't walk around without bumping into another person. There was a queue everywhere, sushi counter, salad bar, cakes section, ice cream area, tea/coffee counter. The spread was so wide that we think we only tasted half of the available food. We love the salad bar, sushi bar, Japanese food, the durian cakes and puffs, the baked ham with Apple sauce, the Chinese maize/carrot clear soup, the various seafood, the crepe and also the Cappuccino. We were so impressed with the Indian staff that could do everything: from Tea Tarik to Kopi Tarik, from Cappacino to Espresso and other tea. Really love the sweets! The selection for the Chocolate Fondue was so generous. You can have ice cream which include Green Tea ice cream and also Youghurt . The only food I found a little too cold and hard for me was the wraps, like popiah and with meat in it (can't remember its name). We have been to the Line many times and we still enjoy the food there. Will be back soon
4
This place needs no introduction. It is one of the more popular 5-star buffets in town. For the price you pay and the branding behind it, I personally would expect something better; but to put it in perspective, it is still better than the other 5-star buffets in town, in terms of spread and quality of food. I also like the ambiance here
4
The Line offers cuisines ranging from Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Malay, Indian...etc. The quality of food is great and it is fresh. I was spoiled with the food choices and I didn't know where to start. I will recommend this place to buffet lovers.
5
This buffet is the best buffet i ever had. The quality of the food is excellant and with a wide selection. Been to the Carousel as well which i can say this buffet is good too but not as good as The Line.
5
Been to The Line during my singapore visit. the quality of the food is excellant with wide selection. This is the best buffet i ever had.
5
the food you get here is very good and you get everything you would need from all corners of the world just go and enjoy.
5
The best buffet in S'pore. The service is wonderful. Great selection of Seafood (Crab, Oysterts, etc) and Satay. I wish there were more meats like Steak. The deserts are amazing - coconut ice cream and chocolate fountain.
5
I dined at this restaurant for breakfast and dinner during my stay at the hotel. The choices for the buffet were amazing. Several cuisines are catered to, the standard was amazing, the quality was excellent and the service was excellent. Really enjoyed our meals there during our stay.The restaurant is very popular and it pays to book a table for the evening meal
5
One of the most amazing buffets I ever had. Not being an over-enthusiastic seafood lover, most buffets in Singapore somewhat made me feel i was missing half the fun, but not here. There seafood was excellent even to a landlubber like me, oysters were absolutely fresh (no raw fish aftertaste) and sushi spread was delightful. However, the array of cuisines and the way they were organized blew our minds. Desserts were excellent and they had softies.Service was excellent, will love to go again. They also gave us a big anniversary cake (one that can be shared by four people, not just a slice) and since we were already full they let us take-away the cake, such a nice gesture. Spent our 10th anniversary there and was worth the occasion. Loved it
4
going to Shangri-La buffets, you can always expect good food & service, so we have experienced this before in Shanghai (by far the best), Kuala Lumpur, Cebu, Manila, Hong Kong & Ningbo.The Line is Singapore is a great buffet in terms of variety, style and service. The Seafood part is good with fresh oysters, gambas, crabs & mussels... the Indian corner as well gives a good variety of all choices.. including tandoor oven choices (but cold and not fresh..).. Western corner is ok with a good variety but lacking on something nice or special... just standards. nice dessert corner and loved the bread&butter pudding ;-) the staff is well trained and very friendly and going the extra mile to satisfy the needs of our little boy .. I was wondering when getting handed the drinks menu, that the booklet was falling apart... guys, that's a 5* hotel.. that should not happen... I am distributing hand made menu's from Europe to you, if you are interested - people would be more impressed with that..overall... very good experience, but I am still a little bit more in favour of the Carousel as it is more unique and decadent ... ;-) pricewise, they are both the same somehow.
3
My wife & I had been to this place several times a few years ago and really liked it, and thought that this was one of the very best buffets in Singapore, which says a lot, as Singapore has quite a few good offerings of this type. When we returned this time, we found that the place has deteriorated some, in pretty much every way. The place looked a bit run down (it is still reasonably beautiful in an absolute sense, but it is no longer stunning; it could certainly benefit from a renovation). The food was good, but not as great. The same was true of the desserts. In short, a good experience, but there are better ones to be found in Singapore
5
Modern surroundings,wide selection of food plus excellent service makes the buffet breakfast in the Line one of the best breakfast buffet I have eaten.It is impossible to try out all the food at the various food sections in one visit. You need to revisit a second time to sample all the food available,,,,,Western,Chinese,Indian and Malaysian..For those who enjoy having sparkling wine during breakfast,there is free flow of Prosecco at the fruit juices corner.This "full" buffet breakfast is value for money
4
I do not particularly like the atmosphere but I do like the opportunity to try different types of food.
5
Lovely food in a beatiful ambience. You can choose from a varied buffet. And dont forget to keep your tummy empty for the desserts - they are really very yummy!!!!
3
Chic bu a bit industrial decor. outdoor seating facing the garden is more enjoyable. Service was very nice though.
5
Compared to any buffet in Singapore this is by far the best in value and the variety. Their seafood, Japanese section, Steaks and Dessert are my favorite! They do decent Indian and Malaysian section too. They've salads, Italian, Chinese and a live Chinese/Noodles counter too. There is no way a person can try everything in one meal that they have to offer and all this for $58++ Best part -- go to their online booking area and they often have discount deals of 15-25% on weekdays!
4
The Line is a great restaurant concept - with island style kitchens to feed every palette. When I was there with my wife it was very busy and some of the dishes were empty so it looked like food was missing (that's why I gave a 4*). Though the quality was very good as was the value for money .. Service was good and quick... 5* definitely if the replenishment was faster ...We will be back .. Thank you
4
The buffet was huge with cuisine for all tastes, ranging from Indian, seafood, Italian, Japanese, Asian, European. The setting was nice and pleasant, and excellent service all round with the tables cleared constantly and glasses of water always full. The desert range was very good and since we needed a sampler of every type, perhaps some smaller bite sized portions so we didn't waste as much!Rated as one of the best buffets we have ever had, so a must visit if you are in Singapore
5
The Line has one of the best buffet in Singapore. Wide variety of food has authentic tastes. Advanced booking is recommended as it was fully booked when trying to make a reservation one day before. If you are hungry for a lot of food with variety and great service, this is the place to go in Singapore
4
The Line International Buffet @ The Shangri-La Singapore Hotel is a Value For Money Worth Your Every Cent you pay for ! Its buffet menu has lots of variety and is a great place to bring your family , friends or even your business associates . The food quality and ambience makes it a really very suitable place to just catch up with your friends and family members or even for a discussion with your business associates and colleagues 
5
Singapore is a country obsessed with buffets and to be a notch above the rest ain't easy but The Line has achieved just that. Food served has a good variety, authentic tastes (international buffet - so expect different cuisines) and fresh ingredients. It is a popular restaurant so advanced booking recommended. Diners tip : make reservations online through their shangri-la hotel website. There are online dining discounts available including a senior citizen's discount which is 35% off for the entire table (so if you have someone who's over 60 in your group, the rest of the table gets the discount too)
4
I had long heard about the claims of The Line being the best buffet in Singapore but I had been holding back because of the price. Finally decided to pay $80 for a weekday dinner with free flow drinks. I was not disappointed! Drinks include wines, soft drinks, fruit juices and a stall with famous teh tarik, coffees and teas. Spread was good but like all buffets, some are good while some are not. Seafood section was my favorite and fresh. Sashimi section was a little disappointing as most of the choices ain't as fresh.Worth going for
3
Wide selection for buffet, nice ambience. Food is of average quality. Fresh oysters, salmon sashimi. Pastries and cakes are disappointing.
4
The buffet here is incredible! It's expensive, but the choice is second to none! It gets very busy and there seemed to be locals dining in it too, which is a good sign.
4
There was a very large selection, but the buffet featured everything you would expect to see...nothing really out of the ordinary.
4
Lots of variety. There's japanese, western, chinese and indian cuisine. We love the sashimi counter especially the scallop sashimi. Its plump and sweet. Perfect start to your meal.The oysters and cold prawns are great too. Good service and lovely ambience.
2
We went to Line today on the recommendation of friends. Stepped inside and hearts dropped instantly. The atmosphere was somewhat akin to a grubby canteen. It reminded me of a trip to Guilin in 1990. Noisy, and grubby with chipped laminate tables, paper placemats and packet hand towels a la local coffee shop. Food was very good by comparison. Many thanks to the kitchen staff who obviously take pride in their craft. All stations were well tended and prep was painstaking. We especially enjoyed the availiabilityof good (if limited) sashimi, seafood with juicy local style lobster (not a hint of atlantic lobster here) and excellent satay, indian and chinese food. The Chinese menu was limited yet of good quality although we would have liked more vegetable options.Our biggest disappointment was that my father (at 89) was eager to treat us all to a grand experience. If I'd been able to arrange this food in a more subtle location everything would have been perfect. As it is, paying over $130 per head for an oddly lit orange and blue piece of kitsch with echoing walls and uninspiring decor left me wanting in the extreme. It seems to me that the Shagri La needs to get its act together. Overly reliant on a reputation established about twenty years ago, they need to step up. The only other alternative is to rename Line as the staff canteen and start again
4
I enjoyed myself at the line buffet lunch, loved the drinks station where u could get nice teh tarik and hazelnut lattes, many different kind of teas, dessert station and cold seafood station was great too. The roasts are also nice. The rest of the cooked food were not really memorable since I usually dont eat those for buffet
1
No point mincing my words, terrible service, terrible food, terrible atmosphere. This from a five star hotel I think not!!!!
5
Amazing variety for a Sunday brunch. Choose great food from more than 15 different cuisines that are prepared in front of you. The seafood station with oysters and lobster is a great start, but sure you have room for more. The salad bar and the Indian food are my favorites. The kids love the chocolate fountain.Make sure you reserve early via their website and get a 15% discount! Go for the drinks inclusive version as this seems to offer the best value. Make sure you have nothing else important that day and enjoy the line
4
Food is good, with a nice variety of different cuisine. Plentiful of desserts and atmosphere was nice (plenty of foliage outside) although it was crowded during lunch hour. Could do more for service as there were mynahs eating from used cups outside the restaurant for quite a long time till a staff covered the cups up. Felt a little unhygienic but else was ok.Enjoyed the food very much.
2
This was certainly one of the top addresses a few years back and from a recent experience it is clear that years have not been kind to this restaurant - if you can get through the reservation desk and get yourself understood, you're facing a totally chaotic brunch with terrible service (forget about getting a refill in less than 20 minutes) and very poorly tasting food - Overall astonishingly noisy, lacking in originality and just very down market.Having a hard time deciding between "Poor" and "Terrible" but one easy decision is to avoid this place altogether
5
I love The Line and their choices of dishes from Asian to Continental to Western and even for the health conscious
5
For breakfast, lunch and dinner the choice is vast, yet everything is cooked to perfection. Some really unsual and authentic food that I havent seen elsewhere
4
The dinner buffet at the Line has has one of the biggest variety of Cuisines in a buffet in Singapore. Especially on the seafood night and when the alcohol buffet can be added on top you can't really ask for more.For the alcohol buffet they used to offer proseccos, white and red wine and Archipelago beer free flow for $25++The place gets very busy yet one would still expect the staff to be friendly and cooperative especially with this being part of the ShangriLa and its elite status maintained, however you would find not-so-friendly staff at times
3
We enjoy a good champagne brunch every now and then, and as a family each person gets to choose on a rotational basis. This time it was The Line at Shangri-La. It took four telephone conversations to get the booking confirmed. That should have been enough of a warning. When people don't answer the phone, or call back when you leave your name and number.... Things that make you go hmmmm.The selection of food was extensive but ordinary, and there were no "gems" such as fois gras (you need to go to the Ritz Carlton for that). There was the usual prawns and oysters, but not much was exciting although it was all fresh. But the service? Only 2/3 of the restaurant was occupied, but it took forever to get our first drink. Clearing the table was slow, and getting refills of champagne (or indeed coffee) took ages. I dislike it when I'm paying top dollar at a Champagne Brunch to need to ask for a top up because six staff members have walked by making sure they don't actually look at the guests or the tables.Not in a hurry to go back any time soon
5
We went for breakfast and will be returning to try the lunch or diner one day soon. The choices were extensive and the food delicious. The only slight downside was that one end of the buffet created a bit of a bottle neck with the line for the egg station, so it was hard to get to that end of things. The juice bar offered bubbly and fresh juices but they struggled to keep up with the supply of clean glasses. This may have been a bad day and out of the norm, but we did have to wait a couple of times for a few minutes to get glasses for the juice and bubbly. We sat out by the pool and it was lovely but I would request an inside table in future as the birds were everywhere
4
Visited last August. We went in during a busy mornings shopping. The place was modern, bright, airy and clean. The buffet looked fab. We were seated in the packed out restaurant quickly. It was like Piccadilly station (very busy) people were walking around and frequently bumping your chair/table. Decisions decisions - such an excellent selection. We went for European and Indian! The food was good. Place was a bit to chaotic for my liking but it's that kind of place
5
Was recommended by friends and tried to give a try. Honestly, you just made me your number 1 fan! There is a whole lot buffets! I personally go for freshness in the ingredients and varieties.The Line have a nice decoration and great service to let them shine through the crowd which makes the whole experience a pleasure
4
It was Tuesday night dinner at The Line, which also meant it was "Oysters Night" - usual occurences on Tuesday evenings (Thursday evenings are "Seafood Night"). I heard of The Line for a while, and finally got to savour its goodness with *Celine tonight.There was quite a large spread of food of all kinds of variety and cuisine - everything was very organised by relevant sections. Almost all the savoury dishes were cooked with seafood, i.e. abalone pie tee, char kuey teow with scallops, and lobster laksa etc. The desserts station was extensive and definitely looked tantalizing as well. Best of all, there was an outside station serving durians, mangosteens etc!I tried quite a few items, including the must-have platter of Seafood - raw Oysters, Crab, Scallop and Mussels. The Oysters were large and juicy - tasting especially good with sloshes of Tabasco sauce and lemon squeezes.The desserts were all delicious as well, such as panna cotta, cakes, crispy pancake with ice-cream - some of them were infused with alcohol.Overall, dining at The Line was a lovely experience. I also loved the free flow of wine, Champagne and fruit juices. Service could be improved upon though. I would like to come back to try the Seafood Night (Thursday evenings).For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/08/dinner-at-line-restaurant-shangri-la.htm

I had two meals here (dinner and breakfast), both of which I did not pay for. The spread is huge and there is a variety of cuisine (Chinese, Indian, Japanese, European, etc). However, I think that the quality of the food is just average. In my opinion, I think there are better buffets in Singapore, e.g. “Melt ~ The World Cafe” at the Mandarin Oriental has better quality food, although they probably have less variety. The other thing I would say about dining here is that its chaos. The restaurant is packed with tables and there are tons of people crisscrossing all over the place, so it’s not going to be a relaxing dining experience. Not all buffets are crazy like this one, in fact, this is probably one of the few I’ve been to that’s like this. I found the restaurant design a bit strange also, maybe it’s supposed to be some sort of modern, chic, artistic style but it felt very plastic to me. Breakfast here was similar but less crazy. The dinner buffet was SGD82++, I certainly would not pay that kind of money to have average food and the kind of experience I had at the restaurant. Service at the restaurant was good though (at both dinner and breakfast)

I had dinner at the Line with some friends. What you can definitively say it the buffet is high class, various, very good, and you really have choice for every taste (chinese, japanese, indian, dim sum, european, sushi, nice deserts area…). Unfortunately you can't eat everything (or even try) so you'll have to come back ! I am seafood lover and I have to say that the oyster/crab/prawns/clams/sashimi/sushi choice made my day ! Wonderful ! I would advice to put more choice of fresh fruits for desserts, especially because there is a chocolate fountain which is great with fruits (there is a large range of candy proposed but I don't like it, personally).The only think that would make me hesitating to come back is the atmosphere: it is noisy, there are families with kids, there is a lot of people of course, and it is not romantic or quiet at all. A shame
3
There are plenty of choices of food to eat here, including lots of seafood and different varieties of Singapore cuisine. It is however, quite expensive for a buffet style meal.
1
a big disappointment. we knew the shang buffet as one of the better ones in singapore. not any more. selection of food is below average, services as well.
5
With wonderful tasting fresh oysters and different kinds of crab and then a very wide variety of different ethnic foods including delicious turkey (turkey in June??) and fabulous deserts, this is worth the price.
3
We ended up in this restaurant hoping to order simple 'a la carte' meals. Their selling point is definitely their buffet, so we were left on the wayside. Our meals took forever...
5
The food was excellent... the variety was really beyond our expectations, japanese, indian, chinese, fusion, teh tarik,,.the lust is endless.. service was great.. keep up the great job.
5
If you like buffet meals then this is the place for you. The choice is positively mouth-watering and the staff are efficient and helpful. We also sampled the a-la-carte menu which was just as good.
5
Excellent quality, super variety, from Oysters to fresh juices of all kinds, and Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Indian cuisine!!! All fresh and tasty. And for when you need a break from Asian... You can get pizza as well!! Low side: some times it was too crowded for breakfast.
5
I normally stay at the Shangri La. For this trip clients booked me into another hotel. But every night I traveled to The Line. I come here when ever I am in Singapore. Outstanding choice, great service and- given the standard and variety - real value for money
3
Booked a private buffet dinner to celebrated our 20 years since we ROD from army. Was given a private corner along the main bar as ours is inclusive of free flow of wines and beer. Good range of food and dessert. Bad part is the service is sucks, plates and leftover are not clear leaving it messy. Wines and drinks are not top up till we have to voice out. Manager gave us a face when we were talking and laughing loudly at times but what do you expect from a long time gathering right. The sight of the manager really irks me! Asking for plain water at 1030pm was like begging. I was utterly disappointed being treated this way in such a posh hotel
5
Went there during my birthday for lunch buffet. Lots of varieties ranging from asian to italian. Every station serve very good cuisine of its own. Chinese station serve nice wanton mee, Italian station serve nice pizza, Japanese station serve really fresh salmon sashimi. Dessert station was good too. To top that up, the food are constantly refill which is a plus as some restaurant will delay the refill of popular food. The environment are quiet and suitable for quiet relax afternoon meal. To top the day up, i was surprised with a mini chocolate mousse cake for free from the restaurant for my birthday! That's really something you don't get everywhere. Really appreciate their customer service.
5
Buffet lunch of brunch on weekends is something that you really can enjoy wide variety of excellent plates from Asia as well as occidental specialities. Reserve enough time and eat VERY light bkfast : )
5
Wide variety of food to choose from the buffet. Those who love dessert, there are many small treats. Oyster, crab and lobster are very fresh. Every table seems to have full plate of those at least 1 serving.
4
Ate here when I was staying at the Shangri La hotel for business. I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner here, and food was fantastic! The breakfast is huge, with lots of choices, from an omlette stand, to fruits, fruit juices to sushi, Indian, even bao, and fried rice. The best thing I liked was the coffee stand. You could order anything you wanted at the stand. The service is very nice, and they will even give you little bags to take over any left over bread or pastries. Their pastry/bread bar was amazing too. What a spread! Lunch was good, but usually hurried for me, and I didn't get a chance to experience it as fully as the breakfast. For dinner the buffet was very pricey, and I stuck to a-la-carte, which was also somewhat pricey, but the quantities were huge and the food very good. One evening, the chef even sent a couple of small plates over to add to my meal. Very nice touch
4
Had a family night out at The Line and found the variety of buffets excellent. The presentation was very good also. All the items that I tried were fresh and tasty.We had good service on the night that we were there.My 9 year old daughter absolutely loved the desert buffet, with the chocolate fountain. The choice of frozen yoghurt and ice cream was fantastic.I don't think The Line would be a regular option for our visits to Singapore but it is worth a try if you haven't been!!!!!
2
The food at the line is varied and good.I especially liked the Indian dishes but the noise from vast numbers of screaming babies and toddlers rules out any enjoyment.The very surly serving staff dressed in what looked like budget airlines cabin crew outfits also helped to make this a very poor dining experience.There are much better buffet brunches to be had in Singapore-most notably The Grand Hyatt
4
Having had the restaurant recommended I was really looking forward to the buffet. Unfortunately it was one of those buffets were everything looked better than it tasted. As someone who follows a dairy free diet I was disappointed to find the only dessert available was fruit and a sorbet. Other buffets in the area were able to offer a variety of desserts. I did thankfully follow the advise of another reviewer and did get a 25% discount. I had to find a server to get a drink and no one returned to get us further drinks. Shame as the bar upstairs offered exceptional service.
3
I was there with a friend for a farewell lunch, as I have read so much good reviews about this place.Although the restaurant is at the basement and there is an escalator straight from the main hotel lobby. The restaurant is spacious and bright.The food is fresh, especially the seafood like crab and lobster. At least this place serve real lobsters and not crayfish. The selection of food is rather disappointing, but this is probably because I have read so much reviews.The service staff are friendly but plates were not cleared promptly until been told to even though I was seated next to the waitress station (the restaurant was not full since it was mid-week). There were 2 occasions where I found the crockery was dirty and had to inform the waitress to send it back for cleaning.Overall, I will not go back to this place as there are other places that serve similar quality of food in more conveniently located area. However, if you are particular in freshness of food, then this will be the place to go as the food served is one of the freshest I have ever tasted for buffet
5
Is it Silver service? No!! Will it be the greatest individual serving ? No!!But bang for buck unbeatable!!! The range and selection is unbeatable. If you go on Thursday it is seafood night. Oysters , prawns, Crayfish, Sashimi etc. Free flow wine and beer. For $92++book online and get 15% off. No brainier. Tell we I can go with this range of food, in a five star hotel with free beer and wine , anywhere in the world , please!!! Coupled to this the service was great. Smiles and a desire to please. The best..And consistently good. Been many times
4
I was invited by my friend for dinner for his 21st birthday. Started off with the seafood station. They had lot of fresh oysters, crab claws, mussels, scallops, prawns. But the oysters were seriously the best. Their sushi/sashimi station was decent. Not a lot of variety though. And the sashimi kept on running out, probably because it was popular with other customers as well.Their hot dishes are pretty good. The lamb rack was amazing and their pasta station was pretty tasty as well. They also had an assortment of Singaporean local food like chicken rice, satay and prawn noodles. The desserts were yummy. Lots of variety. My favourite was the creme brulee and the hazelnut cake! Good range of ice cream flavours as well and they served yogurt and crepes too! (Take note, green tea ice cream does not go well with nutella & banana crepes. I learnt it the hard way.) And of course a chocolate fondue although it was a tad bit disappointing as there was not much variety of fruits/biscuits to dip into the chocolate. They also had a hot drinks station where we could order different types of coffee (hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, mocha, latte etc), and different types of tea. All this was included in the price as well.Overall, pretty good food. I would say the cold food (seafood, sushi, sashimi) is slightly better than the hot dishes. The chocolate fondue was a bit disappointing but the rest of the dessert made up for it. I especially loved the oysters, the crab claws and the creme brulee

Do arrive hungry for this sumptuous sunday brunch. We decided to try out The Line after all the comments from our friends. Offering a large spread from Chinese to western to indian and local, the buffet was well designed with different cuisines served in different stations. Every cuisine was done perfectly with authentic taste and fresh ingredients of good quality. The service was prompt despite a crowded resturant. Our overseas friends from UK whom we brought along were very impressed and enjoyed the experience as much as we do as we got to try out all the different types of cuisine in one seating in a comfortable and beautiful restaurant. recommended !!
3
The restaurant serves a good spread but the food was nothing to shout about.
Not especially delicious nor exotic.
However, the staff were very friendly and provided exceptional service.
Upon knowing that it was my birthday they even brought out a complimentary chocolate cake.
5
Many stations of food. Their western and Japanese food are the best. Their food is very fresh. Have to book early, even online booking entitle you to have discount.
4
It was very crowded during weekday lunch time with long queues. On another note, for me, there was quite a variety of food to choose from.
4
Lots of different selections of good quality food. But, be sure to get there early as the good stuff runs out for the day rather quickly.
4
It was our family's first visit to The Line and it didn't disappoint. Although prices are higher than other hotel buffets but quality is good. The seafood selection was very fresh and the freshly shucked oysters were really good. Wish there were snow crab legs but the crab selection was also good. The dessert choices were also plentiful. As it was touted as international buffet, I was wondering why I couldn't find Italian food choices. Although our family was seated at a corner, the staff stationed near us was quite attentive and cleared our dirty plates very quickly so that is a plus. Do remember that this restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating so when you book, don't forget to state your choice of seating. This is a family friendly restaurant so if you are looking for a not so noisy place, this might not be it. Lastly, this restaurant offers complimentary parking for customers, so don't forget to ask for your coupon
4
We booked by phone and got a good table for 4. This is a good option if you have Sat free and want to avoid the high prices for sunday brunches in Singapore. Arrive early at 12.30pm for a quieter start as it was very busy by 1.30pm. Kid friendly with high chairs and good kid food options. The buffet was varied and good quality. Decent seafood section, good duck and sushi. Desserts were especially good including divine macaroons of many flavors! Staff was helpful and friendly. Outdoor seating available by the pool but it was warm out there. Light, airy restaurant. Would go again for sure
5
During our many trips to Singapore, we always work in a stop at The Line's Thursday evening seafood buffet. The food is always fresh, and the servers do a great job clearing the table between shifts, and keeping the beverage glasses full. This time the lobster was unusually plentiful, and the variety of numerous selections eye popping. A bit pricey, but I've learned you get what you pay for, and this restaurant is well worth visiting
4
Singaporeans are crazy about buffets. My husbands attacks the oysters and seafood sections and my mum is crazy about variety. There are queues at the oyster station, where oysters are freshly shucked. There are also queues at the sushi station. Be prepared to go for a few rounds to get your fill. A great variety and freshness guaranteed on the food
4
One of my most favourite restaurant for buffets with family and friends. The buffet includes an array of apetisers,soup, seafood, hot meals, local, Italian, western, Indian and Japanese cuisine.The important thing here food is fresh and well replenished. It's worth the time as well as good value for money. The defining characteristic of this place is the lovely sushi bar, prime roast beef, rack of lamb and suckling pig.. amazing!! Not forgetting, tantalising variety of desserts, cheese selection and fresh fruits. The dessert station, just awesome, crowd's favourite. Each piece of dessert is finely perfected like art. The excellent food, coupled by nice ambience and comfort is just inspiration to be in. One shouldn't be too worried or concerned of service staff in all-you-can-eat buffet style
4
The Line is a favourite haunt of my family (incl my parents and my younger sis & her family). We head for The Line at least once per year because of the huge selection of food choices and dessert options. The seafood is reasonably fresh and we love their Seafood nights where drinks are included in the buffet price: excellent deal!!! We like that there's a pretty good selection of Asian food (made to order noodle selection with BBQ pork and duck as well as braised chicken and crispy roast pork) and the fact that there're several choices of ice cream flavours. Recently there's even a yoghurt soft serve selection which is pretty decent. Love the calamari and passion fruit flavoured yoghurt! If you make your reservations online, you can even get great deals such as 15% regular discount or 30% senior citizen discount. I found the atmosphere lacking, it's a little to clinical for my taste, but it's value for money and will keep your party of various age groups happy enough :
5
This is outstanding and possibly the best buffet in the world.
I would recommend this as a must when one is in Singapore.
5
Went a few years back, I hear it is still open. The choices were amazing and the quality first class. A choclate fountain to dip fresh stawberries in...not on the low end of the cost scale but well worth it...
5
although it was always very crowded ,but there was somthing for every body ,see food , chinease ,arabic rice .indian ..fantastic fruites and sweets corner as well as coffee and tea corner
4
Been here a few times, most recently Dec 13, it is usually packed and reservations are a must. The seafood and sashimi counters are the most crowded followed by the dessert sorbet and drinks counter. The hot drinks selection is great and I enjoy the lovely teas that are available. Definitely needs more than 1 visit since it's hard to try all the food unless you have an enormous gut
2
We celebrated a birthday there recently over a Sunday brunch. The range and variety of food was excellent. However, the value for money was so-so. Attentive service was given by the staff escorting us to the table. However, the experience was ruined when my hubby requested a sliced of steak from the person in charge. He was given scrapes. We spoke to the manager and he said he was not surprised that we complained about the incident. He gave us a fresh slice of beef. I felt that this should not have happened at the line considering the premium that we paid for the food and experience
1
Big buffet, so so quality. The highlights is the carvery (excellent steaks) and desserts (not too sweet, great macarons). Everything else - give it a pass.Service was terrible as well. Waiter had the cheek to tell me "No you have to wait, we are very busy" and then abruptly walk away. Went to Rise at MBS the following day - totally different experienc
5
Journey the world in one restaurant. It's no wonder that The Line has been awarded so many honors. There are 16 different stations inspired by varied nationalities. It's fun to be adventurous and try new things. Great place for families and anyone that is a fussy eater, as there are so many options. Go to the barista counter and get the local coffee. It's impressive to see them with the production pouring...
4
We've been here before and definitely wanted to come back. The Line still serves very good quality food, but unfortunately, Thai cuisine is no longer really represented (they've increased the choice of Chinese food instead) and the Indian food is not very spicy. Huge spread of excellent seafood and fish though! Come early if you want some atmosphere (others may call it hustle and bustle) as most patrons leave twards 9

I recently went here with family and everyone was impressed with the variety and quality of food on offer. On the day we went, there were no oysters, but they had replaced them with lobster --- actually we prefer lobster so this was fine with us.The choice ranged from Western to Indian to Oriental to South East Asian, so it could satisfy pretty much everyone --- except vegetarians as there was very limited salad. But why would you come to a buffet for salad?The lobster was really exceptional, while the Indian food was also great. The mixed roasted meat was really good --- unfortunately they cut the piece just a bit too big and filled us up quickly. However, this is a buffet after all, so I suppose they didn't want us to complain that they weren't giving us enough. Can't have it both ways!Just some advice. Either get there really early and stock up on the cold seafood area, or go to that section last. That part of the buffet is jammed up right at the beginning and you can be queuing for a long time. You might find it easier to start at the other end of the buffet.Also the wait for coffee at the end of the meal is a long time. They have a special stand for coffee/tea etc but it is only staffed by one person so you can end up waiting 20 mins for a drink.Service was quite slow on the tables, they didn't clear the plates that fast and you have to keep pursing them to serve water.Having said that, I wasn't there to drink and we could pile the plates at the other end of the table, so we didn't really mind.Come back? Definitely

Always loved the brunch at The Line - great food and service in a lovely atmosphere..but we went last Sunday and were so disappointed :(The restaurant was packed as usual - Sunday is a great eating out day in Singapore but I was immediately struck with how untidy everywhere looked.Waiters stations piled with used dishes. queues at every station.The food is usually so good but it seemed a bit less cared for - no nice roast meat (just chicken pieces), no lobster, no oysters - it all seemed a bit less elegant.But the service was almost non existent - the waiters walked past finished plates on our table and the neighbouring ones several times, even when we went to get other dishes we would return to dirty plates still in situ. Water glasses remained unfilled, we had to ask for cutlery and the staff seemed to be more interested in avoiding eye contact than providing the usual Shangri La service.Even as we were leaving no one even looked up from the reception desk to reply to our goodbyeThere just did not seem to be the same level of professional service I've received in the past so really hope it was just a one off, it would really be a shame if The Line goes the way of so many places in Singapor
4
Worth n my most favorite Hotel for buffet. My Company held three functions here for staff gathering, real good choice. We will definitely be back!
5
Value for money.Should try.Niece enviroment. The staff are friendly. Food are fresh.Many choices of food are available.
The air conditioner is of right temperature. Food arrive in time and guest don't have to wait for too long.Many variety of food to choose
5
I went there for the international buffet with my colleagues. A lot of variety , fresh and It is worth for the price.
5
A must go when they have promotions. Value for $ in Terms of variety. Great place to hang out with a bunch of friends.
5
I often book The Line for birthday dinners, special occasions and good value party dinners. The food is top class and the packages are good value. The staff are extremely courteous and you always feel special dining at The Line. I absolutely love it! One of my favourite places for taking the family ... but also fun for a girls' dinner. I wouldn't say its particular romantic or the best place for couples, its too hectic
3
i have been a regular customer to the Line fro years for private and as well as corporate functions.surpirsingly ont he last ocassion in NOV 2013, there was abrely any servers for our group of about 35 of us. we ahd to clear our used plates and get our own drinks. beers and wine was also slow in coming. it was a real disapoointment . this experience has put down shangri la image. this was not expected at all
5
On of the best free flow of oysters, sashimi, meat and pasta. So much of food to enjoy that it is will deems sinful to globble them up all in huge portion. Try every dish in small portion instead to attain the full taste of everything. Once you ahve tasted them all, pick the one you love to eat amd no one is there to stop you. Ever. The cakes are one of the best delicacy. Bottomless softdrinks serves to the table is a pride enjoyment. If you are too full to move back home, Spread your generosity to the hotel directly upstair of the restaurant and enjoy the facilities. And the next morning, you are guaranteed to wake up to a buffet breakfast. Unless you overslept that is
2
thought there is a lot of food i would have to say that the quality is pretty average. there was a huge wait for the seafood when we first got there, but this did die down after awhile. they are pretty understaffed so that the drinks are hardly ever filled up unless you really push for it
2
After hearing so much about the spread and food quality at The Line, we finally decided to give it a shot.All I can say it that it was a bit of a disappointment. Ok, granted, the seafood selection was more than decent with the oysters, mussels, and prawns being very good, the rest of the food was just average or below average.A few examples, the roti in the Indian selection was rather chewy. For SGD 72 ++ was rather disappointed that their carvery section consisted of only roast chicken which I must say, looks pleasing to the eye but was rather disappointing when I took the first bite. My question is, where is the roast beef????Another example of below average quality is the vanilla sauce for the bread and butter pudding. Tasted more like condense milk than vanilla sauce and don't get me started on the pudding itself.The dim sum was only so so and the Siew Mai tasted like the frozen variety that you get from the supermarketHave been to a few Shangri La eating establishments in the region and I must say that The Line when compared to the likes of Satoo in Shangri La Jakarta or Circles in Makati Philippines ranks right at the bottom of the pile.All I can say is, been there, done that, and never again
4
It has always been one of the buffet restaurants I wanted to check out. Even though the buffet isn't exactly affordable, The Line remains as one of Singapore's favourite destinations for buffet lunch and dinner. Started off w chilled fresh prawns, mussels, clams, crabs & very fresh oysters where they open e shell right in front of you. Besides the seafood spread, the Japanese counter is the next most popular counter in The Line. Fresh! I'm impressed by the spread of selections, Sushi, Maki, cha soba, sashimi, tuna sashimi, tempura - you name it. Overall, all of them tasted really good and good service provided!I must say The Line has pretty impressive array of desserts lined up and it definitely satisfy a sweet tooth person like myself - worthy bites such as Lemon Meringue Tart, Creme Brulee & Carrot Cake. I must say this is one of the best desserts lined up I ever had in a buffet.From fruits, warm desserts and a variety of ice creams and toppings to pick from. They've a very wide selection in their buffet lines for an international buffet. There's definitely plenty of choices for everyone to choose from - from your local dishes to fresh seafood, Japanese delight, dim sum, Indian cuisine, western dishes, local kuehs and very delicate desserts. I can't find any reason not to come back to The Line again. http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2014/01/the-line-buffet-shangri-la-hotel.htm
5
Tonnes of food available and you are spoil for choices here. There's prata to mee hoon soup and tim sum to porriage. Not forgetting the usual american breakfast of bacon, baked beans and omelette.
Have a hearty and full breakfast, and you'll definitely skip lunch!
5
The theatre kitchens are fantastic! Food from all over the world prepared before your eyes. The buffet deal is great value for money and allows you to sample the whole range on offer, some of which you may never have seen before.

Before going to this international buffet restaurant I had a very high expetation. A lot of people told me how great was the spread, how warm was the atmosphere and what a cozy enviroment I will find at "The Line". Well. It didn't happen. Readers can see attached, some pictures taken during my dining experience. We were forced to squeeze into a small jetstart style table. Nothing wrong with Jetstar, a low budget company where you get what you pay for. The problem is in our case we were paying Shangri-la and we ended up with low quality standards.Below some info about the restaurant:- Price after discount is 72 S$ per person (discount available 15% with DBS/POSB).- Inside and outside option to dine. If you must go I personally recommend the ourdoor, it has a picturesque view.- Non halal certified.- Terrible deco. Plastic orange lamps, orange paper table mats, faux leather chairs and tired, old carpet reminded me of the 70's movies.- No drinks included with the price beside ice water, coffee and tea from the buffet. There is a free flow package for 27 S$ (if I remember correctly).- Restaurant was over packed. No space to walk in between the tables (check picture attached) and the staff added banquet tables to increase the restaurant capacity. The impression was that Shangri-la lately is more focussing on revenue instead of standards. It's a risky path for the one who wants to be a leader in this industry
5
I'm a long time guest of this restaurant and over the years I always enjoed their seafood selection on the buffet.From lobster to crab and mussels they have it all!Very good as well the pastry display and the local food!Surely worth a visit
5
When I first entered the restaurant, I was amazed at the "big maze". One would be spoilt with choice as there's a wide variety of food to choose from the 16 culinary stations and every station is equally attractive and tantalizing. There's plenty of seafood, sushi, satay, salad; just to name a few. Make sure you visit the place with an empty stomach as there's just too much to eat! What I like most is the oysters. They are very fresh and so fresh that they're best eaten without any condiments. The huge spread of desserts are simply yummy. Its a must to try the chocolate mousse, chocolate cake and tiramisu. There are simply irresistible
3
This is the first time i been The Line Shangrila Singapore for buffet.Reason being of chosen to have brunch buffet there by seeing the reviews from the net of good spread of foods and desserts, which infact thats is kinda disappointed, with the value of money which it charged.Spread of desserts are kind of limited, so do not enjoyed much. Food wise, my rating will be "Average", which i may wish to drop by to another hotel/restaurant to search for better buffet.Overall, first timer may try as different people having different views and ratings
1
If you like a noisy lunch, shopping mall like cafeteria, univerity atmosphere or club med, modern plastic feeling chairs, table, fighting for your glass of champagne, for the plates to be removed between dishes... That's the place to go !!Food so so. I could not taste my favorite, Oysters, short supply, I gave up.No cheese, or insignificant choose of awful processed cheese
3
I find the brunch a little pricey particularly when you have to rush to finish on a Sunday. In fairness to the management, they have taken note but it was the one negative part of the stay.Roast beef slice offered was not the best. Care should be taken to present customer with qualitybefitting the status of this fine hotel
3
Nice place to have international buffet, pretty impressive range of food, definitely able to satisfy most craves. Waiters does not show alot of initiative, the sashimi bar chef is very unfriendly showed displeasure when me & my wife asked for a larger portion of sashimi... He did not want to serve me when i went for more sashimi & he signalled to his "junior" to serve me instead. On the whole, go there for food, dun expect too much in terms of service standards..

Went this weekend for buffet breakfast as this had been one of our favourites before going overseas.Didn't start well, as I know this restaurant can be busy, I tried to make a reservation only to be directed to a voice mail informing that restaurant reservations were closed and to book online which I couldn't do for breakfast. This happened by going both to the restaurants direct line and also the hotel switchboard. On the third attempt I explained the problem to the hotel operator who did assist and arranged for somebody to call back. This shouldn't happen in five star hotelsFood choice is still very good and everyone found their favourites as they have a good blend between western and Asian cuisine. Service though has deteriorated as we had to ask on several occasions for the table to be cleared, seemed they were preoccupied despite the restaurant not being full...which is a shame as I can recall many times wanting to go to the Shang as good service was a defining factor vis a vis other hotels
5
Good eats, from several different cuisines. Too many people in too small a space makes for traffic jams around food and constant bumping into customers on way to and from.
4
The buffet style dinner offers a tremendous variety. At the same time there are big number of people, so nothing for a quiet evening, but great for active evening with as much friends as possible.
4
We went to this buffet restaurant for our team lunch, one of us is a vegetarian yet everyone in the team were able to enjoy their lunch. The restaurant has a wide spread of selection from cold bar seafood, Japanese food, Tim Sum, Indian food, which some of them are vegetarian, local Delight like Laksa, fishball noodle etc, There also have a grilled meat section and some wok specialities area. Salad bar and wide range of dessert counter which consist of kueh kueh, cakes, ice-cream and chocolate fondue Location: It located at the far end of Orchard Road, hence you can either take a cab to the restaurant or take a train to Orchard MRT station take walk about 20 minutes which I did, but I do not recommend it as it quite a walking distance, furthermore walking under a hot sun is no joke.Best Timing:I will recommend you go for their Lunch buffet, it much more cheaper than the dinner price. and please go to the website to check any online offer, for example, it will cost you $36++ per person if you book online instead of $49++, however the offer will depend whether it has been fully taken up for that day, next check any credit card promotion like dine 3 and 1 get free for their meal.What to eat:Everythings if you stomach able to fill in all. If not, start with sashimi and sushi, although not very wide variety to choose, it very fresh. FYI, you can informed the staff how many piece of sashimi you want for each type of fish. Next go for the cold bar like Oyster, mussels, crab etc, really value for money. Next go for the porridge (are you kidding, yes the porridge is nice!) and satay which I personally felt it very tasty. Please keep some space for the ice cream and dessert. There are many malay style kueh kueh (dessert) and cakes to choose upon, it really heaven for the one who has sweet tooth. You may wish to try out the crepe too. After the meal, do have a taste of nice local coffee or tea. Things that I think can be improved:The tempura section, the selection is very limited and I cant see any tempura prawn and the quality is not really up to my standard. Next there are no free soft drinks provided which I think they should. Tips:Ask for a indoor seat, it really uncomfortable to eat in the outdoor area even it under shelter and fan provided. As I am a buffet person, I alway recommend my friends to start with small portion of every dishes the restaurant have, after tasted all the dishes then go for the one you like or perfer in your 2nd round eating, always leave all the carbo stuffs to the very last few dishes and please dont forget to leave some space for the dessert. Overall view:I personally felt it worth for money for the quality and wide selection of international spread. I definitely will go back again in the near futre Please give me a helpful vote if the above information do help

I'm not fond of buffets because its an array of mediocre food. A huge selection but not one will stand out. But my friends enjoy going to The Line so I go for the company. If you find yourself in this place, suggest you go for the cold bar --- oysters, mussels --- fresh because of the high turn over. For the Japanese bar, just get the salmon sushi --- the rest are just stomach fillers. The Chinese bar is the most decent -- don't even try the Indian bar -- the naan and roti are stone cold. There was a long line for the grilled meat so I thought this was the highlight. I realized that the long line was because the server cuts the meat in sloooooow motion. The quality of service has declined considerably --- I didn't feel like I was in a hotel and felt like I was in a cheap restaurant with servers who could not speak english

We reserved a corner of the hotel to celebrate our grandmother's 90th birthday. The tables were rather spacious, we didn't have to worry about not being able to have 2 plates on the table at once. The seating, however, was a little cramped.There was a great spread of food, ranging from noodles, roast meat, indian food, satay, wok specialties, fried food, sashimi/sushi, salad & best of all, they have a counter that serves a delightful selection of tea. I really loved their Chamomile & Peppermint. Earl Grey was average though. Chili crab was fresh but quite salty. Oh, & there were 2 big counters for desserts- 1 for cakes & kueh (they weren't very nice though), the other for teppanyaki ice-cream & chocolate fondue. I highly recommend the Caramel Banana + Nutella crepe. It sent me to heaven :DOverall, if you're looking for a multi-racial spread, I think this definitely is the place to go

we visited this place for breakfast on mother's day before heading off to zoo. it was a huge buffet with variety of cuisine, with one of us following vegetarian diet, this was a good option. there food was great. the staff was helpful and making reservation was easy. this is one place i would bring my overseas guest without having to worry about much

I need to feed a crowd of 30 from various countries (from India, Indonesia, local, Japanese, Philippines, to UK) in my department for a dinner, choosing the right place to eat is a typical challenge due to the various dietary preferences and requirements.Alas...this restaurant came up on the top of the selection list...it was a nice setup and we occupied the whole section that is right in-front of the drinks bar with the waiter/waitress proactively filling up the cups with red/white wine, champagne, beer, .... maybe that's the reason why I didn't get any complains ... :) Behind us is the wide selection of international food ranging from the delicious herbal soup with drunken prawns to warm your tummy, nicely bbq satay, freshly cut salmon Japanese sashimi, range of shell sea catch from oyster, clams to crabs & lobsters, less adventurous western guests can still go with the delicious pasta to western cut, you can also find proper closure to your meal with western to chinese desserts. Since it's the mid-autum season now, moon cake is also served.Check out the website for the various online promotions, this time round, I was not feeling as guilty when I submit my claims because I've got a 25% off the bill through the online reservation ... ;pOh by the way, if anyone drives, you can ask for the complimentary car park ticket... :

Went again to the Line for a birthday buffet lunch, and was grateful that the standard has not degraded over the years. The buffet at the Line is easily one of the best value for money East-West buffets in Singapore, although I might add that this is probably true for the weekday lunches where it is relatively cheap, and no-frills. The specialty luncheons and dinners are a bit too pricey for my liking.Food is of excellent quality and spread, and is promptly replenished. Our birthday lunch came with a complimentary chocolate cake for the birthday girl. Will certainly be back
5
The buffet spread at The Line, Shangri-La Hotel, is truly exemplary! Firstly, the quality of the food is really good (judging from the unlimited and succulent fresh oysters and sashimi). Secondly, from Japanese to Thai, Indian to Asian, and American to Australian, you bet the selection of food is quite endless! Most of the 5 star hotels in Singapore had done away with fresh oysters for weekday lunches with increasingly discerning customers but The Line is still offering them along with other cold seafood selections. Compared to Todai at MBS, where the server actually 'rationed' the fresh oysters for each customer, here at The Line you can eat to your heart's content and nobody will give you 'that look'! All these and more for only $50 per person (tax included) on week days. Make sure you make your reservations a few days in advance as it is always full to the brim. The friendly customer service also makes the whole dining experience very enjoyable. I thought it is also a very pleasant gesture to ask if anybody is celebrating his/her birthday before we ask for the bill. If it is your birthday, The Line will also extend you a small birthday cake on the house, which you could bring home if you are too full by the end of the feast! I strongly recommend The Line for both tourists and Singaporeans

On a business trip to Singapore, went to the Line at the Shangri La Hotel for dinner. Hart sank when I realised it was a buffet, my least favoured ambience for a meal, but I needn't have worried. The food, spanning Italian to Thai and many in between, was all freshly prepared before your very eyes, not standing there for ever begging to be eaten, the normal form for buffets. The staff were pleasant and efficient, the ambience, if a little noisy, is modern, attractive and well-appointed. Well worth a visit when in Si galore, particularly if your visit is short: this pleasant place gives you an opportunity to try several Eastern cuisines in one evening
5
Great place to have your noodles in the morning. Both my Daughters, 3 and 6 have noodles for breakfast. Who would think that for these 2 little European children
5
The Line has an outstanding selection of food for breakfast. Almost everything you could want from European and Asian is here.
4
Excellent option for kids. Great variety of dishes. dinner is expensive though. They wanted to charge me S$95++ for the buffet for my 12 year old!

Came for the Sunday brunch on 1 Sept. Food range was good. Quality of food was above average though nothing in particular stood out in comparison to other available Sunday brunches. The balloon sculpting man who went around the tables was a nice touch for kids and adults alike. If you are expecting service befitting the Shangri-la brand, you are likely to be disappointed. Inattentive service staff who had to be reminded to refill drinks and remove used cutlery. Eventually, found a spot on my table to stack the plates till they were ready to clear them. Hot chocolate order took 3 reminders before it arrived. Some service staff were clearly not trained to open champagne bottles. So don't be surprised if a cork comes flying to your table as it did when I was dining there. Overall, if you are just looking for food, it is a fairly decent place. If you are expecting great service, don't bother, especially on a crowded Sunday
5
I stayed with the family at the Shangri-La and had breakfast here every single day for nearly 3 weeks. Great choice, friendly staff, lovely food. If I lived in Singapore I would treat the family to a monthly brunch here. I'm already missing my Line breakfast
4
The Dinner Buffet is very extensive with the cold seafood and Japanese stations being the highlight and you are likely to visit them for seconds. Hot selection is so so with plenty to choose from but nothing with a wow factor. Desserts are again superb and plenty to choose from to load on Calories.Service is efficient and what to be expected at a glamorous Coffee Shop
4
Sunday Brunch here is a Must tryWith free flow champagne, and a big spread, this is one of the must try and eat buffets in Singapore. With Japanese Sushi, Indian, Western and local delights, this buffet has got everything to satisfy your pallete. I liked the Laksa and the Prawn Noodle Broth, which was as good as those found in the top local shops outside. Only drawback was the poor service as highlighted by others. You kind of expect more, when you are paying a premium price for the food

Celebrated my daughter's birthday there last Sunday. Chosen this place because of the reviews on the Internet saying it's the No. 1 Buffet in town. Seriously, we have been to better ones...Firstly, we were told the lunch buffet is more expensive than the dinner because of the Boston Lobster. Secondly, we expect better service from a 5-Stars Hotel. Disappointing to Both! The lobsters were not tasty, slightly overcooked and hard to bite. The restaurant was understaffed and we have to look for waiters all over the place to clear the plates which were piled up all over the table. Drinks were also not served. When we finally found one waiter, we were told that he could not help us because he was busy before another one came along much later to finally take our drinks' order. When it was time to refill our ice-water, we again have to walk around to look for Available Waiters. After talking to the 3rd waiter then we managed to get the water refilled. Went round the whole buffet area and you could hardly find One Chef/Service Staff that Smile at you! Almost all of them were Black-Faced especially at the Sashimi Counter, the Chef looked at you as if you were troubling him to cut you the fish! For goodness sake, we do not pay Cheap to eat there. it's over $100 each person. I was asked during reservation if there was a special occasion and I told the lady we were celebrating our daughter's birthday. She then informed me that it was noted. We were expecting probably a cake to be brought out during our lunch to surprise my daughter but nothing came until we asked for the bill and then the waiter asked us if we wanted to bring a cake home??? This is the SERVICE at the so-called NO. 1 best buffet in town at a 5-Stars World Reputable Hotel
3
We only ate once at the Line, for breakfast and we were totally unimpressed. Although there was a large choice, it is very noisy and as others have said, service is quite poor. There seems to be a total lack of staff control and we asked three times for coffee which when it did arrive was only luke warm. The atmosphere is very formica and lacking in style, sort of modern cafeteria style.It just did nothing for us and I would never bother returning
5
I have stayed at the Shangri la many times and if your find yourself here you must try the Buffet lunch or Dinner at the Line restaurant â€“ respectively at US$30 and 36 Plus service Charge and tax - it is absolutely spectacular and well worth the money. If there is something to rave about than it is the Dinner buffet so do not miss out on it. It has absolutely everything from freshly shelled oysters, crab, seafood . Sashimi and Sushi, Indian delicacies with chicken Tikka and Nan bread prepared in a clay oven right there in front of you .. salads .. international and Asian cuisine and a desert bar to die for including a molten chocolate fountain
5
Favorite weekend buffet in Singapore. Huge selection of different cuisines to choose from. Excellent seafood selection and great desserts.
2
I went they with my friends, given a farewell treat to him. I'm very disappointed with the food. I will never go back again.
5
The best seafood buffet in Singapore bar none. Fresh selection of Oysters, king crabs, etc. Most cooking tends towards Asian cooking methods but extremely prepared and presented. Reserve early for peak times.
4
One of the best and most expansive buffets I have encountered. Service is good although the drinks service is limited.
4
Breakfast was great here with a whole lot of international choices with lots of fruits as well. Particularly interesting is the coffee bar. Try it for the singapore kopi & the tarik experience within the hotel.
5
Visited The Line for a second time this year and have to say it was just as brilliant as last time I visited in April. Had the signature dinner buffet and as it was a Tuesday night they also offer unlimited beer and wine as part of the $100 buffet which we always consider good value considering the quality of food available.I highly recommend The Line to anyone visiting Singapore
2
The Line used to be my go-to place if I ever craved the variety of a buffet, but no longer. My last visit over the weekend, I found the place to be overly crowded - this was not the case a few years ago. Moving around the food aisles is rather difficult, and there is a wait at every food station. For a lower end buffet, that might be acceptable, but not for Shangri La. Food-wise, the quality seems to have suffered. Alaskan crab legs are offered, but no scissors for the crab legs are available (we asked the waiting staff and they told us they do not have the scissors, and can only give us a nutcracker/crab pincer cracker instead). That is insincerity with the service - if you put something on offer, provide the tools to eat it. The desserts have also suffered a decrease in quality; what used to be baked whole cakes that made me think Shangri La's cake chefs are amazing, now are pedestrian cake bites which taste of mass factory-made cakes for caterers. At $55 for weekend lunch, I would not consider a revisit until things have changed

Ok - I am actually a pretty loyal shangri la member (love the perks of the golden circle) so I always try to stay in one wherever I can.This one isn't anything close to ones I stayed in (aside from the Qingdao one which is a complete disaster). Location wise is not bad and I guess rather convenient. But the rooms etc. not great and in my mind up to Singapore standards.A few positives before I go to the negatives:1) rooms are spacious2) buffet not bad (in terms of varieties)3) conference facilities quite good4) views ok5) good sunlight in the room(Can sense that I am squeezing out positives?)Not to the negatives1) rooms are old! I'm not comparing this to china world summit won't (which I think is amazing) but really too old for the modern days2) sound proof in the room really bad3) the cable tv is sooooo bad! Lack of options and key channels. I was here during the confed cup final, took forever to find a channel with a live match on with poor quality. None of those typical series channels or movies channels - the movies they play reminds one of the age of this hotel?4) taxi - probably not the hotel's fault, but you can never get one when you want. And definitely don't see the hotel guests priority being implemented.5) this is just me but I like swimming laps - the pool is great fun for family but really hard for you to swim laps...In general - maybe I'm too hard on this (but I am a real fan of shangri la so I have high standards maybe?) and it's comfortable. I am on my second week here now and im love ok. But definitely room for improvements (fix the tv channels first).

Landi and her team of excellence be it breakfast lunch and or dinner in the evening The breakfast bar team how do they keep smiling at that hour of the morning full of life , no matter how many times you return the all have a very good morning for you

I never write reviews, but I have taken to tripadvisor to mourn what used to be my favourite restaurant IN THE WORLD (and I am well-traveled). Granted, I have been frequenting the Line since its opening week in 2005, and let me say, it was THE BEST restaurant I had ever eaten at. The quality for price of the food was unparalleled and our family made it a point to return at least once a month while we stayed across the street, and on every special occasion after we moved away thereon. However, the visits reduced to about once a year when we moved to europe, and having been back twice in the last two years, I couldn't find a way to sufficiently express my disappointment.The service had suffered enormously (after that friendly german restaurant manager, or some sort of head-of-staff, disappeared), the quality of the food had deteriorated to the extent where it was just about worth the original price and the prices had sky-rocketed. It broke my heart when I made the decision to not return after my last lunch experience here, where we were bluntly seated outside, despite requesting an inside table at the time of reservation, and proceeded to be ignored by the waiting staff, while birds hopped all over the cutlery on the tables. The buffet was abnormally packed with pushy people, eager to get to the seafood, and the experience as a whole was just so disappointing that I firmly believe the Line should either replace its manager (and take drastic measures to improve) or close all-together, letting a new 'Line' whisk away my affections in its place. The reputation has long outlived the restaurant
5
We recently stayed at the Shangrila Apts. & took the deal incl. of Breakfast. The spread is fantastic!!!! The quality of the food& selection, the quality of the service was one of the best I have experienced. Thank you The Line!!!!
5
The food offered is fresh and delicious. There are a wide variety of food. I especially like the crepe which is prepared on the spot and the sauces available. The sushi is fresh too. A bit pricey but you pay for the quality of food.
5
The line has one of the best buffet in Singapore which consists of 16 cooking stations. This restaurant is very popular and gets very busy between 7-8pm. If you decide to go to this restaurant which is well worth it I would advise that unless you have youngsters it is best to go after 8p
5
The shangri-la Singapore is a very old hotel as u can tell by the decor and its hard wares . But the restaurant is very impressive! I had an amazing lunch experience at The Line restaurant, which offers lots of Asian cuisine that incorporates the country's traditions, plus a wide selection of fresh seafoods like lobster, salmon and Oysters!!!The restaurant has a very good local reputation.... Maybe that's why it's always full, and you need to make a reservation in advance
5
The most magnificent breakfast in the world - fresh fruit, beautiful fresh squeezed juices, eggs and omelettes made to your specific taste and requirements, fresh bread baked on site, pastries to die for, better English breakfasts than the English can do and an exotic, tantalising and authentic array if Chinese dishes, including fantastic dim sum - where do we get breakfasts like tat in the s, Europe, the UK or Australia
4
When to this restaurant somewhere in April 2013. The restaurant was packed on a Friday night. Highly recommend to make reservation before coming here. I am not a big fan of oysters but took one and it was very good and fresh. The oysters are open on-the-spot and there is a long queue for it. The sashimi section was also fantastic. They have salmon, tuna, yellow tail and so on. My favorite is salmon and is also cut on-the-spot and much better than those found in Sushi Tei. The Indian section was great as well, especially the butter curry. They also serve satay (beef, chicken and mutton). Before desert, my stomach nearly bust but manage to squish in some cheese cakes with a glass to the tarik to push it down â€¦. yummy.and for those who smoke ... there is a smoking place just outside the side door of the restaurant
4
We ate here a few times for breakfast and once for dinner during our stay at the Shangri-La Apartments. The spread is quite good although the one time we went on a Sunday morning it seemed better than the other days. Service is good and although it is busy, it never feels overly crowded. The cappuccinos are excellent. It's a decent buffet overall although I've been to better even at other Shangri-La hotels.
4
Good hotel restaurant. Was in the mood for a "non-Asian" meal, just needed another taste. Had some great, continental cuisine to choose from including pasta. The pasta was so good, i got the same thing the next day! Definitely not a quiet place, was very busy and loud, but fine for a quick lunch or breakfast. Nice decor, very modern compared to the rest of the hote
4
Spacious casual ambience with a great buffet and ala carte selection. The fresh seafood section was exceptionally good - crab, oysters, shrimp and more. Local selection esp laksa was of good standard. Nice range of ice cream flavours. Green tea was great. Try the sago gula Melaka with a scoop of coconut ice cream - unforgettable!Nasi goreng and spinach ravioli from the ala carte menu was quite good. I recommend rose and vanilla tea - fragrant and refreshing. My daughter inadvertently left her handbag behind and we promptly were called by the staff. Very professional and helpful! Thank you.
4
You can eat all you wish at this canteen style buffet restaurant - and the choice of food amazing, from Oysters to Crispy Duck.You can if you wish eat A La Carte and this what we chose to do - we had a three course meal with an ordinary bottle of French Rose wine. The food was excellent, the steaks fine and the desert's in particular delicious, but the bill was S$400 - which is an awful lot of money for a meal served up in a canteen style restaurant surrounded by maybe 200 people constantly selecting different courses. Recommend that you take the buffet choice!!! You need to book for a table as it is very popular
4
Great food, wide range of choices. Restaurant a little noisy. Service on the patio not always as quick as service inside.
5
This buffet restaurant features food from all the major cuisines, from Indian to Western and everything in between. You can sit indoors or out. We aren't morning people so all those choices were a bit overwhelming so we usually ate at the Waterfall.
5
One of the largest and high quality spreads I've ever seen and tasted. Excellent desserts. I have recommended The Line to friends and will go again next time I visit Singapore.
5
For $80 sgd for adults, $30 sgd for children and free for 5 and under you receive an expansive buffet and all you can drink beer and wine. There must be over 100 food options incl a large Indian section, sashimi, sushi, fresh seafood, pizzas, pasta, Chinese, laksa, barista, desserts, Thai, carvery and more. It is busy and loud so not a romantic location for a couple, but a chance for fantastic food in a family and group friendly environment
5
This place is something else! For about $100 sing you can eat all that you can handle plus if you come on a Tuesday that includes white wine, Red wine and Beer. Every type of food pretty much is here! Japanese, Indian, Chinese, local, the list goes on.. Food is regularly replenished so you dont need to worry about a queue of people in front of you taking everything. The usual favourites are of course popular, things like fresh sashimi, lobster and Duck dishes.I cant recommend this place enough. Truely a wonderful experience
5
Breakfast buffets leave me ambivalent with their standard eggs, beans, bacon, and sausage. Those restaurants could take a lesson from the Shangri La Hotel, whose buffet is fabulous. Yes, they have the standard breakfast, though it is far above "standard" in taste and presentation, but that is only one corner of the selection. There is a dim sum section, a congee section, an Indian Pratt section, a pastries section, a fruit area, pancakes and waffles, and a couple of other sections that I couldn't Identify. We had a combination of dim sum, which was top notch, and fruit. The fruit was likely tree-ripened, as it was quite flavourful. Service was excellent, with the offer of black coffee or specialty coffees. If I had my doubts about eating at the hotel, this certainly changed my mind. I plan to eat here every morning
5
Shangri-la Hotel Singapore has always been known for its exceptional service and my experience at The Line was no exception.To celebrate my partner's birthday, I made a Sunday champagne lunch reservation for 2. Upon being seated, I was told there were 2 pricing, one that came with alcohol and the other without. As we chose one of each, our lunch came accompanied with champagne and mango juice (or soft drink, if preferred). The spread was sumptuous and plenty. It seems open kitchens are all the rage nowadays, so the concept at The Line was nothing new. Counters were divided into Japanese, Indian, Local and Italian cuisine. There was also a dessert section and another for tea and coffee.What stood out was the level of attention and care accorded to patrons. Although obviously busy, our table was promptly attended to without having to call attention to the staff. I mentioned earlier that a birthday celebration was in order, and so a surprise arrived at our table when we got down to dessert.The Line, in my opinion, is highly recommended, not only for its food and most memorably, its service.
4
We dine on Sunday dinner. Restaurant was full house.We decide to book an outdoor thought to have a pool view but the outdoor seating was blocked by the plants.We were escort to our designated table. They were using banquet chair for some of the outdoor tables, but the Chair cover was torn. Floor fill with few packet individual butter waste seems is from the morning and the floor was not being cleaned up. Cleanliness disappointed us as the Line at the hotel should have this problem.Table setup was simple. The servers was prompt beginning of the dining but after 2100 hrs, the service stops, hardly to spot servers in the dining hall. Some of the table even guest leave for more than hour all the dirty plates and glasses still lying on the table.Food variety very great. But the Chinese roasted section the food being serve room temperature, I was hoping warm or hot, the oyster were great, but the chef a bit slow during the peak hours.Great selection of salads, but no food tag on it, make me confuse especially the dressing.Dessert was great but all item was shobet no milk based ice cream. Overall still ok
4
Was there yesterday. Second time there for lunch. There are various food stations - seafood; Japanese; Chinese; Indian; Italian; local; salads; desserts and drinks. Save lots of space for food as the variety is so attractive you want to eat them all! I feel sorry for the guys shucking oysters non stop and the one grilling the satay. Each time they place the food on the plate, they will all be taken up! Same for the guy serving the sashimi. It was a never ending queue for that one.
4
This is my second visit to The Line, but first time for a dinner buffet. We were there early at 6.30pm and there was just a handful of guests. They had a pretty good spread for a buffet - from fresh seafood, Japanese counter, salad counter, Chinese counter, Indian counter etc. I started the buffet with fresh oysters and sashimi. The seafood were all very fresh and that's one of the most important things that I look for in a buffet, so that's good.I tried the Indian food and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The curry, dhal, prata and satays were excellent. There was only one thing that I wasn't quite sure about - the naan. It was hard and difficult to bite on to. I enjoyed the Dim Sum counter - especially the soup that night. It was so good that I had 3 bowls of it. All of the 'hot' food counters were pretty good, except that I wished some of the food could be served warm. I understand that it is a buffet and it would be quite difficult to serve everything warm. I tried the roast pork but was disappointed as it was so cold. Some of the fried food like calamari were also cold (not warm) anymore.One of the best things about The Line is their dessert counter. They have such a wide selection of cakes and desserts for you to choose from. My favorite was definitely the mini Creme Brûlée. That's a must-try! Beside the dessert counter, there was also a counter serving teh tarikh and I had to try it. Surprisingly, it was not bad. Of course it didn't taste like the authentic teh tarikh you get outside but it was acceptable.All in all, I had a good experience at The Line. Service was swift, polite and great. They actually prepared a complimentary mini birthday cake for me as a surprise. The staff were very attentive too. Dirty plates and cutlery were cleared within seconds without having to ask the staff to do so.Will definitely head back to The Line again

Nice buffet with good selection of western, local, Japanese foods. Can never eat as much as we like! Best is the discount you get when booking early on line for weekdays.
4
There are various kinds of sweets.
They are all delicious.
The sweets are the best of all the foods in this restaurant.
The place is always crowded.
There are too many tables for its space.
5
101 dishes , prepared to perfection. From Indian to Oriental, from french toast to Bacon and Egg's. Professional and service oriented.
4
Love the oyster, ambience and the overall food. Been there many times. Great place for spend time with friends and have a long lunch or dinner. The only problem is the oyster come out slow esp. at peak hours.
4
The Line must offer the most extensive buffet breakfast anywhere in the world. With some many stations and options, one could spend hours over breakfast and easily spill over into lunch. Choices, choices! Generally the food is all very good alhough the local options could be more authentic. The ability to sit outdoors amongst the kush vegetation is a real treat.

As we had checked in late to the Shangri-La and were hungry, we went to their casual eatery called The Line and ordered a couple of items before 11 p.m. Seemed like we waited a long time for the food to arrive and when it did the wonton soup my husband had ordered was barely warm – like it had sat for a while. Wouldn’t think that would happen at a place with Shangri-La’s reputation

We organised for my birthday brunch to be at The Line as we have tried numerous champagne brunches in Singapore and wanted to keep searching for 'the best'. Unfortunately The Line at Shangri La falls well under par in comparison to the other 5* hotel brunches in Singapore.Service: Firstly, you have to queue up to get in. Once seated at we had to wait 15 minutes to get a glass of water, when we have paid for free flow champagne. We requested our drinks from no less than 3 waiters, and even the ‘manager’ who told us that ‘the buffet is already open, you can go and eat…’. When you pay the price of the brunch and you are there to celebrate, you want to toast with your friends, you want champagne. I tried to explain this to the manager to which he responded by walking away in the opposite direction. Eventually at 12.25 we got our first glass of champagne- well 7 of the 8 of us did. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get the final glass! The champagne certainly did not flow during the meal which didn’t help the atmosphere after the earlier upset. The one save in grace on the service front was the waiter from the outside area Gaurav- he spotted from the outside that we were trying to get served for quite some time, he instinctively brought in a bottle to top up our glasses at the end of the buffet time, with a huge welcoming smile to match. If it hadn’t been for gracious attitude we would have left entirely disappointed. The food: The food is below par in terms of selection and quality compared to other champagne buffets at the same price in Singapore. The seafood selection of oysters, lobster tail and sushi is adequate but be prepared to queue and bustle like at a market. There is a good selection of Indian food but unfortunately the meat skewers were very dried and wrinkled by the time we got to the taste was not as flavoursome with Indian spices as one would expect. Whilst the rib of beef was the tastiest item on the buffet, the Yorkshire puddings were tasteless and overcooked with watery gravy. The main disappointment for us was the cheese selection- there were only 3 types of cheeses (a cheddar, brie and a blue) on offer and a couple of breads- no apricots, nuts or seeds to accompany either. The desert cake selection was the standard offering of Singapore- tasteless. The one surprise was the strawberry ice cream, this I recommend. They were creating crepes on the spot which I can image will please people who bring their children along.Atmosphere: The Line restaurant is a large open concept, largely in white, it is bright and airy. There is a nice ambient temperature which is unusual for Singapore which is usually too cold inside. The atmosphere is a typical breakfast buffet hotel feel not a indulgent lunch, the main disappointment was that we ate off paper placemats and had no coasters for our glasses. There were also no table clothes on the tables and some of them were quite worn with mine having been part melted on the corner. If you are planning on a light lunch date I think this would suit better than for a champagne brunch.Over all we were quite underwhelmed by our time at The Line, maybe because we have been spoilt by the quality, choice and service of other 5* hotel buffets in Singapore, at comparable price- therefore given the choice I will try somewhere else next time and skip ‘The Line’

We went for my partners birthday. Excellent oysters, great sashimi, but tough lobster.Very good salmon with rock salt and superb choice of salads. Good selection of cheeses and dried fruit and nuts too. The Indian buffet was much enjoyed by the birthday boy.Excellent free flow wine. When staff realised it was a birthday they offered to sing. My partner said No! But they brought a delicious chocolate cake, complete with candle. It was superb and we brought some home, as we had already enjoyed the selection of puddings and gorgeous fresh passion fruit.Good old Line, it did not disappoint
3
Food great, with a wonderful selection of dishes. Drinks can however be eye wateringly expensive. On some nights they have a "free pour" type arrangement where you can get drinks for a set price - it is worth asking.The place can however get very crowded and the replenishment of food sometimes has difficulty in keeping up.Overall OK but not spectacular
2
Good food, atmosphere and service; fun evening with the wife. When settling the bill, the visa card mysteriously kept bouncing. No worries; just pay with NETS right? Only the most common way to pay in Singapore ... not accepted by The Line. Had to walk to Orchard Towers and back for an ATM. Great way to ruin a perfectly good evening. Still cannot believe card or cash the only two options at such a big place as Shangri La.
4
Was there to celebrate son's birthday
Service was great, staffs were friendly
Love the ambience too
But would prefer to reserve for special occasions
3
Many of my friends recommend this buffet, however i found it ok only. Perhaps I set a high expectation after so many recommendation from friends around.
The location of the hotel is a bit difficult to visit if you are taking public transport.
5
One of the best buffet in singapore. Me and my wife went there for champagne brunch. The food is delicious and the service is very good too. The desserts was equally wonderful. Would definitely come back.
4
so much selection so little time. breakfast has a selection of no less than 15 pastries and a mimosa bar!
lunch has western, Indian, Chinese, a noodle station, fresh seafood...and a chocolate fountain at dessert!
pace yourself here!
5
There were so many options, and it was all great! I went for breakfast, and was not hungry until dinner!
4
For Sunday brunch and value for money The Line is hard to beat with a great variety of food of excellent quality and above all freshness.It is a personal family favourite.My only comment is that if you forget the name and ask the Shangri-la for their 'coffee shop' when making a booking they can get a bit huffy when they tell you 'we do not have a coffee shop sir,only The Line' but given its quality fair game!
5
Once you get a table the selection for breakfast is great. If it gets crowded dont opt for the pool side cafe unless you just want a light breakfast only. If you wish to dine here, worth booking a place well ahead as it get very popular at weekends esp Sundays and public holidays.
1
I don't understand all of the rave reviews of The Line. We went there for breakfast. It is very average to below average, overly priced hotel buffet food. There are so many better places to eat In Singapore. Maybe if you are a cow and don't know that there is better grass at the farm In the neighboring village you will feel very comfortable here and enjoy the experience. But if you are not a cow, you would probably prefer higher quality breakfast food at a place like Wild Honey
5
I am definitely not a buffer go-er. I find the variety of dishes in the usual buffer place are boring and almost alike. Not to THE LINE, went there the third time in the year, it never let me down, seems like there are always a new food that you could discover in every visit. simply loving it
5
In Singapore, The Line is one of the most worthy place to have your buffet breakfast. Literally, having breakfast like a King! The numerous varieties of spreads are just countless. It is one of the best breakfast place I have tried in Singapore hotels. In door and out door seatings at your requests. Personally prefers the outdoor seating as i can relax and enjoy me breakfast with it's garden / pool scenery. The quality of food is exceptional and staffs are attentive and helpful. Was attended to the moment I walked in and was seated in less than a minute. All in all, the pastries to the fruits were all amazing and loved its quality. For those of you who would have a glass or two bubbles in the morning like me, would topped everything up
4
Good selection of hot foods and I love their dessert spreads!!!! From fruits, kuehs, ice creams, sweets, cakes, shooters ... Oh so yummy = I'm in dessert haven!
Book online, sometimes they have pretty good discounts!
4
Fabulous food... Plenty of choices on the buffet for dinner. Spent a bit more on the free pour for champagne. Great value. Highly recommend an evening there, but sit outside on the terrace where it is not so busy.
5
So many dishes to choose from on the ethnic buffet lines. Friendly staff, super clean and efficient. Great breakfast experience. Loved it during all five days here.
5
The sheer variety at breakfast is fantastic. Tastes to suit every palate and every dietary requirement. You cant go wrong at the Line. Very helpful staff.
5
Best breakfast ever. the restaurant is very cool and ORANGE. It is modern, fresh and wonderful. The laksa is fabulous.
5
Great food all over with a fantastic variation of food. Great crew.
Very nice, clean and stylish restaurant at the Shangri La Hotel.
I´ll be back! :)

The Line was recomended by lots of my Singaporean friends and it is now sitting the Top Buffet list of mine. (I not really like buffet, but The Line is totaly a different story)The selection here won't make you Wow (but ofcos more than enough), but the quality of the food will defenately surprise you. I'm a seafood lover, so I went there on a Thursday seafood buffet dinner. The extras for "seafood night" are lobster, champagne, wine, beer & juice (and you r only paying $10 extra). My plates were mostly filled by Lobster, king crab leg, oyster, salmon & tuna sashimi, scallop and all are far above average. Also tried meats & dessert and non 0f them dissapointed me. Lastly not to miss was the rock melon, it just taste like what I had in Australia - fully ripe, juicy and the extreme strong melon smell conclude my dinner perfectly.Tips: book a table through the hotel website, and you can choose certain date which has discount
4
Huge variety on the buffet Layout Sufficient choices for VegetariansModern and bright interiorsTop class service , every staff is always willing to assist as much as possibleThey informed us well in advance of the closing time of the buffet. Variety of dessertsThere was a dripping aircon grill above us and we brought it to the attention of our waiter who was quick to organise a maintenance personnel to clean the grill effectively without hindrance to us.Highly recommended
5
This is a very modern & sleek looking restaurant in the Shangri-La hotel. I am glad we went to check it out while staying at the Shangri-La.We had the dinner buffet at THE LINE and the variety of food was dreamlike!!! So fresh, so good tasting...a meal from heaven!And so many dishes to choose from. I wish I could have eaten more - I wanted to try all these delicious looking things!!! Look at my pictures to get an idea what kind of stuff they served. Again...the food was out of this world!The price for the buffet dinner was 75.- SGD/person.The staff was very, very friendly, professional and helpful.If I ever make it back to Singapore I definitely will come here again
4
When you talk about the spread in a buffet, no place else in Singapore beats The Line @ Shangri-La hotel. Formerly named Coffee Garden before a huge revamp to The Line years ago, the buffet at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore has won many awards for Best Buffet in Singapore. Standards have come off compared to the past in my opinion as we have dined here many times for numerous years, but still it serves up a wicked buffet. If you are starving and have a huge appetite, hit up The Line and eat your heart out as the spread there is incredible
5
An extensive buffet with a wide variety to suit every taste is available or an equally impressive menu is on offer and the food and service is excellent.
5
The Line at Shangri-La Hotel Singapore has got an amazing selection of food. It offers both quality and quantity for breakfast to dinner. The staff is friendly and approachable. Had a really great dining experience.
5
Nothing to dislike about this vibrant restaurant with excellent quality and numerous eclectic options. Better than Straits Kitchen and Billiard Room in my opinion and worth the effort as quite a hike to get there.
5
Have been to the Line more than ten times, as its probably one of the best buffet place in Singapore. Booked on the Shangrila hotel web so got some discount! The seafood section is the best, fresh and delicious. Highly recommended
5
We ate breakfast in the Line most mornings. The quality and variety of food was amazing. We could not help ourselves and ate so much we only managed to have lunch once.
5
Had my birthday dinner celebration with wife at the restaurant. Free flow drinks (Champagne, wine, beer, sparkling sake, juice, soft drinks etc)Sumptious spread of fresh seafood (Freshly shucked Oysters, Scallops, mini lobsters, prawns), Sashimi (Yellow Fin, Salmon etc), pizzas, pastas, Huge Salmon on a platter, Salad/Cheese spread, Indian,desserts etc.Had about almost everything and I must say the highlights are the pretty large oysters, sashimi and fish.Would recommend anyone thinking of heading for a buffet to try it out. You will not regret! Oh yes, check out their Sparkling Sake and 'Teh Tarik'. It is very good
4
Had a buffet dinner at The Line recently with friends and colleagues. Not really the sort of place for a business-related dinner but very good for an informal relaxed meal. Food choices were quite extensive - local, Japanese, Indian, Middle Eastern, Italian and continental, along with the usual salad bar, fruits and desserts. Some local dishes like chicken rice and laksa are prepared on demand and you can watch the chefs getting it ready at the counters. The Japanese & Middle Eastern sections were my favourites - the roasted baby lamb was especially tasty with the super-smooth dips. The desserts were really mouth-watering and the chocolate fountain's probably a hit with the kids.Unfortunately, the service was rather erratic and one of my orders for a fruit juice was forgottem. The restaurant's also really pricey but as long as one is comfortable with the price, it's quite good value
5
Not your usual buffet table spread with different dishes for you to choose from. The food is instead served from individual stalls and you can go back to each stall as often as you want. Great food, great ambience and great way to layout the food. Will definitely visit again
5
Absolutely love the food here. I've had buffets at other hotels but this is the one that does it for me. The oysters are by far, the largest and freshest ones around. Amazing variety of cuisines at lunch hour - I couldn't find the opportunity to try all of them because I was so full by the time I covered three quarters of the buffet stations.Definitely worth every penny for the quality of food. It's crowded for a reason! Online reservations from the hotel's website may get you a discount. Do check
4
The variety of the buffet is good which consist of Indian, Mediterranean, Chinese, Japanese, Singaporean and western dishes. Not forgetting the desserts! The Oysters are big and fresh though, as well as the poached prawns. The sushi is fresh and juicy too. The service wise is pretty standard.The place was so full that you keep knocking onto somebody when i was moving around the buffet table. However, I really think that's a meal of great value
5
Incredible selection. Buffet's here carry selection from all parts of the world.
Tip: the specialty coffee is better, so decline the coffee when they come to the table and go to the coffee location of the buffet for a cappuccino.
5
The buffet is amazing with a large selection of food for every taste. Exceptional service from the staff.
4
Went there with my wife. The variety of food there beyond our expextation, food are nice, the dessert are great, seafood are fresh.
Will definitely suggest the place to others.
4
A busy place,but the waiters/waitresses knock themselves out to help you. Large element of self-service- e.g. toast-juice-bread/butter-some standing in line whilst they cook eggs, but nothing too dramatic (I'm not a person who enjoys standing in line) but the queues were quickly served.
4
This is a buffet restaurant The number of buffets and the types is really wide.
I remember the following: - Indian - Salad - Seafood - Chinese - Desert and there were probably a few more.
4
Amazing buffet spread and food are fresh. (Love the seafoods) Nothing really much to complain about the food they serve.
Only thing is staffs are not that really attentive and are quite slow.
It's kinda overvalue as well, compared to other buffet resto i've been.
4
Great spread Of quality food. Wonderful variety especially the cold and desserts. Had a fantastic time with group of friends.
Note: don't miss the oysters ... Yum :P
5
We had a fabulous buffet. The range and quality of food was amazing and the service was exceptional. Check deals offered through your bank as you could be entitled to a discount.
3
Located in one of the top hotels but not sure if it is one of the top buffets. Carousel and Straits Kitchen offer much better value for money. The most impressive were the desserts and other items were 6/10. Not enough staff to clear the plates fast enough. Expected better quality from a Shangri La's main restaurant
5
Some buffets work on volume and variety over quality. The Line delivers quality as well. If you are pining for a proper British roast, their beef comes with Yorkshire pudding. There is a chocolate fountain to mesmerise the children. Enough good stuff to keep everyone happy
4
Besides coffee being $10 this buffet is fantastic! Incredible assortment of foods from Europe, America, Asia and all things in between. Asian hotels do breakfast well and this is no different.
5
First Class selection of all foods from all over the world some cook to order
4
love the spread and the quality of the food. it's not like there's a huge variety but way more than my tummy can take. yums
5
At first it sounds expensive but the range of food and drinks is great.
Make sure you book online as you can save up to 25%. This makes an all you can eat and drink at less than $70.
2
Very wide selection of very average food!
They do not respond well to negative face to face comments though...
If you are particular about food quality then skip this place!
4
We went to the Line to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Book on line - there's a discount for making your reservation on line. If you love seafood - this will be the place for you. It has great fresh oysters. The japanese station also does freshly cut sashimi of a few different type of fish and octopus. My daughters loved the dessert wall. Cakes and puddings were all lined up. The chocolate fondue fountain had them as soon as we walked in. Overall, not a bad variety of different foods - there will be something to please everyone. Waiters were very attentive, clearing the tables very often and topping up drinks
5
I was very impressed and enjoyed this 5 star dining experience. Amazing thing was, it was not buffet food, it was tasting and prepared as you would get at a 5 star restaurant ordering off the menu. There were areas set up as a market, Indian, Chinese, Indonesian/Malay, Pizza, BBQ, Thai, Salads, Breads, Japanese and Sushi Bar, Seafood (unbelievable selections and quality). Then the Dessert Area is something out of a complete bakery and ice cream shoppe. I really could not believe all the amazing foods available and the tastes and quality of what I had. The Seafood was so excellent and the chefs behind the seafood bar friendly and helpful and getting you the best selections. This is the best dinner buffet I have had anywhere in the world. It is the best you will find. The service was very good but could see the staff stretched as a busy place, but at a buffet you can get some help when your up for your next selection. Amazing!
1
I have been spoiled by the food in KL but came to The Line with some friends to give it a try. We waited for nearly 15 minutes to get a table, and once seated another 20 minutes to order some wine and get it delivered. And then another 10 minutes for an ice bucket. The buffet looked great, very well presented, but the seafood was bland, and there was practically a riot going on with what looked like locals going crazy for the crab. Honestly put me off the place - don't these people understand the concept of dignity...Anyway we filled ourselves, paid the very expense bill and left
4
Good variety for breakfast in the hotel. Juice bar and fresh fruit are the most favorite.Do not forget to order latte. Good presentation.Brunch add choice of free flow champagne for added costDinner add lobster, crab, sashimi, oyster bar. Good quality but nothing to crave about just buffet quality
5
Celebrated Mother's Day at The Line and they had the best sashimi and oysters a buffet line usually offer. Wide variety of food for selection which is finished and topped-up quickly, so you don't see 'almost-stale' food that has been lying in the warmer all day
5
Everything is fresh, varied, well-prepared. Service is attentive, bringing coffee and tea, clearing plates, etc.
5
Breakfast and dinner variety was excellent. Best buffet I had anywhere in the world
4
Well, I guess if you can only have one buffet in singapore, this has to be it. Not because it necessarily serves the best tasting food, but because the selection of food here is quite unmatchable elsewhere in Singapore. You get to choose from Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Western and fresh live seafood! Well, don't forget the desserts and fondue fountain too
4
I had been to The Line twice, 1st for its dinner buffet and 2nd for its lunch buffet 2 years ago. I still can remember the variety of choices they had and I did not manage to try all of them. I like most their dessert portion, the crepe, the coffee and small, well presented dessert corner.The fresh ingredient like prawn was really good, the sushi, the salad. However, I did not much appreciate their cooked Asian food, like stir fry and dim sum. I think that can be better. The bad things of such buffet is I would want to try those food and make myself too full
5
I only had breakfast this trip. There is so many things to try that five days was not enough time to try everything I wanted to. On my last trip, I did have the buffet one evening. It was even more impressive. It has high regards by the Singaporeans
5
Had a gathering there for 50 people as we are getting married this summer. Buffet was endless and incredible food. Service was friendly and they went the extra mile to make sure everything was alright. A lot of us had the free flow beer and wine ($20++ - cheap!) and it was endless, even after 10:30 they kept pouring for us. They even called the next day to make sure we all enjoyed ourselves - you're not finding that level of service everywhere in Singapore
5
Well spaced food stations serving up food for all covering Japanese, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Italian, Mediterranean foods; colourful restaurant, always busy, well-run. Try the Asian noodle bar and of course the Dessert Bar...great selection.Weekly theme nights including infamous "seafood night" with particular attention to Oysters from various locales, flown in fresh
5
The buffet was terrific and the food was brilliant. Worth every penny. My only possible complaint could be that it was so busy; but surely that is a good sign for the quality of the restaurant. The food is prepared before your very eyes and tastes as good as it looks
1
If you like Chinese food and variations thereon - this is fine. If you like huge crowds of people - this is fine. If you like cramped tables - this is fine. If you like large variation of food - this is not fine. The place has an undesreved reputation that I just cannot endorse. One meal there was enough at our recent stay at the parent hotel - we cancelled the second booking and ate elsewhere.Staff are fine and friendly but the choice of food and the throngs of people just put me off
5
I've been here a number of times and it never disappoints. The main attraction for me is the fresh sea food however the many cooking stations deliver tasty dishes from all over the world but a focus is on Asian Cuisine - everything from sushsi to curries to chinese dishes.The chocolate fountain is a big hit with those for a sweet tooth with fresh fruit to dip.A good wine list and not crazy expensive.I can't recommend this place enough
5
Loved it the food is great and fresh and they have special offers like bottomless beer and wine..great deal
5
All you can eat (buffet) very good quality price and delicious most of all
5
A must visit if you are a foodie. Great food, fresh, delicious. Eat as much as you like and as many variety as you can...
5
They have a great selection of western, Indian, Malay, Chinese, and Japanese food. Crisp, modern styling and Shangri-La service!
4
The Line is famous for its food selection. It is pricy though. And a little outta-the-way.....
5
Living in Singapore it's always good to find a buffet that caters to full international tastes. some Hotel buffets claim they serve an international spread, however, you can be in for a disappointment sometimes when you realise it's anything but. The Line pulls out all the stops, the variety of the food offered on the buffet is excellent and it is of a high standard. whether it's seafood, Roast loin of Beef there is something for everyone. The atmosphere is always busy and the setting is very pleasant. We've been here on 4 occasions already and have always been very satisfied. They were offering a Birthday promo last year whereby they would offer 50% for 2 dinners on your birthday. Essentially this enables one to dine free, a very good promotion. I'm wondering where to eat for this years birthday, but sadly this promotion seems to be no more. Nevertheless it wouldn't put me off going back again and again
5
My favorite buffet in the world! I have never seen such an amazing variety of food. It looked like every type of cuisine was present. I just love this restaurant and whenever I am at the Shangrila I go here because it is a fun place and also all the food is so delicious. I think my favorite is the Indian station.
5
We had dinner at The Line Bistro in the Shangri la Hotel Singapore. This place will just blow your mind, it has the most amazing fresh foods and sweets that you have ever seen. They also have unlimited drinks. You must eat there on a Thursday nights thats when we did and i wanted to go back every night after.

This is a restaurant in one of Singapore's best-loved, upscale hotels. But something has gone seriously wrong with its service. Visited it around midnight on a Friday and was shocked by the indifferent service. Very few tables were occupied, yet it was extremely difficult to get the staff's attention. After a first round of orders, we ordered a serving of fries. Twenty minutes later, it hadn't arrived. Called over a waiter, who went off to check, and never returned. Call over another, who returned to report that the chef had missed our order, but that it would arrive soon. A waiter finally delivered it without a word of apology, or a bon appetit, nothing. I still remember when this restaurant was the Shangri-La's coffee house 20 years ago, before it underwent a makeover to become The Line – it was not as trendy then, but the food was as good and the service flawless. The Shang needs to live up to its reputation
1
Very unaccommodating staff; asked to be seated outside and they told us they were fully booked for the evening despite no one being outside and very little people inside... did not offer any alternatives- the staff just giggled rudely and snubbed my husband and I. Not to worry, I will pass word to all my friends and colleagues to not eat here.
3
It's ok ... good selection, but the sashimi selection is dismal... and there are no outstanding dishes... it all ranges from poor to good, but nothing "very good".
5
because after you try it once, you want to go again! That said, the price is steep. It is a good option should you decide to splurge for special occasion. Great variety of food, the ones you like probably wont fail you.
4
Whilst I am not a buffet kinda guy, this is a great spread of food. So starve yourself and then overindulge!
4
Good spread and quality. Well worth the money spent.
5
A great favourite with my 12 year old son. Alwas a fantastic spread and good mix of excellent western and local dishes.
5
It may be a little pricey but d sashimis r very fresh n generous in d cut portion.Kids can really go ga ga over d served desserts.
3
I expected a more classy environment for Shangrila and for the price of this buffet, but the place is like a zoo. Do not go there for a date. It is over crowded and extremely noisy. As such service is too on par.
5
The place has tendecy to get filled up especially during breakfast. But the staff will always find a place for you. At the Line - you'll never "fall" in Line. You will always be seated. ha ha ha. The breakfast treat's choices are fine - average, but the Lunch is great
5
We have enjoyed a few lunches at The LIne restaurant, including Christmas Lunch which was the ultimate in Christmas meals. We have always found the food to be the best quality and the service staff to be prompt with meeting your needs. The dessert section is a special favourite with our family, particularly the chocolate fountain. The cost is quite expensive but the The LIne delivers value for money
4
This is the second time I've been to The Line on a Thursday evening, last time with colleagues around Christmas, this time with family.The variety of food was very wide, with even prata and satay covered hidden next to the usual Indian cuisine. There is very little that I can say against the place in this regard.The service was good in comparison to the last time, previously, we found the drink replenishment was a little slow, however, they had really improved this time and I was rarely waiting thirsty for a drink.The Aircon in the restaurant was a little cool for me, but, a visiting member of family from cooler climates was very comfortable, I suppose it depends on how long you've been in Singapore and what you wear to dinner.All in all the experience was delightful, I can see myself returning for a 3rd visit some time in the future
5
The choice at the buffet is so much that it may confuse you. The food is excellent. I saw people enjoying their meals and conversations same as i did. It was a very good experience.
3
When i go to that restaurant i would never ever eat that because ido not like the smell.
5
Amazing seafood buffet, nice variety. A bit pricey
4
U get a good mix from this buffet place however the price is not for "everyday" meal budget....
4
Excellent food selection ranging from fresh fruit juices to seafood, local dishes, Chinese and Japanese. Gorgeous desserts. My favourite is the iced seafood spread. Little noisy (older folks might find it hard to hear) but definitely buzzy at Sunday brunch.
4
Enjoyed the buffet spread, but for the price was expecting better in terms of spread per station (eg. wider variety of Indian / Japanese spead). Dessert/ cake selection could be better, IMO. They were not exactly one to die for!Overall, still a pretty good buffet place!Note: some of the areas are undergoing renovation (including around the pool area
5
During our stay in the Shangri-La we (2 adults - 2 kids [8 months and 2.3 years]) had daily breakfast here as well as two times dinner. The breakfast selection already is overwhelming but the dinner is unbeatable for a buffet. So difficult to pace yourself as there is too much choice. at the end you will not enough space left for the sweets.Try to sit outside to enjoy the bit of green
4
Great variety of cuisine including a satay bar, seafood, Japanese, western, Chinese, dim sum and a large dessert bar. Nice modern airy location with good service and we got complimentary beer too. Price was a little pricey ($55 per head after discount) but worth the experience to enjoy a more formal occasion. Go on their website to make your reservation, and there are usually a variety of discounts available that you can make your reservation under
4
Juz rated it good coz it sounds like a nice western restaurant for the westerners but too bad I am forbidden to consume a non-halal food which does not comply to the strict amendments n rites of my religion. One of it is to have the meat slaughtered by a Muslim reciting the holy prayers. Aawwww!!
1
We had not been back to "The Line'" for Breakfast for a long time as the last time we went they handed us the bill before we had our coffee (this was buffet breakfast). The procedure has obviously been changed since we ordered our coffee/tea and it took about 15mns to come, but there was relief as there was no sign of the bill yet. It is a huge restaurant very impersonal, and I wouldn't like to be a guest in Shangri-La and be treated like a nobody everyday at breakfast..........The food is decent but not up to the standard of such a hotel, the eggs are made on demand but by the time you get your eggs, yours beans and bacon are stone cold as they were not really hot in the dish anyway.......All in all glad to have been back since it means for us that we will not go back and be charged that much money for an average buffet breakfast with non-existent service as most serving staff are way too busy to notice there is a room full of paying customers......
4
Some very good local dishes such as chicken rice. The Sunday buffet is deservedly popular.
4
try so many different cuisines - best for breakfast
5
Best buffet in Singapore, could eat all day and not cover all choices available.
3
For a person who can really eat or pig out. The Line would be a great place but the buffet is not cheap
5
Best buffet we have been to. Just amazing. Almost anything you could wish for in a buffet. Staff were excellent, lighting was good (not sure what the other reviewer meant about that). Sure, it's expensive, but worth the experience.
5
We had a wonderful time at the Christmas day buffet at the line. The service was impeccable, our glasses were never empty. Our plates whipped away as soon as we had finished a course. The food was divine and what a selection. We went around the world in dining that day. The best ham I've ever had in my life. Seafood to die for. And the kids adored the desserts. A special Christmas we will never forget
3
The Line used to be a classy place for a good buffet dinner, if you do not mind paying a little more... however, after it re-do its deco, it seemed that you are paying high prices to eat at a food court. I used to call it a "high class food court"! For that kinda price, I'd rather eat at Fullerton Hotel or some other hotels...
1
I used to come here quite often for the weekend buffet brunch. It was a terrific place to bring visitors from out of town or to relax with the family. Plenty of choice, good food, nice setting, friendly service, wonderful desserts. But late last year they hiked their prices so much I can't bear to go back any more.It's now $98++ per head for brunch, which is just outrageous for a weekend buffet. And that's the cheap brunch, not the expensive one with champagne. And don't forget to add the 17% of GST+service charge. Any drink outside a very small list will be charged extra (lemonade for example). Bear in mind it used to be $50 on Saturadays! When I saw the bill of $250 for 2 people, I almost fell off my chair.I've seen other reviewers complain about this business model, so common in restaurants here: set up a great restaurant, build a reputation, then raise prices and cut costs massively so you can milk it dry. That's what's happened here and it's a sad thing to behold. I really wish I could go back here every other weekend but unfortunately I'll just have to be satisfied with happy memories
4
What can Shangri-la do wrong with food? Nothing!;)For about $100 a pax, you get all the food you want if you eat everything. There is food from all countries. There is a Japanese sushi station, Indian food, western, and local food. However, if you don't fancy seafood, no point paying to come here. Most items are sea related. Pehaps they can have two prices, one for seafood items and one without. As I do not fancy seafood that much, it was not worth coming. However, the food and service are simply great!Also, if you are planning to come here, please forget about breakfast or lunch. just have dinner here. There are just so much to eat. The issue is can you eat all the food...smileWe suggest, take a bite size to try. Do not overeat...smile Drop the carbo as you may get too full before you have started to savour all the delicious food here.Quality is what they have here.It is a good place for school reunion, friends gathering, family get together but not so good for business as they may get distracted. Also having to pick up your food while you are discussing business is not encouraged.;

Wide variety of good quality options. For example, if you want a proper British breakfast they do have good bacon and sausages, beans, and HP sauce- sometimes black pudding as well- with every passing year, there are fewer and fewer hotels around the world that are able to provide a solid breakfast.Plenty of other good options as well- Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese, continental.I recommend getting up for a 20km run at 0400 when the streets of Singapore are deserted and the air is as fresh as it gets, perhaps heading West to Clementi Road where the British defensive line was in 1942 when the Fall of Singapore took place, and then getting back in to the Shang for a shower as the tropical heat and humidity kicks in, before rewarding yourself with a proper cooked breakfast as you start your day in Singapore.If you live in Singapore then I recommend signing up for the hotel's Shang Rewards loyalty programme, this will give you a discounted rate- very competitive on weekdays- at all the dining outlets, as well as free parking.The buffet dinner is a favourite among local families, if you like buffets then this is a good option- on certain nights it includes a free-flow of beer and wine
4
+ very wide choice of quality food, + nice outside seating
- noisy tables inside, - if full, slow service
5
The breakfast at The Line must be one of the best in town, if not Asia (and I am a business traveler and have a few). Opulent is an understatement.
3
The buffet dinner is expensive.. food is ok, nothing outstanding..
lighting is very dim in the restaurant..
5
Every concievable type of food for all nationalities, cooked freshly Would be difficult to beat anywhere in the world.
5
The Line has several food counters of varying cuisines - chinese, italian, indian, etc. There is a wide variety of food choices so that even if we had breakfast everyday for four days, we did not tire of the food selection.
5
We just couldn't beleive our eyes when we saw the magnitude and variety of the lunch buffet. My 13 year-old thought he had died and gone to heaven!Best shrimp i have tasted outside SÃ¨te in France. The chocolate fountain was totally decadent. We loved it
5
This restaurant is located next the pool at the Shangri La Hotel off Orchard Road.We have been here for Lunch and also Breakfast.We would very highly rate both but the breakfast is exceptional.If you are looking for an exceptional lazy buffet breakfast you will not find any better
4
Had Sunday brunch (no champers!) and as always a vast array of food at I guess some 17 stations. Staff friendly and helpful. Didn't seem quite so good as my last visit about 4 years ago. Very popular with ex-pats meeting for Sunday lunch especially roast beef! The Line is a large eatery and very noisy but somehow seems to be lacking in atmosphere. Personally for the same price I prefered Melt
4
My family had a weekend lunch gathering at the line. Despite being Singaporean, it was my 1st time there. I felt the variety could be wider and the swordfish/tuna sashimi was short in supply. Overall, it was still a nice dining experience. Service was good and so was the decor and atmosphere
4
Been here a few times. One of the best buffet selection in Singapore i would say, they have some local delights like satay, laksa, noodle soup, kung pao chicken and other cuisine like sashimi, salad, seafood, beef... and lots of desserts! They used to have crayfish and lobster when i went few years back... but i did not see any during my last visit a few months back. Not sure if they took out from the menu or it's just the day that i went...Service was just average. We made reservation and had to wait awhile as the server was attending to some customers. Although we were the next in line, some customers just arrived and cut the queue and wanted to be seated immediately. The servers wanted to show them to the seats and we had to interrupt and remind the server that we came first (despite the fact that they already saw us) before they proceeded to show us to our seats... I do not expect this kind of service standard for the 5 star hotel and the price i'm paying for my food
4
Excellent spread of asian & western fayre. The place is lacking in character and feels a bit sterile. I prefer other brunches in Singapore but this is very good.
2
Too expensive for the limited variety (no oysters on weekdays)
4
Must book cause it's always booked up! The spread is just REALLY good!
4
There are wide range of international culinary provided even down to the local Singaporean food.... but served in 5 *hotel restaurant. The draw back would be... too many customer around. Service is good and classy :-)
5
lovely custom brunch restaurant with many live stations and good staff. good value
5
Modern furnishings and wide variety of breakfast items including Chinese, fruits, Indian and continental. More casual in its setup.
3
Many spread of food expected of a hotel buffet, all the usual suspects, over-priced n over-rated. Overall so-so. Hotel location is a bit inconvenient unless u drive or u are staying there.
4
I have been staying at Shangri La for over a week now. Visiting the Line every morning for a breakfast and went there few times for a dinner. Generally the place is fine, but make sure you don't mistake it for sort of fancy restaurant. It serves very well its purpose and it is one of the most efficient hotel restaurant I saw so far. My congratulations to the morning shift manager. However I do hope that it does not belong among top 20 restaurant here in Singapore
5
The Line at the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore is a very pleasant and enjoybale way to spend a few hours with delightful food. From the freshly shucked oysters from Canada to the Peking Duck and selection of other dishes it was a amost enjoyabel evening.The decor is casual but chic and the staff are quiet attentive - what else would you expect from a hotel of this qulity.My wife and I tried a lareg aeeay fo the food but we could not try it all - there were just so many stations.SO overall very enjoyable food with good attentive staff and a fair price
5
Excellent well presented, The Line buffet is one of the best, a little thing, water is free that's why everybody drinks cold fresh water, I did not know I ordered 4 glasses of juice and a repeat this will cost you for 4 people around the USD 100.00 so watch it, sushi is lovely prepared in front of you, oysters are fresh and plentiful desserts are lovely. Nothing to complain about, if you choose to eat outside around the pool a mist of water is constantly sprays overhead to keep temperatures down, eye to detail is the thing over here
4
excellent variety but they pack the diners tight, especially on public holidays when they can make a lot of money. Diners are left having to put up with annoying patrons, likely drunk, just a few feet away.
5
Love the spread, esp the sashimi and the oyster... the roast is good too. Go for the dessert. skip the "filler" (those that fill your stomach but common stuff you can eat anywhere else) such as pows and pasta. Indian section is good as well.
4
The line had every kind of breakfast food available the service was amazing the hotel was very full but there was no wait for a table and as soon as the coffee cup went empty it was magicaly refilled.
5
It is so cool. every type of food imaginable, desserts and all. It is just about the best hotel food I have tried.
5
The breakfast is simply brilliant - a flavour for everybody
5
There is nowhere like it, we think the quality and variety of foods are amazing and we have no hesitation in recommending it, treat yourself!
5
If only I had the 4 digestive sections (or preferably stomachs) of a cow, which is what one needs here. At The Line one can have all the exoticism of eating different street food under the protective umbrella of the Shangri-La Hotel.I was revolted to see the neighbours at the next door table loading up their plates four or more times, but it did not take long to realise why. Nothing, but nothing is other than mouth wateringly delicious. Common decency and decorum disappear at the sight of delicious curries, wondrous soups, honey glazed duck and pork, freshest sushi and mountains of prawns and oysters. Self discipline is not enough to bypass the pecan tart, honey tartlets,pistachio wonders and all the other delizia that comes straight from the kitchens of Heaven.If one is going to commit a venal sin, let it be gluttony and let it be at The Line
5
We were greeted very warmly and shown to our table and then we just hit the huge seafood buffet. Staff at all food counters were all happy smily helpful people. The buffet is almost beyond description. Everything you'd wish for was there. We visited The Line on Thanksgiving, and even if they had the big seafood buffet out, they had also roast turkey complete with cranberry sauce, sautÃ©ed brussel sprouts, fried potatoes and gravy. Oh, and stuffing. Most importantly. Snowcrab, oysters, crayfish, sushi. And non-seafood, there was an Indian buffet, a Chinese buffet, and last but definitely NOT least, a fantastic spread of desserts, complete with made-as-you-watch crepes with banana and ice-cream. We munched and munched until we could fit no more and I don't think I was ever this full. The decor is a bit on the downside, all plasticky tables and chairs, not adding a lot of exquisite ambiance to match the elegance of the food. But that's all I can complain about and it almost doesn't count
5
Many say that the quality dropped while I disagree. I see the huge line of buffet and free flow of alcohol included in the rate. I was there for crabby Tuesday, there were king crabs, crab curry, crab risotto, crab fried rice, chilli crab, soft shell crab tempura. Notwithstanding, there were of course the meat options, which covers almost everything. Well, I am not a big fan of desserts but they did have fondue, cakes and ice cream but not the longest dessert spread I have seen.
5
in the basement of Shangri La Hotel is the best buffet dinner place in Singapore. The Service is perfect, very nice design of that place and the food is wonderful. all kinds of food (Oysters, Sushi, Italian, Indian, Chinese, French and best Dessert section ever) in an outstanding quality. for me it's a must to have dinner there when I am in Singapore. It is not the cheapest place but for that quality in food and service it is O
5
The best breakfast I had since Atlantis in Dubai!
Huge choice of Western and Asian food. Friendly staff as always at Shangri-La
5
Wow a wonderful breakfast, I loved it , excellent quality, like the Hilton in Melbourne, wonderful, the staff are to commended too, beautiful people giving of themselves, with their smile and joke!
1
I have been there twice - once for the buffet and once for ala carte. The food is way overpriced and the quality is average at best. I can't figure out why there is so much hype about this place...
5
Very few places in the world can you get a good quality yorkshire pudding with your sushi! Excellent range of cuisines being cooked, and very good value for money.
4
we went for lunch buffet at the line yesterday. i know it wasn't as nice after reading the reviews at www.hungrygowhere.com (i would have sent the review there but i don't need another username and password to remember).we got there before 12 as we needed to redeem the golden circle pts. they were great, we didn't have to wait for the redemption voucher, they delivered it to the line.the first surprise: they didn't ask if we have reservation, they wanted to find seat for us straight away. wow! this was the place that's always full and impossible to get a seat inside w/o reservation. ummm.....times have changed. anyway, we had reservations and told them and they seated us. second surprise: no more oysters. a bit disappointed but we were there for crabs. they are just right for our "i don't want chilli" kid. food wise, its ok. i still love their ice-creams and sorbets (mango sorbet is great halfway through the heavy meal). the ppl at he ice-cream counter were very nice too. and desserts are still decent. we didn't take cut fruits since there were a couple of fruit flies. sashimi is still good. didn't try the rest of the japanese stuff. roast duck wasn't as nice as it used to be. i skipped other chinese and all of indian food. lobster bisque was ok, need a bit more salt.the great thing about the line always is service. Dinash and Eleanor are very nice. Dinash was very natural but Eleanor was nice too after she warms up. and i like the line as it is now, its very cosy, quiet and great place to spend an afternoon with the family. we were so full after lunch that we didn't eat anything until about 10pm and i had milo and a few biscuits before i went to bed. :-
5
The Line is based in the Shangri-La Hotel and has the most amazing buffet we have ever been to! Our kids (aged between 8 and 15) love buffet, and to get buffet with so much choice as the Line was brilliant! not only was there amazing choice...eg an Italian area, Chinese, Malayan, Indian, Seafood, Noodle Bar, vegetarian and salad and Desserts bar...wow!!....but the quality was generally great...far better than you would usually expect at a buffet.We were staying at the Shangri-La so went to The Line a couple of times and it didn't disappoint...there is so much choice you could go every night for a week and have different, good quality meals. One night they had a beer special...pay for one Tiger beer and get re-fills all night!!It isn't cheap, but that doesn't worry you too much when you have a satisfying and high quality meal. Seems the locals agree, as there were plenty there each night...always a good sign! Make sure you book ahead
5
It's worth it! The many cuisines represented in the buffet are exciting and flavorful. Unless you have a bottomless stomach, yo will not be able to enjoy everything. The impressive buffet is divided among many stations spread across the entire restaurant. You can choose from many types of food found throughout that region and you will not have made a bade choice.I was there for a family celebration with old folks and kids and everyone was happy with their meal. The service was very attentive, especially for a buffet.Try the durian cake if you dare
4
My wife and I ate here in the evening on two occasions during our Singapore stay and it was always busy but a fascinating place to eat.The excellent layout of the serving stations allows for a constant flow of fresh food to be presented and the array is outstanding from the busy seafood/sushi station to the dessert/lolly station. Apart from observing the never ending flow of clientele it was interesting to also watch the highly efficent interaction of the inhouse management team as they monitored all parts of restaurant's operations
3
Went our first night in town. A nice intro to Singapore's many cuisines. Best bets are to go to stations where the chefs are actually preparing the food, as opposed to those dishes in the warmers. All of the food was tasty, but not of the highest quality. Should have been, based on what we paid. I know Singapore is expensive, but there are better places to go for the money
3
We had there a dinner buffet and we feel the place is not so comfortable. Even though the food quality was good there is too many people and compared with other Hotel buffets, you do not feel comfortable most of the time.You may need to queue for some food or keep going back to the satay station to get some as they keep preparing more, but with so many people it was gone most of the times.Some desserts will not be offered anymore after they are over like Tiramisu.As I said there is too much people all around and even some times they keep bumping into you.Maybe for some people this could be a good buffet experience, but for us at SGD 88++ per person you may get much better and "comfortable places" to enjoy a buffet
4
I guess everyone can find the food for them at The Line. So many choices and taste good.
5
There are several stations offering Chinese, Malaysian, Singaporean, Japanese and Western fare. Try to laska, it was incredible. Breakfast has great assortment of fresh fruit. A bit pricey but worth at least on try.
5
Even if you are not staying at the Shangri-La hotel, a visit the The Line restaurant for breakfast is a must.
We stay here on a regular basis and the breakfast is probably the best I have ever had from any other international hotel.
5
Choose the buffet and be hungry for it. Wonderful choice . All types of food at different counters, freshly cooked for you. Casual dining. All day dining---24 hrs---no dress code. Price reasonable. Also a la carte available.
4
Visited the line today with my family for the buffet dinner. The variety of the buffet is good which consist of Indian, Mediterranean, Chinese, Japanese, Singaporean and western dishes. Not forgetting the desserts, though i think that the Melts' Cafe's desserts has a better spread and quality compared to the Line. Check out the Yam ice-cream, pretty nice.Tried a bit of everything and the cod fish is memorable. It has the strong fish oil taste which i liked, and i understand that some diners may not like. The laksa is pretty good. However, the prawn noodle is aweful, blend and just like drinking a bowl of coloured plain water. The Oysters are big and fresh though, as well as the poached prawns. The sushi is fresh and juicy too. The service wise is pretty standard and SOP, no personal touch and i can sense that the waiters were just there to clear the empty plates on our tables. Average in terms of food quality. The place was so full that you keep knocking onto somebody when i was moving around the buffet table. However, in view that i enjoyed the 40%, I really think that's a meal of great value

This restaurant tends to receive favourable reviews. Our experiences were generally negative. We ate there 5 times (we were guests in the hotel, and the hotel is some distance from other eating options). On those five occasions, our seating was as follows - once in the bakery sale area (seriously), once in the rain (yes, it's true), once butting up against a cash register (always a lovely touch), once behind a pillar, and once on a nice table. The a la carte service is shockingly bad - largely due to poorly trained service staff (they were trying their best, but these poor chaps have been brought in from other countries, and clearly Shangri-la has decided that as it is primarily a buffet restaurant, it is not necessary to give these waiters proper training). The staff are under so much pressure that they cannot give any real attention to any clients. Their only interest appears to be in capturing your room number for booking purposes.We saw a manager physically disciplining a staff member, which shocked us.There is certainly a great deal of food available, so if you're a person who is impressed by large quantities of food, you may like this retaurant. We found the experiences impersonal and unpleasant. This is quite contrary to our general eating experiences in Singapore
5
"The Line" is a line of food for all tastes. I have never been very fond of oysters, but here they were fresh and tasty. Loved the sushi too, the range of deserts is unbelivebel.It's a busy place, so if you like that this is the place for all type of people
5
I have to say that they put on the best buffet breakfast that I have seen so far. They have an amazing array of food to serve the needs of people from all over the world, whether you want a Full English, some Dim Sum, omelette, pastries & cakes, noodle soup.... they have it all. It is a bit of a splurge financially but as a little treat then it is great
4
We had brunch at The Line last week and have to say it is the best we have experienced. We were 3 women having a relaxing holiday and they kindly seated us away from noisy children in a quiet corner. We couldn't fault the service and our only complaint was that they kept giving us clean plates, knives and forks to keep encouraging us to eat more!! The food was well presented and of a great standard. The buffet was beautifully presented and there was everything and more than you could want
4
This is a buffet restaurant (not sure if you can also order of a menu).The number of buffets and the types is really wide. I remember the following:- Indian- Salad- Seafood- Chinese- DesertAnd there were probably a few more.We had a team dinner function, for which this is the perfect venue
5
Superb Variety and Fresh food.
Unlimited champagne on weekends.
5
Amazing spread for the buffet! Great for groups with diverse people...they have all the choices - India, Western, Japanese, Singaporean, etc etc
5
Oyster Tuesdays recommended!
5
The most unbelievable buffet with an incredible variety of cuisine choices. The chinese noodle bar, peking duck, Indian dishes, malaysian dishes, Chinese, Dim Sum, Sushi bar, Seafood bar, Crepe bar...just awesome for any foodie. Costly, but worth it for the experience if you love food.
2
Disappointing selection, pasta undercooked, overpriced; bad service for the kind of money people are paying
4
I rank the breakfast buffet in the Line at the Shangri-La the best in the world. So much choice - French pastries, chinese, japanese, indian, western grill, wonderful fruit ....It is a great way to start the day.I have also eaten lunch and dinner. I find the value not as good at those times.It is expensive if all you want is to pick an item or two.The wine list is also very expensive
2
This restaurant has a good reputation for the size quality and quantity of its buffet. This is mainly true and I have generally found the food excellent. BUT they miss a trick when it comes to drinks which are ridiculously expensive. $11 for a can of sprite? $31 for a glass of champagne? Stupid. After a good meal the drinks bill leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Despite the food its not worth the money. Just drink water - maybe they will get the message
2
Went to The Line for a Saturday lunch buffet. Buffet food SGD$50++ per head. Drinks expensive at SGD$15-20 for a juice/healthy choice. On the positive side, the fresh shucked oysters (for each diner) were excellent - fresh from Canada. Prawns were average quality. Japanese section had a good selection of fresh Sashimi (Tuna, Salmon, Snapper, Squid). Other seafood disappointing though.On the negatives, very strong Asian food style focus. But rather than stick to what they know, the restaurant missed simple pairings. For example, Roast Turkey was on offer (post new year visit) but no roast vegetables to compliment. Also the server had no idea on how to carve roast meat. Roast beef was also way undercooked (not even rare) to be on display and served (blood should not run out across the cutting board). The selection of desserts was also disappointing.The ambiance itself is nice and the wait staff were very prompt with service.On balance I was really disappointed with the food and probably won't return for a long time. Very disappointing for a Shangri-La
4
I don't like buffets as I find it a vulgar and overeating is never good. Having said that, I've been to the Line 3-4 times for business reasons in the last 5 years. It's certainly the best buffet in town, though I'm skeptical why it is the No 2 restaurant in Singapore. It's a buffet for goodness sake, not fine dining. Michelin will flip when they see this. The lunch deal is much better than dinner. For dinner, they change 2-3 dishes and charge doubl
4
We never took the opportunity to eat here for dinner, but ate here several times for breakfast brunch since we stayed at the Shangri-La hotel. My wife and I highly recommend checking this place out. They have a large variety of food to choose from which also applys to lunch and dinner. Whether you are in the mood for American, Chinese, Korean, Indian, French, or what have you... they have it fixed and ready for you to eat. We enjoyed all the fresh fruits, fruit drink smoothies, waffles, freshly made egg omelettes, salad, and various other things to choose from.This place is a bit busy and trendy, but that isn't a bad thing necessarily. It just can get a little crowded and loud at times if you aren't in the mood for that.I will also warn you as others have that this is no cheap place to eat. You could easily top $100SGD for two people which is a bit pricy. So other than the price, this place has a lot of great options and choices for your dining pleasure
5
Absolutely fantastic
3
Quality and selection lives up to the Shangri La brand, but The Line is simply overpriced (for weekends)
5
The only place I'd go for buffet! Awesome!
3
Wide choice but gets boring after a few visits.
5
LOVE THIS PLACE! GREAT SPREAD, SCRUMPTIOUS FOOD!
5
The Dinner Buffet - * die die must try *
Wide Variety of food.. Fresh seafood & heavenly desserts!~~ :-)
3
great line up, I love it
5
I have visited The Line twice. Recently i revisited and still find the place almost full (and the place is huge!). The food remains top notch in terms of selection. You can pick from fresh oysters, sushi, chinese dim sum, roti prata, cooked western and chinese food, thai selection, pastas and many delicious dessert. Basically if you come with empty stomach, you will guaranteed be full
4
I recently went to The Line during a visit to Singapore. The selection is very impressive (it was Oyster night) and although expensive the deal that includes the 'free flow' of wine or beer. wasn't unreasonable.On arriving without a booking I was told that only outside tables were available. These tables were less pleasant than being inside, plus added to the walk to revisit the buffet. There were many free tables inside, but I was told that these were for people with reservations or if hotel guests wanted them. On my return to my hotel I asked the Concierge desk to make a booking for another mid week night. The response from The Line was that 'only outside tables were available' for that night.A pleasant experience and one of the best buffets I have ever visited, but I'd book early and push for an inside table if you're not staying at the Shangri-L
5
I'm Singaporean & love food. I go to THE LINE about 4-8 times a year. Would go there more often except that it's one of the most expensive buffet restaurants in Singapore. The cost of an adult dinner is approx S$68-$88 depending on the day you go. If i recall correctly, Tuesdays are oyster nights which means there are a variety of oysters that evening. So it's more expensive on Tuesdays. Do call [---] to check.My review will be for dinners: You have a choice of 16 culinary stations. At most stations, the chefs entertain your special requests. Eg, the Italian station: you have a choice of different pastas (linguine/fettucine in different flavours such as sun dried or squid ink or spinach). You can tell the chef your sauce preference (tomato/bolognaise/cream/pesto) and add ingredients such as bacon, ham, garlic, mushrooms etc. Pre-cooked and replenished on the Italian counter - there may be pizzas, lasagnes and other hot food.The Japanese station offers a choice of sashimi (raw sliced fish) and it's usually salmon, tuna, octopus and sometimes swordfish and yellowtail. There's also handrolls, sushi, california maki etc. The chef slices the sashimi only when you place your order with him/her so it's fresh.At the cold seafood station, seafood such as oysters, crab pincers, scallops on the half shell, sometimes even crayfish (cheaper version of lobster) are usually the mainstays. Salad station alone has a good variety where you can either help yourself to the veggies or they can prepare for you caesar salad (yes, with smoked salmon, anchovies, parmesan cheese ...) or at times, Singapore salad commonly known as Rojak is also available. You can also mix and match the dressings.There is a grill station where sometimes the roast is lamb or beef and it's usually medium doneness. You can then request for your sliced meat to be more cooked or even well-done. It's good that you can also have a nice choice of sauces to go with your meat and even mustards and mint jelly. But the yorkshire pudding that's available for the beef isn't good. It's pre-baked so it kinda steers to the tough, unchewable texture. Also at this area, you can help yourself to western style cooked items such as fish, vegetables and western creamy soup. The buns for the soup are also cold and sometimes not so soft. There is a Chinese wok station where there is a turntable of dim sum (dian xin) such as 'har gao' or shrimp dumplings, 'siew mai' or pork dumplings and 'pao' or chinese steamed buns and other unusual finger foods. Nearby, the wok station will be stir-fry items and can be anything goes... I've tried crabs, oyster omelette, veggies but somehow, I'm not a fan of this station except for the 'har gao'.There is the Malay and Indian station where you can have tandoori, satay (sticks of grilled skewered meat such as pork, chicken, beef) and even roti prata. I've tried naan (Indian flatbread) from this station and dipping it in bolognaise sauce. That's the great thing about buffet -- mixing and matching!My family loves the roast duck at the station where wanton noodles are available. Again, a variety of noodles. You can have noodles lightly tossed in oil or do the healthy thing and opt for soupy version. There's roast pork and other meat items but do try the roast duck. I don't like duck but the roast duck here is generally pretty good.Now, onto the favourites of the buffet.The ice cream station: think America's Cold Stone Creamery. Yes, ice cream mixed on a cold slate with oreo cookies, nuts and other candies. There's ice cream and there's also sherbet. Kids also line up here for candies. And there's that chocolate fountain where skewered marshmallows, cookies and strawberries are there for you to dip in liquid choc.I love the western dessert station. Think desserts in a shot glass. Yup, that's the standard. Do try the tiramisu in a glass. A variety of choices include cakes, macarons, pannacotta, mini creme brulee... Dessert choices change approx every 3-4 days so you don't get bored.The asian dessert station has local desserts but unfortunately, not as good a variety. Think Malay kuehs etc. Nearby, you can get crepes made to order and i like getting mine plain and going to the cold seafood station for a wedge of lemon and then sprinkling sugar over my crepe. Waffles with mashed bananas and some fruits are also available.Drinks are not included in the buffet price except for tea and coffee. I think a glass of local beer is approx S$10-12 but i'm not sure.Sunday lunch price includes some mix fruit juices.Breakfast will be eggs made to order. Muffins, breads, doughnuts are all available.Most importantly, do make reservations preferable 3 days in advance cos the restaurant is usually packed. I've even celebrated V-Day there but honestly, it's SO not the most romantic place to have a date cos they play awfully loud music. Music which is not understandable! My aunt had a headache once after going. She wrote in to complain after that!Despite the noisy and super bright ambience, the staff gives good service. When they get busy on weekends, they do tend to forget to fill up your water but when we remind them, it's service with a smile.There's also an al fresco dining area but Singapore weather can get humid. Plus the risk of mosquitoes. I think you can't smoke here cos of the new government law banning smoking in buildings.If you have a group and want to make everyone happy with a variety of choices OR if it's your 1st time in Singapore and want to try most local flavours in air-conditioned comfort, go to The Line. But if you're looking for really really good authentic cuisine, try elsewhere. I usually come here more for relaxation and catching up with friends/family.Cheers!P/S do vote if you think I've been helpful;

best formula wide choice worth with veuve cliquot champagne

Spoilt for choice but expensive

The ambience is nice but food is just average.
4
Love it! Great choices, good food.
3
Lotsa Variety to choose from. but food is not fantastic.
5
Best buffet ever!! Steep price but worth every cent!!
4
One of the best varieties of buffet spread.
3
Average on most days but the seafood buffet is good.
3
Excellent buffet spread but excessively overpriced at SGD88.00++. Erratic service which I will not overlook although it was fully booked. Kindly hire more waitstaff. You can certainly afford to if you're charging SGD102.96 per person. Overall I am... unimpressed and feel I did not get what I paid for. The Bar & Billiard Room at Raffles Hotel far surpasses The Line in food quality and service level, yet it is cheaper. Go figure. Three stars coz of the seafood, otherwise deserving of two stars
5
Few years ago when I heard there's a great new buffet in town I was really tempted but the price made me think twice until I finally decided to check it out few months after the opening. You can say it became my staple restaurant for buffet dinner.The selection will overwhelm you. I normally just eat these: oysters, proscuitto parma, Kajiki sashimi, starter shooters, some desserts and maybe lobster, salmon and maguro sashimi, prawns, crabs, thai or chef salad, grilled beef or fish, ice-cream etc. My 3 year old (she's a regular since 1 so she knows what food to go for) will have pizza or hand made pasta or rice porridge with roast duck, plenty of strawberries with or without chocolate, maybe ice-cream if mummy allows, and gummy bears, marshmallows and M&Ms if her cousins are there as well.There are plenty out of each 'station' that I did not list. Of course if you don't like these, there are plenty of Chinese and Indian selections.You can't beat the quantity here. The quality is above average though sometimes it can be a little inconsistent (still a good bet compared to most other 5 star hotels) but I must say their dessert is just a little bit disappointing in quality compared to a few top notch hotels.Overall it's the place I will go to for a lunch or dinner buffet. Anyplace else is almost totally not worth the bother. Forget about Raffles' Bar & Billiard though I used to celebrate Christmas there annually (but they have excellent hand made chocolates and a particular duck dish), or Ritz, or Fullerton (regretted going - see my review on Fullerton's Town Restaurant). Is there any better? Yes, but not a normal lunch or dinner - go for the Sunday Brunch in Four Seasons. My maternal family become converts to The Line when I invited them to dinner and did frequent visits until I brought them to Four Seasons for Brunch. They were still dreaming of it few weeks after, like me when I first visited except that I can't resist and did my second trip within a month (very sinful if you think of all the foie gras, martini and mojitos)

Dun like the spread. prefer the old one.
2
Not my kind of style...
1
Over the top, too expensive and getting old
4
Really about the best local spread . Good value when you are eating on a credit card promotion.
3
The first time is good. After that it gets a bit boring.
3
Should at least try once.
5
Love the wide selection of the buffer spread. Good quality food. I heard the oysters night is very popular.
5
nice place ambience
4
Was there for a birthday celebration with my wife on a weekday. Each pax about S$49+++ if i'm not wrong. The buffet spread is international, ranging from Chinese to Japanese to Indian to Western... just about everything. But today, I attacked the Jap station the most... can't remember how many plates of sashimi already...definite recommendation if you have a craving for all the good food of singapore with excellent service... no wonder so many people come here for lunch even on a weekday afternoon...Worth it

The Line in Shangri-La is Singapore's premier destination for buffet buffs. The selection here is unrivaled and one questions whether its necessary to have so much food in one place! However, quality over quantity as one says. And I can tell you that the quality here has not been compromised. Every dish is cooked well if not superbly. Whenever I go for buffets, I tend to always load up on a lot of seafood. And the seafood here doesn't disappoint. It is definitely fresh an of a high standard. The second most important thing for me when it comes to buffets is the dessert though. And at The Line, desserts really do shine. Obviously, theres a huge chocolate fountain, and lots of other cakes of pastries. Service here is good and so is the food. Do come if you've just made it out of the jungle and have been starving for days. You might get giddy from all the flashing lights and screens though
4
Wide variety for a buffet restaurant.
Love the seafood on ice, the wide range of desserts and freshly cooked pasta.
4
Pretty nice big oysters, if you like. Wide variety of others. Discount with selected credits cards.
4
One of the best buffet with wide spread of food but is on the expensive side. I love the oysters which is so fresh and juicy.
4
Yummy
4
Your heart may skipped a beat at the price but it is really worth your every penny
5
The best buffet restaurant in Singapore with a terrific selection. A bit crowded.
5
The best!!! and i mean the best in my entire life of dining and eating out. It's worth every dollar and cent that you pay!!! Make sure you go with an empty stomach and leave room for the sumptuous range of desserts!!!
4
One of the best buffet spreads I've tasted- truly worth the money !
3
wide variety .. nice presentation ..taste wise ..average
5
High price but definitely worth it. Best buffet in Singapore!
5
The buffet here is excellent. The oysters were so good, that I went for a few more rounds. The dessert didn't satisfy me though, cos I'm not really a dessert guy. Chocolate fondue was ok. But I love the main spread. Excellent food.
5
it would be great if there is free flow and variety of drink to choose from like SAKURA BUFFET. Overall the food are great! rating will be 4.5/5
3
Good for lunches with extended family...otherwise, i'm not exactly a buffet person.
4

Great place for a family brunch. We go here a lot.
5
the best buffet spread ever...

The lunch buffet i had was sugoii~
5
I love the dessert spread... only downside is the price!!!
4
There's the hot stove and the baked pastries, cereals, muesli, yoghurts, fruits, the line never ends! Love it.
5
I have been here for breakfast and dinner and, I would rate both as the best buffet I've ever been to. The food quality is top notch and the selection is excellent. About the only negative was that the restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday night, which is not really their fault
4
The buffet spread here is quite nice, you can't really sample everything, there's really quite alot. But I like the salad bar, the japanese counter, the ala minute pasta counter, the seafood, and the desserts.
4
Great Selection. Value for Money for the high quality of food
5

4
Good buffet selection
2
white and modern. too much raw seafood but good that the desserts are aplenty and flavoursome
5
If you have spare cash, big appetite & a hard to please tastebud, this is the place you should go for. Go for the buffet, no one word can describe it, just look at my ratings. I think the selection of seafood, dessert & alcoholic beverages should not be miss. If you can, try everything over there, though I doubt it is highly possible. Highly recommended, other than the price tag which might give you a terrible headache
4
The spread is awesome!!
2
Like a high-class food court setting... Not really worth the $$...
5
If you love food, you have to treat yourself to a buffet here at least once. The star items are the naan (oh so soft) and the huge lobsters.

Love the buffet spread here

best buffet in town
1
The food is normal, nothing extraordinary. The atmosphere is spoilt by rather bad service and the place packed with people, made it seems like a coffee shop then a elegant high class buffet line. rather disappointing, there was an outdoor seating, not too sure if it is for the buffet but it has a far better atmosphere then the tables inside. End of the day is it a over-priced coffee shop
4
Great variety.

Expensive! And in an inaccessible location too. But there's an unbeatable variety of food. Seafood is very good and very fresh. Sometimes there's foie gras which is great too. Desserts are OK.
