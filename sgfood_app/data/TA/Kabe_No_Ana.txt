The restaurant was packed there was still a few tables being emptied. Go through the menu and ordered: 1) 2 coffees.2) hot plate salmon lemon herb butter spaghetti3) combo set - salad, soup, spaghetti & min chicken pizzaThe service was not bad not the dishes were below average

Ordered a combo set spinach pizza and mushroom, bacon pasta for dinner. The pizza seems like microwaved and served not from oven. Pasta is bland considering I've ordered mushroom and bacon which should be able to add a lot of favour to the dish. Very unfortunately it tasted really bland

We went on a Saturday for lunch as it is one of the dining places with no queue. It's not a big place but there were insufficient staff. Service was still ok despite insufficient service staff. We ordered a seasonal item, which was prawn bisque (S$15.90++), quite tasty. My hubby ordered a carbonara spaghetti (S$13.90++) set meal (top up S$4++ for a soup and coffee). The mushroom soup was tasty but the carbonara was average as per his standard. I ordered a fondant red velvet lava cake (comes with vanilla ice cream at S$9.90++) and my children finished it within 5 minutes. The dessert was expensive but yummy. Children's bowls and cutleries were provided. There was children's menu too but we didn't ordered as my kids were full

Tired of the usual ramen, donburi and curry rice, i simply decided one night to try a lesser known cuisine - wafuu spaghetti.Kabe no Ana is known for its wafuu or Japanese-style spaghetti and pasta. I was interested to know the Japanese version of an Italian dish. But after some thought, I decided I'm not into spaghetti that night. I took 2 items from the menu: salad and baked rice. The smoked salmon salad had a zesty taste which complemented the salmon, egg, assorted veggies and cheese dressing. I would have wanted bigger veggie cuts, though, and not tiny inch-long pieces. Tsukune and onsen tamago baked rice was satisfying. It is garlicky rice with chicken meatballs, capsicum, poached egg in meat sauce. Good mixture of different flavors. Loved the mozzarella cheese !Hot tea was a good wash down for this simple meal. Good stuff from Kabe no Ana.

Not much lunch crowd at 6pm and it was my first time to Nex shopping mall. Was captured by the nice food display and decided to give a try as we do not see this outlet in town.Later we realised that this restaurant uses 100% olive oil! Love it!I ordered YM03, Karatsuki Asari Tomato with Chili and it was awesome! Pasta was cooked at the rightly for me. It was satisfactory meal for us . The staff were very polite n helpful. Thank you for the great service and meal

Visted the branch in Jurong looking for good japanese pasta and we were greatly disappointed. Pizza was soggy and just drenched in mayo, my cream pasta was much too heavy and tasted of nothing other then the cream. Another person ordered a soy sauce based pasta, the noodles were completely dry and tasted of nothing other than garlic

I came here at least 5 times at NEX branch. Last Friday decide to come back for their unique flavour pasta, cod spicy with bacon pasta. It is not spicy at all. They have many choice of pasta and there are sample mold of the pasta at their entrance. They also showcase the top 3 best selling pasta. I always go for the first one as I dont get to taste that pasta elsewhere. What I like about this pasta is the sauce. The sauce is soyabean fermented sauce and with an egg on top on the pasta.To my surprise, at 7pm, there is a long queue and decide to wait for 15minutes since i am here. Upon receiving the dish, the meal is well presented. But the egg is already hard and therefore I call upon their restaurant manager if the egg is overcooked. Upon that, he said he will get me a bowl of soft boiled egg. I'm pleased with it though i expect a change of new pasta. Just disappointed that it seem not consistent when there are alot of people.Overall, still a very good meal and it costs about 16dollar plus after gst. They also provide free ice water which was not charged. Overall a good meal just hope in future they are consistent in their food preparation

We went to the outlet in NEX, Serangoon. When we arrived there, there were people in the queue but we didn't have to wait for too long before we got a seat in the restaurant.We were delighted that the restaurant serves cheese fondue, naturally we ordered that as part of our dinner. The fondue is to our liking.We ordered also the Wafu Teriyaki Salmon Mushroom and Umi No Sachi pasta
