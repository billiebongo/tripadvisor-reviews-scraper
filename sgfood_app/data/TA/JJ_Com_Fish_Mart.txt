I came here yesterday and today because I like the garlic fried rice here. It's tasty! The gindara teriyaki is nice too. Some food here may taste slightly different from normal japanese food. Overall is good!

This place across from Swissotel Merchant Court hotel offers great sushi at affordable prices. We visited there several times during our recent trip to Singapore. Very friendly and attentive service.

I am a regular here - they have S$9 (nett) pints of Asahi Super dry, as well as a whole range of bentos, dons, sashimi, sake and other drinks. A huge variety with a no-frills environment.The food is priced decently given its location - it's just tucked away in an inconspicuous corner, so be ready to be surprised

Considering JJ Fish mart is located in one of the many trendier malls, surrounded by chic shops, it is very down to earth, chilled and good value (well as much as sushi ever is).The range of the menu is immense with both fish and meat options. The various rolls were flavoursome but it was a surprise that the normal sushi is actually flame grilled with a sauce on. While this was nice I think next time we will ask for it to be raw, just personal preference.Very easy to get to, near Clarke Quay MRT, also nice to wander along the quay afterwards

I went here for a quick bite, and the place was fine. The price is really low if you compare it with other restaurant in the area.The waiters were polite and respectful. Anyway, in the overall, my experience was positive.I suggest it if you are looking for cheap food

Ordered the dry salmon ramen and enjoyed it very much! Love the freshness of the thick salmon and the ramen texture with the home-made sesame soy sauce. Quite a decent portion for one pax. Friend ordered their signature mentaiko shrimp maki and enjoyed it too, though the portion look smaller. Overall it's a quiet hidden spot and would like to come and try other dishes next time

Went to JJ based on a friend's recommendation. Place is relatively small and tucked a a corner, near the escalator of the building. It's not easy to find as I did not noticed any signboard as well. There's a good variety of food and one of my friend who is a vegan didn't have any problems getting a bowl of ramen with toufu and seaweed. The rest of us tried the various teriyaki don, sushi and tempura. Food is generally good for the price you pay. Portions for the don may be a bit small but it was ok for us as we also ordered some sushi and tempura to share. All in, we paid about $24 per person for a party of 6. The staff were nice and friendly but they can get a bit confused as they served us the orders by other customers twice. Food preparation and serving is also fast. Would recommend that you try this place if you are in the vicinity.

My bestfriend and I were craving for Japanese food and decided to head down here. The staff who welcomed us was very friendly and suggested their popular dishes. The Oysters with Ponzu dressing is a must try for those who just love oysters and the salmon roll is to die for. Yummy! The place is relaxing and good place to have dinner and catch up session with friends and family. The price is also very reasonable. Definitely will come back here again! :

Used to visit this restaurant when they were at Vivocity. First time here by accident. Booked dinner at Mitsuba in the same building but restaurant staff made a mistake on our reservation and Mitsuba"s staff's was really so rude that we walked out and decided to eat at JJ.com.Staff here is friendly. Setting is still quite similar to the old restaurant but has more dishes now. Good for a causal dinner. Food is pretty good at a reasonable price

Visited this joint for lunch and ordered a chirashi don. It's reasonably priced, due to its speedy preparation and freshness. The staff were also very friendly - always smiling.

third time I have eaten at JJ.Com Fish Mart fresh and Yummy The staff were friendly and quick I was given a free sherry glass !

Nice food in a simplistic yet nice set up with Japanese posters on the wall making it feels ''Japanese''. Friendly staff, too.

Around a year ago we were planning to eat at another Japanese restaurant in the Central which was top rated, but it was fully booked. What luck that was! We ended up at JJ instead and have never looked back. The beer is ice cold and the service warm and friendly. The food is always fresh and tasty and I have only had excellent experiences. Last time we brought our baby and they have baby seats available. There is a crazy amount of choice in this area, but JJ Fish Mart is our clear favorite place. Solid 5 stars.

We were there in December and we just loved the food prepared by Master Chef Johnson and the great service by Ramesh and his team.My wife is veg and it was tricky to find pure veg food but Johnson made it happen.Keep up the great job guys!!!CheersManis

I had high expectations of this place as the decor And ambience seems great. However, the food disappoints. The price is cheap but it's not value for money. Let me explain. I had the chirashidon but it was tiny. The fish is fresh but hey, a girl needs to fill her tummy. I also ordered four pieces of shishamo- but they were skinny, not crispy and not filled with roe. Check out the pics

Had a quick lunch here with partner. We had ramen blackpork and salmon. Both didn't deliver in taste and presentation which are quite standard in any establishment serving ramen. I'd hate to say this, but I'd rather have Ajisen compared to this. 2 small pieces of salmon or a couple of morsels for the pork. Far from satisfying to put things lightly. Maybe we shouldn't rate this since it's not really "fish" for one of us but still, some basic standards for a SGD$15 bowl of ramen. Will try something else from here and submit another review but not till my memory of this bowl of disappointing stuff fades for a bit. There are ramen restaurants upstairs that serve excellent ramen by the way

This is a quaint little Japanese restaurant good for a chillax dinner/lunch session. I enjoyed the cold soba there yesterday, accompanied by the sashimi that I chose from the freezer. (You can see from pic) The white tuna maki was a pleasant surprise! It costs $4.50 only but came with generous portions of tuna not seen in most maki, and the tuna was really juicy too. I had the salmon skin aburi as well, portion was not as generous but tasty nonetheless. I rate this excellent cos the quality and ambience is outstanding considering the affordable price.

JJ. Com is located in a mall and the restaurant is open to the mall. We were so happy to have happened upon JJ's. The chef is funny, personable and talented. My kids loved that the chef was so nice and was good at PokemonGo and that the tables were numbered using Pokemon. We enjoyed inkura, a plate of amazing nigiri, and best of all Ankimo - I couldn't believe they offered Ankimo! Sake and Beer served here too! If we return to Singapore, we will absolutely be going to JJ. Com, not once but several times
