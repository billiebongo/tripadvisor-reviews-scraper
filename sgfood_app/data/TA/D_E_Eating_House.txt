A restaurant where good service was the norm. Atmosphere was A okay. But the main thing that got me was the incredible Salted Egg Chicken with Rice. It's to die for.

This eating house is located in Geylang Lorong 17, corner Sims Ave. The place has been there for many years and if you like Slated Egg dishes, look no further, go here. Its a regular coffee shop so dont expect luxury, but instead you get your regular plastic chairs and tables and plenty of air (many fans). The dish I recommend is slated egg chicken or slated egg pork ribs. Freshly prepared while you are waiting and ince it has reached your table...let the joy start! Perfectly seasoned chicken/pork ribs in the best salted egg sauce you can imagine! Prices are fair, and the portions are big enough to "stuff" you! Enjoy
