Bought 6 pieces for only $1. The red bean filling was scanty, texture of the dough was lacking of crisp.

You Tiao is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside when eaten hot. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
The Ham Jin Pang could be more flavourful, not "ham" enough. But texture is good and still an enjoyable eat.

Came here as part of Singapore Food Festival 2017-- this year's Hawker Spotlight shines on Maxwell Food Market. Went on a food tour of some stalls, hosted by Moses Lim himself!You can try your hand at frying your own hum jin pang here, which is really cool. Of course, if you burn it, it's your fault :P A very unique experience & also, of course, it's tasty. It's very affordable at 6 pieces for $1-- smaller than usual, but great bite sized pieces

The stall is grossly undermanned so customers are often asked to help with frying their own dough fritters. I like that their version of dough fritters come in smaller size than the usual. What makes it different and more delicious is that it is coated in caster sugar. Also the dough is well mixed giving the finished product a springy texture. Love them
