We were really disapointed by this restaurant. Food was just ok. But the Price!! It was a robbery!! How can you make people pay 40 sgd for such a basic plate of pasta! Never ever coming back.
4
We probably didn't do this restaurant justice due to jet lag tiredness but we did enjoy it. The menu is totally Italian, pizza's, pasta and specialities. The staff are as always super attentive and helpful. The desserts are lovely.
5
Prego has been around for such a long time but it’s quality and service never wavers. Great news for people looking for consistency. Portions are just nice. Service is warm and staff are at hand constantly for help.
Worth another trip soon.
4
Classic Italian dishes are served here with much glee. Delicious and hearty that fills the stomach and puts a smile on your face. Try the pastas and pizzas as well as the tiramisu to end your meal
4
The service was a little slow on this Valentine's Day, but the staff made sure that all requests were met. The food was of the same high standard as with my previous visits. The tiramisu is a must try!
5
Great atmosphere for business meeting. Good food, especially the pastas and pizzas. Also good selection of appetizers.
4
we had breakfast here and the selection was impressive. there was just so much food to choose from and coffee is served by order which i prefer, instead of something sitting in a pot for a while...
5
Great service, fantastic pasta and prego pizza, family friendly restaurant.
The cheese platter entree is good.
The clam soup is clear.
4
This restaurant is a good choice for a nice casual Italian meal. Located in the Raffles Mall it is convenient for guests of The Swissotel or the Fairmont. The ambiance is very open and casual. The staff was attentive and friendly. The menu choices include, pasta, pizzas, sandwiches etc. The have a limited wine list along with beers and cocktails. The food was fresh, good and arrived hot. Pricing was very good for Singapore which can be a bit pricey
5
The in-house breakfast choice of Cafe Prego is always rewarded with a multi-country buffet. It is constantly refreshed & monitored. The staff are very attentive and so very courteous. Several newspapers choices are available, and great coffee/tea is plentiful. Try the juices or smoothie of the day; tasty, fresh, & plentiful. Great place upon early morning arrival to await your room with a trustworthy breakfast offering
2
Mushroom pizza, very bland, slightly greasy. Too large for one. Very expensive for what it is.
There are much better places in Singapore.
4
They don’t serve water foc which is really a downer considering this is Fairmont and the food is already pricy
4
The food was perfect. The service staff are of quality but unfortunately they were shorthanded during lunch. Coffee was served late and asking for the bill takes them awhile.
5
Our 4th visit to Prego@Fairmont hotel. Love the pizza and pasta they serve. Service is still as good. However they serve ice water for each adult at $3, unlimited top up.
2
First, the service stafft tried to clear the bread before we’re done. Then they mixed up our main orders. After that, they spilled the drinks while clearing it. The restauarnt wasn’t even packed. The service used to be top notched but not anymore.
3
definately large variety of food for breakfast but place can get very crowded and is not worse lining up for 10minutes
3
We went for breakfast. The choice of breakfast was very extensive both Western & Eastern food.The service of coffee, tea is very slow - had to ask a few times before we got our coffee which was already cold when we got it . Very disappointin
1
Prego is just getting from mediocre to below average.I have always found the food pricy for the taste- which is quite ordinary. But I love the complimentary bread (really warm and toasty), the wine selections, the cosy ambience and good service.However, my latest experience has put me off immensely:1. Poor service. Condescending, insincere. I didn't take down the name of the bespectacled Chinese male waiter who served the window tables on 26 Jan 2018- but he basically ignored requests and had a standoffish attitude throughout. When we gave the wrong voucher, he just looked down and then said in a rather rude tone "cannot use".2. They charged $6 for artisan water even though we ordered wine. What is artisan water?!I will no longer visit Prego.
4
A Great way to start your day with Breakfast at Prego.Raja P the Manager always has his eye over the restaurant and is very welcoming.Rosebelle is an Ambassador for Prego she impressed us on Day Two by remembering our Coffee order, warm smiles and efficient service despite the rush.Also thank you to Linda, Rhio, Jessa and Krim who looked after us at Breakfast throughout our stay.What a fantastic way to start our day after being served by you. You are a credit to The Fairmont- Way to Go
4
While staying at the Fairmont we first ate our evening meal as it was my wife's birthday and we didn't want to wonder far after a long flight great service and waiter very attentive we also called for the buffet breakfast and was staggered by the choice,only downside was it got very busy and noisy but still very enjoyable
5
A super value for money set lunch using credit card promotion. The portions are original menu portions and the taste was not compromised just because it was a credit card promotion. Service was excellent. I will definitely go back again.
4
The food was excellent at Prego and the service - impeccable! Prices were reasonable and the ambience- warm and friendly! Definitely worth a second visit?
4
With the Amex dining offer, this is an affordable place for Italian Cuisine. Looking forward to my next visit!
4
Had a wonderful first time dining experience at Prego! Big thanks to Vincent for making the restaurant welcoming and dining enjoyable! Vincent was very attentive to guests' needs and make an effort to recommend dishes on the menu to us.
5
Eat breakfast here.
Also had diner here great menu choice including gluten free options.
Well cooked great staff
3
I love going to Prego especially for their warm bread. However, I am told by the staff that they don't serve plain water and thus need to purchase imported water which cost more than $10 per bottle which is very expensive. Pizza and Pasta is also overpriced
1
Came on Boxing Day with my friends and we were given a seat near the end of the restaurant.Waiter took quite long before we can place our orders and spilt the olive oil on the floor, what he did next was very shocking, he attempted to clean it with his shoes and smudge the area with oil. Food was very ordinary, the pasta tasted like the ones you can get at pastamania.When I asked for the bill, the waiter nodded but took very long and still, I have not gotten the bill, had to remind him again for bill. After giving my card, I had to wait another 15mins for it because THE WAITER FORGOT ABOUT IT AGAIN! Very disappointed by the service of this restaurant
4
Prego Restraunt is a very friendly fine dinning experience and so happy to greet Families with gorgeous little ones. The food offering at breakfast is a delight with many variations and lots of healthy option. Please book if not staying at the Fairmont because this place is very popular even in Jan. All good and be prepared to be greeted with a huge smile on arrival at Prego and a warm goodbye when leaving, it's the one of the best parts of Singapore the smiles and the welcoming for all tourist in this unique town

Restaurant was full with people on Friday evening. At some point it was rather rowdy with noises everywhere. Observed those without reservation were seated on high chairs and may prove difficult especially for ladies wearing skirts/dresses.Went for set dinner menu at $69 pp inclusive of selected anti pasti, selected main course (at reduced portion), Chef special (which is duck confit) and selected dessert. Had parma ham with melon and calamari for appetisers but portion given was much reduced and calamari was disappointing - tasteless in fact. Duck confit was rather salty and quite unbearable. Only saving grace was the tiramisu dessert which was enjoyed.Service was friendly and genuine. Wait staffs were always on look out for diners asking for assistance. Would not specially recommend this place for special occasions unless you just wanted to try out for 1st time. Table reservation is a definite must on weekends
5
I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to get a reservation on Christmas Day. I honestly didn't expect to be able to get a table on that day!Greeted by the staff with a warm welcome and was welcomed by the very lovely dÃ©cor of the restaurant.Service was good and the starters were amazing! I had the most amazing pasta to date. I ordered Linguine Vongole, which had loads of baby clams that were really fresh, topped with garlic, chilli, parsley and white wine sauce! It was heavenly and the portion was just nice!A great place for all occasions! Highly recommended
3
Food took quite some time to come and there were hits and misses with the dishes we ordered. Pizza was great. The seafood pasta would have fared better if they used fresh prawns instead of glass prawns.
2
Novelties not enough for guests.
Birthday cakes cannot be consumed there. Additional charges for extra sauce for the main course and plain water. Rather disappointed with such terms and conditions. Moreover, the good is average. An experience you want to give a miss.
5
Good service and ambience, delicious pizza and pasta! Do try the squid ink pasta, and also the Prego pizza. Burrata is really yummy as well!
5
As expected from a restaurant at a 5 star hotel. Food is good and service is impressive. Definitely recommend of you would like to taste authentic Italian food.
5
As mentioned in another review this is truly a great place to have breakfast. Great value, friendly and helpful staff, and a wide variety of breakfast fare.
Highly recommended for families but also for couples and the elderly.
3
Taste wise, the pastas are pretty good, they taste nice. The seafood in the pasta I ordered was good too.Service wise, the restaurant seemed to be understaffed, getting a waiter's attention was very difficult at certain points as there was only one waiter to be seen manning a large area. The tea I ordered before my food arrived was only served as I was cleaning up my plate. The pastas cost around mid-$30, but I don't see why they would cost this much. I have had other pastas that are equally good or taste better that cost less or the same as this. As such, I don't feel that the prices here are justified. Plus the ambience is more of a casual eating place
3
I have always love to dine at Prego as the food never failed me. However the recent visit showed that there is a severe lack of training n process is all wrong in taking orders including drinks. At such a restaurant if u asked for bottled sparkling water readily available, one does not need to wait for 8 mins. Then upon arrival, u are given green lines when u asked for lemon is so unacceptable. Especially it was just 12 noon ( restaurant just open for Biz). Waiter apologised they run out of lemons! Frankly how difficult is it to go downstairs to Cold Storage Supermarket n grab a crate of lemons. Italian restaurant without lemons at the start of lunch? This just reflected how poor the management is now n many customers had to remind waiters they are still waiting for their food! Reason: a waiter goes around taking orders n did not immediately put in the order ( all paper base). Guess after taking orders from 3 tables, what happened is kitchen is idling until he submits the order in paper form! What a shame as food is really good
4
They say the most important meal of the day is breakfast. Here at Prego, they think so too. All tastes are catered to from hot to cold meals, drinks that satisfy the thirst and pastries and breads galore. We paid to have the breakfast in addition to our room and whilst not necessarily cheap, worth the money
3
Year end catch up with friends and decided to have it at Prego. Food and service were good, especially our server (Kevin??) who was very attentive and fun. However what spoilt the night was the extremenly loud noise made by a table of big party . Noted its year end, hence corporate party but Prego should not allow such group to make such a ruckus which affected our dining experience. Especially they are in an open concept restaurant. Highlighted to Prego during our meal on the loid noise but no action taken by Prego
4
Went for Christmas eve dinner and it was not too bad.The pepperoni was so good that my son was so reluctant to share with us. The carbonara here has always been my favourite and my best.But the portion of the beef was a bit small.Service was outstanding
5
Was looking for a restaurant with a good range of choices for vegetarians and glad we went to Prego. Both vegans and meat eaters were most happy with the food.
5
Prego is consistently a great dining location for anyone looking for great Italian fare. It is even better with the FAR dining privileges.
4
Enjoy coming here and using the Amex Platinum 50% offer for two pax. Always value for money. Keeps me coming back for more!
3
Food was good. Value for money ok.
Charged for 2 drinks I didn’t have
Can get loud if crowded.
Pizza is good. Good value to.
5
Best place to go for a Sunday brunch especially Italian. Antipasto, cheese, pizza's, pasta and Risotto what more could you ask for. There are 5 different stations to chose from.
There is also a dedicated kids' area where they can eat and also make food.
5
Food was great! Loved the mudpie especially.
I would like to compliment Kelly (korean waitress) as well for the superb service.
4
Food at Prego is respectable and reasonably good for the price one is paying for. The menu choices are quite limited though.
4
prego dining at fairmount with family: food is gd but drinks expensive: even charge for water which should be complimentary
4
Umpteen visits here and food is always of good quality. However service standards seem to be dropping. Would be great if they can buck on service!
3
The service was prompted and efficient but the food was average. I had the pescatora and some pizza and sides to share with friends, wasn’t exceptional great. I like the ginger thyme drink i had but that’s not enough for me to revisit again. Overall, felt it’s over priced for its pizza and pasta, there’s a lot of other better restaurants to choose from in the marina area.
5
Prego has always maintained their excellent in service, good quality of food but quite pricey though.
4
Good food but the sound can be much improved .. you can’t really hear yourself hence tough for conversation...
5
Still one of the finest Italian restaurant in the city where food is matched with excellent service!
4
Staff was attentive, food was great. We ordered the Burrata with truffles, salmon and pasta. My pasta was so tasty I couldn’t stop eating it.
4
Its tough to beat 50% discount for two pax by simply paying with the Amex Platinum. Value for money!
3
It’s a really well made place but the food is very average. We ordered the 5 cheese pizza, saffron risotto and some pesto pasta.. it was just ok. Was expecting something better.. also it’s ridiculously expensive for the quality of food.. lot of better places to eat in Singapore..
3
Used to be good over my last 2 visits, however my recent visit was significantly different both in terms of service and food quality. Had the daily specials which was part of the Dinner Set. The sausage was too salty and oily, I barely managed to force myself to finish the first piece and had to forego the second piece altogether. My requests for desserts to be served and also the bill from a waitress was completely ignored. She acknowledged the request but the dessert never came, so did (didn't) the bill. I had to request another waiter to bring me my dessert. As for the bill, I was so annoyed that I had to walk to the front concierge to request for the bill.
5
I would highly recommend this restaurant. Firstly, they have Excellent service. The staff were full of smiles and when our toddler cries, they would try to cheer him up instead of giving stares.As for the food, if are into Italian food, go for it! They have a fantastic chef that really cooks good Italian food as he himself is an Italian.
4
We had a nice meal at Prego. I even got gluten-free pasta and bread. It was, however, super expensive. The wait staff was nice. I had the linguini with clams (with gluten-free penne) and my husband had a pizza. We wanted to get a bottle of wine but it was super $$ so we got a carafe instead. It was 50 Singapore dollars so that was super $$ but it was all tasty and good
3
Staying at the Fairmont, so with jet lag looming on the first evening in Singapore--we went to Prego. A bit disappointing, menu had all kinds of spelling errors which could be forgiven if the food had been exceptional but it wasn't. The pizza was ok but at 38SGD I felt it was overpriced but it is attached to a hotel. My friends had pasta and again it was ok but not memorable. Service could have been better as well, we waited almost 20 minutes to get our check
5
Weekend dinner with my daughter as she wants to try the seasonal menu at prego. It turned to be a great dinner as she enjoyed the dishes she ordered.
4
Service was attentive and friendly, from start to finish.
Food was good, and when using promotions the value is also good (Eatigo app, Eat Play Live app...). Without promotions it is pricey.
Quite full on a Sat night, remember to book.
5
Pastas, tiramisu and creme brûlée were really delicious!! Service was pleasant, will come back again soon!
4
Our second visit in a week.The food was good - minestrone was very tasty & laden with vegetables, veal cheeks melted in the mouth - the wine was well paired (Chardonnay with roast cod was particularly good) - and the service excellent (thank you Vincent Lam!).As with all Italian restaurants worldwide, the cost was the top end of acceptable.Will go back
2
We have dined at Prego on quite a few occasions over the past 20-years. However after our recent experience we are unlikely to return.As on previous occasions, the restaurant was very crowded. However it seemed like there were either insufficient waiting staff or the staff were poorly trained as they were struggling to respond in a timely manner to guests' requests.We both ordered pizza (both thin crust - maybe all the pizzas are....?). My partner's pizza was clearly under-cooked. Beneath the barely cooked top, the base was raw dough. It was as if the chefs had too many pizzas to prepare so cut back on the cooking time. My pizza was okay - but certainly did not justify the price ($34).To be fair, my partner spotted a chef walking through the restaurant and called him over to complain. The chef offered to replace the pizza but there was no point as I was already half way through my meal. When the bill came we were not charged for his pizza
4
Prego has been around for more than 20 yrs (at least from my first experience). The food remains wonderful, but there has been other changes...When I first visited Prego in the 90s, the service was superb. All you need to do to get attention was to look up from your food and someone would be over in a moment, to assist in whatever that you need. But there was a period a few years back, when the service was less than stellar... you needed to really 'raise your hand'..etc, to get the staff's attention. In the latest visit, it is slightly better, but there was also an occasion when a customer had to point out to the staff that I was trying to get his attention. A suggestion to Prego - still water should be available to customers.... not as another item on the menu. Especially if the customer ordered a wine to go with his/her meal
4
Had a farewell lunch with colleagues. Had calamari, beef lasagne, fungi pizza with truffles.... with sparkling water!!Portions so generous that we have no room to have dessert ( kicking ourselves now). Their mud pie is heavenly but just could not eat anymore....book in advance n ask to sit away from the main entrance n main walkway n you can have a wonderful lunch with conversations with friends
4
I love the bread at Prego which is served with any meal. They are freshly baked and warm and served with pate. It is a generous portion so factor that as your carbo dish when you are placing your food order. Service is friendly by most of the staff. The only downside of the place is they charge $3 per pax for table water (apparently filtered water which they brand as “Artisan Water”). Otherwise you have to pay for sparkling or stilled water which is even more expensive and unnecessary. Their pizzas are delicious with very thin crusts
1
Went there for anniversary night. What a disappointment!How wrong can one go with pizza? Turns out, a lot!Expected much more authentic food at a Fairmont restaurant that’s exclusively Italian.Ordered a vegetarian and the rustic pizza. Flavorless and overloaded with flavourless cheese. Felt like a half hearted attempt at cooking.Don’t thing I’ll be visiting again
5
Service was prompt, with staff attending to the needs of every customer. Once we were there, they gave us a choice of still/sparkling water, and red/white wine. Food was amazing, with my favourites being the truffled cream pasta with sauteed mushrooms, which was light and pasta was cooked al dente, and the tiramisu, which was so so light!. One of the places to get great Italian food if you're craving for it
4
Great food & good ambience . good for casual hangout or chill out, however, more attentive service will be make the place more happening!!!!!
5
Another visit to Prego. The food, service and ambience is consistently good. One of the reasons why we keep going back.
4
Good food and good portion. Good to share. Tables next to the glass frontages are abit sunny for lunch. But they have the auto blinds which will block out the hot sun.
4
Enjoyed the food. Using Amex Platinum here is a must to enjoy 50% discount for two pax. Would come again
4
Singapore is not the easiest places to eat if you are more inclined on European Food. It took us a long time to discover this restaurant. Loved the Pizza and the Lasagne and other stuff. Very very efficient staff, nice welcome (even though the restaurant is attached to a hotel). Head for the Raffles complex, you will see Robinsons, turn rightk walk along on the left hand side and follow the road around. You will not miss it
4
We have been to Prego many times and service was usually prompt. However, our visit today on a public holiday was somewhat not up to expectations. Firstly, the set lunch menu has had some changes. For example, my favourite fusili with crabmeat and asparagus has been taken off the menu. The price for set lunch seems to have increased too. And I was surprised that they charge $3 per pax for tap water! We used to enjoy attentive service. However, today staff were not looking out at diners. It can be irksome to find them avoiding eye contact and I had to literally wave to get noticed. I hope the service will improve. And if they can bring back the fusili with crabmeat
5
I really luv this restaurant. Various yummy menu of food and dessert, excellent hospitality, nice ambient, positive vibe feels like home, nice interior, very kind, polite & helpful staffs, no need too long to get table and easy to get the staffâ€™s attention.I also had my breakfast there. It was buffet. It was perfect. Totally worth visiting.
4
We had the Chef's dinner set menu. Delicious and refreshing Caesar Salad, though pieces of the Calamari Fritti was a bit chewy. For the primi platti, we had the delicious penne carbonara and spaghetti pescatora with fresh seafood. The Chef's special was fish and it was fresh and well executed. Finish off with their yummy house signature Tiramisu and a cup of coffee. Good value. The place was crowded but the service personnel were attentive and friendly.
4
We celebrated Hubby's bday with his favourite italian fare here at Prego. Service by a chinese gentleman was wonderful - sorry didn't catch his name. He was attentive, knowledgeable and thoughtful. He even squatted down to connect with my little one and got her a cup of apple juice even though the kids menu doesn't include one. The break basket with the two little tubs of cheese were heavenly. We ordered pasta, pizza and veal cheeks. All devoured by our party of 5 and satisfied. Agree with some of the other comments about the $3 per glass of water - our only complaint
4
If you are staying at the Fairmont, in the morning they have the breakfast buffet here for guest. They have quite an impressive spread of options in the morning, definitely something for everyone and was vegetarian friendly. Also had dinner here after a day full of exploring, I managed to crawl my tired legs here for food. The service was excellent and friendly, and the food was quite good. Whether its breakfast or a good pasta dinner you are in need of, this place has you covered
4
Authentic Italian cuisine with freshly made pasta. Service was excellent. Unfortunately charging $3 for water is a no-no for me
4
My go to place for homely and quality Italian food with the family. Prego had never failed to surprise and entertain me.
4
I've always enjoyed my meals at Prego. The service is always good. The selection of food is decent. The only thing is that they charge $3 per person for water.
4
Went early evening, friendly and efficient service.
Food was really tasty Italian, could have done with a bit more!
Was asked if we wanted water, then after it came bottled realised we would be paying for that also 😂
4
Service and food were excellent , there were 5 of us and all enjoyed the food.We thought the wine list was a little pretentious, and had a cocktail instead.Later we found a shop that sold Austalian wine , Clare valley and Margaret River for about $10 AUD more that Perth so it can be done to have realeastic wine prices on the list 
4
came here for lunch during a work day, and we had the executive lunch sets. the mains were rather decent, accompanied with starter bread, choice of parma ham/ salad, and dessert. service was prompt and friendly. only downside was that they did not offer tap water
3
I must say that even though it was a weekday, there were few staff serving us and I often had to "work" bery hard to get their attention.Otherwise food was good and tad expensive but its a restaurant in a 5-star hotel so pricing was expected
4
Visited Prego after seeing that it had good reviews for Italian food. We were not let down with the quality of food and service. However, it was a little expensive for what we had. The beers are not cheap, so do check beforehand. A bottle of Peroni cost us $14 each which was way more expensive that we find in London (and that's saying something!
4
Ambience of the place offered a good view of the city. Food was abit expensive but well worth the price due to the kind of ingredients they offer in your pasta or pizza. Still or sparking water is ridiculously expensive going at SG$12/Bottle while normal tap water is going at SG$6/Caraf. Would rather pay for a glass of wine at SG$12 instead. Depending on what you ordered, the taste varies. Recommended to choose something with sauce for pasta as mine was too bland and dry.
5
Awesome food. Same quality as London or Milan, with the same prices! Carry your wallet to the most expensive city in Asia. Great pizza. There are few deals in Singapore, esp at that location. Drink prices vary wildly by time of day. Best 'deals' are at lunch
3
Its a big space for an Italian restaurant. Menu is quite extensive. We both had a lasagna for a quick lunch. Taste has no wow factor. It was ok for taste. Expected more! Its was about $34 per dish.
4
Very good food in a pleasant atmosphere with excellent and attentive staff. A little expensive but as it is linked to a 5 star hotel not surprising
4
I love it here. Fantastic real Woodford pizza. Available for takeaway too!! Lovely pasta dishes & food wines & beers... bright and airy. Always busy but you can still have a private meal.
Good service, good food not too pricey!!
3
I usually boycott restaurants that charge for water especially restaurants that charge more than 60cents, Prego charges $3 per pax.
4
We celebrated our girl friend's birthday at Prego and everyone had a great time. Very attentive staff (Kelvin, if I get it right). Food has been consistently good.
5
Please look for Jessa. She is patient, courteous, friendly, efficient and professional.
Compliments to the Chef and team for the very delicious aglio olio pasta, prego pizza, soups, focaccia with tomato paste etc.
Thank you.
5
Beautiful and extensive breakfast. Dinner was so good too. The staff are genuinely friendly, efficient and courteous. Without exception, they all make you feel at home. Wonderful memories of our stay at Fairmont and our dining experience at Prego. Special thanks to Raja P and Shila. We hope to see you again.Highly recommend this authentic Italian restaurant. Grazie
4
Typical of an italian restaurant, bread is served with the spread of the day. Avoid overloading on those though since it's unlimited and can be quite filling.I and my family members have visited a few times; Pizza is delicious and so is the pasta.I went there due to the restaurant tie-up with Amex platinum card, without which, it'd probably be a dent in my pocket
3
This review is for the breakfast buffet.While conveniently located from the Fairmont hotel, this place just isn't up to their standards. The food and selection was above average for buffet standards, and had every ethnic cuisine known around Singapore, as well as some western items. Pretty much everything I tried was well-made.The layout is very confusing. It's in two divisions and you have to walk ~80ft to get to the other side to see what's there. The service is what really annoyed me. During a late breakfast, the whole service crew aggressively turns over the front of house for lunch. They were slamming glasses, chairs, plates, silverware, etc like as if they were on a time limit. By doing that, it pretty much tells the patrons to "get out", it's terribly loud and doesn't make for a relaxing breakfast. At the higher price of this place, you'd expect much better than that. I recommend Gastronomia Di Paolo or Tiong Bahru down the escalator instead
5
Suppose to go for High Tea but since it was fully booked, sadly, we went over to Prego and surprisingly it was not disappointed and lifted up my spirit. The food was excellent from the quality, taste to varieties offered. Staff are attentive especially Kelly. She is very helpful and quick in clearing our empty plates. Really a good start for celebrating my wedding anniversary. Kudos and keep up everything. We will be back very soo
4
Thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The ambience is what you would expect from a large restaurant. We found the service to be efficient and sufficient. The Tiramisu is a winner for desert!
4
Taste wise I have tried better Italian fare in Singapore but value wise, 50% discount for two pax is hard to beat when you use Amex Platinum. Overall good value for the price you pay.
5
The food was really good - especially their seafood risotto! It was creamy and every bite has a burst of seafood flavour! The ambience was cozy and nice. Definitely going back again!
4
Prego has a casual atmosphere and it is definitely a family-friendly establishment. Bread was served at the beginning of our meal. We tried both pasta and risotto, and would say the latter is better. Would be back.
4
Though did not visit Prego for awhile but still find their service good . Quality of food is also maintaining the same but now they charged $3 per head for mineral / sparkling water . Will return
5
A wonderful Italian experience - We would all recommend this restaurant for a fine dining Italian experience.
4
Food is as usually good. Service staff on 29/8 lunch weren't as competent as we always had. Otherwise overall good
4
Really good Italian food.
Great decor and comfortable setting.
Service needs improvement.
Reasonably priced and nice sized portions.
4
Breakfast buffet is amazing. Continental and Asian/hot food is pretty good for a hotel buffet. The ala carte menu has good healthy options. for other meals, try out the pizza and pasta. One of the better places in SG. The olive oil pasta is amazing and almost all pizzas we liked
3
Had dinner recently as I was staying at Fairmont. Client told me it was one of the better Italian spots in Singapore.Well, it is far from it.Service to order was less than stellar. It took some time to place the order and longer to get our bottle of wine.Pizza was average at best though the types of pizza sounded good - what was delivered was fair.Pasta dish was okay. Pasta was good but the sauce or ragu was again, fair at best.Desert was the highlight - tiramisu was very good, gelato was along the other line and fair.Will think twice as it was fairly pricey for what was average or less
5
Food was great but service can be improved. There was lipstick stain on one of the glasses and quite disappointed.
5
Service staff was warm and attentive. Food was excellent. Would have been even more ideal if the bread was served warm.
5
Been awhile since I've come to Prego, but the food is just a good as I remember it to be! Menu seems to have changed slightly, with my old time favourites not on it anymore, but the other menu items are still done well.
5
We had breakfast here for four days during our stay in Fairmont in July/Aug the spread is excellent with an excellent atmosphere for breakfast. quite a huge place! with views to the outside.
4
The pasta and pizza were really awesome and packed with rich flavours. Highly recommended for visit!
5
We decided to eat at prego as we had an early flight to catch and we're staying at the Fairmont which adjoins this restaurant. The pizzas were lovely and the pastas very well cooked and flavoursome. By Singapore standards, the price was reasonable. The staff were polite, very helpful and went out of their way to provide great service.

Been a long time since we have been to Prego. The quality of the food is still there. But the competition for Italian food in Singapore has risen. Many good Italian restaurants in Singapore with value for money meals. Still it was a pleasant place for Italian food.

After finishing my work at 9pm, we were hungry and don't know where can we have a good dinner. Prego just pop into my mind for the good food and great service.We were there without reservation and Rose was able to arrange a good table for us.We ordered the Seabass and Steak and i whisper to the server that if they are able to surprise my wife since is her birthday.The seabass is fresh as expected, steak was done to the right way, juicy and tasty.Ambiance of the place is good, not too crowded, not too noisy. We can chat and talk about little nothing. At the end of the dinner, the server presented us a little cake with Happy Birthday written on the plate. This is very nice of them and my wife greatly appreciate Prego's arrangement. The evening ended well with the dessert before we head home.Thank you Preg

Prego is a lovely place and the food was similarly good. Service wasn’t the fastest or best, but we weren’t in a rush, so that didn’t bother us. The price, however, was a disappointment - it was far too expensive for the quality and portion size, with the drinks being especially overpriced. We got a 40% off deal on Eatigo, which made it more palatable, but still expensive, as it doesn’t include drink
5
The oysters and snow crab legs were super fresh and delicious. Also kudos to the nice spread of Italian cold cuts, including the decadent parma ham which was well sliced. Desserts were also very good. Hot food selection was small but all the items were quite tasty.
2
Needs advance booking. food was just okay. Nothing great in taste. prices seemed reasonable. Options available for vegetarians
5
The prego team was attentive to pay to enquiry/ special request and offered a complimentary dessert with "Happy Birthday"!

It's been ages since I've revisit Prego. The food remains good and staff are friendly. It's a great place for catch up with friends and family.
4
Though nothing fanciful on menu, you can be assured for consistent, delicious, simple and fresh homely Italian cooking. Been visiting for years and have never been let down. Only gripe being that the place can be noisy for peak dinner timings.
5
The breakfast was delicious and the choices were extensive. We always had a table within a couple of minutes. You have to try the waffles and orange butter cream...most delicious I have had. The staff were all fantastic.

Conveniently located at Fairmont Singapore, it serves up delicious Italian food which is reasonably priced, provided you get the 50% discount for 2 pax with the Amex Platinum Card

Had lunch in prego: overpriced even for Singapore, you feel like you are in a canteenNo particular flavors in the dishes. A big disappointment especially for the price: a good advise if you like Italian food: go across the street to Beach Road kitchen where the chef is Italian and they know how to make tiramisu, pasta and pizza

I'm certainly pleased to experience an improved customer service of Prego @ Fairmont SG.1) I had a pleasant tele-con with the F&B - Feed At The Raffles while making an impromptu dinner reservation. The Restaurant managed to reserve a quiet corner window table on a Friday evening for 2 pax as per my request. 2) Staff is attentive, take our order promptly & relatively knowledgable in sharing the promotional a-la-carte menu of the month. Shila is particularly friendly & helpful with her recommendation of Dessert: Kahlu Gelato 3) Food is served efficiently, and tastes good (unsure if there's a changed of Chef, as the last time I patronised the restaurant was in Feb 2016. I had an awful encounter - Waiters/Waitresses were untrained; Fungi Misti Pizza tasted funny; Seafood Linguini was lousily prepared; Signature Dessert 'Tiramisu' was not as good as it acclaimed!). Overall, I am satisfied with the dinner I had on Friday, 4 Aug 2017 (see attached photos). This is because of the 1 for 1 discount I enjoyed as an Amex Platinum Cardholder. Additionally, I redeemed 2 bottles of complimentary house red, Cabernet Sauvignon by Santa Digna 2014 (a dined-in bottle, and another take-away). Keep up the good work!

Went there for lunch. Staff need to come back 3 times when I enquire about credit card promotion. After ordering, waiter came back from kitchen informing that their calamaris were sold out for the day (12pm) and need to change (5 sets) to another dish.Staff cross hands with my friend while clearing the empty plates. This can be avoidLove the bread. Water charging at $3 per Pax
3
Lovely ambiance, family friendly Italian restaurant, very good service. Local customers as well as visiting tourists. Convenient for Fairmont guests although I understand that it is an independent business. Food would be rated good average in Australia - but this is Asia, so what is a fair rating? Nice Italian wines and my waitress Sheila delivered mine with Silver Service flair, definitely not an average waitress
3
Food is ok but personally feel is over priced. For that kind of pricing i can get a real deal in fine dining. Resturant is not what i expected. So noisy like food court.
2
Expensive for what it is and we got off on the wrong foot when I asked for iced water and was told they do not serve this. Buy a bottle or no water given. I shall not return.
4
Good ambience and value for money.good food and view of places around the restaurant.must visit if have time.
3
Restaurant was spacious and service was great. Food was served promptly and in decent portions. Nice place for family and friends gathering.
4
Enjoyed more sumptous #dinner in SG: the #proscuitto, ham with fresh Australian melon, as a great starter, seafood pasta, home-signature #pizza, chef-selection baked chicken. Tiramisu was then a delicious closure. Pairing was the #chianti #redwine, which was really nice. It was my 2nd visit to the #pizzeria: Prego pizzeria at #fairmonthotel #FairmontSG and they gave me another enjoyable experience dining with them. Great foods, nice ambience, hospitable staff. #Italianfoods #Italia

I was quite impressed by the selection of food during breakfast at Prego, so after reading some good reviews, I decided to have dinner here, but food is just okay.. I can't say great.One point to raise is: Breakfast gets really busy in the morning but instead of bringing people in, everyone gotta wait outside to be ushered to their table by only one staff
4
Prego offered a decent Italian meals with good pastas and anti pastas. Not in love with the fact that we have have to pay for water but at least they offer options of sparkling water. Felt compelled to write a review this time as I felt they have upped their service. My friend casually enquired about gluten free options and this was followed through by the all the wait staff. Good job in communicating between the staffers!!Good job on that
4
Went for a dinner last night 11 July 2017 and was impressed by the attentiveness of the staff not forgetting the ambience of the restaurant.We ordered 2 antipasti and 4 mains. We were quite disappointed with the squid ink spaghetti as it was too dry and bland. 2 thumbs up for their linguine vongole and their complimentary focaccia bread with their delicious spread.The rest of the dishes did not really blew us away and if you ask me if I will go back again, answer is no because the food standard has really dropped quite significantly.But they should be applauded for their service and ambience
5
As one of the early Italian restaurants in Singapore, this is an old favourite that continues to be good even as its competition has grown tremendously. It continues to serve excellent bread with pizzas and pastas. The calamari is still good and the tiramisu is a still good after your meal.
3
Good food but standard of service has dropped from my previous visit last year. All food are self help from the buffet counters including the live cooking stations. In my previous visits, the serving crews would take order from the guests at their table for main course orders and served the food at the tables. This is the drop of the service standards. Overall the brunch is still good. From Kim Lo

Craved for ravioli and was around the corner.
Worst dinner ever. Too expensive. No quality and there are many better places in singapore.
Singapore is so small- just go somewhere else please. Do not try this.
4
Had dinner with a friend and we both enjoyed our meal of squid ink pasta and pizza washed down with white wine. The servings pasta serving was not large but the delicious bread with accompanying olive oil and garlic-tomato dip was filling.
4
It's our numerous visits. We like the ambiance. Friendly staff and of course the food. Freshly bread for the start and this time we ordered their special soda which is very refreshing. Pizza as usual is crispy and with its italino authentic taste. Lamp chop is cook to the tenderness yet melt in ur mouth. Indeed a good diner.
5
Prego is one of best place in Singapore to eat breakfast and we always bring our relatives or friends to enjoy good variety of food, fresh juices and coffee (cappuccino and latte) or tea normally on Saturday.We start by ordering our tea (either English breakfast or Earl grey). Then follow by fresh juices at the counter (normally detox or antioxidant). We then go over to look for American breakfast, omelette, tim sum, Indian prata and chicken porridge. There are so many variety of pastry, malt, cereals, yoghurt, bread, cheese and fruits.We try to come as early as 6.30am and enjoy the morning reading the Straits Times or chit-chatting with my wife, relatives and friends.We recommend you to come early as there is no reservation for breakfast and enjoy a sumptuous meal. A great start for the day
5
The Prego is a wonderfully decorated and laid out Italian restaurant. It is quite large but being broken into sections, is very cosy with a great ambience. Food is excellent and reasonably priced, and the service from all staff was excellent. We will definitely be going back again for an evening meal. Breakfast selection is also huge and very tasty. Most is a buffet style arrangement, but the chef will cook your eggs anyway you like them. The only problem is control, there is so much to chose from and it is all delicious so going back for seconds an thirds and fourths etc.... is a problem if you are trying to watch your weight
5
This was my second visit to the restaurant & first time using an app for discount. It's quite a good deal considering that they use quality ingredients, and you can taste the freshness & seriousness in how they make the food. They even had a reasonable list for children's menu. Service was impeccable, staff were attentive to our needs and food was delicious. However, do note that there's a charge of $3/person for ice water (refillable). It's a little steep but you can always opt not to order water. They provided a small box of freshly made bread for us to share while waiting for our food. We had Calamari Fritti, Capelli d' Angelo all'Aragosta, Filetto di Manzo, Prego Pizza and a child Spaghetti BologneseWith three adults and two children, after the app discount, our bill came up to $107. Will we be back again? Definitely. :

Food here is poor for the price. Wine is also very expensive. Décor is really naff, however - tables are plastic and all tableware is very worn. Laminating menus is also really low end - you really can't do this, guys, when you're charging $150 for a meal for two. The whole affair is the sort of thing you'd find in a 3 star hotel and not a 5. In the UK, we would expect to pay at most £40 for this meal. Here we spent double that. I know Singapore is more expensive but we have had some extraordinary meals here over our week long stay for the same money. Management should really adjust pricing or else increase quality. It's busy, I'm sure, because of where it is and not what it is. A real let down.
2
This is one of the options to have breakfast at from the Fairmont. Its crazy crowded which makes it impossible to enjoy. Buffet style and you are always in line being bumped by guests and staff alike - by the time you sit to eat what isn't on the floor is cold and nast
5
The food was a little on the pricey side but in terms of quality a definite winner. The pizza and pastas are excellent. The staff were friendly and very thoughtful to give a slice of cake as we were celebrating someone's birthday. Great place to go and will definitely be back !

I've not seen my friend in years. I was in SG for a quick trip, messaged her, she was flying out but made time to meet up.She suggested this place and it was a good choice.We started with wild mushroom soup - creamy just so. Then we had Insalata Caprese - the buffalo mozzarella was sooo soft and heavenly - combined with tomatoes in balsamic vinaigrette, we were off to a good lunch!For our main course, we shared a generous plate of lamb chops with grilled asparagus. It was grilled medium well and it was sooo so good- tender and easy on the palate.Of course, to end a good meal, we had delicioso dolci tiramisu with a good cup of Italian cafe. Coupled with a hearty lively funny conversation, it was sooo good we didn't realize it was time to go so my friend can catch her flight. Oh, the staff were friendly and on the ready at all times but one could see they were undermanned. They were all over the place trying to attend to every table's needs
5
One of best buffets in town and value for money if one has FAR card. Fresh pasta station and seafood spread are worth checking out.
4
Ambience and service is good. The calamari and bread is delicious. Personally not a fan of tiramisu but my friend compliments the quality.
4
Prego's pasta, pizza and desserts were very good and flavorful. Good service and friendly staff to complement too :)
3
Decent venue for Italian food in a central location. Will try the Sunday brunch next time. Also do try out the Tiramisu!
5
Fantastic range of breakfast food from all over the globe. Able to relax and enjoy along with newspapers etc. Very friendly staff
4
The tiramisu was a bit too soft and wet. I believe it has stayed outside the fridge for too long. It can be better.
4
Had a lovely time at the restaurant, celebrated Father's day. Good for sharing and everyone had something they liked.All dishes were very yummy; had 25% discount with OCBC cardDownside was they didn't serve table water, and distilled/ bottled water was chargable at $3 eac
4
All four of us all had a great time at Prego. Staff who served us was friendly and as always the food (we had crab meat pizza, grilled lamb chop, lobster angel hair, 3 desserts and bottle of red wine) was marvelous!! We literally wipe out all of them :
3
Pregos overall standard has dipped.The meal we had was a total of 175 for two with no wine.We had a set lunch plus 2 starters and a pizza.General quality is average at best with some considered below average if you grade it against the price.The Buratta at $28 was so so with not so great heart tomato and garden herbs.The prawn carpacio whilst looking nice was overpowered from the truffle flavoured oil making the dish average.Better options elsewhere and at lower overall prices even in prime areas
3
Prego is situated near the lobby of the Fairmont & easy to find. We had to book ahead,It is a largish restaurant with many family groups & so quite noisy. I ordered spag marinara (called spag xxxxxxxx in Singapore) & it was very yummy with lots of seafood. My wife ordered ravioli & she thought it quite ordinary. Luckily neither of us were too hungry because portion size was well below what we are used to in Oz. Also not all that cheap either.Locals get served tap water in carafes but we did not realize this & got charged for a bottle of water. Beware
4
Free flow of bread with cheese. Nice food but less than expected. Compensated by staff who are pleasant and attentive. Great service.
Spacious restaurant layout and warm lighting.
Central location above City Hall MRT Station.
5
We stayed at thr Fairmonthotel in Singapore where Pregos is. We tried the early bird 2 course set meal. The courses we both tried were absolutely delicious and very well made. Couldn't fault them. Good value for the early bird meal too. Fully recommend.
5
Most likely one of the best Italian restaurants around Asia. Food was heaven! Also don't miss to pass by the shop!
Thanks to Chef Antonio!!
Will be back.

Prego Fairmont, fantastic service provided by all staff, especially Jamie who made extra effort with our coffees each morning and lovely coffee art. It made our stay, you made us feel very welcome. Thankyou to all 😃

**Note: This review is for the dinner service. The breakfast buffet that's included as a suite customer is just fine.I've eaten great meals all around the world, and Singapore stands out as a particularly fantastic place to eat fantastic food from many regions. Unfortunately, I consider Prego to be one of the worst values of anything I've eaten during my multiple stays in Singapore and multiple stays at Fairmont.If you want the short version, here it is. The food is only mediocre and the price is outrageous. I love spending lots of money on a top tier restaurant, but this is a disgrace: Two mid-priced entrees, an appetizer and a salad for $140. No wine, just the mentioned items. And unlike many restaurants nearby that give a Fairmont discount, you'll pay full price here.The food was quite lackluster. We had some fried calamari which was very rubbery (it couldn't have been fresh at that consistency) and lacked salt. I had a good caesar salad, with white anchovies which were a nice touch. Then we had mains. My pork cheeks were tasty on the level of quality buffet fare, but surprisingly small portion and no rice or pasta to go with it. It was a strange appetizer that left me hungry for more food. The ambiance is pretty awful, too. The place was designed for its morning buffet, and the seating arrangement works for a quick breakfast. But for dinner, and especially at these prices, being crammed into a 2-top with very little table space is just an embarrassment. Everyone looks like they're being pushed to one side of the restaurant and shoved up against one another. The establishment is also VERY loud. Lastly, the service is unfortunately very poor. It's hard to say this because generally speaking, service at Fairmont is very good, but I've noticed poor service both times I've eaten here (over the span of 4 months). Not only are we eating bread several minutes before any water arrives, we're constantly having to prod our waiter for more water (even though it has been empty for many minutes), or asking him for the check several minutes after it's clear we're done. The waiters here look like they are stretched far too thin and only have time to react. I've eaten at Prego a couple of times for dinner. Both times, it was because we were tired and just wanted something quick/nearby. And each time, I was left regretting the meal. The food was mediocre despite the exciting descriptions on the menu, the service was poor, the ambiance was rushed and cramped, and the price left us shocked at how much better of an experience we could have had if we had just walked across the street or even across the mall. Please save yourself the trouble: Prego is a bad spot on an otherwise great city and wonderful hotel
5
It's normal not to want to eat in a hotel when the culture of Singapore is just outside but this place is wonderful. Excellent service, wonderful menu with great specials, and Claudio the Italian in Singapore is the manager and he knows how to make your evening great. Just walk downstairs
5
Food and service are excellent as usual. Four of us, ordered two starters (calamari and baked eggplant), and four mains (seafood risotto, oxtail ragu pasta, salmon, and linguini vongole). All good. Only downside whenever I eat here is that the air-conditioning could be cooler. A bit pricey if you don't have any credit card discounts
4
The restaurant was somewhat noisy because tables were fully occupied. However the food was superb, especially the crab meat cum asparagus pasta with lovely white source, very yummy. The vegetarian pizza was worth the try too. Considering the crowd there that night, service was satisfactory. Overall it was a pleasant evening at Prego
4
Recommended this place to my friends and glad that they enjoyed it as much as me. Service staff (Shila) was super busy but never fail to deliver every request with a smile *thumbs up*. Food served was hot and nice - portions are good for sharing
1
What happened to Prego? Bread was served cold, no butter given. Seafood Spaghetti $30odd served with frozen prawns, noodle was still a bit too hard.Bacon Penne $30odd, was too dry, taste was lacking. Calamari batter needs improvement. Caesar salad was the saviour. Wanted to order more but was disappointed with quality and taste, left to elsewhere. Service was good. They don't serve plain water but artisan water at $3per head. Was my favourite place when I was a teenager. Please improve so I can come back
3
The price is high, not much variety. If without the 50% discount, I dont think I will visit. Thanks for Amex card .
4
Prego is a nice restaurant for a quiet dinner with friends or family. It's got a decent selection of dishes. Service is also good.
3
The veal ravioli was supposed to be chef's recommendation but the meat was really dry and tough. The presentation was good but the recipe needs rework...
4
Good food very happy to try new methods of cookings.shila was very good serving us.full house but still kept her service.
5
service was good and good was excellent. i love the penne arriabata and mushroom soup. The salad was a bit too oily though.
5
First class service from Shila and reception. The minestrone soup, salad, squid ink pasta and pizza- excellent.
4
Ordered the dinner set and the portions were too small except for the dessert. Service was great but food was just alright. Not much wow factor. There's room for improvement n more consistency with the pasta.
4
Lobster pasta and prego pizza were good.. pasta was fragrant while pizza had crispy crust.. good service too :)
5
My friends and I had a great time. The food was great and the service staff is friendly and attentive. Keep up the great work.

I haven't eaten at Prego for a while and thought we would come for lunch. From the start of the meal to the end I was really distressed. I had overseas guests and was terribly embarrassed by the long wait to be seated. First you had the lady check the reservations which somehow took some time - perhaps they should update the software or whatever system they use? After locating my reservation, we had to wait for a rare oddity known as a wait staff to seat us. There were apparently only a handful of these as we waited a while for 3 parties ahead of us to be seated. Once seated my guests asked for cold water only to be told we would've charged $3 per person for water. That was really disappointing. After that we perused their menu and looked for that rare oddity to take our orders. You can forget finding one. I finally left my seat and hunted down a lady at a serving corner. She smiled prettily and said wait. And yes. We waited. And waited. The service was simply deplorable and really marred the dining experience. The food was okay - usual pasta dishes and pizza. The prices were not value for money. An experience never to be repeated.
5
I had a wonderful dinner with my Wife at Prego. We ordered the lobster pasta and shared a Chef's special set menu. The meal was excellent and looking forward to bring my parents to dine as well!
4
Had awesome time with friends over nice pizza, pasta, wine and dessert at unpretentious ambient. Great service too.
5
The atmosphere is really nice. The decor is similar to what you would see in an authentic Italian restaurant.
1
The food is generally good but for a place like Prego to charge for water is beyond me. Very disappointing.
3
This is a vast restaurant with no outstanding offerings. It;s colorful and bright but way too bustling and active for a relaxed meal.
2
We arrived around 8PM on a Friday night to a packed restaurant, in hopes that the crowd was a sign of good food but sadly it wasn't the case. After a 10 minute wait, we were shown to our table before a rather stale bread basket was served. We started with the calamari, which tasted alright but felt a little too chewy. Then the dreadful pastas arrived...The mister had ordered the squid ink pasta with saffron sauce and scallops. The pasta was overcooked and soggy, had no sauce on it and zero taste of saffron, and served with three thinly cut pieces of scallop which were also overcooked. The angel hair lobster and tomato pasta I ordered was slightly better, but again, overcooked and with very watered down sauce. At 38++ per pasta, it is what you would expect to pay at a hotel restaurant but does it match the quality of food served? Absolutely not. We came here hoping to stay on for dessert but the meal had been such a let down we decided to just call for the bill and leave, and that took another 15 minutes. The staff were polite and probably the only saving grace. I tried asking for a feedback form, in hopes that our feedback would reach the Chef and his team but was told they ran out of feedback forms. We should've definitely listened to the earlier review about the pasta and now just hope that someone from the hotel would look into tasting their own food and improving on the quality.
3
In my recent visit to Prego, food option is very limited for lunch set. But more importantly, food arrived lukewarm and poorly executed. Bread basket served was cold and tasted like leftover. Spagetti Seafood was too watery and diluted. Good customer service made up for otherwise a distastrous business lunch.
5
Always a joy to be back in Prego. This has been one of our favourite dining spots for years. Our family usually looks forward to their yummy breads. However, this time round, we felt that there was a drop in the standard of their breads. Fortunately the main courses were still at an acceptable standard and it was an enjoyable meal. The lamb was fabulous and remains a hot favourite... tender and juicy. Pizza was wonderful though it has to be eaten hot or the crispy base would turn soggy. Do make a reservation or fave the risk of being turned away as the restaurant dies very well even on weekdays.

This Italian restaurant was right at the doorstep of our hotel (Fairmont) and there was an early dinner promotion menu (5pm-6pm). A starter (salad / soup) with a pasta dish for S$18, addition $5 for some premium pastas and also addition $7 for pizza. We’ve ordered the ceasar salad, mushroom soup, fettuccine with sautéed mushroom + truffle sauce, angel hair+ lobster+tomoto pasta dish and end with a chocolate gianduja tartlet. Bread was served after taking our order. The starters were very nicely done and we liked it. As for the mains, the portion on our plates were so generous, we could not finish the fettuccine. Both pastas taste good, but I felt the truffle cream sauce on my fettuccine was too dry and truffle was too mild, I almost forgot it truffle cream. Service was good, so will return to for more Italiano food
5
Nice Italian style restaurant that worked well for a family dinner. The older family enjoyed rib eye, while pizza was favored by the younger. For desserts there were lot of cakes to chose from. Minor crisis when run out of brownies for kids, but something even better saved the day. Thumbs up for the extra service
4
Good food at reasonable prices for the whole family! This has almost become our usual go-to place for classic Italian food.
4
good service. food was served promptly. wide range of food on the menu. will come back again in the future.
5
A great Italian restaurant, where the food and service is always consistently good. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment.
Excellent value for money .
5
A large busy Italian style restaurant within the Fairmont Hotel. Serving excellent pasta dishes and pizzas. A very pleasant place to have lunch or dinner
4
Went for the sunday brunch. Spread was good with seafood, meats, cheese and dessert. However it is a bit on the pricey side
4
We stopped in for a drink and came back the next night for our pre-airport meal. The food was served up quickly and quite delicious. My girlfriend of Italian heritage really loved the anchovies for appetisers. Great service.
5
The meals served here are of high quality and flavour. Lovely surroundings whilst eating and the service was great.
5
We had lovely food at Prego service very friendly and efficient and quick the buffet had copious amounts of food covering Asian Indian and western taste buds very impressive. They had heaps of juices especially the freshly superfood food ones the pastry section with lots to choose from the slab of honey comb with fresh honey was fantastic and the waffles yummy very nice buffet I'll be back for sure we stayed at the Fairmont so well definitely be back agai
5
Good time at Prego, Fairmont Singapore. Even the Set Dinner is such a treat. Parma Ham with Rock Melon, Crab Meat Pasta, Baked Chicken Thigh and Seared Fried Barrumundi and Baked Apple Wedges - the lot for just s$80. Where to find such a deal in the world's most expensive country? Go, try it, but bring the AccorPlus Card on the right days, with pre-set online bookings
3
Had breakfast at Prego when I stayed at Fairmont.While the spread was not bad, the place was just way too crowded. If you aren't a hotel guest, don't drop in for breakfast. Not even a hotel guest at Fairmont would enjoy it.The A/C was also broken on that weekend. Double trouble
4
Classic Italian food done the traditional way. Never underestimate the comfort of simple food done well.
5
Mainly Italian dishes but of great quality. the pizzas are the best in the region. Their selection of wines and beers is very extensive.
4
Good choice for breakfast not as busy as Café Swiss. Very good selection to suit everyone's taste. freshly cooked eggs available. A bit expensive
5
Back at Prego for my mother's birthday dinner, she loved it and so did I. Please do try their seafood risotto, it's delicious!
1
Many many years ago, I enjoyed tremendously on my 1st visit to Prego in Fairmont hotel. After today's visit, I will never be back!There's no atmosphere and the din makes me feels like I am in a local food court!The bread was not fantastic at all. Normally, u will love the bread that the restaurant serve! The chef special test like something they are trying to get rid off!Thanks and no thanks

This restaurant has been here for a long time. Food is high quality and really delicious. Everything we ordered was very good. Only disappointment was they didn't have any freshly shaved Parmesan. They only had the dry powdery stuff. Even though we realised the pasta dishes were tasty without the added cheese but it's disappointing they didn't have it available.Service was hit and miss. A couple people were good but a few others seem like it was their first day on the job. We waited over half hour for our pasta mains even though the starters were fast. We were there at 10pm so it was past the peak hours. Go there only for the good food, not the frills.

Decided to make a reservation at Prego on 18th March 2017 for my families visiting from overseas. Had a very experience when I went there with my wife a couple of years ago and thought it would be a nice experience for others as well.However, I was totally disappointed by my recent visit. First of all, the air-condition was down and the place felt as hot as the wood-fire oven they were using to bake the pizzas despite having a few portable air-condition units. Secondly, I think the restaurant seem short-handed on that day because all the empty tables were not cleaned up with dirty plates and utensils not cleared. This is quite appalling for a restaurant of such good rating. The waiter/waitress all can't seem to be bothered and were not interested in clearing up the plates until after being told a few times to do so. Thirdly, the quality of the food has deteriorated very badly. It doesn't taste anymore like authentic Italian pasta but more like food you can easily find anywhere pay for it for a fraction of the price. The pizza dough was thick and mushy and hard. The pasta was soft and not al dente while the sauce was extremely salty. Lastly, the bill took eons to come which really put me off since I was in a hurry to leave such a terrible place. My kids were so unhappy has it was so hot and they were perspiring quite a lot. I seriously will not recommend anyone this place anymore unless they decide to make major revamps

After a $400 dinner in Szechuan Court, we decided to adjourn to Prego for dessert and coffee. We were told by the restaurant reception to go elsewhere because the restaurant was full.Can someone in the hotel management explain why we were refused entry at 9.20pm when the restaurant was open till 10.30pm and clearly not running at full covers? Furthermore the front section was empty but was told it was closed for breakfast
2
I had dinner here today and it was memorable but for all the wrong reasons. Firstly, it's very rare for a restaurant in a hotel in Singapore to charge for water. They wanted to charge us $12 for a large bottle. However, we then saw another table with water in a carafe and asked and only then they mentioned they do serve water but $3 per person and it's free flow. Which is ridiculous they didn't mention it at the start and also considering the price u pay for a meal there and considering how Singapore water is so easily accessible and can be drank straight from the tap and it is the culture in most restaurants to serve tap water here. Next my main pasta the one with scallop was dreadful. I asked the waitress if it was aglio olio style which she said it was but told me it was dry. I did not really understand the comment till the pasta came. I had no idea what was the topping use but it was dreadful and it was hard to have more than 5 mouthfuls of it. The pasta itself and scallop (which was minimal) was ok but the "sauce" was just awful. To be fair the burrata appetizer was quite tasty but again all largely overpriced and not worth paying for. Would not come back again for reasons mentioned above. Also aircon was not working properly so the restaurant was very warm. Waitress was polite but did not even ask how come my food was untouched.

It has been a while since we dined here and were disappointed the last time as we felt the menu was ridiculously pricey! They had small and large portion sized pasta which we thought shortchanged the customer.Things have improved with regular menu back and thought the set menu was value for money. My Wife had a pasta dish as she's not a big eater while I had the set meal. Ambiance wish, need some renovation as they really look dated. Otherwise, food and service was perfect!Will dine here again

Delicious burrata cheese and pizza 5 flavour cheese is simply fabulous! If you are a cheese lover give it a try I m sure that you won't regret coming!
5
This is my families favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore. The food is autentico and the service is very good.
The service is really good. Make sure to book as it is quite popular.
4
We had a lovely time. Food was good, service was excellent as usual. Restaurant was a bit warm though.
4
Serving size was big thus could only share a pizza, pasta and tiramisu with friend. Mains were tasty and its good value with Far Card dining offer.
5
We had breakfast here each morning while we stayed at the Fairmont (included in our rate) and the spread was amazing. Lots of choices and excellent food/drink.
Highly recommended.
3
Good service but when I call for reservation, the staff told me I will get 50% off as Accor member however the bill is only 20% off
4
loved the bread and cheese spread starter. service staff were attentive and food came quickly even though the restaurant was full
5
So glad that the restaurant bring back their full buffet menu, quality yummy food and offers a wide menu too. The only complaint we had was the restaurant actually ran out of orange juices (part of the menu) 1/2 hour into its operations which I believed was a very basic staple drink!!
5
If staying at the Fairmont, this is a great place for breakfast. The breakfast buffet offers pretty much whatever you might like, and it is all top notch, quality food. They also have great health juices and gluten free options. The fresh fruits were amazing, and the coffee (french press) was excellent. And the service - wow they really go out of their way at every turn. And let me give a shout out to the pastry chef. One item in his area is pancakes and waffles, including one of my favorites banana pancakes. When I came down for breakfast, I saw that morning that he only had regular pancakes and he said no problem, made a special batch of banana pancakes for me and then found me sitting at a table and brought them over to me. Quite awesome

Did the Prego Sunday brunch recently and for the very first time. Have never heard of Prego before this and I was very surprised with the great spread of delicious seafood, salads, cheeses, mains, pasta and desserts. Price wise it is on the more expensive side but the quality of food makes up for it. What we enjoyed: fresh oysters and Alaskan crab legs, Wagyu beef carpaccio, risotto, truffle oil pasta, and desserts. The kids enjoyed the pizza, chicken nuggets, fries and lots of ice cream.At $100++ per pax, this is Probably not the place to bring those who would only have a salad as the main but if you're planning on having a relaxed, Long Sunday lunch, then give this place a try. If you enjoy a glass of vino or two, then go for the Brunch with wine option. Kids 5 and below dine for free. Buon Appetito
4
The restaurant offers a great choice of Italian food, it is smart, clean and the food very good. If you stay in the hotel the bill is discounted.
2
The squid is so tough it is like chewing rubber, even after giving me a second dish. The prawn is tasteless, like those from a freezer. The place is so noisy and the waiters/waitresses are no where to be found.
5
Attentive staff, we are being served very well. Good quality of food, big portions for two. Both my husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Lovely ambience too ! Keep up the good work!
3
Wondered what happened to the chef today as my ravioli was overcooked. With the tomato sauce, it tasted soggy. My partner's mushroom fettuccine was well done though...
3
I was really surprised when Prego informed me there was no booking last evening even though I presented her the confirmed booking number provided by Chope. Their reasoning was the system has changed. It was a good thing they were not full and I was then given a table. Imagine my embarrassment if I couldn't be given a table at all.
5
We had breakfast with my friend, as we were staying at the Swissotel, the food selections on the buffet, was so amazing, live station of eggs, and so as the service was amazing, forgot the name of our server but she was really nice, offered us some coffee and tea to go with our food, and always comes to clear our tables and assist with bringing our plates to the table, some nice singaporean food also to choose from, will definitely come back
2
We had dinner on Saturday, February 25. The experience was very bad and the bill was S$290 for 3 people. It is not the money but what we got for the money is the most annoying thing. The service was very bad. Our starters came so late and Calamari was cold and not cooked properly. The main courses were ordinary and nothing to boast about it. The service was so bad that we had to spend a lot of time drawing the attention of waiters and waitresses to even get a glass of water. Funnily the restaurant was not busy as there were a lot of empty tables. This place used to be good in the early 2000 and has gone down in quality over time but prices have gone up. The management needs to take urgent steps to improve the quality
2
We decided to do an early Valentine's dinner with the kids in tow. The food was good but the service was less than stellar! It took so long for them to get us water! We had to ask 4 times! I think it's unacceptable at a restaurant of such standing. Thankfully it's not my first time or I may never come again. I hope it's just a one off incident and I hope it won't happen again!
2
Food standard has dropped over the last 2 yrs, and it just didn't feel worth the premium price anymore. It was hard to get the service staff's attention and they were rather forgetful in our requests. Furthermore, they are no longer serving tap water for free. Only saving grace was their ribeye was still not too bad. A pity, since they used to have great pizzas.
5
We were just passing this place by chance not really knowing where we were looking for to eat. However stopping and looking at the menu made us decide to stop for something to eat. You it's good when the locals pop in for something to eat.The staff were really friendly and helpful.The menu was large and varied. The portion sizes were large. All courses were well cooked and presented. Also very good value for money. Would I eat here again? Definitely
4
Having Italian in Singapore seems strange - however, we had a very satisfactory meal there. Perfectly acceptable standard of food and excellent, helpful staff. We would happily go back there. This was also the restaurant that provided breakfast for our hotel which was excellent.
3
I find the pasta to be delicious but was quiet disappointed with the mushroom soup. Service is above average but the price is on the high side.
1
Does not feel like I am in an Italian restaurant in terms of service. Plates used are pretty basic, service is mediocre, they had buds of roses but did not even offer each table one. Bad ambience esp for Valentine's Day
2
Overall experience was poor. Service was slow and their fish was not fully cooked. Definitely not value for money and will not return again.

We have tried Prego a few times over the years and every time we left, we used to say we would never go back there again. After a few years, we tried it again for Sunday lunch today. Our AMEX concierge booked it up for us, and confirmed that we could indeed order a la carte for lunch. When we got there, there were quite a few groups waiting to be seated. The restaurant was not busy at all with lots of empty tables but everyone had to wait. When we were then being taken to our table, the waitress mentioned that it was only buffet for lunch. We then asked her to check as we had specifically asked our concierge to check and he had called to book and confirm. As we left, without eating, we again asked the receptionist if a la carte orders were possible and she said no. The restaurant clearly does not have good processes when taking reservations. Either that or the staff are not well trained to understand what the policy is and to ensure it gets not only communicated properly and accurately but is also executed consistently by all its staff. I did call AMEX concierge services to give them this feedback about Prego and managed to speak to the same concierge who had made our booking. He confirmed that he had specifically asked and obtained clear confirmation from the restaurant a la carte orders would be taken at lunch. We will never go there again. Consistently every time we do, there is a very unpleasant experience and we land up getting upset. The hotel and restaurant should take note - your customers and guests are the important ones. Your staff, who have airs and attitude, need to understand who pays their salaries.

@TheKuoKnowsPrego is a surprisingly easy restaurant to miss. Perhaps it's because Prego can't quite decide if it should be part of Fairmont Hotel or Raffles City shopping centre.But now that I have found it, I will return.The first impression you get with Prego is that it will serve a good meal at a fair price. It has the look and feel of a safe pair of hands. And you won't be wrong.The set menu at lunch is more than adequate. My Caesar Salad starter was wonderfully crip. I couldn't have asked for more.The Spaghetti Bolognese, which is always a test of a good Italian chef, passed with flying tricolore. A generous rich beef ragu coating pasta cooked al dente. Can't ask for more, that is until the tiramisu turned up......... what a magnificent specimen of cake, coffee and cheese.The service is in keeping with the standards that you would expect from a top hotel. The waiting staff is attentive, without being over-familiar.Prego gets the thumbs up from me.
1
We know we're in a Asia, but we were in the mood for some Italian food. Usually, wherever you find yourself in the world, Italian has a consistently good standard, globally. However, Prego was our worst experience of Italian food, anywhere. Firstly, our waitress had not idea what a 'Cosmopolitan' was. If you work in a globalized city, international culture has to be a part of your awareness. Your English should also be adequate for communication purposes. This was not the case. When the drinks we were after were finally articulated, we had to wait forever for them to arrive. By the time our dinner had made it to our table, we were still waiting for what were supposed to be pre-dinner drinks. The food was mediocre in quality and taste, and nothing like what Italian food should be. The staff were extremely inattentive and did not check on us during the meal, which meant we had to leave the majority of our food uneaten until such time the plates were taken away. One member of our party had extremely foul-tasting seafood, which she thankfully only ate a small quantity of. It tasted stale and old. Just avoid coming here. It's not worth it.
5
I had breakfast here every morning for two weeks and the staff remembered my name after the second day and knew I maintained a gluten free diet. They always had gluten free pancakes made for me, and brought them to my table.The buffet breakfast had a lot of options, you could have any type of food and specialty juices.
4
Had a pre-Valentine's Day dinner. Prego's food has always been good. It's Risotto, Pizza to Anti-Pasti. However, the wait-help that attended to my table was a young girl who appeared to be local or Malaysian but spoke in Mandarin taking my order, and hard a problem explaining how the dish was done. She looked like a part-timer. I gathered the restaurant is under-staffed but to speak in Mandarin taking an order for an Italian outfit seems like a misfit. She was polite alright but I think it is inappropriate. Ice water wasn't given even when ordered. Side plates weren't given. Just pure lack of service. Disappointed in that aspect that has marred an otherwise good dining experience
4
Look the venue is nice, neat. The menu straightforward Italian, it's exactly what it says it is and that is good.The standout is the beef lasagne, woo hoo just what you want it to be!Closely followed by the ceasar salad.Wind list go, bread at start of meal a generous touch
5
Highly recommend coming by for their breakfast buffet. Great range of options from various cuisines.
4
Service and ambience was great for a gathering of friends. Food was good but not spectacular though.
5
The experience at prego is really excellent. The welcome was warm when i step foot into the restaurant and the servers were really good with their customer service. The food and the environment was really good too.
4
We went to Prego for dinner and found it very nice. The ambience and service both is good. For vegetarians would recommend Aragula salad, pizza and ravioli.
4
Bacon and scrambled eggs done perfectly.
Cherry tomatoes and mushrows were spectacular, such intense flavours.
Cappucino had my name on the foam, but weak.
Pastries and sausages were okey.
Great variety. Worth coming here for breakfast, expensive though.
4
I have visited Prego many times. Have always been happy with the service provided & food was delicious.
3
Overall decent find and service, but don't expect authentic Italian grub. Tiramisu cake is 1 of the better ones in town.
5
There is no limit to the food that they offer for breakfast at this restaurant. Nicely served and excellent presentation by a great staff. Nice surprise for a hotel restaurant!
4
A colleague brought me to lunch just at the turn of the year for a set lunch. Very reasonably priced considering the quality of food. They served fresh baked bread - which I always love, and went well with the vinegar and olive oil. I had Prosciutto di Parma for starters. Parma ham was a little too salty for my liking but still decent and paired well with the melon. For mains, I ordered Spaghetti Pescatora - or seafood spaghetti. It was a nice combination of seafood - all of which was fresh, the spiced tomato sauce only served to enhance the already colourful flavour of the dish. Ordered the tiramisu for desserts, and boy! It's a definite must! I was expecting the typical slice of cake but to my surprise, it was probably 2-3 times larger than what I had expected. Nicely flavoured, and the cinnamon was just right.The staff were polite and prompt with their service as well. I will definitely return to Prego
5
Dined here four consecutive mornings as part of conference I was attending. Very impressed with the immense variety - from Indian food to eggs / omelet station to fruit and cheese offerings to cold cereal bar to breads and pastries bar and finally waffle and pancake section. Particular favorites include the vanilla whipped cream (good for your coffee, pancakes or waffles) and the Oreo muffins (not offered every day). Only quibble is that the hot food was sometimes lukewarm rather than hot, but still highly recommende
4
Excellent pizza
Pasta was not memorable
Dessert? I have tasted much better ones any where else.
Just pick the pizza
Would consider come back for the Cheese mushroom pizza.... yummy. Yummy yummy.
2
Seriously overpriced mediocre food, small portions.
There are many better restaurants in Singapore.
They do a great breakfast spread though.
3
The waitress was very nice but we could barely understand what she said. I ordered the squid pasta and was quite disappointed with hiw dry it was.
5
Indicated that i was celebrating my anniversary during my booking. The pasta and steak we ordered was great. Even added a tiramusu (which was fantastic) and they even threw in a complementary mango cake. Excellent service!!!
3
the food is good but service compromised due to being over crowded. the selection of food is vast including indian, Chinese and Japanese
5
Great food & service as usual. The food was delicious & service was prompt & attentive. We loved the tiramisu, definitely one of the best we had!
1
Had given a positive review to Prego before. That was in the past. Today food is generally terrible! The fish & pizza was passable but the pasta was bland & the calamari was one of the worst we ever ate.I asked for a cup of warm water for my medication & was told that they will charge me $3 for it! Moreover, no more water on the tap. You have to order their bottled water which I think cost $12! And this restaurant is in a country where the tap water is safe to drink. This is another example where profits are more important than the customer. Don't they realised that if there are no customers, there will be no profits
4
My friend and I had a good and appetising salmon and cod dinner at this Italian restaurant in Fairmont Hotel. Would have settled for the ribeye or Wagyu beef if Not for beef diet over the past 2 days! However, we were glad at our choice as they were perfectly cooked. The bread was fresh and yummy too. Ambience was good and so was the service and camaderie. The place was packed with diners as the evening progressed. Definitely a good place to chill out
2
A pet peeve of mine is when nice like this restaurants stop serving complimentary tap water and start forcing customers to buy water. It's tacky and leaves customers with a poor impression of the place, especially if people are paying $30-40 per main. Also, service of the waitstaff has improved a lot but the food has deteriorated. They look some awesome dishes (garlic prawn pizza and lobster bisque) off the menu and the current options are very disappointing (soggy cream cheese and crab pizza?!).
5
Visited for dinner to celebrate an anniversary and I felt compelled to write a review due to the amazing service we received. From the first person to greet us and escort us to our table, to the other members of staff who were consistently warm, attentive and genuinely making efforts to make our experience wonderful, the overall level of service was impeccable. The food came efficiently and prepared perfectly - both the pasta and pizza we ordered were fantastic and definitely worth returning for!Knowing we were celebrating an anniversary, we were even given a complimentary and nicely decorated dessert complete with candle - very nice surprise :-)Overall, thank you to the entire staff and I must congratulate the management responsible for such an awesome team. Lastly, a big shout out to Jong who looked after us throughout - very attentive and super helpful and helped make this the best dining experience in Singapore i've had in a very long while
5
The location is perfect. We took an MRT direct from tampines stn to City Hall. So convenient. It's excellent food especially the tenderloin beef. We enjoy the evening with the red wine.
4
Food was great as always especially the Festive Menu this year. Love the ambience. Love the service.
3
Good location, food is nice.
Specially bread and olive oil with balsamic.
Tiramisu was wonderful!
Set menu is reasonable.
4
This restaurant at the Fairmont Singapore is good. The service is good. Food selection is good. Reasonably priced and very accessible if you are staying at Fairmont or Raffles Hotel
5
Great food. Love the truffle fries, waffles coffee and keylime pie. They even have baby chair for a friend': toddler. Will definitely go back again!
4
Prego has been around for more than 20 yrs and consistently serve up great food. A small glitch however was a reminder that the core group of service staff had changed over the years: we now need to actively and visibly seek for service and the usual serving of bread at the start of the meal was missing until the staff was reminded
5
We were looking for a quick dinner for two very tired people. The service was excellent, as was the menu choices. Sally looked after us. This is very accessible from the Swissotel Stamford or the Fairmont, you can get there via the MRT. The food was full of flavour, in particular the lasagne was so good we went back a second time for another serving of the hospitality and good food. Prices were comparable to other restaurants of this quality
5
Breakfast is the most important meal , right ? When you enter Prego , you have a vast variety of food to chose from . Our stay became more enjoyable because of kick start of the day . Thank you team for making it a lovely memory .
1
We stopped in for a pizza ... VERY disappointed! first the pizza, which was nothing special ( after taxes ) cost $40 ... It arrived under cooked ...then we went through a song and dance with the manager about getting done properly ... which involved them taking off the mozarella ..which changed the pizza we ordered ... !!! Also, they sneakily charged us $12 for water again! Eventually the water charge was 'commuted to $7 ... Holy drought Batman! Shameful
4
We didn't book lunch in advance but being guests at the Fairmont, Preto managed to provide us with a table for our Christmas Day Lunch. The food was excellent with choices ranging from oysters, prawns, crab and Italian hams, through to cuts of turkey, prime rib and Italian favourites such as lasagne, pizza and more. Free flowing drinks made it a lunch to remember and the staff here were prompt and polite in serving and clearing tables
4
This restaurant has been around forever! Great place for semi casual Italian food in Singapore! Food is great and ambience is perfect.
4
Great and friendly service staff. Professional too. However price is a little steep, not so value for money.
5
Stayed in fairmont for a week and was having breakfast regularly at Prego. They have such an amazing breakfast menu covering almost all cuisines
5
Lunch was good n ambient was inviting. Service was prompt n passionate. Nice n great, simply awesome
4
Good services, good foods and ambiance.
They have AMEX card promotion for all the foods by 50%.
Everything was fine, execpt the portion.. a bit too little for me..
4
Pizza and pasta have always been great! However, I preferred the older menu where the seafood wasn't fried!
4
This place is located at Raffles City. There are quite a lot of seats for bigger groups. They have set lunches at S$49++ which comes with a choice of appetiser, main course (pasta) n a dessert. Or one can go for the pizza which is big enough to be divided into 8 slices. The food here is nice and service is not bad. Nice place for gathering with friends and colleagues
3
When we arrived on a Monday night, the whole restaurant was boisterious and noisy. The aircon was not working well hence the place was very stuffy. We had to raise our voices in order to hear one another. The waitress ( caucasian lady with black hair) who served our table had a sour look on her face the whole time after we did not order any wine. She only served us water after the food was served and only upon our second request. I noticed that all the other tables had a bottle of water on the table except ours. She also did not bother to refill our water at all despite the empty glasses and was in a hurry to clear our plates when we had just finished. We quickly adjourned to another place soon after. For a upmarket place like Prego, we were sorely disappointed with the ambience, service and ventilation. The food was its only saving grace
5
Quality of food, ambience, pricing, service are all excellent.....maybe if I really have to picked on something...I would say they could have increase their staff strength alittle, as I felt at certain peak timing....everyone seems to be too busy to attend to you. But overall, its really a nice place that doesn't need to burn a hole in your wallet.
2
Honestly I was not craving for Italian food but being nearby I thought to visit this bespoken restaurant.I'll be sharp: Ridiculous starter portion, the thinner no the thinnest cold cuts I ever see - oh, aside that prosciutto (I think it is, since no waiter explaining what's on the dish) I never see before those kind of cold cuts unless we're talking about a good breakfast selection. Secondly, really?? parmesan cheese is your "selection" along with the cold cuts? To end with the cheap afternoon tea gallette presented as crackers ..... 16S$ the cost!Linguine with clams were just OK, even though floating on a brownish stock flavored by fresh chilli roughly chopped, I guess the giant and cheap-just-burning one as plenty of skin parcels. I did ask for "al dente" and after 8 or 9 minutes the pasta landed on my table thoroughly cooked although not overcooked: means it was precooked indeed. Thanks for asking if I wish to have parmesan on top, but fish and cheese aren't a gourmand match at all!!!! Bread basket served with ricotta-truffle very nice, I would say the best part of a dinner ending with the most watery and disgusting espresso I ever try (in a reputable 5* hotel). No one bothered to offer any dessert - time to close as its late already
5
Prego has excellent service and top quality food. Typical italian dishes and a good wine list with several wines offered also by the glass. Restaurant is modern in design and with a pleasant lay-out.
3
Standard has dropped abit though, but still fairly acceptable. Their Tiramisu is still one of the better ones.
3
Prego today is so unlike Prego yesterday. Food quality has changed and so has prices which is really on the high side.
4
This breakfast came with our stay at The Fairmont hotel which is attached, never seen such a comprehensive spread. If you like a big breakfast this place is for you. Service was very good too
5
Hearty Italian food, perfect for business lunch. High ceiling and casual atmosphere, good enough table-to-table distance. Recommends pasta as they are handmade and very authentic.
4
We had a wonderful time at Prego. Service was excellent. Price was reasonable and food was delicious.
4
Love the Prego pizza and the pescarato pasta. The calamari is really good
Can give the caramalised apples a miss.
2
We ended up paying $75 for 2 people having 2 glasses of wine and 2 pastas. It was a total ripoff for an experience that was worse than that in a diner. When we arrived without reservation at about 7.30pm, we were told there is a 45 min wait. We could see many empty tables that were dirty and had not been cleaned. We arrived in 45 mins to find that the place was practically empty but with dirty tables all around. After we were seated, we had to catch the attention of some one to place our orders. The food was underwhelming to say the least. And then the sticker shock which of course includes the ubiquitous 10% service charge that has become almost mandatory across Singapore. Avoid this place
5
We stayed at the Fairmont Singapore which was the best choice by far and we had a choice of 2 restaurants for breakfast, one being Prego. OMG that's all l can say do yourself a favour and go to Prego every morning not that our other choice was not good, it was but on a smaller scale. Straight down the lift through the hotel door and straight into Prego, just too convenient. My hubby and l are foodies let's face it most of us are and when we travel we make a point of having a great and filling breaky to see us through to dinner at night. Upon arriving at Prego we were greeted by a very nice host and hostess who escorted us to our table quickly. On our first morning my eyes were popping as l looked around at the abundance of food choices on offer. You name it, it was there. The choice of food especially catering for all nationalities was wonderful and it gave us the chance to try new cuisines. Coffee piping hot and juices icy cold. To list everything would be overwhelming so check out Prego's website. If you like variety and good food and all you can eat and great service then don't miss out on Prego you will regret it if you do. As we only ate breakfast at Prego l cannot review the lunch and dinner menu however l cannot believe it would not be as great as breakfast. Looking forward to eating dinner at Prego next time we are in Singapore as well as breaky, l just regret not taking photos.Yum Yum fellow travellers!!
4
The overall experience was split, breakfast service and options were exceptional, one of the biggest breakfast options I have seen in a hotel before. 10/10... We dined in Prego only once for dinner and it was a little off. Service was a little scattered even though restaurant was less than half full when we dined. Menu options were a little limited but decently priced. After we finished our meals no one came back to clear our table or to offer dessert or coffee. After a considerable wait time we got up to leave as we were heading to the casino and no one seemed in a rush to come back to us. We were hastily stopped in our tracks as we were about to leave, almost like they thought we were doing a "runner" I had already given my room number before we dined. We were left standing in the restaurant for nearly five minutes as they prepared the bill, signed it and then while we waited, standing there, they went to double check out room number before letting us move on. That did make for an awkward end to dinner but definitely didn't tarnish our overall experience at the Fairmont Hotel which was exceptional. On a big plus was the Carbonara was one of the best my friend had ever had
4
We always visit the Prego every time we are in Singapore as it is literally across the road from our hotel. It has a very good Italian menu. The restaurant, sited in Raffles Mall is in a good area for shopping etc.
4
Portion of food get lesser and lesser. Calamari not fresh and so small, different from the last time. Family will order this dish whenever we are there. Pls improve on this dish as I noticed many ppl will order this appetisers
5
A great restaurant for family, couples or business . Great service , be sure to make reservations!
Great set menus and good value for money. Extensive wine list.
5
We only had breakfast at Prego, and if that was anything to go by the choice of food was excellent, as were the choice of juices, tea/coffee etc. Love the Italian feel to this place, it was just a little touch of Italy in Singapore.
5
As with all our trips to Singapore we had to return to Prego's for our Italian fix and we have never been disappointed. The food, staff and ambience were all perfect. Can recommend the pasta dishes as the flavours are great. Give it a go I believe the pizza to be fantastic, I can say that they look good. Please enjoy
5
Need a generous helping of vegetable korma to start your day? An array of French cheeses? Waffles? Dumplings? High-test coffee? It's all here at Prego, one of the best breakfast buffets I've had in Singapore â€” and Singapore has no shortage of excellent breakfast buffets. Delicious
5
We returned to Prego after a long absence. We were surprised that it was full on a Wed evening. We were warmly received and seated within 10mins. The service staff were as knowledgeable, attentive and friendly as before. Despite the capacity crowd, everything worked smoothly. Our apetizers arrived in 11 mins and each subsequent course was served at a smooth, even pace. It's truffle season and the truffle dishes were excellent. My truffle risoto with pigeon breast was done to perfection, with just the right amount of black truffle shavings. The squid ink pasta is not to be missed; you won't find it done any better in this city. Prices have increased in tandem with dining out prices in Singapore, and I consider their prices fair for the quality and service provided. Overall, it was another satisfying experience for us. We'll be returning soon to try more truffle dishes before the season ends. Prego

Prego has changed their policy and now do not provide free water for diners. I have a policy of not patronizing restaurants that do not provide free water. Also, consistency in the cooking is not there, patronized twice this week (because I already had appointment made in advance, otherwise will not return due to no free water provided, ordered the same dish and both tasted different
5
Atmosphere is casual but quiet enough for a intimate family gathering. I would recommend the lamb chop with truffle & bone marrow sauce. The rib eye is great too. They gave my son a complimentary slice of cake as it was his birthday - I thought the restaurant could have given a larger slice !
3
A nice restaurant , food is good at least what we ate.Service is lacking...thanx to our labour crunch. Which is also related to training and consistency.We were sited by a Filipino guy , we advice us on choice of menu and took our order. Being italian restaurant...the table had olive oil and balsamic vinegar. ...Are you not suppose to serve the breads. This didn't happen......a matter of training and consistency.ignorance is when the order taker ,should send the bread immediately after placing our order....this can be improved!We waited for our 1st order...which is Parma Ham with rock melon...came in 10 min and the bread is forgotten.Queried the Italian Manager on shift , he apologized..,thus we didn't wanna create a fuss...indeed a great evening despite the hiccup
2
We were there for a family dinner. Was seated at the far end if the restaurant. It was warm and stuffy I must say. The tables at the front are much cooler. Previously table water was complimentary now must pay $3 for water!

The negative however is that they no longer serve free water. Having to pay for water somehow detracts from the enjoyment of the meal, especially for those who are not into wines.

Stopped in Prego for dinner after a day at Raffles City, the service was rushed and poor. And the food was extremely average at best. We ordered the anti pasta cold ,eats and cheese. The meat selection was ok but the cheese very poor. Scallops were frozen and way too chewy. Eggplant was just buried in tomato sauce. 4/10$135 sing for 2 with one glass of red each for a below average Italian meal did not bring value . Not recommended if you like good food and service.
4
Prego has been around a long time and till this day, remains on the expensive side (catering to the tourist crowd?). However, food is really quite good and so is service (I guess even though it's styled as a casual restaurant, it provides fine dining service at fine dining prices). Go if you are on company account or having a celebration. Otherwise, there's plenty of good, affordable food in the basement of the building
4
We had cheese platter and calamari as appetizer. Calamari is acceptable if more crispy will b better. Lamb chop is perfect as we requested for well done. The charred fragrance add flavour to this dish together with the rosemary sauce n sautÃ©ed mushroom. Pizza has the authentic taste. We ordered the Prego.
4
Prego is been around for a long time, located in Raffles City complex between the Swissotel and the Fairmount. The food here is average, it is par with most mid-range Italian restaurants in Singapore. The food prices aren't unreasonable, big plus for the pasta dishes and wood fired pizza and Interesting antipasti choice, and of course great wines selection. Food is Very well presented and nice portions too. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I have been here several times and didn't have a bad meal once. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. I truly recommend this place. I will be back

We felt welcomed to the seatings, from taking order to serving to dinning, somehow the services was excellent that evening. We had very nicely cooked lamb chop with rosemary, delicious and generous toppings on pizza and my partner ended with fresh draft beer while i had lovely cuppuccino. The started however was too salty for the olives, didnt taste homemade and the sundried tomatoes were ordinary, I have had better tasted ones. Nevertheless we will come again for the good experiences
5
Having lived in Italy for 4 years I appreciated Chef Antonio's talent in the kitchen. The food was impeccable. The best Italian food I had outside of Italy. The veal chop was cooked so beautifully - just spot on. The prawn carpaccio was another highlight - so delicate flavours. Risotto with roasted pigeon perfect texture and taste. Gnocchi with hazelnuts and duck ragout autumn flavours reminding me that in Europe the season has changed (unlike Singapore where it is 33 degrees all year around). Service was attentive (although the restaurant was full). The service was always there when you needed it. Great dining experience! Hurry there while the truffle menu is there.. it is definitely a must
5
I reached at 10pm to make it before their last order at 1030pm. Tried the Dinner set for $69, and the portions of salad, pasta, and main course were smaller than ala carte ones. U get a variety, however, without large portions of each. Their pasta & pizza were impeccably done, as always..
4
Enroute to theatre, decided to give this recent new menu a go. Pleasantly surprised, wonderful selection presented along the entire length of this bright sunny restaurant . Big plus : lots of space, no snaking queues. Surprised my Ocbc credit card gave me 25% off the S$98 buffetNice: beef carpaccio in truffle oil, huge round of fresh mozzarella cheese at salad bar, creamy mushroom risotto to die for. My kids said the carbonara was great. I Adored the grilled eggplant. Gorgeous cheese selection, of course! Less nice: Canadian oysters were thin, tasteless. King crab has frozen and mushy. Give the beef steak a miss, stringy. Didn't have space to try the lamb chops which looked thick and succulent. Liked the concept and staff were lovely and attentive even though buffet style. (Don't you hate it if your empty plates pile up? )Will be back without the car so we can try the free flow of wines and beer next time.
3
Unlike my previous visit I was disappointed with the food this time. The pasta pescatora was very average and pricey! The whole meal including three lamb chops, four sticks of asparagus plus potatoes. a glass of white wine and beer cost over S$180.
4
Been here numerous times and it always never fails to disappoint. Food is consistently good! Best place for gatherings and to enjoy a good meal.
4
The local is central, ambience was ideal for dinner with family and friends. Quality italian food. Plan your meal if you are not ordering the set menu, great variety and aave some space for dessert, their tiramisu is really good!
4
Great quality food at value for money prices with the far card promo. Service and ambience was excellent.
3
Food not too bad but presentation needs improvement . Service - so so... Atmosphere too noisy , hard time to talk.
1
Service was poor. Had to constantly call waiter for service. Food was below average certainly as compared to previous visits. Steak cooking preference was not met despite trying to be very clear on this. For what it is not cheap and most certainly our last visit
3
For an Italian restaurant, the pizza was horrid. Have eaten much better Woodfire oven pizzas all over the world. This didn't taste great at all. Ordered a chicken breast dish with fries which was nice. The spaghetti pomodoro for my 3 year old was super tasty.It was the place where we ate breakfast everyday (living in Fairmont) - which was awesome. For dinner, I think improvement is required. But the place was packed
4
Prego has its ups and downs over the past decade with changes in management and chefs. It has regained its stability in terms of food quality and client loyalty. In recent years. But then, it is still far from its former glory as the management has lost its more flamboyant Italian character. In terms of service, it depends on which station you are seated, as there are noticeable differences, and therefore the few disappointments at times
1
They have changed the menu !And taste :(We order seabass & Parma ham pizza. Seabass was my favorite before, with different recipe of cooking than this new one. I won't order it again. Bit the quality of the fish is good.The pizza is not bad. Very disappointing besides the seabass is they stop making zucotto, their best desert list in the previous menu. Anyway, now it makes me feeling too expensive going dining there for the food.
2
I remember many years ago since Prego started, they had good food and good quality.Had dinner recently and hmmm, ahicked to see the pricing as expensive as some good restaurants at some hotels; And the food quality was, well, not what it used to be.I had a steak and it's the 2nd steak I had this past week- and this steak at Prego, it had a weird taste and texture. The texture was very rubbery- not the leathery of say an overdone steak, tho I ordered medium-well. And the taste, well... I've tasted better steaks!And the dessert, a 'chocolate bomba', which as the waitress did say, had nothing to do with much chocolate, other than a mint-type ice cream coated with chocolate. Can't say I was not Pre-warned but yet, the texture of the ice cream was also rubbery and weird in texture... powdery? Someone please remind me not to go back - CMI.

Sunday buffet at a great level
Very good and friendly service.
they offer is so good that within three hours, I could not taste half the products offered
3
Lunch is a good deal only with 1-1 credit card deal. Varied choice for set lunch and + $10 for a glass of wine
4
Prego always so willing to please - we had a steak and pizza but changed the sides for the steak to brocolli since I don't take onions and added chicken to a tomato based pizza. Pretty yum 😊
4
Consistency and maintaining food quality have met my expectations of Prego's.
I'd believe a business lunch combo menu would be a welcomed option.
4
Food at Prego is of good standard. The complimentary bread is nice and comes in generous portion. Service is attentive.
5
I've been coming to Prego since the early 90s. To me, it just seems to get better and better. I recently dined there during the Sunday lunch buffet - incredible! Surely it is the nicest Italian buffet in town! (With gluten free pasta and bread available.) And for those who are not driving, there is a free flow of sparkling wines etc. This is not a buffet for a quick lunch - you will want to come for a leisurely gastronomic experience! Enjoy! Also, they are having early dinner specials for only $30 every afternoon from 5 or 5:30pm.
5
The restaurant is located in the Fairmont Hotel in Raffles City, also easily accessible from the Swissotel and the mall itself. The ambiance is that of a cosy Italian Restaurant and the food is excellent. We were there for dinner and the restaurant offers a wide choice of mainly Italian dishes. Our food were quickly served and was to say the least, excellent
4
In all honesty, I only came for breakfast and had not had the chance to sample some of the more unique dishes that is supposedly Italian. I must say though that despite that one time in this restaurant, the selection was rather good. It lacked local variety but in general the Western breakfast selection was quite good, and of good quality food.IN terms of the set up, the restaurant was quite well designed and the table arrangements despite being rather tight, had good spacing for their patrons to enjoy a good meal. The ambiance was also cosy and the service was quite good.They interior decoration was quite unique and pleasing for me, and I am sure it would fit well for many people to enjoy a good dinner, even a romantic one.I wished I could have come to this restaurant to sample their Italian selections, either for lunch or breakfast as the kitchen for this restaurant looks very interesting. The smell was rather good, reflecting that the meals would have been better. I might just drop by some day when I am in town agai
4
We ordered the risotto and set dinner and the special of the day was a delicious beef stew. Other courses that came with the set included melon and parma ham, a pasta and tiramisu for dessert. The food was lovely and the service was attentive. A delightful experience, all in
5
Charming place, especially at night. You could request a table by the windows, and look out onto Beach road while you dine. The food is good, and the menu offers a decent selection. If you return to this restaurant often, you would struggle to find a new item to try. They do offer a seasonal menu from time to time.The servers are attentive and offer warm friendly service. Restaurant is always full - so it would be good to have a reservation in advance
3
All day dining restaurant at the Fairmont Singapore. Decent breakfast but so annoying both mornings we had breakfast here, we had to look for someone to let us have coffee three times. More awake restaurant staff required!
5
Fuss free, unpretentious and simply delicious! This is how pasta should be, perfectly cooked and coated with just enough well balanced sauce.
4
The buffet looks like a US buffet meets a European buffet meets and Asian buffet. Something for everyone. Nicely laid out with attentive service. I always look forward to breakfast when I stay at the Fairmont.
5
This Italian restaurant has been around for the longest time and they have been consistently good. Many years ago, I had my first taste of calamari here and I still think it is good. Also love their bread basket. Good pizzas and pasta here.
4
The food is consistently good. I ordered the tomato salad which is my all time favourite and it is good.
4
It's the normal hotel buffet breakfast but with so much more, especially the Asian offerings. Yes, you can have the eggs cooked to order but you can also have (depending on the day) rote or chicken curry or noodles or wonton soup or porridge.
5
Visit the Prego in Singapore and experience the best breakfast ever. Not to be missed. Staff and food the best ever
2
We dined here with high expectations as the Fairmont is such a lovely Hotel, but unfortunately we disagree with this restaurant the quality of food is not very good and it is way overpriced for what you get. Needs a lot more refining both in quality and pricing as well as service. Wouldn't recommend it
5
If you are looking for cozy and friendly Italian brunch during Sunday, this is the best option for you. The restaurant is children friendly. My kid and I had a great time in this sneak preview. I was too busy to take photo during the 3 hours brunch. Great food, wonderful drinks, fantastics service.
3
First of all, the atmosphere is very nice with a large crowd, something I had not expected. For a Wednesday evening, waw, I don't know that many places in Singapore that can show that. The staff is very helpful, the wine is good and some of the food is good. You can go for set lunch or dinner, but to me the price advantage would only have been 4SGD, so we decided to go Ã  la carte (4-course set dinner is 69sgd++). The calamari fritti was disappointing as it was served like in just any other place. Taste also not differentiating. The pasta my wife had with seafood was very good, the best dish of the evening. And that portion was huge. I think it's almost impossible to eat that with a set menu as this dish alone will fill your stomach. So good points there. Then a parma prosciuotto pizza which was slightly disappointing. This is because there are so many good Italians in Singapore where pizza is excellent and this just wasn't up to that competition. We didn't even finish it completely. Wines were fine at 18sgd++ on average per glass. So we left with a full stomach, but the food was much less refined than we had expected. So sorry because we had higher expectations based on the many good reviews. Probably won't go there again, although we might be tempted to give it one more try but with a buffet then
5
We enjoyed our meal at this restaurant the food was excellent and the service very good. The ambience and the decor is also very good. I personally recommend people visiting singappore to try a meal here.
4
Good food, light but also very Italian, excellent service and smiling staff, and not expensive. Well worth a stop
5
waitresses were attentive to the needs of my 2 year old boy, providing kids cutlery and utensils. They were even attentive to quickly replace cutlery when my boy dropped his on the floor.
4
My third time at Prego (this time with my colleagues) and I'm still loving the food here!
The carbonara was good but the crabmeat pasta was awesome (must try)! The pizzas are quite decent too!
Will be back for a fourth time for sure.
5
The pasta and pizza are nice and tasty. The staff was able to make recommendations for the pasta and the desserts to go with; and explained why certain desserts are recommended. Refill of water was also quick!
4
Prego's is good value for Italian.The crabmeat fusilli with asparagus and sun-dried tomato in light cream sauce and the lobster linguine in tomato sauce were both under $40. They were both good but not excellent. Tasty but lacked refinement.The scallops with morels on polenta were quite delicious.The two chef's special desserts tiramisu and chocolate tartlet were excellent
4
The restaurant looks the same as when I first went there over 20 years ago. The menu seems the same - pasta, pizza, antipasta etc. The food is consistently good but not fabulous. Service is good and a quiet atmosphere to have a conversation without raising our volume. Comparing the prices to that in SF, I prefer to stick to the local cuisine of Singapore
4
I ate at Prego a few times while staying at the Fairmont. The breakfast buffet (included in my stay) was truly excellent. The orange butter cream with the pancakes is my tip! All tastes are catered for. I also had dinner, taking advantage of the early bird special (5-6). This is 18 dollars for a two course meal from a small selection of soups and pastas, including bread. Drinks not included. I found the staff to be friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere pleasant
4
On Sept 8 my Wife and I went to Pergo for the first time. We booked the place through Chope. I loved the interior ambience which was bright, beautifully decorated and cosy. The quality of the food served in Italian style met our expectation. We were well served by the courteous staff who provided advice and some light conversation
5
Prego is by no means cheap, but you're paying for really great quality Italian mains and a good spread of other dishes such as fresh sashimi, salads, and cheeses. I came for the Sunday brunch buffet and their pastas were great - I highly recommend ordering their mains to share so that you don't waste any food and you get to eat more. My friend had the champagne/wine buffet so she topped up more money to enjoy her brunch with free-flow alcohol, which would be worth it if you're a huge alcohol fan like her.
2
Price of meal was absurdly high and on top of that, the meal was barely satisfactory. The only saving grace was its friendly staff. Would not recommend spending money here...
3
A very average experience overall. Ordered Parma ham/rock melon appetiser, a seafood tomato based pasta and one of their chef-hat pastas. Nothing outstanding.
There was a time when Prego served much better food.
5
First of all, the booking system is fantastic, I did it online. Both food and services were great. With the set meal option, we got to try different kinds of foot at 1 fixed price.
4
try the special menu $18 2 choices before 6pm and very good value and great food.right next to the door to the shops ...
4
There was a wide variety of food and staff were all very thoughtful and courteous. The broad selection for breakfast is good enough for people of various cultural backgrounds. Although I didn't always have time for breakfast, what I remember best are the staff and their great service. This will be one of the main reasons why I will remember this restaurant with fondness. The staff showed warmth and courtesy in serving their guests.
4
Prego is quite a huge restaurant - I was there for their Sunday lunch buffet. They have a wide spread of mains/sides/fruits/desserts but unlike the usual buffet display, half of the items available through an order form. Initially, I thought it was quite a hassle to keep ordering. However, I changed my mind after that. The food was freshly prepared and it was all hot and nice. I really enjoyed my meal there
4
Prego serves reliably good food and apart from the the usual antipasti, pastas, main courses and desserts, there is also a set dinner dinner option (comprising antipasti, pasta, meat course and dessert) where the meat course varies from day to day. If you have an Amex Platinum card and there are 2 diners and you order at least 2 main courses, you enjoy 50% off, which brings down the cost of a meal there to a very affordable level. Tip: If there are 2 diners, just one set meal and a selection of another main course will be more than enough. Especially since the restaurant provides a generous serving of bread served with a delicious garlic-tomato paste in a jar at the beginning of the meal
3
As before, the bread was a foretaste of what is to come; food that met our expectations. I had the rib-eye whilst my wife had the fish. Both dishes was good. What marred the experience was the service. The servers were polite and helpful but it seems that the restaurant is understaffed. It took quite a bit of effort to get butter, water refills and even the bill
3
It is amazing what a difference it makes whether you are sitting at the "correct" section of the restaurant. I had been at Prego quite a few times and some of the servers are horrifying and others are friendly. Try to seated at the first section near to the entrance and get service by the pinoys or chinos
2
Servers were attentive, but the food was just average for the price tag. Nothing wowed us. The pasta in the Mushroom Fetuccini was way too soft.
5
Utilised Prego for it's fantastic buffet breakfast while staying at the Fairmont. The selection is huge with good quality.
4
Impressed by the efficiency and quality of service.
Interesting antipasti choice giving a feeling of Italy yet being that far away. Great products.
Great pizza with slim crusty crust yet not dry. One of the best I had.
Good wines too.
3
The good: Great International Buffet Breakfast and if you leave hungry, it's your own fault. The cost per person is $$$$, but if you come for the buffet, you can more than eat enough to offset the cost.The Bad: There are many wonderful Italian restaurants within a short walking distance of the Fairmont for dinner and unfortunately, Prego appears to no longer be one of them. In short, my appetizer of Eggplant Parmesan was all Cheese, overpowering small bites of Eggplant. And, my Angel Hair, Maine Lobster, Sweet Chili, Onion in a tomato basil Sauce pasta course contained two tiny bites of Lobster and was so very spicy, I could not eat it. When I looked for my waiter for a replacement, he was no where to be found and the restaurant was only 1/3 full. I finally asked for a check, signed the bill because I was a guest of the hotel and as I was preparing to leave, was told the system was down and I needed to pay with a credit card. I give this restaurant a Three for the breakfast, but a ONE for dinner simply because the Italian beer and wine were very good and I should have passed on the expensive choices that I did not or could not eat!! I highly recommend Garibaldi's on Purvis, Ristorante Amarone on Robinson Road or Basilico inside the Regent Singapore Hotel if you would like a properly prepared Italian meal.. Cia
4
Food, bread, house cheese, tomato purÃ©e, so delicious n freshly made in house! U can taste the ingredients in spoilt by anything else. Never a disappointment every time
5
I had buffet breakfast here every day for a week plus. The food was excellent, there were plenty of choices and the staff was terrific. Great place
4
Comfort food that I will return to repeatedly whenever I visit town. My favourite is always pasta as the ingredients used are very fresh. The house wines are also well selected and reasonably priced.
4
This is one of my favorite Italian restaurant which will frequent with my hubby and children. When my foreign friends are here in Singapore, I will also bring them to this place for a sumptuous meal in a great ambience and good service. The food are still as good as before however the appetizer (focaccia with cream n olives) is no longer as tasty as it was in the past where they will served guests with one mini loaf warm white bread with tomato salsa n butter / olives on top of ricotta cheese.The service crew's services are still great but probably when it full house, it will take awhile to catch their attention for services.It would be great if they will serve dine in guest with the warm bread and tomato salsa or olives with cream cheese again as it is a good thing to begin with before the main course starts. In the past, they also used to served a dish which is the pork knuckle but it is no longer available. It was the best pork knuckle, I had ever tasted in a Singapore restaurant.
2
We had a dinner planned few days back. Few observations.1. The breads are not fresh any more. Cold not so great.2. Service very slow. You have to wait for 10 min min for some one to respond to your request.3. You ask bread you will get in 15 to 20 min.4. You order drinks you will get in 20 to 25 min.5. The Aircon not working. If we complain the attitude is pathetic.6. We asked for Chillioil looks like they dont even know what is chilli oil. The guy told us to mix olive oil and chilliflakes.Are we paying such premium price for this service. I hope not to visit this place agai
4
I started visiting this place after I've gotten my amex platinum visa which allows me 50% off for myself + 1 diner (up to 5diners on Mondays!) and it has been good so far!Staff are super efficient and friendly, and knowledgeable too.Portions are huge by Asian standards, except for the cheese platter which shrunk in size after my first visit. Oh well. Still a good deal anyway with the amex discount.Worth a visit :)
3
The bread was served at room temp. The server said they no longer(?) serve them warm but did accede to our request. Set dinner a value for money option, overall food quality was good. Service was slow and difficult to get staff attention. The mojito cocktail we ordered was disastrous, weak, no crush ice & mint leaves. As good as a badly concocted lime cordial
4
Good place for casual dinner with family and friends. Attentive service and comfortable setting for even young kids.
5
Decided to dine at Prego since we have not been there for ages.Saw a sign for Set Dinner at $69 per person.The Set Dinner comprises of choice of appetiser, choice of pasta, a fixed daily special and choice of dessert.We both ordered the Parma Ham with Melon for starters and Pescatora for the pasta. My wife had the Tiramisu for dessert and I opted for the Caramelised Apple. The daily special was roast pork belly.The food was, as usual, delicious but what surprised me was the portion; it was not small! We were served by a wait staff, Swan, who was two months in the job. What she lacked in product knowledge, she made up for it by making the effort to find out what we asked of her and came back with the correct answers. She was also cheery, pleasant and enthusiastic on the job despite her sore throat.Overall, a pleasant dining experience that we come to expect from Prego
5
Imaginative variety for every taste, be an Asian, European or American; you will never get a feeling of of monotony. Every food is well prepared and presented
3
We dined at 8 pm but the restaurant was still filled so it was difficult getting attention. Being seated amongst families resulted in a noisy dining experience. Food was as expected for the price bracket.
5
Buffet style, varied food choices, food changes daily. Cuisines ranged from Asian, Indian, Western. Chilled choices included smoked and cured fish. A great selection of pastries, muffins and steamed buns and a gluten-free station. Fresh juice options eg spinach/green grape/cucumber and apple or a banana smoothie and these changed daily. Good for couples, families and business people. Welcoming and efficient service. Weekend mornings are busier so be prepared for that.
3
Was having dinner with few friends on Saturday night. Food is nice, especially the rib eye and cod fish. Service is a bit slow probably due to the shortage of manpower, but attentive. If you are OCBC card holders, you are entitled for 30% off your bill till end of August. The set meal is quite worth
4
Visited Prego for breakfast on 1 occasion. Great selection of breakfast foods and service was excellent. Will visit again
4
Good Italian food, late at night. Reasonable prices but a bit lacking in ambience. Lovely staff, keen to please
5
Have a lot of options for breakfast from western to local cuisines. The crew are all friendly and helpful, especially to Rio
3
The food here is above average. Sunday brunch is of good value. Service depends... If they are fully staffed, it is good... If not, can be a little slow
4
Prego offers solid reliable Italian fare. Ambience is pleasant and service was pretty standard. We had a pleasant evening with family. Located conveniently in the Fairmont hotel at Raffles City, a major MRT stop in the city.
4
Went there twice this week, enjoyed a lot. Their pasta is all handmade and very hearty. Nothing very creative but very back-to-basic.
3
Chose this place thinking that being Italian the coffee would be good. We were wrong. The food was quite nice but overpriced. Wouldn't eat there again.
4
Prego is extremely busy and yes sometimes you need to wait for a table, but its worth the wait. The juices and omelette are great. The service with coffee is fast. Its not he biggest variety but has ample for all tastes..
2
I frequent Prego quite a lot, not because the food is nice, but because I've got a far card membership which entitles me 50%. Prego has been around since I was a kid and I remembered the food at Prego 15 years ago was stunning, they provided one whole round loaf of onion bread for each table, the food than was outstanding, however the standards has been dropping and dropping and dropping. If you do not have 50% don't bother going, you can get better food at cheaper price
4
I've had a good impression of the food and service and Prego and this is my umpteen times dining there. Im here with the American Express Platinum card which gives the benefit of a FAR card and my food items were 50% off. So definitely a good deal at a great price
3
30 July 2016; just back home in Singapore from a dinner for 2 in Prego. We have been visiting this restaurant for 20 years and have noted the decline in the service standard over these years. Tonight must be one of the worst visits ever: slow, no, poor service: evereytime we wanted attention it took the lack of staff, a very long time to react. This is clearly the issue now; there are clearly way too few staff to supply an acceptable level of service when the restaurant is busy as it was tonight. There were tables vacated by patrons that remained uncleared for 30 minutes while we were finishing our meal. One waiter arrived to clear, looked at the table then just walked away and left the table in our full view in its disgusting mess. I spoke to the girl on reception as we left and told her how poor the clearing service was; she said she would report it and make sure it was improved. Yea right, no faith in that response. So in summary, acceptable food, poor service, disgraceful, nay, disgusting lack of clearing service. WAKE UP PREGO MANAGEMENT....do you care
5
This is my favorite Italian restaurant. We always come here for its excellent pastas and pizzas! Even the breads they serve complementary before the meal goes very well with olive oil. Its fried calamari are very succulent and big, while the tiramisu is an excellent choice for dessert
3
Service was good and food was nice, however it was a little noisy in the restaurant. When i wanted to pay for the bill, the waitress was kind enough to tell me that there was a 20% discount for OCBC credit card, otherwise I would have pay using other cards
4
I had breakfast at Prego during my stay at Fairmont Hotel. The place were actually nice although can be a bit overcrowded in the morning. The variety of food was fantastic, their nasi lemak with ikan bilis and fried chicken was just so good, I ate that everyday. Their waffles are crispy and the topping options was just lovely. A lot of fruit options, cheese and yoghurt. Their coffee taste really good. For moslem, this place serve pork although there's a lot of non pork choices. Overall, happy tummy eating here everyday
4
Pleasant place to feast & fellowship on a Sunday with Family. Varieties and quality of food was good. Must try.....
3
For the price we paid, although the food was decent, the service left much to be desired.
Waiter was ill trained and kept making mistakes. He looked like a school boy who didn't know how to place the cutlery.
3
We had a very good waiter who made good recommendations. The caprese salad was great but the new seafood pizza was a far cry from the garlic prawns pizza they used to have.
5
an awesome experience and the food is great. will revisit again and try out the other amazing food they have.
4
Prego have a variety of Italian food, which is delicious & tasty. If you like Italian food, you will love this place.
4
Service is good and attentive.4 course course dinner set which is value for money at around $90. The tiramisu dessert taste nice
3
We ate at Prego one night as it is connected to the Fairmont, where we were staying. For Singapore being a food mecca, this place needs to figure out who their clientele is. Iced tea is not lemon water over ice. Chicken Parm isn't even on the menu. When asked if they could prepare it, as they had Eggplant Parm on the app menu, I was told that they pre-prepare the eggplant part and could not accommodate. I opted for lasagna. It was fine, but nothing that would even score a 4/5. The complimentary bread was okay, but nothing great. For the cost of the meal, it was underwhelming and a disappointment. I would go outside and enjoy Italian food somewhere else
4
The service at Prego was excellent from the start to finish. Was taken to our table & offered water (had a choice of bottled still water, sparkling or regular at no charge). Waiter was very attentive to our needs & was very pleasant. Food was good & we had a pleasant afternoon. We took the Set Meal which satisfied us all. Well done Prego
5
One of my favourites and never failed to impress when I invite friends or clients to this restaurant for lunch. the squid ink pasta with tiger prawns or scallops simply to die for. Mud pie and tiramisu simply heavenly. Lasagne portion is generous enough to share for two. don't miss the calamari and parma ham starters, yummy yumm
4
I am amazed by the food selection offered in Prego. I love the fresh green juice they are offering, fruits selection (the red guava was great) and the varieties of the smoked salmon. They also provide western, Chinese and indian food as well. Coffee and pastries are good. The restaurant was always full at the time we were there. The service could be upgraded for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. But i would have no hesitance to come back.
5
awesome Italian restaurant with great food and quality. The location is convenient as well. Highly recommend it!
4
Good food, excellent service, the ambience and a lovely view of the street are 4 reasons to have a meal here.

Food was average, slightly overpriced for the food. And the aircon was not working well in the section we sat.
Only saving grace was the pizza, pretty good! Advice is to sit nearer to the entrance where it is much cooler :)

Prego used to service better pasta during my past visits when I order ala carte.Today we had the semi-buffet with Prosecco at $108++. The buffet was average. You can order from a menu of 40 top choice dishes which is decent but not Prego's regular standard. Portion is small which is good but nothing you will ask for a second serving. Need improvement on the dishes.
3
Staying at the Fairmont and the buffet breakfast was included in room rate. Large breakfast seating area with significant number of food options but for some reason was missing some basic choicesEggs made to order at the station but was unable to add typical options like avocado. Mushroom and tomato as a side to the eggs. Staff were friendly and food quality very good

4th July 2016Brought family this round. We ordered 2 pizzas (8 slices each) - Parma (S$40)and the other is Margherita (S$32). Next a set menu at S$49 - our selection was calamari, mushroom fettuccine and a dessert. Also, a lamb chop with truffle sauce $49. The lamb was exquisitely done, and the truffle sauce was so good! My husband tried once in London and he said it tasted almost the same! The service was above average but could be better. We were there at 12noon with reservation made. Not crowded on a Monday. With family or with friends, Prego is ideal for a cozy meal.

Have been to Prego on a number of occasions. Service this time was exceptionally good. I forgot to ask his name, but the wait staff noticed that I ordered the gluten free pasta, and took the initiative to ask whether I required gluten free bread as well. Food as usual was nice with pleasant ambience

Prego is probably one of Singapore's best established Italian restaurants, set up in a casual Mediterranean style. Pluses: reliable quality, good service, pleasant ambience, prime location, great for a pre-concert meal. Minuses: lots of new competition everywhere, may not be the best value for money, house wines should be better
3
I decided to try this place after 5 years and I still find it average. The food is bland even what was supposed to be the two spiciest dishes on the menu. The service was great at front, but once we sat down I had to nearly tackle a waiter to take out order. It is expensive average Italian food in Singapore. If you want good Italian food try Oso.

Good location, at the entry of Fairmont hotel and Raffles city shopping center. Its a very wellknown restaurant and Always very crowdy, guess when you are with few people you better make a reservation. The staff is friendly and accurate. The food is nice, alot of choices. Price was ok
4
We were lucky to get discount off with OCBC credit card. The lunch set was a pretty good deal too. Ended up paying around 40 per pax after ++. It's pretty crowded during lunch so make sure you make your booking in advance.
5
Location of the restaurant is great, food was served warm and delicious. Service crew was friendly and polite.
5
We are fans of Pregos so every family occasion is celebrated there.
We do wish the previous Foie Gras dish would return to the menu.
5
Had a large of mostly American Breakfast. Asian food is so-so.
But all nicely made. Love the Overnight Oat with Tamarind and pancake.. Waffle was too dry.
5
I recommend their 5-cheese pizza if u love cheese, as they are perfectly mixed and melts in your mouth. Their range of pastas are all well done, but my favorites are the Vongole as well as their Seafood Marinara pasta. I have their steaks medium rare and u get to choose one side and sauce. Get the Platinum Amex card if u love the food her
4
Waiters were polite and efficient to respond to their guests' request. The food selection are many different varieties for different dinners. But, the quality and flavour of food were average not special. The receptionist at the restaurant could be more delightful with smiles to greet the customers in the morning
4
This is a very popular joint, especially on mondays when FAR card members get 50% off the bill. I would go for the ala carte and skip the set dinners. On paper they seem like good value (SGD69++ for starter, pasta, main and dessert) , but in reality the portions are miniaturised tasting portions only. Service was brisk. One thing I didn't yet get to try, their early dinner specials ($20 for starter and pasta if you vacate before 6.30pm) sounds like good value. Would the management care to comment if the portion size is regular or miniature for this promotion
5
Loved this place! Was perfect for our family of five.The menu has a great variety of choices . We had Lots of breads for starters. A shared cheese and meat platter for entree. For mains we were varied from lasagna, pasta with oxtail Ragu, pizza, chicken dish. There was no way we could fit a dessert in as our tummies were overfull which was disappointing as the me use choices looked superbIf you are looking for Italian food when in Singapore highly recommend this place
1
We were at this restaurant 3 years ago and loved it, Returned this year and oh how things have changed. We went for lunch this time. It was so good last time. The choice has been limited. I had ?roast chicken - it was so dry it was so difficult to eat. They charged S$40. My husband had Minestrone soup - very poor. Looked more like a broth with minimal vegetables in. The taste poor too. Will not return
2
I wouldn't said, the evening was spoiled because we had chosen that restaurant for a dinner, bit definitely won't recomend it. The best in this dinner was service and that's all. Crowded and too spacious place, but that's would be fine with nice food, but the food was disappointment! We were really exited to try the cuisine there, but when we got the plates it was like : "what??"/// Portions for pasta were a ok, but for ravioli is so tiny! The price almost 40 sing dollars per 7 ravioli, are you serious?And that would be alright if the taste were fabulous but the cuisine is far from fancy restaurant with fine food
1
The waiter did not come out any suggestion of food, do not explains food we order, what will it be.
When call for bill, it take very long time to setter.
4
Had a business lunch meeting there and was surprised by the quality of food and service hasnt changed since I last visited.
4
the food at Prego's is always good... fresh ingredients and uncomplicated cooking styles to bring out the best in Italian cuisines. Only slight problem was the waiters were really busy all night and attentiveness was somewhat compromised. Our water glasses weren't refilled often enough and we had a bit of trouble catching their attention when we needed something. Having said that, it was still a really enjoyable experience where the atmosphere is casual and relaxed and food was good
5
Have not been back to Prego in many years and decided to bring my daughter there because I remembered wonderful meals there with friends in the past. I must say the quality of food has not waned and I am glad my daughter who is rather discerning of Italian food rated the food here excellent! Will head back soon to try other items in the menu..
5
Prego restaurant is located on the premises of the Fairmont Hotel. As a hotel guest, I highly recommend you choose Prego for their excellent variety of selections. All you would expect from a 5-star selection - eggs to order, pancakes, asian style, fresh fruit smoothies, complimentary newspaper ... Dinner is a real of italian cuisine done with flair! The star are very friendly and helpful in the selections of wine, and which pasta sauce to combine on your palette
2
One of the main course we ordered was medium rare steak. But it was served almost raw. And waitress insisted it was medium rare. Had to send it back to the kitchen. Also I am disturbed that the cutlery was placed directly on the table. I have seen the waitress used the same dry cloth to clean the other tables and then put clean cutlery on the table. It is not hygienic.
4
A bit more expensive than I am generally used to, but there was a nice ambience here and the food was of a good quality. We ordered a pizza and a salad and we're happy with each. Large Italian restaurant, well located and quite busy. Service was adequate, but not really better than that, maybe as restaurant was large and busy
5
Love the pizza at Prego. They do a special one on request, with capers and onions and it is the best comfort food for me. They have many pastas too though I stick to pizza and they have a great selection of cheeses. Recommend the panna-cotta with berry compote!

Prego is located at the first floor of the hotel. The restaurant has a huge dine in area. The restaurant offers Italian cuisine and is quite well known for its authentic Italian family style dishes.Recently there was a credit card 1-for-1 offer for its CHEF'S DINNER SET MENU ($69++) which valid till 17 April 2016. The set meal consisted of choice of Antipasti (Hot and Cold Starters) + Primi Piatti (Pastas & Risotto) + Chef Daily Special + DOLCI (Dessert). I decided to take up this offer.We were showed to a table by the window, which offered a great of the busy street outside.After placing our orders, we were served a box which consisted of 2 kinds of bread and the creamy cheese spread. If one did not like the spread, there was also olive oil and vinegar available at the table. I was kind of disappointed that the bread was not served warm.We started the meal with Antipasti :Insalata Caprese (usual $24++)Vine Ripened Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, White Balsamic VinaigretteSimple but appetizing dish to start with.Prosciutto di Parma (usual $24++)18 Months Aged Parma Ham, Rock Melon, Balsamic ReductionThe sweet juicy melon was balanced by the salty ham.For the Primi Piatti :Penne Carbonara (usual $32++)Crispy Pork Pancetta, Fresh Cream, Egg, ParmesanThe dish was rich and creamy. I was sightly disappointed in the Crispy Pork Pancetta which turned out to be just fried bacon pieces.Fusilli al Granchio (usual $38++)Crabmeat, Asparagus, Sundried Tomatoes, Creamy SauceThere was chunks of crab meat which I like. The sundried tomatoes did not have much flavour in this dish. Disappointed.Next we had the Chef Daily Special which turned out to be Roasted Chicken. The chicken was quite tender. But both of us were too full for it.Lastly for dessert :Panna Cotta (usual $14++)Vanilla Panna Cotta Raspberry Sauce, Anise CookiesThe dessert was milky and creamy, served with pieces of strawberry and kiwi.Lemon Sorbetto (usual $14++)It was lemony and refreshing to taste. There was crumbles under the scoop which balanced the sour taste. The single scoop was topped with juicy berries.Overall the food was not bad but the serving was too much for 2 females and we could not finish them. We were full after having the pasta dishes. Audrey had the roasted chicken take-away as she could not eat anymore. I felt that the standard of the pasta dishes had dropped alot when compared to my previous visit. As the restaurant was crowded, it was very difficult to get the attention of the staffs available. Water was not refilled until we were able to get the attention of the staffs to do so
4
Prego is my go to Italian place because of its good Italian food and awesome discounts. We had a cold cut and cheese platter to share and the Parma ham was good. The crabmeat fusilli was well done with chewy pasta and right amount of crabmea
5
Ordered the usual. She had the pizza margherita and I had the vongole paired with a glass of Pino Grigio. The consistency of the food here is commendable having been around for more than 20 years.
4
We ate breakfast here each morning of our stay. There is a wide selection of food, which is good quality.
2
Been to Prego many times and used to be a great place for dinner. Was disappointed this time when we celebrate our anniversary dinner there. Indeed was pleased when the dining reservation offered complimentary slice of Tiramisu for our celebration when we make the booking. But the waiter was not aware about this arrangement when we have to asked for it after long wait. And yet they charge us for the Tiramisu!!! Poor service nowadays, waiters are not attentive anymore & served our food in a rushing manner without a serving tray, just placed in the middle of table. Such service like dining in a casual kopitiam. Waiter also aren't aware of daily set menu. When we asked for Tomato Herb Bruschetta Spread, the waiter say they don't have it for that day but yet we saw other table have it!!! Food now in smaller portion. We ordered the Rib-eye which is thin & soft, the Sea bass was tasteless & dry. Not value for the money.Prego service & food no longer like previous times. Make our anniversary dinner a lousy one! I will not return again!!
5
As a guest at the Fairmont, we enjoyed breakfast buffet at Prego most mornings.There was a huge range, from bacon and eggs, Asian curries and rice, omelets cooked your way, breakfast soups, fruits, cheeses, pastries, breads etc but the best was the waffles! Oh my, the orange butter cream was a HUGE hit for so many of my travel companions (approx 300!). I definitely will be working on making it myself.Seating was good, many different little areas to sit and enjoy at your leisure. Would have loved to go there for dinner- Italian
4
Prego is a great place for dinner, especially if you are a FAR card member. I love the food there (pick the right items of course) and the service is good but can be improved.Top picks: lobster angels hair, veal ravioli, seafood risotto. i had the squid ink pasta this time round that was done aglio olio style, far too oily, i'll stick to my regulars in future.
5
Stayed at the Fairmont hotel for a week and ate Prego's breakfast every morning.The service is amazing, all the hostesses and waiters are incredible and kind.The food variety is huge and tasty- hot dishes (many kinds), omelette station, cheese plater, fresh fruit, yogurt selections, cereal and toppings, breads, pastry, fresh special smoothies and juice, hot drinks, waffles and pancakes with any possible topping... and I'm probably missing many more options
3
Birthday dinner to celebrate a significant other birthday. Reserved a table on Friday, place was 3/4 filled and bustling. Ambiance was decent enough. The service tho, took awhile. Called for a waiter and that took about 7-8 mins, ordered the buckwheat pasta and the pizza. Food turned out really well and above expectations. Tried calling the waiter for the bill and that took about another 20-30 mins. I understand that the place is slammed but if you foresee such an issue shouldn't a decent restaurant like Prego be hiring more staff to accommodate more people on weekends? The food really saved the experience, the pasta was well flavoured and the balance was great between the broccoli and potatos. The pizza was divine. Top tips - Park at fairmont hotel (aft 6pm it's $3 per entry) - Book a table and request for a window seat, you'll thank me later!- check the credit card promos they had, recently used my Ocbc card and got away with 30% off!
5
Dined here on eve of Mother's Day.I ordered the angel hair pasta with lobster in sweet chilly sauce,taste so good.My daughter had the veal and it taste just as good. For dessert we had the tiramasu which just melts in your mouth,so yummy. The waiters were polite,friendly and pleasant.Been here many times and very pleased with with the meals and service
5
I have come to Singapore since 2008 for business and after staying in various hotels this is the best breakfast in town. Whether you choose continental (cold) or full (hot) breakfast expect a variety of breads, yogurts, fresh juices and fruits, cereals, decent coffee, hot plates etc. Don't miss
4
Went there in the evening after work. I got a table quite fast. I had a pizza and a pana cotta. Meals are good and staff is pleasant. A bit noisy as the place is quite huge. If you want to taste Italian flavors in Singapore you can go there without any doubt.
5
Buffet style breakfast. Everything was tasty & of a good quality. Service staff were polite, friendly & attentive. Hot meals, sweets, pastries, cereals & breads, gluten free section, juices etc Great selection of foods that are presented well. Loved it.
4
Generous food portion and staff was attentive. The set dinner was value for money. Great for special occasions
4
Good range of food, however service wasn't brilliant. Once the staff had taken the order, they lost interest and did not offer puddings or coffee.
4
Thumbs up for their excellent service! The food is nice especially their signature Tiramisu. Take note that the pasta quantity is good for two!
4
A nice place to go to for Sunday lunch.
Though the price for buffet is rather high,
the quality and choices of food were excellent.
5
The overall experience in Prego is good. The food was very nice! And the quatity was huge. Totally worthy !
4
Chosen to have dinner at Prego. Ordered a seafood spaghetti for myself. My friends ordered pizza, spaghetti and lasagne.Noted the restaurant has up most of the prices by about 20%. Decided to give up our favourite dessert "Mudpie" & "Tiramisu" to go elsewhere.Food portion still the same, no longer value for money.Need to reconsider this venue for future gathering. May or may not come again
3
went there for lunch on the first day of their new menu. Was looking forward to the grilled king prawn which is now not in the menu. I noticed the tiramisu was smaller now. The cod and the seabass we ordered was passable and the skins were not crispy. The grill menu consists of mainly beef dishes and not much of a choice.
4
Didn't know prego serve buffet lunch and is only on sunday. A friend invited us because she had some voucher to spend. The buffet spread was nice. They had fresh oyster, salmon sashimi, steam prawn. Some roast pork rib was soso. The dessert and bakery section was the best.They had a good bakery chef, every item I try was up to expectations. We can also order item from the menu but that sunday the food was not as nice as normal day, either different cook or the same cook but sunday mood. Haha!Anyway too much to eat, it was only good value with our one for one voucher otherwise I personally think is expensive $78 ++ I prefer to order ala carte 
4
Part of the Fairmont Hotel, this Italian restaurant offers good food at reasonable prices. It is clean and well laid out and staff are friendly and helpful. Service might not be the quickest but food is cooked fresh and comes piping hot. The restaurant is close to one of the stops on the hop-on hop-off bus service and is used by both locals and tourists
5
High level of service, in fact the best service crew so far! Very attentive and polite.
If you have AMEX card, you can enjoy 50% promotion for 2 diners. Very worth the price and quality of food was great! Tiramisu was my favourite!
5
A great restaurant located on the ground floor of the Fairmont Singapore. Authentic Italian cuisine, with great pizzas and fish. I dined at Prego on a number of occasions while in Singapore on business and was never disappointed.
5
The food was great as always. However the service was not as attentive during the weekdays. The ocbc 30% off for ala carte items was really a good deal.
4
A casual restaurant in the Fairmont Hotel serving Italian food. Pizzas are great and they offer a large variety. The chicken pizza was excellent. Service was good and wines were available but expensive.
4
Nice restaurant attached to the Fairmont Hotel and the Swissotel Hotel. Conveniently in the city near attractions. Food was good. I thought the wine was a bit overpriced but then I remembered it was Singapore where most things cost more.
4
The pasta was fantastic and the staff were attentive. However, the restaurant was slightly noisy and I wont recommend it for dates.
4
This restaurant's specialty is for Italian Foods. The portion of the food was actually a bit too much, even for me who usually eat a lot. But you may need reservation as this restaurant was quite crowded even on weekdays
3
I used to frequent Prego when I was living in Singapore, and it has now become more of a casual eateries for the near by office workers. Especially their special discounts (offered only to Singaporean credit card holders!) that draws in a large lunch crowd. Their food might have to be adjusted to fit the "budget" hence for us paying full price for the meal, it is definitely over priced for what you get
4
We had a lovely dinner - great pasta in lovely surroundings. We also had breakfast the next morning which was plentiful, great quality and variety. The service was great but the astronomical prices for a glass of wine totally preclude that pleasure with our meal. Maybe we are just spoilt in Australia
4
The restaurant is part of the Fairmont Hotel but has an independent atmosphere. It was very well arranged giving a definite Italian feel. The menu was reasonably extensive and the food quality high. An excellent choice for leisure or business. There is plenty of room for larger parties as well. Service was prompt and friendl
4
I had a lovely birthday dinner on 18 March 2016. We enjoyed the food (as usual) and the service. Prego has always been our favorite dinning choice!
3
Pleasant Experiences with a group of friends. The Service Staff's Services can be improve. Food and wine was good.
4
Restaurant was conducive for a biz lunch as it wasnt crowded. Service was very prompt (perhaps a little too prompt) ...
4
Despite my Chope confirmation, Prego has no record of my reservation. Luckily , restaurant wasn't full and there was no problem getting a table for two.
Food and service was good.
4
Service was great. Suggest lobster meat to feature in the bisque, more than one side for the steak and Chianti Classico or Riserva by the glass.
1
One of the worst "Italian" restaurant of ever.. Unbelievable...
The pizza was a joke... they cook a frozen pizza with no taste..
The pasta was pre cooked (also the waiter admit this)and full of garlic.
Incredible how this place is still open.....
4
Brought a couple of overseas friends here for dinner. Though the company certainly was a factor, the food was enjoyable too. We had a couple of pasta dishes, the grilled fish, lamp chops & desserts. The food was enjoyable but what was memorable was the bread & the dip. Glad we didn't order a starter so that we can focus on enjoying the bread.The downers was the air-conditioner wasn't operating well. So it was a little warm during our dinner. Getting the attention of the servers required more effort that in most great restaurants
1
Food was not worth the price point. Gave a feedback, underseasoned dish was taken away and returned without a change. Friend ordered aglio olio but was served vongole, other pastas and risotto were below expectations. I'd rather done at fish and co's for calamari and other Italian restaurants a lot a fraction of prego's price. Really prego? Is this the kind of standard and service you want to upkeep? You've lost 4 returning customers here
5
We ate at Prego because we were flying out VERY early in the morning and staying at the Fairmont. It was also our anniversary! We had a lovely time; had separate salads (both huge) and shared a pizza and a bottle of wine. The food and wine were tasty and the service spot on
5
Definitely earns its inclusion in guide books. An excellent Italian in Fairmont hotel offering a wide selection of food & drink in a great setting. We hadn't booked but managed to get a table for two. Very attentive staff, extensive menu and full of people obviously enjoying themselves. Our starters and main courses were excellent - both the pasta and chicken dishes. Quite reasonably priced for quality of food and surroundings and definitely worth it 
5
Never disappointed by prego's.. Especially good for families with young kids...they also did a great job with the birthday cake and singing!!
5
This remains my favorite restaurant as I am never disappointed here. My medium rare steak was perfect, with the truffle & mushroom sauce. The side dish of mashed potatoes is most creamy and yummy. Loved the 5-cheese pizza as always.
1
- Food portion was miserable (Not value for money)
- Foods not tasty
- Poor service by staff:
A) Tables were not cleared and drinks were not refilled
B) Long waiting time for food
4
As usual, good food and good service. With the Amex Platinum Far Card, its only 50% for set meal for 2 pax.
3
I love their dessert...their main course a bit disappointing for me cuz my food was cold when served
3
Food was average, service was decent. Probably would not return again for the amount paid, can get better pasta elsewhere :/
2
When I was young, my father brought me here for my first real Italian meal and I loved it. That was over 10 years ago. Things have changed. The prices are very high and the portions have shrunk (like so many fine dining restaurants) the taste is no longer as it once was.
3
I love the pizza here but the pasta is just average. The biggest let down is the lack of design and zero ambiance. It's more of a workplace canteen than a restaurant. High ceilings and lots of noise. Everyone talking loud just to be heard.Service is average with the servers having to be asked for more water or desert. Very much a grab a quick dinner and go place but pricier. Better places like poulet in the basement
1
There is really nothing I can recommend about this restaurant. The food was ok but then who can't cook pasta these days. I would probably have given this restaurant a bit better review except the service was really awful. The waiter that took our drink order accidentally brought us still water instead of sparkling and insisted that this is what we ordered. And in an unpleasant fashion as well. The waitress who took our meal order was simply without any ability to do her job. It was as if the restaurant had simply grabbed the first passer by they encountered. It was bad. This restaurant is not cheap. The customers deserve much better.
4
Singapore is an expensive city for dining especially if you eat in restaurants situated within hotels. Prego is no exception- food was good as was the service but the pricing was over the top. £6 for a bottle of water and no wine for less than £40 made for our shared starter, pasta and no pudding to come to £120 for two! Bad valu
4
The quality of the food is perfect and the choice is really impressive. From breakfast to dinner you make always a safe choice.
4
The restaurant has been able to maintain consistent quality of food for so many years and I am impressed.
4
Been there numerous times and food quality usually do not disappoint. Can't say the same about the service though. Go for the grill items. Good meats used for both beef and lamb. Pasta portions are large and good for sharing.
4
Everything we ordered was freshly prepared and served in good time. Love the friendly and attentive staff !
2
Went for a valentine's day dinner with my wife after so many good reviews from friends over the years. Finally got to try it. Food wise was sub-par, perhaps we didn't order the more popular items on the menu. Though the most horrible experience came from 1 of the servers name Arjay. Asked for the bill from afar and he didn't acknowledge or answered anything and just walked over to the cashier's machine (Looked at us blankly). When the bill came and we asked for our leftover items to be wrapped, again there's no words coming out of his mouth. Felt like he barely wanted to talk to us. When the wrapped items came, he just came and stood there silently, expecting me to take the plastic from his hand. I was even surprised that he appeared out of nowhere, since I was looking at somewhere else at that moment.And the worst thing was that he gave us the wrong bill from the other table, though it was my mistake as well not to check it beforehand.The experience was a total letdown, and gave us the impression that the restaurant prefers Caucasian guests to locals (Since there's a lot of them). The first ever nasty experience coming from a 5-star chain
4
Great food, great service, great location. across the road from Raffles with prices I can afford [though only just]. The staff were very friendly and helpful. this is a popular place to eat and sometimes there can be a loing queue to get in. We tried three times over three days to get in before success and we were guests of the Hotel in which it sits. it is a little piece of italy in Asia. the pasta was excellent, the fish great and the soup tasty. a good place to eat if you get the chance. Oh, and the Pizza was good also.
5
My kids love Prego! And even if I try suggesting we try a new place, they turn a deaf ear...So went back there the third time in the last few months (we fortunately rotate between cuisines)...We go on a lunch date usually. The kids and I.And the two of them order the set meal. One with the penne taratufate and the other the spinach and ricotta ravioli in tomato sauce .. And I order their pizza..Every dish is perfect! Even the bread basket in the beginning along with their most awesomely presented tomato pate or cream cheese is brilliant!And if you think it ends there, they surprise you yet again with their fab desserts! Our favourites are the pannacota and the tiramisu !!Our server yesterday and always was extremely polite. And Mr Remes who also attend the table just floored me with his helpfulness! This restaurant scores a 7 on its service for sure! A pleasant visit and a must do!
4
Nice cosy place to meet up with friends and catch up with old times. Perhaps it's still Chinese New Year season so the restaurant was not so crowded and therefore not so noisy. Food's nice and the waiter service's great. While we were settling our bill, we asked for discount but unfortunately they only have one for a certain card. None of us has that bur what surprised us was the manager gave us a Chinese New Year discount. Certainly a nice gesture
5
It was a very wonderful experience when we went for dinnet at Prego. The foods are very delicious being served by very accommodating people especially the guy named Mr. Sed (staff). He was an asset to the restaurant as he served our food very fast! I will definitely come back and enjoy their food again! I must say when you guys visit Singapore you might not to miss trying the food at Prego. Two thumbs up
3
Ate at Pregos on Christmas night. Nice restaurant but was busy and not a quiet atmosphere. Decided to go with a set dinner that offered different choices. I chose a salad(very small), a small fish dish(very tasty but small as well), pasta dish which was very disappointing. The flavor was good but for the main course is would not have satisfied my 7 year old. Then for desert I had the tiramisu. That was very good. My co-worker was not over impressed either for spending over 50 USD and that was just on the food. Food was good and some bordering on very good. But very small portions left us feeling disappointed with the portion sizes
3
Lunch for 4 at Prego's which became quite busy from 1pm onwards. Competent if unspectacular italian food
4
Good environment and efficient staff. Prices are on slightly high side.
Convient location for business discussion .
4
I like the smoothie bar, the omelette bar and the huge range of choices for breakfast, Staff are great.
4
We went to this place for a friend's birthday lunch without a reservation (yeah, we're sad that way). But we were promptly accommodated and very well served. I ordered the arugula salad. Be warned, it's massive and almost the main course. My two friends had a glass of red wine each and ravioli and a pizza. All great. The ambience is casual and great for a non-fussy, relaxed lunch
5
Excellent service, great food. Servings were big and staff made it easy for sharing. It was my aunt's birthday and they presented her with a mini slice of cake and even sang a birthday song! The noise level in the restaurant was a bit high though...
2
on the new year day 1/1/2016, we have our lunch there. at a quick glance on the menu, it will not be difficult to realise that the menu is overprice - appetiser ranging from 25-30 dollars, pasta around 35-40 dollars etc...so the most logical choice seem to be the set menu at 49 dollars for an appetiser/pasta/desert. the calamari was chewy and the batter was hard. the seafood aglio olio was equally bad with the no garlic taste at all and the seafood was also over cooked. this restaurant cannot survive the test of time, the service and cook staffs are not able to maintain the standard that they used to have a decade ago
4
We enjoyed a lovely seafood pasta here after arriving at the Fairmont hotel in the evening. This was a great option. The restaurant is large but not barn like. The menu is pretty much standard Italian. Not entirely inspired but nonetheless adequate. There are plenty of wine choices. Not the place for a long evening meal but a quick one course or maybe two without too much hip pocket damage
3
Prego located at Raffles City serves average Italian dishes with prices in my opinion quite expensive. They have many trainees plus occasionally trainee manager who sometimes can't handle situation that arises. Food is average, nothing to shout about. There are many other Italian restaurants in Singapore that are better, again in my opinion. It's best to make a reservation before going over. Enjoy!

Have always wanted to eat this place with my family but it has always been fully booked. Finally got the chance to eat it this weekend with my family of 6. We ordered a variety of dishes - lobster bisque, mushroom soup, calamari. Those were all really good and worth ordering. The mains were not bad too, like the pizza and fettuccine, but not especially good. They served bread to go with the soup / as appetisers too, which went really well with vinegar and olive oil (which were not served till we asked for it), though my family always thought that it most italian restaurants would give those to go with bread. The service was not as good, as the waitresses removed some small plates which were already on our table and replaced them with bigger ones, which we had no idea what was happening, but we ended up short of plates. They were also not very attentive and not very well trained, which was unexpected given the price that we were paying.It was a pleasant dining experience overall but I would not come again due to poor service and the food not being very worth it

One of the best Italian food in Singapore. Usually order a set meal which comes with a salad, pasta, chef special and dessert. Tried the Diavola pizza and gluten free penna today. Very delicious. Service is great as well. Cost is around S$40-50 per head without discount. But there are discount cards like Feed At Raffles card which makes it affordable
5
Prices at Prego is reasonable and if u have Amex or Feed-at- Raffles card, u get 1-for-1 or 50% off! Pastas are all good (carbonara, seafood marinara, vongole) & my favorite pizza is the 5-cheese one. Tiramisu is extremely yummy too
4
Order caesar salad, gnocchi, parma ham pizza, ravioli, and tiramisu cake for dessert. Taste good even though the price is a bit expensive
3
The food was tasty and service was friendly. Unfortunately the restaurant was pretty loud and busy, it was difficult to hold a conversation over lunch.
4
The lobster angel hair was superb. Very delicious. We have been going to Prego for a long time. And we have always been very happy with the standard of food and service.

We are a family of 8 adults and 5 kids and booked two restaurants tonight and we had to confirm which one to eat for New Year's Eve. I was happy not to have followed the recent reviews of trip advisor as we had a wonderful dinner with Prego. It started with the warm foccacia with the cream cheese and olive tapenade, followed by mushroom soup and lobster bisque, then the 5 cheese pizza and an array of pasta - vongole linguini, carbonara, gnocchi. We also had the lamb chops with bleu cheese and tried the seafood risotto. ended the night with panacotta with berries. No miss in any of the dishes. Even the server, Jaime, was attentive to the group despite the full house. All in all, the ranking in trip advisor truly reflects the quality of the food and service in this restaurant. Will gladly eat here again anytime I am craving Italian food in Singapore!

I had my lunch with my friends today.The ambience of the restaurant is good. The place is spacious. Although there is crowd, you will still be able to converse easily with your friends.We ordered set lunch menu. It was value for money. You can choose one antipasti, main course and dessert. The serving each was not reduced (some restaurants' food serving will be reduced simply because it is set lunch). The only thing is, for the main course, you can only choose pasta and not other range of cooked food in the menu. There is limited choices too for set lunch but you cannot expect too much, since it is set menu. So bear that in mind, everything is good.Service from the staffs was quite prompt and attentive too.We had discount too because we made payment using American Express credit card.
3
We come here every year for our annual Christmas Eve lunch. Sadly the food has gone downhill over the years. The calamari rings were soft and tasteless (I think they forgot to season??) and the risotto was dry. The selection in the menu has also sadly reduced. I'm not sure what has happened to This restaurant, but it USED to be great!
2
Dinner on Sun, 20 Dec coming in with expectations because of the reviews. Ordered the veal ravioli ($34), fettuccine with beef ragu ($32) and caprese salad. Was served bread with cream cheese while waiting - got me excited as it was pretty good. The pasta then arrived with 7 tiny pieces of ravioli. The veal felt dry. For the fettuccine, it was just really average - nothing outstanding. The salad didn't have enough olive oil. i was sorely disappointed and doubt I'll be returning
2
The calamari was oily and soggy. The grilled sea bass had a strong fishy smell. The chicken pizza was not memorable. Only the beef tenderloin and the ravioli were good. All in all, a very disappointed meal as compared to our previous dining experiences at Prego
1
This is the third time I have been to this restaurant, having been forced by my own doubts to give it the benefit of the doubt, all these top notch reviews cant be wrong can they?Well the first time I came here I was looking for a bargain - I had an American Express Platinum card and the receptionist told me I could get the advertised 50% off. When it came to pay time I was told I couldn't as my card wasn't issued in Singapore. Believe me the prices are exorbitant here for what is a very very ordinary Italian style restaurant.So the last two times I was with someone who had the required Singapore issue card so the discount was on. I would not come here without it. Even at 50% discount it is stretching it a bit.So to the restaurant. Don't expect intimate surroundings. Someone said it feels like an airport restaurant. That's a little unfair. To the airport I mean. A plain high ceiling is studded with bright spotlights which shine on your food and everyone else. The arrangement of tables makes it feel like you are eating in a canteen. Its not for a romantic tete a tete. It's for birthday parties. The said discount needs to be explained. You need to order 2 mains. Don't expect to be told what constitutes 2 mains. Also the menu has a chef's special - 4 courses for about $85 after taxes etc. The waiter was very keen to warn us they were small versions of the a la carte. Only certain items on the menu are included. Don't expect to be told which. We had to ask the waiter/ess back three times to extract the full story. The service is listless and disinterested at best. We had to pour our own wine and no refill of water was offered. Also don't expect a change of cutlery between courses.On to the food. Last time I came here I ordered calamari (one of a few starters on aforesaid chef's special). It was soggy greasy and chewy like rubber. This is high end? This time ordered the caprese salad (retails for almost $30 by the way) A bowl of cherry tomatoes with ONE lump of mozarella. And about one basil leaf ripped up and spread in the olive oil. Fair to say the crabmeat fusilli was delicious. It wasn't fusilli though. And it is not fresh pasta. The main course - seabass. Well the seabass would have been overdone even if it had been taken out of the microwave a minute or two earlier. It sat on what appeared to be chopped raw aubergine in tomato ketchup. The last time I came here I had codfish which was also overcooked. The mains retail for over $50 inc taxes. At full price this would be scandalous. At half price its just a serious disappointment.I am told that Prego does a great Sunday brunch. I don't doubt it. Its just that on my experience of three visits on Saturday nights after the rush (the restaurant was less than a third full) I would say it is the worst Italian restaurant in Singapore. Sorry Prego, you are living on a reputation that comes from being attached to one of the classiest hotels in Singapore. Please do better. There are some great Italian restaurants in Singapore
5
We tried the Sunday buffet which was worth the price. The choices were many and food was very good. The service was a little slow but very personalized. I recommend this restaurant as one of the better ones
5
We were unable to do reservation...apparently not allowed. So we just try our luck by arriving around 7pm. It was full with people but we managed to get a table immediately. Ordered scallops for appetizer and a fish dish. Very happy with the meal.
4
Visited Prego on a busy Saturday evening for dinner, the staffs were very courteous and service standards were good. Waiting time for dishes weren't too long too. In short, I would definitely be back for more!
5
Since i was staying in Fairmont , tried the food from Prego twice. Once i had a cheeza pizza and second time a Veg Pizza. Both the times it was thin crust and perfectly baked pizza.
4
Came here for both breakfast - as I was staying at the Fairmont - and also for dinner. The food is very good, with decent portion sizes, but the service was rather rushed - probably because they are always busy.
4
Food was awesome. Had Parma ham and foie gras for starters, followed by spaghetti pescatora and lobster ravioli, chef special (fish) and tiramisu for dessert. Good portions and delicious. Will visit again
4
 my girl friend who din at prego regularly, always praise the food there. i've not been the for more than 20 years I think.So decided to give it a try, invited my daughter parent in law for dinner. Was very happy with the meal, portion not to huge, taste Italian the tirimisu was great.Price wise is a little expensive, but if consider the restaurant within a five star hotel is acceptable. Also as they offer discount for far card members hope they keep the food standard high and consistent and don't disappoint people like us who loves good food. As with discount they draw quite a good crowd and that channel to productive business rather than having few table at any one time and u might see restless bored staff.Read some review before I wrote mine. I found the staff there was polite, services is on time I'm overall happy.Good food good service. Keep up the good work prego.

the other reviewers to a different restaurant?I ordered a grilled ribeye. It came redolent of the wonderful aromas of the microwave. I ordered it medium rare. Not only was it medium rare, it was barely medium warm. Juicy? Not. Evidently the freezing and thawing had desiccated this meat into a thoroughly bloodless perfectly mechanically sliced matchbox thick cut. Chewy. Yes. The ample gristle added real texture to this relatively expensive paperback slab of meat. Flavor. I tried salting the meat using the very trendy grinder with the hundred dollar diamond sized crystals. Very trendy. Except no one in the restaurant has tried the grinders to check if they actually produced. My wife had the shrimp. Frozen. But at least fresh. Did I mention that my oven roasted potatoes were under cooked, not fully raw and not fully warm.Would I eat here again? No. I was staying in the hotel and was not going to write it up, but the restaurant, high price combined with low quality, precipitated this and the review of the Fairmont Hotel to follow.Now you may ask why I didn't complain or send the food back. I have never felt that it should be my roll as a diner to do quality control for a restaurant. Okay, the off odd glitch, I may report in the hopes of a correction. However, when there's a complete system failure, it's not my job.The wait staff was polite
5
My 6yo was well taken care by krim when we were there. Changing cutlery to child friendly set, complimentary apple juice, attentive to little requests made - that was world class service! This is on top of the delicious feast that we had, especially the vongole - there's actually "wok hei"
5
It was my first time to try this restaurant with my good friends. Upon arrival, we were greeted and welcome with a big smile. We were assisted and served the whole evening by "Jaime" ~ he was an angel! He was smiling all the time from serving the appetizer, salad, pasta, pizza until dessert. He even gave us suggestions which he thinks we surely will love. He even helped us took our group photos, not just once. Anyways, the aura of the restaurant was cozy that you think that you are just home. Of course, the food was fantastic. I will never forget the super crispy pizzas! We indeed have a Happy Tummy afterwards.
4
Run out of the mill restaurant that serve decent Italian food. Tad disappointing with the menu and quality of food, almost to the point that it doesn't make an effort to want to impress.
4
The portions were big for asians and the total bill for 3 persons was $240
Pasta portion is very filling
Staff were attentive and service time was about 15 mins for the food to arrive
4
I came to this restaurant 22 years ago and astonishing to come back and it is still charming. Great selection of dishes and an impressive decor and atmosphere inside.
4
I had breakfast at this restaurant which was part of the Fairmont hotel package. The selection was excellent .. From continental to Asian and a wide selection of pastries. The staff were also very attentive and friendly .. Always smiling.
5
Staying at Hotel Fairmont, I use this restaurant for Breakfast mainly. Excellent spread and great friendly service.
Their Fresh juices are excellent and they make good morning boosters.
3
Nothing special from the breakfast spread except for the drinks We had a variety of juices (high energy, detox, cooling,etc), coffee and tea.
5
we always love having breakfast at Prego, George, who has been there for many years always looks after us with excellent service, something that does not happen at many restaurants now.The buffet breakfast there is amazing, from fresh juices to eggs any way you like plus smoked salmon, etc etc, the best I have ever seen around the globe.But George really makes things happen for you, "a special order" not a problem, can't speak too highly of the service and Christian, the F&B Manager is a delight! Well done Prego
4
Prego is one of my all time favorite italian resturants. the standard is always impeccable, the quality is great and service is always better than most places. we arrived at 10pm for a late bite. we had a wild mushroom soup, cesaer salad and pork belly. when the food arrived, the waitress forgot to apportion the huge bowl of soup even though we had told her upfront that 2 of us were sharing. minus points for that. i guess she was too busy talking about the italian beer my other friend was ordering. at closing time which was around 11pm, we had to wait quite a while for the bill because the staff were in the back room chatting away. so apart from these 2 incidents, i am glad the food was still worth the tr
4
Had a great lunch again at Prego. It's a great deal to have set lunch there that includes antipasto, main and dessert. Great antipasto with rock melon and rocket leaves. Pasta is great as usual. End the great meal with coffee and tiramisu.Service is also great with very pleasant and friendly servers
2
Prego is an old favorite having been around for 20 years. I hadn't eaten there for about five years. However the food is expensive for what you get,without a discount card, portion sizes small (for my fish), food quality average, and menu is boring. The decor is in need of a face lift. Wait staff quality is average. Finally it's noisy for work dinners. The only advantage is its convenient location. Sorry I won't be back as there are better value and quality restaurants elsewhere.
4
Went there with friends on Friday evening, full house with a few tables celebrating birthday! Portion quite big for ladies I feel...I had one soup and one carbonara, very full for me!
5
Loved our 2 meals here. Prices reasonable , service and food amazing! The display of the restaurant and cleanliness was top notch
5
We had breakfast each morning as part of our Fairmont Hotel stay. There's a good selection of breakfast on offer including Chinese, Indian, Japanese and European foods. The staff in the restaurant are very friendly and helpful.
4
This restaurant is well located in Raffles City and has a nice ambience for large groups. Great bread basket and wonderful service!
5
I made a reservation for Sunday Lunch buffet for 2 people. The restaurant is located at the ground floor of the Fairmont hotel. There was a live band that played during our visit. The food was great (see attached pictures and menu). They will give you a list of main menu that you can order (comes with the buffet) and they have a buffet table for other food like pizza, salad, seafood (oyster, prawns, etc), desserts and a carving station (turkey, beef, duck). We paid SGD 68++ (++ 10% Service charge and 7% GST) for the 2 of us but we used our AMEX card (promotion, 50% off) so the total bill came up down to only SGD 68++ for 2 people. Definitely recommending this restaurant especially if you have AMEX Singapore issued card
5
We had the FAR card and were able to get a good value for our table of two. I've always been a fan of their Italian fare. Not to mention their delicious complimentary house made bread and spread of the day! Place was quite kid-friendly, and even provided crayons and drawing pads. The waiters were very friendly and came by often to attend to our needs
5
Friend and I were celebrating over a quick lunch. The atmosphere is convivial, service was excellent and the food perfectly in harmony. We shared the meat antipasti - a generous plate, then had superbly cooked beef cheeks. Bottle of Amazon to top things off and we went on our separate ways replete and contented. Much to be recommende
3
Arrived without reservation - receptionist extremely professional, friendly and outstanding english.Got a good table on the window with good view.Simple but nice Italian trattoria style furnitureService was friendly and efficientFood - bread basket too small (2 tiny pcs. of white and 2 tiny pcs of special bread), rucola salad - fresh and large portion, beef tenderloin (filetto di manzo) well prepared and tasty with a small portion of puree and a not so phantastic truffle & mushroom sauce.the dessert - panino tiepido is a filled brioche with vanilla ice cream and some strawberry - quite good.In all a good experience in a nice ambiance, but food below my expectations for the pric
3
Not too impressed with the eatery: first the hostess just dropped us off at our table... she was gone so quickly that when I turned, she was nowhere to be seen... she had no chance to hear my request for one of the many empty tables by the window rather than the busy throughway. Once we flagged down a waiter, he was able to get us such a table and we got to make our choices of food. The prices are - as everyone had warned us - Singaporean-style high. We had the Caprese Salad which was very good, the Rucola Salad ... also very good and the lasagna. Very nice. The food was - aside from the price tag - very satisfying. Alas, the atmosphere - as I wrote in my title - reminded me very much of this restaurant "Spaghetti Factory" back in Oakland, CA. Just didn't do it for me.
4
Despite some not so good reviews here, we decide to try this restaurant because it is located in the same building our hotel is. And we were very happy with our choice! The restaurant has pizza and some assorted plates. We were not very hungry and decided for bruschettas, soup and salads. They were all delicious with a reasonable price
2
With all the fabulous restaurants on offer in Singapore, I would not eat here again.Very small main course portions, overpriced, no atmosphere.. reminded me of a restaurant at an airport.
3
The server did not wait for us to finish our soup and appetizer and started serving our main course.
The pasta portion is big. Good for sharing for small eaters.
5
Value for money and best service. The pasta was great and delicious. The dessert, Tirmisu is the signature.
4
Prego offers a large range of pasta based dishes as well as antipasto and other Italian food. The atmosphere was more of a cafe and service was a bit slow. But the food was good and we enjoyed our meal.
5
Excellent tasty riavolli but portion too small for me but pasta is always very top notch! Will come back again
4
We ordered the OCBC SG50 dinner set. The baked calamari, crab fusilli and chicken were delicious. It was an enjoyable meal.
4
As an Amex FAR member, I was accorded a 50% voucher for 6 to 12 diners at any of their restaurant establishment under Swissotel. We decided on Prego (even thou I have had pretty lack lustre experience before). The place was crowded on a Friday evening and at times, you will need to speak at the top of your voice. They offered a value for money set dinner at 69 per pax with selected choice of Anti pasta, Primi (a smaller portion), a chef special ( oven baked thigh) & a desert. The carbonara stole the show that night. It was initially a safe choice out of the various options presented, but it turned out to be the best. We had Angel hair pasta with lobster ( small portion of lobster) and it was delicious too. Pizza with 5 cheese was well crafted and the lobster bisque was good ( thou I didn't find much of lobster meat in it) and the staff split the soup into 2 portio for us. Gelato was heavenly with pistachio being my personal favorite. The service staff was prompt most of the time, but it was clearly understaffed. I can see customers sitting at obscure corners waving relentlessly to no avail. So, I guess finding a centralised seating helps. Advice, for 2 diners, 1 set dinner is sufficient and you can top up a soup or a pizza for sharing. My heartfelt thanks goes out to the staff members who helped to present my friends with the lovely birthday cakes. Sharon also initiated to take a group photo for us, which was very much welcomed. This changed my view of Prego and I hope it will continue to improve and scale new heights.
3
Didn't realize the restaurant serves a semi buffet on weekends so had no choice but to take the semi buffet. For seafood lovers it's money for value at $78 ++ and since we don't eat seafood I rated it average value for money. Main can be ordered from the menu, salad, starter anti pasti are on the buffet. Desserts are good though. The hazelnut pudding pear tart and the choc cake were good.
4
Sumptuous brunch buffet with a live performance on stage. A pity that my wife and I could not try all the different pastas on the buffet menu. Would be better to go in big groups so that you can order different dishes to share! The price is a tad pricey though
5
To be honest, the food felt so so (we went for the weekend brunch buffet), but I am very impressed with the service of the staff - friendly, professional, accommodating and nice. Service so excellent it makes up for everything else. Not to say the food was bad - the food was good just not in the "excellent" category like the service is
5
Great Italian food, watch your pizza being made, reasonable priced wine in a bright and beautiful restaurant
4
It's been a while since I last visited Prego. As usual, delicious pizza n cod fish. We ordered some aged ham and it tasted wonderful! Try it if you haven't. A bit pricy restaurant too.
3
Tonight we dined at Prego. We booked a table for 18:30 which was the start of dinner service. We ordered then we waited. The first starter arrived then nothing else. 20mins passed before the second starter arrived. Meanwhile our baby was getting a bit agitated and everyone else who came in after us got there food. When our mains arrived (40mins after ordering) the food was pretty good. The prawns were a bit over cooked but forgivable.
4
Have not lived in Singapore for a long time and for some reason it never came to mind when we were in the area. This past week we were wondering where to eat and just happened to pass by the restaurant. We were shown to our table and the waiters were very attentive. We ordered a bottle of wine and they provided a decanter at our request. Again very attentive. The food was great, as I remembered, and the the Baileys coffee, to finish, was very well prepared.All in all a great dinner that brought back fond memories
3
Went for a business lunch last week. Ordered pork belly for main course and was shocked when the dish arrive, it looks pale and similar to any local hawker centre presentation. The meat is rather tough, skin not crispy and the potion is too huge...My other colleagues order pasta and their comment is okay, so in general nothing special on this place. Pricing decent
2
Ate at Prego 6th September 2015. The decor is kind of cafe style, unfortunately the cuisine isn’t even that good. For antipasti ordered the Scamorza all Piastra. First of all the Scamorza was supposed to have been smoked (I love Scamorza). The Cheese that arrive was in fact not an Italian Scamorza and not even smoked, but a poor Halloumi, sliced extremely thinly in an attempt to disguise the cheese. The sautéed mushrooms were cold and slimy and without taste, then a bunch of various leaves with no dressing. The next course did not improve; overcooked risotto is not my favourite. Regardless of price, simply isn’t good enough. Whilst the service is polite, its slow and not well trained. There are far far better restaurants in Singapore. Don’t disappoint yourself!!
4
I went to Prego for lunch during my visit in Singapore as I was meeting a friend there. the place was nicely decorated so you could feel relaxed. Service was ok not obtrusive but food did take longer than average to arrive. Food quality is pretty good and a nice place to go for lunch. Menu has a good balance of dishes ranging from appetizers, to pastas, pizzas and a few main course dishes.
4
A place me and my family always frequent....not the best of Ambience and always busy but the great service and the delicious food more than makes up for it. I admire the chief chef whom I have noticed many a time taking personal interest in ensuring that everything is always exceptionally goo
5
My all time favorite Italian joint in town. Never fails to impress. Love their breads, cheese spreads is oh so yummy. And the pasta is to die for... Esp if they have truffles on the menu... With pasta and you never go wrong. The staff are very attentive and professional. Remember to book in advance as it's mostly packed esp on weekends
4
I was staying at the Swissotel and came here for lunch with my parents and enjoyed my visit very much. The food is delicious, service is good. The restaurant is huge, which means at times, there are a lot of patrons inside and can get a tinge noisy. It's not one of those cosy, romantic places you would go on a date, but it's worth a visit nonetheless.
4
Visited for breakfast whilst staying in hotel. Huge buffet breakfast on offer. Expensive yes. But an amazing array of foods on offer. Suits all tastes. And good quality coffee, enjoyed that very much.
4
It is a big restaurant, and therefore slightly noisy but the ambiance was good. The food was delicious and service was very good. Thanks!
2
The best point for eating there is the location. Otherwise it is very similar to eating at a fast food joint. In fact there is a fast food beside this place. I quite like the crowd which is less and few and far between.
1
The atmosphere and services were great but the food was very disappointing. I expect much better standard for food especially when the prices are so steep.

This morning my wife and I went to Prego for breakfast which is one of our favourite Sunday breakfast venue.When we arrived there it was long queue,when our turn came, the hostess led us to a table but we found that it was a warm corner and requested to change. As a result we re-queue again. However this time we were not attended even though our turn has come. Upon checking we were told that the hostess tried to arrange a bigger table for us. But that was not the request we had made. We merely asked for another cooler place to seat. I told her that if she didn't understand my English she could always ask someone who could understand better to communicate with me. When we reached our table, to my surprise she purposely lifted up the cutlery and hit on the table and caused a 'bang' sound in front of me. This was the first time I received such 'surprise and unpleasant gift' from a restaurant. I have informed the management of the Hotel for their action and of course we have forgone our beautiful Sunday
4
I've been going to Prego for over 10 years...it's become my neighborhood corner joint. Like any good corner joint the staff light up like they're seeing an old friend whenever I show up and welcome me back (even though it's only been a week since they last saw me). While they have a great menu selection I usually eat the same things week after week and they are: beef carpaccio and caprese salad or the oven baked half chicken with roasted potatoes and veggies. If I'm super hungry I'll also order a selection of Italian cold cuts and some marinated mushrooms and anchovies from the appetizer bar. I also would heartily recommend their ravioli with butter and sage sauce but there's only four or five raviolis so plan on ordering some other main course dishes, such as the sea bass or grilled lamb chops. For desserts they have all the classics, including panna cotta and tiramisu, both of which are just the perfect balance of creamy and sweet to compliment a nice shot of Italian espresso. If you're a fan of the shows at the esplanade, like I am, and are looking for a great late night pizza or plate of pasta after the show, Prego's last order is late, like 11 or 11:30, so definitely check it out for a late night munch! A word of caution, all this good food is not cheap, so be sure you have a pocket full of cash or a credit card to pay for your meal. But if you make Prego your neighborhood joint you will also enjoy the occasional free appetizer, dessert, or digestif. Cheers!!

We were disappointed as the Restaurant was well laid out with a pleasing dÃ©cor and a wide ranging Menu both food and drinks.Perhaps we were expecting too much but:1. The seafood risotto was too sweet! Rice was cooked to perfection along with generous portions of seafood. Waiter advised the risotto was prepared in lobster broth - understood I cook my Seafood Risottos in prawn broth but not that sweet.2. My wife had the Gnocci with a blue cheese sauce! She said she had trouble tasting the blue cheese although the gnocci was well prepared and the sauce of a good consistency.As I said, perhaps it was us but the waiter did have us complete a complaint form for the Chef
3
This is still one of my fav. Italian rest. The food quality is great however, the "class" and service of this rest. has started to wane... The place needs another (perhaps) minor renovation... and so does some of their service staff. The tables and chairs are starting to show signs of ageing but, thankfully, the food is consistently great
4
On the first night of our honeymoon and first night in Singapore we went to Prego having just checked into the Fairmont hotel next door.We both fancied pizza, I had the Hawaiin whilst the wife had the meat feast equivalent (can't remember name sorry) we ended up having half of each other's and both were really tasty. Probably the best pizza I've had since being in Italy!We also both had a glass of red wine which again was very palatable if not a tad expensive. But basically London prices so not a massive shocker for a Brit.I wouldn't go again only because there are literally so many places to eat in Singapore, but if you're near the Fairmont and want somewhere nice to eat this place is great. I would recommend going here unlike the place on the corner outside (marche I think) which smelt like a sewer
5
There are many Pizza Places in Singapore... Some with reasonable prices.. This is really a place with reasonable place for pizza, but good quality of pizza. Service is also not bad. I think they have early dinner promotion so when I went around 8pm... it was crowded. Will I go back? Probably if I want to be safe.. I don't need to make a booking since it filters number ppl by high price..
5
I love the relax atmosphere of this Italian restaurant. The staff are very friendly. They also provide nice food as well. I like their pizza very much.
5
Good food and even better service. Even better if you have the FAR card and the AMEX platinum card. I am a recurring customer and will come again.
4
The restaurant is at Fairmont Hotel. The staff is friendly and attentive and the food was reasonably priced for the quality of food. It is authentic Italian cuisine cooled by Italians.
4
Been here for a weekday lunch and enjoyed the food. It is a good choice as the environment is condusive and relatively quiet for a discussion. Good service as well.
2
Charges at this restaurant are exorbitant. You can easily spend S$100 to S$200 per person and then you will be treated as if the restaurant has done you a big favour to give you the rickety wooden, back breaking chairs to sit on. The service staff seems to be in short supply and customers simply cannot get the attention of the few staff attending this large restaurant. Food quantities were miserly. Food quality barely tolerable. Place looked more like a railway station and not like an upmarket restaurant
3
We ate here for five mornings during our stay. While dishes are good, the variety was not much and we found the food to be rather repetitive. The nasi lemak was one of my favourites, but there was little variety there. On previous stays, they at least had fried sambal eggs or otah. This trip it was essentially sambal chili, cucumber slices, deep fried anchovies and peanuts and chicken. The prata was also a little hard, having been cooked earlier and then placed in the warming pan. The pancakes and waffles were actually the best dish - fresh, crispy (for the waffles) and nice with the vanilla butter and various jams and kaya available.I must say that the breakfasts at the Edge, when we stayed at the Pan Pacific on the last trip as Fairmont was fully booked, certainly has more variety and more stations. Also, it was very crowded and getting a table sometimes requires a wait.Service was still good and the waitstaff still remember our names and our drink preferences from the many times that we have stayed here
2
"Meh" was invented to review a restaurant like this. The decor is tacky fake Italian (fake wheels of parmesan decorate one high shelf, artfully arranged cans of tomatoes another), the menu uninspired. Service is fine but somehow disconnected or uninformed about Italian cuisine. I felt like I was served by a friendly person who could never imagine why people would eat Italian food. The food is OK, nothing special, and at 5X or so more expensive than the excellent food court downstairs in the mall, so not worth it. Wine by the glass is mediocre and ridiculously pricey. There are alas more and more of these overblown overpriced uninspired western restaurants in Singapore. Skip them. An outlet of Food Republic is far better

Italien-style with marketplace atmosphere. Very open und very busy.Food was surprisingly good and somewhat Italian. We were wirh a large crowd and they could easily handle 50 people. Food was a bit cold but still ok. Wagyu like butter is mot existant in Italy but still tasty.Go there for a bite but not for romantic evening

I have been dining at Prego Italian restaurant for years. Situated on the ground floor of Fairmont Hotel, I love the bright airy feel of this authentic Italian eatery. I also love the curved shape of the restaurant and the ample window tables.The food has always been excellent, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. They are very accommodating if you have any special requests, as I normally do. The staff are very courteous and remember the regulars.Their Tiramisu is a signature dish and draws diners in all the time. A must-have.If you a FAR Card or Amex Platinum, you pay 50% if two people dine, 33% off if it's a party of three pax

Longing for a taste of Italia? Head in to Prego & Fairmont. The service is good and the servers are polite.You can opt for Set Lunch or Set Dinner. You can also go for Ala Carte should you wanna have your own choice.Food is great with reasonable price amidst great environment. You can drive, take a cab or even take the MRT.Give it a tr

One of the nicer Italian restaurants in Singapore..The antipasti selection is good and the potions are small, so its good to order a few and use for sharing among everyone..The pizzas are very nice and they have a good wine selection too

Prego is situated at the Stamford Hotel.
The menu is limited and expensive, food average at best and does not compare with other cheaper priced Italian restaurants.

I made reservations for Sunday brunch buffet ($78++ per pax, without drinks, add $10++ for a cup of coffee/tea per pax, or $30++ for alcohol drinks). It was a unique experience for me because the mains are ordered ala carte, while the appetizers and desserts are buffet style. We only managed to try 6 different mains. The sea bass was good, so was the fried calamari, but you can skip the saffron risotto with scallops - too stodgy. The pork belly reminded me of the Chinese roast pork. I should have tried some of the pastas. The cheese section was good - we liked the camembert and the pecorino. I didn't enjoy the salad bar though. The cured meats and rock melon were splendid. We also had several servings of the fresh seafood (cold boiled prawns, salmon and tuna sashimi, fresh oysters)The desserts were all pretty amazing - loved the tiramisu and the sorbets. They also had a live-singing duo, which could get quite loud and difficult to hear your partner if you're looking to have a conversation. Service was quite attentive and good. Overall,

Prego Singapore has been serving good Italian food for at least 26 years It's one of my favorite places to go whenever I'm yearning for simple Italian fare. You'll love the complimentary bread basket it is serving now as it comes with ricotta cheese and truffled mushrooms. They also have a good selection of antipasti liked bruschetta salmon, Parma ham, mushrooms, artichokes ,etc. I love them all. You can try its lunch or dinner set menus where you'll get a choice of antipasti, pasta/main courses and dessert. I'm a die-hard fan of squid-ink pasta so that's what I usually order. Service wise, I don't remember any bad experiences except for a couple of order blunders with new service staff. On one occasion, I sat next to a female diner who didn't like the food she ordered. The observant waiter offered her a substitute at no cost. That's great service and why I continue to return to this pace. It's difficult to get a last minute reservation on weekends but on several occasions I was given a table as a walk-in customer.

We had originally wanted to go to another restaurant but because we had not made any reservation, being a Friday evening, we were put on the wait list to see if there was any cancellation. After waiting for close to half an hour and no cancellations, we decided to visit Prego at level 1. It was a wonderful decision and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal.We had the chef's recommendation of Prego pizza as well as lamb chop. They were superb! Love the medium lamb chops. Hubby enjoyed the pizza which was good! Though after awhile, the crust was not too crispy as when it was first served

Had Mother's Day dinner at Prego on Sunday, 10th May 2015 with family. We have been having dinner or lunch there for special occasions for the pass 20 years or so but somehow Sunday's dinner failed to excite or met the standards that we had come to expect at Prego. Except for the wine, the food in general was average and though the service and ambiance was above average the overall experience did not match the price paid
5
Was at Prego to celebrate a friend's birthday in Apr15. We tried the ala carte buffet brunch and was amazed at the wide spread of items available on the ala carte menu. The portions served were manageable and we got to try out a good range of food from both the ala carte and buffet spread. Love that they had milk shakes too

The title says it all - the food comes at a price that is disproportionate to its quality. This is not to say that the quality is bad, insofar as it is licit to assess it from one visit only. The caprese salad (mozzarella and tomatoes) I had was quite nice actually. Less so the pizza, with the prosciutto topping having a slightly unusual taste from the one I am accustomed to - but probably my fault for ordering pizzas everywhere in the world after spending the best years of my youth in the home town of pizza. But 40 Singapore dollars was really too much for a pizza, more expensive than most other pizzerias, without a corresponding increase in quality. Nice atmosphere anyway, service ok in my case. In conclusion, not bad but for that price there are probably better options in town

The last time i had Prego's Sunday brunch was around 9 Months back when it was still charging @$68 per pax. It has increased to $78 now. Top up $10 for free flow drinks (non-alcoholic) or $108 for free flow wine. Children (6-12) @$39 each. Firstly, no children friendly food stuff available. Even their pasta bad and bland. Secondly, there were a lot of misses than hits. Ravioli were tough, cooked Salmon tasted unfresh, Foie gras (at $10 extra each) were like rubbed with salt before it was pan fried. Decent stuff were prawns, mushroom soup, ocean trout and gelato. Even the rest of the dessert were pathethic in taste.Service standard was at a new low as you will see servers starting to clear dishes from tables where customers have left and started to set out new plates for the dinner session. This was the period where they will conveniently ignore your calls while they chatted amongst one another while setting up tables. I have a voucher for 50% for up to 6 adults, and i was told children are not applicable as they are enjoying a special price - $39. I don't see how special it was as its the usual practice of half adult pricing. And especially when my nephew had barely a soup + half pasta (small portion) + 2 scoops of gelato. For the adults, thou we tried a lot of the dishes, many were unfinished (not that we like wastage, but it was really bad). The bill came up to $333 for 5 adults and 2 kids. Honestly speaking, it was an afternoon wasted to bad food & service

I've always loved Fairmont Hotels and was very excited when I realised that my friend will be having her birthday dinner at Prego. Good parts:The food was really good. I loved the Squid ink pasta so much. Pizzas and Caprese salad is a must try too.I find their antipasti interesting and very delicious cold cuts. Their desserts are mouth watering! Now let's go to the not so good parts:We ordered Cloudy Bay Sauv Blanc 2013 which is on the wine menu and for some reason, the sommelier in charge served us a 2014 vintage. When we asked why is it 2014 she said 2013 is for the Chardonnay. We let her go and asked for the menu again. ANd guess what, it actually states Sauv Blanc 2013! I think it will be great if the sommelier knows what she's pouring and not argue your way out. If you're out of stock, you can definitely let us know We told one staff to let the sommelier know that she's wrong but she didn't come to apologise personally.Sorry if I sound ranting, but Im pretty sure its very basic to apologise when you're wrong.Waiters weren't as attentive as what I saw from the previous reviews so maybe it's just me :)Overall, I'll come back for the food but my expectations will be low for service

Good Italian Meal on my vacation. Service was great and warm. We had enjoy our meal and my son like a pasta so much.
5
The customer service that we had experienced in Prego was fantastic! The food is also awesome.
I will definitely bring my family & friends to Prego again

Good staff service, medium food quality and cold supermarket atmosphere
Definitely this restaurant isn't an italian pizzeria.
That's all to say

Large Italian dining restaurant at Fairmont Singapore. Haven't been here for a long time so decided to bring the wife here for her Birthday dinner and made use of the FAR card. They have good appetizers in a buffet layout but their best food is the pasta and pizza's. We also had roasted pork belly but I would advise giving that a miss as it is rather dry. The Spaghetti Pescatora has fresh prawns, scallops, calamari, very tasty in tomato sauce based. We also had the Rustica pizza which was sausage, peperoni. Pizza is ok, I think Pete's place at Hyatt is better. Anyways with the FAR card it is a good deal to have. Service was good, very attentive, friendly always smiling. The ambiance wasn't that good, very noisy as the acoustics seems to accentuate the noise generated by the combined chatter

Don't know when did Prego started their Sunday brunch, it was pleasantly good. The appettisers, cold cuts and dessert are layout buffet style while the mains are ordered through a piece of menu. The portion of the mains are small inportion. Good for trying out more dishes. The spread is good for the price. There is a roast corner seving turkey and sirloin on the day I went. There is even live music playing at the background. Priced at $79+

After dining at Equinox the not before, this was a welcome relief for our budget & Credit Card. Great food, great wine, great service, all at a reasonable price. Its hard to find something like this in Singapore.Menu choices are varied & good and the atmosphere / decor is very good.We caught up with friends who had just flown in from the US, who were hungry, but very tired. We were served quickly & food came out quickly, with portion sizes just right. We all left very satisfied & will definitely return for a more extensive mea

Prego is a regular haunt for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids. It is, and has always been, our "go to" restaurant if we were looking for a decent meal outing in a relatively mid-tier and fun setting. The very spacious and brightly lit restaurant is never too cramped nor loud even at its full capacity, unlike many other Italian restaurants here in Singapore.We almost always go for the pasta and pizza dishes for their freshness and use of quality ingredients. Also love the breads and cheese spread they serve -' home-made' probably.Service is always top-notch - warm, friendly and most of all, professional despite the obvious shortage of labour in the restaurants many a times. A special mention to Haziel, who had been looking after us all this while before she moved on to another department.We do use our 1 for 1 American Express Platinum card dining here, and so obviously, it does not seem pricey for a $34 plate of pasta or pizza. If we didn't however, we would also find it too expensive for the kind of food they serve, never mind the portions as well

Went there for Sunday brunch at Noon (started at 12.30, that's lunch?) and as they weren't ready we had to share a three seater coach at reception with about others waiting to go to their table. Why not let us sit at our tables with a glass of water while you get ready. It does state that they start at 12.30 but so what, let us in, we won't start messing up the place! Wouldn't you rather have your diners turn up on time rather than late?After that I had arms folded, bad mood and ready to be a picky guest....however the service staff changed all of that. Such nice people, a young lady from Sth Korea was especially nice. Then the buffet line opened....never seen so much variety....then they gave us a 40 item al la carte menu that was also included in the price!!!, FORTY!!! You could order one of each if you wanted to....amazing! The wine was of good quality and it was easy to get refills during the free flow. The live band was good but I'm glad we were sat quite far away as it was a bit loud. So bad start but great save, football equivalent of being 3-0 down at half time then winning 3-4, cracking result. Just sort your stuck up, unhelpful hosts out, the first and last impression is often the one the guest remembers Myself and my wife, $120 for the food and free flow wine, $80 for food a soft drink

Had a nice dinner with friends at the Prego. All pasta served was fresh, with a nice seasoning (Tested the carbonara and Spagetti Frutti Di Mare), and also the pizzas are very tasteful, but perhaps not the largest single serve pizza in the world. Desserts was also very nice, the tiramisu was flavorful and moist. Price wise, it is a bit high for what they serve, but service is good and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. Perfect for a good bye dinner with our friends
2
Prego has been around for a while - so we were certainly looking forward to our experience here. However, the food was so underwhelming - Veal lacked in taste (although it was grilled almost to perfection), grilled barramundi was bland except for it being a bit salty, roast chicken was also uninteresting (and you don't need to go far to get a roast chicken which tastes much better than this), pizza was pretty ordinary (and expensive: S$35??!!!!) and what saved our meal was the Caesar salad, which was the only decent dish we had here.There are many choices of good restaurants in Singapore, especially Italian. And you are certainly better off somewhere else for a much better experience (better food & value for money)
4
Had a range of pizza and pasta
I had the squid ink which was pretty good. Starters were all very tasty - get the parma ham. Oh and pizza quite large portions so u need to share
4
Good pasta, fish and steak. Solid but not outstanding. Service was a bit lagging as it was quite busy. That being said the staff were attentive and resolved our complaints effectively.
4
generally the pizza is good, pastry are of good value too. Wide selection of wines too. Good choice for romantic dinner or friends gathering!
3
The best part of this popular well located Italian restaurant is its bright, tasteful interiors. However, the pastas me and my friend had was disappointing; being too heavy on the tomato base. Service is friendly and prompt.On a different note, the buffet breakfast is very goo
3
Visited Prego a few times during our recent stay in Singapore and overall the buffet are good with a good selection. It does not differ much from other Pregos around the world and you get what you would expect having tried some of the others. The staff was friendly and attentive but at times also a bit forgetful, we had our drinks mixed up and forgotten at another time. Nevertheless, a decent place with some good food
4
Prego is one of the few restaurants that I will bring my family, friends and clients to. The service is outstanding, never fails me and the food is outstanding. Authentic Italian food coupled with great wine and coffee, it is definitely a place to visit for Italian food if you miss Italy
4
Fantastic atmosphere. Brilliant service. Extensive buffet. The pasta was to die for. Roast beef diasappointingly chewy hence only 4 stars.Very good singers , we sat right next to them but it wasn' t too loud. There was a magician and a brilliant balloon artist.Cost 750 sd for 4adults and a child , good value for Xmas day

I visited Prego many years ago and was disappointed that the current food presented was not up to the standard I enjoyed previously. When we arrived we were made to wait while the counter sort out their " mess" . When I was asked how have you been keeping I didn't know how to react as honestly I don't like to be kept waiting when I have a reservation as it is my son' s birthday.Our service attendant was attentive and polite. The performance by one of the staff throwing the pizza up the air was well received. A small birthday cake was presented quietly as we like it that way.

Prego has been 1 of my must dine when I visit Singapore. I love the zucotto, sea bass, pizza, pasta, almost everything including the stats and the ambiance. Very nice restaurant to be in. Its zucotto can't be found anywhere else.  Love it so much. Often i order for take away, Even when I'm on my way back to airport when i can stop by, i will pack zucotto for take away. Sometimes i was there for tea time alone or with friend or fam. Unfortunately  this Saturday i went there at 4pm  to take it away,  i was told i couldn't ordered it even for takeaway as the restaurant was not operating during afternoon. I traveled from  Orchard especially for the zucotto before i left Singapore.  I asked if they could just help me to go to kitchen and cut the ice cake then pack and i pay n go. No success!  She asked me to go back at 630pm.So sad!

We were deeply disappointed with our dining experience tonight. I used to be a huge fan of this Italian establishment, my first experience back in 2008 was divine. My last two visits were disappointing but somehow the overall experience saved the day. Tonight however, was truly upsetting. 1) I ordered the 4-course dinner set ( 1 appetiser (I selected the Arugula salad), I main(smaller serving- selected the crab linguine) 1 chef's daily special( tonight it was grilled chicken with Tomato sauce) and 1 dessert(selected the choc mousse).Overview:1) Appetiser: was simple and tasty. Good.2) Crab linguine. Bland, cold and pasta wasnt "fresh". Bad.3) Chef's special of Grilled chicken and tomato sauce. Just like airline food. Bad airline food. Bad.4) Choc mousse: Hmmm. Where do I start? Yikez. Bad.My dining companion ordered ala carte Spaghetti Vongole. Again it was bland. When the waiter came to collect the plate, he asked why she hadn't finished her food. So she shared that it was bland, to which he responded - the pasta vongole is the most popular item. Wrong answer. Dude, you gotta listen and provide service recovery ..the plate is 90% uneaten...come on man...Because I just had greens I was still hungry so I ordered a pizza. Bad idea. I'm not sure if it was just me, perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes. Perhaps if I had stuck to my favourites( Eggplant parmigiana, Lasagne or Pizza Margherita) I might have had a more positive experience. Or maybe not. The best things we had tonight were the complimentary bread basket served with truffle butter, two ice cold cans of coke light and a hot TWG peppermint tea. Total bill came up to $180. Thank goodness for Amex so we had a discount. As we left, we both sadly but firmly decided; never again.

The sunday brunch is a must try. It on the expensive side, but due to the huge variety of dishes, its worth it.
4
Amazing buffet breakfast selection that seems to go on for days! The preferred option for us during out three day stay.
5
The breakfast buffet had a very wide range of dishes (more than its competitor Raffles, across the street).
5
Breakfast is a treat here. Although busy, the staff ensure you are seated quickly, and when serving coffee etc, they address you by name! Great system in place. Food options are excellent
5
Woo hoo, what a great treat to have breakfast at Prego.
Nicely tucked between the Fairmont and Swissotel, Prego is worth seeking out for breakfast at this end of town.
3
Had dinner here while staying at the Fairmont. The waiter took forever to take our orders and the service was very average.
Food OK, but try somewhere else!
4
They serve even Aperol Spritz. The concept that you canchoose your appetizer when you enter is interesting, the a la carte menu extensive and the waiters are friendly. They try their best even with European wishes which might seem exotic to them. A nice place for a dinner after a day of shopping.
4
This review is mainly based on the food which Prego served.Good: 1. Anti pastiThe spread was excellent, covering a variety of Anti pasti from meat platters to bruschetta and even sauteed mushrooms. I picked about 5 or 6 different anti pasti and it was all delicious. 2. Pasta/MeatThe pasta portions were relatively sizable for the amount of money paid. It's not the best I've tasted in Singapore but its pretty decent compared to many Italian restaurants. I ordered the Crispy Pork Pancetta as one of my main courses. The pork was juicy and had a nice crunch to the skin. What can be improved:1. PizzaThe pizza was pretty bad. The combination of the biscuit-like crust and the lack of cheese did not appeal to me or my family.2. Pasta qualityAlthough the pastas were decent, Prego can improve its pasta quality by serving noodles that are more Al Dente instead of on the overcooked side. Also, the beef balls on one of the Spaghetti dishes could be made more tender; the ones I ate were pretty darn tough.Overall, the meal was decent. The service was also pretty good for a crowded night, the waiter and waitress who served my table were very patient and always had a cheerful smile on their face. I wouldn't say this restaurant is "very good" but it's definitely above an "average" score; I give this restaurant 3.5 stars instead of a "very good" score if Tripadvisor allowed me to do so
3
This is an attractive restaurant in the Fairmont Hotel complex and we were greeted enthusiastically. It was a Sunday evening and we were jet lagged but in my view the menu and service failed to live up to the Italian decor which had obviously been thought through with the chefs favourite meals on the board etc. if you are looking for authentic this isn't the place in my view. In addition we had to chase the server to refresh the water and this may be a Singapore thing, but they didn't have chilli oil
4
A fine diner with a vibe of a cafe & bar at the Fairmont Singapore. Quite a swanky place for a short business or a start up for a drink or two when you start your evening to continue into the night party hopping. Good selection of wine and other fine spirits.
5
Great ambience and food is good with lovely presentation. Service is excellent as staff are very attentive and quick.
Overall it is worth to go back
3
Ok Italian restaurant - Food was good enough, wine expensive. Wasn't too impressed with the decor. Service was quite good
4
Sunday Brunch was busy with - many choice of varieties of food. Excellent keep going. dislike - many kids at last corner and noisy.
5
The morning buffet was better each day. The service is also very accommodating and friendly. They have a very complete and high quality buffet!!
5
We've eaten at a lot of breakfast buffets all over the world and the one at Prego is one of our favorites ever. There were plenty of choices, as there are on most higher quality buffets, but it was the quality of ingredients and preparation that sets Prego apart. We actually ate at six different hotel buffets while we were on this trip to Asia, and Prego was by far the best. We also had some pastries from their pastry shop, late one night, and they were equally tasty
5
Had a special occassion dinner at Prego despite not staying in the complex but very familiar with the Stamford and Fairmont. The food was very good, mainly had pasta's, yes it is quite expensive but the quality was good. Lots of options to choose from as well as the anti pasto bar. There is also a good wine list with seperate trolley service.Service was a highlight. Erjoy our waitress was extremely attentive yet not pushy, very patient despite a child with allergies on options available and made our experience well. The place filled up more post 7pm and despite other kids it did not seem rowdy as per other comments and we ensure our child is respectful in the surroundings of a restaurant
5
This Restaurant offers a fantastic breakfast buffet. For lunch & dinner, Prego reverts to its core business as an Italian Restaurant. We enjoyed sumptuous pizza and turimasu at Prego. The staff offer great service and the general ambiance makes this restaurant a perfect place to enjoy any meal
2
We had high hopes when we visited this restaurant but it was very disappointing. Although the affetati (charcuterie) we had as a starter was reasonable quality we had to wait over 15 minutes for some artichokes and olives to go with it. I had crab ravioli which was sadly lacking in crab and my husband's lobster ravioli was filled with a minced substance (lobster?) which tasted very strange. The wine, a bottle of pinot grigio was expensive and unremarkable, and the service was very slow
2
For those of you that remember when Prego offered Italian fine dining... this is no longer the same establishment in any way except price. True to the description above, it has become a busy trattoria targeting the bustling tourist trade complete with noisy kids and the din of birthday parties.If it were not for the exceptionally high prices of the main dishes I would probably rate the overall restaurant as fairly average. However for the food quality offered versus the price paid it does not justify that rating.The food itself was on the lower end of average; the tomato-based dishes relying on salt to add flavor, the lobster ravioli served warm with the meat falling out of the likely re-heated pasta. The lasagne was reasonable but entirely forgettable. We decided not to risk the dessert.On a positive note, the service staff did provide some amusement. The girl that led us to our table managed to mix indifference and pride particularly well. Whilst one of the waiters managed to navigate the place half-asleep, only getting shoulder barged once by one of his colleagues. The saving grace was the Filipino male waiter, who in contrast made most of the others look like McDonalds rejects.Still, if you stuck around Raffles City with a craving for Italian at least the place is still passable in an expensive kind of way. P.S. As other reviewers have commented: the half-loaf of bread they serve is $12 and sneakily added to the bill. Which would have been fine is the bread was exceptional enough to be worth that... but sadly it just came across as under-handed
5
I booked online and requested for a good table location as my bf and I will be celebrating his birthday. The food was nice. The staffs were nice and attentive. When we ordered for a slice of cake, I didn't know that they take note of my bf's birthday. They served the tiramisu cake with a candle and was surprised when the staffs sang happy birthday to my bf. My bf looked surprised and happy! Priceless moment :
5
You have to be waited until seated in the morning for breakfast. The choices and variety is just awesome, you find anything you want.
3
If you expect the asian service levels, don't do for Prego. For some reason people look bored and non motivated. Whilst the buffet is truly rich and good you still are not having fun eating here.
4
Excellent menu with an extensive range of culinary choices that are reasonable by hotel standards. Good ambience and helpful staff.
Alcohol was quite expensive and the tables could have used tablecloths or place mats.

We were staying at The Fairmont and it’s a short stroll through reception to get to the entrance of Prego. First impressions were that it was much bigger than we expected (it seats over 200 people) and that the designer had served an apprenticeship modelling American shopping mall food markets. The difference here was the food hanging up decoratively looked real rather than plastic.It has a bustling environment, lots of shoppers from the attached centre grabbing a meal and presumably lots of hotel guests (Fairmont and Stamford Hotels share their restaurants) so it is noisy.Service was over enthusiastic to the point of feeling frantic - we had our main course delivered before we’d finished our starter and all the time we were wary of putting our cutlery down just in case our plates were removed before we’d finished eating.We had three courses and a bottle of wine and our bill came to SG$175 (£86) for two people. It was similar to dining in a chain pizza place in the UK on a larger scale with an even higher mark-up on what are fairly inexpensive base ingredients (pasta and pizza bread). There are many other Italian restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel so I’d possibly research these next time around
5
Dined here on our last night.Wished we had gone there earlier.Meat was from Australia so of course it was the best.I had the Lamb Chops with Red Wine Sauce and Garlic Potatoes and my husband had Steak with Green Pepper Sauce and Mashed potato.it was so good I could have picked up the bones and chewed them.Plenty of bread to start with maybe Goat's Cheese and Olive Tapenade.Do yourself a favour and eat her
3
Having stayed at the Fairmont for ten days this trip, I ate breakfast here six times. They have an excellent choice of juices, ranging from the usual like OJ and apple, but I certainly enjoyed the various mixes they have such as Immune Booster and Refueler.Pastries were also mostly excellent, including the bear claws, pancakes and lychee danish. Some of the hot items were, unfortunately, not hot. An example is the eggs benedict, where the bun/muffin was cold and could hardly be cut with a knife. Perhaps they could vary dishes a little more too - they will change different dim sum, Indian and noodles dishes but these did not vary much in taste.Service here was outstanding. Staff always greet you by name from the second day once they recognise a 'regular'. They were also very helpful and constantly ask if you need a coffee refill etc, even going to the extent of providing a to-go cup. Kudos to them
5
I visit this restaurant for time to time with family/friends when in Singapore, good for after work with co-workers. Also as I stay in the Swissotel the Stamford or the Fairmont sometimes, arriving late evening is no problem to have a meal in this restaurant. It is open until 1 AM I believe, came in I recalled 11PM+ once, and they still served delicious pasta and provided a hot latte to finish the meal :)Still in my top 5 list of Singapore's best restaurants
5
MOUTHWATERING Italian cuisine cooked by cheerful Italian Chef Antonio Facchinetti is de rigeur in this restaurant in the Raffles City complex. The Antipasti selection is outstanding from Bresaola (air dried beef), Bruschetta, Prawns, Salami, Proscuitto di Parma, Parmigiano Cheese, olives and more! Wines here too are very good and not overpriced, From Prosecco sparkling wine to Barolo and Chianti Classico the selections are pleasing. If you like pizzas, they have them too. I like the Ox Heart Tomato with creamy luscious Burrata cheese as well as the Scallops with Asparagus in a tasty yet light sauce. For desserts, there's Tiramisu and Panna Cotta of course and very yummy cakes too. Finish with aromatic Limocello liquer and Espresso coffee! The affable Manager Christian carminetti is also Italian, is very helpful with recommendations. They also have a Delicatessen where you can buy cakes and bread to take home! The atmosphere is lively with a smart casual welcoming decor decorated with wine crates and BIG cheeses! You will also love the mega Sunday Brunch with over 40 differetn dishes served to order a la minute! Buon Appetito!

After having a huge long day in Singapore we just wanted something close by and chose Prego as we were staying in The Fairmont. We ordered the small anti pasta platter, penne carbonara and the pork belly. It was all delicious. We couldn't fault the meals. The waitress we had was fast and friendly and seemed to know that we wanted to eat and go. The only thing I could pick was that it was a bit pricey. But otherwise would absolutely come back
5
Food was delicious, service was great. A bit pricey but couldn't fault it. We had dinner here 1 night (fantastic pizza and pasta) and the best buffet breakfast.They served everything you could imagine but the highlight was the fresh juices (some amazing combinations), omelette station, fresh fruits and the honey from the honeycomb. And I forgot the donuts and pastries - just wow!Would definitely go back
5
Food service and atmosphere all excellent. Decor interesting to look at and produced used available for sale
4
Love the tiramisu and the choc opera cake here!
Have to try the tiramisu served rather than takeaway.
Good selection of take aways cakes.
Simply love it!
5
A marvellous selection of fruit, cereals, pastries and Eastern & Western hot food, all accompanied by excellent and friendly service.
The Strawberry Smoothie is exceptional!

After travelling through Asia for a couple of weeks wanted something different. Stayed at the Fairmont and Prego always had lots of folk who seemed to be enjoying themselves. Restaurant was busy but service was prompt and efficient. Prices similar to want you'd pay for Italian in Australia except wine, like elsewhere in Singapore, is expensive. A good selection of wine by the glass.Food was very tasty. Service was attentive without being intrusive.
4
Took the family out to Prego for Sat lunch. Second visit there. Really enjoyable afternoon- good selection of drinks, sodas and nice starters, ravioli and yummy pizzas...Not much room left for individual puddings but we all shared a Kahlua ice cream which was really good as well. Ariel who served us was excellent taking particular care to look after the needs of our 5 year old- thank you .Will be back
3
Had weekend lunch with my friends and family and decided on the set lunch as it was the most affordable option $49++ for 3-course. From the moment we entered till we left, service was lacklustre. The wait staff were either overwhelmed by the less than full house seating or really inexperienced and not in the mood to work that day. On a separate note, food portions were big though not fantastic, and we were stuffed by the time desserts arrived. I also did mention while making the phone reservations that we were celebrating 2 birthdays on that day and were told that if possible, they can arrange for 2 slices of bday cakes for the bday people. Nothing whatsoever, nor a birthday wish.
3
Went to prego with two friends and thought it was good but not great. I got the scallops to start with which were excellent but my friends got the calamari and cheese board which only looked ok. Main courses of lasagne and pork belly were decent but nothing special, I would go back but maybe try something different
4
A wide selection of Italian classics. Enjoyed the parma ham and rock melon starter. The chef's beef stew was yummy and had a nice beefy taste to it. Tried the Strozzapreti - mixed mushroom, pork sausage in spicy tomato sauce and quite like it. The spaghetti bolognese was adequate but the Tiramisu was a bit too sweet though. The servers were attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Overall, a good place to have dinner
4
I had Risotto Frutti di Mare which was terrific. The server had some serious problems with opening the bottle of wine. First starting to open it by our table and then leaving to avoid embarrassment while he struggled. After about 1,5 minutes he got it open. A bit warm but we got a ice bucket to cool it down right away
4
Staying at The Swissotel Stamford or Fairmont hotel, two breakfast buffet breakfast venue options are available - the Prego (attached to the Fairmont) and the Cafe Swiss. Whilst food choices and service levels are on par and excellent, the Prego is slightly a little more upmarket. Both are recommended
5
Reasonably priced italian food, authentic, thin crusted pizza, al dente pasta, yummy tiramisu.
What more can I ask for?
5
Loved the food, loved the service, but this place is very popular with families and it's really big enough for them to make an effort and seat all the families with small screaming badly behaved children together and let couples and dining adults have a bit of peace. I highly suggest they look into grouping the types of clients coming in, because they really ARE a great restaurant, but the noise of all these huge families ruins your experience... and it's such a shame. Again the food is delicious and great value. The wine as well. And the staff couldn't be nicer! Prego, a Prego Per Favore, partition the place in two....Toddler hell and adult dining.. Thanks

You wont be disappointed visiting Prego if you actually love Italian food, which is delivered by a bunch of energetic, customer-friendly staff. They are very positive, and bubbling with energy all the time.Great varieties of Italian food available on offer, though it may not be the most authentic Italian. Like many other restaurants in Singapore, this is kind an Italian-turned-Singaporean version of food, but definitely not something that you would complain about. More importantly, their service would make you visit them again
5
By far my most favourite restaurant in Singapore. I love it here. Whenever I am in Singapore I tend to live off of Prego. But I don't go just for the food, the staff there are by far, the most absolutely positively wonderful people. They are always so kind and helpful. I love how they interact with customers. They get to know the people they are serving. And not in a cheap attempt to garner tips, but you can tell, the have a genuine interest in getting to know you. I met a good friend of mine while she was working at Prego!The food is so yummy too! The spaghetti bolognese is my go to. Always tastes so fresh and flavourful. The lasagne is a close one for first too! The bread basket always has the most delicious spreads to enjoy on your focaccia or breadsticks. After my meal I always make sure to finish with their tiramisu and a cappuccino. My above listed meal only costs me around $54 SGD. Which isn't bad for the quality you receive!My fiancÃ© also thinks highly of Prego, he enjoys the food and staff there as well. I cannot say anything bad about this place except, there is not more of Prego across Singapore and in Canada! I cannot wait to be back for some more
2
I visited Prego restaurant with family for nice & simple Italian food.The employees tried hard to give good service, but none of them knew too much about Italian food and -being myself Italian- it was for me like ordering Chinese food. Very difficult when I was tryingto order a simple variation on any of the proposal in the menu.Regarding the food in itself, again, this restaurant is managed / run by people not knowing very well the italian cuisine so it was not genuine italian. Hence we were deceived. The scene was nice like a traditional trattoria, but even this was not fantastic as it was very noisy.There is room for a lot of improvement in this restaurant
4
Last night was my fifth visit, with yet another different group of girlfriends.. for a sumptuous dinner. Prego's Italian Restaurant is located at 2 Stamford Road, Level One Fairmont Singapore, Swissotel the Stamford, Singapore 189560 and the number for reservations is 6431 6156. The service is still good and friendly, and the ambience is still laid-back and non-pretentious for a good-class Italian restaurant serving decent Italian fare. Hearty diners crowd the cosy, brightly-lit classic family-style trattoria.The three of us shared three mains - the first being the Tagliolini Al Nero - squid ink tagliolini, roasted tiger prawns, garlic and chilli in tomato sauce. The tagliolini was very springy in texture, and the sapid flavor of sour-sweet tomato was prominent. There were at least five very succulent and fresh tiger prawns, shelled and sweet for us to savor. This was truly a keeper.Next, we had the Penne Tartufate - wild mushrooms and truffle cream sauce. Do not be fooled by the seemingly plain-looking pasta dish - the cream sauce was very delicious and rich, and of course the salient flavor of mushrooms was duly noted. The penne was cooked to a perfect texture that was neither too hard nor soft, as well.

I used to really like the food and service at Pregos but it has definitely gone downhill since its heyday. After being shown to my table (request for window honored - thanks!), I was met with a waiter who would probably be a better fit in McDonalds for his scruffy, can't-be-bothered, rather-be-elsewhere attitude. I ordered the dinner set which came with a starter, pasta, main and dessert. Pasta and main were served within 3 minutes of each other, how they expect you to finish the pasta in such a short amount of time was ridiculous. Mains were left cold before we could start on it. What was more astonishing was that the cutlery and plates used from the starters were never cleared until I had to stop someone who cleared it with a pissy attitude. Please don't bother with this place. Go somewhere else
4
Made a reservation here as its the only one available across the various restaurants that offer buffet within Fairmont & Swissotel. Buffet priced at 68.80 each and includes a wide variety of anti pasti.. cheese, ham, oysters, sashimi, prawns and of course gelato and other desserts. Am happy that staff is more than willing to serve ice water without any charges, unlike other italian joints. There is also a live band in the middle section of the restaurant. Service is pretty swift as well. With the Dining program member (feed at raffles), you get to enjoy your meal at 50% off. The nett bill came up to $80 for 2. Its worth the price tag and comparable to the high tea I had at Rose Verandah( which is another of my fav haunt)
3
Prego used to be really good back in the old days but it was so disappointing when I visited - the food was really lackluster and not worth the price tag. Service was also really bad - server seemed like it was Day 1 for him.
4
This was another remarkable recommendation by the good friend Damien* - after visitng Prego's for the first time, I went back at least thrice with different friends, simply because the Italian food was so good.When one first enters the Italian Trattoria at the posh hotel's level one, they'd be struck by surprise at how simple and unostentatious the decor is - simple wooden furniture and an airy space of vibrant sophistication typical of an authentic Italian restaurant. The genial ambience warms one instantly, and the service crew is always friendly and polite.Passing by the front of the restaurant, there is a huge display of Antipasti to tempt the diners - wide selection of cheese and Italian cured meats. We couldnt resist, and had to select some cheese assortment to kickstart a good, old-fashioned Italian meal.I never understood what the fuss over Prego's bread was, until now. Huge and soft, served with an accompaniment of dips on the table to eat with (the dips consist of basil tomato, ricotta cheese with caramelized onion and ricotta cheese with black truffle) - it was a great start that we polished with relish.Next, the King Prawn Risotto - jumbo marinated king prawns nestled on a bed of bright yellow, richly-flavored stracciatella embracing the delicious arborio rice. The harmony of different flavors was amazing - and the bouncy freshness of the prawns added to the enjoyment of this palatable rice dish.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-pregos-italian-restaurant.htm

Nice delicious Italian food i had here. just 3 days back with my office friends who took me there,Impressive décor and ambience , very good for the corporate outing, service was very good too :)
3
If it's an authentic Italian experience you are seeking, then this is probably not the place. We had dinner at Prego on a few occasions and returned for its Sunday brunch recently. The dinners including wine were pricey and one can easily get better Italian food elsewhere. However the Sunday semi buffet brunch was good value and came with a generous buffet spread of antipasti, lovely cheese, cured meat, juicy oysters, prawn, etc etc ... and oddly salmon and tuna sashimi! We can pick unlimited servings from a selection of 40 downsized mains, but there's no wow factor here. The dessert spread was decent and we enjoyed te tiramisu, rum baba and gelato. For an extra $30, we can have freeflowing wine which is a good deal by Singapore standards. Prego's ambience is large, bright and cheery - more modern European than intimate trattoria - and the service was efficient although the poor staff looked overwhelmed by the high volume during lunch. Overall, the standards need to be raised if Prego wants to be regarded as a truly Italian experience
2
It is very clear this place is a tourist trap. Completely overpriced food aimed at tourists. 40 bucks for a ham pizza, lol. As for pasta, any Italian restaurant where carbonara or bolognese is priced higher than 25 SGD is a complete scam, and this restaurant overcharges for every dish. The food quality is also pretty low, with dry and tasteless pasta dishes being the norm across our table. You can tell the only reason they get people is because of location. Staff is friendly but a couple of the waiters aren't very efficient. So basically, expect school cafeteria-style dishes, in small portions, and way too overpriced.Extremely disappointing, definitely one of the worst Italian restaurants I've been to in Singapore
3
Had lunch with business colleagues at Prego and found the food and service still good. Not wow or great but maintain the standard. Portions were decent. Saw some really nice looking desserts in the counter but did not have the chance to try. Maybe next time. Keep it up
4
We had pizza and salad for lunch - the pizza had lovely fresh ingredients and the classic Caesar salad was well presented and tasty. We opted for tap water and not the bottled water (a good suggestion). The waitor who served us was friendly and helpful - we found all the service to be of a high standard. Although a little pricey it is a convenient option when staying at the local hotels
3
Pleasant enough Italian food with friendly staff centrally located in Singapore but answering the question "still or sparkling" without thinking (I know, I should have said "tap please"), and eating bread that was smilingly placed on my table without being requested added about $25 SGD to my bill! I felt a little bit cheated
3
Dined here with my wife yesterday and they offer semi-buffet lunch on Sundays. We reached 45 minutes prior to their closing time and I guess that explains the staffs' lacklustre service attitude. I will touch on it later but for now, I will explain how the semi-buffet lunch works. Basically, the antipastis and desserts are available in buffet style while the main course has to be ordered from the selection of pastas and meat menu. There is no restrictions to number of main course dishes ordered but there are few dishes that require supplementary charges (marked in the menu). The antipasti section offers green salads, cold-cut meats, pizza, chicken, tuna and seafood salads. I was pretty surprised when I realised that bruschetta and soups are not in the spread! There is also a seafood section offering fresh seafood delicacies such as oysters. The main course includes a huge selection of gnocchi, pastas, risottos and meat dishes. My wife had carbonara (penne) and I had a mushroom fettuccine pasta in creamy truffle sauce. My wife asked for the beacons to be removed from the carbonara so they just served her penne pasta in cream sauce and it looked very pathetic in terms of presentation and portion. My fettuccine pasta was slightly over-cooked but the truffle was delicious. Overall, the pastas were mediocre.The dessert section was excellent. Pistachio pana cotta, 5 flavours of gelato, Tiramisu, cannoli, fruit cakes, strawberry and chocolate mousse cakes, brownies and fresh cut tropical fruits. All of them were lip smacking good. The service was pretty slow. Waiters were busy setting up the restaurant for dinner service and it was hard to get their attention to place our orders. I ended up walking to the drinks counter to place my order. They weren't bothered to attend to the diners when it comes to filling up the water glass or clearing the plates. The drinks were not served on time. They crew definitely need to buck up their service standards. Overall, it's an average Italian semi-buffet lunch which offers excellent desserts at a reasonable price of $80/pax.

Had breakfast here as part of the hotel stay. The staff here are fabulous - always friendly and with a smile, even if it is 7 am in the morning. Another thing I love are the fruit juices, including morning boosters etc. Foodwise, I was slightly disappointed this time. The prata was cooked too early and was very hard - it was difficult to cut it even with a knife. The rice cooker containing the nasi lemak rice was spoilt and threatened to topple over each time someone raised the lid. Usually love the pastries, but found that most of the danishes were too sweet and almost smothered in sugar
3
The food was very nice, nothing special but nice. It is not cheap when you consider it is basically a pizza and pasta restaurant. Be warned though, if you want plain water make sure you ask for a jug of tap water as when they ask if you want sparkling or still they'll charge you $6 (£3) for a small bottle. They'll also put bread on the table and unlike the Cheesecake Factory it's not free, so you'll get charged $12 (£6) whether you eat it or not. I'm happy to pay for what I eat but don't like sneaky charges. The Tiramasu was gorgeous though

We went to to Singapore to have our family vacation there aside from that it was my mom's birthday. We had our dinner there at Prego to celebrate my mom's birthday, and all i can say is everythig is just outstanding! From the food to service it was just outstanding. The manager of the outlet visited our table all the time just to check if everything's fine and we appreciated it. They even gave my mom a wonderful cake to top the celebration of the night. And it was just a great gift for our mom. By the way, that cake that they served was simple but delicious and very refreshing. Thanks for that wonderful night guys.Since we knew that Prego has the Best Breakfast Buffet in Asia, of course we gave it a try. And you can see it from the entrance down to the end of the buffet, there were just tons of dishes to choose from. From American Breakfast, to Asian Breakfast, to fruits, to juices, to cereals, to breads and pastries and more. It was like a breakfast feast right before your eyes!Overall, it was a great experience! This outlet gave us a five star service and since being a part of fairmont, your goal, i suppose is to turn our moment into memories, i 110% assure that Prego was one of those who gave us a memory that can never be forgotten. On behalf of our family, thank you and we'll surely visit again, very soon :
5
Their wide spread and high quality buffet breakfast is a must try if you are staying in Fairmont or visiting Raffles City Shopping Mall.
4
Easily located at the bottom of our hotel and you can't go past pizza and pasta!
A popular restaurant where the service was not only prompt but polite.
By no means is this a top notch fancy restaurant but good honest food as reasonable prices
5
Serving authentic Italian Foods with truly sincere services and very good quality ingredients....Price to pay is NOT an issue...
5
One of the best pizza's I have ever had,divine,all the right things,thin and crispy right amount of cheese and herbs the flavours just make you so satisfied and happy.
4
We Booked into Prego's Christmas Buffet at the last minute and was presently surprised by what they had on offer. The Lunch consisted of nearly every type of food on offer, from roasts, pasta, pizza, seafood, salad, bread, cheese and desert. Everything was immaculately presented and the staff were friendly and helpful..Also had a live band....We took up the offer for free flow alcohol and were extremely happy with the selections and our server who kept it coming.One word of warning is that if you plan on attending note that there will be families and kids moving around at this time of year.... this did not bother us but may some..Excellent and fun choice overall
3
I know, this is an Italian restaurant in Singapore so it was not going to be amazing Italian food, however, I found the food lacking and real quality for the price paid.The Pizza is very expensive at S$38 which works out at £17, I don't even pay that in London. There was a lot of topping, however, because it was mainly vegetables it made the base watery and limp.The total bill for 2 people, we had 1 meat & cheese sharing board, a pizza each and 2 beers each and the bill came to S$200, which worked out just over £100, ridiculous for what we had
2
We visited to try their truffle promotion we saw from the newspaper ad. We enjoyed the appetizer Penne with white truffle. While upon serving the veal we asked 3xwaiters where is the truffles on the dish. We asked 3 because it took time before the staff give an answer. All the staff answered let me check and went inside the kitchen and finally they asked the plate to be return to the chef to fix. They apologized and mentioned it was a miscommunication with the chef. A truffle without a truffle
3
Went with a friend for dinner and we had the dinner special (4 courses, all except for desert slightly smaller portions). Before ordering our food we had some bread and some very tomato / pepper spread, which was very nice, though the first bottle of it part of the glass base fell out, luckily into no food. Everyone very apologetic but that was it, they missed a chance for some good inexpensive PR. The food I enjoyed, started with some scallops in very nice sauce, then a thick spaghetti with Italian sausage, followed by pork belly, nice but a bit light on the crackling, i.e. non existence. My friend felt the Chinese method of cooking pork belly was much better. It was European style. The last course was a tiramisu (seemingly a non alcoholic version), which was okay. All the menu that me and friend had were the chef speciality, so rather disappointing. They did have particularly nice Sardinian red wineOverall the company made the place and I am not sure that without her I would rush back. Pity because it is nice setting
3
Food was nice enough and staff were ok. But it was a bit bland and pricey for what it was. I had the carbonara and it tasted ok, pasta was well cooked, not over done. But there was something missing. It took ages for me to get the attention of someone to get my bill and then they didnt come back with my change. Only S$3 and I was tired so I left it but it was annoying as they already add a service charge. I wouldnt go back
4
Prego has a nice setup.They recommend a reservation and they say they will hold for 15 minutes, and that no doubt would depend on the day and how busy they are.For Sunday brunch/buffet you can relax, listen to live music and choose from quite a few selections.The set up is unlimited appetizers and deserts and choose a main from a menu.The menu is extensive, with some items costing a bit extra(lobster etc). The choices from the menu are a small size and the selections we had were good, but not excellent.The appetizer selections were very good to excellent and deserts were similar. Overall it is a pleasant experience with reasonable prices.If you enjoy Italian and a casual atmosphere, try here
5
We like the variety of the food for their breakast!
Just the jucies, there are more than 10 variety so it's fun to explore!
Then the pastry, we never quite can decide which one to choose from and they all very tasty
4
Great variety offered.
I loved the freshly squeezed fruit juices and smoothies. Staff very friendly and helpful.
4
Great food & ambiance. Service was a little slow but we were informed on arrival that they had a server off sick. It was still however service with a smile & if you're looking for a change from Asian foods this places worth a visit.
4
Prego was a great dining experience. The restaurant was fine (nocwhite cloths) and quiet the wait staff was friendlycand knowledgable. The food was wxcelkent.
5
Our group of nine showed up on a Thursday night without a reservation. At first they could not seat us but with a little pushing we got seated. Then the fun began. My caprese salad was as good as any I have ever had. The cheese was superb. My pizza was also quite enjoyable. Others had pasta and meat dishes and all raved about the food. Not cheap, and of course nothing in Singapore is cheap, but really worth a visit
4
This place has been around since the hotel was booked, so about 25 years. I've been here about 10 times since, and my first review. Decided to return as i had a discount couponStarted with the cured meats and cheese platter, which was quite a delight, since i have bias for prosciutto. My friend and i shared a duck pizza and spicy tomato pasta. The pizza was well made, though the sauce was a tad sweet, the chinese takeout kind. The pasta my friend found too sour, i suspect it was the tomato overload. It was not too badNot sure if we stayed too late past 2pm, but they almost ran out of desserts and only had 2 types left. We weren't keen on either so skipped itService was ok, some waiters better than others. will i be back? Not sure, though i have another coupon ...
5
Had an excellent buffet breakfast at Prego's! The spread was fantastic, especially the wide array of juices. This is a breakfast that has something for every palette. From fruits and juices, to cereals, to hot food - Asian and Western, to cheeses and different types of bread choices... Amazing! Other than the Prata which was a tad hard (probably because it was not freshly made but from frozen dough, but the accompanying curries were authentic), everything was absolutely DELICIOUS. The waiters even obliged with different types of morning coffee and iced tea rather than the usual coffee and tea. Will be going back again definitely
5
Prego has been around for many years in Singapore, and as a regular guest of this very nice Italian restaurant located within the Fairmont Hotel Singapore, I can fully recommend it for breakfast, Sunday brunch, lunch and dinner. It is a big place, but still manages to offer a cosy 'trattoria' like atmosphere with a friendly service, very good food and a very 'laid back, but high quality' ambience. Their menu changes regularly, but the choices for pasta, meats, fish and antipasti dishes as well as pizzas from a wood fired oven are always 'yummy' and the food is of high quality. The ingredients and cooking methods are genuine Italian, and there is a good selection from the 'wine cart' as well. The desserts are dangerously delectable, and I especially love their twists on such classics like pannacotta or tira misu. Prego can be busy on the weekends for Sunday brunch - with big families attending, but the selection is well worth it, and even though this is not a cheap Italian restaurant, it is always value for money. Finally, I have rarely experienced a hotel based restaurant which offers such personal and friendly service to all their guests. Great choice
5
Delicious selection food. Their honey is something out of this world! !! Great service and a big variety of Italian food. Great value for money on their brunch. Definitely recommend it. Cannot wait to be back!!! Make reservation during branch time as it gets quite busy
5
I had breakfast and one dinner at the restaurant, with my friends and we all liked the taste of the cooking here. the service was real quick, and with smiles from the people waiting on us. The ambience is very good and one can get seats near the glass windows where one can look at the people passing by. We relished the Pastas and Cheese and the wines. Delicious food
4
Very authentic Italian food, with a lot of flexibility to make your own dish as you prefer. They make me special pastas by request, even though it is not in the menu :-)
I love this restaurant.
5
The Fairmont Hotel in Singapore has an amazing buffet breakfast restaurant called Prego. It was absolutely amazing with unbelievable variety of delicious foods. If you have the Singapore Airline boarding pass, the hotel honours it with an inclusion of this wonderful buffet for breakfast.
5
The most delicious Rustic Tomoto soup, foccacia bread and Pizza! Excellent with children. Alcohol was extremely expensive though
4
It was my second visit to Prego. Had dinner with an old buddy to catch up on old times. I feel that prego provided the perfect food and ambience for the occasion. Service was really good and friendly, the service staff explaining any queries regarding the menu patiently. We had a bottle of red to go along, perhaps it was the alcohol that added to the relaxed and feel good mood:). We took 2 antipasti - scallops and calamari, with a ravioli to share and had beef tenderloin as mains each. Food quality is good, I like the ravioli especially for its taste and the beef was cooked to perfection. We had their tiramisu as dessert and it was one of the best I had tried. Overall a very nice and enjoyable gathering. Hope to come back again soon
4
Prego is well-located in the Fairmont Hotel, adjoining the Raffles City shopping mall. The standard of the food here is consistently high. In particular, their house bread is soft and pillowy, and is always served warm. Best of all, they offer eggless breads for people who don't take eggs. The bread is usually served with indulgent little bottles of either cream cheese with truffles for vegetarians and anchovies for non-vegetarians. The pizzas are delicious and their pastas and risotto are usually well-prepared. On my last trip, I found the seasoning in my mushroom risotto and spinach ravioli to be lacking, but its nothing a bit of salt and pepper won't fix. Their tiramisu is luscious with generous layers of mascapone cheese and lashings of coffee - I won't have any other dessert here. With a Feed at Raffles Card, one adult is entitled to complimentary dining with a paying card holder
3
There is a lack of character here - but maybe it's for people who want something simple and a little bland. Service was fine but I felt I could have been anywhere in the world. No sense at all of local flavours. Yes it's an Italian in the Far East, but it's lost the flavours of both regions.It didn't help that most of the antipasti had been scored off the list when I'd arrived
1
I had a very nice meal here with my wife three years ago late one evening. This trip, I walked by at mid-afternoon. I was told that only the pizzeria menu was available which was fine with me. I was seated quickly. The restaurant was fairly empty (it was around 4pm) and wait staff were cleaning and resetting tables. I sat quietly trying to get a waiter's attention, but after 15 minutes of being ignored, I simply left. I noticed another guest having difficult getting someone to pay his bill. There were plenty of staff, just no one seemed interested in the guests. A pity
5
lots of western and Asian selection, gourmet and delicious fares. The bakery offers selection of choco cakes good for gifts to Singapore friends. Try to go earlier at 7 30am because it gets a bit crowded later and the quee may be long. Friendly Filipino staff always armed with smiles
3
Said to be the best hotel breakfast around by some private accommodations-reviewer website, I was hoping that the choices would be "unlimited". Been there for breakfast and quite disappointed by the food choices. Taste of the food is good, not great, and the drinks available are the better feature compared to the food. Service is the thing in this restaurant, we were served nicely with a great big smiles from the kitchen staffs and the waiters. Pretty expensive for a breakfast buffet though
2
Between the Fairmont and Swissotel, and part of both. Ersatz Italian environment. Good but over-priced wine list. Pizzas are made with a nice thin base, but the mozzarella was insufficient, and the toppings were just thrown on cold instead of being cooked in the mozzarella. At these prices (SGD 38), you should be able to expect perfection; this was far from it
3
Nice introduction to singapore - huge starter portions, service so so, but clean and good temperature. Relaxing place to chatter.
5
Had breakfast in Prego; amazing range of buffet item for Western and Asian diets, including gluten free; service very welcoming, and food is constantly replenished. Best to get there early as it gets very busy.
4
We stayed at the hotel for four days and ate our breakfast there. Each day, there are different dishes, ranging from smoked salmon to pastries, from eggs benedicts to french toast and pancakes, and local delights such as dim sum and nasi lemak (rice cooked with coconut and eaten with sambal chilli. They even have a fresh fruit juice bar, with various mixes aimed to boost the immune system etc. The restaurant gets packed between 730 and 9 am, but service over the four days was generally quick - they cleared dishes fast. Prego is certainly a good way to start the day
5
We came for a celebration lunch and what a treat it was. We were greeted by the warm lilts of Meryl Jean and LeeYan on the guitar.The service was as gracious as ever and the lunch buffet was superb spread of cold cuts, aged prociutto, and fresh salads. The ala carte buffet was also excellent especially the black tartufo risotto.We finished with the desserts, and usual stuffed ourselves with the tiramisu and torte, which were sublime. Will be back!!
3
Business lunch this week at Prego. Location is central, food is simple but always pretty good, the pizzas in particular are highly recommended. Unfortunately, while the food remains very consistent in a good way, the service is equally consistent in terms of just being lousy. When you get a waiter's attention they're generally helpful but I think the place is under staffed, and not helped by a couple of managers who seemed to simply parade around but do little to help with service - the two of them along with the inability to get waiter attention in a timely fashion is why I've rated it three stars - the food is closer to five stars
5
We had breakfast there most days - beautiful with a wide range of food to suit any taste. The staff were excellent, especially George and Abram. I don't think any of them every lost their smiles.Also had lunch and dinner there occasionally. Again excellent staff, especially Grace. Great food, the tomato soup was divine and the spaghetti bolognaise was wonderful. Would go there anytime I was in Singapore
5
We were recommended to try this place by someone "in the know" and it didn't let us down!The food was amazing, the service was excellent (a rarity in Singapore) and we felt thoroughly satisfied at the end of our evening.I highly recommend this place for great Italian food and excellent service and all for very reasonable prices too
4
Whilst staying at the Fairmont Singapore, Prego was the restaurant for breakfast in the morning. Saturday morning was not too busy and didn't have to wait whilst attending the buffet breakfast. Pork, Tomato and Chicken Sausages, Bacon, Freshly made omelettes available to order. Also available is local Asian cuisine for breakfast, along with pastries, breads, pancakes and waffles. Lots of other things on offer too and well worth a try. Sunday morning was slightly busier but didn't cause too much of a problem
2
If you want to pay outrageous prices for very mediocre Italian food go to prego. The vegetarian menu is minimal - and the food is tasteless and boring. We were highly disappointed and ended up paying $80 for a pizza and pasta (no drinks, desserts or apps!)

We stayed one night at Swissotel Stamford and did a reservation for 7 pax on 5th August for Breakfast. The spread was good and the whole family enjoyed the food and drinks.You can choose from Daily Brew in a coffee/tea pot to Hot Chocolate. Fresh Fruit juices are readily available. Wide spread of Bread and Pastry to choose from and I personally in love with the Waffles and Pancakes.From English to Asian spread for their customers. Very attentive and friendly crews.Thumbs up

I have been a relative regular diner at Prego. The food is amazing and the staff are friendly. Try their buffet lunch. It's simply wonderful.
5
We eat twice in this restaurant as they looked after my wife's wishes and was able to make a pasta dish to suit her needs.
I had meals off the menu which was of good size and most enjoyable.
3
Was surprised when my order of Spagetti Vongole came with tiny clam meats decorated with 6 empty clam shells. Price of $32++ does not justify from tis authentic restaurant. Ambience is beautiful & service is excellent!
5
If you stay at the Fairmont and you get a breakfast package this is the place you go to one of the best breakfasts going around cannot fault it at all it was superb
2
We arrived late at Swissotel, and Prego was one of few restaurants still open. We ordered pizza, but sad to say, it was not very good. Too much cheese, and actually not very tasteful. The service however was good, but prices far too high. If you are heading for pizza, try somewhere else
5
My husband brought me here for my birthday as I loved eating pasta. The food was fantastic. We tried different dishes from pasta, pizza and even their steak. Everything was really delicious! The service was extremely good too as the servers are accommodating and attentive. I was given a free tiramisu which tastes really good too. Because we have the Fairmont card, we were given a 50% off so we would surely be regular customers
4
Prego is one of the best place to dine in Singapore if you are into Italian food. Delicious. If not mistaken, I think they have revamped their menu. Looks different. This time, we ordered Caesar Salad (The best salad that I have ever eaten. A must have everytime I dine in Prego), Salmon, Roasted Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. This place has great ambience and decent service. An area that they should improve is the bill processing. It takes them quite a while to get your bill and process your credit card. You will be left waiting, wondering what happen. This is not the first time that it happen to me
4
tried to make a phone reservation for a considerable amount of time that the phone was either unanswered or engaged. We rang the Fairmont hotel and asked them to connect us through to the restaurant but they couldn't. They said they would get the restaurant to contact us back and confirm bu twe never got a phone call. when we mentioned this to the concierge back at the panpacific hotel, they followed up with it and finally got hold of the restaurant and made our reservation. To me the restaurant doesn't have a lot of atmosphere-I think they have tried to make it some sort of Italian setting but it feels more like a rather impersonal bistro type set up. Two of the blackboard specials were unavailable and 2 of the wines we wanted were not available either. The wine was expensive I felt even for Singapore pricing.The Frescobaldi and the penne were flavoursome and nicely cooked. We shared a seafood pizza with a nice thin crispy base-it was nice but we felt at $35 SGD it was in the upper range of pizza pricing.All in all enjoyable and perhaps would give it another go the next time we were back in Singapor
4
When I heard Prego was having a special Italian cuisine buffet I thought it was too good to be true. I had fantastic set dinners there with my friends but buffet was a first. We ordered our unlimited main courses from a list of 40 pastas as well as meats, and could select our appetizers and desserts from the buffet counters. We had parma ham and various rare and expensive cured meats and cheeses. The desserts were divine. There were also sashimi and sushi which were unusual in a normal Italian spread but were great for variety. And we ended our nice weekend indulgence with freshly brewed expresso, cappucino and latte. Overall, bravo!!
5
We spent 4 days in the Hotel and had breakfast each day at Prego we also enjoyed a great dinner one night.Prego is a large restaurant with visual displays that are italian food orientated well worth a look. But back to the food, the breakfast menu (food) was laid out along the lenghth of the restaurant. So much to choose from something can be found for all tastes, along with fresh juice made while you waited to bacon cooked just right. Waiters served freshly brewed coffee or tea and cleared up promptly. We arrived for tea and were seated promptly the pasta and spaggetti menu is extensive and we selected our meals. The meals arrived promptly without fuss and lived up to my expectations. On the drinks menu there was a Lemon drink which I selected, I was absolutely amazed with this drink it was just great.Overall good place to visit and enjoy dining as it should be.D&
4
Brilliant food, staff, service and starter - warm bread with sour cream, basil or butter. Good portion too!
3
Themed as an Italian, it doubled as breakfast location ( very good choice and service) and cafe. Family friendly, clearly, sensible salads but missing that Italian flare of a market cafe - if that is what it tries to be.
5
We always include breakfast with our stay at the Fairmont as Prego never disappoints. Friendly staff, delicious food and beverages. no better place in my opinion.
4
Went there for lunch with my wife. Didn't have reservation but it was early so was seated quite quickly and what's more at a window seat.Had the grilled tomino cheese and baked eggplant parmigiana. Both were very rich and excellent flavor. The eggplant was warm but could have been served hot, but the tomino was very interesting. First time I had it.Had the strozzapreti pasta with mixed mushrooms and spicy Italian sausages, and special pork belly. The pork belly was a bit porky, might have been overnight but still quite nice. Wife could take it but a bit too porky for me. Skin could have been crispier. But the pasta was excellent.Would come back again, as they have a fairly wide range on the men

The Restaurant has just changed the concept from a traditional Sunday Brunch to a Semi Buffet Lunch about a month ago. There was a huge selections of the main course (40 different dishes in total). It is rare to find a semi buffet lunch has such variety. The guest can enjoy as many main courses as possible ( order at different interval). For the first request you may order up to four main courses (for two guests) and after that you may order more, depend on how good your appetite is. The variety of the salads and deserts were good too. However we found that the juices they offered should be fresh squeezed instead of the concentrated one. Also the soup of the day should put on the buffet table instead of serve on request as not many guests are aware of such item is included in the buffet menu
5
I came here for breakfast for several mornings when I stayed at the Fairmont Singapore but is on the pricey side. There is a lot of options. Cheese, bread, pastries, fruit, typical Asian and Western choices, cold cuts, etc. I liked the variety and really enjoyed the guava juice. Staff were nice and cleared off my empty plates quickly. The food tasted fine.
3
Went here for lunch - ordered a pizza which was tasty but not amazing - at $35 I was expecting more. Not sure what bother going back, service was ok but the waiters weren't overly attentive, forgetting to bring the black pepper etc and the balsamic vinegar I requested never arrived. Would have expected more for an Italian Restaurant
5
A world of bread products awaits you for Prego's breakfast. With donuts, waffles, pancakes, pastries and numerous actual breads, my son loved this place during our stay in the Fairmont. Personally, I thought the choice of juices and fresh fruit were the bonus. Definitely something for everyone. Service was also fantastic. Expensive if not included in room rate, though child prices apply..
4
We checked in late at the Fairmount Hotel so wanted something tasty quick and close to the hotel and found Prego near reception As we were late just a limited menu which was basically pasta or pizza but having one of each both of us found the food really tastyIt's obviously not a genuine Italian restaurant but my pizza came out of a wood fired oven and as I said was really goodStaff very attentive, smiling and friendly, you couldn't fault themMy wife fancied a a cocktail not on the menu but they rustled up a batman and sorted it out Simple tasty and just the job if you check in late, after 10pm then this might fit the bill for yo
4
This traditional Italian cafe serves a wonderful Singaporean/International buffet breakfast. You can experience very good food for lunch or dinner too. This includes delicious desserts, cakes and good coffee. We called in late one evening about 10.30pm and the staff made us great pizzas and ciders. Nothing is too much trouble here.The staff are attentive and obliging. The price is reasonable
5
The title says it all really. Food is still of good quality, service staff are knowledgeable. I didn't have room for dessert, but bought a few sweets on the way out. A perfect experience
4
We ordered the set and was delighted to find the portions are big with a good variety of food. Service was good. Nice place for dinner.
5
We tried the buffet breakfast at Prego and really loved it. It was nice and delicious. Hence, it is strongly recommended.
5
What do you want when you have a full day of sight seeing!!! a good wholesome breakie, and the Prego restaurant has all you can eat, the omelet is just wonderful, so was the french toast, waffles, and a whole heap more, and the cappuccino was hot and creamy, a great way to start your day
5
Prego is definitely one of my favourite place to eat in Singapore. Dine there atleast once a month. Love the food and ambience. Service is quite good as well. I would highly recommend the cod fish, the ceaser salad (the best salad ever in the world for me!), the roasted chicken, pizzas and pasta. Warning : The main course portion is big. A good place to bring your family, visiting friends/relatives and business colleagues

We had previously been to Pregos a few years ago and it was excellent so when we went to Singapore at Christmas we obviously wanted to go back. We got all dressed up because the previous time the restaurant was very posh. When we arrived we were horrified at the change we felt so over dressed. My husband is a chef and has worked in many Italian restaurants and his exact words to the manager was "I don't know how you dare call this authentic italian food". For example he had gnocchi and in all of our travels and working in restaurants neither of us has ever seen gnocchi like that it was disgusting. My son is the pizza king, I think he'd have it every night if he could and he said it was one of the worst pizzas he's ever had. I could go on about the food but I think you get the idea. To say the least I think it is very over priced for what you get. We were sat near big groups so we could hardly hear each other talk. The service was non existent. But, the thing that got us the angriest was when we went on their web site prior to going there it did not state anywhere of the change. To say the least we were hugely disappointed and will not go back when next in Singapore
5
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, located in the Fairmont Hotel at Raffles City. I have never had a bad meal here, and the place has been around for years. The staff are really attentive and the service excellent. By far the best pizza in Singapore but off course there are many other delicious items on the menu. Prego is a hit every-time. Whether you are entertaining clients or just enjoying a meal with family - you will not be disappointed. Whilst I would not call it a terribly romantic setting , my husband and I love to come here. The place is usually buzzing and busy
4
The Prego always looks busy and so I thought I would try it for dinner. I paid $55 Sing for the 4-course set menu and enjoyed it. I would say the food quality is higher than most Italian style restaurants you find in the US. The dishes were well presented and my soup, pasta and fish were expertly cooked. The fish was some of the best I have eaten in Singapore.The staff are very pleasant and the speed of the table service is good. You may have to wait a bit for a table at peak times. A lively and loud environment â€“ the Prego has adopted the unfortunate practice of celebrating birthdays with one of those rambling staff chants. The quieter tables seem to be closer to the entrance of the restaurant. Prego has adopted a "kitchen style" layout for the dining area - so don't expect soft lighting, booths and carpet.I would go there again. I feel the set menu is good value. I did not try the pizza but it looked good
1
If you're looking for good Italian it's not here. I had the main spaghetti pomerdoro and it tasted like canned spaghetti. My children had the kids fish and chips and the fish were fish fingers straight from a box. Hardly authentic Italian. Give it a miss
4
Prego restaurant is at Fairmont Hotel. You are greeted with a friendly and warm welcome and personally escorted to your table. The waiters and waitresses are so friendly and attentive in most occasions we dined. We met the floor manager and he was as Italian as you get and talked with his elaborate hand movements. The food was reasonably priced for the quality of food. It is authentic Italian cuisine cooled by Italians. Their set menu is a bargain but an expensive taste. The ambience takes you back to a local Restaurant in Italy. Worth paying a visit and experiencing
4
Don't order the steak. It's pricey and underwhelming. The pizza on the other hand is fantastic, ask for the hand tossed style for the best experience. Family or couple friendly.
4
Really good menu, good fresh, tasty food, good wine list, excellent service & good help with the menu for someone with a food allergy.
5
I usually have breakfast at Prego - and the variety and quality of food available at this restaurant is delicious. The Pizzas (for lunch/dinner) are also excellent quality!
4
We wanted a quick bite before leaving for the airport and walked past Prego so went in. Service was very good but it was early and not many people in yet. A bit strange at the hostess desk as we had to answer several questions and the answers had to be entered in the computer before we could be seated. As the waitress showed us to the table she explained the antipasto station and we had to use our table number to be served there, looked nice and tempting. We ordered a pizza and it was delicious, not cheap but good. Would have loved to try some other things but time was against us
5
Buffet Breakfast. Excellent selection of hot and cold foods to suit many tastes. Loved the freshly squeezed juices and honey you took directly from a piece of suspended honey comb. Great range of bakery items and the kids loved the donut tower! Friendly, efficient service from the front desk to wait staff. Lovely way to start your day
1
Over the past few years I have been occasional to the Prego. The last time was on Dec 8,2012.Rushing waiter running to the table like there is nothing to order anymore in the next few sec.The atmosphere is also like in a food court, even do they tried to decorate a lot and make it look like a Italian restaurant .Sorry to say never got there.Food, sorry to say, spend you money at McDonalds or KFC you be better off.I had some black coloured pastas (octopuses ink) with tiger prawns.The prevention was ridicules, the tiger prawns boiled in hot water, over cooked and tasteless, the paste sticky to each other, the taste - cat food taste better.My friend had a chicken standing on a device for easy eating, it was not cooked, raw meet on the wings - terrible.Honestly rather don't go there, I will for sure never enter there
4
I loved loved loved the food and the ambience at Prego, Raffles City. The only small detail was that they were a bit slow. i had the squid ink tagliatelle with shrimp and it was divine. great portion. It would be expensive if i had to pay it on my own but as it was a business trip, why not :
2
We stayed at the Fairmont from Nov 28 - Dec 2 and on our last day which was a sunday we decided to partake of their much advertised brunch. We arrived at the restaurant around 11:30am and asked if we can do their brunch. Sorry they said, their brunch opens 12:30 noon. Isn't "brunch" suppose to mean breakfast/lunch? In any case we just walked over to the Equinox and got a superb buffet and a magnificent view of the Marina Bay
4
I used this restaurant to hold my wife's birthday party inviting her friends. We ordered a lunch set (with soup, main and dessert for 42SGD ++ per head for lunch. If you are a AMEX Platinum member and received a half price deal, it would be quite a reasonable price. The atmosphere is adequately lively and spacious. No private room but they can provide seat along partition
3
I went here many times while staying at the Fairmont Hotel, mostly for the buffet breakfast. The Buffet breakfast is extensive and descent but a little pricey at SGD40.I had lunch here a couple of times and it was very quiet and the food was nothing special. There are plenty of better places to eat in the adjacent mall and food court
5
Great buffet breakfast at Fairmont Singapore. Large selection of both asian style and traditional hot breakfast. Great pastries and coffees made for an enjoyable start to the morning. Pleasant staff, cleaning up mess from tables very quickly and offering you top up juices and coffees.
5
Here's one of the places you can have breakfast if staying at the Fairmont. The breakfast buffet is huge! They have anything you can think of. You can have freshly prepared juices with the ingredients you choose. Great place, extraordinary friendly staff.
3
Had a meal here and the service was pretty standard. The prices are high for a very flat food. The music background was crappy songs from the 80s southern europe groups
4
Pasta was great, service was great. Try the pasta that is finished in a wheel of parmesan cheese! Not cheap, but worth it if you want good italian.
5
We dined at Prego twice, dinner and breakfast buffet. All food prepared was of a high standard, the restuarant is spacious and the staff are friendly, polite and cater for each guests requirements.
5
the buffet breakfast was excellent value for money. Great choice of Asian and Western dishes, fresh fruit, pastries and bread. even custom-blended juice. The setting was warm and comfortable with plenty of window seats. The staff were on hand to greet you and most efficient!
5
This is where breakfast is served at the Fairmont. One word only AWESOME. From the staff to the food choice. I will never look at bread the same way again.
5
I tried this restaurant and I found it fantastic. In this place you can find not only "pizza and pasta" but many many original flavour of Italy that you cannot normally find abroad: big selection of imported italian cheese, original prosciutto (ham), salame and mortadella. And these are just few examples...Very good the selection of wines.Price are high but it worth it
5
I loved the organic breakfast, multiple tasty fresh options that my customer and I truly enjoye. I enjoyed watching for the first time the actual bee hive and squezzing the honey out of it.At night, I ordered the parmesan Chef pasta... the chef actually comes to your table and prepare it, at the end he pours the pasta in a huge parmesan block, it was a little bit salty for me but i loved the concept
5
We visited Prego at Fairmont for lunch with our 2 kids on a public holiday. With no reservation, we still got a nice table by the window. Eager to try out our Feed at Raffles membership card which gives us 50% off for 2 adults, 33% off for 3 adults etc, we asked if the kids would be counted as adults. We were told that if they ordered from the kids menu (which they did), we could still enjoy the 50% off since it was just my husband and I. Service was great and attentive, I grabbed 2 magazines from the rack to browse, the meal came with delicious fresh rosemary bread rolls, butter and Ricotta cheese with olive oil/capers. My sandwich was delicious and the kids loved their nuggets, fries & mac n cheese. My husband had saffron pasta and we all had a very pleasant lunch. Good location too, for shopping and dessert after at Raffles City
4
Throughly enjoyed dinner last night at Prego's. The food was great and the service attentive. Try out the set dinner menu as this is value for money. A la carte items are good offering as well. We had a great time.
4
The breakfast here, albeit expensive, is one of the best around. Everything imaginable and really nice lattes.
5
A gastronomic experience with a huge range of breakfast options. Foods presented fresh and to appeal to all tastes.
4
We had a nice lunch at Prego, the appetizer" bar" was a need concept and the food and options very ok
3
Food was good but felt overpriced. Service good. Nothing specular. Average restaurant. Handy when staying at the Fairmont.
3
I liked the presentations, but the food leaves a bit to be desired.The Ceasar salad is not recogizable and the pasta is better described as mexican than italian. The first service request is if I wanted water and yes i did so immediately appears a $12.00 bottle of water. This came in handy later when the pasta started my eyes watering.Wine was good and antipasta good but very over priced.It seemed like a group is beter served than a single
4
We have just come back from a 5 day stay at the fairmont singapore where prego is held. We had a buffet breakfast in there every morning so can only comment on that. The staff are friendly and got to know our names. There was a lot of choice but not so much for the cooked (typically english) breakfasts. There were currys and similar things which i saw other people have. There was someone do do omelet's etc and someone for juices. I was a bit bored after 4 days. Have heard that there is dress code for evenings
3
Prego is in the Fairmont Singapore in Raffles City and has good Italian deli atmosphere complete with hams and cheeses hanging from the ceiling and an antipasti bar. The staff is very friendly and helpful and service is prompt and efficient. They cater to families too with a chef coming out to flip pizza dough for the kids.The pasta was great - I had a dish with mushroom and spicy sausage in tomato sauce and a prosciutto broschetta to start. My only complaints are the pasta serving was rather small even though it is served in a very large bowl - and I noticed the same thing at the table next to me, however the ceasar salad at another table filled the bowl completely.The wines were a bit on the expensive side and they didn't bring a wine list for the wines by the glass. The waiter just suggested something based on my preferences, which were wonderful, and a decent pour in the glass, but I got a bit of sticker shock when I got the final bill (one glass was $23).So overall - a bit pricey for what you get although the flavour is there. Just do yourself a favour and ask to see the wine list for wines by the glass before ordering
4
Arrived very late in Singapore and was looking for a quick bite to eat. This place footed the bill perfectly. Service was efficient and friendly. Does very good food and quite reasonably priced given that it's next door to Raffles. Also went here a couple of times for breakfast and the experience was just as good.
2
My wife and I went along for what we hoped would be a nice dinner as she fancied some Italian food as a break from Asian which we've had a lot on this holiday. Unfortunately, Prego turned out to be pretty disappointing. The decor and ambience set the place off to a great start - it really does look the part and the antipasti bar looks really good. Having had a reasonably decent sized lunch, we decided we only wanted a main course and possibly a dessert. We started with some bread which we were offered to start with which was pretty doughy and undercooked - I would suggest declining the offer of bread. My wife had a pizza Diavola which really was good, however my pappardelle with meatballs really was not. I like a bit of home cooking and make a decent meatballs dish and have eaten several very good meatballs in various Italian restaurants - these however were bland and uninspiring and the tomato sauce lacked the depth of flavour I'd expect from a good Italian. The wine trolley was, however, a really nice touch with my wife having a couple of glasses with her pizza, while I stuck with Tiger beer which was on buy one get one free. Having had an ok-ish evening, we asked for the bill planning to have coffee and cake in the lovely lobby bar of the Swissotel, but were amazed when we saw our dinner had cost us SG$153!!! We both like the finer things in life and like to eat in good restaurants and have no issue with paying for a really good meal, but I honestly felt like I'd been robbed blind!! Just the previous night, we'd had a real banquet of dim sum, noodles, beer and wine and were both stuffed all for SG$100, and after Prego I was left feeling hungry, unimpressed, and bewildered at how I just thrown 75 quid away. If you like pizza then worth it and the antipasti bar looked worth a try - who knows, given some of the other views here it looks like a lot of the other dishes were probably very good, so it may have been ad luck for us on the night. All I know is it was enough to turn me off going back again but it may others will have better luck than we did
4
Most incredible breakfast spread I have ever seen... but at SGD$55 I'd rather do other things for my money!!
5
A wonderful meal, couldn't fault the food (we tried and shared a little bit of everything - we were full!), and the service was attentive. We had an enjoyable evening celebrating our anniversary, and wouldn't hesitate to go back again for a meal with friends.
4
Had both breakfast and a dinner buffet here whilst staying at the Fairmont hotel. Both excellent, although lots of other dining options nearby just as good if not better.
5
nice place to go, with good italian food and ambiance. recommend it, but not that much value for money as its in a hotel. so places outside may be cheaper with eh same or better quality.
4
Had breakfast buffet here, several times while staying again at the Fairmont hotel. Very crowded, but somehow, the layout & service handles this extremely well. Staff very courteous. Special mention to a young man, "Jame", who was attentive, & even remembered our names, & coffee preferences...being in a service industry myself, I observe customer service experience closely, & Jame was a standout star, among the other staff who were all very professional.The food represented a vast arrange, & i would rate even better than Shangri-la in Sydney (a benchmark in my view). Huge range of western, chinese, Malayasian, Indian, vast freshly squeezed fruits, cereals (can be difficult sometimes to get cereals at breakfast ifferings in S'pore). Their grannola wss one of the best I have tasted. Very relaxed ambience, set in an Italian themed venue. Our breakfast buffet was complimentary with our Fairmont booking. We have also experienced the other hotel offering, "Alligator Pear", & We believe Prego is a superior option
4
It has been a while since we visited Prego and so we decided to come back for brunch. After all these years, they still delivered!. Starter :Minestrone soup , it was refreshing and delicious. Their Bruschetta was not bad either.Main : Lobster Risotto , cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.Must admit it was not cheap, but worth the visit :). Nice place for Sunday brunch 
5
I had the minestrone soup and a red garden pasta, which were delicious. The server was friendly and professional, and everything was delivered in a timely manner. The complimentary foccacia bread came with an amazing spread, and they should be enjoyed together. This was not a cheap meal, but it was well worth it
5
It had been awhile since we last met. We contemplated where to go and I decided to go for the tried and tested.I have been patronizing Prego for quite some time and it has never failed me. The ambience and atmosphere was casual and not the least bit stifling. The Italian restaurant has gone through numerous changes, and it has to in order to keep up with today's discerning taste buds.The mushroom soup was delicious, no chunky bits of mushrooms this soup had but fine bits, as befitting a first course. The rotisserie chicken was better presented and tastier the last time I was there. It was a little tough and could do with a thicker layer of gravy.Of course, what would Italian fare be without tiramisu, and Prego has one of the best ever.It was a good combination of old friends and good food. I could not have asked for anything more
4
Decided to eat here on the last night of our holiday to Singapore, there is a good selection of standard Italian fair to choose from on the menu although as the restaurant is part of a 5 star hotel prices are a little on the high side. We had calamari and mussels in white wine to start the portion size was generous and it all tasted good, we shared it between 3 of us. The main courses were a little hit and miss squid ink pasta with prawns was very good and the tagliatelle with meat balls also tasted good however 3 small meat balls for a main course seems a little bit stingy to me however the real disapointmant was the steak which was bland and under seasoned. Desserts were nice especially the tiramisu although we had to wait a while as the restaurant was very busy and the wait staff struggled to cope with the amount people that were there.The food was nice enough but you will find better in Singapor
4
I've been coming here since it first opened. There been a change with the new owners and as with everything, it will never be the same. Don't get me wrong this uz not a criticism. Anyhow, the food is good and the management (guys in blue suits) is attentive. Staff need a nudge every now and then but this is Singapore. Certainly I would recommend this restaurant for an Italian-Singapore experience
3
This is on the ground floor and is ok but not exceptional. A bit pricey as well.
2
I used to enjoy the Italian pasta at Prego. But at my last visit, I found the quality of the food has fallen.
3
The food was tasty, but didn't warrant the overly aggressive price.
3
This is a nicely done up place with amazing dessert. But the pasta and pizza was pretty average.
4
Really a nice treat in Singapore. Good service and a nice ambiance.
4
The breakfast was good- ingredients fresh - for instance the juice or the milk. The ambience was very lively. Seating is good and staff is very nice- though I wonder why they all have earpiece. Pity never got to try their Italian
5
This restaurant is rather expensive but the food is traditional Italian fare and the service is excellent. The pasta tastes like home-cooked food from a trattoria.
5
Our first experience at this resturant. We had prompt service with very helpful staff. I have food allergies and the staff were very helpful with menu selection. The food was melt in the mouth. While we were there they had a tomato promotion - the soup was the best I have tasted, not sure about the tomato sorbet though. The menu is excellent - not only tomato, but suitable for all tastes. Will definietly eat there agai
4
Another family fav, but mine personally for the crab pasta. Its the one thing i order every time. The Asian staff are very good. They usually talk to the kids and are attentive to their needs. During 1 of our visits my daughter fell asleep at the table, her food arrive, instead of just placing it at the table, the waiter asked if she was going to dine with us, otherwise he will bring the food back to the kitchen and prepare a fresh plate when she is ready...what can i say. Reservations encouraged. i think i need my crab pasta fix this weekend
5
Went to prego for a friend's 21st birthday! Although it was really pricey, we managed to get a 'discount' as we bought vouchers from the changirecommends website so with every 100 spent, we only paid $73. the desserts, especially tiramisu are just awesome!!! great service, food and at a more affordable price, definitely a must-tr
5
Great Italian restaurant, food and service were excellent, highly recommend this place
4
Prego has been in Singapore for more than 20 years and it's menu is fresh and fun. Kudos to the corporate chef who sets the pace and keeps it new, fun and fresh! Miss the late night discounts at the bakery counter though! :)
4
I really like the ambience, the attention to detail, the service as well as the food here. It's really delicious. Even the hotel staff prefer to entertain their clients here.
3
Pretty good food for a decent price. No a la carte on Sundays.
5
Service was great right from the reception. Restaurant is spacious. Not huge with variety but their is also their set menu which changes monthly. Serving is quite generous and for an Asian lady, i usually have to share one portion. If it is possible (group sharing?), try their soup, mussels and definitely their pasta! If you are not a pasta fan, their fish is always made spot on. Fresh bread and special cheese concoction is always served right after you order. Albeit a little pricey but for the portion and quality. Definitely worth the money. Remember to make reservations
3
We were blown away by the prices of a pizza - 34 S$!! We shared one and also a mozzarella salad and both were average. Atmosphere was ok and service was actually fairly nice. So if you are tired from your trip and would like something quick and simple, this is an ok place. Otherwise, I would not really recommend it

One of the best assortments for a breakfast buffet. The selection of breads alone is amazing. The French press coffee is rich and strong. If you go avoid the a la carte option. It is a bit cheaper than the general buffet but the service is quite slow. We waited for over 30 minutes for an omelet. The next day, we did the buffet option and got our omelets in 2 minutes flat.

This restaurant is in the Fairmont Hotel. It is decorated to feel like you are in a Tuscan pizzeria. The menu is interesting and the food is well prepared. I had a Caesar Salad and a Thin Crust pizza. Both were elegantly presented but fundamentally lacked flavor. There was nothing wrong but they were bland.Service was good and prices on the high side
4
As with a few things with Singapore, Prego has changed since our first visit. On our first visit to the Restaurant, we were bowled over by the atmosphere; the menu and of course, the food. Obviously on this latest trip, we were expecting the same experience. Although the prices have remained very high, the menu is more of a cafe's menu. At those prices, one would expect more than received.HOWEVER - we can highly recommend the pizza. The pizza although super, super thin, was extremely tasty!
5
Breakfast at Prego was included in my Exec Club room rate. Excellent buffet! Everything from made to order omelets, french toast, dumplings, noodles, Indian dishes, lox and bagels, etc. If you're staying at the Fairmont, opt for the Exec Club room rate to get a better deal on breakfast here
3
Weekend lunch is now restricted to buffett @ $80 per head. Too pricey. Looking at the a-la-carte menu, the cheapest dish is around $20 or the cheapest pizza @ $37 each is ridiculously expensive.... very disappointing as great italian food should not be overpriced.
3
Great ambiance, good selection of traditional Italian meals and quality is spot on. A little on the pricey side, but you wont be disappointed.
5
Good service, lovely food. A nice atmosphere with a good vibe. Busy, so book in advance.
5
we had breakfast here every morning whilst staying at the Fairmont, it was wonderful great food and lovely staff, nothing too much trouble and I always asked for a coffee to go
4
Nothing to right home about food acceptable but like anywhere in Singapore it is expensive.Good location to the Swissotel Stamford.Staff very friendly.
3
For a hotel F & B outlet that has survived several owners since the beginning and gone through so many facelifts, I'm still not seeing this as a great place to eat. Only saving grace is the service, which is only standard, not exceptional.
4
Very nice restaurant, Staff were lovely. However I found the atmosphere a little pretentious for a pizza restaurant.
2
Have been going for years until maybe about 2 years ago we stopped going because the food just got really lousy and over priced. Tried again in January after a haitus of 1 to 2 years - food is a little better than before (at its worst) but at the prices they are charging, you can do alot better at the newer and smaller places.

My family and I went to Prego as scheduled as this restuarant is centrally located. We arrived first and waited for a while before being shown to our table. None of the waiters there attended to us though they knew our presence as we were the first to arrived at the restaurant at the appointed time. About another 10 min, a young couple came and TWO waiters attended to them immediately, and served them drinks. We had to ask the waiters to serve us drinks before they would.When looking at the menu for the Restaurant week which was layed on the table, we saw that the main course is Beef. We immediately informed one of the waiter that due to our reglion we do not take beef and asked if we could be served chicken or fish as main course. He went to check and get back to us that we can only choose pasta and that we have to pay another S$10++ per pax. I informed him that I do not like pasta, and was informed that I could look at the normal menu of which I have to pay the normal price.This episode really spoil our mood of celebrating the evening that we just had to leave Prego with a lousy feelings for the two, seemed to be untrained, waiters, and a restaurant that ONLY OFFER BEEF as their main course knowing that Singapore is a multi-racial, multi religions country! I should have trusted the reviews of other guests who have patronised.We will never ever stepped into Prego for sure
4
We ate here a few times while in Singapore. After weeks of Asian food, we found their pasta dishes with fresh parmagiano really hit the spot as did their Italian country decor. Now I want you to understand that we REALLY like Asian food, but everyone needs a change now and then. We also enjoyed being pampered by their staff. As the oldest of their clientele, we must have caught their attention, and we quite enjoyed it:
5
Prego makes the best pizza in Singapore as well as having a great selection of antipasti to enjoy before. They have a decently priced selection of wines by the glass and service is a cut above the norm. You won't be disappointed.
5
Eat breakfast at the Hotel - an awesome breakfast and a really good deal
4
Breakfast for Fairmont served in the mornings at this Italian restaurant. Very good and plentiful array of foods for all tastes and nationalities. We included breakfast with room price for a better deal.
5
great food, excellent service. I love this place. its a little expensive if you compare it to other Italian restaurants. but it worth the money
4
Right in the heart of the city, good food and quick service
4
Good food, fresh produce, nice wines and great service.
5
This restaurant is across the road from Raffles on the ground floor of the Fairmont Hotel. The decor is really authentic and you immediately know that the food will match. Certainly it came up to our expectations. Try the chefs special bruschettas, they are tasty snacks and have a variety of fillings - in fact at lunchtime you could make a meal of them with a glass or two of wine, I had caeser saled for starters and it was one of the best I have tasted, as was the rest of the meal. We called back for a meal 7 weeks later when passing through coming back to the UK from Australia and the quality was just the same
4
Had lunch there with my mom and my sister during the last trip and was so impressed with our waiter Lester that I wrote in to the GM to highlight his outstanding service. That this was not Lester's first commendation underlines the restaurant's high level of service. The food is good, and it also doubles up as the breakfast provider for Fairmont Hotel guests. Reservations (concierge can help) are recommended, particularly for lunch when it gets quite crowded. Ask for the window seats if possible
1
Food was terrible (even their so called popular dishes). I think the chefs need to taste what REAL ITALIAN food is like before they start blowing their own trumpets about their dishes. Not ever going back (and I've been asked by Hotel Management to return) ... very very disappointed
2
Went here on a Monday night with two colleagues, and we were looking forward to great Italian food. Unfortunately, while the food was ok, it was not worth the poor service or the cost. Specifically, to place our order we had to wait over ten minutes. Once the meal was delivered we literally never saw a server again. I had to eventually track down the hostess to ask for my check.At $35 per pasta plate, we expected more. I would not recommend unless you're extremely patient and want to pay for over-priced Italian fare.
4
Pls go for the set lunch... More value for money than to order individually... Must have dessert: Tiramisu
5
Excellent smorgasboard Breakfast to suit all tastes and cultures
4
Large- ( not Boutique!) but pleasant , good service , and nice food.
5
I've eaten in the restaurant several times. It's hotel prices essentially but quaility of the food is good and service excellent. It's a restaurant for a "treat".
5
The restaurant has been refurbished. Very nice rustic and residential feel. One of my favourite.
4
+ good quality Italian food, easy to reach location
- pricey for what it is
4
Service was good. The food was great. Prices are high though.
5
Best service, the staffs are attentive and they brightens up the place. They are doing a wonderful job to please the customers. Food is good especially the freshly baked bread that they serve, which goes well with the olive oil or garnish. Pricing on the average but I don't mind to return again, which I did. Now they even recognised me and addressed me by my name. Such a pleasant experience
4
Since we always stay in Fairmont Hotel, we always have our breakfasts here, since 10 years ago. Today, the restaurant is refurbished, with new decorations and long counters for Fruits, Pastries, Cheese, Beverages and the 'Egg station'The variety for each of the food and beverages are beyond my expectiation. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, try having your breakfast here, and request for a table by the window.The cleanliness and service from the waiters are excellent. So far, we don't have any bad memories in this restaurant
4
Good food, convenient to Fairmont, but there are a ton of options very close by. Breakfast was really expensive and there is a mall attached to the building w/ many other options. I liked it, and actually had a few meals there for business, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there...not in Singapore, so much great food there
5
Staff at prego was o.u.t.s.t.a.n.d.i.n.g!!!!! I did eat there for 5 weeks straight and after a few days, the people there almost knew me by heart. Outstanding service, couldn't ask for more!
4
the mussell in marinara sauce was fantastic. The hawaiian pizza was zapped up by the kids in no time. Tiramisu was slightly hard (I preferred the softer type) Overall ambience is good for family dinner.
5
The food is great.The chicken is very nice to eat it is like there is some BBQ sauce on top The desert is very nice to eat like:the mud pie is huge but we manage to finish it all Yummy ...........The tiramisu cake is the best i had taste in my lif
3
The place is very bright and not warm and welcoming.Food is average at best and even at 6pm they did not have any beef carpaccio? Service was very middle of the road and the cost was quite high given the quality. Wine list is quite good but price
4
Good food, good service, good ambience. That's the secret of success when it comes to restaurants and Prego, the Italian restaurant has it all in equal measure. 5 people at lunch and everyone very happy with their food. That's as good as it can get. The warm ciabatta served with a dip made of finely chopped green olives resting on a bed of Ricotta set the tone of the meal. The only disappointment was the Calamari. Crispy fried Calamari (what we ordered) should be delicate little rings that are evenly coated with batter. These were doorsteps. Thick, chewy, inedible. In a really good restaurant, the staff are trained to ask you if there is a problem, when they see you have left most of the food. These guys were not concerned. The Mango cake that we had to round off the meal and a perfect cup of expresso, dark, dense and packed with rich flavor made up for the squishy squid. If you are in the vicinity drop in but no need to cross town
4
I am staying in the fairmont hotel and used the prego restraint for breakfast today, I can only praise the service, quality of food and just overall feel of the place. Me and my family were made to feel extremely welcome we were shown all the breakfast options and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.Well done Prego, really impresse
4
I love their Spinach and tuna salad, scrumptious! Boyfriend loves their Pizza Margherita. Pity they changed the starter round bread with tomato dipping to some donut shape bread with some sort of cheese dipping. I also like their vegetarian lasagna and ohh, they have the loveliest pasta choices, ever
3
We had a lunch in Prego, just some pasta and a pizza, which was quite below an average italian pizza but were then quite surprised about the overall amount on the bill. Even we understand the costs for food and beverage are high in Singapore but this place is not offering value for money. This refers to the quality of the food. The service itself was good, service staff is very friendly and helpful
4
A good choice for Italian food in a good location in singapore - the prices are accordingly extortionate. However, if you are desperate for italian, it is ok with good service. Prego's staff will be very patient with you as you try a sip of every kind of wine before u buy. Great atmosphere
5
I have been to this restaurant a few times started with a gathering with my friends. The specialty of this restraurant is its Italian delicacy and it serves authentic Italian recipe.The uniqueness of this restaurant is the that right after loading your orders, there come a coth made bag holding a loaf of bread, diners would pinch pieces of the bread, dip into olive oil with salt and pepper before putting into their mouth. The warm of the bread added with fragance of the olive oil, taste of saltiness and stimulus of black pepper definitely want you to take more. There is never enough bread to go around.Of course, when come to the main course, the erving portion is enough to fill the stomach while tasting fabulous.the restaurant is (be warn) slightly on the high side when come to billing, after all, it is part of the five star hotel service.
5
Great breakfast option if staying at the Fairmont, great choice of local and international food.
4
Nothing fussy, just good food, excellent staff and a very wide choice whether you want Italian or the wide range of cuisines available for the buffet breakfast. The Indian breakfast - for Dewali - was very flavoursome, more time in gym as a result !
4
Loved the meatball and linguine, washed down with a glass of Merlot.
5
We selected this restaurant out of curiosity, expecting it to be a snobby and costly dining restaurant as it is part of a hotel, downtown Singapore. Amazingly, we had such a warm and charming dining experience, especially with the attention and care given to us by the service staff, Lester. He made my friend's birthday all the more special. Note: the staff was not even aware that it was her birthday. Kudos to this restaurant
4
I went there for lunch with colleagues and found the food was good. The ministrone soup was a tad bland, but the pasta was spicy and tangy. The portions were very good too. The Tiramisu was quite good, soft, fluffy and not overtly sweet. Good place. The restaurant also keeps serving hot bread, nicely toasted. The tables are a bit cramped though
4
From the moment we walked onto Prego to the time we left, we were treated so well. I was out for a celebratory dinner with friends and could not have asked for a nicer evening. we stared with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot Rose, my pink champers. The maitre d' the restaurant made sure that we were to have our bubble very cold and would not pour it before it was EXTRA chilled! ! We enjoyed some tapas-styled Italian appetizers- shrimp a la yum yum! A bagel-looking rosemary bread was served before dinner with the flavourful oil and balsamic vinegar. The food was tasty and the waiter made sure we were having a good time. The atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed, yet quite nice. the meal ended with a room full of Italians and those who were just Italian for the night singing me "Happy Birthday" ..and happy it was! Thank you
5
Luv this place! just try it out+ breakfast is a must have here.. I generally tend to skip lunch aftr the bf.. I am a fan if Italian food n dnt mind eating absolutely anything here... Sinc I stay in fairmont I tend to eat here and hence the constant appearances here...
4
After many years we wanted to see how Prego is doing. The only difference we could spot was the staff. As in so many Singapore restaurants the cost cutting is obviously the issue. The waiters and waitresses although there were plenty of them were not up to the standard. On a positive note they were friendly and got the bill right. We ordered set dinner (S$55 per person, with tax and service charge S$64.74). The salad was fresh with dash of olive oil and lemon. The small bowl of spagetti was delicious and the main course, Cod fish, was great. Tiramisu was not as good, but still ok. Overall a pleasurable experience. Of course it is everyone's own judgment whether $64 is too much, but the place is nice and you don't get too often such a nice piece of cod
2
Both my husband and I ordered a main course of steak. We asked for it to be cooked Medium but when the first steaks were brought to the table they were rare...almost blue. We told the waiter we were not happy and that these were definately not medium. He apologised and returned with another 2 steaks, this time my husbands was cooked medium but again my steak was almost raw. I couldn't believe that the chef would send this out when he knew that we had complained about the first one. I asked the waiter if I could speak to the Manager but I was told 'he's in a meeting'. A restaurant manager who is in a meeting during dinner service in a busy restaurant...its unbelievable. The waiter was apologetic and offered us a free main but I was quite over it by this stage and my husband had nearly finished his meal. The subsequent offer of free dessert and Grappa were not taken up by us as we just wanted to get out of there. Its a shame when a chef lets the team down and the Manager is not interested in valuable feedback. I felt like it was a case of 'just offer them free food and get rid of them". I definately won't go back
4
NIce cosy place for a quiet dinner after a hard days work. The service is good and food is great. Presentation is great too.However, the menu is limited. The cakes are great especially the chocolate based ones. Don't forget to try the breads too, they are freshly baked and great just eating it plain
4
The waiters are very friendly and the food there is very nice.It also has a nice atmosphere.I usually go there for nice carbonara and lagsane. However,they have raised their price so I don't go there often any more!
4
Nice cosy Italian with well cooked food.
4
Very nice pasta
2
Service was really slow. Food was served almost an hour after we ordered, inspite of checking with the staff and assurance that order is already on its way. Some staff seems to be not familiar with the restaurant's offering! Food was good but not that spectacular. Quite pricey for "ok" food and unprofessional service. Gone was the Prego we used to love
3
Have been going to Prego for ages now. Its always been a special place for great Italian fare in Singapore. The last couple of visits has somewhat not met my expectations, forget exceeding them. The staff are great, quick service. The food quaity seems to have fallen 1-2 notches which is very dissappointing. I still think they have the best thin crust pizza's though. It has become expensive to dine here, but then again most 5 star hotel restaurants have put up prices, just like they have done for sleeping rooms. will personally commence my search to look for a better Italian place now
4
If you are looking to dine in an upmarket restaurant right in the heart of Singapore, look no further than Prego.It's been around for around 2 decades. The last time I dined here was probably 8 years ago. Seriously, I doubt I can remember what I ate the last time, and how the food tasted. What I remember was paying a tidy sum for a meal.This has not changed. I had dinner with two friends this evening. We were attended to by a sweet young lady, whose smile definitely brought cheer to the table, when she took down our orders, and whenever she swung by our table to serve us our main courses and desserts.The set dinner consisting of terrine, pasta, main course and dessert will set you back by SGD50. I ordered the Cod Fish (Merluzzo alForno) (SGD36). I enjoyed the freshness of the fish. What's surprising was the generous slab of flesh, which I am unaccustomed to in a high-end Western restaurant in Singapore. Just for your information: Main courses start from SGD34. So if you are planning to have a good meal, please come prepared with a fat wallet

I've been to this restaurant in the 90's when the hotel was Westin and I ate the best tiramisu of my life. I've returned here in 2008 and the food was not so good and the tiramisu was nothing to die for. This month we went there again and I found it to be quite expensive. We went for dinner and it was quite full. After we had a table and choose the food it take a lot of time for it to arrive and bread arrived with food. My daughter ate their kids menu spaghetti bolognese and she said it was ok. My son liked the lasagna (normal size as kid size is too small for him). I ate some ravioli with pumpkin that has a nice flavor but looked too litle for the price we were paying. My husband ordered the pantalone and he was very dissapointed as it was not inflated and it was cold inside.My son and my daughter ordered one ball of ice cream for each of them and I ordered the tiramisu. It took a long time for the first ball of ice cream to be served and we asked for the other one that took a litle more. Then, as my tiramisu wasn't served I ask why it took so long and it was then that we saw that the waiter had forgotten it and was adding it to our bill. It did arrived, not as special as before but still ok, but SGD16!!!All the drinks were very expensive also, and for 4 persons (3 adult size plus one kid meal with drinks -non alcool) we paid SGD185.I will think twice bwfore going there again..

Back in the 90's, this was a wonderful restuarant. I said as much to the manager as I waited, with my family, to be shown a table. He assured us that though the kitchen staff had changed many times over the years, he had insisted on maintaining the quality of food and service.We ordered. Bruschetta for starters, a junior pizza for youngest daughter, penne for our 11 year old. For mum and dad, our Prego favourite- a pantalone pizza, now at S$27.00.Soft drinks for the girls, a French chardonnay for dad, an Italian sauvignon blanc for mum. Just a glass each, S$12 for the former, S$13 for the latter.The wine arrived first. A small 20ml shot for tasting and upon approval, a miniscule 100ml added. Being too timid to complain of the small puddle at the bottom of the glass, we accepted the small serving assuming it would be topped up to the same level once we had consumed the first serve.Why are we so silly?The Bruschetta arrived....three rather small triangles of rather soggy toasted plain breadtopped with a spoonful each of chopped tomatoes. Something similar to a genuine Bruschetta...similar as a frozen fish finger to a fresh trout. The Bruschetta was S$16.00.The small pizza arrived. It was fine. The highlight of the meal. The penne arrived. A small bowl, a tiny amount. Looked like a Weight-Watchers meal from the local supermarket freezer. S$9.00. Oldest daughter said it was yuk. (Her description). Then we saw our pizza arriving. Now, a pantalone pizza has a considerable 'WOW' factor as it wends its way through a restaurant. It's like an oversized inflated football-on-a-plate when it's correctly constructed. It turns heads. Ours was like a collapsed pastie. A mere shadow of what it was supposed to be. A dull semi-circular pie. An insult to Italy. To us, too. We blew S$27 bucks on that little nondescript pie. By the time we had finished, so had the wine. That was it. 100mls for S$13!!.Stay away from Prego. The food is lousy. It is overpriced. As is the wine. Prego appears to be a restuarant that is fading fast. It is long past its use-by date
3
The strong point of the restaurant is its very good pasta and pizza. Nice flavors and very good cooking "al dente". The menu is also very well set up and there is a good selection of wines. On the negative side I found the restaurant really expensive for the quality it provides. I really get pissed of when I saw that they charge 12 S$ for a medium bottle of still mineral water. This is too much. Second negative point is the service time. While the staff was very attentive the food took a lot of time to come out and we had to wait about 20 minutes from the time we finished our first course to get the main.So while the quality of food is a solid 4 I can't give an overall 4 because of the inconveniences in the service and the low value for money
3
After 20 years, it still managed to pride itself by providing one of the best service of all the F&B outlets in the hotel. I give it 5 stars for service and I don't think anyone would fault me for doing that.As for the food, I must say its standard has sort of gradually declined over the years. I remember when it first opened its doors (then located at the Raffles shopping centre), it served one of the best antipasto and soups in town. Now all that is history.But I would still return to this restaurant now and then because of its super duper service
3
Extensive menu. Delicious but very expensive (prices are comparable to French restuarants). Portions are just right. Attentive service from friendly and knowledgeable staff. Special occasions only.
4
Great for stollen
2
Standard has gone down over the years

Good food & ambience. Liked the staff who entertained by twirling the pizza in the air - not sure if he is still there

I LOVE their tiramisu and cheesecake!

A great dining experience. Both food and champagne were exceptionally good. The service was not very good though, but I could see that they were trying their best to communicate with us. Oh... And I love the complimentary photo they took for us on the polaroid. Overall, fantastic

Huge serving
3
Ok food but too loud to have a decent chat
4
good pizza n cheap
4
5 stars for the unparalleled 'uniquely-Singapore' coconut-infused cheesecake, that I first sampled at a conference upstairs and traced down to this deli. The overall rating is marred by its unexceptional food (which I'd only rate a 3*)
4
This is one of the places where the waiter comes up to you every two minutes and offers/asks you a bunch of stuff. I had the ribeye, asked for medium-rare, but was told that the meat was already prepared to well done. Strange, but I ate it anyways and of course, the meat was tough. Good wine, great salad and desserts. Would go back again
4
Good Italian. Menu does not change often. It is open until late 1 AM, you can always grab some pasta...
2
Pizzas and pastas very average. Poor service.

Nice italian for casual dining

Good new wine collection at the cellar. Quality food.

great selection of pasta! you're sure to pick a winner...
5
One of the best Italian food and what's best when you get to hear great live opera tunes sang by their very own singers. BRAVO !!
4
Authentic Italian. Started bread with Tomatoe dip is addictive. Try the Vongole if you are a shellfish fan
4
Versatile kids menu. Chef can customise according to preferences.
4
$$$ but I thought their ravioli was delicious!
2
Over priced pasta. I feel I can get better value for money elsewhere. Go only if you have a discount available...
3
Their Prego Pizza is crispy and thin, hardly get tired of it, they served great wine too, per pax around 20- 30 plus
3
This is a superB Italian Restaurant. I love the duck liver, taste as good as foie gra.

Great italian food and good atmosphere! Service is impeccable!

seriously, what's the hype? never quite understood it. disappointed every single time i had to eat there - mainly cos' other ppl paying for it. definitely not worth your hard earned money.
5
One of the best places for italian food centrally located
4
Good standard but can be exp sometimes esp during holidays. Lasagne is good
3
Standard had dropped a little for the price you need to pay. I still like the bread very much.. n the cappacio is just perfect.
