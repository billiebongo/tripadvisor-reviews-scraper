Good quality and quantity of food on offer, although I wasthere right on the closing time there was still lots of food on offer and hot. The staff were helpful in advising the closing time in advance and I was allowed to stay to finish my meal even though the buffet had closed.

Our last night of a short stay in Singapore our friends took us to this restaurant. It was a very pleasant experience. We had gone over for a short visit because a good friend had a difficult operation and my wife wanted to spoil her during her recuperation at home. Because of that we had not been out at all during our short stay, which is unusual for us when we are in Singapore because we just love the food in Singapore. So whether it was the relief of a our friend's health improving so well, or whether it was just really down to the restaurant, i do not know. We just had a really good evening and next time we are in Singapore we will visit again under normal circumstances, but for now we have memories of excellent food, good ambiance, good company and good service
