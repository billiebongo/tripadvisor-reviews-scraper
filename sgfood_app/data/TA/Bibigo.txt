We came here as a group of 5 and weren't disappointed. We all orders off of the set menu which is 3 courses for £13 then added an extra each so we could try a variety. The salads to start from the set menu for some reason we not uniform and some got more than others but was very nice all the same with a tasty dressing. I had the dumplings which were good and again with a sweet tasting sauce, I also got the deep fried cuttlefish which was slightly chewy but a good size portion, also tried the red chicken and tofu which were all delicious. We had a variety of mains but I went for a traditional bibimbap with beef and had to pay extra for fried egg, it came in a hot stone bowl and I enjoyed very much (although I have had slightly better from a food market I must admit). The lighting is low in this establishment and adds to the ambiance. It is also an open kitchen but was well ventilated. The service was swift although some staff seemed a little rude but maybe slight language barrier. All in all would recommend this place. With food and a couple cocktails each we paid around £175

We have been 2 weeks in our Asia tour in Malesia and Singapore. Somehow we been 4 time's in Korean restaurants in Langkawi and Singapore. Korean food is good and their chilisauces are really great. Bibigo in safe choice in Raffels City complex. Many variations of great dishes from Korean kitchen. Try it you'll love it

Bibigo offers different flavours of Bimbimbap (Korean Mixed Rice with Spicy Bean Sauce). All set inclusive appetiser (Korean kimchi), main course (Bimbimbap) and hot rice tea. They offers vegetarian too (exclude meat, more vegetables).Waiters and waitresses collect orders. Food served. Payment over the cashier counters after meals. This shop has loyalty programme, a frequent visit card will be issued to the diner.Enjoyed. Average about $17 per person

Everything else was only slight above average however. It was relatively cheap and will definitely come back again for the 2 dishes I mentioned in the title. They were very generous with the freebies (cans of apple vinegar drink and plenty of vouchers) but service have room for improvement. Overall a very enjoyable visit.

Really moist, and juicy. Must try!However, the beef was somehow dry and not as flavourful. The brown rice mixed with white rice was too soft. Disappointed that the black rice was no longer on the menu. Any chance of this being back on the menu?Brown rice tea really good! Could this be sold for us to take home? :

Came on a Tuesday evening, place was packed but just had to wait 5mins to get seated. Food was tasty and service was past and efficient. Only complaint I would have is that the food was not delivered at the same time, we were in 4 but 2 got their dishes first, 3rd person got his about 6-7 mind later and I another 6-7mins after him. All summed up would come again for reasonably priced Korean in a shopping mall

Had a girls dinner here last week quite at the last minute so we were really pleased to get a seat without waiting (it was just after 730pm on a weekday).We each ordered the bibimbap with beef and the hot pepper sauce. It was delicious and very generously portioned. The dinner set includes a bowl of seaweed soup and the usual array of delicious Korean side dishes. We also ordered the kimchee pancake to share. After seeing the size of our main course, we felt really greedy! Good spot for a casual dinner with friends.

Went here for dinner with family and friends. We're all quite small eaters so it was nice to be able to order a selection of dishes to share. Even nicer was the waitress who advised us on the dishes she would have and even advised more cost effective options, i.e., the same dishes on the set menu rather than a la carte. In these times when you often feel like you're being chased away when you have finished your meal so that someone else can be seated it was nice to be able to sit and chat and take our time

Had a hot pot bibimbap for lunch...the vegetarian kind and the folks there knew about making it vegetarian. it was yummy and the gochujang with it was flavourful! loved it!
4
Food is light and non-greasy. Just felt that the menu has a lack of selection for dishes to share. FYI - Restaurant tends to be really really crowded during peak hours.
4
One of my favorite weekday lunch places. Fast and good service, fairly priced food items and a good selection of healthy items.

This place is modern Korean food. Nice food, good beer, good service. Find the Suntec outlet better than Raffles City one. The outlet at Raffles City is too cramped.

(Visited : March 2014)I loved the food here so much, as it is healthy, delicious and not too salty or oily, and yet still manages to retain the authenticity of the dishes. I like how with some dishes, you can customise them, by selecting the type of rice and sauces that you prefer. I also agree with a previous poster who raved about the kimchi. It is the real deal indeed :D (Kimchi lovers take note ^^)Service here is generally friendly and helpful too. As this place can get very busy, it is best to come a little earlier or later. Now i wish Bibigo will open some branches in Australia

Had dinner here with 2 mates. They shared an appetizer Seafood pancake. I took a piece and it was really good. It taste light and not heavily laden with oil. There was enough seafood and vegetables in every bite. I had the Seafood soft tofu stew. It tasted really good. The flavour of the soup is not too salty and it taste perfectly fine. In conclusion, if you're looking for a place to eat healthy korean food. This would be place to go

I was at Raffles City and had a craving for Korean food. I headed down to the basement and spotted Bibigo. I had dined at Bibigo some months ago and had a good memory of the meal then. My lunch partners and I decided to come here for lunch. Here are the highlights of our meal:- Fried Dumplings With Vegetables in Spicy Sauce: $7. The dumplings are mini sized and you can pop one easily into your mouth. The vegetables are sliced red and white cabbage mixed in sweet and sour sauce. which was tangy, and it’s a good complement to the dumplings. Nice! - Grilled Pork Belly: $22. This was served on a hot plate with grilled onions, kimchi, sliced garlic, seasoned spring onion side dish and 3 types of sauce – ssamjang, salt and sesame oil & kohot. The pork belly is yummy. This is one of the few occasions where I do not remove the fat layer and just pop the whole pork slice into my mouth. The spring onion side dish is simply marinated and tastes good. Recommended! - Braised Mackerel In Spicy Sauce: $26. Mackerel braised in Bibigo spicy and sweet sauce with radish and leek. I am usually a fan of mackerel, but this made me a convert. The fish is fresh and tasty. Its cooked in Korean chilli paste. A tad spicy, but it goes well with the fish. The radish slices were good too. - Spicy Rice Cake with Ramen Noodles: $8. Bibigo rice cake simmered in Kohot sauce with ramen noodles, hard boiled egg and fish cake. This was especially good. I liked the rice cake and noodles in this dish, allowing me to have 2 different textures in 1 dish. The Korean fish cake was also nice. But you must eat it fast, cos the noodles will continue to cook due to the heat and turn ‘soggy’ and not have the ‘Q-Q’ texture. Recommended! - Spicy Tomato Ramen: $13. Spicy tomato ramen soup with vegetables. The soup has a nice tomato flavour which I found unique. It was a little spicy for me, but overall, it was alright. - Riso Nero Ice Cream: $4.50. Bibigo special black glutinous rice ice cream with crunched up Korean crispy rice cracker. Loved the ice cream, which reminded me of our local pulut hitam dessert. The rice crackers were home-made and a little too hard for me to bite. - Hoddeok A La Mode: $6. Sweet Korean pancake with cinnamon and sugar in between, and topped with black glutinous rice ice cream, oats, walnuts and drizzled with syrup. I loved everything about this. The pancake was good and I loved the oats sprinkled on the top. We finished this in a jiffy. Eat it quickly, as the pancake is hot and the ice cream will melt! Highly recommended! - Glazed Sweet Potato: $6. Strips of fried sweet potato topped with Korean crispy rice cracker and walnut coated with Korean grain syrup. Its nice. Portion is a little big. Good to share amongst 6 pax. Overall, a satisfying meal and we left happy. Will be back again. Recommended

I heard some good reviews about this place and decided to bring dad out for dinner whilst the bf is away. As a vain, healthy but discerning eater It's natural that the first thing that caught my attention was their slogan: "Healthy & Fresh Korean Food". I was like Hell yeah! I want this now! Upon arrival, we were promptly led to our seats.Whilst flipping through the menu, which by the way is available online via their website, I was delighted to see healthy wholesome dishes with heaps of veggies. Love it! So after much deliberation, dad decided to go with "Hot stone Bulgogi with brown and white rice set". I took the "Hot stone bimbimbap, with beef and the brown & white rice combo". As I am not a big fan of spice, I took the non spicy option: sesame and soy. Just to explain how the hot stone bimbimbap option goes... First you choose what meat you want, then what sort of rice, then comes the sauce. It's easy and well explained on the menu, so not to worry. Dad and I also ordered the seafood pancake to share. Honestly the portions are huge.1. Seafood pancake- It's served on a hot plate over the flame- crispy goodness with a generous amount of shrimp, squid and chives (I think), served with citrus soy dipping sauce- this has gotta be one of the better ones I have tried in Sg2. Hot stone Bulgogi- honestly speaking, this tasted normal and was clearly forgettable. Dad felt that it was too sweet and "nothing fantastic" I quote.3. Hot stone bimbimbap with beef- Now This has gotta be one of the best tasting bimbimbap I have had in a long while!! There's something about the crispy bits of rice at the bottom... So fragrant! Everything just works darn well together. The minced beef, vege and sauce- note of caution: do not simply pour the entire sauce/s into your rice. Put in a little at a time then taste...- I only wished they had more ingredients in the bowl. They were generous with the rice!!- Because this was a set, it came with 3 sides with a bowl of bean sprout soup. OMG!! The kimchi sides were amazing! I have never tasted a commercialized Korean chain restaurant serving up authentic Korean kimchi in SG. Usually I tend to complain how disappointing the kimchi sides are at other Korean rest. But when I ate this, I was like, "man this is the bomb!" Definitely completed my dinner experience for the evening!!I dare say I am relatively impressed with the food quality here. I will be back for more!! Another word of caution, you might tend to smell like food with all the hot plate dishes around you. Also if you are on a date, pls bring a pack of strong mints with you. Trust me, you will get garlic breath if and when you decide to eat anything hot plate.For now, Fitness First members and DBS card members get enjoy 10% off your meal. So, hurry on down now!Ps.

We had the Hotstone Bibimbap with Black Rice, Spicy Pork and Sesame sauce ($16) as well as the Bibimbap ($15) in the same combination but with Citron Soysauce. With a just a dollar difference, the Hotstone version would definitely be a better option if you like your food warm. As a highly versatile dish that can be paired with a variety of colorful toppings, I like this customized concept as it simplifies this Korean rice dish but preserves the texture and flavours. At least, we no longer have to stick to THAT sweet red sauce. Ginseng Orange Salad was not available so we switched to Pan Fried Tofu and Stir Fry Kimchee Pork ($14) which were larger than shown on menu. The plain tofu complemented the salty stir fry but I thought why don't they just cut the tofu and stir-fry everything together? The seasonal edition Gangnam Style Fried Chicken ($12) came with three different sauces -salt/sweet/spicy. The golden fried chicken that contained surprising bits of chilli and vegetables, were tender with crisp exterior. Since it was already very salted, the salt dip doesn't serve any purpose. The Sweet Potato Mattang ($6) were similar to the Japanese Daigaku-Imo, not crunchy but soft and mushy. Topped with crispy rice crackers and walnuts, they were coated in just the right amount of honey but not exactly piping hot.  Food is overall quite good but the poor service were too glaring to go undetected. It's never a rule of courtesy to remove diner's plate without asking if they have finished with the food.

Patronized bibigo at Raffles City Shopping Centre recently. It was my first time and I enjoyed my lunch there. Even though place was a little small , it's still good with little customer when I went. Hence service was rather quick and the food was served promptly. Service staff was also helpful to recommend when I asked about vegetarian options. Price was reasonably well also with card promotions ongoing. I will definitely patronize again soon. For in dept reviews and pictures , do visit http://ext-wanderlust.blogspot.sg/

I've visited some other Bibigo branches in Indonesia and even in Seoul. And I can say with no doubt that Bibigo Singapore (Raffles City branch) is beyond my expectation. I went there with a friend for a dinner and ordered pork/squid bulgogi, pajeon seafood pancake, barley tea, and tofu set (can't remember that exact set). We love everything that we ordered, especially the pork/squid bulgogi. The sauce was amazing!The waiter that served us was helpful and really friendly. We stayed until they announce that they're about to close simply because we didn't even realize that times passed by. The ambiance was good. Even though the place was quite packed with after-work crowds, we still could talk comfortably without worrying that the person sitting on the next table could hear the entire thing. We'll definitely keep coming back whenever we're craving for yummy Korean foods!

I had traditional Bulgogi and mrs had Squid and pirk Bulgogi. I waited more spicy hit, but I should ask when I ordered that I want real Korean hot. Mrs was very pleased with her portion. Even Korean beer first time was ok. Service could be a bit faster but overall expression is ok

This is the second time I have been to Bibigo at Raffles City. I was impressed with both visits.Food is very impressive - I tried the hotplate beef bulgogi which was truly amazing. The pancake, tteokbokki (rice cakes), ginseng salad, and japchae were very good too. I just couldn't get enough of these dishes.Service was very prompt and the staff were very attentive and efficient. The ambience was average as it was at the basement of the mall, and it tends to be slightly noisy due to the high crowd volume

Bibigo is a chain restaurant and with PSY touting some of the stand-up banners in front of the shop, what can you expect?I was craving badly for Korean food and didn't want to travel far for my usual favourites. Hence, I made do with the Bibigo outlet at Nex. Due to my intense cravings, I went back to Bibigo for dinner twice in a row.Their tagline claims that they serve healthy and fresh Korean dishes to the point that some are bland - namely the Ginseng Chicken Stew - no taste of ginseng at all in the soup although I couldn't find fault with the tenderness of the chicken or the smooth sticky rice within the chicken. However, the chicken could do with a bit more flavouring rather than relying on the salted powder provided.Verdict:Goldongmyeon: Salad Noodle - One of the best dishes on the menu. If you're craving for noodles yet want a dose of veggies, order this! The dish includes a sprinkle of grilled chicken but the overall flavour of the noodles (tossed in delicious, flavourful sauce which I do not know the name of) more than makes up for it.Brown Noodle Soup - Beware! Looks can be deceiving. The picture on the menu portrays the dish as oh-so-innocent looking making one think that it is just a normal soybean soup topped with crispy rice and noodles. Although the description did add the word 'spicy' in the right up, the menu should indicate a chili spicy icon too! The soup is delicious nonetheless but the after taste of spiciness is overwhelming.Mandoo (dumplings) and Rice Cake Soup - The soup is delicious! The rice cake is small in shape and the dish had an adequate portion; not too much so you won't feel so full, with about 4-5 big dumplings. Interestingly, the set includes rice and I wonder how one can consume so much carbohydrates in one sitting? I didn't finish the rice though, too full!Kimchi platter - I'd very much prefer the cabbage kimchi. The radish and bamboo shoot kimchi is fine but well, it all boils down to individual preference.Boiled pork slices - We ordered this as we felt our main dishes lack meat but at the price of S$16 and 6 slices of pork, we felt that this is way overpriced. Nothing fantastic to shout about. Not recommended!Tip: If you're craving for authentic Korean cuisine a la Chigae (stews etc), you'd be better off going to other Korean Restaurants like Big Mama or Kim's Korean Family Restaurant or my favourite Your Woul at Novena etc

We stayed at the Fairmont Hotel and decided to try this as it was in the basement of Raffles City. Portions are smallish and, therefore, the prices are a little on the high side. For example, a hotplate of beef bulgogi costs $22 before tax, while an extra rice is $2. The mankoo (?) - pork and veg dumplings - were very good, though still a little expensive at $9. We also ordered a spicy pork hotstone set. There was not much pork in the dish, but the spicy bean sauce was delicious

I love bibimbap and this is my go to place for that because I can skip the thick red sauce, and opt for citron soy. Choice of meat, sauce, stone bowl and rice and generally healthy options with black rice, white rice and mix. It's popular enough to be a "go early or go late" lunch place. Decent service completes the reasons why it is one of my favorites

I'm not a fan of Korean food but I have to applaud Bibigo for changing my mind (ok not that I'm a Korean food fan now but I'm more willing to try). The one I went was at Raffles City. Ordered Seafood pancake, some BBQ beef & other stuff including a ginseng chicken soup. I thought most of what we were were really good.And they have 4 types of rice to choose from - black, barley, brown and normal white. Since there were for of us...we ordered all 4 just to try a little but of each. I like barley most. Basically it feels like you're eating rice but a little chewy (just like eating cooked barley).The service can be a little slow at times especially it's a weekend and people are queing like crazy!Overall, I like this place - both food and environment. Very suitable for a sumptous meal! :-

Food tasted good. I ordered the spare ribs which took a long time to deliver. You need to be sure what you are getting here and order what you need, nothing is included. You're in the middle of a food hall so no ambiance. This is one step up from ordering at the counter. Good value for money.

Bibigo is one of my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Definitely my favourite Korean restaurant, which I frequent often, both at the Raffles Shopping Mall (City Hall MRT) outlet and NEX Shopping Mall outlet (Serangoon MRT). My favourite dishes are (highly recommended) - char grilled Bulgogi, chicken kimchi fried rice, squid/pork Bulgogi, red chicken, pajeon seafood pancake and japchae silvernoodle. I think I ordered the same few dishes everytime I dine here. I brought many of my friends from overseas here and they all love it!Highly recommended :)If you think my review is useful, please click on the "helpful vote". Thank you :

Mid-level chain of Korean restaurants serving not only several versions of bibimbap, but basically most Korean popular dishes: pancakes, bulgogi, galbi, spicy soup, steamed chicken soup; not top quality but pretty tasty and at a reasonable price. It's like a Korean version of the Crystal Jade Kitchen concept, albeit less 'efficient'. However, it is much more global - with outposts in Beijing, LA, London - for it is owned by the CJ conglomerate group, which shares the same family roots as Samsung
