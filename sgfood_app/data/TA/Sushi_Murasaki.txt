Hands down best gyu-don in town.
The chef is very skilled and ambience is very sophisticated.
I have only had lunch sets here but everything I tasted was beyond expectation.
Highly recommended!

The restaurant is owned by Mr Raymond and is split into the Sushi Counter Section and Robatayaki Section. I have tried both sections on separate occasions. Overall Pricing for Robatayaki is reasonable. Recommended dishes include the Wagyu Beef Steak, Chicken Tsukune Stick and Hamachi Kama. There are 3 Omakase selections for the Sushi Section. The highly recommended one is the $188 per head, because although the number of Sushi is reduced, they include their A4 Wagyu Don which also has Uni, Foe Gras.The popular Sake Dasai 39 and Dasai 23 are also available at $218 and $288 respectively.This place is good for corporate lunches and dinners.

We decided to try Murazaki from recommendation.We asked for him he set dinner for myself and my vegetarian daughter.The outcome and the experience was amazing. Especially the snow crab tempura was truly amazing. Very highly recommended if you are looking for high quality Japanese dining.

Met a business contact for lunch at Sushi Murasaki. I had previously entertained there business associates there before and went away impressed. Fro lunch, it's probably easy to go with the set menu which has a decent selection to chose from. My business contact ordered the Bapa Chirashi whereas I took the Kaisen Don. The lunch set came with a starters, including a Chawanmushi and pickles. The starters were all very decent and the Chawanmushi was delicious. The egg was silky and rich which made you really want to savour it slowly. The entree itself was impressive with the sashimi of excellent quality and the presentation was impressive. Desert was a scoop of green tea ice cream which was pretty average in my opinion. The wait staff were attentive but were not the most articulate. But overall, a good dining experience and will definitely return

I've now been a few times with my family to this restaurant and I must say that the freshness and quality of the food is impeccable. Some of the produce is actually sourced by the chef by him physically flying to Japan and bringing it back.The overall service is spot on, however it is pretty pricey. I think we averaged about S$150-200 per person each. Value for money...? - I'm not sure it is, but excellence and quality of food cannot be doubted. If it's within your budget, give it a go and you won't be disappointed.

Between a row of Japanese restaurants at Millenia Walk, Sushi Murasaki is a must visit place. Singaporean Chefs Raymond & Max are making this a top restaurant. Fresh, creative & generous Omakase Kumo set is full of delicious courses to enjoy high quality food. Good value for Omakase lovers & we're going back again soon

The head chef was very down to earth. Explains and teaches you to eat every course. He said if you wish to eat anything from Japan, just let me know I will import it for you. The sushi were very fresh cause they just arrive earlier from Japan. Top notch ! Can't wait to go back for more.

Took a work colleague from Europe to lunch who explicitly requested to have "fine Sushi", and we were not disappointed from our first time experience at Sushi Murasaki. Having been ushered in by the very friendly hostess we were seated in the "back room" which showcased a very modern and sleek, but distinctly Japanese ambiance. It was cozy yet still oozed lot's of cosmopolitan vibes - just how you can only experience it in a true Japanese setting. We chose the lunch menu and my colleague added some sashimi specials, and we received our food soon after - presented by a very friendly and professional Japanese chef. What can I say: everything tasted fantastic and was super fresh and delightful. We truly enjoyed every bite, and I can only recommend Sushi Murasaki after this excellent experience. The lunch did come at a price, but this first class Sushi experience deserved every dollar spent. Will definitively be back
