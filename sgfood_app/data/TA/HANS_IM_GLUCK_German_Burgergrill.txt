Good selection of veggie burgers, a rarity in Singapore. I also appreciated the option of ordering a burger without bread!
5
Delicious vegetarian burgers - so many options. The sweet potato fries were tasty too! Make sure you try a cocktail.

It was a treat after our dental appointment. And we enjoyed ourselves so much. Loved the ambience. The servers were warm and friendly and the burgers were good. Also good place to eat with our vegan friends

The interior design of the place is like no other, making you feel super cosy and comfortable! The burgers tho were not as glorious as I hoped them to be. Would prefer the meat to be less dry and the burger stacked higher!!

We stayed nearby and ate a couple of times here. Burger offer was wide and both times we enjoyed our meals. Service was quick and staff gave good advice. Music was a little loud but the decor and wood (which looks like birch) was quite different from most other places in Singapore.

Great staff really relaxed and nothing is a bother. Burgers were amazing and cocktails great. We enjoyed a Singapore Sling there, as Raffles was closed, and these guys did not disappoint. So back we went for burgers, cocktails and heaps of sweet potato fries,yum. Its a must if you are visiting Singapore

This was my second visit to Hans im GlÃ¼ck and I have to say, their food tastes great and their set meals are really value for money. Definitely satisfied my appetite for a decent burger without breaking the bank. A big plus is also the atmosphere, which is modern and casual at the same time, making it the go-to place for me after work.

Very attractive looking restaurant in central position. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Food was excellent....masses of fries side dish and I never usually eat the bun but the bun served to me was delicious. Could not eat my meal fast enough! Short stop over in Singapore and very happy to dine in this restaurant
4
There are quite a varieties to choose from Vegetarian and Beef. My friend and I had each a beef burger (we each choose a different type) and were happy with the food. We added on calamari and it was delicious as well. Will go back and try other variety of food again.We sat indoor and I found the aircon abit too cold-ish. Will book the outdoor seats next round!
5
Had a family dinner there and loved the variety of burgers that catered to different diets, they even had allergen information. Staff was helpful and friendly. Place had a charming whimsical vibe.
5
Second time here and love that they have vegan options! Burgers are tasty, salads are great and generous in portions. Had a few cocktails here too which were also amazing and value for money. Now favourite joint for a good hang with friends!
5
We celebrated an early Valentine’s day dinner. Everyone was so friendly , they assisted us with the menu. The owner even check if our food is ok. The food was very good. I would recommend this to all my friends
5
The burgers served here (I tried Birkenwald and Klassik) did not disappoint at all!
The sides were pretty good as well, especially the steak fries (Fritten) and the Krautknolle (German white cabbage salad).
Try Outdoor setting, if you cannot stand rowdy indoors.
5
Excellent original menu.Professional service especially from our server/ waiter, Irving.
#402 table.... our choice.
The "back to back" Bar seating can't be popular nor comfortable........
We'll be back. AMG.

Was there to celebrate daughter's 21st b'day..staff was very friendly and prompt. Gave b'day girl free cocktail. Price was reasonable.. would be perfect if the sitting wasn't so cramped. The next table was just an arms length away wasn't feeling comfortable...
5
Was there with my friends for the first time and we love the various burgers that we ordered! Ample choices of vegan, beef and chicken burgers. They were delicious! Portion was just right as well. Ambience was cozy would definitely return!

My wife and I had the set lunch offer which came with a side dish and a thirst quencher.The drink was delicious and it was nice to receive such a large glass. The sweet potato fries were also very tasty.The interior is charming and we even really liked the plates and bowls!I had the burger with feta, bacon and plum jam. The overall flavour sensation was very nice and interesting.Unfortunately, this is supposed to be primarily a burger restaurant. The patty was thin,dry and almost tasteless. I'd just about say that even if the patty wasn't there, the overall flavour of the dish would be 90% the same! It wasn't much better than a frozen burger.When you decide to go to a burger restaurant you want to be able to taste the meat and the juice from that meat. e.g. Somewhere like Wildfire Burgers.Although Hans Im Gluck has MANY positives, with a burger patty so average, we'd see no reason to go back until that changes.Luckily, you'd think it should be an easy problem to fix

This was my third visit here and every time the food is amazing! The sweet potato fries are a must try. I am vegan, and finding a good burger place (carnivore approved) that has 4 vegan burgers is impressive. No joke, the wheat patties taste like meat, a little scary but so tasty! All the house made sauces are also a favourite
3
That place has a nice ambiance and is beautifully decorated.Table in the front are great but one time we were seated at the bar which is not very comfortable.Salad choices are nice. We especially like the Bravur.Burgers are overrated and pricewise on the high end. The second time we got our burgers almost cold and waited a long time.Great that they serve Paulaner beer - big plus
5
Burgers were nice and attentive service. Located at a cozy nook right near Orchard MRT. Will definitely go back again
4
Non typical German food. We had the chicken and vegetarian burgers. The vegetarian burgers are very flavorful while the chicken burger is quite tender. The food went well with the wheat beer!
4
You can't miss this distinctive decor when walking on Orchard Rd. The menu is equally tempting so I stopped for one of their Classik's and enjoyed a well prepared simple burger. Nice one.
4
Great experience in that burger restaurant, nice seating, nice atmosphere with choice of eating outside or inside. Nice cool german beer. Food for very good for value. Will be back.
3
The atmosphere and beers were great, and location couldn't be more central to Orchard. But the burgers are pre cooked with no option to choose temperature, and tasted quite bland. Would stop in for a drink but not to dine.
5
It was our first visit and the whole family enjoyed the well-thought-out forest decor and menu. We have already recommended it to friends who are travelling to Singapore.
5
A really cool and contemporary burger joint, with a great selection of both burgers and drinks. Service was quick and friendly
3
I loved the decor and they have an amazing burger menu. We tried one burger and what so special is the type of bun they are using. Much healthier and tastier what you get normally. Just burger patty was so thin ... you can only get them well done as they are too thin to cook them any other way. For 16.- bugs I think the burgers aren’t worth the money. Really sad as the idea is pretty cool

I have found burgers to be most tasty and satisfying at its simplest. I think it’s a simple food and sometimes the “gourmet” places unnecessarily complicates it with “high end” ingredients like truffles and mushrooms and whatnots.Thankfully, this new German burger bar avoids these pitfalls and keeps things simple, yet uniquely customisable. The decor is very nature-like, a disconnect from the busy heart of Orchard - it’s also very quite(at least in the interior, it has outdoor seating as well).The best thing about the burger is the sour dough bun(!), loved it- along with rest of the patty, bacon and cheese. They have some other options on the bun (as well as a non-bun version), but for me the bacon cheeseburger meal (comes with choice of sweet potato fries) and a side of coke was the best item to have.From now on, when in Orchard, if I have a burger craving this is the place I walk into.Revisit likelihood - Always

This is one of the best decorated places in Orchard road. very nice designed with woody nature as the main theme. I never heard of German burgers, so I decided to give it a try. The prices of burgers are roughly $16-21 with a side of fries and thought it must be very good since its so pricey.Unfortunately not so. The bun was cold, and the burger patty was dry, a bit thin. It was sa that TCC next door, a coffee place had a way better burger
4
This restaurant serves a wide selection of beef, chicken and vegetarian burgers. I have been there twice and the burgers were good at both times. The lunch set was of very good value.
4
Accomodating for a fussy 6 year old. Beer great (for us parents) and sweet potato fries a nice side.
3
I love the sweet potato fries here! This place has an excellent variety of vegetarian burgers. Their burgers are healthy but just a bit on the salty side for my liking...
4
It’s great see there’s choice for sweet potato fries! The burger is great and the lunch set is quite good for providing you hot and cold drinks! And the environment is unique to be sitting and chatting with friends
5
Love the setting of the restaurant. A great variety of burgers to choose from. Love that it offer vast option of vegetarian burger. Extensive beverage menu. Service is very friendly. Food came fast. A definite must try.

We recently visited Hans im Glueck, which is a German Burgergrill Place near Yotel on Orchard Road. Choice of Bun for your Burger or you get Naked Burger w/o Bun. Meat is good quality from Australia.Salads and Sides also a good variety to pick from with favourite Choice of Beverage alcoholic or non-alcoholic. Restaurant have a unique set up and interior design. Nice place to hang out with friends before and after shopping or clubbing

Impressive! A friend and I visited on recommendation from reviews and were delighted by the friendly service and good food. It's rare to be able to find burgers, sides and drinks for under $25 a pop but Hans has done it! I paid $25 for a large burger (which left me struggling to finish it), sweet potato fries (must try!), a coffee and a "thirst quencher" (cold drink). Typically sets come with a main and side and one drink at most, so Hans' offering sets them apart. The atmosphere was lovely, chill and laid-back and the music served to enliven the atmosphere. I must commend the wait staff for their excellent service and attentiveness, especially when one came by mid-meal to check on us. The location is accessible and not too noisy given it is situated right smack on Orchard Road. I highly recommend Hans!!

Most restaurants take the last order by 915 ... but hans im gluck closes at 12 midnight. Tucked at a quieter corner ( start of orchard road) , i love the decor . Which is similar to the outlet i went to in berlin. Music in the background was soft underground music... cool vibes. I was introduced to the “ after 5 “ menu. Which is burger+sgd15( choose one side and cocktail) ... quite a good deal as one cocktail is about sgd14. I went for the bacon cheese hurger with sourdough bread , basil gin cocktail and asian salad. This was indeed a healthier burger option than the usual fast food style burgers. Will return again
4
Great ambience with choice of air con or al fresco sections and right along Orchard Road but surrounded by greenery and tree trunks as walls. Wide selection of burgers with sourdough, multigrain or no bun (naked). The sets are really worth it - Ad $5 to the Burger price and you get a thirst quencher (super selection - Cucumber basil lemonade was great! - a side and a hot drink. Good selection of vegetarian and vegan burgers too. The seating is a little cramped but service was attentive and friendly.

Spent our New Year's eve with family for the first time at this restaurant. Fresh breathe of air with such a restaurant along Orchard Road. Nice for a change with burgers and nice simple deco. Burgers are not something I go for often at all so not sure I would go to this restaurant that often. Guess I can try their salad next time
