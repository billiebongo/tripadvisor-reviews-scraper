My wife and I have been eating here for the longest time. This is one of the best pratas you can find in Singapore!
5
My favorite place for prata and I must say the standard is still there.
If you happen to be neat there, please go!
4
Damn tok kong prata! The prata is cooked only after Mr Moghan receives the orders. Hence, they are crispy and warm. Super shiok!
The best in singapore, JB and some say Batam!

We found this place when we went to buy noodle next to it. The taste of the curry is not really delicious but the roti prata is good enough.

I've been going to this restaurant regularly for the past five years and it is really, for me, one of the best prata places in Singapore. True, the menu doesn't change. They aren't looking to compete with some of the prata chains. But you will instead consistently get a great prata here. Nb Sunday queues especially after 9am can be long. And they close everyday when the run out of food, which translates to around lunchtime
4
The prata here is really tasty and the price is very good. HOWEVER they are priced individually and to be honest one alone will not fill you up at all. Get 3! There is quite a long wait as they are cooked individually and in turn and by the time my order was done I didn't want to wait around to out another one in.Really good quality, definitely with a visit!

Small little stall in a small little corner “coffee shop” in a street little know of, the Moghans cooks up Prata (pan fried dough) in different versions! From plain version to egg and onions to the mammoth mutabak (chicken/lamb or beef filling with mosels of onions and eggs) it is always crispy and soft served with a punchy curry! A wonderful meal for breakfast (closes normally by noon) so be early and join the crowd waiting as each prata are cook on the spot upon ordering!

Please do not give them a #bibgourmand business is good enough at my fav prata stall. Had to 打包 my roti prata today as there was no tables and no parking ... very normal for Sundays here. Kopitiam was buzzing. Prata with egg and onion was good for takeaway, if to dine-in I love their plaster (a prata with a sunny-side up egg stuck to it like a plaster ) the mutton 'tulang' curry is superb and the sambal gives it an additional kick. Will try their coin pratas on my next visit
2
Made a special trip there today. Got there by 10 am and found the corner location with the right address. No prata in sight. Was told that they had sold out. A Chinese/Malay restaurant was there but no sight of Mr & Mrs. No queue either. The two stars was therefore for the disappointment of not being able achieve our breakfast prata craving than any reflection on the current restaurant which we didn't stay for. Found our way to Dunman Food Centre nearby for their duck rice!

My husband had spotted this aged coffeeshop during our usual neighbourhood drive around. It always seemed to have quite a few people waiting around the shop in front; and it's a Prata shop. We took the opportunity when we saw some empty seats and I'm glad we did. The prata was crispy but not dry and the highlight was the sambal sauce! It really lifted the taste when combined with the curry sauce. The only thing to note will be to order more than the standard serving of 2 pieces. Very happy that we managed to finally try this little gem and no doubt we will be back ( just not sure if there'll be table available when we want it)
4
When we go breakfast, there is always Long queue to get food. The Prata is nice, and service is good.
5
The prata is fluffy and cooked on the spot. Hidden gem but open secret to people live east.
There's mutton and fish curry to choose from plus the anchovies sambal Chilli is really good
5
Delicious prata and curry sauce, big steamed bun and super sweet iced coffee. Breakky of champions!
The place to be in Joo Chiat for breakfast.
4
The prata is very crispy and tasty. The curry was delicious.
The best prata in Singapore, JB, and some say, Batam!
In local terms, I will describe the prata here as "damn tok kong lah"!
Super shiok lah!
5
Simply the best prata there is in Singapore. Their plain prata was thin, crispy and delicious. Their sauce selection is excellent and goes perfectly together with the roti
4
What sets Moghans' prata apart from the rest is its lightness and crispiness. I had a total of four and felt like I could have another four. Hence my nick name for their prata "Air Prata".
5
This place sells the best prata in Singapore with their awesome curry. I have not come across any other place in Singapore with such delicious curry.The wait is long about 20 minutes on normal days which may stretch to 30 minutes on busy days. But it is worth the wait
4
We went there this morning after reading TA reviews and the food was great, as described by others. Ordering was an issue for us Westerners (probably the place isn't used to foreigners) but a wonderfully generous local couple came to our rescue - it's obviously popular with many locals. We had plan and egg prata, both delicious when dipped in the chilli gravy. Thanks to Jimmy & Beo for your generosity
5
It's just a little stand in front of a Chinese Restaurant but man, do they do a business. Sitting on the street sipping our morning coffee and nibbling our prata, I felt like I was experiencing Singapore as it was 100 years ago! Great atmosphere and food. What an experience

~GPS will bring you there but parking gotta get creative with this corner at 8am being relatively crowded ~already well known in the area and a favorite for roti prata shops in Singapore, I stood watching Mr Mohgan work his magic and truly the crispy comes out ...~being my first time 2016May I was curious how folks placed their orders as there were those who queued and those who walked right up to speak to and presumed placed their orders with Mrs Mohgan directly~unsure I joined the long quiet queue while Mrs Mohgan recorded almost every order place meticulously into a note book... while summarily forgetting a few (bound to happen considering the volume and mix of ppl ordering)~the packing of takeaway bags of fish/chicken curry were so quickly taken up that there's really no way to ensure the right quantity was prepared for every order so the packing kept piling up while service kept it permanently at a shortage! yes you gotta see it yourself~while I could not understand how orders were given (curiously I would bet) there were people in my queue who prolly didn't know either or were like me a first timer :) because the Singapore silence of waiting for our turn was real strange since Mrs Mohgan ignored the queue till she was ready and everything she was ready it was in between taking and filling orders so it's impossible to know when is the right time to order~yet there were people, prolly regulars whom she knew who could walk right up and be served or maybe they were already ahead of us (anyway not a single one made any complaints)~when I got to the front of the queue it was about 5 mins before she turned to me to ask and I asked about the combinations and costs. She answered while still packing away and I made a large order of 20 packs with various additions... she is a super polite lady never missing a beat!~5mins after my order I observed a seemingly bystander kinda guy walk up beside Mr Mohgan and after a few acknowledgements rolled up his sleeves and go right at pulling the prata... dude that's way cool and strange and if eating prata ignoring any hygiene standards but that's how we roll :)~a mere 35mins later I was off to enjoy really crispy roti prata that was delicious with every condiment I'd ordered and it was accurately delivered!this is a GEM of a find, prices are reasonable and food is fantastic
4
prata was very good, though the wait would probably take you an hour at least, even during "non-peak" periods - went at 10am on a weekday after landing back in Singapore. while waiting, you could also order the wanton mee there which is pretty legit as wel
5
Drag yourself away from the glitz and glamour of Singapore and visit the non assuming gem.We went there to munch on pratas for breakfast and they were sensational. Plain, egg, cheese - we ate the lot with a lovely lentil based side.Street food at its best, just stay away from the coffee!
4
The Prata is very good, but it's not consistent. When its thick and crispy it's tip top, but in the last few months there have been some changes. Still a quality product.Great coffee, funny guy who runs the bit with his brother.The noodles and dumplings are fantastic. My wife and I go for the dumpling soup every few mornings, and our 16 month old daughter loves it, too.
5
My local friends took me to this unassuming place. Don't rely on signage because it's hard to find the actual name on the outside of the restaurant. Everything is flavorful and tasty (also messy)! A fun and inexpensive place! It gets crowded so go early! You will have to self-wait your table for the most part
5
I think you'd better catch a taxi because it's local resident area. Taxi cost will take about 8-10$. It saves your time and your energy also. The price of roti prata is affordable, you can call it with the mushroom, egg or plain filling. The curry sauce is up to your choose from ordinary or lamb curry. The flavour of curry to me is a little bit sour and different from other. But the prata is very crispy and softly inside. You can have fun to watch how they make the prata and you must take line to order and then get the table wait for the dish come out. You can call the drinks in the inside of the restaurant, I ordered 2 version of terik tea: with ice and hot, with ice you must pay extra $0.5. The total cost for this breakfast is 18-20$, the meal took 8-10$, we ordered 1 mushroom and 1 egg with original curry, and 1 hot and 1 ice terik tea. It's not a heavy dish eventhough the prata itself is fried. Highly recommend this place for trying because it's worthy. ;

I came at about 8.15, ordered 1 plain prata and 1 egg prata for myself and *many* plain pratas for my husband and his grandparents. Waited for about 30 minutes, which is fine and expected. There was also a coffee stall in the area to buy something light while waiting.We're amazed at how the "aunty" can always remember who ordered what and just never get it wrong! All in all, awesome place if you've got some time to spare for breakfast

Roti Prata is an inexpensive Indian dish which can only be found in Singapore and Malaysia (where it is known as roti canai). It is one of the must-try dishes if you are a visitor to Singapore.It's fried over a flat hot plate of oil. Basically an unhealthy version of naan. But I like it and can have it for breakfast every Sunday. Eat it with a cup of kopi (local coffee).This place used to be my favorite until it was displaced by Rahmath Muslim Food prata in Defu Lane. But Rahmath moved to Hougang and now Telok Kurau where the prata is no longer as good. After trying Moghans again today, we conclude that Moghans is back to Number One, at least for us. There are very limited parking lots along Crane Road and surrounding roads. There is a big URA carpark at the junction of Joo Chiat Place / Tembeling Road nearby.This place can get crowded and hot. Go early, before 8 am.

Found this roti prata stall by chance when driving around the neighborhood and saw crowded queue. Self service by first queue to order, look for your table and sit down to wait for the food to be ready. The roti prata is thick and crispy and served with dhal and fish curry, complementary sambal chilly is also available and make the eating experience nicer. In the same coffee shop, there is a Malay stall selling nasi lemak, Mee siam, gado-gado, also a Chinese stall serving wonton noodle with good crowd.

We missed good roti prata in Singapore. Most of the good ones are quite far away from City. From the web we found this highly rated small one in a corner kopitam in Joo Chiat area. Excellent roti and curry. Great thing to have as breakfast

I recommend get there by taxi because it's far from any bus stop and taxi is a good choice if you want to save time to look up the map - sometimes the map is useless I supposed. First thing when you come there is get in the line to wait for order , after that you can find your seat in or outside. The food takes time so don't be angry if you have to wait too long. In the time of waiting you can order a drink inside the house, I recommend the terik tea with or without ice is ok The filling in Roti Prata you can choose between egg, mushroom or something else I didn't remember ( sorry my mind is like gold fish :( ) the sauce eats with is curry - of course - you can choose with the lamb or not but the price is just more 1 or 2 dollars so I think it's ok. The flavor of the roti prata is a little bit plain but it's perfect when you eat with curry sauce and even better when you drink with terik tea there. I and my boyfriend ordered the same curry without meat and I ordered the mushroom cake and he is egg and both is delicious. The texture of the cake I think is really good, crispy outside but moist inside because of the filling. The flavor of curry is salty and sour - I think as it's Indian's curry flavor is supposed to be like that. The price is absolutely affordable, terik tea is 1$ hot and extra 50c with ice. 2 Roti Prata like above is about 5$. I think it's the cheapest breakfast in Singapore that I can find. Without the fee of taxi to get there. But it's really good and I do recommend you to go there once when you come to Sing. Love it and the neighbors there is so friendly to help us with order. Thanks again and I hope it's helpful for you❤

Nice pratas, especially their plaster which is a special egg prata, definitely unlike the usual egg prata u eat elsewhere. Curry is not as good as other prata shops but definitely worth trying.

First time here! We enjoyed a selection of four pratas: egg, cheese, onion and mushroom.Taste - very good (and crispy as advertised) ... lite and not oilyQuality - actually much better we think than the prata on KillineyPresentation - are you kidding? If you're local, it's really the taste and quality that count. But presentation is authentic and on a stainless steel plate with three condiments/curries tooService - the Mrs. is very polite (the Mr. and associate rotated in their prata prep and cooking)Ambience - open air on the corner with inside (within the building and sidewalk) and outside (on the sidewalk) seatingCost: Couldn't go wrong for ~ S$6 for two with the healthy-size prata servings. We also had two hot coffees too at S$1 each from a next door vendor. Think cost and value are the key factors after taste and quality. Definitely a repeat-go-back-to-dining destination. And, yes, there can be folks waiting for their orders (even at 8 in the morning) but I observed the Mrs. does maintain a good awareness on each of the individuals/families whose order is whose as she writes them down on her hanging clip board. Popular with locals from all backgrounds. A definite recommendation. And compliments to the Mr. and Mrs. and the support folks too. We can appreciate the place's popularity

Handmade prata dough and excellent curry and sambal, this place is my go to place for prata. Unlike other stalls that buy factory made dough, the owners make it themselves and the prata are crispy and fluffy. They also serve their prata with a sweet sambal which gives it another dimension. Do come early on weekends as the queue can be very very long. Oh they only do breakfast.
5
Wife n I always look for great prata in Singapore, always heard about this one but never made it till now.Choice of fish or mutton curry, very crispy. The lady was extremely kind and great service for a hawker stall, wonton Mee from stall next to it also goo

Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our "go to" food centres when we're in Singapore because of it's proximity to our lodging with family.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes but Mr and Mrs Moghan's Super Crispy Prata is well worth the wait.Prata is basically an unleavened bread that is expertly flipped near on like a pizza is and moulded until it has many thin layers of pastry, like a croissant. Prata is usually crispy and flaky on the outside, whilst remaining doughy on the inside. It makes a great breakfast, brunch or lunch but I can eat it any time of day and it is so incredibly more-ish. The Prata is always super crispy as promised in their name and the curry is always nice to dip the prata in, as is tradition. Although you can wait a little to find a seat, it's well worth it or you can always take away or Ta Pao in the local Singlish (Singapore/English) lingo.I'd also recommend that people look inside for seats too when seeking a seat as although it's a little warmer in the humidity of Singapore, quite often it's easier to sneak a seat and don't park illegally as you will most likely get a ticket.The little refreshments store serves up Iced Horlicks too which I can't help but get one every time we head there. I love the malty, milky goodness to kick off the day.Like anywhere in Singapore that serves at breakfast, I'd recommend getting there early as often places sell out

We arrived at 930 am on a Saturday and only got our pratas 50 minutes later.There was a large crowd at the stall, but there is no order queue per se. You place an order with the lady boss, who will note it down with a description of what you are wearing, then return in about 35 minutes to wait.You can see the pratas being made and it was amazing what people chose to include in theirs, such as mushrooms and cheese, as well as the amount of ghee/oil that is used - truly a sinful pleasure. We went for three egg and two plain pratas and they were very good and crispy, as advertised. There was a choice of either fish or mutton curries, both of which are delicious.There is a wonton noodles stall, as well as economic beehoon stall, both of which were also heavily patronised

Five stars, in deference to the mom+pop who have held on for all these years, sharing prata love with all. Not an easy find for those new to the estate, though. Your warm, crisp prata will not arrive in a minute, but that's because they don't just lift it off a tray of ready-made ones. A great eay to spend a morning is to get herr early with a friend, on bicycles, and order at least three
5
first things, first - no prata is good for you but it is darn great to eat.although we'd been walking passed the food centre on the corner of Crane and Onan Road for a few years we'd never thought about sampling the wares on offer. That was until we saw Mr & Mrs Mohgan's place features on an episode of KF Seetoh's Food Surprise or something. The first attempt ended in failure, they close early, Prata is a brekkie dish, but vowed to try again the following weekend. A word of warning, be prepared to wait on a Sunday, although it was relatively early the line was long (a good sign).We ordered one egg and one plain (costing about $2.50) and (very) soon realised this is clearly not enough for two (we had two other lunches that day) with both being really crispy but moist inside. The curry dipping sauce is just the right level of spice for breakfast (after several return trips I now smear the curry across the top of my egg prata). I recommend the egg prata.as an indication of the excellence of this place I took my fussy eating son here when he visited Singapore in the summer and even he loved it (although not the egg one, as he doesn't do egg)at the food centre there is also a great place for kopi whilst you wait
5
We have had the egg prata a few days in the row now. It is moist but yet crispy. Totally enjoyable. We noticed that even the birds were snacking on the crumbs and leftover curry that was not cleared quickly enough by the stall owners. The only challenge is the long line-ups but the lady owner meticulously writes down every order

I heard about this prata stall recently and its been on my mind ever since. One recent weekend, I couldn’t resist any longer and went to try. Its located at the Joo Chiat area, in a coffe shop at the bottom of a shophouse. The owner is hard at work, flipping and frying the prata, while his wife serves the hot prata to customers. I ordered the Plain Prata, Egg prata and prata plaster with egg. The standouts are:- Plain prata: Really crispy. Its good.- Prata plaster with egg: This is the plain prata with an fried egg on the outside of the prata. Love it when I cut into the egg yolk and the yolk flows over the prata. Nice! They wil give you the standard vegetable curry, but you can ask for fish curry, which has sardines and ikan bilis in it. I found the vegetable curry nice. There’s a constant flow of customers which shows the popularity of this stall. Recommended
