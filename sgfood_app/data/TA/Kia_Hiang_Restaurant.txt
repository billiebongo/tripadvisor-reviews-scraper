Popular with the long time tenants of International Plaza. It is a place where one can get local zi char at reasonable prices. Not too expensive too.

Savour local stir-fry favourites and their signature dishes in a comfortable air-conditioned setting. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable.

Claypot chicken is Kia Hiang's specialty for decades now, I heard from a local friend. So on our first lunch there, we had to order it and a few others - pork, beef, kaylan in garlic, omelette with eggplant. The claypot chicken in cabbage was good. Size is for sharing. So are the others, especially the pork dish. Everything we ordered was excellent. Too bad service didn't measure up. Perhaps some aunties need to undergo a refresher course on customer handling. The waitress and the cashier had little understand of CS. Hmm .

Everytime we visit Singapore, their outlet close to Tanjong Pagar station is the place we won't miss out. Their chicken is to die for! Try to have it with some omelette and also prawn roll with bacon. Lunch hour might get so busy. Dine for 2 will be proximately SGD 40-50. Chicken is at SGD18 per serving. Definitely a place you should try when in Singapore.

It's a very simple restaurant and it's a good place for lunch. I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The food is very simple and it's very similar to that you would get in a hawker center. The portions for some dish is generous and for some it's very small. It's always busy at lunch time though so be aware that there will be a queue. There is a service fee and they charge .50 for water. I don't think I would go back there again..

Me and my 6 colleagues decided to go International plaza for lunch yesterday and saw this not very fancy Chinese restaurant but crowded. Thus we thought the food must be good so we give it a try.Lucky for us that there were still 2 empty big tables left so we still managed to get a table.We ordered their specialty Claypot Chicken with cabbage, Bean sprouts, Omelette, Spicy Kangkong and Slice fish. Their rices are sold by plate but by headcount. 2nd serving of rice is free. All their dishes were tasty.I highly recommend the Claypot Chicken, the meat was so tendered and the taste was excellent. U will never regret ordering it. On average each of us spend around $15

As one of the oldest known Cantonese restaurants in Singapore, we expected the food to be exceptional! Bit our group of 6 were pretty disappointed with our lunch visit and order of the most touted claypot chicken with Chinese cabbage! Somehow the taste was a bit weird! Maybe the acquired taste was not ours! The fried toufu was pretty good but the fish fried with black bean sauce wasn't fresh at all! The sambal kangkong lacked the usual zing! Service was bad considering we had to chase the forgetful waitresses most of the time! Just wondering why the place is still crowded daily! Fengshui
