Coccogelo incorporated in Singapore, on March 2010. It is a newly established home-grown brand that will focus on selling artisan gelato as its primary product in addition to gourmet coffee, a series of frozen desserts and confectionery items. Gelato in Italian literally means "frozen”, the basic differences between Gelato and ice cream it doesn’t contain as much air, and is therefore more intense in flavour. In part, Gelato is healthier than ice cream since it is made with all natural ingredients and contains fewer calories and less butter fat.
