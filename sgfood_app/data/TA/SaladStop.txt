Lovely affordable selection of healthy food to make your own wrap. Limited seating but you cancer down if you get there early enough. Coffee and selection of healthy smoothies.

Very good salad and wrap. The wraps are good size, not small. Perfect to fill the hungry tummy. Salads are great too. and they have selections of juices, especially the berries ones are so good and refreshing. Sadly they don't make berries juices everyday.

As there is not a senayan city Jakarta review I'll make this the first one.200k idr for 2 people. Pricy but tasty. Staff are ok at both English and Indonesian. Quinoa salad very tasty. Jai ho salad is good but hardly any tandoori chicken was in the salad. Worth a visit but nothing overly special

This place is located in the basement in Tangs just beside Marriott Tangs on Orchard Road. Staff are alert and always smiling. The Tuna Salad and the Chihuahua Salad are most popular. My recommendation is Create Your own salad.The ingredients are super fresh and they have both done in and take away facilities with ample choices of sauces.Love the healthy drink options too. Great place to have some different healthy food
