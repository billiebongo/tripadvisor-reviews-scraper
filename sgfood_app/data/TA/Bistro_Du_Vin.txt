Came for a birthday dinner for my mom, I called ahead with special request and they were able to accommodate. Service was great from manager. Bread was warm and crusty, food was very good, wine was delicious - great visit!

Awesome authentic French food with excellent service by Naz and Freddy.
Naz surprised us with a nicely decorated birthday chocolate fondant dessert.. definitely coming back again

Love the extensive menu. Food is above average, with Onion Soup being the best of the bunch. Ribeye steak is rather chewy, but the Venison Tart is yummy. Apple tart is a must!

Good place to have a nice and quiet dinner without frills.
Great food, Great Service! The staff was attentive and quick.

First visit to Bistro Du Vin, and I will certainly be back again! Every dish that we ordered was delicious, I wish I had tummy space for more. Love the ambience of the restaurant and the warmth of the service.

A diner for two at our local area ... service by manager was ..,. Well we walked in and got asked to step aside ? As some guests who went out for a smoke came back into the restaurant. Oh well....Lobster bisque was delicious and rich .. yumThe pork terrine with pickle cornichons was well done .For mains we had steak frites N duckConfit. The steak was awesome with red wineJus. The duck confit was a tad dry n salty,We shared a dessert - STAR of the night - AppleTart with caramel sauce Food was good but service needs improvement for a restaurant and when you pay$100pp for dinner .
4
The onion soup is delicious with lots of cheese. The lobster bisque is on the light side. The duck confit is excellent. The veal is also good. The braised beef cheek is a little difficult to eat because it came in a pot and meat is slightly on the fatty side.The cold is good but I think the it is overpriced.As for dessert, the chocolate mousse is very good but the souffle is just so so.Service is very good though and will be a nice dining experience if the price is a little lower
5
I enjoyed every item that we ordered.First, the bread was served warm - the crust was firm and crispy (not hard) and the core was soft and warm.The bouillabaisse was light and appetising. It could use a bit more salt but the good thing is that you can taste the ingredients that go into it and not artificial seasoning.I was happy with my steak and fries as the meat was of acceptable quality, well prepared and the fries were perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by the side salad - it didn’t have the bitter after taste that you commonly get at most restaurants. Well done here.Finally, I would strongly recommend the baked alaskan. It’s a nice way to end the meal with especially when they are generous with the rum
3
The foe gras is nice and serves in big portion compared to other restaurants. The chicken is tasty and tender. However, the rest of the food and even desserts are average. The price is not cheap. I will not consider to patronise again because there are better food served in other restaurants in Singapore
5
I had passed the restaurant many times but always dismissed it because the name didn't make much sense in French. I'm glad I finally decided to give it a try because it was one of my best French meal in Singapore. I opted for the 2-dish chef's choice and he served me the cailette and the grand marnier soufflé - both were really good and the wine a perfect fit. However, I would recommend ordering a la carte, it would have been cheaper
4
May be the best bread and butter in town :p
Australian steak is okay. Daily special oysters are very fresh.
5
Went for lunch. The food was very tasty. There are set meals available on weekday lunch. Good service. Small and cosy place. Good for lunch meetings.
3
i had the pork cheek which was good, though slightly salty. the onion soup was legit. slightly pricey for the quality offered.

Got invited to a tasting at BDV thanks to Burpple. Had the privilege of sitting next to Merissa, the Marcomms Assistant Manager for Les Amis. 2 things she said resonated very strongly with me: “Don’t eat too much bread; it’s good, but you need to save stomach space”, & “come with friends so you can share a good variety; the more, the merrier” (some dishes are so rich & flavourful that it might be too much to finish on your own). Wise words of wisdom.(Anything with a ✨ indicates it is part of the special menu, while stocks last )[APPETIZERS]Foie gras poêlé ($28) - Pan-seared foie gras, griottes cherry in Armagnac, poultry juiceI’d never paired foie gras with a fruit before; it surprised me & I liked it. The sweetness of the griottes cherries cuts through the creaminess of the pan-seared foie gras (a sizeable portion right there), making it less jelak than it would be on its own. A match made in heaven.--Tarte de sardines ($22) - Brittany sardines, tomatoes & basil warm tartIt doesn’t look like much, but the flavours of this appetizer were so harmonious in my mouth! Maybe because when I think of sardines, I think of extreme fishyness in a can, drowning in intense tomato sauce— too vinegary, sour, & fishy.But this appetizer has everything in good proportion; the Brittany sardines were NOT overly fishy, & there was no overpowering taste of vinegar or tomatoes. Served on a warm tart (with a layer of basil spread in between), everything blended together nicely.. The perfect savoury flaky pastry. --Bisque de homard ($20) - French lobster bisque, croutons, cheese & rouille sauce✨ Oeuf Meurette ($17) - red wine sauce, soft boiled egg, croutons, lardon✨ Home-made duck terrine with hazelnut & green salad ($22)Assiette de charcuteries ($30) - French cold cuts selection: smoked duck breast, homemade rillettes or terrine, ham & saucisson--[MAIN COURSES]✨ Hand cut "Paris style" steak tartare with fries & salad ($35)Not on the regular menu, so grab it while stocks last! This hand cut "Paris style" steak tartare might be too adventurous for those who dislike raw food— but if you’re open to new culinary experiences, once you try it, you might get hooked ;) Our eyes gleamed with joy as we watched Philippe mix the yolk in with the beef, & added a splash of Calvados to it to make it complete. Not meant to be devoured, but rather savoured a little at time with the fries & salad that accompanies it.--✨ Beef wellington, foie gras with baby vegetables & australia black truffle sauce ($52) Another item off the special menu— dare I say this is my absolute FAVOURITE dish of the night. I don’t even know where to start. Perfectly juicy beef wrapped in a puff pastry. Foie Gras & Black Truffle Sauce. I don’t think I need to say more. While it IS more expensive than the other mains, it is well worth it. (My picture doesn’t even do it justice)--Risotto de homard ($39) - Lobster tail risotto & baby vegetablesYou need to eat this quickly, because when it gets cold, it tends to get clumpy. So we took our pictures hurriedly & excitedly tucked in. The lobster tail was tender & bouncy, & the risotto was honestly an explosion of thick lobstery goodness in my mouth.I am used to more subtle seafood flavours; this is very rich, so I don’t know if it’d be everyone’s cup of tea. Once again, I reiterate— come here with friends; you’ll get more variety, & you’re able to eat smaller portions!--✨ Lamb saddle stuffed with bacon & sage, with mashed potato & ratatouille ($38)Confit de canard ($32) - Duck leg confit, Salardaise potatoes & green saladJoue de bœuf braisée Grande-Mère ($35) - Braised beef cheek "Grande-Mère", bacon & mashed potatoesCôte de porc grillée ($35) - Char-grilled pork chop with Corsica Lonzo pork loin, potato gratin & baby vegetablesJoue de bœuf braisée Grande-Mère ($35) - Braised beef cheek "Grande-Mère", bacon & mashed potatoes--As stuffed as we were (6 appetizers & 7 mains later), we still had room for dessert!--[DESSERTS]Mousse au chocolat ($12) - Valrhona 72% chocolate mousseThis was a shocker— I have NEVER liked mousse in my life. I was confused when I took my first bite of this. Then I had another mouthful to ascertain my true feelings for this— I then decided that I absolutely LOVE it. It is thick, heavenly, & how can you not love 72% Valrhona chocolate?I guess I never had good mousse before... Until today.--Tarte fine aux pommes ($12) - Warm thin apple tart, vanilla ice creamApple Tart done right! Nicely flaky, & not too soggy even after the ice cream has melted on it (i.e. towards the end). I would’ve loved for the vanilla flavour in the ice cream to be stronger & the ice cream itself less sweet—but I must say, this was already good.--Soufflé au Grand-Marnier ($18) - Grand-Marnier soufflé, choice of ice creamLight & fluffy, not too sweet, perfect with the accompanying ice cream. --Crème brûlée ($10) - Traditional vanilla crème brûlée✨ Mille-feuille of berries & vanilla ($14)Fondant au chocolat ($16) - Hot chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream[WINES]Ringenbach & Fils Gewürztraminer (2014), a white wine. Hecht And Bannier Saint Chinian (2011), a red wine. Domaine de Durban Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise (2008), a dessert wine.My favourite is a toss-up between the red & the white, as I’m really not a fan of dessert wine (sorry). Both were excellent! The red was full-bodied, wasn’t too spicy, & had vibrant black fruit flavours that linger for a while on the tongue. The white was fragrant & floral, & most importantly not too sweet; very easy to drink

Visited this place once, hope in future will visit again. After one month of "eastern" food i wanted to taste something from "home" - European.Me and my colleague choose this it was not so far away from our hotel and we do not make mistake.Ovner of this bistro was very frendly, communcation was outstandig and carrying for customer it was on his first place.Food was exactely like i wanted and glass of vine was perfect.Regarding the vine, i was only express my wish to owner and he pick up the vine, it was excellent choice. All the best for this bistro and his leading person

Stepping into Bistro du Vin was so reminiscent of the Parisian cafes and restaurants we had dined in during our 3-week visit to France earlier in the year. The decor and ambiance brought back sentiments of the enjoyable meal times we had both in Paris and in other towns in the country. We were well received and seated and bread and water served promptly, similar to the commonplace practice in France. It was good to hear all the classic old French songs playing as well. We opted for the Menu de Midi which is the set lunch. My husband and I had the Mushroom Veloute (soup) which was hearty and tasty. My son chose the Baked Camembert (cheese) with black truffle & bacon salsa which was excellent. My elderly mother did not seem keen on any of the entree options being that she has a limited palate so we decided to order the Homemade Duck Rillette to share. When it arrived and was placed in front of her, she tucked right in without a second thought and finished it all up quite heartily, much to our surprise. Proof that it was delicious indeed. For mains, my mother and I had the Beef Bourguinon, which was good although I would have preferred a little more of the gravy. My husband had the Vegetarian Ravioles De Royans with Ratatouille which he enjoyed. The Duck Confit which my son ordered was very good (albeit a touch overdone) and the meat fell off the bone nicely but it looked very dull in appearance. I think it should have been accompanied by a small portion of vegetables or salad or some form of garnish to at least be more appealing to the eyes. We did note that there are other side options one can order but each plate should still have some colour for presentation. The desserts were the highlight. The Hazelnut parfait which my mother and I had were sooo good. My son was also impressed with his order of Varlhona chocolate & caramel tart with raspberry sorbet; the sorbet bringing a refreshing sourness after a rich meal. My husband had his usual Creme Brulee which equaled in taste and texture to most of the ones he had in France. Overall, the meal was more than we expected and the service was both warm and attentive. The Happy Birthday writing on my dessert plate was beautiful and one of the best chocolate penmanship I have seen so far. I will definitely want to dine here again for lunch and have already recommended Bistro du Vin to a few of my French colleagues. The owner/manager said 'Au Revoir' and 'A Bientot' to us as we left and likewise, I do hope my next visit will not be too far in the future. To the kind waitstaff; 'Thank you for making my special day so memorable'. Do note however that lunch hours are from 12 to 2 pm only

This bistro is located within walking distance from Great World City mall; just required to cross the main road (you will not miss the bistro). The service crew (mainly young men) are helpful to recommend dishes to us. Not all dishes are to our liking but overall, pretty good reco from them. I ordered a french onion soup (too salty for my liking), the chicken dish with mash potato & my personal favourite, the dessert; hazelnut parfait with chocolate sauce (2 thumbs up). I would definitely return to try other dishes on the menu
5
The set lunch was affordable and tasty. Both my friend and I had cod and it was very fresh. The serving was just nice and the food was tasty. My Friend loved their onion soup. I loved their desserts. Service was attentive and we were well looked after during our meal.

I just moved in Singapore 2 weeks ago and have been exploring restos around my condo. I was so happy to find Bistro Du Vin, a charming little French resto with friendly staff and classic French menu plus good assortment of wine, in the River Valley area. Happy to see that they have seared foie gras and escargot. Now I know where to go when I am suddenly craving for seared foie! Last night I ordered the spring chicken with mushrooms, bacon, and mashed potato. It was delicate and tasty. I really enjoyed it! Will definitely go back to try the other good stuff in the menu next week!

Celebrating birthday with a friend over 3 course lunch meal at 33bucks, that came with appetizer, main course and dessert. The mushroom soup with truffle oil was fragrant and tasty. The duck confeit that i had was soft as it melted once i tasted it, really nicely prepared. Frozen hazelnut meringue with chocolate sauce as dessert was a nice end to the meal
5
Decided to drop by for late dinner. Am promptly lead to a table. Had terrine of foie gras, salad tomatoes, Japanese seabream and Apple tart. Great meals and had a glass of their house champagne- Bruno paillard!
3
I went here for a business dinner because it was highly rated. The wine was wonderful but I was dissapointed by the steak which was a bit tough.
5
Very nice bistrot , typical French bistrot lyonnaise , absolutely good , the duck Rillette is so testy .he have a great french wine selection , I recommend it !
5
Attend a dinner with group of friends. All the dishes from Appetisers and main course is wonderfully prepared. I especially like the Le Confit De Canard which Is Duck Leg confit with Pommery mustard mash mesclun salad.
The staff are friendly & attentive.
5
Had a birthday dinner celebration with friends.
Impressed with how attentive all the staff are. Never once do I try to get the attention of any of them to refill my water or change the plate.
The food, it's Awesome!!!!
Definitely worth visiting again. :)

I took a lovely lady to dinner last night, Friday 28 July 2016. The Restaurant Manager was the ONLY good part of the experience. He was affable, and great to chat with.I am a Top level 6 Reviewer on TripAdvisor. I am a retired senior military officer who travels the World throughout the year tracking my investments. I have eaten at thousands of restaurants in over 60 countries.The prices I quote here include Gratuity and GST. $7.65 for a skinny glass packed full of ice with 15 ml of cranberry concentrate and 75 ml of water is outrageous. The drink was an embarrassment to any restaurant.The service by various staff was lacklustre at best and lazy at worst. There was never an "excuse me" by any staff. They just reached across us when we were talking as if we weren't there.The Menu Board that was plonked on a table with no style, was written months ago and was barely readable - so amateur.. Similarly, the large blackboard menu had been written by someone who cared less for neatness or explanationNo coasters under glasses of chilled water so when the glasses were raised to drink from, we were covered in drips of cold condensate.Just over $20.00 a BOWL for a "nice" mushroom soup but nothing I could not make at home myself. $20.00! This is not a 5 Star Restaurant - far from it.The scallops were just okay but who, today, after so many complaints over the last ten years about ridiculously small portion sizes, serves 4 tiny scallops on a huge plate, swimming in a very average sauce. $28.25!My duck. A joke. I have had better duck at the Outram Park MRT for under $4.00. The duck was not fresh, and I would say it may have even been cooked the day before and reheated. It was nearly burnt on the outside and was tough and difficult to cut, even with the supplied sharp knife. The mash tasted like Instant Potato flakes. The salad came straight from a Cold Storage Pre-packed salad bag!My dining partner and I were not impressed.I do not want to come back. She does not want to return either.Thankyou for ruining an otherwise lovely evening
4
The duck leg confit was a tad bit too dry for my liking and the tossed salad was too salty. Apart from that, we enjoyed the Prime Rib quite a fair bit, and the onion soup was great.Like everyone else said, the service was great and staff were attentive to your needs
4
If you crave some French relaxed atmosphere, this is the place to go and for me you get these onion soup in Singapore. Totally authentic with lots of baked cheese. If you love French onion soup, you won't be disappointed. I had as well the pan fried foie gras and it was also very delicious. Overall nice menu and I love how the place is so tugged away from the busy street.
4
The cold cut platter was great consisted of house made cured duck, pate, ham, salami accompanied by brioche. Followed by nicoise salad and 2 main dishes: iberico fillet with mustard and sweet wine sauce, and casserole of beef cheek. Great relax lunch with a bottle of pinot noir.
5
First time dining there and was an invitation by a friend to celebrate his birthday. All the staffs were very attentive and service was very prompt and takes initiative without being asked to requested, for instance, refilling of ice water. The food quality was really very good. From the starter of the platter, to the pan seared Hokkaido scallop with seaweed butter sauce, the the highlight which is the main course. I had the beef stew and it was so good, love the mashed potato as it is creamy and smooth. Will definitely come back for more!Thanks to the crew for making our evening memorable
5
Had a wonderful dinner out - romantic and intimate restaurant with character and great food. Daily specials seem the best value.
4
I went to Bistro Du Vin with a few colleagues. I found the food very good and the serve staff attaentive a polite. They have a nice range of wine too.
4
My wife and I met another couple here for dinner. The restaurant is small like a French cafe and was hosting a large Christmas party. Nevertheless, very nice evening with excellent food--duck and roasted chicken were particularly good. By Singapore standards reasonably good value and service. Manager jumped in to push along our main course and fill our empty glasses. Nice evening and look forward to returning.
4
Come here with an appetite. This is my first time at Zion (had tried the branch along Scotts Road thrice) and I am not disappointed. The Beef Bourguignone delights; the duck confit done to perfection. Service is warm and helpful. Reservations recommended for this Les Amis Group restaurant
5
The setting is quite French (according to my stay in France for 6 months years ago). The service is super, especially from their director from France. The foir gras entree, salmon, chocolate tart are very delicious. This place is only 10 mins drive from both Orchard and city, but quiet and nice
2
We stopped for a snack. I had a glass of wine. My husband decided to have 2 beers. We shared a plate of charcuterie jambon et saucisson and paid over 90 SGD. The meal was good, but nothing special at all. Particularly irritating fact is that the menu for Zion Road offers "half a glass of wine" which I assumed was the price of one glass of wine. Saying that I never heard of any places selling half glass of anything. Silly, and in my opinion designed to trick customers. So, if you wish to pay 21SGD for one whole glass (150ml) of Sancerre it must be your place. Service is of course included in the bill.
4
My wife and I ate here as part of a large (12 people) group of family and friends. My wife and I ate escargots and the lamb shank and shared a chocolate dessert, The food was unmistakeably French (as it should be!), of a high quality and delicious. The rest of the group had a variety of dishes from the menu and all reported that their food was of a very high standard and well presented. The wine list was OK and the merlot we drank was serviceable (but drinks prices are expensive ...like everywhere in Singapore). Service was friendly and efficient and we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening
5
Fiona and I come here every couple of weeks for date night, it's very cosy and always has a nice busy buzz to it. The staff are attentive and friendly and always smiling.We love this place because of the French Onion Soup as it reminds us of the soup we had while we were courting in Chamonix.We always have a glass of the house champagne to start then I have the French Onion Soup and follow that with the Confit Duck and a glass of Burgundy selected by Phillippe Pau the host.We always share a desert and usually keep it classic and order the Souffle or the Creme Caramel, both are divine
5
Despite living close by we have never went even though we are often in great world city. I had already heard this was a good place to eat so booked to go with a friend on Friday evening. And glad that I had booked as there were no tables free come 8-9pm and folks being turned away. Menu was very traditional French but the surprise was that there was a great specials board with extras like octopus, sea bass and my personal favourite blood sausage. The scallops and liver starters were very well done and full of flavour. Both main courses were good sized portions and the duck was cooked perfectly rare and very tasty. Great wine list to choose from mostly French of course. Will be back for sure and will need to try the set lunch. That manager who was French was very friendly and helpful and the staff were very good by Singapore standards especially
4
The service was good. We made a reservation and we were seated in a short while. Then when come to ordering, The boss of the bistro took our order and served us. I personally like the duck confit. It was very good. I will definitely go back for dinner again
4
One of our family's favourite. Not fine dining but similar to what you would find in a good bistrot in France. Very authentic, esp the casserole dishes, chèvre chaud and soufflé.
Bravo au chef et restaurateur.
4
This restaurant has great ambiance and the food is quite good as well. There is a nice well priced wine list, the floor manager is great but the wait staff can be a bit hit and miss.
4
Beautiful food, awesome vibe and great service! Will definitely go back when I go to Singapore again! Will recommend it to anyone who visits near Zion street
4
Came one night with friends when we had a craving for foie gras. It was our first time to Bistro and service was pleasant.The foie gras appetizer was nicely done and the escargots were very tasty. For the entrees, everything was good as well. It was a high quality traditional fare
4
Service was good and food was okay. Given the price of the food, I was anticipating the food to be something more. For the food, while it tastes alright, I don't think it's worth the price. I love escargots, but theirs was filled with veg that's too strong for my taste. But we thought that the fries, mashed potato and Chocolate Fondant was nice. We requested for a cake for my sister during reservation as we are celebrating her birthday and she was served with the chocolate fondant. However for those who are expecting the cake to be on the house, it is actually included in our bill.For a dinner of 4, with a bottle of red wine, the total bill was almost $350.
4
Asked a friend to recommend a good place for steak and chips, and this is where we ended up. A welcoming place with attentive, friendly staff and a decent selection. Nice pint of Kronenbourg 1664 to start with.Shared a cote du boeuf with my son, the carnivore, and it was excellent - cooked rare as we'd ordered it, and nicely accompanied by a vinaigrette dressed salad, some great green beans and lovely fluffy mash. Didn't enjoy the chips or the bearnaise sauce quite so much, but no matter.But the real triumph of the evening was the pork rillettes to start - even my son, who's a fussy eater, admitted it was "really good" and he wants to go back so he can order his own next time! The French onion soup on nearby tables looked very tempting too.It's not France, but it's a very good approximation, and there were French diners on tables around us, which must be a good sign - we'll definitely be going back
4
Warm and inviting french bistro. Nice range in menu and lots of specials on the chalk board. They have special lunch set menus at a good price. Being our first visit we wanted to try as much from the menu and specials. For the two of us, we shared a french onion soup, Baked Burgundian escargots, Pan-seared Foie Gras with pickled eggplant and onions, pan-seared scallops, duck leg confit, seafood bouillabaise and finished off with a creme brulee.The kitchen will seperate the sup for two with an additional charge of $2. The sup was good and hearty. Escargots needed salt as I had a feeling someone forgot to salt this dish, still good nonetheless. Loved the foie gras and thought the pickled eggplant and onions went really well together. Did with they were thicker cuts though. Scallops were succulent, browned well and cooked just nice in the middle. The mains however were mediocre but came in very big portions. The duck wasnt as light and crisp as i would have prefered. It came with a side of homemade baked beans and was surprised by the texture expecting canned ones that were usually soft and mushy. Have definitely tasted better version of this dish. The seafood stew was decent but since different sized mussels were used, the smaller ones became over cooked and tough. Seafood could be fresher but an ok dish overall. Loved the creme brulee with its thin crust and vanilla beans dotting the bottom. Will definitely be back to try more of their other dishes and desserts. Great place to chill with friends or family
4
The extensive menu (and the long list of specials each day) has lots of the French classics, all well executed (okay, certain dishes may not be top notch; for example, the celeriac mash could be a bit smoother, etc, but overall quality is better than at many more expensive French restaurants in town). The lunch menu is of exceptional value, otherwise the à-la-carte prices are also quite reasonable. The wine list also has value in mind (eg. offering 'second wines' from Bordeaux grands crus classés). The acoustics at the Zion location is better than at the Shaw Centre original (where it can get quite noisy). Friendly service (although the younger waiters tend to be a bit clueless, but that's a general problem on the Singapore restaurant scene)
5
Very nice restaurant with a nice deco, service is efficient, and wine list is good also.Philippe, the director is extremely friendly and size of plates are very good.As French, I would say it is a good Bistrot to enjoy classical french meals.Price are not crazy alsoMay be have more fish in the menu...there is a terrasse also for evening diner and smoker...

Came here thinking it would be a great new addition to our neighborhood favorite list. We have been passing by here often thinking it would be a cute place for dinner and finally gave it a try. Everything was going fine, until a large cockroach started crawling down the bench the runs through the entire restaurant. It caused a huge disturbance to everyone in the restaurant who had to get up out of their seats as it went from one side of the restaurant to the other passing over people's legs. The restaurant staff was completely unfazed. They barely did anything to try to kill it and my boyfriend had to kill it himself as it climbed back over a divider and was hit off of a woman's shirt. Our main entrees hadn't even been served yet, and needless to say, we were no longer hungry. The staff did not apologize for the incident, offer anything as consolation, offer to take anything off the bill, nothing. Singapore service is notoriously bad, but really, this was on a whole other level. The level of causality in dealing with the problem leads me to think this is a recurring roach problem the restaurant has. After the incident, the staff even came to tell us "the kitchen is closing, do you want to order anything else?" Ummmm, NO! And I will not ever be coming back
5
We have been here a few times, and most recently for Mrs R's birthday last month. We had a couple of pre-dinner drinks elsewhere and arrived just on the dot for our reservation. We were whisked off to our table and presented with menus and the wine list.I ordered a glass of white for my menu perusal and I knew we would need a bottle of red and I picked a Ch De Sales, which under $100 was, I thought, a result.The birthday girl went for foie gras and the Golden Trout from the blackboard while I chose the onion soup and a steak, medium rare, with truffle mashed spuds.The restaurant was reasonably busy considering it was Boxing Day, but the service was good. The crowd was the usual mix of locals and expats, and a decent number of the expat voices to be heard were speaking French which I always think is a good sign. I go to France a lot, and I know the French are very particular about their food: second best is never good enough so any French restaurant in Singapore with a regular French clientele is doing something right.The food arrived and we tucked into our starters. The foie gras was perfectly cooked, a nice crust on the outside and creamy soft inside, while my soup was equally perfect, deep rich stock with tons of caramelised onions and a smothering of melted cheese on the crouton.After a respectable interval during which we leisurly chewed the fat and watched the restaurant at work, our mains arrived.I cannot speak for the trout, not taking seafood at all but I was advised it was good, if a little large for a petite Asian diner.My steak was great, well cooked rib eye, and mash with just the right degree of truffliness and none of it lasted very long.Neither of us felt a dessert would be necessary having eaten far too much over the previous week or so we just summoned the bill and grabbed a passing cab to head home.Very good and I cannot wait for my dry January to be over so we can go back
5
AMAZING I tried it the first time at the end of last year and since that I'm visiting this place once/twice every month. Difficult to write what isn't good. Everything it's top from the food ( onion soup, lobster bisque, foie gras braised beef, duck confit, rack of lamb....the tarte tatin DELICIOUS) to the drinks ( there are some not so expensive good wines, my favourites bordeaux and riesling. Also the service is very good, always there when you need them. A Must
5
The reason I came back to this restaurant was because I needed a very good dinner to relax my mind after a hard week at work and I must say Bistro Du Vin never disappoints!The foie gras was perfectly seared and served with caramelized pearl onion and egg plant with balsamic vinegar; it just brought me to heaven!I had Shepherd pie as my main course and it was very lovely baked and it was delicious!I had grand manier soufflé and vanilla ice cream as dessert; perfect dessert to end the dinner. I would recommend my friends to come to this restaurant

During a visit to Singapore, a friend suggested we meet at this establishment for lunch. It is nestled in a row of shop houses across from Great World city and as soon as you enter, you know that some thought, and I mean some serious thought has gone into creating a slice of Paris right here in Singapore. From the furniture, to the color of the walls and the posters all framed beautifully, it resembles something from the Marais. (Well close enough).The lunch menu comes in at $26 per head and you receive three courses. An app, a main, desert or cheese and tea or coffee. I had the escargot on a fried egg with what I believe was a red wine emulsion, followed that up with a sea food soup that had some much fresh sea food in it I thought I was dreaming and then I had some cheese with figs. All this was washed down with 2003 Saint Emilion Grand Cru ( yes the vintage was a difficult one but this one was simply amazing - a well balanced fruit driven delight served at a perfect temp.)The bill for two of us with service and tax was $60 and I honestly do not know where on earth you can get this quality of food for this price point. I have read the other comments and respect their opinions but if you have such discerning tastes for French cuisine, then head out to something that is going to cost you at least 5 times more. So I recommend this place to anyone in Singapore looking for a good meal

This is quite a nice, comfortable bistro to go to, which makes it a pity that the food was not particularly appealing. The atmosphere is warm and casual, a nice place to have a family dinner or to catch up with friends. We had dinner there, and between us we had the pan seared foie grass and the duck confit. The foie gras was a decent sized portion and the first few bites were pleasant but the large amount of olive oil drizzled on the plate together with the rather odd tasting pickled eggplant did not do anything to complement the foie gras. Presentation was also rather depressing. The Duck confit - rather small portion, dry and too salty. Again, presentation was lacking - very brown and dull looking on the plate.Pity about the food, given all the good reviews that this place has received before. Perhaps it was not a good day - but the quietness of the place on a Saturday night should have clued us in as well

I was in a group of 4 who tried out the 3 course dinner menu. Appetizer 1 was an escargot dish served in a swirling pool of sunny side up eggs, bacon and a very strong cream sauce. The presentation was appalling! Why serve a horrible runny mash of strong sauces/tastes, and a broken sunny side up egg? Where is the culinary pride in that? Sadly the escargot which was supposed to be the focus was lost in the dish. Appetizer 2 was a foie gras ravioi, submerged totally under a dubious looking brown sauce. Taste was ok but presentation was horrible. Where is the visual element to the dish? At least a sprig of italian parsley or some kind of garnish would have spruced the dish up. And lastly, why serve the appetizers on such a small side plate? Main course 1 was a seafood chowder, which was ok while Main course 2 was a beef short ribs with mash. They were ok but once again presentation was lacking. The worst dish for the entire evening had to be the blue cheese ice cream on a pear tart. Did the kitchen staff even taste the ice cream???? I consider myself somewhat a fan of blue cheeses, but blue cheese and ice cream simply does not go together! The end product was a salty mess served on top of a pear tart bought from the Bread Talk at Great World City opposite that was just too difficult to stomach. I strongly suggest that the Executive Chef of the group has a taste of the horrible blue cheese ice cream

To be fair, we had the set lunch, so most places would cut corners, and this place sure didThe bread was hard and cheap tasting, and my gums hurt. My iberico ham starter was 2 tiny slivers, and my gums hurt again with the bread that came with it. My friend's foie gras appeared decent, but came with an $8 supplement. Our duck confit main was ok, and my friend noted it was small. His apple tart dessert actually looked good. My cheese plate was a tiny sliver of camerbert. Tea and coffee were in the set, so that was okOverall, the lunch set wasn't expensive, but so many corners were cut i was left wondering if i should risk it and return for dinner to experience the realBistro du vi

This was a our first visit to Bistro du Vin @ Zion. The atmosphere here is wonderful, and feels just like a real bistro. The vibe is a bit more relaxed than their Scotts Road location. I started our dinner grilled sardines with lemon and garlic, followed by a very nice rib eye and frites (We are in Singapore, so the frites could be improved). The wine list is mostly French wine, with many wines from lesser known regions in France. In contrast to other restaurants in Singapore, Bistro du Vin has very good service, with attentive and polite staff. We would definitely go back again

Great for a really satisfying and filling French meal at reasonable prices in Singapore, which is not a common thing. The duck confit, lamb shank and steak were superb and very filling. The crème brulee was one of the best in Singapore at the price. Sunday evenings are a good time to go if you want to get a table easily and avoid the crowds. It is almost impossible to get a reservation for Friday and Saturdays, even if you offer to sit in the al fresco area

Unpretentious restaurant serving French Food in a cozy setting made for a delightful lunch with friends. Reasonably priced if you're craving French cuisine for a change.

Had a pleasant dinner here last night. Was impressed earlier with the good set lunch so decided to head back for dinner. The bread was warmed to a lovely crisp and not too hard like in many places. The pan-fried foie gras was delightful and not too filling. My angus ribeye was done just right (most places tend to overdo their medium-rates) ... moist and tasty. Sampled the snapper and onion soup and that was good too. Overall, it's was a good experience with efficient service in a really cosy ambience that's pretty reminiscent of our experiences in a typical bistro in France.

The brasserie is a small but cosy restaurant. We went at the weekend and it was buzzing. I would not go there for a romantic dinner but great with friends or family. Reservations necessary.Food Is very good, - real hearty French food with decent portion sizes. Also able to order wine by glass or carafe. Well chosen house pours. Service was really excellent. Everyone was knowledgable about the food and wine, staff were friendly, polite and efficient. I put an average for value, which is generally what i do for most restaurants in singapore. Typical prices , its hard to find a restaurant thats really great value. We would definately go back.Valet is available but its $10. I assumed it was free.. Silly me!. Alternatively park at Great World

Have been here several times and it is a good choice for no nonsense French bistro style food. Excellent portion sizes, consistently well cooked. Everything is good here but we particularly like the onion soup, duck and suckling pig leg confit, rib eye and cote de boeuf. The is our favourite dessert

This place works for me and my wife. Not pretentious like other Les Amis Group place and provides qood quality food at a decent price. Agree with comments on the beef cheek, excellent- don't burn your tongue tho"! Wine selection pretty good. Parking - make things easy use Great World City and walk over

I am definitely not a French food connoisseur but I know when I like something. I tasted the French onion soup and the beef cheek. Both were amazing! We had a large group of about 10 and we had good service. Prices were reasonable and the portions were nice size...large even. Also, you can bring your own wine with a corkage fee which is waved if you buy a bottle from the restaurant. We had a great time over great food! I will definitely be back

i was a bit cautious at first, as the place was quiet while the italian next door was really crowded... but actually this turned out to be a very decent french bistrot! the food is genuine, the atmosphere inside very typical french, and the price ok - i would rate it in the same range as taratata bistrot. very good cold platter, and definitely try their slow cooked lamb shank, you will thank me for that.ps: avoid the italian 'peperoni' next door... it s crowded because of the snail service. cheap, but noisy and soooo slow, you ll regret it after 45min waiting for your pizza

Five of us went to Bistro Du Vin at Zion Road for dinner. We ordered the French onion soup, the baked Burgundian escargots, the oven-baked spring chicken served with sautéed button mushroom and bacon, the duck leg confit with leek-pommery mash, the pan-roasted Yorkshire pork chop with caramelized shallot, garlic and mashed potato, the slow-cooked lamb shank with white onion, tomatoes and crushed potatoes, and the beef cheek braised in red wine with carrot, mushroom, pearl onion, bacon and mashed potato.For dessert, we had the crème brulee, the baked banana wrapped in pastry, almond and chocolate mousse, and two home-made ice-creams and sorbets.All the dishes were delicious. The duck leg confit and the lamb shank were very tasty. The beef cheek was tender but a little salty. The food portions were big.The decor was typical of a French bistro, with posters and photographs hanging on the walls. The lighting was a bit dim.Service was good, although at times we had to wave to catch our server’s attention.We had a great dinner and will come back again. Bistro Du Vin is one of the restaurants under the Le Amis Group. The bistro is located at 56 Zion Road, opposite Great World City

Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday here with friends and we had an table inside. The place is just across from Great World City. The decor is really authentic French bistro and feels romantic. The waiter told us the farm tools hanging from the ceiling were all from France. Recommend the truffle fries and beef cheek in red white. Mashed potato was delicious too
