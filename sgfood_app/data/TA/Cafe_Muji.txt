Self-service. Ordered the Christmas special and was disappointed when the portion size looked so small as compared to what was advertised. Not worth $30.

Food was alright I suppose, but service was excruciatingly slow and staff couldn't communicate well.

I had such a good experience during my first visit that I couldn't wait to come for the second time. Food and concept was as l like it. Simple, fresh, a fusion of Japanese simplicity and the freshness of healthy ingredient. Maybe it was during the lunch time this time and the crew was a little off. They meant well but the setup is not working for them. After queuing to order my food, I was told that I must get a table first. There was no way to get a table since I don't have a bag, or an umbrella to reserve a table. A well manner staff helped to get a card for this purpose and reserve a seat for me. I join the queue again only to find someone just taking over my seat, disregarding the card. The queue to pay was getting long because the cashier also have to make the drinks, another came to help but she don't speak English well, so there were delay. After all the fuss, I managed to still find a seat to enjoy my lunch
