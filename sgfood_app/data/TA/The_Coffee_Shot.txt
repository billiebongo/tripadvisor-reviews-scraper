Good place to stay for long to study or work. It's not crowded. While there are quite a few cafes in Lavender area, it's the one of the most favorite.

The place is nice and cosy. The thin crust pizza was quite nice. I had berries smoothie while my friend had ice coffee and it tasted quite good but I think for the price, it is too small a glass. Staff was friendly.

Seems to have a large student clientele. The coffee is all right, reasonably priced as far as these things go in Singapore. Not a bad place to rest your feet if you are in the area. They offer free wifi.

Quiet, great service, amazing coffee, blazing fast WiFi, huge teddy bear, chocolate biscuits, lots of electrical outlets for your laptop and ipad, books, and, again, quiet - definitely not your crazy, music-blasting starbucks clone.

A bit pricey but worth the penny. Good place and good food, not to mention the service qualtiy. The ice black forest is worth to try.

Cozy atmosphere with beautiful songs, suitable for chatting with friends or even a small group meeting (out of the office).Love the coffee, smooth and tastyâ€¦ next visit, I would like to have the cheese cake.Good service, staff are friendly and able to introduce different coffees to you

The headline of this review basically tells you everything. I loved the Swedish meatballs and the mango juice drink. Not bad for the price at all. The internet was really the most remarkable. Maybe because I live in Myanmar, where the internet isn't all that great, but I was blown away at how fast it was - I got so much work done here

Most cafes for "getting work done" are overcrowded with loud music. This place is a first for me, with not more than three or four tables filled. There are sufficient power outlets and WiFi. Dla very good place to have a chat or get work done for sure. Coffee and tea is usual, cakes are good. Have not tried the food as of yet, but I generally do not believe in cafe food in Singapore. Let's stick to what a cafe does best. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area!

Rule 1: always serve food at the same time. That is why people have brunch together - not to watch each other eat. Waited 45 mins to get our food and staff is not even apologetic. Continues to argue with me over the counter. The place is not even crowded. Food ($16-$18) is not fantastic. Eggs not poached well and food is cold. Constant sound of microwaving which bugs me. $17 average to eat microwaved food. The toast are thin and hard. Ambience is nice. Quiet. Radio, please fix that signal. Not coming back. Plenty of better cafes in the proximity.

Nicely-decorated cafe along Lavender Rd, with some long sofa and couches to chill. Some coffee gunny sacks are hung on the walls too. Coffee is great, especially the flat white and mocha :)Green Tea cake is unique, adds a nice twist to go with the coffee!Free wifi is a bonus. Prices are reasonable, and no additional service charge or GST
