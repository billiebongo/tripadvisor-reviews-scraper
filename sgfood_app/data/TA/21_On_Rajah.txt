Food is good. Would have been better with a more wider choices. Friendly staffs. Definitely tasty food.
5
It more than what we expected. The spreads are wonderful and delightful. Best on Saturdays and Sundays and you can enjoy the bunch. Hope to come back again.
4
Place pleasantly atmosphered with not a bad spread. Enjoyed the stay as Sis birthday bash with the kids
5
Dined in a few days back for pre Valentine's with my better half. Great food and all but the one person who stood out was your staff Li Yan. She made us feel at home and treated us very genuinely n sincerely. With the great spread all around, personally I love the chocolate fondue .. n an incredible staff like Li Yan.. we can't say more but that we ll be back soon.. :
5
Wide spread of good choice of food , every food is full of flavour in it . My personal favourite is the mee, simply superb!!! & the durian mousse is to die for. The chef never fail to tantalize your taste buds :)) excellent . Perfect table setting & prompt service from the staff . The Restuarant manager Ms Nan made it a pleasant dine in for us
4
The most outstanding dishes are the laksa and the mee goreng. Very lemak and tasty !For the dessert, the coconut kuehs are very delicious too.Areas of improvement would include more food and fruit choices ; introduce more desserts such as pulut itam, tau suan and durian penget - will surely add more marks to the rating !Ambience is simple like ‚Äòcanteen‚Äô style
4
Their year-long promotion of 50% off for Seniors above 50 years old makes this all the more a reason for families to get together with elderly parents to join in for a great meal! The ambience has this "at home" feel, good lighting, clean environment and sturdy tables and chairs. I would have given a perfect rating if the buffet spread was a little bit more of a variety
4
Spread wasn‚Äôt huge but were just nice that you will get to try a little bit of everything. However, the dessert spread left very little and were not quickly top up. I would come back again for dinner instead
5
A perfect place for gatherings, and affordable price for all! A nice place with good decorations and good spread of fresh and yummy food and desserts!
4
My husband and I have heard quite good reviews about your restaurant from friends. We decided to check it out ourselves. We were not disappointed. The staff was attentive and responsive to our needs. The quality of food was decent. The spread provided sufficient variety without being too lavish. Thank you.
5
Reasonably priced with high quality food and variety.
Most food were freshly prepared. Coffee was good.
Comfortable prayet rooms available with toilets , kiblat & prayer mat provided.
Service very attentive.
4
Loved the ambience of the restaurant. The staff were ever so eager to serve. The highlight of our dinner had always been the roast beef
4
Halal-certified buffet üëç
Food was awesome! üëç
Range of food not as much as as others.
Place is lively with good lighting...maybe not so suitable for cozy date nights...
But great experience overall...
5
All the food is very nice but hope to have more varieties. But overall very satisfied with the taste
3
Nice ambiance.
Affordable price.
Buffet spread for main course and cold dishes is quite limited but the desserts was nice.
3
Small selection but dishes are good. Not much local flavor though. Enough seats for large group gatherings
4
Venue - The place is family friendly and welcoming for a wide range of age group. The space in between tables are adequate but can be better positioned to ensure easy going in and out.Food - Caters to the taste buds of all generations. Can say this is a 3 generation restaurant because food serve caters the taste buds of children to the senior citizens.
3
Visited the place with colleagues for lunch buffet. Food was good but the spread is not so great. Very limited and practically nothing for vegetarians. Spread can be better
3
Have lunch on dec 22@this restro,food variety is not much,mostly local cuisine.But quality was good.except for the star of the show,the Christmas turkey,was a disaster,meat is dry & tough.It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a full house that day,mostly office personnel having lunch,& some table celebrating birthday,but the attendant was very attentive,to collect finish plate from my table.When paying the bill,the cashier even list out which credit card use are given a certain discount.Overall is a good experience
5
decided to bring wife to visit after she complain I am always eating good tasty food. so we had dinner date on Friday dinner. price is $47 ++. salmon was fresh. cakes are nice. prawns are deliciously good. only 1 thing I don't is the greedy diners taking full plates of crabs even though people are queuing up behind them. staff are responsive. however the crab counter is slow abit in topping up and there's is no q line. should separate the crab line away from sushi place. overall nice dining experience. got our money worth
4
Food was nice and staff was friendly and approachable. Staff gave us choices to sit where we wanted and gave us the comfortable location. Thanks a lot! Keep it up!
5
went here for dinner buffet. not much wide spread of food but overall, the staffs were very friendly and foods tasted nice! i really love the chocolate fondue!
4
Fast and efficient service by the crew. Plates were cleared fast. They were having their Christmas buffet when we were there. Enjoyed it tremendously. Good place for Muslims as the place is halal.
4
Went with the mind set of family bonding.
It turned out that the food on the line was very appetizing and indeed it was value for money.
Good !
4
I didn't get to get the Lobsters as the crowds rushed to snap up all. Anyway the spread of buffet Definitely worth it.
5
The spread is not as extensive as the other expensive buffets BUT it‚Äôs of a good quality. On weekdays, those over 50 years old get 50% off
4
Nice tasty food & ambience. Well served and great varieties of food. Local & international food. Staff response will quick. It was my Wife Birthday dinner and she was surprised with a birthday cake and song by staff.
5
It was an amazing experience for me to treat my family for dinner buffet on the 22nd December. The one who serves us were very efficient. Our table location was good and I love how they placed their napkins on the table before we sat. To do the reservation online was very convenient and they called one day before to confirm our booking. Excellent service. Thank you 21 on Rajah.
4
food spread was good however for the price range maybe more desserts and more side dishes could have been available. Moussaka was astounding. compliments to the chef there
4
visited 23 Dec 2017; extended family 7 adults & 2 young children (2 & 4yr olds)Adult $45/pax & children below 5 is free. Otherwise 5-12yr is $22.50/pax.*this might changeEntrance to restaurant is through the Days Hotel lobby at 1 Jalan Rajah. Though you can come in through the other side, reservation is at the hotel lobby side.We arrived at 6.50pm & promptly seated by 7pm. INTERIORThis is a Mediterranean-Asian Buffet Restaurant (street-market style). A truly refreshing coloured interior with matching furnitures, well-balanced space and not crammed. Good relaxing ambience to start your dinner.Table setup is matched to interior concept with high-quality napkins for guests. Good stuff. Iced water is free which will be replenished by a staff walking around.FOOD, DRINK & DESSERTI must say the spread selection is medium to full range. The area that food is served is a little tucked away. So from the seating area, the serving space looked small.But I find the food quality, style and presentation top notch. The freshness in all stations are well maintained including the lighting that plays their part. I am impressed with the details of each dish I tried. The herbs & spices used are generous which shows intense cooking styles. Loved the black pepper crayfish. Though most dishes are strong-tasting, this might not be a good palate for some.Fresh pastas & eggs need to be ordered/requested at the few counters within the serving space. I ordered aglio-olio pastas for my kids and preparation was fast.Sushi, roasted meat, roasted turkey, black pepper crayfish, fresh seafood, salad bar, fresh fruits, choc fondue, cookies & christmas delights, self-help cappuccino & coffee machines. I might miss something here, too much to list.Cold drinks. These are served in smaller glasses which is fine. If you find any of these drinks too sweet, simply dilute them with the iced water on your table. Flavours include Blueberry, Lychee & Bird Nest Tea.Desserts come in many types. Fresh fruits, berries & marshmallows with choc fondue. Chendol ice-cream with condiments. Cakes & mousses. Cheese platter & crackers. Or simply make your own coffee blends & tea. That, is a lot of selection.The floor staff is ever moving. Clearing your table, topping up iced water, managing new arrivals and at the same time managing guests' expectations face-on. Do have patience when you see them busy.The kitchen staff is always checking on food and replenishments. They ensure high food quality, presentation and availability at all times. Good to see them around.I'm happy with the overall experience and quality. Though it's hard to justify the $45/pax price tag, do consider the cleanliness, food quality, staff attentiveness & interior calmness. I personally think this restaurant scores in all areas.Thank you 21 On Rajah for making my family dinner an exciting one..
5
Had a great time with family during lunch buffet. The spread was good, although the live station could do with more selection. Desserts are varied and they make an effort to cater to all.
Will be back again for family gatherings.
3
I love the variety but it'd be great if there's more... however, with the awesome price ($30++) I was paying, this was a great bargain! Awesome :)
5
It was a perfect place for my family get together. The food is delicious and the staff is polite and helpful.
3
Not value for money. Food spread limited. For the price of 30++, it's better to eat at Sakura International that has better food spread. Or, dine at Royal Palm at Orchid Country Club, 1 for 1, at $40++. Informed restaurant that I'm celebrating 14th wedding anniversary but there's no special surprise. Not dining there again
5
Great ambience, good food, fantastic service from friendly staff especially Sankary! I will be back for more!
4
The food and ambience were great! Though they have less variety of food compared to other hotel buffets, they made it up with tasty food. Though the topping up of food should be faster rather than having guests having to tell the chefs.Still, i would come back for more
5
Buffet with a wide range of variety from many different asian cuisine such as western, japanese and mediterranean. Great environment and staff were very friendly and attentive. As it was my birthday also, not only the staffs drop by to present me a complimentary bdae cake they also present me with a birthday card with my family picture in it as a memento to bring back home. Thumb up 21 on Rajah. Would definitely recommend this place to all
3
When I first visited here, I thought there will be quite a range of menu. But when I reached there, then main course are quite disappointing for me. As I only love their tandoori chicken & noodles. The rest are not so appetising. Moving on desert for my personal favourite which is churros the restaurant might consider to have the original flavour & in small bites. Which will be easier for us as customers to munch on variety of food that offers. Thankyou.
5
We reached the restaurant @ 1.45pm and the staff told us that last serving @ 2.30pm. Saw the spread but was disappointed that the crayfish left gravy only so i scooped the bits of meat. Suddenly i assumed the supervisor said "i will get my chef to cook for you again". I smiled and walked-away. Told my husband at the table what happened, i asked him to see whether true or not they will cook the crayfish dish for me. To my surprise, my husband bring me back the crayfish dish. Thank you for making my day wonderful & stomach FULL
3
Ambience and service was pleasant. However, my friends and I were rather dissappointed with the buffet spread. At about $40+ per pax, the choices were limited.The food combination appeared incomplete too. Eg, Nasi Lemak - No egg/Fried Chix/Fish - There were chicken and fish dishes but didn't go well with the Nasi Lemak. No white rice option. There's seafood aglio olio and meatballs but no pasta to go along. The durian dessert was nice and so was the rasmalai. Cookies were too hard and the gelato was watery. Sushi dishes were ok.Overall, buffet experience was average but the spread could be more and better coordinated. Food choices not as many as advertised. May not re-visit
4
Very nice n cozy.. The food is delicious. They also can provide prayers room for the muslims. Overall we are very satisfied.
4
The most affordable buffet BUT one of the best that I've had. Worth all the money you spent if you're on a budget but need buffet for celebration for anniversary, work related or family
5
Had an enjoyable dinner experience at 21 on Rajah. Good spread and food was really tasty-delicious! Almost everything had seafood in it. Great variety of desserts and their cakes especially the Durian mousse, was the bomb! Restaurant ambience was really cozy and warm. Plus, staffs were friendly too! ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èFilled my tummy with happiness!
5
Had a dinner to commemorate my mother-in-law's birthday over at 21 On Rajah on the 8/10/17. We were greeted by Shermaine who showed us to our reserved seats(via Chope app). There's lots of variety of food and we did enjoy ourselves there. They also helped us keep our cake for the suprise birthday. Also during the billing, Shermaine helped us for a better deal. Thank you 21 On Rajah for making it a pleasant evening!
3
Came for lunch to catch up with friends @ 04/10/17. However, found the spread of food so dissapointing. My friends even commented that there is nothing much to eat
4
Service - Great service from the reception / cashier who advised the lowest payment option due to dual ongoing promotionFood variety and quality is good, especially the cake of the day which run out fast and I love the home-made gelato.
4
Good spread and quality food. Spacious seating area. Friendly, reliable and fast service from the staff .. always smiling. The whole ambience very uplifting - colourful and clean. Value for money ... better than some of the halal buffets in 5 star hotels in Singapore that display huge variety of food but terrible qualit
4
Its a nice quiet area. For the food, its roasted beef is always the best. not much cold dishes, but there's good mix of Asian and western foods on the buffet. I loved the dessert counter too, and their mini cheesecakes is a must to eat. Overall I'm always satisfied with the service with the waiter keepon topping up ur plain water cup
3
Ok spread. Better than some hotels, but not exactly fantastic when compared to buffets across all categories of hotels and restaurants. Location was hard to find for someone who does not live in Central North area of Singapore. The place is nicely lit and quite spacious
5
Great Service by by the crew members.Attentive to customer's needs.Great food!Nice ambience.A little inconvenient for those taking public transport
5
A great dining experience! A 15-20mins walk from MRT station Novena. Nice and clean environment where the staff was helpful and cleared those plates promptly. The food was good and our guys enjoyed the variety. Would look forward to visit it again
5
Wonderful staff who are friendly and attentive; cosy ambience yet clean and brightly lit , modest spread which is of good quality and certainly tasty. We love this restaurant for its generousity towards seniors who dine there. And the coffee is great too!
4
nice ambience.. great food options.. friendly staff... however can consider to add more mains in the buffet menu
4
Though food spread for dinner not that wide, the quality is great. Atmosphere is calm n relaxing for a sunday evening dinner. However, the ice cream not tht appealing in term of taste. Could have much better quality. Im rather particular about that ice cream taste.Will visit for lunch soon with bff n see on the diff menu.
3
It was suppose to be Mediterranean but there are no aspects of Mediterranean food like the yellow raisin rice. Maghribi chicken.Instead fried rice and beef ball were served.They took very long to topup to
4
Great place for good food in the company of family or friends.The selections are not wide but they are tasty. Popular dishes will be the sashimi station, crayfish in black pepper sauce and beef rib-eye.The main set back is that the buffet stations are at a corner of the restaurant. It is a squeeze to get certain dishes and you don't know where the queue is for what dish.I probably would be better if the fruit selections is increased. There are oranges but not cut. You gotta peel it yourself i guess.The chocolate fondue disappointed me mainly due to the taste or type of chocolate used.
5
Went to the restaurant for a small company gathering after work. The place was suitable for relaxed atmosphere. While the spread of food selection is limited as compared to other hotel buffets, the food was nice and tasty. We had several rounds of food. We stayed till 8pm and as Muslims, we required a place to perform our prayers and the restaurant obliged by giving us a small room on the upper floors to pray
4
I have been to the restaurant several times. Even though they don't have a large buffett spread which I thought minimise food wastage, what they laid out were sufficient and excellent, and not to mention affordable. The staff have always been helpful and attentive so kudos to that. All in all a good dining experience and it's becoming one of my go-to restaurants
4
The spread is not a lot, but the quality of food is reasonable. This is a Tuesday evening, so there's just a few tables.The plates were cleared the moment you finished the food. Water refilled promptly.Overall well worth the money, but its gonna be a 1 time event. :
5
The restaurant has a modern decor. It is bright and the furnishing compliments to the decor. The food spread is good and well spread out. Food is delicious and has a Mediterranean spread. Staff are courteous and service is good. Utensils are cleared once you leave the table for the next servings. The place is brightly lit. The food is certified Halal.
5
love the buffet spread! staff was very attentive! nice and clean ambience!perfect for birthdays, anniversary or company events!
5
i was here for a small family dinner. the food here is good. and the ambience is very comfortable and allowed us to really enjoy a good family dinner.
5
Love the meats - roast beef, lamb shank. The rest like salads and desserts are also great. Right combination of buffet spread. To TOP it off, we got 50% off our lunch for seniors 50 yrs old and above. That's really great!
4
Gone on a weekend for buffet lunch. Had a comfortable dinning experience there. The waiter who served us was friendly and helpful. Food ok, I like their little cakes and their salted egg lobster was yummy! Pioneers above 50 yrs old have 50% discount from Monday to Sunday and it is good place to bring your parents to dine at this restaurant.
4
The food was fantastic, i love the smoked duck with melon, it was my favourite, i kept eating that lol! The grilled meat is so juicy and tender too.Staffs are amazing, very helpful, from the receptionist, i think his name is Syamsul? It starts with S. Lol! Frm receptionist to the waiters, very friendly, and helpful.
4
The moment you step into the restaurant, you would be transported to the Mediterranean feel; the music, the decor and the food spread will take you there. Also a good mix of local cuisine too! Great lunch experience! Will definitely come back for dinner to try more seafood
4
Good ambience but would have been perfect if there had been a greater variety of buffet spread.....
4
Living nearby we decided to try this restaurant. The setting and the food are not really fancy, but the prawns were the best one i tried in any buffet, i could make my meal with only those and their wasabi mayo!My 4 years old son enjoyed the sushi and gulla melaca gelato very much.The staff was also friendly.I would recommend this place for a simple meal
5
I had an awesome experience at 21 on Rajah with it's great services and food. The staff are very friendly and they will take initiative in helping the customers. They even helped my family to take a Polaroid photo after I told them that it was my mother's birthday!
4
Everything is fine only the food served q late .. need to replenish fast on food at the tray & desserts too .. I love with the durians yummilicious but it's too little per glass :
5
Thought i expected more varieties. All the food tasted good with not one being a dissapointment. Service was great too!
4
Food varieties were little. other then that food was good. Nice and quiet environment. Concept is very nice. Went there for dinner buffet with my girlfriend, it was her birthday and they accepted my request and surprised her with slice of cakes. Overall good food.
5
It was me and my Husband's first time to have buffet dinner at 21 on Rajah and we thought the whole place was great! üòÅ
5
Nice ambience great staff good food. Recommended. Not so pack. Price is also reasonable. Will come again.
3
Nice buffet style restaurant at Zhongshan park. They serve good seafood, roast beef, salad, desert and soft drinks. But no alcohole..
5
Had a friends gathering for buffet dinner for a party of 10. Reservation was a breeze with the great assistance of Mr Henry Neng, Concierge Manager.Food was surprising fresh and piping hot. Variety may not be the most comprehensive but quality of food was undeniable good.Staffs were busy but never too busy to assist. Ms Irene, the restaurant Manager was seen everywhere, attending to guests, clearing tables and at the cashier. A nice touch by Ms Irene was when she asked about the dining experience we had and the food served during payment. Restaurant is also a Halal certified restaurant so Muslims TA readers can add this restaurant to their list of to go to eat venue.Worth every cent paid
3
Went with my family for lunch buffet to celebrate my mum's bdae. Since i had made prior reservation to cater baby chair and a space for the stroller, all were well arranged for. Buffet spread was not much of a variety and unfortunately more of beef dishes which we do not consume. A great gesture from the Manager who got the chef to prepare lamb especially for us. An excellent service rendered by staff Ms Lily.
5
It has a good large spread but would love to see some more Indian breakfast options like Dosa, Sandwich et
4
Great and helpful staff who have helped to ensure that the venue was well-prepared for my company cohesion of 69 pax. Favourable food, although some of the favourites (waffles, churros, sushi, etc) needed extra time to be prepared. However, the restaurant was not crowded and we could take our food with much ease. Would have loved to have an enclosed area instead (that was our understanding) so as to not disturb the other patrons. We had to speed up our programme as it was time for the Muslims to break their fast. It was quite a rush on our end and was really disrupting the others but otherwise, everything went well. However, thank you to Lily and GX for arranging everything. GX was very kind to accommodate to our needs and even assisted us in packing the company cake in a few small takeaway boxes. Really appreciate it
5
We had our iftar here and this was our 2nd time. The food spread was good for the price we paid for. The durian mousse was to die for.
4
For this price, the food is good. The variety is just right. We didnt over eat. The cold dish, crab and prawn is very fresh. I hv so many, i think my cholestrol jjust went hey wire. Just a little hiccup went we arrived. Our reservation was 6pm but the food was not ready untill 6.20pm. We had to wait outside the restaurant for 35 mins as we arrive early.
4
Food was awesome and delicious. Superb food.Mixed of malay food, japanese food, chinese food and western food.Dessert was awesome. Dessert spread was delicious. Durian was seperb!My second visit to 21 on Rajah! Variety spread of food with the price are affordable!Recommended to all!Nice place to chill and relax especially for couples and friends.Will come back again for the buffet
5
Stayed at hotel right above for about a week. Had daily breakfast at 21. Meal was great and plenty to choose from. Services was friendly especially Lily who went out of her way to help my two kids. Place was clean. Will definitely come back
4
The quality and selection of food for the buffet lunch was good. Some of our guests who were first-time visitors to the restaurant also expressed their interest in going back again. Other perks we enjoyed included the promotional pricing for senior citizens and free parking over lunchtime.Lily and Agnes responded to emails very promptly which facilitated the planning of the lunch, and Lily was also very accommodating of our last-minute requests
3
Been there a few times for company gathering. We have quite a few Muslim staff and always nice to be able to eat together without diet restriction. The spread was not great but just about adequate. Fairly quiet for a large dining room. Free parking for the first couple of hours was helpful
5
Further to my earlier review on 2nd May, we were back at the restaurant for our Iftar. It was very enjoyable, relaxing and no rush in getting your food. The spread was quite a selection for all to enjoy. The dishes were replenished when it was low. The staff was very attentive and empty plates cleared immediately. Well hope to be back again soon. Ps do make reservation if you intend to dine here.
4
The buffet spread was good with loads of variety of food but the only setback is that their refills were very slow. But overall was good.
5
This is our second stay at Days and we really enjoy the Breakfast at the restaurant. Lily and the staff are so welcoming and friendly.The buffet has something for all. Will be back agai
4
The food was yummy and tasty. However the bread was too hard and the icecream was also too hard to be eaten. Otherwise, pretty good and the cost was not super expensiv
5
Selection of food is not wide, but standard of food is high. I am particularly impressed with the service standard of the staff members. They were polite and went the extra mile to cater to the needs of my guests. Restaurant ambience is great and location is easily accessible.
5
Good place to bring your family or friend for lunch or dinner.The food so good and alot.I will go again with my family this time.
4
The assortment of food was awesome. We enjoyed the food tremendously. Looking forward to dine there again.
2
We paid for BBQDinner but we did not find the BBQ food section. If there were the staff also did not promote the section.
5
Good n fresh food. Good range of food. Good n attentive service. Good atmosphere. We truly enjoyed the afternoon.
3
I liked the scenery, ambience and layout of the restaurant. Service was great and staff were efficient and polite throughout. The only setback is the spread of food. It wasn't much. I wish there was plenty more variety (esp the ice cream)! I felt disappointed as I had paid for approx $57 per pax for a weekend lunch with my family. But the price wasn't on par with the food. Delicious..just not worth the money
3
Good ambience... food spread was limited but replenishment was done regularly.Buffet spread area narrow. Service was good. Not really value for money.
5
Great variety of food to fill your belly up for the day! Having a food intolerance issues ( I have many food items I can't eat ) it's not easy to eat outside home and a specially when traveling in different country. However on a first morning coming to breakfast I was bit cautious to see what can I have...but I didn't need to worry that for long at all! There was a lot to choose...fruits...oat porridge ...eggs...and more. I was relaxed and happy girl! The staff worked hard and was very helpful, caring for our needs. We enjoyed our breakfast every morning. Thank you
3
The seafood section was a little disappointing with no sashimi. The crab legs were few and not appertising. The rest of the mediterranean spread was alright. As it was my second visit, I was pleasantly surprised to learn of the discount for seniors. Service was prompt and courteous.
4
This is my second visit to 21 on Rajah. The staff are polite and efficient - our plates are cleared promptly and staff asked if they could clear if they are unsure. The food is very fresh and varied. The cold prawns are very fresh while the mussels are on the tiny side but fresh too. The salads, dressing are crunchy, fresh and delicious. The cooked variety includes lamb shank, flower crabs, chicken and fish, all of which are delicious and I like them because most are spicy. The beef is super and the variety of sauces made it more exciting. I would visit again for sure. If they can have sashimi during lunch it would be much better.
5
The staff at 21 on Rajah have been nothing but courteous and helping each morning we have enjoyed our breakfast. Food has been of the cleanest, safest options available, nothing is of concern. Happy to recommend
5
Breakfast was very good. Service and staff were commendable. Definitely go again. It's clean with a modern feel.
4
Limited variety of food but for that price is fine. Food taste is wonderful. Recommended for family outings and no frill buffet
5
The place was nicer than expected.Ambience is a 5/5,And the customers that were dining with us, though many, the noise level was tolerable.Food is great, and the dishes were replenished very frequently to ensure freshness
4
Food was delicious. Not much spread but the quality of food is commendable. There was a mix of traditional (cheng teng, kuihlapis, etc) and western desserts (churros, cheesecake, mousse, etc). Perfect for the old and young
5
Food spread was delicious! Great service. Had a really good time. Definitely coming back for more! Thank you!
3
Bright and nice restaurant and it's a "halal" but the selection on food is quite limited on weekdays. Better and wider selection on weekends. For the coming Ramadan month "sahur" available for hotel guest, breaking of fast as per normal buffet dinner. Worth a visit if around Balestier Road or TTSHospital. Good service from all your staff, Syhami , Agnes and Irene.
5
Food selection is fine, typically what you expect from a hotel for continental hot/cold breakfast, ambience of the restaurant is bright, clean and to top it off, Lily who is the floor supervisor/team lead/restaurant manage is exceptional!She is exceptionally friendly even in a peak busy influx of tourist groups entering the restaurant for breakfast.Lily is very hospitable and just makes your day
4
We booked the entire restaurant for our baby shower so that part of the restaurant can be sectioned off for set up of a bouncy castle and some activities for the kids. The staff Lily has been most helpful in helping us to get the necessary approval and liasoning. Food spread is reasonable and palatable and but tend to be on the spicy side even the noodles which in the menu selection, it is not stated that chilli will be added. Thus limited choice for the kids to eat. Guests do feedback that the curry crayfish, beef and ondeh ondeh were good.Another thing to note that as it is a halal restaurant, every external food brought in has to be halal, even the customary gift box of cakes to be brought home by guest. Thus if you are intending to hold an event there, do note.A big THANK YOU to Lily and team for making our event a smooth and pleasant one
1
I actually called up to check if there is a cake . And the guy who assist me saying that he will put up a note and the cake is a complimentary from them. When i came, nothing was serve . I felt disappointed and if i knew this would happen i had bring my own cake 
5
My family and I had an enjoyable dining experience at 21 on Rajah. Not only did the food taste delicious, but they were also kept well-stocked. Staff that night were also highly attentive and friendly. Kudos to them! We will definitely be back again.
4
I reserved a table for 6 but I realised there's no need on a Thursday night as it wasn't packed to the rafters. Rather it was quiet (we reached by 8). Food wise I'm not sure if I came too late cos the cheese platter had very little cheese slices left. The roast beef and rice were nice. I like how they cater to vegetarians (take a look at their menu!). The dessert bar was fine - can't go wrong with choc fondue and gelato. Would visit again if they'd stock up on their food better. I heard the bread pudding's good but it wasn't available at that time.
3
There are not many hotels that cater halal buffets where we have friends of all races can gather together for a good meal. This cafe though the buffet spread is not big but still it's quite a worthy value for money treat. The only setback is that almost 95% of the main course are all spicy stuff which may not suit those who can't take spicy food instead
4
I went there with a group of friends. The booking is easy and the staff are friendly. The buffet spread is variety and good quality food and ingredients. The environment is nice and modern
2
Expected much better.Spread was very limited for even a 3star buffet. Desserts only 3 confectionary items with a few kuehs. Limited dishes. Some good. Some average. Some below average.The ambience was nice but that was it. The cooks were not welcoming and seemd as if it was such a chore to work there.Service staff were attentive though.Rated poor mainly due to the food variety against what is pai

A lovely place for dining. Good Quality Food, but the choices of Dishes are rather few. At least need to add 5 or 6 main courses. Desserts are also good, but again lack in variety
5
Great delicious food with a large variety. Also offered nice halal food. The major plus is the high quality cheese assortment and tasty desserts
3
The buffet spread kind of getting lesser.. I used to love the roast beef but unfortunately my last visit was a disappointment.
4
This was the second time my family and I came to 21 On Rajah. We previously came during dinner time. This time round, we came for brunch, thinking they might have a different selection. Unfortunately, everything was the same as when we came the first time.Though the same, the quality was still good. Food was replenished promptly and it catered to different tastebuds, for the lack of a better term. It's a great place for both small and big gatherings and is rather reasonably priced. On top of that, it's HALAL!Not too sure if the selection changes based on the day but both times were the same. If it is same no matter what day, going once is enough, unless you really LOVE the food that is
2
For the price the variety and number of dishes were shockingly few. The quality of food was alright but finished dishes were not replaced quickly. Not much thought went into the planning of the menu
4
Overall a very pleasant dining experience as the food quality was very good although limited variety. I personally prefer quality over quantity. The seafood on ice and sashimi was very fresh. Staff was quick to return your used plates. Very spacious and comfortable as well. Good gathering place for large groups
4
Nice environment for birthday celebration dinner with family. Very calm atmosphere. Good customer service.
5
Good quality food. Good taste. Variety was okay but quality is quite good. Price is not so expensive. Good value for money halal buffet.
4
The visit was welcomed by the friendly staff and enjoyed the lovely ambience. There were an array of excellent choice of food spread. This had been our 4th visit to 21 on Rajah. I'm sure will be back for more.
5
A small selection of dishes at the buffet but of a very high standard. Each flavoursome and well displayed.
5
My first time at 21 on Rajah and I am happy with the service and lunch spread. Staff was friendly and ready to help when needed. For the buffet spread, the chicken lasagna and waffles was our favorite.
5
I came together with my family and everyone love the food Here. Worth the money and I will definitely come here again. Perfect atmosphere for family event, wedding and dating.
5
I came to celebrate my eldest 14th birthdae n bring along my whole family to enjoy e finest dining. We enjoyed e food especially e birthday girl. Overall, excellent.
3
Been there a few times and my friend as well on her own many times. While staff service was friendly, the buffet selection was not great. Very limited choices, and not replenished or very slow in top up. My Muslim friend was disppointed when there was no laksa or curry available. Dessert spread was not very appealing either. It's not value for 40 SGD buffet as such and I would not mind paying more to get better quality & selections
5
came here for 1st time for our wedding annivasary and had a great time..atmosphere was nice, staff was helpful and friendly, food was delicious
1
not much range to choose from, food wasnt fresh. dessert looks cheap. the seafood looks like it's been there sitting for a long time. not worth your time and money. rather be in sakura
5
Quality good food and kind services from the staffs! I love it! Will bring my family over next week!
4
it would be have been better if there was more varieties of food.
Price was reasonable.
Food was fresh.
Was a good experience
4
This is definitely the restaurant to visit especially in a large group. This place has got nice ambience and really quality food
4
Would like to comment on lily and Nan for their excellent service and polite attitude. Helping us to make our company event a smooth one.The food were good. Especially the mushroom soup which was yummy. Its not easy to find a halal buffet restaurant that is affordable and spacious. Thus, will definitely be back.
2
Not Rijjstafel as advertised. Except for lamb & spicy chicken, food quality was poor. Tea was cold with single selection of English breakfast. Staff was friendly & helpful but unfortunately, we will not return because of the poor food quality.
4
..for a good variety of fresh and tasty food as well as for providing a very friendly service and creating a cozy atmosphere. Especially thanks to you, Lily
4
Celebrated my mum's 64th on 5 march. This is our 3 visit there. Good food, nice ambience. Lily remembered us. She is so nice and friendly. Thks u for the great service lil
5
We had our wedding dinner at 21 on Rajah for about 200 people. Everything went well, from the day we made decisions to held our wedding there till the very day itself. Nan, who we have been liaising with before the wedding is such an understanding person. She took note on my small little request and is so caring. We are thankful to meet someone like her.Despite Nan being pregnant, she still came before our wedding to help prepare with the decorations and other things. Dear Nan, thank you for everything. We'll remember it. Food was fantastic. Guests that came, cannot stop talking about the food. The comments we received were "this place is so chill" "food was fantastic". They kept on talking for days. Thank you Einstein and the service team for the excellent service. Everybody came, enjoyed and went home smiling. Priceless. PS: now i'll be looking forward to those whose wedding will be at 21 on rajah ;)
4
My family went there to celebrate my brother's birthday. We requested a small cake and they decorated it really nicely. The food was good. There were steak, lobsters, rojak, salads, churros and many many more i didnt get a chance to eat all of them. Recommended everyone should give it a try!
4
A cozy restaurant that provides a good variety of food. The food is fresh and is tasty. Service is prompt and the staff is friendly and polite. Overall, an enjoyable experience
3
Wide range of food to choose from. Its recommended for group functions. Although it gets loud at times due to crowd, but we enjoyed the food nonetheless.
5
Lovely spread of food with friendly staff. Everyone who visits should try the durian mousse. It's the bomb!
2
Food variety was extremely little. Space to take food was too small and easily crammed. Desserts was so-so. Nothing fantastic
5
We would like to thank Nan, Lily and the team for making our annual celebration at your restaurant a success. A special menu was customised to our requirements and budget. The ambience for the restaurant is very pleasant, food is delicious and the staffs are very friendly. Lily also provided advice based on her experience in managing the queue. Thank you once again for the pleasing dining experience.NanLilyEnsfineAgnesAmandaSyamiCarrieand all the chef
4
We arrived later than the usual crowd and found that certain dessert were finished and that the restaurant had nothing to replace with. If we are paying for the normal buffet price, why are we shortchanged? Please ensure that you have enough to replenish for guests that comes any time instead of suggesting that guests should rush and hoard food. Thank you
5
Good quality of food and choices, service was excellent, however replenishment of the buffet line was slow, can be improve. Will definitely recommend to friends/relatives
5
Food is good & staff is friendly. Good place to mingle with friends & family. 21 on Rajah is Muslim friendly. Prayer's is available. Very convenient.
4
Bright and cheerful environment with reasonably good food. The roast beef was really good, and the cold prawns and crab were very fresh. Churros and durian mousse were great. I don't eat sashimi, but i noticed that the salmon sashimi were in good size thickness and very very popular.Attentive service from staff ensured our plates were cleared promptly and our water glasses never emptied.Perhaps the selection of hot drinks could be improved. There was either English Breakfast tea, expresso, or regular coffee. A bit of a letdown after a good dinner
5
Celebrate my husband's birthday at 21 On Rajah. Overall experience was great and thank you for the Birthday Cake :) Good food but it will be great if there's more option of food.
4
Really good for large groups! The staff are also really patient and friendly. The quality of food (especially deserts) was great, and the spread, despite not being VERY large, was satisfactory.
4
Looking for a halal buffet? This one has a good spread and it's definitely got some great choices too. The food was fresh and I liked that they had a variety i.e. from Mediterranean to Asian. The deserts were good too.
4
The restaurant has varieties of good food, cosy ambient and excellent service staff. Surely, we will recommend to others to try.
5
We were provided a room to do our prayers and were treated very warmly. The food was yummy and ambience was great. Thank you!
5
Comfortable ambience for family gatherings,events etc. The quality of food is fresh although the variety is limited bt overall was delish..Staff were friendly and approachable. There's a place for muslim guests to perform their prayers located at lvl 3(ladies) and lvl 4(gentlemen.)
5
I sometimes have my lunch at 21 on Raja and today the lunch was as usual as good as the service provider. It's always a pleasure to meet lily who provided excellent service. Her attentiveness and smile made the lunch more enjoyable. Thank you lil
3
We arrived at around 7.30pm and the seafood cold station was almost gone. What left there were salmon and clam. We were quite disappointed because there was any replenishment made.
5
we enjoyed the delectable food served on 15 Jan 2017.Though the variety was not as much as other buffets we've been to, I choose quality over quantity. From the fresh seafood right up to desserts, I found nothing that I do not like! I guess 21OnRajah will have to see us more often :
3
The taste of the food is good for buffet. Only lacks variety for the price. Overall its ok to dine here. Went on a weekday dinner service.Staffs are friendly. :
5
We had our company department dinner here last week and have nothing but great feedback on the food and service!Nan, the restaurant manager, was really helpful and accommodating in meeting our needs throughout the planning of the dinner. We booked the private room located at the back of the dining hall. The staffs, Syahmi and Agnes (just to mentioned a few) were also helpful in ensuring that everything ran smoothly.The quality and spread of food was superb as ever! From salmon sashimi to roasted lamb and to a gelato dispensing machine, we had a very good dining experience indeed.Reasonably priced, coupled with fantastic quality of food, service and also a cosy ambience setting, I would definitely recommend 21 on Rajah to everybody.Thank you, Nan and the team, for making our dining experience a very welcoming and enjoyable one! (I do apologize for the noise during the course of dinner on that particular night. We hope we did not cause much inconvenience to the staffs and public.
5
We held a lunch buffet wedding function for 500 guests on 12/11/16. Decor: A little disappointed that we paid so much for the decor from the decor vendor but the decorations was mixed with the christmas decoration by the hotel. Otherwise, everything else was in place and tastefully decorated.Food: Most of our guests mentioned the tasty food from the buffet, large spread and the servings were topped up whenever appropriate.Staffs: The countless times we were there for food tasting, site recce and meetings for discussions - the wait staffs have always been attentive to the guests. Very pleasant, friendly and approachable.Management: We had the pleasure of having Ms Nan and Enstine handle our wedding. Great to work with and very patient. Amidst the many changes and complications that happened throughout the planning phase, they worked well with us.Venue: Easy to find and centrally located. Hotel provided free parking for the first 2 hours and anything beyond that, the carpark coupon is given out for free to our guests
4
We had a reunion of primary schoolmates... the food was awesome.. will come again with my husband and children...
4
This is my 4th or 5th visit to 21 on Rajah and I am still pleased as before with their food selection, service and ambience!
5
The first time when i was with my boyfriend. He took me to have a late dinner around 8pm, so not many people came. First thing I sensed, the staffs are so nice. They always smile to you and it makes me happy. This restaurant has Mediterranean-style-foods. You always can find seafood in here. But you can also find the other things such as sushi, roasted beef and chicken also cute cakes (their cheese cake is so nice *o*) and if you're mosleem, no need to be worry. All of their foods are Halal :)Definitely would going back
4
The atmosphere is quite normal not magnificently done, food is great really love the roasted lamb leg they have, there are very friendly people working there, one of the boy named qris even took a step further and brought a clean plate for me and the girls there smile very much would always return to this place for a good meal with my famil
4
Great variety of food couple with great quality cooking. I especially liked the durian in small containers, the turkey and its sauce, the roasted beef as well as the gelato. One suggestion is for the crabs to be in sweet sour sauce. Staff is very attentive and courteous. Overall great dining experience for the Xmas holiday. I am recommending my friends to come for the CNY break.
5
My (now) husband and I held our solemnisation at the restaurant in December and I have to say that our guests gave great feedback about the food and service. From the initial planning stage all the way to the event day, the restaurant manager, Nan was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was accommodating to our needs and helped us with the planning process. The staff were also wonderful and welcoming, attending to our needs close to the day of the event. In particular, Enstein has to be commended for his friendliness and the help he rendered us. Of course, the quality of the food was superb, and our guests were impressed by the variety as well as the amount of food available. In total we had close to 200 guests, and they were kept happy and full during the entire lunch. Overall, I would recommend this place if you are thinking of holding an event, as the staff are professional, food is good and almost everything was provided for.
5
Wonderful Experience, nice decor, helpful & friendly staffs, good & tasty spread of food. Read good reviews on the restaurant and had to experience it myself and I was not disappointed one bit.
4
Although the variety seems limited as compared to other prominent hotel buffets, the dining area is spacious, my cup is always refilled (cold water), attentive service staff and though not accessible by public transport, I find this to be a contributing factor to its quiet location as I managed to dine in peace. Most importantly, food was delicious!I could have easily given a full rating but my favourite salmon sashimi was absent and sushi variety was too limited. They had a soft serve gelato dispensing machine which was OK... Better than scooping difficult frozen ice cream at some places.Price wise, could have been cheaper but I guess the ambience and dining experience was considered better than other places. The dining table was of solid built, though. Chair, too.21 On Rajah, please consider increasing your variety and you will be perfect
4
1. Service was great.2. Food and quality of food was great.3. The best is the hotel have a prayer room for muslim4. Only fruit drinks should be maximise and make variety.Overall.was great!
3
Not much variation on food but the staff were friendly and cleared all the cutleries the moment we finish with our food. It'll be nice if they could more varieties on food.
4
Whilst the buffet spread was not plentiful, food quality was satisfactory! Seafood (sashimi, prawns etc) were fresh and the durian mousse was very nice!
Nice place for hanging out with friends!
4
Delicious & well-cooked foods but not much varieties. Overall, the price is worth for a nice and relax dinner.
5
We had a girlie getogether on Dec 20 to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was a perfect venue with good food and excellent service. Senior discount was also an added draw!
3
Nice beef! Juicy and tender!Good service. Nice ambience.Great for birthday celebrations, anniversaries etc.Downside was that the seafood and sushi choices were limited
1
Is my boyfriend birthday, was to suprise him w good food but then the food is too cold and less choices
5
The buffet is always superb, and the staff super helpful, efficient and initatiated to care for senior citizen
4
Lamb and Shepard's Pie were delicious. The prawns were fresh and juicy. We enjoyed most of the food there except for the chicken as we found the smell of the spices too strong on that day but will definitely come again
5
We had two gatherings with noisy friends at this restaurant on the 8th & 13th Dec....we really had fun with the first group that we decided to come back with another group. It's interesting that we had different buffet lunch on these two occasions. Glad that it wasn't repeated. Food is yummy and I'd say the spread was fine. And the pricing is perfect for us retirees The staff was friendly, attentive and smiling. Despite us being noisy ( we are happy people)...a special shout out to Lily who was extremely helpful and cheerful. We'll be back again coz we ‚ù§Ô∏è the ambience, food, pricing and the friendly staff
5
I love the ambiance and the food spread. Staff are always warmth and friendly. A definite venue for family's continuous bonding time
5
Our Principal Ms Yoong has given the non-teaching staff & service providers a Lunch treat at 21 on Rajah this afternoon (12 Dec 2016). We are extremely impressed by the good services provided by the serving staff. They are not only warm and friendly, greeted us with smiles. They are also prompt in following up to all our last minute requests. Ms Lily has been very resourceful and helpful to provide us with cakes for the birthday celebration for our 2 colleagues. She is also quick to provide solution to a colleague who observe vegan diet. All such requests are with no additional charge. It is indeed a good dining place for bonding with staff.All our staff give a thumbs up to the food (fresh prawns, flower crabs and yummy beef) and great cheery ambience - a great place to go
4
This is my first time hoing as my mum birthday. The food nice and i salute the worker keep the food fill.
5
We had a night in Singapore between a cruise and flying home so stayed at Days Hotel having an excellent breakfast in 21 on Rajah. Plenty of food and plenty of choice, a really great start to the day.
4
affordable business lunch at a relatively new hotel. conveniently located near major two expressways.
4
Breakfast at 21 On Rajah was fastastic. Even though the spread wasn't exhausting, the food served really delighted my taste buds. Even a simple dish like scrambled eggs was beautifully done and delicious, what more can I say about the other foods!
5
The food were delicious although there weren't a variety. It was just nice to keep you really full. The seafood were basic and not much but totally worth your $$. The place was just amazing and so nice! A good place to celebrate a birthday/occasion
3
Food was not bad, but nothing outstanding. With a dining space like what they have, they should have prepared a more extensive range of cuisines and food options. And some of the food displays don't seem enticing
3
Tried their breakfast buffet during our last day stay at the hotel. It shows in agoda that breakfast buffet is at 17sgd. I was a bit surprised that it costs S$21++. In fairness, the food was great! I was expecting noodles (like prawn mee or minced meat)
4
Food was good but some good took awhile to be topped up or never topped up at all. Ambiance was ok. The place was clean and staff were attentive to customers need
4
The food is good but not much variety. The portion is sufficient. I found that there are biasness seen at the restaurant especially on particular customers Birthday. In my opinion, this should not occur otherwise the service is excellent
5
The buffet spread was delicious... My favourite would be the Salted Caramel Ice Cream.... However lack of asian food..
4
Although the location was alittle out of the way (not very near a MRT), the food offered in this halal buffet was excellent. Although the spread was not as expansive as we thought, it was pretty substantial and for the price definitely value for money
4
The spread wasn't big, but the selection was varied and quite tasty. We were promptly showed to our tables and informed when the buffet started. Overall a pleasant experience. Dishes I enjoyed: fresh prawns, laksa, rib roast.
4
Widespread of food, prompt topping up of food, promptly cleared our used plates, ambience clean and appropriate for family get together.
5
(1) Great ambience
(2) Variety of food for the price paid for
(3) Good service
(4) Ease of booking reservation
4
We celebrated our mum's birthday. The staff were very helpful in making it a surprise birthday celebration for her :
5
The selection at the restaurant is good! Although not as wide as some other buffets in the market, all the food was thoroughly enjoyable from the cold down to the hot section. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed the seafood - particularly the succulent crab legs! Also, there was a live cooking station serving up laksa that was done really well. The gravy is better than most that one can find anywhere in SG.Overall it was an enjoyable experience and I will gladly pay the restaurant another visit some day
5
We recently held our wedding reception at 21 On Rajah and were blown away by the overall experience. The venue itself was exactly what we were looking for - good food, impeccable service, and cosy atmosphere for an intimate reception (150pax). As a wedding venue we couldn't fault anything. The food was out of this world and all our guests commented on the quality of food on offer. The butter rice, durian mousse, chilli slipper lobster, and many more were amazing! We received so many compliments about the food eventhough it was not the traditional kind of food usually served in a malay wedding.The buffet spread played a huge part in the success of our event and the amount of our guests who are still talking about your food is testament to that. It was a pity that my husband and I were not able to enjoy the food as much as we wished to but that only means that we will be back down for another round of buffet soon!Nan, John, and the rest of the staff were nothing but helpful in the run-up and the event day itself; we couldn't praise them enough. We liaised mainly with Nan who was very accommodating and professional. Given her vast experience in handling events, she gave us recommendations whenever we were in need of opinions eg seating plan, table setting, and etc. She was also very helpful in liaising with our accommodation at Ramada. We were delighted with the arrangements and couldn't thank Nan enough for the complimentary breakfast and poster. We were also pleased with John who provided impeccable service during our food tasting and event itself.  Compliments to Nan, John, the chefs, and their team involved for making our reception a memorable one! Also to the staff of Ramada Hotel, for making our stay an enjoyable one! :
3
Food is ok but variety is too less, need to improve on the variety. Soup only one choice, rice and noodle and vegetable is very less, not much variety as well. Drinks are also limited
5
Everybody enjoyed the meal for the restaurant have good selection of Halal foods presented beautifully and the tastes are excellent. The staff were very courteous and very helpful. We had 2 lunches and 3 dinners in our 5-day stay in Singapore for the children really likes the place for the food and ambiance and the exceptionally good staff
4
We enjoyed the breakfast buffet this morning Lots of variety Loved the omelette Delicious and cooked perfectly Fruit was fresh and delicious Staff attentive Especially LillyShe made us feel welcome and accommodated our special request with a smile Yesterday she offered us options due to our very late arrival to breakfast Thanks for taking care of us!
5
No regrets getting there having buffet dinner again.I will definitely reccomend this to my friend.
Last not least it is good to have a nice staff over there
1
The food quality has drop during the weekday. Previously, even though the quantity is average, the quality is excellent. Now the quality is not there. Some food and dessert lole the bubur pulut hitam was tasteless and the meat loaf was not cook properly.
4
The buffet spread was decent for the price of 30++. Might not be as comprehensive as bigger buffets, but there were some variety that i felt justified the price. Not for the fussy buffet eaters though. Mains were good, but the desserts were so-so. I especially liked the salmon (which i assume is the special), it was really well done! some things to note - Free parking for first 2 hours at the hotel, use chope vouchers for 10% off, get 50% off if you're over 50
3
Friendly waiters. Food is tasty. However location is not very accessible via public transport. Would appreciate if the people at the welcome/payment counter can greet and; they need to smile more. :
5
Held my company event at the hotel and the staff were really helpful, everything was settled and up to expectation. Overall, very well done. Special shootout to Lily, the restaurant captain and Nan the restaurant manager for the hospitality
4
Variety choices of breakfast, staff is friendly, helpful. Halal kitchen. Clean, bright. Value for money
5
The customer services even though short handed, they will attend to u with a smile, and they will try to accommodate to ur need
5
Very friendly environment. Helpful staffs. Good variety of food. Good venue for family gathering while enjoy good range of food.
4
Good selection of food for the price, good ambience and good place to have gatherings. Good social space
5
the spread was great for the price that we paid. Went on a weeknight to celebrate the boyfriend's birthday, and it seemed like every table there had a birthday celebrant. Service was superb, food was fresh, and ambiance was really good. Will definitely go back again
5
An excellent choice for a get together with colleagues over a good spread of lunch, yet, with an attractive and affordable price
5
If u r looking for a place to treat ur family and dont want to spend much, this is a decent place to come. Lovely spread, impeccable service in a hotel ambience.
2
I cannot say I got my money's worth considering the price (expensive) and not much food choices. Seems plenty to offer in the website but totally different in reality. Not coming back anymore
5
Went to this place for the lunch in earl Sept 2016, having a la carte but yesterday (06/10/2016) went with family during dinner. Some having buffet and some having a la carte...only now I'll able to give my sincere comment.Congratulations all staff at raja21, you always made our dining experience a pleasant one. Ur warm services with the generous smile made us feel like home. For sgd40 dinner buffet, the food was decently displayed with variety choices and the taste is up to standard. The chef will assist u if u need any help on the food eg..steak need to be done medium to well done. Thank you everyone at raja21 for the great service. Will definitely come again
5
Awesome service with all the great hospitality, thank you for the last minute birthday request . Appreciate the staff involved Miss Lily and crew. Thumbs up from start till end
4
Great and full Fun & laughter. Buffet spread is awesome. We also managed to have our Afternoon Prayer is one Private Room provided by the Hotel. Very helpful Staff who did the clearance of Plates without delay and very friendly . Couldn"t recalled their name but 1 chinese ( Name Start with "J" ) & 1 malay staff ( Name Start with "S"). Excellent service Render.
2
Food variety was very poor, and the quality was atrocious. It was supposed to be a "Mediterr-asian" buffet, a fusion of Mediterranean and Asian food. Yet there was only one carving station and about eight other variety of main dishes that were neither Asian nor Mediterranean. They were a hodgepot of whatever ingredients the chef probably had in the fridge that day. One apparently signature "prawn noodles" was so shockingly horrid (I mean, how bad could prawn noodles get? But this dish deserves a gold medal for worst prawn noodles ever) we all took a bite and did not eat it thereafter. The two points given were because of the great service from the staff, if not this restaurant deserves a big fat zero for food. Will NEVER return again. It was an utter waste of my $40++ per person
3
The ambience and staff were excellent. The food and dessert spread could be improved further to make the meal value for money. What was lacking were the absence of essential cutlery like desert spoon/fork and Western/Chinese soup spoons for Asian dishes eg laksa. Diners are only given a spoon, fork and knife and these are to be used for everything - soups, dishes, dessert and fruits. For a hotel restaurant, the proper range of cutlery should be made available.
4
21 on Rajah is conveniently located. The ambience, service and food are very good. It is a great place for a relaxing meal with the family.
4
Food was excellent. Cold seafood variety was limited. Quite frequently went there however service is not really attentive.
5
Great variety of fresh foods, very hygienically clean and help full staff that are more than welcoming to give advice on there range and choices of foods to try. Amazing choice and excellent service.
4
There is a wide selection available for the buffet. We were celebrating my mothers birthday that day. And she received a free birthday cake. Pleasant restaurant staff, who are friendly.
5
awesome food! esp love the desserts! so much variety i wished i have more time to eat! first trip but will definitely come back to try the ala carte!
5
We were very pleased with the value lunch and benefits the restaurant provided for senior citizens. Food was good and value for money and staff very friendly and customer focus!
5
Service is good. Food spread is also good and delicious too. My personal fav is the mushroom soup. The kebab and rojak are delicious too. In fact, we love eating here. Prayer rooms are available too upon request at the counter. Will definitely recommend to others
5
First time dinning here, cozy restaurant and the service staffs are quick and efficient. Special thanks to the Captain, Mr. John, for being hospitable and welcoming.I especially like the Lotus Chicken Corn soup, simple and just like the way how my mum brew it. Limited variety of choice but the spread was uniquely delicious
5
It was our first time there. We love the buffets. But we could be happier if the staffs are more friendlier
5
The staff were friendly n understanding with seniors. Food choice was excellant. Will return again. Keep up the service execellanc
3
Went for lunch and food was nice but it would be really nice to have more variety as i think the variety of food was too little and there's only one type of iced flavoured drink. I should say the Laksa was very good, overall was still ok
5
Had a birthday party today . Booked the whole place to ourselves. Guests all complimented that the d√©cor good, service is excellent and the food was great.Restaurant manager Nan was very good and requested to meet up prior to party. That showed how dedicated they are in providing good service.Will highly recommend to everyone who wants to have a good time
5
Ambience is nice. Good services. Everything booked and perfectly well doned as planned. Awesome birthday cake and the price is reasonable! Shall visit again!
5
Had a dinner cum birthday celebration. Fantastic food that comes with complimentary cake for the birthday boy as well üôÇ
4
Had a corporate dinner for my staff and everyone enjoyed it well. Great Ambience. Great service. Great food. Great location. Could do with more variety on the hot food. However, it's value for money.
4
The ambience was really relaxing and the staff were friendly. The food tasted great but there were not much variet
2
There were flies at our tables. There was not much variety. Laksa was too salty and gravy was thin. 3 types of cakes, ice cream and some fruits made up the dessert area.Lucky we had senior citizens' discount. Not worth the original price.
4
We visited the restaurant on National Day and had a pleasant surprise as the restaurant offered 20% discount on buffet. Food spread is good, and they keep replenish it. We had lobster, crab, steak, etc. Will come to visit again. Btw, it's a certified halal restaurant.
4
The buffet caters to a wide variety of tastes, from the seafood to the salad bar and the mains. Could have had more drink options though
3
Food is good except limited in variety. It is a great place for family as it is not too crowded. We had 20 in the place and it was swell
3
Visited the restaurant twice. Once for dinner few years back and one in recent months.The service is consistently good and warm. I personally find the buffet spread a little limited for the price. Lots of Asian food and if you're a lover for Asian food, I think it's quite worth visit. For the two visits I've made, there isn't much crowd and we can usually get a table by booking on the actual day or do a walk in
4
even though I had a last minute reservation and stated in remarks that we'll be celebrating my husband's birthday, the staff noted it and even sang us a birthday song while presenting the cake. awesome!variety of food and the lamb was oh so delish. and with a great promotion (July) it's very affordable
4
I take breakfast with my friend at this restaurant, when you eat please bring your breakfast voucher to the waiters.. food was vary, so get eat..
4
Good quality food with reasonable spread for an affordable price. Will make a return visit with family
4
Great selection of food. Food was fresh (especially the seafood). Restaurant is spacious and clean. Will return for more!
4
I've only eaten here once so I can't give this restaurant a thorough review. But the customer service was great. Place was busy. The French toast was really good and so were the seafood noodles. Wasn't the best food that I have ever eaten but I was not disappointed. I would definitely eat here again.
5
Went there yesterday for dinner. It was my 5th visit to e Restaurant, always with a different group of family or friends.. They never dissappoints me. The food served were always fresh, well cooked and taste delicious.. The ambience was welcoming and relaxing with clean simple soft colours.. That night special mention to 3 of their staff for e night, a very big thank you to Lily at cashier, Einstein and The ever friendly & helpful (Bespectable Guy-sorry nvr get his name) both waiters at our table. Actually i noticed that all their staff have a high level of service. Well done !! Good job See u guys again soon..

My Wife and I tried the buffet lunch at this restaurant and found the food variety and the friendly staff to be excellent. Hope this review help inspire the restaurant to maintain its standards
5
The food taste delicious and wonderful.The spread was excellent.Food regularly topped-up.Staff was very friendly and helpful.Value for money
4
The food was good. Eventhough there is not much variety, taste was up to expectation. A number of their staff are friendly and helpful. However, some are not so approachable and friendly. Keep up the good work though.
5
Excellent experience as usual. 1-for-1 lunch buffet was worth it. Great food, great service and cheerful atmosphere
4
This is a clean and well run place that offers a Mediterranean Halal buffet with some local dishes, too.The staff is friendly and attentive and the ambiance is pleasant. When the place is crowded the buffet area seems a bit too cramped. SGD 55++ on a weekend is a hefty price tag, in my opinion.
5
 I was having lunch with a few friends @ 21 on Rajah on 9thJuly. I told them that the food is great n the service is excellent in this restaurant. We were served by a pretty petite lady, Agnes. She's all smile, greeted us n ushered us to our table. She recommended my friends their specialties and hosted us throughout our meal. Not only having more than enough to eat, we also felt pampered by Agnes. Clearing our plates, pouring drinks and even had small chats with us. My friends and I really felt at home with warmth from Agnes. We kept calling her over for chats forgetting she's on the job. Thanks Agnes! It's good to have you. You make our life good. Will come back again and again with more friends, for the food as well as for your service. Appreciate what you have done
4
Considered quite expensive with not much variety of food being offered. However, food was nice, especially the black pepper lobster, and the asam fish. Dessert corner was normal. Staff was efficient in their duties, for eg. clearing of plates, adding normal plain water into our cups whenever is needed, etc. Location was easy to find
3
This restaurant has arguably the best service staff I encountered in a restaurant of this range. They are attentive and polite. They fill your water without you having to ask for it, they clear your plates promptly whenever they see it is ready to be cleared. In many restaurants which offer buffets, the service staff have to be called to clear the plates. And, it is not this restaurant was empty, it was about three quarters full. The food spread is mediocre but the taste and freshness is good. No complaints. Best of all, if you are a senior, there is a discount accorded.Give it a try, you will not regret it
4
Reasonable price, quality food, good spread & nice ambience. Staff were friendly and helpful.Best dish was the oven Grille Lamb.The hotel Days Inn has feeder bus service from Novena & Newton MRT stations
5
On different days they will have different stuff - for example, during Ramadan they had nasi ambeng (rice platter with dishes) and on public holidays they had a mediterranean - asian spin to the dishes they put up. Be sure to check with the Restaurant what they are serving up. I had beef rendang, yellow rice, chicken cooked with tomato and chilli (ayam masak merah), slipper lobster in chilli crab sauce, mantou along with maggi mee goreng and seafood goreng. All yummy, except that maybe the slipper lobster was a bit salty (nature of the taste of slipper lobsters?) The cake selection is not bad too and they have fresh fruits to end off your meal! I will choose this place over Carousell because while the food selection is much smaller, the quality of the food is higher and the service is ALWAYS friendly. That counts for a lot
5
the service was excellent, with great ambiance with excellent food! i enjoyed it very much. will be looking forward to visit again & ask my friends along
5
Great variety of dishes and very nicely cooked .. Staff is friendly and nice ... Loved the beef and lobster .. Also the kebab .. They even have my favorite cheese and bread
5
Not much variety but quality of food is good. However, it is much more expensive compared to the previous tim
3
Not much varieties of food.the yellow rice not fluffy a bit hard and cold.so far i like the ambience
3
I had brought my husband and young daughter to 21 on Rajah to celebrate my husband's birthday. Since it was the fasting month, there were many Muslim customers who were with friends and family. My husband and I were disappointed that they did not announce the call of prayer through their PA system in the restaurant. We were quite vague on whether it was time to break fast yet or not. We were only informed when a couple from the next table told us that it was time. Also the Saffron yellow rice from the buffet table was not cooked properly. It was rough and had a raw taste. It was quite a put off to eat this kind of rice.
3
We stayed at the hotel and enjoyed the breakfast buffet there. Enough choices for both international and asian palates.
5
Good food being served. Nice ambience & most importantly,great service from the people there. Well done
4
Went there with a group of friends for dinner. Food spread was adequate but very tasty. The rib eye and lamb leg is a must try! Another win is the live station of 'maggi goreng' which you can choose your level of spiciness which is oh so yummy ‚ù§
4
Staff are friendly and very helpful.Food varieties are not alot maybe because it's weekday. But food is still tasty and fresh.Hope to have more food range to treat our tastebug on our next visit.
4
My first time trying out 21 on Rajah. The place is so clean, fresh and the food is awesome. It is worth the price and variety. The seafood on ice has scallops, mussels, prawns, lobsters and crab claw. It is a very simple buffet spread yet amazing. Looking forward to dine on a regular menu.The NZ prime beef carving is so juicy!!
5
Food spread was really awesome, it was topped up at every interval. Never an empty space. Cordial drinks was abit too thick for my liking however, teh tarik was one of the best. Staffs were very accommodating, as well. It has been a great experience for the husband and I.
4
We were looking for a Halal restaurant to celebrate a malay friend's birthday. There are limited selection in Singapore and I was surprise that 21 on Rajah just outside my home is a Halal Restaurant.We arrived and was surprise how spacious, bright, clean and lively the restaurant is. Proceeded to the food section and was WOWed by the seafood selection and sushi corner. Then I saw the MILO DINOSAUR!!! CHENDOL!!! and ROSE SYRUP!! It's a true Halal restaurant. Moving inwards i saw a range of delicious malay dishes and i was overjoyed.I was also very thankful when i asked the staff if they have a birthday cake as we forgot to buy, she said they will give us a complimentary cake to celebrate my friend's birthday. Top service. All the staff were very well mannered and helpful.Truly this is a restaurant i will recommend all my Muslim friends and I might come back myself seeing that it's so near my home.Good Work
5
Went in the month of Ramadhan. My first visit to the place.Am amazed at the food. The food is really great! The lamb.. beef.. dessert.. seafood.. yummy!The service is also good. Very prompt service.Excellent place for me..
5
Great dining experience. Provide rooms for prayers and the food is superb. Shld try it out during and after Ramadhan. I find that the price is reasonable
4
Had Iftar here with the missus over the weekend. Nice restaurant. Spacious seating areas with nice deco. Buffet was pretty good. Quite a wide selection of food. My favorite of the night was the beef lasagne.The sambal crayfish was tasty and tangy, but a little overcooked.Buffet serving area was very cramped though. Quite hard to move when everyone is waiting in line on 2 aisles and moving in both directions. The management should use the loads of space that they have and use some of that real estate to improve the buffet area. It will definitely enhance the dining experience. That's the main reason that they don't get 5 ticks from me
4
Although the food is of limited variety, the food is good. Quickness of replenishing food items is great. The ambience is good. Staff is always on the go clearing plates and ensuring cleanliness of the restaurant. Thumps up!
5
Ambience were damn good buffet spread were way too fantastic. Love the bread pudding. Worth the money i should say. This is my second time having dinner there with friends. Wish i could to go there again with my family this June 24 for the special day which is my 51 Birthday!!!!! :
4
A wonderful experience with family after along time. Celebrate Father's Day early with my love ones. Nice buffet spread for whole family to enjoy
5
Meal: I love the food served. Fresh seafood and salmon, in fact better than the ones I had in better rated hotels. The variety is endless! Loved it!I had the iftar promotion, and it meant more dishes on the buffet spread. I'm not sure about everyone else, but I think the ambeng tray idea should be scrapped to avoid food wastage. The highlight was the dessert, durian mousse was yummy.Atmosphere: It was clean, family-friendly place to dine in.Service: Waiters are very kind and almost armed with a smile. The waitresses could learn some etiquette from the male counterparts
5
Great spread of choices, excellent service crew and great value for money! Although maybe I would like to see more variety of cakes and an addition of sashimi
5
Me and my family are so happy to meet this good looking young man, Jonathan. He help us a lot on everything. Especially when he has work on hand, but he put it aside and assists the guests first. Words can't express how great is his service to the guests. We just wanna say thank you very much Jonathan! You are the best! We will definitely gonna come back again just because of your great services
3
We came with friends in the late afternoon for drinks and snacks. The food and service was average. Noticed that it was popular for buffet meals which we did not try
5
I would totally recommend and come again(and this is my 2nd time here). It was so good! I love the Durian Mousse. Mine and my boyfriend's ultimate favorite.
3
I like the spaciousness of this place but the food is mediocre at its best. The serving staff lacks initiative and took forever to serve or refill water despite us waving many times. Definitely will not go back again
5
They made effort to provide separate hotel rooms made available to both male and female patrons. Allocated timings for patrons to perform their prayer and return to enjoy their buffet spread. Provided prayer mats and compass to find Qibla.Great job and thank you 21 on Rajah
5
I had a great time! The buffet spread was amazing and the staff had even help us prepare some cakes for my colleagues' birthday.
5
Good food,friendly staff, provide room for solat .the food is very delicious. Ambience good for ramadan break fast with family
4
Enjoyed the durian mousse at the buffet spread. Variety of food was satisfying. Taste was excellent as well
4
Very accommodating to our 15 pax reservation and went extra mile for the complimentary birthday cakes for my 2 friend
3
Not bad but can do better with the roasted beef. Too tough and dry. The selection is not as much as other place but good hair for money. Booking through chope entitled to 10% disc. Not bad
5
I was there on 24May 2016 with my wife for the first time having buffet. The buffet price is affordable and the presentation is appropriate. The food was delicious and each time the food run out, the staff will top up quickly. And the staff services were great and they will go around to check and clear all the soil plates. Jonathan Ho is one of them whom i can see that he is very fast on clearing the soil plates. Before i could go off, he came over to my table and ask how is our meal and is there any improvement for the food. He smile with sincerity and thank us for coming to have lunch. i can see that Jonathan can go far in his career and hope that the management will share this feedback with him
5
Quite a variety of foods and the food are yummy. The maggie goreng was spicy and delicious. My hubby recommends the place.
3
The dinner buffet price was $55 per head instead of $40 per head as I read from the website. Also I was not given the 10% discount as offered by CHOPE website. In all I could have paid between $50 to $60 more for the buffet dinner for 3. So the value for money score is poor for the total price of $194. Staff explained that prices and no discount policy apply during this fasting period.
5
Went for the Sunday Brunch. For the price of $40++ with 10% credit card promo. Came with quality roasted prime ribeye beef, lobsters (on ice), slipper lobster, lamb shank and decent nyonya deserts. Good service from the staff too. Overall worth the price and went home satisfied and of course, dinner skipped as well :))
4
Not so much a buffet eater. But reserved seats to celebrate sisters birthday. They loved the concept of the place & also the variety of food. Staffs were friendly
4
The booking was smooth and they call a day before the actual day to confirm the booking lest there were changes. The spread was not as large as one would like, but overall sufficient with cold dishes, and warm ones. The roast was excellent. In terms of service, I must say, one of the most fast and courteous lot. The overall experience was good!
3
The roast beef was good, other than that the desert selection consisted a good spread of cakes, chocolate fondue and 'potong' aka ice cream stick.The other dishes like salad, hot dishes, sushi bar and free flow beverages such as Bandung & bird nest tea (tasted rather diluted) were not outstanding. It was a treat from colleagues, probably won't return again unless the menu variety improves
5
The food and the service was excellent. The food was nicely balanced. The settings was very nice. The food as tasty. The staff was very friendly
5
Had buffet lunch with my wife on 27th May 2016. The food was very good standards. The roast was great. It could have been better if it was done medium rare instead of well done in parts. The best part of the buffet was the service provided by Lily . Glad to have met her. An asset in any service industry
5
Had dinner on 25/5 with my husband. Impressed with the settings of the restaurant. Love the beef and the seafood. The Service was excellent, especially Miss Lily, she was full of smile n I could feel the warmth n her sincerity to ensure that we were comfortable . We definitely will come back for more, not only for food, but also for the service. Thank you Miss Lily. Keep up the good service
4
The food was scrumptious! The beef was my favourite. Although the variety of food was a little disappointing.
4
Great service, clean and casual restaurant. Good and satisfying lunch spread. Restaurant is able to accommodate large groups
4
So pleased to see comfort food favourites like tempeh, ayam masak merah, rojak and begedil served here. Place is inviting and comfy, blue and white tones, for a relaxing lunch. Great for lunch gatherings too as this place is halal-certified.Enjoyed the rice too, although not basmati, but it is chewy yet fluffy, the kind I like. Fragrant with saffron and raisins. There's also a pasta live station and a carving station that doled out roast beef. A bit dry but tasty with many sauces to choose from.There's also a Japanese corner with some sushi, and boiled prawns and scallops. There's also bread, soup and butter, as well as a salad station.Overall good assortment of savouries: with fish, seafood, chicken, beef available when I visited. Some of the western desserts are too sweet, but the Asian desserts are pretty good. There's also Boncafe coffee and fruit punch.Went for the 1-for-1 UOB offer, which brought the bill to sub-$20 per pax. Will visit again
4
The variety was enough to fill all the space in the tummy and to give thumbs up. We were attended by a very attentive staff, Ms Lily.A good place to sit and enjoy the food and chat with family/friends
5
Great service, clean and very peaceful ambience.There was a wide spread of food and was definitely satisfied. Nice range of desserts too
4
Second visit with little sister. Worth the trip and the money although the food variety is pretty small. But very good service and food quality. Little sister enjoyed the gelato machine, very much.
4
Food was tasty but there wasn't much variety but it is definitely the price you've paid for. Among my favourites were the steak, spicy lobster plus the durian mousse! Favourite beverage would be the bird nest's tea.
5
Laksa tasted good with loads of prawns.The service staffs was very kind and helpful.Very clean restaurant ambience ideal for family, entertaining business clients 
5
A few months I gave a low review score. Now Rajah 21 deserves a 5*. We had lunch there today, our 4th or 5th visit. Wonderful lunch, exceptional service, happy chefs and smiley service staff. A joy to eat there. Salmon was cook to perfection, I believe the salmon was baked in dough case, troublesome preparation with perfect result. Cold prawns and mussels were much better than before. Everything were tasty, except tapioca kueh that was off. Great
3
Not much of choices. Selectively some are good such as salad, churros and fresh sashimi. The rest.. Just so so.
4
A nice introduction for my family.Attentive staff, beautiful ambience & great food spread.A place to consider for all
5
Love the dishes at the buffet. Dessert however, was a tad disappointing but I guess the other dishes made up for it :
3
Nice cosy ambience. Buffet spread was ok. Good for those who are small eaters. We were there on Friday night for dinner. First thing that caught our eyes was the roast lamb. However it was a bit dry for our liking. The other main dishes were a bit cold. We do like the laksa though.Was actually looking forward to paella but it was not served that night. So we settled for pasta instead. As for the cold seafood..it was ok. The crabs was tasty but the prawns lacked the sweetness. The mussels were huge! Desserts and fruits was a good spread. There was no bread pudding but they had pandan churros.Love the way they displayed the drinks! Very creative and pretty. We ended it off with a good cup of expresso. Overall, it was ok but unlikely to revisit
4
It was my 3rd visit with my family to celebrate Mothers' Day. Great environment to enjoy our dinner. Friendly staffs
5
Celebrated Mother's Day and was very pleased with the buffet spread. Dessert spread was very nice as well
1
The food variety is very few. The customer service is horrible as my friends and I had to wait for about 15mins before we are being served. And the food was not topped up
5
Great ambience, and the service was prompt and proper. Food was really nice too. Dessert menu was excellent!
5
I'd recommend the carved meat, desserts station and salad station. The sushi station was not quite impressive as the salmon wasn't that fresh, the seafood station wasn't that impressive either. Again, the restaurant is know for their Mediterranean cuisines, not for sushi and seafood. Still a good price to pay,not complaining their white chocolate fondue is the bomb, and their soft serve vanilla ice cream. ( agreed by a group of adults) Overall excellent service and since they constantly topup their food stations ( I rate by that ) I give this place full marks. If you're looking for seafood, go Aqua Marine and prepare to pay the price of course. 10% off total bill which is $42.40 per head, I'm happy.
3
The lunch buffet is rather expensive but has limited spread. The food quality were only average and nothing worth mentioning. Would not be coming back again any time soon "o
5
Worth it for the price paid. While there were hits and misses with the food as with buffet menus, there was still a good variety to satisfy everyone's palates. Food was promptly topped up. Staff were attentive and helpful
3
Went 21 on Rajah to celebrate husband's bday... Was surprised to see a balloon tied to the chair... Food variety was okay for the price we pay... Taste wise is good... Staffs were attentive to customers' needs... Ambience was great... Very nice place with bright colours... But the bad part was that 21 on Rajah could not accede to any bday requests... Not like the other restaurants that I went to...
1
I was there with a big group of my colleagues, partners and their kids. We were sitting not too far from a group who was making far too much noise. Not by eating but continuing their activity as a group management session. Emmerze Pte Ltd as we could see from their tees. They were cheering loudly, with 1 of the lady uses a loudhailer to speak to the group, ignoring the rest of the diners who wanted to talk and dine in peace. Management should at least be in charge to ask them nicely to be courteous to other paying patrons instead of making the area as their own. Wont visit there anymore, sadly
4
There's always people attending to us. Asking us if we need top up of water and clearing away our plates frequently when we are done. Great service guys! Thank you!
4
Love the attentive service n great food. The cake of e month, Pistachio Cake is delicious.. Love e Roast beef too.. Overall great experience.
4
Good time for family dinnner. The food is great but not much of variety..The place is too cold for the kids. They keep complaining about it
3
Service was okay. its cost abt 30 buck. And food variety was okay. Not much dont expect like aquamarine or strait kitchen type of buffet. Food taste okay.
5
They have very good service & nice ambience! The price for buffet is acceptable & it is worth it. :)
3
Did not feel much ambience as other reviewers have commented, though that depends to an extent on other diners and waiting staff. Quickly shown to table but a brief explanation as to what was available and where it was would have been nice. Interesting to find that the soup was past the deserts, then the sushi and the salads!. Maybe its a Western dining experience that soup is positioned near the front.Sushi was tasteless as was the fish and the salad looked and tasted "tired". Overall not an experience that I look back on fondly
2
My old soldiers, sub-commanders who spent a bit of their young lives doing ICT together, met up for dinner. Our wives came along. What made the night meaningful, not the food. For the amount of money we paid, the spread was rather average. I started with some corn soup and salad. The salad was promising. The soup looked like shark's fins until you see the bits of corn. Only the bite of the bits of corn made me feel like I was having corn soup. Taste wise, it could have been better. It would be great to label the many dressings available, or maybe I missed them!They seemed to have a problem with topping up. It was only 6.30pm(buffet started at 6pm) and only the legs of the crabs were available. When one of us asked about the body, yhe answer given was like the bodies of the crabs are kept or finished. I probably needed more time for the rationale to be understood. A buffet spread where you hold back on top ups is not my idea of a good one! And its not cheap by any means. The same went for many other food items served. Even the lamb was left in a mess with little rice left. I lost my appetite somewhere between the pasta and the bread and butter pudding. The pasta and many other dishes will not do good to your salt intake. All very saltish! The bread and butter pudding was dry and bland. The sauce did little to make it better. It clearly needed more sugar!The item that was good need notbe cooked at all. The fruits. All looked and tasted fresh. Its commendable that the restaurant provided 2 rooms for us to do our prayers. But as a good establishment , the standard of food served and the frequencies must be there. Otherwise we would have to wait more than eating, unless you just have what is available, like having your dessert just after appetiser... Patrons would gladly be happy to pay for real good food. For me, only the company made the visit worth it all
5
Your platform is so easy to use. More importantly my bookings went through and i have a great time at 21 on rajah. Will recommend chope and 21 on rajah to my friends and relatives. Well done!! Cheers
2
Was expecting alot of food spread. Top up of food was not immediately.Price wise was a bit expensive. Should rather top up a bit more and had our dinner at corousel
4
You will love the ambience.Currently on promo (which I didnt know) was the 50% off for Senior citizens above 50 years of age for the buffet on weekdays.The range of buffet spread may not be varied, but it was something healthy and worth going for 2nd, 3rd round. II must say, from the way the food was prepared, the chef wanted it to be nutritious, healthy and delicious! Well done !My friends and I love the Pumpkin soup, the Roast Lamb with Homemade sauce, the E-fu noodles, just to name a few.There is this Tomato Coriander Chilli Sauce and Green Wasabi Mayonaise sauce that really goes well with the chilled seafood. Yummy!At the end, when the bill came, it was a nice surprise to see a bill for S$43+ for 3 adults paying
4
Our family arrived earlier than the appointed time, but was immediately shown to our table. Our special requests for prayer facilities and a birthday cake was met without question. Staff were courteous, helpful and friendly.
3
When someone goes to a restaurant buffet paying more than his/her average daily lunch budget, one might hope to experience something special. 21 on Rajah might let you down when it comes to variety of dishes they serve. There will not be nothing special on the menu that piques your curiosity, but the quality might not be so bad. Sea food is so so. Main course was some noodle which tasted exactly like the one which you would get from hawker centers (not judging the hawker centers).Desserts seemed to be their specialty and they packed some decent varieties in that department. Now comes the 'but'; there is only one ice cream dispensing machine that creates a long queue and waiting is not something which you would enjoy amidst a meal. Price was around S$35 pax, which is not in the gourmet range but they could do better with that price tag on
5
Quality and variety of food is good; service is courteous, prompt and discreet. Very good value for money, especially with generous senior discount of 50%. Restaurant is spacious, clean, sits next to a lovely park, easily accessible
4
my requested that the birthday song to provide.... cos on the day your staff sing for us.... to make it great that...
4
friendly service and the food is delicious, will certainly come again bring more friends and family.
4
The variety of food are not a lot. Food quality are acceptable not nothing wow. Live Station (Laksa & Egg) are not very prominent.
5
Highly recommended, staff was really friendly. Food choices was superb and the taste is beyond words
4
I've been to the lunch buffet on several occasions and I liked the spread. However, I find the dinner spread slightly disappointing. The carbonara was watery and the black pepper chicken was popcorn chicken in black pepper sauce. The rest of the spread was alright but nothing splendid. Service was great tho. Staff was very helpful in serving birthday cakes to my family members even though we did not arrange it before hand
5
Simply hassle free reservation and honest to goodness flow of processes. The dining experience was far beyond expectation. The staffs were sincerely polite and courteous. Prompt and excellent service.Well done
5
Service was good especially Ivy. Thank you for your kind service. Having a good food worth of penny. My Wife really like black paper lobster cook by chef Redzuan. Will definely come back again
5
The place is so nice and the food are awesome! I must say the service at 21 on Rajah was superb! They have excellent customer service and they have served me and my friend well. I will surely come again! :
4
good service and the food was nice! however, the refill of the lobster was not frequent enough. drinks were good and beef too.
4
Food was good, great spread of hot buffet and excellent Prime rib.Deserts were a bit short on quantity and quality.casual atmosphere. Good attentive staff
5
Food and value was really excellent. Service staffs were attentive. The food was actively being refilled.
4
Bright and clean dining area. Very tasty food.Helpful waitresses and receptionist.Very reasonable price for a Friday dinner. Convenient place to drive to on a Friday :)
4
I had daily breakfast here. I found this restaurant very clean with good quality food. It is located in Days hotel and near to Ramada Hotel.
4
A bit sterile, but good range of food and prompt service. Prawns and crab legs on dinner buffet, a range of roasted meats, Asian and European food styles.
3
We had our reunion dinner on the 7/2/2016 and the buffet spread was not bad. The staffs were very prompt in removing the used plates and bowls. I would have given a 4 out of 5 rating if not for the absurd promotion given by May Bank.We reserved the dinner in early Jan and was told that if we could make a partial or full payment early, we will be given 10% discount (a promotion given by May Bank). We made the full payment on 4/1/2016 and was given the discount.However, we realised that there was a better promotion by May Bank for reservation and payment that was done later, 15% instead of 10%. This means that "early bird" is not really better.As the saying goes, "early bird catches the worm"... I guess in this case "later bird catches a fatter worm"
2
Food spread was very limited and not replenished. Cold section - Only had some prawns and mussels. Sushi pieces were very limited. Flies hovering on the sushi and at dining tables. Hot food were very limited -8 maybe? With rice and noodles included.Good stuff -Only the live laksa station. Tasty and hot
4
The food is good although can do with more varieties. Nice ambience. More importantly, the service are very good and attentive in particular one Mr Ernest who is very helpful and attentive to customers' needs
5
We've tried their buffet and was very satisfied. Today we tried their ala carte. And...Ooh. Amazing.Service was attentive yet not intrusive. Excellent.The portions are very generous and the quality was very good.We ordered one mushroom soup. Kids spaghetti. And seafood paella.2 adults one kidWhile waiting for the paella we were offered a nice bread and salsa appetizerThe mushroom Soup was huge and flavourful. With crispy garlic toast.The kids spaghetti. See pic. Unbelievably good. The meaty chunks were tender and melt in your mouth good. Kid ate it all. I wanted some :(The seafood paella was awesome with juicy seafood and tender chicken.Enuff for 2 pax.We thoroughly enjoyed our Lunch. Thank yo
3
Almost everything were salty. For the price we paid for, I don't think it is worth it. Food spread weren't that much
3
Different day has different theme (food: Italian, Spanish...etc)$39.00++ per pax. It is a halal restaurant (so they don't serve alcohol)Food: Cold crab (love the crab leg), prawn was so fresh, scallop, mussels, sushi, salmon sashimi, salad bar, soup of the day, bread / crackers, cheese (4-5 kinds of cheese), roast beff, roast vegetable, lasagne, Spanish seafood rice (paella), fish, chickenDessert: Brownie, black forest cake, macha cake, creme brulee, pana cotta, tiramisu, durian creme (very nice), tau suan...coffee / tea / 3 cold drinks Overall: 3.3/5Service: 3/
5
Nice location with good atmosphere. The food selection was good but it will be great to have much more. Roast beef and sushi selection was superb!
3
Stayed at Days Hotel, rates inclusive of breakfast at 21 on Rajah. Decent spread for breakfast. The menu are different for the 2 days I stayed. Nice cosy plan to do events as well.
3
There wasn't many varieties of food on that day and the stations that I enjoyed were only the sushi and seafood station. everything else was average but the atmosphere was above average - clean, family-friendly and not crowded at all.
5
The ambience and service were perfect. Good spread for a weekend brunch and all tasted yummy. And, kudos to the chef who cooked a delicious crayfish dish.
4
Had a birthday celebration here. love the Christmas atmosphere. there was a wide spread of food choices. surprisinly, they served turkey and steak on that day. it was such a splendid day to spend with your loved ones!
2
Same fixed menu 3 days in a row for breakfast - quite disappointing - limited choices for vegetarians, table tops not very clean. Better to have breakfast elsewhere
4
The food was good and the staff was friendly. The pricing was affordable as well. And with the Chope discounted pricing, it made everything much more affordable. Would love to go here again to try out their different theme and cuisines.
5
Great customer service! Very driendly and helpful staffs whom were very patient with 3 hyperactive toddlers. Food were frequently top up despite nearing the end of the buffet lunch. Definitely value for money.

My family and I celebrated my sister's 21st birthday at 21 on rajah. I knew the quality and spread of the food, having been there twice before, would be all right. The food did not disappoint although I am looking forward to a different spread if I visit next year. The roast was juicy. Dessert spread was varied. The rojak and ice cream corner were a hit. About 6 different types of seafood, cooked dishes, salads, cold cuts etc... the only thing that annoyed me was that I discreetly asked for cake (they don't have whole ones, only slices) from the server as I had spoken to the staff at the cashier prior to entering. The server went "HUH? CAKE? FOR WHO?" out loud, during which the birthday girl whipped her head in my direction ruining the surprise. Mind you, the birthday girl was sitting at end of another table. This isnt the first time my table's cake surprise was ruined. The last time we came, we went to the kitchen staff to ask for our cake we had bought that they had kept. Only to have one of thr servers come to our table asking "Sorry ah, which one is your cake ah" out loud thus ruining the cake surprise. So come here to enjoy the food and the company of your friends. If you want to surprise someone with cake, be prepared to laugh at how funnily indiscreet they are

I made reservations under chope and it was confirmed. Unfortunately when reached 21 on rajah, my reservation was not capture and we had to wait for the tables and chairs to be setup. I suggest to the manager to give up others reservation table for us first since we are here first and they are late. Luckily she agreed. Thanks to the manager working on 23 Dec 15.The food has not variety but most of it has quality and tasty. It was on Wednesday so the menu is international buffet. I understand that each day they offer different cuisine.Since we booked under chope and so we enjoy 20% discount. Which is worth it. Lesson learnt, after booking with chope, call again 21 on rajah to confirm the reservation.Overall we had good experience dining in 21 on rajah
5
Had late lunch from the menu. We ordered Narsi goring and Moorish chicken. Both dishes were brilliant. And the service was amazing. Even charged my iPhone for me.
4
The setting of the restaurant was very nice and chilling. Food was great though more vaerity will be better. Loved the steak!
5
The spread is quite wide and the quality of the food is really good. The angus beef has to be the must try dish here.
4
We had a good brunch. Although the spread weren't massive, they were tasty. The dining space was great too and were sat comfortably too.
5
Clean restaurant! Food is good but a little expensive. Than again, what is cheap in Singapore ;-)
I recommend this place.
5
Ambience was good. Food was value for money. Lovely experience. There is a choice for everyone in my family, ranging from 7-48 years old.
5
Great services and ambience. For the price is worth it... Recommend for family or friends outings. Give it a try.

We had a company dinner on the 17th Dec. We chose the 21 on Rajah because it was Halal. We started out with our choice of Beverage in a Lookalike Milk Bottle which i found was very fascinating. There were3 choices to choose from. I recommend the orange looking beverage. I had a little of each like the Sashimi , Cold appetizers, Seafood on ice and the Hot items. I wish there were more seafood selection on ice, as there were basically just the small scallop, mussels and prawns. The Hot items were pretty good minus the Mash potato which was too soggy, Given the Christmas festive season, i thought another choice of creamy soup would have been an ideal choice instead of the clear broth. The highlight of the evening was the Angus roast which I thought was pretty tasty along with the given sause and condiments. The Dessert was simple and tasty. Overall it was a decent meal given that the price was not over the top
3
Disappointed with the food selections.Had dinner with my family on the 2nd week for my birthday celebrations ,too much of Christmas stuff/food as I was not very keen .Prefer local or normal western dishes.Turkey was not favourable to the customers as seen and Christmas dessert were not appropriate to serve so early.Sushi selections gone so fast and need reminders to replenish.No plain rice and not much hot dishes .Tomato soup,such a turned off!Desert choices were more than salad or the entree despite all the Christmas cookies tasted the same .Nothing much too eat for the value .Salad were pathetic .Looking forward for the tau suan but yew char Kway finished and too starchy like eating glue.Will not come back 
4
Pros:Food something similar to Carousel, but at a fraction of the cost and variety. Value-for-money are cold dish (clams, crayfish, scallops etc), baked solid salmon fish ( drizzle with cream), lobster/crayfish curry (runs out fast!) and mini salad bar (quality serving of greens and sides). Desserts ranges fr crepe station, choc fondue to cream cakes etc. Cons:Give pancake and waffle a miss, as it's too dry, unless you eat with ice cream (which I noticed most patrons do that). For those who thrives on red meat, the brunch only seems to serve turkey & lamb chop curries.Food - can never get too overwhelming. Price - at the price offered, this is definitely worth going & a 10% credit card promo. Service - Not sure too if they do frequent topping-up of food for I didn't get to savour the sushi (salmon) and lobster/crayfish curry (seems to be running low) . Also, I ended with quite a thirst after the meal.
3
Spread of food is not as expected.Hoping for more variety of buffet spread .Complimentary cake can be better
4
It was good. The food was delicious. Overall, the place was good for family occasion & wedding events.
4
We love the food. Service staff were very helpful and friendly. Spacious dining and very kid-friendly.
5
10times better than 1market at Plaza Singapura. Best halal buffet that I've been. Of course it's quite pricey lah.
5
Very good.. staff all friendly. Food all good. Went there for my son bday Celebration. My family are very happy with the service.
5
It's so easy to book ! Seats are right there with good timing selections! Now we don't have to worry for public holidays!
4
Food and ambience awesome. Providing Muslim prayer room was a plus! Will definitely recommend friends.
4
Desserts awesome. Food finish too fast. So can be better if top ups are faster. Staff can be more friendly and warm.
1
I'm quite disappointed looking at the choices of food for lunch. Honestly not worth the money to be paying for the kind of varieties for lunch. Not trying to be rude but even Sakura or Seoul garden choices are way much better. Yes I know it's a little bit more costly because it is located at a hotel but just a disappointment because we were expecting something more exciting. Maybe you should change your choices of food for lunch even the ice cream was terrible
3
I went on a weekday for lunch to celebrate my sister's wedding anniversary and my husband's birthday. So I had requested them for a complimentary cake. Which they did bring and sang a birthday song for my husband. Great Service and ambience. Buffet price was resonable. The variety of dishes was poor. Cold dish was prawns and mussel, 4-5 variety of sushi, 4-5 variety of malay kueh kueh, yogurt and toppings, salad corner, 4 variety fresh fruits. Main course lacked variety. Dissapointed. The only dish that was delicious was lamb and the brown sauce.
4
A good halal certified buffet. But price could have been cheaper. Still worth it for a corporate lunch meal
4
Service is very good.
However choices of food isn't much. Clean and comfortable ambience. Child friendly
4
The food spread was sufficient. Taste wise, most were hits (roasted beef &veg, salad spread, crayfish) but some misses (gelato, fondue, crab legs had icicles in them). But overall, experience was lovely. Staff was prompt and accomodating. Definitely coming back.
5
They were having morrocan night. Lamb was marvellous. Seafood display was out of this world. Recommended!
5
Went to celebrate my wife birthday, staffs there came with a birthday cake and with singing. A good night to remember. Keep it up!
4
Dinner was ok.should have more varieties of food. Change of dessert spread. Overall all was ok . Will definitely visit again
3
Staffs are present and attentive.
Food are average and sushi was not refilled promptly.
Nice place for dinning
3
I went with my husband to celebrate our anniversary, for dinner. Previously I went with my colleagues for lunch. That day, Monday is Italian. For seafood there's only crab, scallop, mussels and prawns. There's sushi which quite ok. Gelato which doesn't taste like gelato. Quite disappointed with the cakes or kuih corner, not that nice. I only like the panna cotta and durian mousse. We love the rib eye beef, chicken, potato salad and that's it. The pasta not well cooked, and the coffee sucks. Most likely may not go there again
5
Needless to say, my colleagues and I came because we wanted to eat good food. The restaurant did not disappoint us. The food was delicious and fresh. The service was also excellent as I asked if the hotel has a prayer room. Even though the hotel was running at full capacity, they managed to convert two rooms as prayer rooms. The wait staff was very quick to attend to our needs as well and they were attentive and friendly.
2
Went to eat the dinner buffet as a group of 25 people. Asked for the private dinning but was told it was booked but it wasn't used at all! Service staff is only interested in our credit card details and not at all flexible to the group needs. Disappointing. It is the first time we met a restaurant that is so inflexible
4
Good food and great service! Ambience is nice. Will be great if more food choices available. But overall it was a good experience.
4
Fresh food and taste great! Just wish that the surprise bdae cake is not the same as the ones at the desert corner. Doesnt feel as special.
5
Excellent dinner location to celebrate any event. Service was good. Worth every cents spend. Great. .
3
Food taste is nice,quality was good. I think to improvise is to add more variety of food, with this,even if you raise the value,it is still worth it.
4
Had a dine'in with my fianc√©e for her birthday. A real good place to just relax and have a sufficient variety of good food. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city areas.
5
Food was superb, especially the desserts and seafood on ice! But would be even better if there were much more variety.
4
We came on a Tuesday, and the restaurant was not even half full which was great for us. Beautiful interior, food selection was not that big BUT it was tasty, esp the pasta and prawn noodle (!!) and my husband loved the rib eye. Dessert spread was not so much but it was okay for the price we paid for ($75+ after 20% Chope discount + Mastercard). Will come again

50 points to 21 on Rajah for- beautifully decorated, spacious restaurant. The place feels light and airy, with lots of natural lighting and high ceilings. - kids activity corner plus a mini buffet set up. I think this is only available on Sunday brunches though but there is a guided craft corner where kids can do colouring and painting.- many on-going promotions, check their Facebook page for offers- good price, esp with the offers.- wide variety of condiments with the food- service came with smiles, they were efficient at clearing plates and topping up your glassesDeduct 5 points for- food variety is average. There were no real standouts for me, nothing was really worth going back for seconds.- food layout is cramped. While the seating space was sprawling, the food counters were all squeezed into a corner that only allowed for one way traffic, which could really cause a backlog if the restaurant was at full capacity.- there was a live crepe station, but no one was there. When we approached the staff, he didn't seem very sure of what to do and I wouldn't describe what we got as a 'crepe'
3
wasn't serve ice water. need to request.wasn't serve children plastic utensils though there is one children age 2. need to request.wasn't ask about the additional comment made during reservation. birthday cake was requested via chope under comment during reservation. need to request.basically no initiative made at all.
4
Review is only for breakfast:Live counter for egg items. chef prepares fried eggs, omlets with various toppings and also custom preparations over the counter.Have all the usual continental items like cereals, milk, juice, croissants, ham, and other items. In addition, you can get noodles, and also couple of Indian dishes like dosa, idli and sambar. Not very great, but can manage if desperate for Indian food. Price is a bit on the higher side though
4
Place is Nice..
Service Staffs are also Nice & Alert...
Only not too good is the food... Not much choices...
5
The buffet spread was decent, could have more varieties but although decent, the quality of each spread of food was well prepared and deliciously good!
2
I think eating here is more for necessity than enjoyment - the food options for breakfast were rather bland. Not the best way to start the day!
4
Food was good with good ambience. Service was prompt and staff very polite. Good place for gatherings.
4
Although the dinning area is small, there was a variety of delicious food. There was no staff to welcome their customers. Even to obtain their assistance.
4
The food is fresh and always there and the ambience is nice..the choice is splendid...don't take too much of food at one time as you will have sooooo many choice later
3
Nice ambience. Staff very attentive and polite. But the food choices are quite limited. I went there last Friday, 18. And main dish was just plain rice and pasta. With only a few other side dishes. And took a look at other guest plate, they either pick rice or pasta. Will definitely come again if they wisen the food range durinf Lunch time
2
3 months ago, delicious roasted beef and stew were available for the lunch buffet. None of that were available recently. Mutton stew was tasteless. Baked fish finished mid way in lunch service, no top-up. Fresh prawns were overly salted for whatever reason, maybe to give impression there were from deep sea. Fruits not fresh. Juice from morning. Dirty cutlery. Rude kitchen staff
5
Booked this via online reservation (www.chope.co). Upon arrival, we were ushered to our seats quickly and ready to start our buffet! It was a Friday, and their themed buffet was mexican, wasn't really my ideal buffet theme but I'd still enjoyed it though. The staff is very attentive although I felt they were pretty overloaded (need more manpower!). Requested for a birthday cake and they did not disappoint. I would still come back for another buffet but not for Mexican food. Otherwise, well recommended! Very well maintained restaurant. Keep it up
4
My boyfriend and I had the SG50 buffet. I love the concept of the restaurant. The roasted beef was awesome. There are cold dishes, sushi, chocolate fountain and many more local dishes. The only downside is that plain water will be served, thus, we had to wait and get the waiter/waitresses attention before we got our glasses filled up. And in order to order the special pasta and laksa, it was not organized as we had to stand and wait at the area, blocking other diners from the buffet spread. Should have table numbers (sth like sakura concept) and we can just peg down our orders. Other than that, food have good quality. Looking forward to the themed buffets
5
My breaking of fast was made pleasant and hassle free with the availability of prayer room & good food.
3
Food varieties are limited though acceptable but great place to catch up with old friends. Clean sleek fresh atmosphere. Not very convenient for public transportation. Just maybe should have other meat apart from beef. Mutton etc... But for a halal food. overall not bad.
3
Was difficult to find veg dishes on the menu.
We ordered a dish which we did not like at all
The staff is very courteous
2
Nothing to brag about, on their website it says they served Mediterranean and local food but I don't see anything that would fall into Mediterranean food.
3
I made a reservation at 21 on Rajah for my boss' birthday on 2 July at 7pm. When we arrived, there was no one at the front counter to usher us in, and we waited for more than 5 minutes. So I had to go in and find a staff (they were not visible so it took me a while to search for one of them) and let them know of our reservation and our seat.Other than that, the food was very good. Hope the staffs there are more attentive to customers and please, always have someone to be at the counter. I also noticed that the staffs like to congregate at one place (especially near the sushi area) and chit-chat. Makes it uncomfortable for customers to walk around them in order to get the food
2
Made a reservation thru Chope. Reach the place on 15min before time. Was shocked, because my name is not in the reservation list. And guess what, the place is full with people cause it's fasting month and many came for break fast. Had to wait aside while they check for any empty table. None, so they carry a table instead and place it in the middle of a empty space. Not gonna complain on the food...just not happy with the reservation mode thru Chope. Is it automatic or what
2
overall just not happy, I have to stand up walk to the counter ask for water, spoon sugar clear the plate, whatever i need for my table, or service. I have to go get them myself. I think this is really Buffet, you go get your own food and utensils. hahahaha... Cheers 
4
The food quality was great. Had the sirloin steak, tortellini and alot more food. The quality was great even though the spread not too many. Place was crowded and ran out of some cutleries so eating dessert was a bit difficult. But nonetheless place was good. For muslims there is a prayer room set for you but you have to bring your own prayer shawl.
3
This place is definitely value for money if you're a big meat, seafood eater. Even though it says vegetarian friendly, it is only slim pickings. I didn't eat much.That being said a few other areas could use some improvement.- Certain food was hard and stale because it was left out in the cold - DIY rojak station, the waffles for dessert- Thai salad was sour again because left out in the cold- Ice cream machine wasn't working- The bread was col
3
my family enjoyed our dinner buffet here but sadly, i requested a small birthday cake surprise for my husband when they called a day before for confirmation but nothing, no surprise cake for him on the day. was told that there was no request from me. :
4
I came w a party if 10. the host was patient with my questions about the reservation time change. Staff were polite and attentive.
3
The staff is not cheerful, they are polite but they have no smiles. Food choice is only fair for the price they charge.
4
Nice ambiance, good food but not too much of variety..
suits the price. Will definitely come back for more.
Don't expect a lot with the amount you're paying for.
1
Paid abt $46 after dbs discount but its not worth it.. so little food and the food area is small.. not many choices of food.. paid a little bit more and you can get carousel which is way more better!
5
The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The place is very relaxing and suitable for family with kids.
4
Great ambience and quality food. Serves Mediterranean cuisine and Asian dishes. Loves their Angus roasted beef and seafood. Reasonably good spread. Staffs are friendly and helpful.
To get there by train, Novena MRT Station
21 on Rajah at Days Hotel, 1 Balestair Rd

Visited on 10May for Mothers Day dinner.Two waitresses in particular are not friendly at all. One cant even say "can I clear the plates?". She practically point and expect me to guess what she wants to do. Poor service. Another, simply clear all cutleries and plates and came back with a bottle to spray the table and clean it while we are still sitting. But we are still there to eat. What is she thinking? One waiter just took away a plate in one motion and walk off. If other diners have glowing reviews, maybe I had the those from the bottom of the barrel. So disppointing. And to think that this was my 4th visit to the restaurant
5
Good value for money restaurant. Buffet setting at once narrow section of the restaurant will pose a challenge if the place is full. All the food are being laid out in that section with same way in and out, although I find very convenient because all are close together, but cannot imagine when more people are eating there.During my visit, 2 people choose to exchange pleasantries (chit chat) in the middle of the food aisle and this is already blocking the pathway.During my visit there were less than 20 people dining, so place is not crowded
4
After arriving from New Zealand late on Tuesday evening it was great to get up on Wednesday morning and go down to 21 on Rajah for a really hearty breakfast. It was a little more than we would normally expect to pay for a breakfast but both the quantity and quality were excellent. Only problem really was that it was so good that there were a really large number of people partaking
4
Visited on 21st March 2015 with my family. I wasn't expecting much as a friend had warned earlier about the size of the spread. However, I was still surprised when I saw it. Ambience is good and the servers are quite attentive. There are some hits and misses on the food. Wished the soft serve was available in other flavours (there was only vanilla). Also wished there were more choices for coffee (oh, it was bitter-strong)
2
The dining area not as posh as Carousel or One Market or Straits Kitchen.
The main let down was the spread of buffet..
just so meagre...it was a major set back. The management need to improve on this immediately.
3
The food was good. Not much of variety though. But overall the food/desserts especially the bread butter pudding was definitely yummy.
4
This is my 4th visit to this restaurant. Beside than reasonable price...is near to my office. Goods spread of food. Thank you
2
Their buffet spread was limited, with not much variety. For the price of $43 ++, they should serve more variety in their sushi, dessert, fruits and main station.
5
It's my 2nd time. First time enjoyed the food and ambience. 2nd time, it was rather noisy with a large group having their company's lucky draw after their dinner. But will surely come back again.
4
Went for the the ala carte dinner recently im a weekday night. The food took a bit long to get served but we were informed before hand that it might take some time. The waitress did assure us that she'll send out appetizers first. Service was good! The place wasn't packed and the food was delicious! Love their concotions of drinks too. Food may seem pricey but it is worth it
3
Though reasonable price..... but disappointed with the spreads. Maybe we went on the day where there aren't many dishes or spectacular dishes.We had a slice of meat, some local desserts and hokkien mee?? To me its more like a local dishes but with limited choices. Just my opinion.
4
For sure a value-for-money buffet with good food spread. Dining area is well organized and spacious unlike other buffet places we've been before. Excellent and prompt service given by all staff. We were a tad disappointed as the soft ice-cream machine was down that day, however the chef had surprised us with a cup of ice-cream much to our delight! The manager on duty, Mr Abdillah, even went the extra mile to help us with our parking woes. We would recommend the place to families with kids as they even have a one-hour activitiy session during the buffet lunch itself.
4
The ambience was wonderful. The tables were not cluttered together, there was plenty of room to roam about. This was especially helpful since my mother was on a wheelchair. We were able to bring her about to survey the buffet. The food was delicious, although the spread was not big. So, if variety is key, this is not the place. However, in my opinion, the ambience more than made up for the small spread
4
We were a pax of 6 adults & 4 children and we ate there on Jan 18 2015 to celebrate mom's birthday,. Ate there from 1pm till 3pm. Place was half full so we had a relaxing sunday brunch. WIth a POSB, DBS or Maybank credit card, you get 10% off. We like the openness of the decor and place. We agreed for what we paid 40 per adult, the buffet spread is good. It was a mid size buffet spread and we had a good time eating the food (the food equal the money paid). We love the love egg station as we are egg eaters. The kids got to take a break by playing outside the restaurant and we can see them from the glass doors. The waiters are ok and they clear the plates in good time. All in all, another good buffet place/alternative in Singapore to dine for muslims like us. My family & I will come back to try the breakfast buffet soon :
4
Very much light and not very cosy, but high quality on food. The Clubsandwich was delicious and nicely served. Good portion for lunch.
4
Not much choices for ala carte dishes. Perhaps they wanna promote their buffet. Food is gd but service is slow despite not many diners.
4
It was convenient to make an online booking. A reminder call was given too. Food was reasonably priced for a hotel buffet. The spread is not wide, but the food is not bad. The crab claw was the best!
3
The food are tasty but there's not many choices. The dining area is quite spacious, comfortable and cosy
4
The ambience was really great. Nice place to unwind after a crazy day at work. The food taste good too. The must try would be the juicy ribeye and fresh prawns. :)
1
This would be our 1st & last time visiting this terrible place! After much hype on this new establishment, we have decided to give it a try for our group of friends gathering. Food choices are very limited - food quality is also below average! Only the cold seafood & roast beef is nice but the rest are very disappointing. How wrong can chilli (Crayfish) with fried buns ? Tasteless crayfish with horrible sauce. Tom Yum soup tasted like tomatoes soup & they also served cheap quality sushi & salmon sashimi. This is not the more horrible experience when 1 of my friend actually found himself eating a mouldy cinnamon star cookie ! After verifying the other cookies at buffet line we found some more mouldy cookies *goodness* we have unknowingly ate some mouldy cookies ! Spoke to the manager in white shirt & he insisited its "NORMAL" without even looking at the cookie & he made the comment that if I think it has problem then I should eat it. After much confrontation, he decided to call his chef & the chef confirmed the cookies are really mouldy & they claimed that these are from external vendors. What made us angry was the manager disappeared shortly & did not appear in the restaurant again. Totally not apologetic at all. There are more better buffets (halal) in Singapore for this price you are paying.
4
We went here for lunch. Food was tasty enough but selection were quite limited. For the price we pay, I think its a good deal. But for those buffet lovers who can eat a lot might not enjoy it due to limited choices.For normal eaters, this will be sufficient
3
The food was great especially the seafood, salad, and dessert sections. But it's a little bit too pricey for a buffet that doesn't have much variety of food selections as compared to some other hotel buffets. Service wise, they are excellent, helpful and are able to clear our tables fast
4
Okay i've heard a few people raving about the restaurant. So i plan to actually make a visit for my moms 54th birthday. With that said, the restaurant has lesser people on weekdays maybe due to the location. Easily found if taxi drivers knew about Days Hotel. It is situated in the hotel. The service is superb and i even got a special birthday cake for my mom. The only down side is that you can finish eating all the food provided in the third or fourth visit to the counter
4
We were the first to arrive. Was ushered to our table for six by a smiling and warm female staff. Were briefed by this staff on the location of the food set up as well as the drink stations. During our dining, the staff were constantly clearing out used utensils and were quick to response when called upon. Overall, kudos to the service staff and not forgetting the chef who send the omelette all the way to put table. Had a very pleasant dining experience there. Keep it up
4
It was a good experience over at 21 on Rajah.
The staff was nice & efficient. The food was good.
There isn't a wide spread but it is definitely value for money.
I loved the ambience.
Will definitely visit there again :)
4
This is 1 halal restaurant which i truly enjoyed myself with my Muslim friends. Everyone enjoyed the food and the staff was kind to show them the way to prayers room. The food is fresh and top up promptly. Variety is good too.
5
excellent food on the buffet especially the fresh seafood. Staff very helpful and view from glass windows nice
4
Came during lunch. The food is nice but not much variety. Would be good if they have sashimi during lunch. Fruits and desserts not many choices.

Your Review
Not helpful or friendly when requesting for assistance ..
Eg..i ask politely 4 baby chair from 2 staffs..but no baby chair a result nor i get a reply from these 2 staffs
3
Love the space: family-friendly! Tip-top service. Spread is decent, could do with a wider selection.
2
1. The call taker for 21 on Rajah should be proactive enough in promoting promotions such as book via Chope 25% off, various credit cards 15% off. I believed it is not that difficult enough in taking the initiative to make these information known to the potential customers.2. Not much variety. We were expecting varieties Mediterranean food. That will definitely make this 21 on Rajah stands out from the rest.3. Given the pricing, we can get way better choices of food elsewhere
5
Being a Muslim in Singapore, we have limited restaurants that serve Halal International buffet. Learned about 21 on Rajah from friend's facebook and decided to give it a try on my daughter's birthday. Our family of four were very pleased with the food and their variety. The cold seafood such as prawn, scallop, lobster, muscle, etc were very fresh. My daughter received a small complimentary birthday cake after our meal. For a price of $40++ per person, it is one of the cheapest international buffet lunch you can get in Singapore for hotel standard. There is also a private function room for group or special occasion. The hotel also provide prayer room for their Muslim customers to fulfill their religious obligation. We will sure return to have more meals here with our friends and relatives
2
Went there for dinner on Tuesday night with office colleagues. I had quite high expectations after reading the positive reviews on various websites. Let me start with the positives first:- Nice restaurant with equally nice ambiance- Roast beef was good albeit a bit dry- Prawns on ice was freshNegatives:- The buffet spread was pathetically small and limited. After only 2 rounds, I have to repeat the same food again.- The food was rather blandOverall experience was rather disappointing, considering that I had rather high expectations. However, I have to note that the price we paid was considerably lower than Carousel
3
Went for Brunch on a Saturday. Open for breakfast all the way to 3pm. The brunch spread was small, definitely. I have to be honest and say that I was definitely a little dissapointed at the spread. However, their specials were definitely great! Their roasted Ribeye and Laksa was to die for. The staff was definitely very attentive to all our needs.
4
I like the food at this hotel, price very reasonable and at dinner time, you can also enjoy the sushi/sashimi as well as the special ice sticks at dessert :) I like 'Yam' flavour ice sticks....so good.
4
21 on Rajah has average food. The breakfast was good but lunch was not that good. I would never recommend it.
4
Great food. Mediterranean Buffet style and lots of delicious taste! Would have liked to have a glass of wine with meal, but no alcohol served.
4
We went out of curiosity as it is opposite our hotel and a walk through the park. The concept is interesting and the price is very reasonable. The location and the view is nice.
5
I went to 21on Rajah for a lunch buffet with 11members of my family. We were quite surprised with the wide range of food selections. The seafood counter and the dessert counter are our favourites with each person making several trips to these counters. Even though we have been dining at 5stars hotel restaurant like Aquamarines (more than 5 times)we think that 21on Rajah are value for money given the wide selection of food they have. But don't expect Aquamarines service cause we had our plates stacked up high before service staffs came to clear them. My whole family are really satisfied with 21 on Rajah and definitely we will come back again.

Basically my negative comment are mostly focused on their food. The food variety is limited and is placed in a very narrow banquet lining... What was made worst is that it takes a long time for the food to be replenish and its even worst when the variety of food are small. Furthermore, their laksa is mend by a China lady which has difficulty to understanding simple english.... Imagine the frustration... However there are glimpse of hope for the restaurant. The waiters are very efficient and is swift to dispose all the used plates on our table. Not only that, they even make small conversation with us to lighten the mood. Lastly, they even assisted our family on our Mom's Surprise Birthday Dinner

I came here on Saturday for my mum's bday celebration.. The staff told me that they could send the cake for her. Upon arriving, the staff told me I need to inform them if I want them to send the cake. And I did but they took so long just to send the cake.. Instead, they sent the cake to other people. It pisses me off because I requested first yet they send to other gst and told me they had a round up of cakes. Then what's the point of requesting for it to be sent in the first place?spoiled the surprise terribly.

Food and drinks were really appealing, they were prepared perfectly and tasted really good. And the desserts mmmmm superb. ^^. The price's very reasonable, it's a good value. The service was fast. The restaurant attendants were attentive in taking our orders, exhibited good customer service, treated us wonderfully, with warmth and generosity. You won't be disappointed. We'll definitely come back

Definitely a good place to dine. The buffet breakfast was very good with an decent spread. I also had lunch at this place and I thought it was quite good. I was also surprised by the extremely courteous nature of some of the staff at the restaurant. Although I was disappointed that the restaurant closes early in the night (before 10 PM)

Advertised as "communal dining", there is, indeed, an atmosphere of picnic tables.Dishes at dinner are elegant, and nourishing, but dinner as a whole is not an experience you want to come back to. Breakfast is not as streamlined as it must be.In my opinion, there is a staff problem that will take some solving. Division of labor is non-existent, all of them do all the jobs that need to be done, a lot less than well. After you have gesticulated for a while to get someone's attention, you are apt to be served half a cup of coffee, and asked "is this enough?". No thought is given to the temperature of the last drops of coffee in a decanter that has been idle for a long time. Mix-ups between coffee and tea are frequent enough to be observed once a day. Missing cutlery is never corrected unless asked for. A server (for lack of a better word) is apt to set a table for 4, but only put down 2 cups, before being diverted to something entirely different.Lids on hot food containers are broken, and seem to have been so for quite a while
