Stall opens almost everyday in a year except CNY. Whether there is queue or not, they serve fast. Love their yam cake. If you having a party, you can pre-order them which comes in aluminium foil tray. They serve economic noodle with add on ingredients, still a decent meal that will fill you stomach
