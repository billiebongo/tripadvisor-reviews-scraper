Caesar Salad, Pizza, Iced Tea, Relaxed Outside Dining and Friendly Service next to the waterway. What is there not to like about that!

Very quiet when we went so there was no atmosphere. I'd be happy to come back another time at the end of the day to try it out again.

We just walked across from our hotel. The food was tasty and the beer and wine very nice. Service was friendly and professional.
There was a relaxed atmosphere that encourages conversation and meeting new people.

Fish and chips and burger was far below par. Was the chef there? Service and atmosphere very fine though

Ordered the sweet and sour special which was excellent. Location is right on the river and the beer is cheap. Made a great choice and thoroughly recommend.

Walked the length of Robertson's Quay before choosing the Quay helpful friendly staff, visited three times during our stay great service and when asked the Chef happily varied the ingredients in the sweet & sour to suit my Wife's dietary needs. Great cold pint of Tiger,very welcome on a Singapore evening! , hope to visit Singapore again and I know where we will be eating - The Qua

I wanted to go to the Aussie bar Boomerang to watch the tennis final between Federer and Nadal but there we no table left so ended up walking thru Robinson Quay and managed to see a TV showing tennis inside this restaurant. Good value with $10 pints of beer. It was pretty empty inside when we arrived late afternoon but at least we got a super seat in front of the TV, but as the final turned into a 5 setter the atmosphere grew with more people arriving. The decor inside was awful for a place situated in such a great environment by the river at Robinson Quay.We don't eat except a plate of nachos which was average straight from the supermarket, but I asked for extra guacamole which they didn't charge me extra for. Coming from Europe one thing I hate is not filling up my pint to the top - even worse a waiter taking my glass and I still have beer left - this happened twice to me on Saturday and I let both of them know what I thought!!Any way all in all a good afternoon out - Federer won in an exciting 5 setter, the beer was cold and I had plenty of them and the Quay kitchen provided a TV with the game on Fox sports!

We have visited the Quay on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is excellent as are the friendly staff. Service is swift and the food is excellent. I would highly recommend the Singapore Laksa or one of the platters t share if you are not as hungry.A great place to do a little people watching

Love this place. With its friendly service and great (and very cheap) beer it is my place of choice. The menu is mixed with Asian and western and the food quality always good. This is my go to place in the area for a quick bite to eat or a good place to meet friends.
