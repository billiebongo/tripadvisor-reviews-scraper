Good place for afterwork gatherings amongst friends. Good selection of wine at decent prices. Food platters are good for sharing. Friendly service.

The oyster night was a good chance to get fresh and good-priced oysters. The beers and sparkling wine at happy hours were also quite enjoyable.
3
Affordable food with a value for money wine. Good wine recommendation and service provided from the waitress.

We ordered oysters during happy hour - what a surprise, the HH oysters were fresh, juicy, creamy and was $2 each! House wine and meat platter were all very decent. Will go back.

Ok, nothing special. Oysters were well priced but, for us, lacked atmosphere and the food was hit and miss

I am a regular here - depending on which day you come (Tuesdays and Fridays are always great), there are great promotions - $2 oysters that are decent, $5 wines or beers. A must try is the Kofta, and amazing Pork Knuckle. The place has a unique charm, nestled in Keong Saik Road, you'll soon find yourself coming back here very often

After late lunch/dinner in Chinatown we wanted somewhere to have a few unwind drinks. This little wine bar bistro is about a 10 minute walk from where we had just eaten in Chinatown.It is part of a chain of around 4 bars in different locations.Good selection of wines and beers but limited on cocktails. Large table for nine people was no problem, prices were reasonable and music was not too loud, pleasant way to end a late lunch

$5 for selected beer and house pour, what more can you ask for The oyster is one order that you cannot pass on! 1 dozen for $24 They are fresh and creamy, baked ones are perfect too!Nice environment for gathering that is not too noisy that you have to shout at each other Remember to make a reservation for your visit plus your oysters too to avoid disappointment

This is our second time to this Bistro. We missed the special tapas promotion because we came after 9pm, but we decided to have a try with some of their other dishes. We are glad we did. The food is absolutely awesome and good portions. We also had a bottle of wine for $48, which is very good for Singapore.The photos show the dishes, but would like to mention the grilled salmon and the pasta al oleo

Dinner for 11 (8A + 3C) at Wine Mansion. Hint: Make a reservation for the "elevated seating" table. You will be seated just next to the kitchen. The food and service is hard to beat. The kitchen is unbelievably small, and is manned by two guys. Yet food arrives without delay. Those two guys deserve a medal. Dishes to order: Mixed Kebab Platter, Pork Knuckles, Shashukah, Baked Brussel Sprouts, Parmesan Garlic Fries, Salads (a little over dressed), Mushroom (sides @ $5), Turkish pide (sides @ $5)For Dessert: Lava cake (Sinful), Sundae Mess (Absolutely sinful). The house wines at $5 a glass are well worth it, and so are the beer buckets at $40.We were there at 6pm and left at about 21:00 on a Saturday nite. Atmosphere was just right. I expect that that it would get noisier later on a Saturday night. We had a great time at a very cool chill out place

What a nice find! Great wine selection and happened to be there on special tapas Thursday. I had the garlic roasted broccoli, the mushrooms, the pasta with duck and the kofta. The food was splendid and not too expensive.
4
Enjoyed a couple of quiet glasses of wine in this bar with chilled music and good service. Good variety of wines by the bottle, less variety of wines by the glass. Also sells beers and spirits.

The best lamb I've had in 2 yrs in Singapore! I had the pita and my friends both had the kebabs. Fresh delicious food. Highly recommended. Very well priced - great value for such a nice meal.
5
We had the koftas and seafood choppino and both were great. There's $2 oysters on Tuesday, but they were not cleanly shucked and of average quality, so I wouldn't go back again for the oysters. Might return on a Thursday for the tapas special..
5
We went there twice and both experiences were great. We tried the daily special -tapas night and the SGD5 dollar happy hour night. Food were nice and the services were excellent. The uncle there was especially attentive and helpful. We ordered a lot but the bill was rather affordable, thanks a lot to the 5 dollar house wine deal! They have different themes / deals every day so worth trying out on different days (e.g., tapas night, oyster night, lady's night, and 5 dollar wine night etc).I will definitely come back! No better place to chill on a Friday night !

I had lunch here this week, which I can highly recommend. The limited lunch menu has very affordable options, which is good. All the wines on display tempted me to go back after work for a single after-work drink. Unfortunately, the only option by the glass is a not very attractive Chilean wine (true for both the red and white wine); the humous and baba ganoush a bit bland, and the bread for the dip got hard before I finished the glass of wine. Atmosphere really nice - but you have to go for a whole bottle of wine if you want something palatable. Keong Saik road in general is great for bar hopping, though. Cheaper than the more central night life in Chinatown

Our family ate here twice - lunch and a dinner. What a pleasant surprise. Portions were large and prices not unreasonable. Wine list extensive, but wine is dear in Singapore. Look out for daily specials that will give you the extra value. Western food with tapas etc.

We visited this restaurant for dinner. Restaurant is a bit small. We had the salad team plate and the duck confit for starters. The salad team plate was okay, nothing special. The hummus that came with the salad team plate was not too bad and the rest of the items were just cherry tomatoes with some cucumbers. The duck confit with fries were tasty! For the mains, we had the beef kebab with olive rice which was decent and the salmon fillet which was very fresh. Wine is also cheap here

Came here for dinner and drinks this week with a friend. We tried the kebabs and the salmon ceviche, both of which were quite decent. Good selection of wine at reasonable prices and water is brought out without even having to ask. Friendly service and a good atmosphere. Worth a visit for sure

It seems like most people were here for their alcohol buffet ($35++) but we were here mainly for dinner. The kebabs we had were amazing, and the pasta was pretty good as well. We used the Entertainer app for 1-for-1 on main courses, saving us enough to buy a bottle of wine at the end of the dinner. Overall a great experience with wonderful food and attentive staff
