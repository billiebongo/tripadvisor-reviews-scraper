A beautiful rooftop for a Friday night after work chill. Also looks like a great event space. Just be aware though if it rains theres not much of a shelter.

Even though it's a bit pricey, I would say the bar is more of a special occasion place rather than your usual watering hole.

We were staying in the hotel below so decided to check this place out for some food as we didn't fancy going too far. The food when it arrived was amazing I would say the best I had in Singapore, we both ordered the mushroom pasta which was creamy without being too sickly, the only downside was the rather long wait on the food coming but that could be because they were busy downstairs. The bar had a good selection of drinks both local and international. The final bill was high but worth it, the portion sizes were good and nothing else was needed. Def would go back if ever in Singapore again

View from the roof top is nice but nothing compared to what you can get at roof top places along Boat Quay. Having said that it was spoilt by the bad service. Food wise, it was decent except that food service was slow, real slow. The best dish we had was the beef which was very well prepared.

The food served here is not just bad, but embarrassingly so, and the prices are a ripoff.Ordered 5 "small plates" here and they can be reviewed as follows:"Famous Truffle Fries" - these were a disgrace - not "fries" but rather those flat rectangle potatoe chips you buy for a dollar a KG at a discount supermarket to reheat in your oven. The only two other times these have been served to me were at my school canteen and at a kabab shop at 2am after a night out. Lightest dusting of Parmesan and truffle oil ever so only the top few had any taste - the rest were poor tasting potatoes. They charge 15sgd for a small portion which is the same PS Cafe charges for a huge helping of actual fries practically swimming in truffle oil and cheese. Borderline theft.Potatoe croquettes - tasteless and small, I'm guessing straight from the freezer.Rice balls - ok at best, fairly tasteless.Meatballs - the best part of the meal but worse than pretty much every other meatball I've been served in Singapore - again average at best.Bruschetta - wow, how they managed to screw this one up I don't know. This is so simple to do, just chop tomatoes finely, add finely chopped onions, garlic and basil and drizzle with olive oil. What we received were mushed tomatoes with a single basil leave on the plate. Because the tomatoes were mushed not chopped the bread went soggy and fell apart as we picked it up. Actually tasted bad so we didn't even finish.To top it off they are on the entertainer which advertises buy two get two free tapas of "equal or lesser value" - every single tapas place bar none in singapore we've visited simply takes the cheapest two tapas off the bill. Here apparently you have to order two of the same tapas to get this discount which meant we had to pay full price for the above mess of food. It would have been hugely overpriced at the discounted rate let alone the full price.Given they are no financially better off making you get the same dishes I can only presume the reason for this rule is to trick people coming here with the entertainer only to fraud them into not being able to use it.The icing on the cake was Christmas songs still being played in mid-January - avoid at all costs

Came here last week for a drink with a friend after work. First time at this place: quite a nice rooftop bar with a bit of a view of the surrounding area. Decent selection of cocktails and friendly service. Not too many people here early in the evening. Worth another visit

We had a very nice meal here consisting of the burrito (fantastic), lobster pasta, ribeye, and lemon tart. All were prepared very well. The staff is friendly and the setting is very nice. One tip to the venue would be to adjust the music to be a little more authentic and chilled out

First of all I chose this restaurant because it was on entertainer and I had been told there were good views. When I went (group of 7), I was sat at a location which didn't have the CBD view. I was also informed that the Entertainer offers could not be used with the one for one tapas offer. When I clarified with the server (whose spoken English wasn't very good) as to whether there are any special credit card requirements for the one for one tapas, we were informed no. So we went ahead and ordered 3 tapas (wanted to set aside the other complimentary 3 for later), but think the server misunderstood and brought us 6 tapas. So fine, we didn't complain cos the food had already been served. Then when we asked for the bill, we were told that we had to have an HSBC card for the tapas promotion. The entire table had heard with our own ears, otherwise. The manager came and we explained the situation, only to be told rudely that we "had already eaten the food so there's nothing she can do". No compensation or even a discount, or voucher for future visits. Terrible and I won't be back. I probably wouldn't have been so mad if the food was great. But it wasn't. I paid $35 for 1/2 serving of truffle fries and 4 pieces of tapas (1 serving of tapas had 3 pcs). SO NOT WORTH THE EXORBITANT PRICE. AND I COULD HAVE USED ENTERTAINER. The views weren't even that good, you can find similar views at many other bars around the city. Won't be coming back or recommending this place to any other friends

A friend was staying at The Scarlett and so we popped up to Aria for a drink after dinner. As is often the case in Singapore, the wine wasn't cheap but it was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed my Italian pinot grigio as my friends did their red wine. It was nice to sit up on the roof top at night and a great change from being inside

We came here with friends for dinner on a Friday night. I really like the rooftop setting and general vibe. We tried all the starters and the burrata was excellent, best I've had in Singapore. The other starters were ok. We ordered the rib eye and branzino which were both mediocre. Then we ordered a desert which took 45 minutes to come and was totally disappointing. The service was mediocre, pouring the wine and spilling drops everywhere, was just a bit rough. I would maybe come back for a drink because the ambiance is nice. But not for food

It was a great bar with friendly staff, atmosphere great drinks ! Good for a chill night out ugh friends

Really pretty roof top bar with pergolas and views over Singapore. Drinks were good especially the non alcoholic watermelon juice, very refreshing & rehydrating.

It's good place to go on a date.
The food was fit with atmosphere.
The staff was very friendly, we had a nice time.

Went to meet some friends one evening at Aria, which is a lovely rooftop bar at one of my favorite boutique hotels. The venue is perfect for an evening get-together: really nice chilled vibe with its own romantic rooftop view of Singapore. Drinks were high quality including the signature mocktails/cocktails the staff recommended. We also went there to have some evening desserts... these were also were fantastic. Would highly recommend this place and try to schedule a visit for when the live music is on

We are here the third time in a week and happy. Whatever we wish for: drinks, good wine, a meal - everything is great. Alessandro and his team ate great, offering us a quiet home in middle of busy SingaporeThe burrata - the best ever. Huge and heavenly seasoned; the Milanese an authentic Italian dream; not soeaking of rhe incredible Zabaione - the way my grandma used to do itWe cannot understand the negative votations on tripadvisor. Everyone is doing an excellent job, fullfulling every possible wishWe highly recommend this small culinary paradis

We made a booking but no table ready (we were on time). The food seemed to come straight from the freezer to the table via the microwave. Wine List is limited and the guy who served it just plonked the bottle on the table...no ice bucket, no serving. Service was slow slow slow. Only good thing about the place was Alex, an Italian staff member who turned up towards the end to inject a decent service. I'd avoid the place until they get their act together (and maybe get a new chef)Go elsewhere..

Just finished dinner at Da Paolo in club street and inspired by The Entertainer app we went to this place. Buy 2 cocktails get 2 free so we ordered cocktails. All cocktails are very unique, a bit too unique tastes and both my friend and I could not appreciate. We tried 2 different ones but not really good.Nice place on rooftop though so that was positive. Might try one more time and go for beer or wine instead. So unless you like adventurous tasting cocktails, I suggest you do the same when visiting this place

Great Pre-dinner bar with stunning setting. Bar bites are available and service is fantastic. Yes, you can also smoke here

Went here with friends and after waiting for rather a long time, I had to go in search of a waiter. They were having a function later, but surely that shouldn't be at the expense of guests who need a g and t after a busy day in the city

Friendly staff and great service. Italian cuisine is excellent. Restaurant and cafe rival any big name restaurant in singapore.

I had a small gathering here. The location is lovely. My only complaint is that the nibbles I order to accompany my guest's drinks took 45 minutes to arrive. The food finally arrived as we were preparing to leave.

This little discreet rooftop restaurant bar above the Scarlet Hotel is even lovelier after its make-over.
3
After ordering, the food took more than 20 minutes to be served each time. Other than that, it was good.

We had beer and cocktails sitting on the terrace , the warm breeze gently caressing our faces and making the tea lights dance ,.........it was actually pretty bloody romantic , we didn't try the food but the menu looked good , serving Sicilian dishes .

Great for a casual night out. Cocktails are delicious and they even grow their herbs in a small garden on the roof!

As a couple, we found Aria by chance while walking around Club Street and looking for an Italian restaurant where we could get our 'date night' quietly.We had a look at the roof top and were instantly amazed by the clear view and the charming atmosphere. The staff was helpful, the food and drinks were reasonably priced given the location and the luxury of the hotel underneath the roof top.I strongly advice it the next time you went to spend a nice and quiet moment with your second half

Tucked away just yards from the hustle of Club St, the Scarlet hotel has a rooftop bar with a wonderful outlook. Staff are accommodating, but on occasion hard to find, and the drink selection is reasonable if expensive. Smoking area a welcome addition in Singapore, but not intrusive for other guests. A good spot.

Aria is a beautiful rooftop bar with wonderful staff & delicious food and cocktails. It is a great space for events, date night or a girls night out! My favorite menu item is the lemon tart, made with lemons grown in house! While sitting at Aria you can enjoy a wider spread of food from Casa Tartufo, the sister restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel which specializes in truffle dishes.

My wife and daughter visited this very attractive rooftop bar and reported sitting as the sun went down, enjoying the view and the gentle breeze. Two glasses of wine cost S$28 ++. Disappointingly, and not in common with most places in Singapore, water is not available unless is it paid for. No complimentary 'nibbles' were served. Despite these downsides another visit is planned as the general ambiance deserves another try

This roof bar is extremely nice and stylish. Offering quality drinks and spanish / italian type small snacks (tapas) in addition of nice selection of cocktails, drinks and artisan beer. Top notch atmosphere and highly attentive customer service. Highly recommened
