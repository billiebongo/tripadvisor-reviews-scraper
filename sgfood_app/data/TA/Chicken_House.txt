This is my third time coming back to Chicken House. It is my personal favourite for chicken rice as I do not like the fatty kind. You need to try it to see it.The bean sprout is my favourite veg here as it tastes relatively healthy.The only downside is that it's really difficult to find parking in the neighbourhood. Don't come at closing time as they might run out of chicken

Fabulous kampung chicken!! Succulent and tender meat, and neither too little or too much oil, and great chilli that goes along with the Hainanese rice!My favorite way to eat Hainanese Chicken rice is always to mix and stir the chilli into the rice (get the right chilli sauce, not the garlicky mix), and have an even balance of chilli-up rice and meat in every spoonful. The magic of a great Hainanese Chicken Rice meal is not just in the chicken, but also in the The fragrance of the rice. The rice here is delicious, without being too oily. Also, the skin on the chicken adds to the overall taste and texture, without being overwhelming at all. Finally, I checked out this more quiet (currently) place today instead of the more famous restaurants across the road, because those have been getting somewhat disappointing after becoming too commercialized. No regrets!

Chicken house supposed to be of the top 10s most famous restaurant for Hainanese Chicken Rice in town but to him it is just average. But I was not disappointed.The signatory Hainanese chicken rice is readily served. The free range chicken is absolutely tasty, tender and juicy even for the chicken breast. It is indeed very reasonably priced. Although the restaurant's location was out of the way, it didn't stopped regulars from making their way there. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. A very enjoyable lunch experience

Was taken here by my mother in law, who claimed it was the best chicken rice in Singapore.This simple restaurant belies the delicious food inside, plain tables and chairs and a ceiling fan. It's a wonderfully unpretentious, uncluttered and genuine place to eat.The warm, yellow fleshed organic chicken was served dressed in a light soy dressing on a bed of cucumber. The flavoured rice was delicious, the chicken accompanied by two sauces; a green ginger and a red chilli. We also had a side dish of green vegetables.The chicken was tender and full of flavour, the rice and sauces a perfect accompaniment. The hot green veg was also delicious.Highly recommended.

The traditional Hainanese chicken rice is a well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (文昌雞) which was adopted by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in Southeast Asia. Over time, it evolves itself into various versions of chicken rice of which Hainanese chicken rice is still the most popular. In Singapore, Hainanese chicken rice is served everywhere from school tuck-shops, hawker stalls, food courts to major restaurants and even on board commercial planes. There are popular Hainanese chicken rice stalls that include Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Five Star, Boon Tong Kee, Loy Kee, Wee Nam Kee, Yeo Keng Nam and many others island wide.Among all these eating places, there is one non air-conditioned restaurant called Kampong Chicken Rice at Chicken House located at 255A Upper Thomson Road along a row of shop houses next to an UOB bank. My wife, domestic helper and I were at the restaurant on 16 August 2015, which was a Sunday. We ordered a plate of half steamed chicken ($12.00), a plate of chicken gizzard and liver ($3.00), a plate of Kai Lan in oyster sauce ($4.00), four plates of chicken rice ($0.60 per plate), and two glasses of warm bailey water ($1.30 per glass). However, we didn’t order their signature crab because we don’t like to eat crab. The whole excellent meal was of decent price of $25.65 inclusive of 7% GST.The poached chicken was neatly chopped and placed over a garnish of sliced cucumbers and sprigged over with fresh coriander in a big plate. The small plate of delicious and tender chicken gizzard and liver was served along with the main course of tender, smooth, juicy and tasty chicken meat. Each plate of warm, fragrant and delectable chicken rice was served with a small bowl of plain and scrumptious hot chicken broth containing soft boiled cabbage. Kai Lan in oyster sauce was moist, crunchy and appetizing. They were all authentically served with a fantastic and irresistible condiments of chilli sauce dip made up of freshly minced red chilli and garlic. The dip was accompanied with dark soy sauce and a heap of freshly pounded ginger to enhance the overall taste and aroma to their best savour. I was in love with the magnificent sauces as they complement each other perfectly. Of course not forgetting the nice home-made and thirst-quenching bailey drinks. I would say the whole meal was done to perfection in this restaurant.To me, this is a very popular Hainanese chicken rice, though they named it Kampong Chicken Rice. The kampong chickens of tropical breeds are in a leaner and tastier version especially from large scale poultry farms. Such chickens are known to be tender, juicy, tasty, low fat and in fine-skin texture. The highlight of our lunch was the kampong chicken which was succulent, tender and dexterously flavoured. It was absolutely delicious and above all, we had a fabulous meal. Though there were crowds waiting for their takeaway lunches, food was prompt and the entire experience was hassle-free. The beautifully steamed kampong chicken and its tantalising chicken rice make the drive out to the Chicken House at Upper Thomson Road worthwhile

One of the best chicken rice I had in Singapore. The chicken meat is firm but not rough, meat is juicy. This goes well with the rice and of course the chilli sauce.Typically people come order at least 1/2 chicken or whole chicken. Kampung chicken is slightly smaller so 2 person can finish 1/2 chicken. Weekends and dinner time is crowded. Car park is an issue and usually I park along the road behind the restaurant
