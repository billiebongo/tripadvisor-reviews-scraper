The kaya toast wasnâ€™t spectacular. Was rather average. Also the coffee brew is not as good.
The place was clean nonetheless and eggs were made well.

This was the closest MRT station to our hotel, so obviously we were here everyday. Very cool place. Nice choices of fast foods. Some are not familiar with us, unique for Singapore (may be), however, there are lots of things that anybody can have.

We did a quick stop here when we were on our way shopping. It's a new cool idea that we haven't seen before.

Good place for a quick bite on the go. Appetizing selections to choose from. Need more of these around Singapore.
