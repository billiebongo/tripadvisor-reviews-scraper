I do a lot of canoeing and we finish late morning/early pm on Sat and Sun. I come here for Chicken Rice after every weekend session. Simple, reasonably healthy and just fantastic

We made it into this restaurant just before closing time and glad we did!
Their wanton noodle soup was delicious, just as I expected.
For a quick meal for two people , we paid a reasonable $8.
I would definitely go back there again.

One of my must eats while recently traveling to Singapore was to have some delicious Chicken rice. One of my colleagues kindly accepted my request, and promptly took me to The Chicken Rise Ex-Press.I was not disappointed! We, of course, had the Chicken rice, as well as wonton noodle soup and vegetables. Everything was full of flavour, salty, oily and delicious. We washed everything down with some very refreshing calamansi juice, yum!I was very happy to tick of Chicken rice off my must eats wish lists while back in SG! Worth a try

It's the Singaporean national dish and it's great. This place was right across the road from our apartment it's cheap for the Set chicken, rice, soup, vegetables and a drink it's just $6.50 thats quite expensive by Singaporean standards but we thought it was great value. I can see why many Singaporeans don't cook at home there is just no need with some much great food around. We ate many time during our stay

Authentic, complete and well priced. The Chicken Rice set consists of the chicken and chicken flavoured rice, a plate of Chinese vegetable, clear soup (chicken, of course) and a lime or barley drink. You may ask for the wing or thigh sections. There is more on offer at this eating place beside chicken rice. Try the "char siew" rice, roasted pork rice or chicken curry noodles

Each and every time coming here is always precisely what you expect! The food always taste the same as well as the portion. Ambiance is typical Chinese restaurant but it's super clean -- I must say.Service? Please read the restaurant name "The Chicken Rice Ex-Press" means "No SERVICE". So don't expect one, please go somewhere for this needs to anyone who expect to be served!Food price tagged from SGD 0.8 - 10/meal/person.Recommended

I come to this place for lunch sometimes with my colleagues. While the food is so-so, normal chicken rice you can find anywhere else, the service is horrendous.While having lunch, you will have a 8 out of 10 chance of being interrupted by the lady (she's like the matriarch figure there) asking if you still want the chili sauce. Sometimes they will shift guests from the section behind so that they can close that section off before 2pm.If you want a peaceful lunch, I'd suggest you find somewhere else, lest getting irritated, either by the staff, or by the customers having a commotion with the staff

This restaurant serves the best hainanese chicken in Singapore. My children kept coming back here every time we are in singapore just to order their hainese chicken. But you should also try their other dishes because they also taste very delicious. Their prices are also very reasonable. I highly recommend this place

We went to this place for late lunch today. We ordered chicken for 2 person, 2 rice, 2 lemon juice and wonton mee with red pork. The chicken was too bland and quite oily. The rice was little dried and little too hard for my liking. The wonton mee and red pork sauce was too salty. The pork was tender and noodle was firm. The lime juice taste like came out from a tank. I expected more for local restaurant but for what I have got today only food court quality level. To be honest, chicken rice and wonton mee with red pork at food junction near my home taste a bit better and I paid half there.

We had just stepped out of our hotel on Orchard street and were shopping while we came across some eateries around lunch time. We love non veg food but experimenting with it anymore was not our thing as we were tired. Seafood couldnt have gone down well with us when we just by fluke stopped at this shop. It was just another shop that looked sleek with tables set inside and outside. We wanted something very simple and saw rice on their board. The attendant suggested we go for Hainanese Chicken Rice meal as it was fit for one person. It was a great suggestion i must say. We had that. The chicken was sumptuous and the soup with it seemed to be very light on stomach. We were delighted. The lime drink that comes as part of the meal was also very refreshing. The entire meal just made us smile and we felt easy.We then ordered for this chicken curry noodles which were just fine as curries prepared with coconut dont impress me much.This is a safe bet for those who cannot eat seafood. Also, this is one must be one of the finest Chicken Rice in Singapore. Most importantly, it looks neat and hygienic.I think we paid 6 dollars for chicken rice which is a good deal
