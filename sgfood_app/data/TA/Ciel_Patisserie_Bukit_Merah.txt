We ordered delivery and the Fraiche Tart and Chocolate Almond Tart came in gorgeous packaging- a light grey box in a clear plastic bag. When we opened the box, the tarts looked beautiful. At a total of $8.80, it was very good value and less than half the price of a certain high-end tart shop in the city! In fact, each tart is about 2 to 3 dollars cheaper than most other patisseries and bakeries. The taste? Absolutely delicious! Recommended

This is the new branch that Ciel Patisserie has opened recently that is nearer the city. The look and design of the cafe has changed. Several art pieces line the wall. I am glad that the pastries offered remain of a relatively high standard. I particularly like the strawberry shortcake with its fluffiness that makes it light and enjoyable. The bombe consisting of chocolate mousse with a shiny coating is another favorite. I also like the choux which is a sort of a cream puff. They have added a new item made of white chocolate. The location is quiet and surprisingly there is a hostel next to the cafe. However, there is not enough space for a big group - I think it could comfortably accommodate about 20-25 people
