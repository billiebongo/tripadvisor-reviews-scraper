Food and service is getting from bad to worse. Not worth it to travel all the way to eat this at all.
2
After many years, standard of food went down, price went up. Service of staff turned back. Do not recommend

Unique and delicious but service is terrible.. Not sure if will be a return customer and if will recommend.

The food was ok but we visited here for dinner and noticed that some of the usual dishes we ordered have been saltier lately. Hope the management will look into improving its food standards for a healthier crowd turn out.

I was craving for authentic chinese food and It was what I got. The restaurant is about 5 min by walk from Kembangan station, the restaurant is right in the corner at changi road. you can go there by car as well, there is a parking area. Restaurant is open until very late 2Am. It is very crowded, you will probably queue but the restaurant is huge and with many tables. To order it will be easier if you speak chinese otherwise you just need to show the pictures of the different pasted on the wall. Choose between different sizes. About the food, it is very tasted, the portion is big as well what I advise is to order small portion and a lot of different kind of dishes. Order the black chicken herbal soup, bee hoon with pork liver and maybe a chili crab, and vegetables. You will enjoy and love it for sure!!!

Everyone loved this place for many years already. This restaurant never fails whenever we have family gathering. We liked thier mixed pig organs Mee Sua. Thier steam fish is always our Favourite. Texture always right never over cooked. This evening we tried thier crispy fried bee Hoon. It was tasty and the kids loved it.

Was having family dinner and the place was crowded.the service was fast and good, we ordered the salted chicken. Brinjal pork floss and the signature Mee Sua , all the dishes were rather good but the signature Mee Sua was ordinary. Overall passed and the bill came to $97 for a table of 5 and 7 dishes. Very reasonable for a family dinner . Recommended

This place will give you good and cheap dishes, but service staff badly need some training in basic F & B skills. You can also request for air-conditioning room if there is vacancy. Dishes we ordered as follows:White Bee Hoon - Very good.Crispy Fried Bee Hoon - Average and very oily.Pig Innards Mee Sua - Very goodSeafodd Mee Sua - Very GoodVegetable Omelette - Very GoodSteam Baby Squid - Terrible, very rubberyCoffee Pork Ribs - Very GoodFried Prawn Fritter - Average, more dough that prawn fillings

Pretty much enjoyed the pig organ meesua and oyster omelette. Value for money. The herbal soup is thick and fragrant and the stall is not stingy with the oysters in the omelette. However, disappointed with its herbal black chicken soup as it lacks the fragrance and is not worth the money. Am a soup lover and have definitely tasted better and more value for money soup. Nonetheless, the selection is wide and with lots of other recommended dishes.

We went to this place for the mee sua and it tasted good. We ordered other dishes like Malaysian fried bee hoon and prawn paste chicken. They were quite normal, in fact the bee hoon was quite oily. I must add that the cost wasn't high, it was quite affordable
5
Our kakis enjoyed the food very much. Each time I bring my friends, they are excited to bring their own family.
Air con section only at night. Actually lunch time will be great on weekend for relaxation.
I think this place is 5 stars

Still my most preferred place for their signature dish- Mee suan with herbal soup! Have been pretty consistent!!

This stall is famous and always full of people coming here for its zhi cha and the pig organ soup mee sua. We have sit in the air con side as it is full and the staff just let us sit there. We have to queue up to order our food and the staff is very rude as she say that we have not reserved our seat in advance, they did not put any reserved plate there as well so how do customers know that it is already being reserved. In the end she gave the reserved customer another table. They have also mixed up our beverage order when we wanted hot bartley but served cold instead. Service level has dropped over the years, no doubt the food is still delicious but serving is a bit slower than last time

The signature dish of Singapore is Chili Crab. Always attempting to eat where locals eat and get away from the touristy sites, this was recommended to me by one of the ship workers. Way less expensive than Chili Crab in other places and way better tasting. Be warned, this is an absolutely messy dish. Make sure you know where the handwashing sink is when you are done. I ate simply, a coke, rice and chili crab but it was very, very good and I felt (almost) like a local

It has been a while since I last visited. They have moved to a nice corner shop, cleaner and brighter. Sadly the service was poor. The cleaners were fast to clear tables but a few lady serving staff were selectively attending to customers. Maybe we looked poor. They selectively attend to some and told us to order at the front counter. After we ordered, one of them came around to take order. When I told her we'd ordered, she raised her voice and said it's for drinks. Seriously the Mee Suan was decent, but not good enough for me to put up with the bad staff attitude.

One of the best! Though the name is black chicken herbal restaurant but they are actually a restaurant that offer all kind of Chinese dishes. The best part we like it is most dishes are their self invented dishes and you can find it in another restaurants. Lala bee Hoon is one of my favorite dish there... see photo!

The food is good, and it is consistent. I have been back a number of times. However, be prepared for stinky service. Was told by one of the service staff to sit at a table, and as I was about to sit down, one of the older staff said someone was sitting here and repeatedly badgered me to tell him which colleague had asked me to sit at the table when I said that one of his colleagues had asked me to. He was very rude and did not apologise.

Just returned from an overseas stint and one of the places on my bucket list was Seng Kee.The food in Seng Kee still tastes as good as ever. I had the Herbal Soup Mee Sua, Lemon Lala, prawn cake and sambal potato leaves. The taste of the herbal soup is just nice, not too herbal and delicious. They have maintained their standard even though they had expanded by quite a bit. Kudos to the team!I would recommend this place to any one who is looking for homely, comfort food

We had spent seven days in Singapore and had eaten every breakfast, lunch and dinner out. We were more than satisfied with the delicious and tasty offerings and the wide variety of choice in Singapore's many restaurants.However, on our final night we went to Seng Kee for dinner and we're very disappointed.We ordered chili crab, which came floating in a veritable sea of nondescript sauce, with barely a hint of chili.The Chechen wings coated in prawn paste and deep fried were over cooked and dry, and the Asian spinach with salted fish was cooked too long and was mushy.The pork belly, stewed and served with broccoli and rice buns, redeemed the situation a bit.On top of that our waitress couldn't speak English, Chinese or Malay, so we pondered where she came from and why she was employed as a waitress. Perhaps she was an immigrant worker employed washing up and helping out with the waiting the night we were there because it was very busy.Seng Kee is obviously popular with locals. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong dishes.The bill for three, with one beer and one fresh coconut, was S$125

The place is spacious with around 80pax seating.We had their pre book promotion set for 10 (with sucking pig)and also order their mee sua for my mother because our customs we believe it will extend longevity. "The set is worth eating."We are going to try their lunch menu like la la bee hÃ²on, crispy bee hoon and xo bee hoon for our next trip as recommend for those who need a fast lunch hour.They have many other dishes and we can check it out in their Facebook.

Living nearby we have always noticed this place as being always busy and decided to try it for once. Nothing impressive, just typical local chinese fare in an outdoor setting, Nothing rave about and probably will not be back again.
5
It's open from 11am to 4am.
Lunch time they have fish soup and many additional dishes.
The steam and curry fish head are very nice.
A great place to lunch, dinner and supper.

Visited the place at 2 in the morning while nursing a jet lag. Did some research and found this place which specialises in Herbal Mee Sua. Tasty and steamy, the food hit the spot before heading home to catch a spot of sleep.
5
This noodles only comes with soup, black soup and pork with some liver and kidneys. Very tasty and unique taste to any other sort of herbal soup styled noodles. Be sure to get them to reccomend some side dishes as well to go along with your noodles. Definately worth a try
4
Delicious famous Kidney mee sua 2min walk from kembangan mrt. Broth have good depth. Other must try items include the lala bee hoon and also jb fried Bee hoon. Side dishes like the four heavenly Kings combining eggplant, Lady fingers, long beans and smelly beans provided good crunch and texture. Stir fried with belachan and fried anchovies, this dish will mean children that hates greens come back for more. Service is quite good with your food arriving in 10min after you get your seat. Opens till 4am and makes it a great supper plac

Very much a food joint for locals and expats in the Siglap/Telok Kurau area. Spread over 3 units and overflowed into the open road and building walkways, the atmosphere is noisy, table left dirty by poorly-mannered patrons, bits of food dropped onto the floor, and at times screaming and crying of kids. The fish head curry and "mee sua" are not of international standard. Come here for curiosity. The tourists can use a cab or take the subway to Kembangan mrt station and walk about 300 metres.

Recommended by so many friends to try the food here so went for dinner with my husband one of the nights.Ordered the famous pic kidney, liver and lean meat mee sua and was really up to standard.We ordered the prawn roll which was also nice.Their famous dishes are sesame chicken and steam fish but the serving is generous. Will be good to go with a bigger group to share.Will definitely be back

Often patronise this shop and decided to write a review. This shop had just shifted a few units away. And customers are not allowed to dine on the roadway anymore. Anyway, their must try dish would be kidney soup with mee sua. I would recommend to eat this dish as hot as possible, as it tastes the best when hot. Their pork meat is very tender and fresh. And it goes well with soy sauce chilli. They are also famous for their steam fish. This place opens at 5pm till late. A place for family dinner and a great place for supper
4
For all local food lovers, this is a great dinner place. Must go early, like 5+pm in order to get parking. Queue to order, get seated and be served. Cash only, so bring enough $$$. Mee sua a must, other dishes are in small portions, and can give the crab a miss (at least $52 to $75 per crab)

Seng Kee is famous for their kidney mee sua and steam fish. On a recent visit, its with great disappointment to know standards have fallen. Both the mee sua and steam fish no longer taste like they used to. Especially the kidney mee sua, the soup is not as robust as it used to be. Its such a shame for a food establishment that got famous for this one dish and yet in its bid to expand, has lost touch with the quality of its signature dish(es). I do see a lot of foreign help in the service area and I would assume the same has happened in the kitchen as well. Either that or the need for speed to churn out the dishes due to a larger crowd now might explain it all..

This is one place whereby you get a taste of traditional local food; teochew steam fish, BitterGourd vege, Black chicken soup, sesame soysauce claypot chicken. Service is fast, food is good, value for money, big open space environment.
2
The kidney mee sua used to be one of the best around but standards have dropped tremendously since they occupied the corner coffeeshop. The steamed fish is no longer fresh. Hope one of my favourite midnight eateries improve soon.

Steam fish- best!
mee suah- die die must try-great for confinement!
crab tang hoon - yummy!
everything is fresh & good.
From one coffeeshop to 4 now on same stretch, there must be a reason!
3
If you like Mee Sua, you will definetely like this stall. The soup has a strong herbal flavor.
Good thing about this stall is you can have it middle of the night when you are feeling hungry.
4
Have a go at the steamed fish or the stew mee suah. Fish is very fresh!

good

the kidney mee suan soup is good though I don't eat kidney.

The soup has changed completely, it taste like drinking pepper soup with dark soya sauce, no taste of any broth! They must have changed the chef or owner. It is sad to see many of the traditional food stalls expanding or changing for the worst. No wonder even in Penang they have introduce a new policy to preserve the traditional penang cuisine

My wife ordered the Pig Liver Mee Sua (@$5 per bowl) and found it to OK. I had the signature Black Chicken Herbal Soup (@$15), decided that it was nothing special and a rather small serving. We also shared a bowl of Pig Trotters in Black Vineger with Sliced Ginger (@$12); it was not as good as the stall at Lavendar Street. Overall, my take is this place is over-rated and expensive

Had a very DISAPPOINTING dinner session at Seng Kee Restaurant (Changi Road) during our first and very likely the last time there. Disappointments as follows: - Black Chicken Herbal Soup is extremely EXPENSIVE, at S$13.00 per bowl.Each order is small enough and not enough for one person. Defintely NOT CHEAP in my personal opinion. - Ordered another fried Prawn cracker type (very thin sliced like fried fish cake type) . Priced at S$11.00 with about 8 pieces I think, so each piece is about S$1.50 !! EXPENSIVE!! The total bill presented was S$43.00 (for a family of 2 adult and 1 child):- chicken herbal soup (portion not even enough of one person at S$13.00 !!), - brocolli with mushrooms, - fried prawn cracker, - fried egg, - three bowls of rice. Remarks: - No drinks ordered. - All the dishes were ordered "small". - The bill was given as soon as all the dishes were served.   As I was already disappointed with the portion of the chicken soup and with charge of S$13.00 per bowl, I checked the bill and realised a mysterious item with illegible handwriting decription item stated as S$1.00. I enquired with the staff and was told that it is the "ar char" item (mixed spicy vege/fruit served in small saucer) served with the fried prawn cracker dish. If you do not check the bill properly, the customers would have been charged with an item that they did not order. I asked for the "ar char" and the 3 packets of wet tissues to be returned. The total bill became S$41.50 !!!??? (after S$1 deduction of the "ar char" and 3 wet tissues returned. How did the 3 packet of wet tissues sum up to S$0.50?). Anyway, with so much disappointment with the food and pricey items, I was not bothered about the confusing mathematics calculation that the staff made. If you are visiting this place, please check the bill properly. IMHO, Value for money definitely POOR. Hope to see improvements in Value for Money and Clarity in Billing
