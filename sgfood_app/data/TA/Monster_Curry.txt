Japanese enjoy curry rice and so do we, now at the convenient locations in Singapore. We tried cheesy chicken and chicken curry rice at the Vivo city outlet of the monster curry. Food tasted great, staff is friendly and professional, the service is fast

We went for this restaurant as we saw people eating in this big plates and was something different.
The curry was lovely and because of the size was very unique.
5
Fresh, plate the size of your car. 1 portion easily feed 2 little people or kids.
Curry sauce is like a dark version of chip shop curry sauce, but nicer.
Fish was great and freshly cooked.
Service very good.

Wanted to try this curry place for a very long time and finally get the chance to try it. We 2 person have order the signature curry rice that consist of fish, prawn, pork and cheese. You will need to write in a paper and thereafter handover over to the waitress. The serving of the food is fast and you can choose spicy level, I have ordered a non-spicy as I cannot take chilli. The curry is really huge and we taken a lot of photo together, even for 2 person still considered a lot. The curry is good and delicious, seafood is fresh and pork fried to tender. The rice is also very fragrant and the salad dressing is just nice. Highly recommended and they have many varieties, will definitely be back to try

Came here for lunch. Their portion was quite big, I was able eat this sharing for 2. You can choose the level of spicy of the curry. Wide range of katsu from chicken to pork. When I ordered, there were only like 2 or 3 tables but I had to wait around 15 minutes to had my meal. So if you really hungry, I dont reccomend this one

We ordered 2 jumbo size curries good enough for 5 pax. We liked the signature jumbo set with cheese on top of the pork, prawns, pork belly, etc more than the katsu pork with sausages. Don't worry about the spicy level as it is indicated by ring of heart on top of the curry. Level 5 represents 5 heart rings. It is not as spicy as I thought it to be but the curry tasted delicious. What a hearty value meal!Must try if you love curry

Was hungry and walk by while heading home.Initially paid for the take out meal. However, got a call from my friend while waiting and decided to catch up and meet up at Ion Orchard so decided to dine in instead. But the lady staff over the counter wasn't paying attention and kinda rude to customers regardless is me or the other diners.There's a service charges for dinning too.I must say the curry rice is not bad in taste

Holy Moly dat Curry is Huge!!!Bring your appetite and a bimb if you're messy cuz dis plate is serious business ..... .(or a plate to share) and level 3 spicy ain't nough...for real Monster curry is perfection... Silky smooth curry and ain't no frozen food in the mix.Hands down best value. Best flavor.. And best service

This is a Singapore food fusion restaurant
Japanese food with Singapore curry flavour
Quite a hit locally Flavours local Japanese dishes Combos are interesting one can want the spiciness as to their taste buds

Below average if I compare to those in Japan. Average if I compared to similar in Singapore. Curry is ok. Meat is a little too dry.

Beri good portion size work good price. Very tasty. And quick serving. Clean place. Convenient. Recommended to order fish or tonkatsu pork.

Suitable for 1 hungry adult or to share with adult & child. Had the extra hot (number 3 rating) curry and was abit disappointed that it's their curry plus some squirt of chilli sauce. Bleh. Couldn't they have made various degrees of curry instead?The pork shabu was very little. Like only 4 slices of pork. Bleh. Not that great. But good if you want something non-fried and lighter. Other lunch options were all fried. Taste was not wow but ok. For $9.80++ ($11.50 with tax) and a drink, it's ok for dining in town. You will definitely feel full after this meal! Not super delish but alright to fill up your tummy.

Ordered pork katsu at since level 3 and a bottle of mineral water.Level 3 is not that spicy or rather, the heat goes away after a while.Food was ok but treatment should improve. Maybe I should be blamed for being here alone.I was allocated Seat No. 1, which was beside a mountain of packaging boxes. And the fridge is beside above me. I could hear the engine running while I m writing my review.I wonder what is the criteria of service charge being chargeable in Singapore. I needed to queue to order, I could not choose my own seat and all they did was brought me my food and drinks and have them cleared after.The only consolation is that they didn't drive me away after I have finished my food

I went for the big plate for 2 as it is very interesting and worth the price. we hardly can finished. The curry is fine, not as good as some other we tried. The rest of fried stuff are ok, nothing very special. i dined another day at Nex Serangon and we go for single portion each, surprisingly i found the portion is quite small. So combo meal still worth the price
2
quality of the meet was OK but i just found the curry very disappointing, having a ready made curry mix and adding a hot sauce to it in different amounts to depict the heat level , i guess its in the name of margin, the booth size is small and i found it uncomfortable
5
The larger curry (approx $30) is enough for 2 to share. 2 guys to share. And we are full from it with left overs. That's how much food there is. They have the individual portions as well around $15-16. Ranging from omelette to seafood to pork/ chicken/ fish. Rice is generous and you can choose your spice level for curry. Slightly salty but sufficient in terms of tast

Hmmmm! I've been looking for this big plate whenever I passed the restaurant, but I don't have a chance to eat there before because I don't have someone who can join me. HahaBut, now... one of my friend asked me if we can eat and I was like: "Really?" and at the back of my mind I am definitely happy. FINALLY. So here is my review of the food:The food is good but the fish is typically fred with breading and the sauce seems has a lot of ingredients in it that makes it too rich and extra tasty. I love the side dish and you can ask for more! Since the sauce is rich in flavours, you basically will ask for more plain tasting food (side dish/rice) to either mix with it or to balance the taste.

We two person shared one large bowl. The curry is not spicy. If you like spicy ask for higher spiciness levels. We tried level 1... Regretted as it did not taste like curry. But portions are good and ingredients are fresh. Love the deep fried prawns very much

Usually visit the branch at NEX. The curry rice was superb. Especially loved the Monster combo, which provide many different types of meat. Portion is good for 2 adults. Nice touch that we can specify the spicyness.
Only complain is the lack of beverage choice.
3
It worth a try. The portion was huge. We order 1. We even can't finished it. the curry was nice. We prefer the pork than the fish. You can choose the spicy level. We took the level 1. It was not spicy at all. We will try another level next time

For curry lovers you should try this curry. It's delicious and of course it served in big plate and big portion (so still worth it from the economy side, hehe). You can sharing one plate for 2-3 persons or maybe you can eat it by yourself (full tank in result i think even for man).

We enjoyed our informal meal here. Portions were large, everything fresh, of course, the taste was good although it was not the best I've had. I don't think you could go wrong here for a fast meal. Think about how spicy you ask for it. A good way to punish someone in your party that you don't like is to shame them into ordering something with the hot-ness at the 4th or 5th level. If they're not used to it, it can be fun, if cruel, to watch them try to drink the Singapore River dry to quell the heat. In summary, a good curry meal at a reasonable price, well prepared with a helpful staff.Hope this review helps you. Enjoy

Had the seafood monster combo with an add on of omelette and cheese. Its a huge portion for 2 person. It came with 1 huge fried fish, 2 tempura prawns, 2 fried prawns and 2 deep fried scallops. Obviously it came with rice, salad and curry. You can also choose the spice level for the curry ranging from 0 (not spicy) to 5 (super spicy). The spicy level is just the amount of hot sauce they add onto the curry. However be mindful that the curry served has beef mince in it. As I do not eat any beef, I've only ate white rice that is not touching the curry and the seafood. My husband ate up all the curry with the remaining rice

Read quite a number of reviews about it. Most are positive. However, tastes are very subjective. We were a little disappointed. The curry tasted average, more inclined towards Indian curry instead of Japanese. Not sure if it was supposed to be an Indian restaurant though. Chicken katsu was dry. The positive was that maybe it was worth the price served on a humungous plate

Had a craving for Japanese curry rice for a gew days so decided to try out Curry Monster.Ordered the pork cutlet curry rice at spicy level 2 (extra hot).One can top up with extra sauce, rice, additional ingredients at extra cost.The dish came in a huge white plate with a big piece of cutlet, rice and top up witj shredded cabbage and pickles at the side. I would say the portion is huge.I am a person who loves gravy. The amount of sauce is actually more than enough thus need not top up unless you like your rice soggy (personal experience).The sauce is ok, not spicy on its own. The sauce can be made more spicy with their hot sauce (the level of spicy which you choose at the cashier).I didnt mix in the hot sauce so that i can have 2 spice level on the same plate.The pork cutlet was ok but would have hoped it was more succulent and crispy. The piece was quite thick too. Overall the dish was quite satisfying. The portion was very satisfying.However, i did feel very thirsty after the meal (that was the only meal i had for the day); hope no msg has not been added

Visited this place, very very worth for those with a monster appetite or to share among friends. But their large portion and share among two person. Very worth serving of the different type of meat. Spice level can be changed which is always good. The food prepared by them is always fresh out from the fryer. Awesome quality. Worth the $30+ spend. And after all "split" by 2 pax so $15+/pa

Tried the new branch at Vivo. Minimalist fast-food set up with garish red everywhere!Ordered the Combo ($25) portion and it was more than enough to share. It came with each large piece of Katsu Fish and Pork, two prawns and some Shabu style sliced pork belly, which was a good variety of protein.Curry was tasty and can be ordered up to 5 levels of piquancy; though level 2 was already too much for Jap-style curry, so beware!Canned drinks only and the "cold" service we received didn't quite match the 'hot monster curry' experience we expected

KARE, or Japanese-improvised curry, is popular in Japan. Rather different from what you get in India, it is a sweet version that is eaten with Japanese rice. At Monster, you get a large serving or nice, chewy Japanese short-grained rice with a salad (cabbage/mayo) and the curry sauce on the other side. Most people will add a pork cutlet (tonkatsu) or some other side. The prices range from S$7-10. The rice itself was really nice, not overcooked, firm to the bite. The curry itself was average (you get to choose between 1 and 5 hotness - my recommendation is to stick to 1 because I picked 3 and it was like a spicy Vindaloo+). My side was tori karaage, and I was pleasently surprised that they were quite generous with 4 large chunks. Overall, good. It is a self serve place in probably the most airy and pleasant food court in Singapore and for S$7.80, it was really good value considering it was probably enough for 2 smaller appetites.
