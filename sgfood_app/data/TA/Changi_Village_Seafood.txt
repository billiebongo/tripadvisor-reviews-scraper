As a child these eateries were scattered along the roadside. Now under one roof the smell, the buzz the choice is amazing. Even down to the samples on offer and the banter with the stall holders ... A truly memorable experience.

Great selection of food stalls in this hawker centre. Look out for the stalls with the long queues, the wait will be worth it, if the locals will queue for the food it will be good.

Great place. Well connected by buses. Also accessible by bikes from East Coast Park. Plenty of eating options are available. A good spot to head for a picnic on the seaside, after a meal. Food prices are reasonable. Seating arrangement is clean and tidy.

Came here for a late lunch and a cold drink - the Tiger beer was the coldest I've had in Changi Village! The service was fast and friendly, and the food was very good. They do a homemade tofu which is a stuffed and fried tofu with sauce - very filling! Nice fresh greens

We ordered 3 simple dishes (fried kuay teow, fried chicken & veggie with rice) & waited for 1 hour before all dishes are served. We had to hunt for the cutleries & get our own cut chillies from the kitchen... looking high & low for people to collect bills... pretty amusing when they have 3 service personnel for 10 tables. Honestly the dining experience reminds me of when I am holidaying at a laid back island somewhere in the middle of south China Sea...maybe thatâ€™s part of the package of visiting Changi Village

Wow so many stalls so little time.Liked Weng Kee chicken cutlet Hor Fun,and great oyster omelet around corner from Charlie's Corner Pub,I did like the oyster omelet in Chinatown better. Had a few beers at Charlie's Corner an interesting lot of characters there,but realizes it was near 10pm a lot is stalls were closed I tried the International Muslim Nasi Lemak....small piece if chicken wasn't very impressed but lived the whole area heaps of good foid and a huge variety and not as touristy as Chinatown.

This is an outdoor seating hawker place. The cleanliness can be improved as we saw many birds pecking on unwanted food from table to table.Not meant food choices as before, the only consolation is the char Kway Tiao srill retains its original flavones from 2012

The hawker market at Changi Village is really very good and worth the trip out from the city. If you're at the Changi Museum then it's just a few more stops on the bus to the village. Food prices are half or less than in the city and quality is very good. There's bum boats across to the island or walking/cycling along the waterfront once you've had your fill of authentic Singapore food. Well worth the effort.

A food area which is called hawkers village in Changi with an assortment of food stalls with local delight like nasi lemak,prawn noodles, satay, BBQ wings and chendol mince meat noodle and many more. Located next to a very busy local market.Prices are extremely cheap and the place is very busy as a result of both pricing and quality of the food. Easily accessible by public transport

Changi village has excellent choice of seafood and other dishes. Go to hawker and prices are very reasonable. Food is fresh and tasty, lots of crowd everytime you go there, seems popular with locals.
Good place to have a meal with family.

Went there after reading reviews at other app, said it was good and a must try. Cant get myself to agree with it. Everything just taste normal and deff pricey. Had better seafood else where in SG.

Average seafood dishes and quite costly for its location. Decent settings and service. Don't think i will return here.

Very interesting small place that changed a lot. Sold a lot of retro stuffs that brought much fond memories. Also tons of good choices! Must try. There's even a band jamming by the market! The place gave a Very active and dynamic energy. Must visit to feel the Changi village new "culture"

Nice walk and trees in the park are very pretty. Ocean view not so good, mostly boats and shipping route. Beach is ok, but nothing spectacular.The park connector ends here so it's a nice bike ride or run. You could kayak or sup along shore but cannot get out too far for all the traffic.You can take a boat to Pulau Ubin which is a more interesting way to spend the day

This was the yummiest won ton soup - make sure you go to stall No: #1 - 48 I think it was $3.00 for a medium bowl - the wife makes the wontons in front of you &!her hubbie makes the soup & cooks the noodles.Really basic and a bit grotty But a real experience. Only go to stalls with an "A" rating - it's on all their signs.Lots of other fresh fruit stalls & more - have a wander around.

After Changi Point Boardwalk, we reached Changi Village food centre. It was quite crowded as it was public holiday-Good Friday. Many cyclists were having a rest at this food center to have their breakfast and drink. Usually in morning, many stalls are not opened.We decided to have the famous Changi nasi lemak - Internationl Muslim Food Stall (#01-03). There was small queue of about 5 people. It took about 15 minutes before my term to order two plate of nasi lemak chicken with otak.The nasi lemak is good, chilly is good, chicken wing is also good. The otak is really bad. After the nasi lemak, we have coffee which is not bad.There are many good stalls which we will try the next visit

I can't really be sure this is the same market, so I'll elaborate. RHS of the Changi Hawker Market complex is the 'Chinese Cuisine & Seafood From Hong Kong Street' kitchen. Please check my photo for confirmation. Chinese friends resident in Singapore have brought us here during three past visits. The food is exceptional! Seven dishes, mainly seafood, served nine of us. It was ALL great, but personally I can highly recommend Freshwater Crab... and that wonderful green bean dish! We washed it all down with a 2010 Montrouge, and a Madfish sparkling white from Margaret River. The bill (A$220) didn't include our Tiger Beers. (Thanks, Lee!)After many visits to Singapore, I can happily commend this place as serving food equal to any I've consumed in a city famous for its diverse, delicious cuisine... .Tip: To my best knowledge we weren't charged corkage on our two BYO wines. For exceptional value, this place is truly hard to top
