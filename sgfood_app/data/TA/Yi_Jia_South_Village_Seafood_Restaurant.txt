Had dinner here this evening. A couple of rice dishes and the sweet and sour pork with extra chilli. Very tasty! Catered to our picky requirements and were attentive.
We will be back. :)

A pleasant surprise. Walked in without hearing anything about the place. They had a special offer of two crabs for $50. Werenâ€™t sure what the quality would be like but gave it a try. We firstly ordered salted egg yolk fish skin to have with a beer. It was a little larger than we expected, but it was really good. The fish skin was crispy and the egg yolk was made out of real egg and was delicious. The crab was ordered in a bee hoon noodle style. We had the choice of dry or soupy and opted for the dry. It was very good value and delicious. The two crabs were of a good size and quite fleshy and tasty. The bee hoon noodles were fresh and very tasty. You could tell the flavour from the wok really spread the taste through the noodles and the flavour of the gravy was garlicky but delicious. We topped the meal of with dragon veg, with comes from the Cameron highlands in Malaysia and is crispy thanks to the stem and has a nice fresh quality to it. Overall it was a great meal and just over $100 (thanks to four beers) it was also pretty good value. Will definitely come again

Had a quick dinner at their new outlet at citimac building along MacPherson Road near Tai Seng. First time trying this restaurant. Ordered some noodles, nai bai vegetable with chye poh, venison and salted egg sotong. Although the salted egg dish was good, it would have been even better if the sotong or squid was not as chewy. Hubby thought the noodles were a tad salty. Overall an enjoyable meal.

Frequented this zichar place quite often but today's dinner was disappointing. The sliced fish with ginger and onion was poorly executed. Many slices were broken up instead of intact in a piece. It's lack wok hei too. We also ordered dragon pork ribs, salted egg yolk squid and veg with three mushrooms. They were good. This place charges 50 cents for water

Be sure to order their signature dishes here. The crabs are on promotion and salted egg crabs and sotong is good. Other good eats included clams, salted chicken tofu etc. Prices very reasonable, be sure to try before prices start to go up or some foodie decides to blog about it

Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food which is tasty and delicious. Signature dish is chicken soup and cereal prawns which are must try. Only problem is parking is limited as there's a small public carpark slightly 5 min walk away but always full. Otherwise strongly recommend to give this restaurant a try you won't be disappointed.
