I ordered 1 coffee and 1 tea for take away to a guy on the cashier.
He is very rude, he shouted at me for my total bill, your coffee is good but your services SUCKS!!! (Only for the front liner guy doing the cashier).

We visited this place for breakfast while killing time at Orchard road. We had the waffles without kaya and that didn't taste good. The chicken curry was terrible. Maybe this is because am an Indian and the Singaporean food does not appeal to my palate.

the milk tea and the toast were both very good!we ordered set A, had the warm and crispy toast going with kaya and also the cold butter piece. It just melted in your mouth, leaving such a fulfilling impression!It's good to go for breakfast or afternoon snacks.yet, it was a self-serviced place. But with some $5 per set, it was a fair deal

Coffee and toast is ok but the mee rebus is 0 out of 5 rating as it is nothing but starchy sauce, yellow noodles with a hard boiled egg.$4.50 for this tasteless dish is a major ripoff !Totally disgraceful for lack of attempt and kills my appetiteI don't recommend to try and this chain on my avoid list

It's toasts, butter and jam with soft boiled eggs. But with a twist. The long queues for Sunday breakfast tells it all. The lovely coffee supposedly filtered in a sock ! A modern cafe with a 70+ years of heritage. A nice way to start the day !

I ate there for lunch since I needed to kill time in the airport. I ordered their set which have toast with kaya and soft-boiled eggs. The kaya was good (even thought it was very sweet). Nothing that blew my mind but I was pretty satisfied. Price was decent

Stopped at the outlet in the Pomo centre recently for tea and toast with a friend. Not quite as busy as some of the other venues and it was easy to get a table. Tea and toast pretty standard: $6 for 2 teas and 1 kaya toast.

Had breakfast at a couple of branches, and they are all similar. Quite busy, especially on a weekday morning, but seat available after a short wait.Worth it for the Kaya toast though...really nice local speciality, served both toasted and steamed, this was a big hit with us all. As were the soft-boiled eggs, which on first glance looked uncooked, but weren't and were delicious with a splash of soy sauce. Local coffee also very good.Prices quite cheap - especially if you get the set. Counter service for orders, coffee and eggs and toast delivered hot to your table

In our neighborhood one option for getting breakfast was at the Paragon Mall. I know this sounds totally lame. Believe me. But there was a place a friend had recommended for a local style breakfast Ya Kun Kaya, and they had one there. My kids are willing to try a lot of different foods and I am happy to say they have liked just about everything (so far the only loser was cow brain!). I definitely recommend you try the steamed bread. Get the “set” which is like a meal deal. My kids loved it too

Ya Kun has been my favorite joint for my cup of coffee and some kaya toast since many years ago. I have been drinking their coffee and eating their toast since the days the founder couple ruin their business in Lau Pa Sat till today a multi-branches business managed by their children. Still the same good coffee and toast

Loved the toasts and coffee available here at very reasonable prices. In addition to toasts, they also serve Laksa and other Malay dishes.

This Ya Kun is located at a secluded spot in OC BUT it is fairly crowded on a daily basis. I like to do my work at this cafe, and the coffee here gives that extra boost to complete an assignment.

YA Kun Family Cafe is the bedt local cafe in town I think, asian drink is always have a good taste! you must try this cafe if u visit orchard Rd
4
Local Asian drinks and coffees make this place different to a Starbucks or other such place. That is a good thing. Try items you wouldn't normally have. Barley water is interesting. Kaya on toast is amazing. Would go again.

Kaya toast is delicious. Crispy and tasty.
But iced coffee is not good. Taste is very weak. No aroma and no weight of coffee smell. Like drinking only water.

This is a tiny place located in the basement of the TANG plazaMost of the shops and foot court are not open(11 am)However they are one of those who open earlyWe have their specialty coffee,kaya toast and two soft boiled eggs which come as a packagethere is usually a long Q at the order counterThe toast and the coffee is worth waitin

We had just arrived in Singapore after a long flight and were killing time until we could check into our hotel.We stumbled across this Kaya Toast outlet in Ion mall and ordered a Kaya Toast, Kopi (coffee) and iced milo. We decided not to have the half boiled eggs.We loved it! The toast was thin and crispy and the coffee was delicious. We were to have several more of these meals at various other outlets during our 10 day stay in Singapore, however found this outlet to be the best in quality.Service was pleasant and efficient

I visited Ya Kun Family CafÃ© at Tao Payoh branch today after lunch. I was craving for their Kaya Toast so much. I ordered 2 slides of Kaya Butter Toast Toast which came perfectly crispy without any burnt. The cashier staff here quite friendly and rest just grumpy as usual.

The Concierge at our hotel recommended this cafe as it opens at 7am vs 8am like majority of the other local eateries. We hade the "set" E and F which included a cheese toast or French toast, 2 boiled eggs and coffee. Cost was $11 and eggs were slightly cooked in with coconut milk and toast was small with a sweet kaya butter. My coffee was blended with sweet evaporated milk so for me it wasn't very good. They did bring us some hard boiled eggs but hold was cold so not sure what happened there. They tried which was appreciated. Just not prepared for that type of breakfast. It was a very popular place with many locals rolling through. It was an experience

I knew I want to try Ya Kun at least once on our trip to Singapore in February. Fortunately, we were at a hotel (Grand Hyatt) on Orchard and walking over to Ya Kun was easy. I am not sure if this is the place for the Ya Kun inside Far East Plaza but I think it's the same. I was surprised that it wasn't crowded and we were able to enjoy a good breakfast. We ordered the sets and also some other kinds of toasts. They were all delicious! I don't think I can have this everyday though because of the sugar level. Now that I know they are all over the place in other parts of the world, we could enjoy this unique breakfast as we travel around
