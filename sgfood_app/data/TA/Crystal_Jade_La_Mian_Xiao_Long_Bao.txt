The restaurant is busy so expect to queue during peak hours. The speciality is handmade noodles, dumplings and cantonese staples. The quality is good and service is efficient.

This is not my first time been to crystal jade. I love their dim sum and its affordable! I chanced upon this drunken chicken noodles actually and its i have ever tasted!

Visited various crystal jade entities on ad-hoc basis as the price point is rather steep in my opinion due to its relatively small portion of dishes. Across the various outfits, standard of food is consistently good and my kids enjoyed the porridge, crispy chicken, fried wanton, fried white bait, fish with ginger and scallions and La Mian particularly.

I dropped into Crystal Jade in Bugis Junction for a light meal. We ordered a couple of serves of the xiao long baos, one was an interesting salted egg variant, drunken chicken and some deep fried chicken wings.Th Xiao long baos were decent. Pity they were not really hot enough though. The salted egg variant eas interesting but AiYam think we might stick with the standard ines next time! The drunken chicken was ok but a bit too much rice wine. Deep fried chicken wings were pretty standard. Overall, average but nothing special

The restaurant put a snack plate on your table before your ordered food is served without asking you. While you think its complimentary, there is a 'pickles' item on your bill charging you for $1.7. This is not about $1.7 a plate, this is about the credibility of a business. I felt i was mis treated, not respected. I will not come to this restaurant back again, i will not recommending anyone to come to this restaurant again!!!!!!!

I love to eat chinese food that are simple and with traditional flavours. We order wanton noodles, pan-fried pork bao and tofu skin ribbon with soy bean. They are all nicely cooked and done. To end off the dinner with a hot dessert glutinous rice ball in fermented rice wine

A crowded place in a food court. Nothing for someone who likes silence and a view. Located in the basement of Bugis it is a typical court place where you go for food only, but not for the ambiance. The food was good but a little expensive I have to admit. The restaurant itself is a kind of mass fabric. However, I can recommend it but I would not go there for a second round

Service was very quick but we got the impression they just wanted to hurry you up. Went at lunchtime and it was not busy. The staff were not very friendly either. Food was OK but overpriced for the area.We were charged on the bill for wet towels! and also pickles which we did not request or use, these were reluctantly taken of our bill.Not an enjoyable experience

If you stay near Bugis, or Lavender; it's a good place for enjoying dimsum. The shacha sauce put on the table is good, you can take as much as you want. We got famous Xiao Long Bao, Ha Kau, Beef noodle, drunken chicken and fresh cucumber salad. The Xiao Long Bao serves its fame, it's juicy with thin cover which will need your care when taking it out of the container. However, the most tasty one is Haku, with fresh shrimp inside and thin cover. Beef noodle is good too, however, the soup need a little salt. The cucumber salad is fresh and tasty, however, it's overpriced in my opinion. Drunken chicken is not our recommendation, as the name, you can taste the wine with the chicken and it's so weird to us. Will come back again for Xiao Long Bao and Ha Ka
