The Moghul Mahal is a restaurant in the Novotel Hotel, with a great view of the famed Clarke Quay. The food was decent and the ambience too had an authentic feel to it.

Lovely food, service and great value for money. Highly recommended for delicious Indian food. Extremely comfortable and affordable for a nice customized food - great for large gettogethers as well.

They serve us a good quality of Indian food. Their hospitality was fair. The best part is viewing from resturant.

Rediscovered this place in Khalsa Association Building in Tessenshon Road. My family ate at this restaurant often in the 1980s (in their old Colombo Court and later at their Clarke Quay locations) and my children loved the food. We were pleased to find them in this new location and after 2 lunches and 2 dinners in about one month, found that they have not lost their old magic. Their Chicken Chikori is still as unique and and their tandoori meats are still dishes to be savored.They are now offering lunch and dinner buffets in weekdays at surprisingly low bargain prices. I recommend their buffet, unreservedly, - for good value.

Visited Moghul Mahal for the first time at its new location (believe it has been at the Khalso Club, Tessensohn) for almost a year now. New place is quieter, restaurant nicely done, food is still of the same high quality and price is reasonable for fine dining. One of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore.

Moghul Mahal has moved from Clarke Quay to Tessensohn Road. Fortunately the food has remained excellent. We ate the papdi chaat, butter chicken, seekh kebab, paneer bhurji and black dal. The dal and butter chicken were standouts. Excellent service and great value for money. Certainly one of the best North Indian restaurants in Singapore.

Moghul Mahal is located in Novotel and it is recommended to call ahead for reservations. Opt for a table by the window to compliment your dining experience with views of Clark Quay by day or night.The chicken makhni which is essentially a spicy variant of butter chicken is highly recommended. The chicken tikka was a good appetiser.The butter nan and palak paneer are delicious. The kulfi is fairly authentic and recommended.Service is attentive and efficient. Definitely worth visiting

We ate here twice and on both occassions the food was good and the staff were great. The staff are attentive and friendly. What I particularly like here was the ordering via iPad. This gave this experience an interesting aspect. It made us all talk about the menu more than we usually do. When we were ready we placed our order. There were complimentary popadums and pickles to eat whilst you ordered which was nice. The restaurant over looks Clarke quay which was good. The food was superb. The portion sizes were good. Dinner for 5 people which included starters, mains and coffee and including alcohol was $191. Stand outs were the onion bhaghis, dal makini, butter chicken, sizzle plate and the coffee

I came here when I was Visiting Singapore and i was looking for a good reasonable priced indian meal but it was not good as it was Great.They had great Butter Chicken/ Murgh Makhni and their Naan's tasted really good. They had great service and the view from the is awesome. At the end of the meal I paid $20 including my drink of fresh lassi.  I would totally recommend this place to people looking for great indian food

The food was good, but they rely on technology instead of taking down an order, the system they use on an iPad is the worst I have ever seen or used, we did not get the right food, and had to wait for the rice. Why can't they have someone who can write down the correct order and ensure that all the order is delivered together without us having to remind them
5
The food was stupendous. Great mix of both South and North Indian food. Must really go with an empty stomach to savour everything! The servers have great knowledge of the menu which makes things a lot easier for us. Must go!

I really loved this place.
Location: Perfect
Food: Awesome (Must Try: Onion Kulcha and Chana Masala)
Price: I would say price is on a cheap side considering the location, food quality and ambience.

We had a buffet at Moghul Mahal, and it did make us forget we were in Singapore and felt as if we were in INDIA.
4
Had been there for lunch. Food served there was tasty. Variety of Indian food is served here. Food is not very spicy. Service is good. Recommend this restaurant for those who search for authentic food in Singapore.

The entry to the restaurant is quite majestic with Lord Ganesha at the entrance.The food is awesome and so is the service.The restaurant had a spectacular view and the lady at the restaurant was on her toes to ensure everything is in order. Goan fish curry and Dal tadka were too good.I had been to this restaurant in sep 2008 also.
5
Went there for dinner on a quiet Monday night with friends and was really pleasantly surprised. From the kebab starters to the paneer starters to their butter chicken and dal makhani everything was really really delicious leaving us with wanting more. Will definitely return when the Indian cravings hit again

Recently ate there and it was very mixed. The good points, great waiter, very helpful. Good view, especially of fireworks show at night. Fish tikka, great fish well done.Bad points goan fish curry used battered dory fish, awful. Venue is tired and grubby, wallpaper peeling, seats ripped and worn. Owner/manager who served our food, just grumpy and rude.Expect more from a Novotel outlet

This restaurant is housed in Novotel Hotel in the Clarks Quay , a very picturesque place of Singapore. The restaurant serves vegetarian and non-vegetarian Indian food , but not South Indian. View of the landscape (or rather waterscape) from the restaurant is magnificent ; but I shall not use that adjective for the food . We tried three non-vegetarian preparations . We were certainly not disappointed , except a bit for the mutton dish. But the name and grandeur of the hotel (Novotel) plus the touristy location arouses one's expectation from the food also. this expectation remains only partly satisfied. The restaurant did not seem to have been adequately patronised , leaving some empty tables even at peak lunch time. It is pricey. But it is a welcome deviation from the restaurants in crowded Little India which is regarded as the prime centre for Indian food

One of the worst places to dine is Moghul Mahal, Novotel Clarke, Singapore. I visited on 17th Feb 2015 and was disappointed. It is very expensive and the quality of food is average. The main problem with the restaurant communicated to me is that the owners are very rigid and arrogant. Whenever one visits the restaurant you only find emptiness. The Clarke Quay is one of the most happening places in Singapore and to find any restaurant empty should be a cause for concern for the owners. My ratingsLocation - 09/10Ambience - 1/10Food - 1/10Service 2/10Value - 0/1

We went to Moghul Mahal on a weekday for lunch and found our craving for Indian food satisfied well at the end of it.Our menu (with rating of 1-5, 5 being the best):1. Chicken Reshmi Kabab- 42. Mutton Boti Kabab- 2 (was a bit raw at the centre)3. Murgh Panjabi (Brown Gravy)- 5: highlight of the day!4. Assorted breads- 4 (a special mention for the fantastic Roomali Roti after a long long time)5. Mix Veg Raita- 3Overall, the bill was around S$ 90 all-in (after adding soft drinks). Pretty much at par with what you'd have to pay for Indian fare in this area (Clarke Quay). But I believe it does steal a March over some of the more hyped restaurants in the area. Seating space is good being a part of Novotel Hotel, but yes you'd miss the buzz of waterfront at CQ.Overall- this place is for very good food, not necessarily a complete dining experience

Steps away from the vibrant Clark Quay, definitely worth a try to enjoy the indian food. Situated on level 6 of novotel hotel, dine while you have a gud view of clark quay below you, downtown till Marina Bay Sands

For Singapore where you can find some excellent Indian food, this joint is a major letdown. Food is of average quality and the taste is just ordinary. Service not the best either

Had dinner here one Sunday evening. Food was tasty and good portion sizes. Service was slow but friendly. Nice surroundings and views overlooking Clarke Quay. Prices reasonable.
4
The food was good & the service was great if not slightly OTT. The samosas went really well with the masala chai served in a clay cup & cinnamon stick as a stirrer

Was here for a friend's party. Food was average. Service was good. Location is quite convenient though.

After trying at different Indian restaurants in Clark quey, Singapore, I had dinner at the restaurant and found the taste of food very authentic and was cheaper than any other Indian restaurant in the area. If you are looking for some good Indian food in Singapore -- please try this

Located in the Novotel hotel, this restaurant is not the easiest to find (especially with some construction that forces you to take an elevator then stairs), however it's a great find with typical Indian restaurant decor, a view overlooking neon-lit Clarke Quay, tasty North Indian food (the soft, thin roomali rotis are a favourite) and reasonable prices for what it is.

The place provides food cooked in indian style. However the taste may not be same like in India. Some foods taste good, but not all. Chicken was not very good. Veg dishes tasted decent. The environment is nice and someone wanting the desi style may give a visit

Was there during lunch on a Friday. We were the only customers throughout the lunch. That was a bit strange as I was told the place could get very crowded at times.We had cheese naan, boneless chicken cooked in curry and mango lassi. All tasted good. A kid-friendly place with highchair, kiddy utensils and ice-cream

we visited this place on a saturday evening. there was a birthday party going on- the music was extremely loud. so we had to shout at the top of our voice to talk to our friends. also around 8.30pm, there was sudden surge of tourist who were ushered to a dining hall.inspite of poor environment, the food was good. we tried- papri chat, mixed grill- which was delicious. avoid reshmi kabab- not as sacculent.my friends liked the butter chicken and rogan josh. cheese nan was a big hit with young members of my family
