Soup is so good, warming, flavoursome and packs a real punch! Absolutely love it, and the noodles are just right. QQ!

I venture to Old airport road food center for breakfast/lunch on a Monday. I learned many hawker stalls were closed but some good ones were still open including Albert Street Prawn Noodle.I read about this well rated space but I was disappointed when the article said its closed on Monday. I was pleasantly surprised to find it open when I arrived and as I was deciding on my main dish. Venture out and explore this old school center. It's not fancy (most aren't) but locals still recommend it

There is always long queue in this Albert Street Prawn Noodles stall. The stall owner ONLY cooks certain quantities of prawns and ensure the fresh prawns are cooked on the spot before they cook the noodles.Always enjoy the food and the soup is simply awesome and you can ask for more if you don't feel satisfied to your heart content subject to availability of the soup as they cater enough for all customers
