During our stay in Singapore, that was our breakfast oasis, nothing could beat DJ Bakery for a cup of coffee and a huge variety of pastry

We spent 4 days in Singapore and one of the best things we found in Singapore was DJ Bakery. Delicious food, the best place in the city for a cup of coffee and a piece of nice cake.

Tried the bread n kueh bahlu from this bakery at Esplanade. They are nice and there's quite a wide variety to choose from. The watermelon cake looks delicious too.
