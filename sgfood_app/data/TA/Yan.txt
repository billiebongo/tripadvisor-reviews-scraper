Pleasant Experience for family dining and tasty food. Love the broccoli with scallops. Good service too. Will be back for another visit.
5
Very high end dim sum . Pricey for the food but worth it . All item serve hot and fast . service from the manager is professional
5
It was an awesome experience with extreme service. Food was value for money and the taste is real good
5
This was our second visit. The food was superb - quality ingredients well executed. Terrific ambiance too - all in all, a wonderful dining experience!

Just went there for a wedding lunch today. Food was average, service was horrid! One of the managers came to our table with a jug of beer and wine and served the guys the beer and walked away several times without serving wine to empty glasses for the women. Considering that I've wanted to try this restaurant for ages, I'm very disappointed.
4
On our last night in Singapore we had for the most part an excellent meal at Yan. Unfortunately as the food was exceptional as was the setting the service left too much to be desired. Although the restaurant took our 9:30p res (they sever until 10:30) we were rushed through our meal not only being asked to order desert as we were being served our entrees before we were finished with those entrees we presented with the check, the first time we told the server we were not ready for the check only to have the server present the check several minuets later telling us that the kitchen was closing. From the time we ordered we felt it was about serving us quickly and getting us out so the restaurant scan close. All and all the food and ambience were very good, but the service lacked understanding that food is only one part of the entire experience
4
Staff were good and friendly. They were quick and also responsive.Premise was nice and clean. It was also tidy. Air con was like Antarctica however. Decor was good and subtle and didn't reach the eye sore level.Food was good. The suckling pig made me have sweet dreams at night. The tofu was beautiful. The vegetables were served in perfect doneness. Desserts were just mediocre though.Would I go again? Sure. For work and for family it's good. But for couples, I don't think this is a good place
4
Went to celebrate dad's birthday. The manager was kind to give good recommendations. He tried to stop us when he feels it was more than enough for us. We were really very full. Really want to recommed their claypot rice and deep fried soon hock. Delicious.
4
We opted for a credit card special 1 for 1 menu, which worked out to be just slightly better than the standard lunch deals offered at Yan. Each dish arrived at a fairly good trot, each well-executed but nothing really stood out. Good ingredients, such as whole abalone and sea perch, but I wouldn’t expect less for the price. Seating was lovely in a booth, and there were many, so it was a relaxed affair, and spacious. We brought along a 6 month old baby with no issues. Service was generally good. Will return for family lunches etc.
4
Brought 26 residents from an old folks home to lunch at Yan restaurant in National Gallery. As usual I was very happy with the food the manager has chosen. They were cooked to suit the elderly and yet very delicious.
4
Yummy all the way. Attentive knowlegeable and patient service staff. Very fresh ingredients and good portion.
5
If you are looking for a quiet & nice ambience for a meal, Yan is the place for you. Good quality Chinese fare & dim sum. A great place to visit.
4
Yan have a very good atmosphere for gathering. They staff is nice and the service very good. But it good that the food taste can be slightly more "heavy"
5
My husband and I were craving Peking duck and thought we would splurge on Yan for a Sunday night dinner. The restaurant is gorgeous and the service is good. Peking duck was delicious here!
3
Had the Peking duck, scallop with asparagus and wasabi prawns. The last 2 were very good. The Peking duck however was a disappointment. It's quite gamey. Not sure where they sourced their duck from but it's definitely not good
5
I was a bit sceptical about going to this place. But the options to dine at the National Gallery have all been amazing and this was the only restaurant I hadn’t tried.The ambience is nice with round tables and is quite a cosy small restaurant; so don’t expect the fancy aura or the Saha kind of ambience . When we were given the menu; I was disappointed as the veg options were limited. But then the manager came in to take our order; he suggested a spring onion ginger fried rice; a tofu in schezwan sauce and stir fried broccoli and asparagus in black pepper sauce. The food was incredibly good !!! Small choices but they got it so perfect. We even had a mixed vegetable dimsum that was pretty good and jasmine tea.I would definitely suggest a visit to this place once
4
Yán is one of the restaurants found in the National Gallery Singapore (which in itself is worth several visits!) which specialises in peking duck. The duck was perfectly cooked, and so were the other dishes we ordered: crispy friend chicken, honey barbecue glazed pork, kailan in oyster sauce, shrimp dumplings, salted chicken and fish fried rice and braised mushrooms. Their jasmine tea was light and helped us wash down all the food we ordered. Our bill for all that food was just a tad over SGD200 - not bad at all for the amount of food we had! The restaurant is cozy and staff are attentive. Will definitely recommend for those who want to marry contemporary art with great Chinese cuisine
5
Good food, good ambience. National Gallery is the ideal place to set up a restaurant like this. Classic feel.
4
They are understaffed so service was slow but somehow the service staff managed to meet all our needs. :) Ambience is great, and the food presentation was amazing. Price is reasonable for the quality of the food. we were given a corner seat and they had a small back door that opens out to the rooftop gardens of the national gallery - so the kids had fun running outside while the adults had tea. overall great experience :
5
Ordered peking duck and white pepper beef cube with asparagus, no regret on the dishes. In addition, the pumpkin broth with crab meat and also dessert in coconut are very good as well. Service is excellent and cozy envinronment, suitable for friends gathering or even business event
5
Grad dinner with family of 13. 5 medium sized dishes were sufficient for all with desserts to end. Vincent was very attentive and efficient. Definitely coming back!
5
The Food is tasty, ambience is wonderful. Service is great. It's fine dinning cuisine. Staff is attentive and food is served in a timely order.
Will definitely go again
5
Was impressed with the friendly service which made me and my guest felt at home. Food portions were good for the pricing and delicious.
4
Had a perfect dim sum lunch at this attractive rooftop restaurant conveniently located at the National Gallery of Singapore. In addition to the usual array of dim sum, this venue offers two distinctly Singaporean dishes: chili crab dim sum (in a doughy baked bun) and hainanese chicken with glutinous rice steamed in a lotus leaf, complete with the traditional hainanese chicken sauces. The ambiance is lovely, with elegant bamboo twig dividers between tables adorned with white tablecloths
4
This is my second visit. It was still a nice experience. Just that the restroom is quite a walk. Service was average and didn’t notice any outstanding service
4
Great birthday celebration at Yan - staff brought out complimentary birthday pau, which was beautifully presented. We were also able to order cocktails from the cocktail bar above "Smoke & Mirrors". The peking duck was delicious. The restaurant was beautiful however the let down was the ambiance, it was completely empty during dinner time?
5
Dishes are delicious cleverly crafted and fresh. An example is the chicken broth served In a coconut, hence giving that subtle fragrant tinge of coconut flavour as you savour the soup. Traditional Cantonese Føod served as expected such as cured meat. Not cheap but overall high quality food and service for the well heeled.
3
I searched online and found they have a Chope discount 1-for-1 and went to their website to make comparison. The Chope menu is definitely cheaper. I booked, made reservation and went there on the actual day. I like the location for its not a crowded location. I walked into the restaurant. I like it as the ambience is nice. Well decorated restaurant. Service is excellent, probably because there wasn't much table but nevertheless it's good service. Food is slightly above average. Price is not worth. For me the price does not match the food. It's also very small portion and was not full. I had to end up going for round 2 with my friend to fill the stomach. The original price is $190 for one person which I think personally is too expensive. I got it at 1-for-1 and even paying $95 per person I still think its too expensive. For that portion and quality, I think the most it is worth $70. If not for Chope, or any other discount, I will not go back there again due to price. Other than that, everything else is good
5
Another satisfying meal with the family at YAN where our dining experience has remained consistently good. Good choice of innovative dishes including desserts, friendly & helpful staff make the family feel comfortable & happy. This is definitely a place where we would recommend others to dine.
3
It was my 2nd visit to this restaurant. I was satisfied for my 1st visit and therefore, I invited my guests for dinner and hope to impress them. However, it was quite disappointed this time. The worst dish was stir-fried watercress which was a complete failure. The watercress was old and the dish was tasteless. I was so disappointed so I rejected outright for this dish. In the end, they accepted my rejection to waive the charge
3
They have limited dim sum choices. Worth mentioning will be the custard bun.
Service was slow on the weekend and some staff were not that friendly.
4
We were there for a big family gathering, with 2 tables and many kids. The staff were attentive to our needs and were able to anticipate our needs. Food was delicious, as usual. Thumbs up!
5
excellent option was offered due to dietary restrictions. food presentation and taste was excellent. service was good.
4
The restaurant is located in the national gallery of Singapore. A lot of delicious menu to choose ,really convenient after looking exhibition in the morning.
4
Nice dining room, although it’s a pity they can’t take advantage of the rooftop location to offer any view. The menu has many innovative dishes (eg. prawn and crabmeat dumplings with tiny abalone, chilli crab buns, 1000-layered tofu, noodle ball, etc). They’re all competently executed, but with no special refinement and overall there’s no wow factor. Service is courteous, albeit a tad slow at times. Pricey for what it offers; potential is so much higher than reality
5
Was there with Boss for Lunch. Good service, Quality food, good ambience. Highly recommended for corporate lunch
3
We ordered the set meal for 2, it took us about 2 hours cos the food were served really slow.Despite calling beforehand to arrange for birthday shoutao and specifically requesting it to be served as a surprise, the moment we arrived the staff spoilt the surprise by asking what flavours we wanted, this could have been done over the phone when i clearly specified for it to be a surprise and not to mention about it.
5
Super meal at Yan as usual. The highlight of the dim sum lunch was a pumpkin shaped dumpling dessert stuffed with pumpkin/ date paste
4
We had the prawns with thousand island sauce and wasabi sauce (鸳鸯虾球), scallops, and fried rice with shrimp and pork (扬州炒饭). I loved the prawns which are succulent and fresh. Scallops slightly over done. Fried rice is ok, definitely better ingredients in this fried rice than what you get in a casual restaurant. Portions are surprisingly pretty big so I recommend you get the small dishes if you want variety.The service is attentive and polite. The tableware is also very intricate. Good place for impressing guests I think.
4
Had lunch with family member yesterday at about 1.30pm.was waiting for some time even though had made reservation & had informed the manager.fortunately young waiter Calvin noticed & quickly made effort to attend to us. We enjoyed the dim sum he suggested.We were impressed with Calvin's efficient & professional service.the bak kut teh xiao long baos were interestingly tasty & Hao gao very fresh.we gave feed back about the braised duck,yam in plum sauce dish to Calvin.the duck meat at bottom of clay pot were burnt &plum sauce overpowering though rest of duck were tender.we will definitely return for the most delicious glutinous chicken rice in lotus leaf complete with ginger,chilli &black sauc
5
Really nice place to dine, with private seating areas and many booth seats to accommodate bigger families. Food was good, and service was excellent. Kudos to the manager on duty on 25 Aug who went above and beyond in service. We had a lovely dinner.
5
Excellent food and service. Ambience was good. Enjoyed the Peking duck, prawns, Beancurd, sweet and sour pork ! Thumbs up!
4
Yan is a great place for family gathering over dim sum lunch. Food is good with warm and friendly staff. Nice ambient with lots of natural light. Can visit the National Gallery Museum after a good meal👍🏼
4
When I was there with friends, the manager suggested that he chooses three kinds of Dim Sum and recommended a soup and Peking duck. However, the three Dim Sums were all of prawn ones thus lacking in variety. Soup was so so. I think dim sum selection could have been more varied.
4
Tried their set menu for 6 pax including the peking duck. Duck was good but the skin would be nicer if it was heated up. Ambience is good!
4
We were the first customer at 11am, the crowded started to pour in around 12pm. Managed to enjoy the ambiance before that, service staff were attentive too. I had the set lunch. The dim sum trio and desserts were average but the rest of was quite nice. I also ordered an ala carte Bak Kuh Teh Xiao Long Bao (Aug's special), it was good. Browsed through the menu, seemed like their ala carte items tempts me more. However, overall it was good experience and I would to visit again to try other dishes. Lastly, for the price I'm paying for the set meal, I am not complaining
4
My first visit to Yan Restaurant. I am encouraged by the Indulgence (Grand Park Hotel) manager to select the 1 for 1 promotion (for members only). I googled their website but couldn't find this promotional menu. Went ahead to make a lunch reservation. Booked on Saturday(12/08/2017). It was FULLY BOOKED. I booked a 15th Aug lunch appointment. Told my 2 sisters and my wife that it is a 5-Stars meal i.e. Same ingredients but definitely high quality and fresh. Told the 3 of them to pamper ourselves with fine French Restaurant styled service. Had to prepare them in case they complain-Not full, still hungry. Glad that they were ALL HAPPY.Ordered the 1 for 1 promo. though I do not know what we will be eating. I asked for the Set Menu later.The service was what I envisaged and I guess attentive service will be given at working weekday lunch. Spoken to the restaurant manager. He told me that being a small restaurant, they had to focus on good quality food to generate the income. I shall let the reader experience it themselves. For ATTENTIVE SERVICE, I suggest a weekday lunch. Not sure for weekday Dinner.OK. I will let the restaurant doing the rest of the talking
4
Came here with a low expectation and ended up being impressed by the creativity of some dishes. The siew mai and ha gao are normal but some other dishes are unique.I highly recommend people who see my post to visit this place and try it out
4
Good quality of food, though a little salty to my liking. Service was superb! Thanks to Wendy for her thoughtfulness and attention to details. Our guests were all impressed and enjoyed themselves. So glad I chosen Yan for my mum 80th birthday celebration! Great Work Wendy
4
The Peiking duck was delicious. Adding $10, I got the duck meat to be fried with Ee Fu noodles. Absolutely the right choice! We also ordered the steamed eggplant which was garnished with panfried minced pork. Tea was attentively refilled most of the time. For two persons(duck + eggplant + tea) we spent sgd90+.
4
Went for set lunch at 38++ per pax. Food is tasty and of good quality but quantity might be too little for a big water though. Overall service was excellent too.
5
Perfect for celebratin occasions in a comfortable setting. Great tasting food and great service by the staff!
5
Great dining experience with good service! Thumbs up for peking duck & steamed sea perch! I will be back for more. Thank you so much. :)
5
Great Ambience and a great place celebrate such occasion! Can consider visiting its not a very large group!
5
Have been to YAN many times and will still continue to patronise. Whenever I cannot decide what to order, Wendy a staff of Yan will recommend something to match my menu. Another person who can plan a very good menu, is the manager Mr Shek, just by listening to his suggestion makes you drool. My favourite dishes are steamed sea perch with taufu, two style prawns, bee hoon braised with purée pumpkin and roast duck, the best. Good presentation of food and good service too. YAN is number one on my list for Chinese restaurants.
4
The restaurant had 3 round table for 12, and about 10 small table for 4, well placed very comfortable and classy environment. Since our host got the whole place, I was wondering how can they serve lauriat. In they end, they were serving food properly portion by the plates. Food were so good, dimsums, peking duck, shrimp with wasabi and salted egg, shark fins soup. all excellent food, which equally great service. Experience worth remembering and sharing
4
Nice food. Good service. Nice setting. Only the air con is too cold and the food become cold.Would come again
3
Generally we had a pleasant lunch. Initially I was upset because the service was hurried. I was upset that a restaurant that touts itself so highly, could be so unobservant as to bring to the table the second course while we were only halfway through our first course. One of the staff apologise profusely (that I felt remorseful for being so upset). The rest of the meal continued pleasantly, served course by course. We had 2 platters of the assorted dim sum, 3 hot and sour soups in young coconuts, 1 soup of the day, 3 half lobsters with chardonnay sauce, 1 half lobster with egg white and Chinese wine, 1 plate braised duo vermicelli, and 4 bowls desserts. The assorted 6-pc dim sum platter was okay, pretty ordinary.The hot and sour soup was cooked in a young coconut, served with a very small crab claw, strands of daikon, a bread stick, and a glass of coconut water. The young coconut flesh was delicious, and the coconut water was a wonderful idea.The half lobsters were pretty good, which can be cooked in any of 8 ways. I chose mine to be deep fried and served with chardonnay sauce.The duo vermicelli (two types of white noodles) served with crab meat, bean sprouts, in a pumpkin puree sauce was really good. Dessert was ordinary but my friends were impressed with the hot almond cream.My personal favourites were the hot and sour soup (coconut combination), and the duo vermicelli. And we would like to commend Vincent Ng and the other wait staff for the attentive service
1
Food was almost tasteless. Wasn't informed beforehand that all promotions were not valid on special occasions. Very disappointed
4
The food at Yan's was good, especially the suckling pigs but be sure to preorder it. The service was great as well. However, the area we were seated was quite warm.
4
Had the $38 lunch set as well as the $68 lunch set. Topped up $4 to get the coconut dessert (love!) Tasty meal with lovely presentation, albeit on the pricey side.
3
Overall was not bad. Good scenery. Food was served rather quickly. Friendly staffs. Peking duck was good.
4
It's a Must to order the Peking duck dish. Highly recommended. It's a place for young and old if you like Cantonese food. Good service and well trained staff.
3
The place was pretty small and the private dining rooms were overrated as seen in pictures. Signature food items tasted decent but nothing to shout about- hence not justifying the steep price. Service was good and prompt.
1
The captain insisted that the set menu must be 2 persons minimum per set!There were 3 of us couldn't he be more flexible! It is after I showed my dissatisfaction that he said he will do the set!Food came cold tables were not laid out with the appropriate cutlery and the captain didn't come back to my table! Neither did the staff come and clear tables and had to be signalled
3
Ordered a suckling pig, wasnt up to expectations, though it was a nice touch that it was prepared in three ways. Peking duck was normal and the food was nothing to shout about.No view, low ceiling restaurant. I was impressed by the service given by the staff, attentive and really sincere, which is a plus point
4
bought a voucher from Chope. got discount for whole peking duck...however, it is too big for only 2 of us ... they wrap the duck for us and serve it. but it was very nice one although it getting cold very fast. will try other dishes in the further
4
went for a birthday celebration, tried both the dim sum and main dishes from ala carte menu. nicely located at national gallery.
5
My second visit here and I'll still be coming back for more! Visited yan for a family dinner and we ordered the yan Peking duck. The skin in the pancakes were superb with the audible crunch when you take a bite. We also ordered the 2 combination meat platter and the meat simply melts in your mouth! The char siew is perfectly roasted to ensure that the flavour hits you while maintaining a crispy layer on the outside and the 'melt in your mouth' middle. Another favourite that i ordered for the second time was the thousand layer beancurd. It's a visual stunner with the beancurd beautifully laid out in a fan - it's tough not to admire the amazing handiwork that went into prepping it. It tastes just as good to!I'd definitely recommend it for a family, especially for the grandparents! My ahma was a big fan, and I'd never seen my sister eatSo much Chinese food before
4
Food are good, nice place, love the chinese pancake is very nice, I think not enough manpower, when we reached there nobody attended us for about 10mins, give us the wrong order, service so so..... All over not too bad, will try again and hope the services can be better
4
Ordered the Mother's Day Special Menu. Taste is okay, the ingredients are premium. Service is above average.
4
I was treated to a private dining feast here and enjoyed every dish. I especially recommend the duck pancakes.
5
The food, service and seating were excellent and the atmosphere is conductive to a quiet, more intimate dinner that offered by many restaurants today. Old style elegance with contemporary flair.
4
The visit with Entertainer app is very worthwhile. There were more scallops than asparagus (!) in our dish and 4 large dishes could easily feed 6 pax. For the quality, the 1-for-1 price is a steal.
3
Needs to pay attention to decoration details and staff service. Food was good though for the price point I would really look for a holistic experience
2
As a fine dining restaurant, this place was pretty thick-skin to have cancelled 1/3 (maybe even more) of their menu, arguing that "we're going to revamp our menu". When asked when that's going to happen, they said "June".What kind of fine dining restaurant runs a menu where 1/3 of their menu is unavailable, for 3 months? The stickers that say "unavailable" didn't even look new. Clearly, the owner do not understand the commitments to "fine dining" beyond those very steep price tags. Not to mention repeated offering of rejected starters and repeated asking of tea
3
My five friends and I ordered a total of 2 starters and 6 main dishes. We were served our second starter only about an hour after our arrival. The service only picked up after half the restaurant had cleared out. Food was decent but nothing spectacular.
4
If you plan to hold a solemnization cum lunch, here is a good place to consider. The room is reasonably big plus they have a table set up for 13 people. Service was good and the food is quite good. Maybe it really depend on the dishes you ordered. For 13 people, it cost about S$ 1,300
3
It was just ok given the fact that they have an expensive menu. The roast duck was good. But for the rest of the dishes, the portions are small. For a party of 5 people, we had to increase the size.
3
Came expecting good quality chinese fine dining but wasn't wowed by the food. Taste-wise was decent but would have expected more given the prices I was paying for. Still a nice place to go, especially for business meals with the quiet ambience.
4
Great food, great staffs(except one) and great ambience. A little expensive (say $120 for a 600 gram fish) but it was super delish. Can be more lenient on the price.
4
We really enjoyed our lunch today. We hadn't booked - just took a chance after Such an interesting morning in the Gallery. We opted for Set Lunch B. Very tasty soup with sweet corn, light interesting mixed dim sum, yummy prawns, chicken with noodles and greens and a mango pudding. Perfect sized portions for lunch and very nicely presented. We had lovely service from everyone. We liked the room and were impressed we were given a large comfortable table when it was just the two of us. I recommend this place and it's a very attractive setting on the top floor of the National Gallery.
5
Arriving before sunset and go up to the terrace to have a view before dinner is a must. This should then be followed by another after dinner walk to soak in the night scene.Now for the restaurant. The ambiance is excellent for you to impress and entertain your guests. Food is also excellent.Chicken soup in Coconut ( 9/10 ) - well balanced clear soup with that tinge of coconut fragrance. Suckling pig (9/10) - presented in 3 ways, Crispy Skin, sides of the pig and the ribs re-baked on a bed of lemongrass. Skin is really crispy except the pieces are cut into sizes that are slightly bigger than usual so it is quite a mouthful if you try to eat the whole piece in a go. The ribs are great!1000 layered bean curd (10/10) - presented beautifully and tasted exceptionally too! Can't ask for moreDuo Vermicelli braised in pumpkin broth (10/10) - a unique carbo dish that will tickle your taste bud to tell you to at more even on a full stomach! Slightly too heavy on the ginger if you do not like ginger
3
Service was good, we were advised on sufficient portions, but taste of food was average at best, and there was a very foul murky smell when we entered the restaurant. last course of the suckling pig was almost left out though until we reminded the server.
4
Located on the rooftop of the National Gallery Singapore, this modern restaurant under the Park Hotel group serves fine Cantonese cuisine in a nice ambience
4
Beautiful serene setting in the national art gallery has a peaceful effect on you while approaching the restaurant. Famous for its Cantonese cuisine the food offers authenticity and visual delight as you go along discovering the various dishes magically designed by the chef. Large groups will quite enjoy the convivial atmosphere and togetherness and equally good for families and couples. Take your time to choose the wines that go well with Chinese food
3
The restaurant set up is claustrophobic and the booth seats made small group dining inconvenient and uncomfortable. Food is average tasting but price is expensive (the dishes I ate in the pictures on this visit cost about $80 per person for the 5 of us). Service competent but cold
4
Had a CNY Yuan Xiao dinner at YAN with a customised menu by Chef Chan. Almost all 9 dishes were faultless! From unique ShunDe yusheng to steam fish and Peking duck, the guests were impressed. The Peking duck was one of the best I have eaten, even the chopped up carcass was delicious, without any gamey smell , which those at "specialised" Peking Duck restaurants can't get it right even.Every dish was skillfully prepared and all my guests were actually pleasantly surprised at the generous portions!The only grouse was the "moody" service by the staff. Would have earned a 5-star experience if the staff could have a "service with a smile". When asked for a wifi password, was rudely told the password cannot be disclosed. Half- consumed food were promptly cleared without asking if we were done eating! The final straw was a guest's totally untouched 4-head whole abalone was whisked off literally under our nose and we had to shout to stop the waitress! What a shame such good food was spoilt by service that leaves a bad taste
3
We had our CNY dinner with our supplier and were looking forward after reading so much good reviews on this restaurant. Sad to say, it was not up to our expectation ...Seriously, "the dishes are of no big deal" as one review has indicated but I must give credit to the 'Roast Crispy Chicken', the breast meat is tender, unlike some other restaurants. The 'Denggui Roast Duck' is a disappointment, does not have the denggui taste & smell. Of all the dishes that we had, the only dish that I can give a 4 thumbs up is the Braised Noodle with live prawns. Prawns were big and fresh and the noodle has that 'q-q' & fragrance after I chew on it. Ok, another point to give is "portion is big". More than sufficient for a table of 10.Staff are friendly and the recommendation for red wine was good. Well, night view of the Padang, MBS, Esplanade and Singapore Flyer is breath-taking. A must after the meal
5
Great food and atmosphere. The service staff was friendly and helpful. The family had a great time!!
4
The place is cosy n we were seated at a round table with sofa very comfortable
They have a very beautiful artistic door that Manu ppl may no notice
5
Well located on top of National Gallery, the cozy sofa seats are spacy. Dim sum and soup are must-to-try
3
Very disappointed with the small serving amount of some dishes . Gallery insider discount card cannot be used for this restaurant during festive period .
5
Excellent Suckling Pig which is the best I ever had.Would come in group next time to try out more dishes.Service is good to
4
The food was nice and the place was not crowded. This is a plus point for a family gathering. However, the food was expensive
5
This was a night to remember. We were kindly taken there by Grand Park City Hall Hotel and Wow it was fantastic. We were greeted by the Manager CK who had kindly organised a 6 course meal. This started with the best Peking Duck we have ever had. Followed by scallops in pumpkin soup. Then beef and asparagus etc etc The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect. It was the best Cantonese food my husband and I have ever had and CK ensured that the evening was so special for us. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Thank you so much to Grand Park City Hall and to the team at Yan. You made us feel so special. If in Singapore do not miss this restaurant. It is a must
4
the dishes were generally quite gd with wok hei, service was prompt too. will return. a minor comment on the seafood items like prawns, scallops, could be abit more fresh
5
This is an elegant restaurant with great food and very helpful staff. The Peking Duck was superb (better than the Peking Duck we had in Hong Kong) as were the various dumplings. Have a cocktail at Smoke and Mirrors upstairs and enjoy the views out over the open field of the Singapore Cricket club to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel then go down stairs to the comfortable booths of the Yan restaurant. This is a restaurant to go back to next time we are in Singapore
4
Went for Sunday dinner and restaurant was somewhat packed. Place was not big with sofa seats available. Looks cozy but ceiling was a tad low and appeared cramped. Food ordered was good- Peking duck, hot and sour broth served in coconut, beef cubes, thousand layered beancurd and crispy ball noodles. Service throughout was friendly and prompt especially the servers whom I must give credit to.
4
Booked Yan for dinner to celebrate mom's birthday and Mom was not disappointed. Fried rice with crab meat was well done with abundant amount of crab meat. The roast meat combination of honey BBQ pork and duck was delicious as well and the duck skin roasted to perfection. Egg white and prawn was fairly average and probably would not be recommended. Wasabi-mayo prawn was on point though and fresh. The sweet and sour pork was crispy and tasty. The desserts were generally good too and would highly recommend the mango cream and ice cream in young coconut. The herbal jelly and almond cream was average and nothing to shout about.Service was prompt with tea topped up and plates changed as expected of restaurants of this standard.Prices however are on the high side so do expect the bill to be fairly steep.
5
They serve awesome dim sum though price might be slightly higher than others. But worth paying for it. Will visit again... MUST TRY!
1
The food is not worth the money.
The service is not good. The waiter is not responding and no smile.
1
So much hype but service was poor and food was blah. They were understaffed or just basically untrained.
4
had the dim sum platter, crab bun, soup in coconut. All were presented beautifully. Service and restaurant ambience were commendable. Would be happy to visit for another meal again!
4
First visit to Yan. Brought a foreign guest and settled for the set lunch plus added Peking duck n roast pork. Roast pork n sets were good but I have eaten better Peking duck elsewhere.
4
Great service and awesome food, especially the beef. Fine place for gathering too. Will be back for more.
5
Yan is located on the 5th floor of the National Gallery, which makes it a great pit stop before, during or after visiting the museum. The dim sum are very sophisticated and well done. The soups - in particular the hot and sour soup with crab claw and scallops served in a coconut - deserve a shout-out. Do not pass up on dessert, especially the ice-cream, coconut ice and mango served (again) in a coconut. Service was professional

It was difficult to find Yan, as is everything else in the National Gallery whose architecture is magnificent but not easy to navigate. The food at Yan was good. The waiters were very busy and it was not easy to atract their attention. I asked for the ladies' room and was hastily shown a vague direction outside. The ladies' room ended up being in the opposite direction. The price was all right for the setting and Singapore

Ambiance was good, food average but service could have been much better. Although the restaurant was less than a quarter full, service staff took 20 mins before they came to take the order and another 10 mins and 3 reminders before tea was served. We ordered the set meal and the pacing of the courses was poor, with one course being served before the one before was finished. At one point, we had 3 courses on the table - the soup, fish and vegetables. This resulted in cold food by the time we got to it

Disappointing dining experience. Made reservations at 6pm but most items were sold out or N.A (example - roast chicken, mushrooms, char siew, etc..) Really not too sure what was going on. We ordered by asking the waitress what is left. A little ridiculous since the restaurant opens for dinner at 6pm. Was brought menu with missing pages. When asked where the vegetable options were (missing pages), waitress mentioned that there is no such page and that vegetable orders are "free-style". Only realized that is not true when we took another menu to order dessert. By then it was too late since we are already towards the end of our meal.Food quality is generally only okay. Most of the food actually came quite cold. Especially the noodles. Would have expected more for the price which we are paying. Never coming back here again

we went to the restaurant on Monday just after F1 finished. So the restaurant was quiet. we enjoyed food very much.
3
Roast pig was as good as raved online. Quality of the cooking was good but the service needs work. I would go back again, if only for the pig.
4
The Peking duck was delicious and meat is very tender. Rest of other dishes were equally good. We experience good services from the team

Cantonese cuisine has always been the best of Chinese cooking whichever you look at it.At Yan, I have yet to ascertain whether this is among the best of Cantonese, as yet.I only have the opportunity to savour only 3 dishes, after all, how much can 2 diners eat in one sitting.Peiking Duck was good but not as good as those I have tasted in Beijing, obviously.Taste aside, the wrapped morsel is not served hot from the wok, so to speak.Am also referring to those in Beijing where the duck is brought to you sizzling hot !When you had something of the best, nothing else come close.The side dish, the usual side that comes with the duck skin, was although good but again not exceptional.The Tofu dish (forgot the name), something called a thousand layered tofu was truly excellent.Very refine-ly sliced and artistically arranged in a circle, was indeed next to perfection.Both visually pleasing and fresh tasting tofu served warm.Did not expect the dish to be served warm, a pleasant surprise !I always do not have the heart to dip into something aesthetically pleasing, especially when the chef have painstakingly spent time and skill preparing them.Restaurant interior ID although relatively old and outdated has a good feel.Diners were spread out ensuring privacy, not like most restaurants where waiters are inclined to herd diners in a corner and block off other areas.Reason being, less walking distance for them to serve at the expense of diners breathing space.I like restaurants with such space in between diners..........who wouldn't ?Lastly, the service was excellent.We had a pleasant surprise when we were given complimentary desserts on our first visit.Complimentary from the Restaurant Manager, Mr Sek who spoke Cantonese (of course, from HK) and good English.My expectations has always been, without saying, Cantonese speaking waiters in a cantonese Restaurant.BTW, all of them speak Cantonese............ in Yan and that includes the Chef........

This modern and streamlined restaurant has nice circular booths that are separated from each other by a panel of threads that give a feeling of privacy. It is easily accessible from the carpark of the National Gallery, and approached via an attractive courtyard with views of the Supreme Court. Service is friendly and professional, and the tasty set lunch features the fresh ingredients and an interesting menu of complementary flavours and textures. At $38++, the lunch is very fairly priced for a place of this calibre. Highly recommended

Invited to YumCha at Yan, I was not expecting such a fine dining environment. There was none of the hustle and bustle of the usual Chinese restaurant - the restaurant was empty when I went there. That said, the food was excellent and the service most attentive, with prices to match
4
So it was a Saturday night and the place looks half empty even though a lot of the other restaurants at national Gallery were full. Food was surprisingly good - peking duck, roast beef with peppers, nicely stir-fried broccoli etc, It was really good. Service was so-so
5
As it was my mother's 60th birthday, it was decided that we would want to being her to somewhere memorable and serves good Chinese food. Found this place online and decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. It was a great choice. Food was excellent, dim sum were all handmade upon order and the manager also offered us specially made longevity buns with Char siew filings. A very good gesture and we really enjoyed the food and the service there. We'll definitely patronize again.P.S.: peking duck, dim sum and the soups are a must try

Very disappointed for what we planned as a fine dining experience. 1st impression is underwhelming decor with zero view in what is a great settling with the National Gallery. We chose Fan based on reviews & expectations of great food, however all 7 of us left underwhelmed by the quality, flavour & creativity of the dishes. There isn't a single dish I'd want to try again! Their Peking duck was bland & dry, the steamed soon hock fish pitifully small & dull. Only decent dish was the Golden pumpkin broth with fresh crab meat. Shortest wine list in Singapore with only 7 options (covering red, white & rose) & only by the glass. So many better options than Yan, so look elsewhere.

ave service for above ave price, there is room for a lot of improvement, wont visit again in near future

Came here for family lunch.
They have good dim sum, soup and dessert. The Peking duck is good although as crispy as Imperial Treasure Super Duck. Plus point is that the restaurant is not noisy unlike most Chinese restaurant.
4
Trying new Cantonese place, the dian xin platters is nice. Dad and grandpa enjoyed the food. The service staff is also helpful.
4
tim sum delicious. dumpling excellent big enough for two person. The captain is good and experienced and help you to make recommendation quickly.
5
Food quality is very good and yummy. Service is pleasant and helpful. Location is excellent. After meal, we took a troll around to help digestion. It was memorable experience.
4
The dim sum was not the best that I had, but yan restaurant is worth a visit especially with the HSBC credit card promotion of 15%.
4
Brought customers there for dinner. Food was good especially the Pekin duck meat which was just served directly without frying.
Only thing that can be improved is the service which seems to be lack of manpower
3
We had the dinner fixed menu. The dishes were mixed in quality. It started on a poor note when the soup came out before the first plate of char siew pork and roast duck. I've NEVER experienced a botch up like that in a restaurant that charges the high prices Yan does. Staff need to be better trained. Sea perch was delicious as was the dessert. Will not be returning as too expensive for the inconsistency and service.

Came here for a business dinner this week and sampled a selection of dishes. The Peking Duck was pretty good, as was most of the food. Portions were a little on the small side, but because we ordered quite a lot of food this wasn't a big issue. Small but decent selection of craft beers
3
Portions are small and the food is simple so you do feel like you've eaten a healthy meal. The double-boiled chicken soup with sea whelk was really just a plain consommé. Sautéed lobster with egg white and broccoli was not very tasty. Braised vermicelli with diced scallops was very plain and the scallops couldn't be found. However the suckling pig and the dessert - chilled apricot with sea coconut- was above average. The ambience of the restaurant is pleasant and is in the National Gallery - a beautiful historic building. Service was uninspiring.
4
Cozy place that serve above average food and Service is good. Must try suckling pig done in three ways.
3
Very average place. Food is serviceable. Service a bit slow. Ambience is average and uninspiring. Nothing special
4
We ate here for a work dinner. The venue was nice and modern - looked out over the rooftop area. Food wasn't bad - we had roast pig, soup, fish, etc.
Probably a better venue for family lunches and dinners than business lunches.
4
5 of us had dinner here; Peking Duck served 2 ways, chicken soup with bamboo pith, vermicelli with scallops and their signature coconut and mango dessert. Outstanding food. Very tasty and beautifully presented.The ambience was really good too. So it was a bit disappointing that the service could have been a bit more attentive and carried out with a bit more panache. It would have been the icing on the cake.Nevertheless, it was a good dining experince
4
It was a dinner with just myself and an elderly teacher who is in his late 70's. His appetite is small but we both enjoy the ambience and the helpfulness of the manager of the restaurant who kindly introduce us with their signature dish. We had their slow boiled soup which happened to be the lotus root soup. Absolutely yummy!We also had the stewed Yee-Mee and a stir fried kailan with beed. The beef turned out to be very tender and delicious.A great experience at the National Gallery of SIngapore.
4
We were there for a special occasion, The service was prompt and courteous considering there were 30 of us enjoying a banquet with suckling pig etc. This is not your normal run of the mill chinese/cantonese food; you can appreciate the attention in preparation resulting in some artistic presentation. This is close enough to fine dining.They even took the trouble, at last minute notice, to cater specially for one of our guest who is lactose intolerant!That defines a good restaurant from the "chaff"What price are you willing to pay? We had a wonderful time

This is a nice restaurant inside the National Gallery. We ordered the piglet in advance. It was really good! The other dishes were average. But this place has nice ambience and good service. Have returned twice since Gallery's opening. Gallery Insider member gets a discount with your membership card. Nice

We had a CNY dinner at Yan last week. The restaurant is on the 5th floor of the newly opened NAG. The interior design is nice and bright. Ceiling feels a bit low. We had a private room that was surprisingly dirty. The floor was covered with bits and pieces of food and some unused toothpick.The food was so-so, and portions were surprisingly small. We had a set menu but there was no explanation nor a printed menu on the table.Luckily I did not pay the bill, but I saw it and I was shocked how high the pricing came out to be. Even by inflated Singapore pricing a bit too much in my opinion. Will not return.Toilets are outside, very far away from the restaurant and compared to normal Singapore measures not so nice

This restaurant is on the 5th floor of the National gallery. The whole setting is special. The backdrop is a rooftop garden and Singapore skyline view is exceptional. The general manager Mr Chi Kuen Shek was extremely helpful. He helped choose our wine, a 2008 Rioja and order our food - black pepper tofu, steamed perch, roast duck and crab fried rice. Every dish was delicious. The fish has a delicate flavor and the duck was so moist and came with an apple sauce that blended so well - brought the flavor out. This place is new and has few reviews but definitely deserves to be visited during a Singapore visit.

Yan (å®´) was previously Park Palace Chinese Restaurant at Grand Park Hotel @ City Hall. It serves delicious dim sum for lunch and excellent Cantonese dishes for dinner. One of their excellent dishes is the roast duck. It's well grilled crispy skin with the tasty meat makes it a dish that can be sold out on crowded days. The roast chicken is just as great.
