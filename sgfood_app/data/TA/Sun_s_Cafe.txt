Nothing unique about the buffet spread and maybe because it is Chinese New Year period, I dont find the food very special. The place is quite worn and the airconditioning probably need to be upgraded.

Elderly servers but full of personal touch! Good perankan food at decent prices especially when you opt for the DBS or UON 1 for 1 promotions!

We ate at the restaurant when we stayed at this hotel. The hotel itself was very average and we have found another that we stay at now when we visit Singapore. The food, though, is excellent and reasonably priced
3
Reasonable price with a good range of both hot and cold food although authenticity of Peranakan cuisine should be taken with a pinch of salt.
Service was very good as staff was great in clearing dishes and catering to diners' needs.

I tried the weekday lunch which was included as part of a course that I attended; after the meal, I thought thank goodness I didn't need to pay for it. The laksa and meat ball soup was average at best. Green mussels with chili crab sauce were overcooked. The roast duck was rubbery and dry. Curry chicken was tough. The fried fish was fresh but bland. The DIY popiah was nothing to rave about, while the nonya kueh and dessert were also average. But I admit that it was value for money and apparently elderly people seem to love the food. The staff were also friendly and helpful.

went weekdays dinner buffet, not much people. dishes as usual. pork soup, salad, deserts, ice cream, prawn, mussels. chicken curry was delicious as well as the sotong and prawn. porridge especially the prawn one was nice, and very smoothing. Staff were polite, and clear dish very fast

This restaurant has the space for big family gatherings and serves a large food variety. Price is very reasonable if you buy through fave. We went for the variety and fusion of Peranakan and local cuisines but they were pretty ordinary. Well, you can’t complain if you want to gather a big group and chitchat over lunch or dinner. Frankly, I prefer the desserts spread over the food spread! A must try as its soft on your pocket

9-9-2017 my second time write review for this restaurant, nice food comfortable seating but terrible service AGAIN. -we reached there 10mins in advance. was told to wait outside untill 6:30pm. and small table with 8chairs were taken. so no choice we have to stand outside near front desk like so awkward. -6:31 we start to enter the restaurant, provide to the restaurant reception aunty our reservation detail and she asked her colleague to bring us to the seat. but the manager show us "STOP "hand signal but we just ignore him and follow the staff to our seat (pretty sure not "Hi", BTW from the time we step in this restaurant until we finish dinner and left. I never hear any "hi welcome thank you " these basic service language AT ALL. all the staff with their blank /black face. but thanks God. food did't disappointed us. thanks to chefs team. and I wish they can do something with their service. maybe a proper training. picture attached shows my grandma has no choice to sit at corner of hotel lobby. and outside restaurant are ppl who waiting to go in for dinner. and thanks manger with his service team juz stand their with blank face and looking at us

We had a great gathering yesterday 5 Sep with a big group of 20 of us. Food choices of fusion and peranakan cuisine. The ambience was good and spacious. Food were tasty and we all enjoyed the delicious food. We had a good time and glad to meet one another after 28 years. We were ex colleagues and pick the right place to meet. Very convenient walking distance from MRT Bugis or city hall

If not for the credit card promo, i would not have come. Have a little "unhappiness" as it was a 1-for-1 promo. I had 3adults and 1child in my group but i was told that the child need to pay as promo is for adult!Its ridiculous as adult price is higher no? The lady told me that i can go bring along one more adult to eat for free but the child need to pay! I am confuse. Anywayz, there was no fine prints or indication that the child cannot be spare off the charges despite i had paid for two adult full price.Oh...I read thru reviews on other sites such as chope, and they were poorly written. Thus i came mentally prepared.Besides service is lousy, the food is "so-so"...not hotel standard.Laksa gravy taste like plain water, kuwh dadar skin is artificial coloured (or at least it tastsed like and is DARK GREEN!), Kueh Ambon is plain white in colours....obviously cost cutting lack of eggd, beef rendang taste more like overly sweeten beef in satay peanut sauce, assam shrimps got no taste at all....ewee....babi pongteh also tak sedap la...Even after the 1-for-1 offer, is still not worth as the hotel ambience feels like canteen with large tour group crowd yelling n jumping queue.The manGement may consider having enough host or staff to ensurd guests do not jump queue....oh ya the staff damm self got bad attitude so what else to expect...only choice is i m not returning again unless i feel like paying for staff canteen quality food in a aircon seating area

Nothing special but it is an O.K. breakfast buffet. Omelet was good. Service was nice. Not bad for a hotel place, a bit pricy.
3
I was there for a dinner buffet. Very limited variety of food. Kueh does not seem to be fresh. Rest of the dishes tasted mediocre.
Good variety of fruits.
3
Well,quit a distance to bugis MRT station,many variety. cooked food. soup. noodle bar. dessert ice cream and ice kachang. food is well replenished. sitting is comfortable. service provided by staff really need to be improved.i mean server cleaning empty plates for us yet they are NOT welcoming and friendly at all~3 star rating go for food and good place to enjoy with friends and familie
4
For around SGD residents can get a really good breakfast. All the normal cold and hot dishes ( Western and Asian) plus an egg station for Omelettes/ eggs to order. No rush and good service. Temperature can be a bit cold if sitting under one of the air con units- best to have a table away from those
4
Small range of dishes but all are genuine and tasty! If you have UOB or DBS card, you get 1 for 1 offer ie if you have 6 persons, you only have to pay for 3! Location is good --you can walk from Bras Basah MRT. You can also explore the historic vicinity after a good meal
4
If you want to get a taste of traditional food of old Singapore colonial times pay avisit to this buffet style restaurant. It opens at 6:30 in the evening and often offers a 1 for 1 dining, which will at that rate cost you approx. 20 SGD/pax. The food is good, freshly prepared and regularily refilled. Service is attentive and we had a very nice time despite the place was quite well visited

We tried the buffet lunch today with Groupon coupon (about half normal price). The good news was that they kindly slotted us in though we forgot to make a reservation even after noting they were fully booked.Bad news- on basis that we are foodies, the Nyonya food was at best mediocre, missing the extra bit of freshness and preparation that catapults food into the GOOD range.Laksa - packaged Prima Laksa made at home is betterKueh Pie Tee - the vegies seems just boiled, not much flavor. The cup seemed not fresh, with "old" taste, not savory.Belly Pork - was not stewed long enough, the fatty meat/skin a bit chewy.Bee Hoon - not good.Things sort of OK:Steamed Fish with Light Soy SaucePrawnsChicken CurryIce CreamBest Thing:Salted Vegy Soup, but still not as good as home made.So if you are foodies don't bother, especially if you don't have a half price coupon

Hotel outlets that boast buffet spreads are a dime a dozen, but if they are enhanced by good service; they are all the better. This cafe is one example.Brightly lit and having tables quite spaced out, the spread was Peranakan and laid out quite extensively at the cafe's center. The piped-in music could be a little louder as the patrons were drowning it out. The on-going promotion of a "2 for the price of 1" drew the crowds in. From the live station, manned by an experienced chef; one could enjoy a bowl of laksa or pork ball noodles. Incidentally, those not in favour of pork need only look out for the word on the food tags. Our table was well taken of and all empty plates were cleared within minutes. In summary, it is definitely a place to return.

Bought their Peranakan buffet lunch through Groupon. It is quite worth it for $20 buffet lunch during weekday. They have quite a good spread of Nyonya food such as Laksa, curry chicken, nyonya kuih, kuih pie tie, ice-kacang, etc. They even have cincalok! Just that it's a pity they do not offer buah keluak chicken. It will wonderful
1
Do yourselves a favour, eat your breakfast in McDonalds! The food was quite tasteless, with very little in terms of choice. Poor imitation of an international buffet breakfast. Only redeeming quality are the great and tireless service of the staff at Sun Cafe and the egg and waffle section
4
We hosted a business buffet lunch here. They served a good spread of Nonya food, including Laksa, Babi Pongteh, Curry Chicken, Spicy Prawns, Pig Stomach Soup, etc. Good place for business lunch.
3
Not much of varieties on weekdays, is value for money if using groupon.
Only find a few dishes nice, like their sambal prawns with petai, kuih Pie Tee,laksa and hokkien mee,
4
The food is quite good for the buffet. If you are staying at the Grand Pacific, you can get 30% off the meals. The Buffet has great choices at a very reasonable price for SG.
5
had three buffet breakfasts with them ..... food quality was very good .... need to work on the menu a bit ...
3
The breakfast is basic but very convenient if you want to grab a bite without dressing up too much. Recommend a B&B basis booking everytime.
4
As hotel food goes this is good but not amazing-staff are lovely though and helpful. Food well prepared and the buffet options were varied and well presented.
4
I have my breakfast here while I stayed at Hotel Grand Pacific. Food choices are fresh and delicious.

We were in Singapore for a few days' visit and my friends and my husband and I decided to try the nonya food at Sun Cafe which I have heard so much about.I was happily rewarded. There were all many peranakan dishes that I grew up with and which I have not eaten for many years. There were the meat rolls, pig stomach soup, fatty pork salad, curry, braised pork belly and look and behold, a variety of nonya and Malay kuihs - all my favourites! So I pigged out!A bit pricey at around S$40 pp but if you are lucky enough to get the Groupon vouchers, you pay only around S$20 pp! A steal in in Singapore

This cafÃ© is located within Hotel Grand Pacific. Used to be known as Allison hotel in her hay days where the hotel was famous for local hi-tea.So we were glad to come back. There was a Peranakan Buffet promotion.We had visitors so it was good to showcase Peranakan food for a change.Having variety of delicious food makes a great difference.Love the laksa. Comes in small portion so you can try it and if you like order more.The beef rendang was soft, tender and sedap!There are spicy prawns, sambal fish, vegetable tempura, mixed vegetables, rojak, chicken curry, 5 spice roll, Kueh pie ti ( minced vege and egg in small crispy pastry shell or cup), porridge, Assam fish, etc.The buffet comes with free flow rose prune drink which is like a prune juice with rose fragrant so it was refreshing. The chef came around and explain the food to us. He was great. Very customer focus which you don't see much in hotels these days.The service staff and manager , guy in suit at the restaurant deserves a raise.Very attentive and prompt in service.We do not need to ask for warm water, he knows one guest needs warm water and went extra mile.The service staff came to clear empty plates fast so our table is neat.The ambience was also cosy.Location along Victoria street, behind ntuc income office. They serve buffet both lunch and dinner.Price about $$38+++ per person and a dollar or two more weekends per person. The buffet includes coffee and tea plus dessert as well so overall a good price.However, during these two mths till November, there is promotion through groupon website.You pay almost 46% less. $21+++ so it is definitely a steal!Well done! So go before promotion ends or go after promotions if you can afford normal price. Most important when we think peranakan, it is a bonding time for family minus the kebaya!nearest mrt city hall. Bugis village about 100m away. Opposite bras bersah complex.Only challenge is waiting for taxi at night. Guess it is a Singapore issue.We will definitely go back soon

If you're craving for some Peranankan Fare at affordable prices, head to Sun's Cafe. Been here twice with the latest being in August 2015. Mum especially loves the food and she's Peranakan so that's saying something. Laksa, Prawn Noodles, Sambal Chili, Pig Stomach's Soup, Mee Rebus, Rojak and an assorted array of Peranakan Desserts!Good food choices that are fresh and delicious! Must-try
3
Quiet and cozy restaurant. Value for money but do not expect oyster and sashimi. Didnt like their laksa and coffee.
4
Nice and quick staff.
Had the Chinese dinner buffet, it was very tasty and had plenty of choices.
Tried the breakfast as well, it was plenty and well tasting.
4
I like the flat white coffee served with cake and muffins. The environment is clean and staffs are friendly and helpful

Nyonya cooking made popular by the Peranakans, is the result of blending Chinese ingredients with spices and cooking techniques used by the Malay and Indonesian community. Though you are spoiled for food choices in Singapore - local, western, fusion, etc - it's not everyday that you stumble upon great Peranakan restaurants, at a price that's not going to drill a hole in your wallet. Sun's Cafe at the Hotel Grand Pacific is one such place. Their Peranakan Buffet is certainly worth a trip, with yummy dishes aplenty, all for a good price. My husband and I were there on a Saturday and the place was packed! And after going through the dishes - kwey teow, pig trotters, fish with sambal, nasi lemak, etc - it was pretty easy to understand why. Food quality is definitely better than average and there's more than enough of it to get you through second or third rounds - if you have that big an appetite. I particularly like their local desserts as well, especially lapis kueh. Though I was mildly disappointed that they didn't have ice kacang that day. I remember when we were there last time (two years ago, I believe), I was a regular at the ice kacang station, haha. If you are going for any of their buffet deals during the weekend, I suggest you make prior table reservations or at least show up early (for lunch or dinner) as there can be plenty of diners. The restaurant itself is not much to look at, in terms of interior design. In fact, you would say it looks dated. However, it does offer much more when it comes to food and that, to me, is even more important. The staff, too, were friendly and nice to the customers

There is laksa and prawn noodle and both taste nice. Sambal chill is nice. There is pig stomach soup which was delicious. Overall, the food there is nice and well topped up. The fried fish is nice too and Rojak. Just that there is no salmon, oysters or cold prawns. But for the price, I can understand why.

We had 3 nights at the Grand Pacific last month , we ate Breakfast each morning in Suns Cafe and had Dinner on 2 nights . Each meal was excellent . The Dinner was "A la Carte" though they do have an Asian Themed Buffet. My Wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed our meals . The service was excellent , and very reasonably priced . Highly recommend if you stay at the Grand Pacific that you Dine in

We selected the lunchtime buffet which gave a discount to hotel guests. There was plenty of variety including salads, noodles and spicy Malaysian food. The buffet also included fresh fruits, desserts, tea and coffee. Although the flavours of the food were very good we felt that some of the meat dishes could have been a little more tender
4
I had the pleasure of staying in Hotel Grand Pacific in September 2014 and thereby had breakfast at Sun's cafe. Good cozy environment and quite a lot on the menu. Just that I have to stick to salad and fresh fruits since I'm a muslims and want to only opt to Halal food. Segregating dishes in terms of what uses Halal ingredients and what doesn't would make it an excellent place to be
3
Very good price/quality if staying at the Grand Pacific Hotel in the same building. Hotel guests get substantial reduction

I visited this restaurant with my entire family twice as everyone loved peranakan food. We enjoyed the simple food but what stood out the most was the responsiveness of the staff. On my first visit, we were given a seat on the upper level. When my elderly parents arrived, the staff apologised profusely was they had to climb a small fleet of stairs up to the upper level. The wait staff were extremely attentive. When they saw the elderly holding food and trying to climb the stairs, they automatically helped my parents to bring the food to the table. We were so impressed by them that we reserved another table today. This time round, while the food and wait staff were still as impressive, we made a complaint against the concierge staff. My uncle who was driving a car with a blue handicap label, tried to get their concierge to remove the barrier to the wheelchair lot. As the concierge was not in sight, we approached the front desk for assistance with the barrier. They sent a big burly ill mannered man, Velu to help us. Without even checking, he immediately asked us how long were we going to park in the handicap lot and limited us to an hour. He went to my uncle to check the validity of the blue handicap label and had the audacity to tell my uncle that he needs to be handicap too in order to have the blue label. My uncle was extremely unhappy about it. While he did not require a wheelchair at that time, he still limped and at times required further assistance in walking. There was no need for the concierge to pass such unecessary comments. It spoilt our family's lunch gathering. When i confronted him later on, he kept insisting that it was the hotel's policy to run strict checks on cars with the handicap label. He refused to apologise as he felt that he did nothing wrong by questioning the driver. While i agree that checks should be made to validate that the vehicle has a valid wheelchair label, but he had no right to comment on the person's handicap status. Just because a person does not use a wheelchair does not mean that he is not a handicap. It such a shame that the hotel has made such great progress since its Allson hotel days only to have such a person around to spoil its name. This would be our last time dining there. There are more hotels out there who would welcome handicap guests and not question them
