JCO is a gem. MUCH better than ANY OTHER franchises. Its very popular amongst the locals and for good reason. They have a wide selection and are reasonably priced.

Staff were helpful and friendly.
J.Co Donuts are our favourite.
Much better than the other donut chain and cheaper.

Glad we found this place! They had tons of flavors we had never experienced before in donuts. My husband and I got the green tea flavor and the chocolate avococonut. I was not disappointed. Tasted fresh and the flavor was really good. Price was about average for specialty donuts to

I am not a sugar/wheat/carb fan, but for this donut, I will bend my rule. The best tasting, looking and variety of flavours puts this donut ahead of the pack. Been coming here to collect my sugar/wheat/carb fix when every I'm in Singapore, not matter the time of day. I've even had them vacuum pack a box to bring home with me :) to share with the kidz..

I always end up coming here for afternoon coffee on Sunday when I am in Suntec. No, the food is not great. I supposed its location has given them the advantage for business. The donuts were soft, so before you knew it, everything gone when you put them in your mouth. Was very disappointed when I tried their avocado donuts. The green icing was coloured green, not from avocado. The filling is made of cream only. Not even a single piece of avocado. So long as we order those basic donuts, it is acceptable

J.CO is a great donut place for both donut and non-donut lovers. Donut is known for its sweet characteristic and that differentiates J.CO from the rest as they offer unique flavors like avocado, cheesecake and almonds. Kids will love the JPops which has different places where they can choose from. J.CO also offers coffee, blended drinks and yogurt

For a while, J.Co's popularity is spreading across Southeast Asia like wild fire. Started in Indonesia, it quickly conquers Philippines and moves into Singapore. With Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme and high awareness of health consciousness, J.Co craze never caught up fully. The fact is, besides the catchy menu, there is nothing special about the products or the drinks ..
