I travel from India to Singapore just for this.
I would call this place the Best Japanese beef BBQ restaurant in Singapore.
So delicious and fun to be here.
Great Yakiniku!

It is not often one finds a Japanese restaurant specialized in meat, but if one does, it is usually excellent. That is certainly true for the Ito-Kacho restaurant - a bit hard to find on the fourth floor of the Mandarin Gallery, but once there the feast can start: delicious Kobe beef on the grill, washed down with equally delicious sake. It maes a change

Delicious BBQ with prime Wagyu Beef. This meet is slightly fatty, which make it more tasty. Reminds me a lot of Korean BBQ. You get your little pieces of meat and put it just for a short time on the hot grill in the middle of the table. Enjoyed it

We chanced upon Ito Kacho & entered without knowing it offers the best yakiniku ever! We ordered a chirashi + tempura set lunch & a ramen bowl but noticed other tables having yakiniku. So we ordered just a small portion to try out. They pampered us with an FOC appetiser of grilled yakiniku in chilli sauce that was totally tempting & tasted just superb!The set lunch was such good value - generous portions of fresh sashimi on rice and the tempura was coated with a light batter. Ramen soup, unlike others, wasn't too salty and we loved that they made it a more balanced meal with a good portion of sliced carrot, onion & bean sprouts. Best was the beef yakiniku - sliced just thick enough to be grilled about a minute on each side & with 2 choices of dipping sauce or squeeze a touch of lemon on it, heavenly! So glad the grill was clean to start with (some places have burnt grills which shows remnants from the previous meal!) and the meat was lean, really juicy & so delicious. A small portion of veg came with it - leek, pumpkin, romaine lettuce. Definitely a must-try! It doesn't come cheap though & set meals are not available for dinners; only ala carte menu offered in the evenings. We'll be back!

Had the Matsu platter and it was good. But it wld hv been a better experience if cld indicate the diff types of meat on the platter . There's 15% off w Citi card and Staff cld hv been more proactive & informed customers when making payment like some restaurants do. They also hv lunch sets that were under $20

The tuna sushi in my set was not fresh. I can taste the fishy and bad texture. The tempura was bad too. The batter is thick and hard. I wouldn't recommend going there for sashimi or sushi. Not sure about the other food though. This will be the 1 and only time I head here for sushi/sashimi.

We were looking for Korean/Japanese in the Orchard area and this was recommended by my in-laws. Wagyu is not the cheapest, but for quality you tend to pay more, and this was/is definitely worth the money. The meat was amazing if you did it right, and it is simply fun to grill the meat yourself... just make sure it's not well done. Staff was very friendly and despite not making any reservation, it didn't require much waiting time. With a bit of luck you might just experience the same. As I always like to put it, you gotta experience for yourselves, but I would recommend this place any time.

I had the Yakiniku set lunch at about $38.90 ++. It comes with 2 types of beef as well as a beef tongue . I do not eat beef tongue and asked for a replacement . The staff just said no . I did not mean to replace the tongue with beef . The staff simply turned me down without offering an alternative . I would have accepted a salad , a pickle or something with similar or even lower in value. I told her to leave the spot on the tray as empty . My sister also ordered the same set . The staff told me that she would place my share on my sister's tray . I declined the arrangement and asked her to leave the spot empty . When the food was served , the tongue was replaced with another kind of beef . I appreciate the kind gesture ; however , it was not my intention to be greedy and to exploit the situation. Throughout my stay at the hotel , the staff did not smile . She was not warm and did not show any hint of hospitality . In fact , I would say that she was sulky . It was one of the worst service I have ever encountered . It was more appalling as it is an established restaurant . Coming to the beef , it is top notched . The beef was of superb quality . It was flavourful, and the texture succulent . It was a pleasure gourmet experience. It was a pity regarding the poor service . Will I return ? Yes , I will . However , I hope that I will not be served by the same staff again . If the restaurant reads my review , you need to train your staff . The food is 5 thumbs up but the service and hospitality is 5 thumbs down .

Grilling is fun at Ito Kacho. This is the real yakiniku.Various types of beef and pork slices are served raw with veggies (pumpkin, leeks, corn, mushroom). You get to cook the meat and veggies by yourself, while catching up with family and friends. Makes dining fun and interactive. Just don't forget the food on the grill, or you'll get burnt beef and veggies. My suggestions for appetizers are potato salad and edamame. With hot green tea. Sets the tone for your nice dinner. Though grilling itself was fantastic, the meat quality was more notable.There were different beef types depending on the cut. No matter the type, allslices were soft and juicy, and the sauce provided a nice complement.Buttered shiitake mushrooms! Creamy and delicious. Another thing I also enjoyed was garlic rice. Perfect partner to grilled beef and pork.For dessert, i recommend what i had - red beans over sesame-flavored ice cream. Perfect ending. Outstanding service. Warm and attentive. There was almost no need to call the waitress because she was always there

I tried this place out at the recommendation of a Japanese friend. To me, this place is combination of Japanese and Korean. The kimchee, for instance, was really good. We also paired the beef plates with a nice saki and some Japanese beer. It was very good. The service was not the best, and we were not checked up on so frequently, but it was a minor annoyance. I would eat here again

This restaurant offer a large variety of food - I do love sushi, therefore did order it - EXCELLENT - they have only a few dishes of sushi, but super tasty

Ordered the japanese beef sampler, which is good because you can try different part and cut. Sauce also tasty, went there for early lunch, so not so crowded, but reservation recommended.

They serve japanese wagyu beef and US beef. I order some dishes of wagyu beef. For me the beef is ok, but it's not really wow...I was expecting more than this.
4
The restaurant is located on the 4th floor of Mandarin Gallery. We can order the meals started with appetizer, main course and closed with dessert. the lady who serves us was also kind and friendly.

Good dinner - with a mix of Wagyu , Chicken, Vegetables and Squid . Plus assortment of good Kimchi. The Wagyu was excellent and the rest as well. Very friendly service . For a full / balanced meal including sake and beer , the bill came at 80 SING a head. Will definitely go back. This said, to be clear, this has nothing to do with the Yakiniku restaurants you find in Tokyo ! Still have not found one frankly which compare to the quality which you find in Japan. But in Singapore , this beats the more expensive places ( Yazawa beeing one )

I was there on a Friday afternoon with my customers for their set lunch which I must say it's very value for money. This restaurant is in Mandarin Gallery where they house some of the highly popular branded brands, in the heart of Orchard road, Singapore famous shopping district. This restaurant serves 8 different sets of set lunch price at $25.80 ++ which includes a salad, soup, chawanmushi, tempura, wauyu beef, sashimi, sushi ... Portion of the set is reasonable and I can't finish.They also serve BBQ meat and their signature will be beef. Do note that the BBQ beef will be expensive depending on the kind and portion. Not too noisy restaurant where I can strike a decent conversation with my customers enjoying the great food and it won't burn a hole in your pocket as well. I'll recommend this restaurant to you and I believe you'll like it

it's one of those experiences where you see a sign for Wagyu beef and you're expecting a level of deliciousness and they fail miserably to deliver. I came here expecting something decent especially from a japanese restaurant serving wagyu but all the meats were tougher than i expected. We ordered 3 set meals and they all fell short of expectation. i mean even the salad was kinda poor looking. it was really poorly presented and only had 2 to 3 small pieces of lettuce

It's our 2nd visit after a few years. The restaurant is still thriving because they do serve quality food.It's not a place you could go often though because the bill adds to nearly $600 for our family of 7. We had Japanese tea which was complimentary. We ate barbecue wagyu beef, king crab and assorted vegetables. I like the spicy bean sauce to dip our bbq meat in. We also had king crab porridge. We were all full up from the meal and didn't have any room for dessert. It was a pleasant dining experience and would visit again

I was at Orchard Road with colleagues and we needed lunch. My boss recommended this restaurant as he has been here before. We went with his suggestion. The restaurant offers beef yakiniku as their main offering. For lunch, however, they also offered set lunch, of which there were multiple choices available.After looking at the menu, I settled for the Set lunch which was the ‘Chirashi bowl and Tempura’ set. There were loads of fresh sashimi atop the rice in a bowl. Unlike other restaurants, where the pieces of fish atop the rice are cubes/ leftovers cuts of sashimi, the ones here are whole slices of seafood that you would see atop sushi. This set also came with a bowl of salad, miso soup & an 'almost as big as a tennis ball' ice cream puff (not pictured). After eating it all, I was stuffed

Fancy a good Japanese style BBQ while in the midst of shopping in orchard? Tho can be considered a little pricy, look no further! Lots of variety of beef,(that simply melts in your mouth)to choose from! And they do have nice lamb and pork dishes to grill as well! I gotta add that the slightly creamy and eggy, potatoe salad is good! Also if you're in a group, or very hungry and want to balance out the meat, must order their seafood combo!!This time round, I tried their egg soup with beef base, not too bad as well! It was my second time back and they exceeded my expectations! Tho the place was quite crowded as it was a public holiday, service staff was still very attentive!! Last but not least, another really good reason why I like the place so much? Easy; no matter what you grill, you will leave the HARDLY smelling like you've been to a BBQ!! :) Thanks for reading my humble opinion! Cheers! Have a happy and blessed new year!
